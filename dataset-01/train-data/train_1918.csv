2,"Her voice is lovely , but the caliber of music is premature.","Charlotte has a great deal of potential. With time and tutoring she will blossom. Her debut CD simply should not have been so difficult. She struggles often and sings out of her strongest range. At many times during the CD I really enjoy listening. However, there are also times when I cringe. I find it difficult to listen to the entire CD without gettting annoyed by her immaturity. The problem is that she is marketed as a prodigy and expectations are set incredibly high. (ie. She's no Michael Jackson or LeAnn Rimes) I do look forward to her future career and listening to her as her voice matures in the years to come."
3,Odd sound,"I know she has incredible talent for one so young, but I found this cd more disturbing than relaxing. One moment her voice is soaring, the next she sounds like a six-year-old singing nursery rhymes. Of course, her voice has gotten better over the years, but still, this cd is just such an odd mixture, I found it difficult to enjoy it. Her voice is just too inconsistent. However, if you enjoy Charlotte Church because of her innocence and youth, I would like to recommend another singer- Aselin Debison. Her image is just as innocent, and her voice is pure, clear, and sweet. It may not have the strength of Charlotte's, but it's more consistent, and therefore more pleasing."
1,"""High Notes"" equals hype","Charlotte Church is quite frankly another singer whose hype and ""high notes"" have made her regarded sometimes as a prodigy and opera singer. I don't have perfect pitch, but I'm almost certain she does not go much higher than a high C. Well trained Mezzo's hit high C's. She makes the notes she sings sound high. Her vibrato sound horrible at the least. She sounds like an unchanged voice forcing itself to change. Her repotoire is appropriate for her age but the vibrato and ""adult fullness"" she adds are not. Some people say I'm jealous (I'm a fourteen year old lyric colorutra)of her fame and talent. I am only jealous of the former not the latter. She had the right connections to reach it to the top but when her voices goes through maturity she will come tumbling down."
5,This CD is wonderful !!,"Charlotte is unbeleivable for a 12 year old. Her rendition of Pie Jesu is beautiful. It is refreshing to hear such an angelic voice after a hard day at work, or on a lazy weekend playing with my daughter. This CD will enhance any collection of classical or opera music you have."
2,Technical perfection; no warmth,"It's true that Church's voice has a maturity beyond her years. However, I found that her rendition of ""Amazing Grace,"" ""The Lord's Prayer"" and ""Psalm 23,"" while technically correct, lacks feeling, and doesn't do justice to the redemptive and emotional value of the words."
5,Heavenly!,"I have PBS to originally thank for introducing me to Charlotte Church,and I watched and listened in amazement to the notes that floated fromher throat. Devoid of affectation, the voice of this child touched mysoul. I closed my eyes and felt my heart fill with joy over theprecious Pie Jesu and, to listen to ""When At Night I Go toSleep"" duet is something of which I will never tire. CharlotteChurch's enthusiasm to embrace both traditional Welsh songs, and puther personal imprint on more spiritual ones has made this one of mylistening favorites."
5,"Beautiful, Just Beautiful.","God has blessed Charlotte Church with a voice and a rare talent that comes along maybe once every 50 years, to sing His praises. She has a fine future ahead of her. Those who criticize her are just plain jealous and have no appreciation whatsoever of spiritual music. This CD uplifts the soul!"
3,Tantalizing,"I first heard this CD being played over the sound system in the Washington Tower Record store, and I was stunned. She sounded like the best boy soprano anyone has ever heard, but with roundness and depth I've never heard in a boy. All at once it hit me that centuries of tradition may have made a terrible mistake in using boys instead of girls.So I bought it, but it hasn't worn well. She is being pushed too hard here, singing higher than her voice is ready for. Interpretive variety and depth aren't there.Since then, it seems that when she's gone on TV she's mainly done large overblown productions with electronic amplification and big orchestra, instead of the intimate chamber style that better suits her voice. I'm afraid that what could have been a great lifetime career may be headed for early burnout.If she were to ask me for advice, which of course she hasn't, I would urge her to model her singing after Kathleen Battle's: Do what you can do very well, and don't try to do what you can't."
5,Truly the Voice of an Angel,This album is INCREDIBLE! I stumbbled onto it when I was looking for music to play in my wedding. I walked down the aisle to Pie Jesu and we also used Charlotte's version of the Lord's Prayer during the ceremony. It was perfect! I can not tell you how many people have asked about the songs and gone out and bought the album. You will completely love this album!
3,"Sorry, she gotta get down with Andrea Bocelli.","Once upon a time, I saw this teenage soprano on PBS. I bought this CD and wasn't the least bit surprised. Nice voice, but she oughta get down in the pop music world like almost everyone does. Maybe she will triumph thence. Suggestion: I'd go with Sarah Brightman or better still Andrea Bocelli any day of the week. The end."
1,Certainly not the voice of an angel...,It's simply embarrassing to listen to the poor child's ridiculously artificial singing. It certainly does not touch the heart of a listener with some musical understanding and interest in artistic quality. What I recommend is that Charlotte Church should take some lessons with a children's choir and stop pretending to be what she isn't.
1,boycott,"Given this young performer's recent disrespect of the Catholic Church, the Pope, etc, I will not support her by any means."
5,A Sublimely Inspiring Voice that Raises the Spirits.,"I was amazed at the Amazon reviewer's negative comments, and curious about the other detractors. (And sorry to see fellow singers near her own age so clearly expressing their jealousy over her voice getting attention and not theirs.) As to physical concerns - yes, it's possible her voice may be being pushed too much at too early an age and that's tragic. THE POINT OF A REVIEW, HOWEVER, IS TO COMMENT UPON THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCE ITSELF! She's wonderful - I'm not deeply ""religious"" but find her hymns so beautifully rendered that there are moments I could cry from the beauty. The folk songs make a nice balance for the album. I hope for the world's sake, that her career can mature along with her. She's given our family many moments of pleasure."
5,A beautiful voice for a 13 year old,"I only heard a part of this but from the first song I heard to the last, I was stunned. I couldn't believe that she was that young."
5,a 13 year-old musician's comments,"Charlotte Church has an extraordinary voice and amazing talent. She is gifted far beyond her years and has an incredible career to come. As a flute player, I'm very inspired by her. I hope one day I have the honor of performing with her. Go Charlotte!!!!!!"
3,"Good performance, but something is lacking","I don't think her voice is the voice of angel now. Her singing is good, but it's early to record it. If you want to buy it, you carefully listen to it. In the future, her voice will be the voice of angel."
3,"Good, not great","I got the CD this Christmas from a friend whose been a fan of Charlotte Church's since 'Voice of an Angel' first came out. In order to make my friend happy, I listened to the CD but I still don't know what's so great about it. The songs are cute; I think 'Pie Jesu' is sung too quickly, and like Sarah Brightman's version better than Charlotte's. 'Jerusalem' and 'I Vow To Thee. My Country' are two songs I enjoy a lot, as well as 'My Lagan Love.' The rest are alright. My only complaint is that her voice goes so weak when she hits low notes and it ruins the moment. I guess she'll have to try to work a little on the lower scale, especially if she wants to start singing pop songs. Overall, her voice is okay, but I've heard better. It's nothing special; it's just... nice."
3,Why Key Change?,"I have a problem with them changing the key (tranposing up) of In Trutina. This little tune from Orff's Carmina Burana is affecting in the way it really ""resonates"" (for lack of a better word) in it's original key. Maybe it shows her limited range, I don't know. Not getting more than 3 stars for that reason alone, Charlotte. Otherwise, it's a pleasant listening experience, uplifting at times."
2,Good for a young person but not outstanding,"I agree with other reviewers when they say that she sings with little technical expertise, most noticably breath control, phrasing, and actually FEELING something while you are singing. She shouldn't have made this CD so young. She'll probably grow up and mature into a nice professional voice. But I know several people who are as good/better than Charlotte Church and I agree that if you like this CD, you should try REAL opera, such as Callas, Sutherland, or others. You might find it to be better and certainly more culturally enriching than this CD, and don't be turned off because it's opera."
4,There is angels on Earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am 42 year old female that listens to pop and country. I saw Charolette on Jay Leno & Good Morning Amer. and this girl brought tears to my eyes-seriosly!! It was so ironic that I saw her a week apart here in the states. It was as though I was meant to see her both times. She sang Danny Boy the first time. I wish her well. I have a 13 yr. old myself and she is as bubbly as she is talented. From The U.S.-go girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Charlotte Church is the best!,"I first saw Charlotte Church perform on YTV, and within 10min I was on my way to HMV where I bought the CD (Voice of an Angel). Since then, I have never ceased to be amazed at how beautiful and well developed Charlotte Church's voice is. She truly has a talent way beyond her years, and I would recommend this CD to anyone. With a voice like her's, we can be sure to hear more from her in the near future."
2,"talented, but not exceptional","Although this young lady is talented, she is not an exceptional singer or performer. She is just young which makes people marvel, and I can understand that. However, if I were to choose a CD for operatic content, hers is not my choice.If you notice the reviews, most of those who do not like this CD are those who are educated in classical music and vocal technique, like myself. Those who find it fascinating and incredible are those who generally are NOT opera or classical music fans, and they tell you so in their reviews. Keep this in mind when buying this CD: if you are accustomed to quality classical performances, this one will disappoint."
3,Wonderful!,"I heard about Charlotte Church through both a magazine and Amazon, so I went out and bought the album on a whim. I'm so glad I did! She is fast becoming one of my favorites to listen to. I think she certainly has the potential, and give her a few more years, she could possibly be the next Sarah Brightman."
2,Fairly good performance but technically dissapointing...,"You've got to give her some credit! The voice is angelical and the music is appeasing. It is one of my favorites in the car after a long days'work. I'm however, appalled at the recorded sound, and it even tells you it was SBM processed. Difficult to believe as it does'nt project the individual instruments nor a perspective of the background. It is ill taped and apparently by amateurs at best. A remastered ADD from 40 years ago sounds better! This is a major setback in todays' standard, in an otherwise enjoyable performance, without getting picky at the genius limitations of a 13 year old."
1,it's called child labor,this isn't a good thing to be doing to a child's voice. the strain is showing now and will show worse as she gets older. this shouldn't be supported.
3,Not as wonderful as it is hyped up to be....,"I know I will get lots of negative feedback from this review, however, Miss Church has a sweet voice, but there is little emotion in the songs she sings. It sounds like she's just singing into a microphone because she has to. I understand that at 13 years old, it is amazing to have a voice like hers, but there's is no true emotion in her voice. I'm sorry."
1,An insult to those who sing,"The conception of this album alone makes a total mockery of those of us who actually indulge in the elements of voice, such as professional voice training. Sure, Charlotte Church is entertaining, perhaps cute, but she is no singer, much less a professional one."
3,Let the girl grow up.,"Young Ms. Church has an extraordinary talent for one so young. However, she is not ready for prime time. Despite moments of pure vocal magic, she cannot yet sustain her tones, and does not yet know how to nourish a phrase.The criticism in this case must go to her teachers and producers, who were obligated to work past her immaturity. Sometimes this would have required nothing more than holding a note for an additional count or two. Surely she was up to the task.How will this fine young voice develop? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, this disc is a wonderful curiosity item. This reviewer wishes this young lady all the best."
2,Overrated and Over-hyped,"It is nice that the public enjoys beautiful music purely performed, much in the tradition of boy sopranos in Great Britain. Belting it's not, and Charlotte's delivery is refreshingly simple and direct. That being said, the echo effects and background are clearly designed to give the voice a weight and aura it unsurprisingly does not possess. Also, though more subtle than belting, Charlotte is resorting to vocal tricks to inappropriately ""darken"" her sound (make it seem more mature) that are not good for her voice in the long run. I've heard a number of more talented and better-voiced singers at her age and younger that were not blessed or cursed with such publicity. Pretty sounds, yes. Voice of an angel? Give me a break!"
3,Reminiscent of the time of lost girlish innocence.,"I particularly enjoyed her presentations of In Trutina and the Prayer from Hansel and Gretel.I could have done without the extra frills and furbelows thrown into Amazing Grace, a la the so-called rock stars of today.She is on the verge of taking her first steps out of the door into a less than perfect, sometimes ugly world. When she discovers the power of proper breathing, her voice will probably surprise her! I hope to hear more of her as she develops."
2,"Nice Voice, Boring Sellections!","Okay yes Charlotte Church has a nice voice that is quite impressive considering she was only like 11 or 12 years old when she made this recording and I was very impressed when I heard her sing on a TV show so I bought this Voice Of An Angel CD and one of her other CDs, the one where she is wearing a red coat on the cover. Her voice is nice but to be honest I don't enjoy her CD's all that much, I can take Charlotte Church in small doses but not listen to a whole CD of her singing because some of the selections she chose are kind of insipid and just really don't interest me and that is just my personal opinion!"
5,Amazing!,"Charlotte Church is an amazing vocalist. Her voice is simply captivating. I am a 13 year old wanting to get into music, and Charlotte is definatly one of my influences. I can see (from different television appearances I've seen of hers) that she is an incredibly down-to-earth and sweet girl. She is a great role model for young people everywhere."
2,Not the greatest.,"I freely admit that I am no music expert. But I know when someone is off key. Just listen to the sample recording of The Lord's Prayer, especially the words ""name"" and ""heaven"", she wavers all over the place and seems to run out of breath. That might be fine for singing in my church choir but I expected something a little better from a ""prodigy"". I am of Welsh descent and would be proud to have a real 12-year-old prodigy representing the Welsh people. Unfortunately I don't think she is that outstanding and I am going to wait and see if her voice and technique improve. Her singing and technique seem mediocre to me. (By the way folks the angelic quality you think you are hearing is just an echo, not her voice. Even I sound good in the shower.)"
3,Too soon,"I was really looking forward to this CD because I had heard all about this ""child soprano wonder"" and was thinking that we had another Renee Fleming on our hands. Maybe someday Charlotte will rival some of the great opera stars we all know and love, but not now. Listening to the songs, her voice jumps back and fourth between a 14 year old voice and a 30 year old voice, which gets very annoying, very quickly. Reading the other reviews on here i noticed that many people were commenting on how she was going to damage her voice singing this stuff too young. Well, if she has a good voice coach (which i'm sure she does) then she will be fine. Sure, by the time she's 50 she wont be able to stay on pitch becuase her vibratto will be all over the place, but that hasnt really stoped some other sopranos in the past. My point is, this album was realeased too early, and to buy the one when she is at least 20, THAT ONE will be awsome."
2,What a shame,"Maybe it comes over much better live, but this CD was such a dissappointment. I suppose its a perfectly nice voice, but she has poor breath control, an unfocussed tone, little expression...It wouldn't be so bad, but there are so many young singers (boys and girls both) with better voices and better musicianship than this who get no chance to make themselves heard. So here's the bottom line. If this music isn't familiar to you, but you like it, great - now go out if you can to listen to some live performances of some of the music - try the Durufle - and welcome to the glories of classical singing. If you like listening to classical music and you like female singing - give this one a pass and buy some more von Otter instead."
1,Good Grief,"If the soundtrack to heaven is Charlotte Church's ear-splitting caterwauling, than please sign my name up on the eternal damnation sheet now. Thank you."
2,"She's all right, but...","I'm a soprano currently studying music in a university. I say she has done a lot to improve the public's opinion about opera and for that I am grateful. But, she is far to young to be preforming so much and to have cd out. Her voice will improve with age, and I'd much rather wait until she is able to use her talents to her fullest advantage before I buy anything. In the meantime, I'll buy cd's from the truly great prefomers. They will show you what it's supposed to sound like."
2,"Very good, but not there yet","She's nice and has a lot to offer, but I'd rather spend my money on Kathleen Battle, Kiri Te Kanawa, etc., etc."
4,WoW!I FINALLY FOUND CHARLOTTE CHURCH!SHE IS AWESOME!,"Well,I never thought I'd ever find Charlotte Church!She RULES!LATER......"
2,"Good, but not as good as the hype:","Charlotte does have a very beautiful voice. The young lady is indeed very talented. The comparison of her voice to that of a young boy's is right on. She is the same age and her voice the same maturity as theirs. I found the selections on this cd much more suited to her voice and personality than the ones on her other cd. As to her billing of ""opera singer"", I think not. Many of the local colleges provide better opera than she does. Her high notes were strident and shaky enough to make me uncomfortable. Also, I could not understand any of her words. As a linguist, I was saddened by this. I see vocal music as the incomprable combination of poetry and tone. To understand the poetry however, one must understand the individual words. Charlotte has tone but that's about it. I will love to hear her when her voice and her personality have matured and when she has developed other areas of her musicality."
4,only 12???,"My God...she has an amazing voice for a 12 year old...unbelievable. Her singing isn't yet very polished (as in not always being in tune, taking breaths where they shouldn't be taken)...but for her age she's still phenomenal. But I just couldn't give it 5 stars bc I beleive they rushed her to make a cd before she was mature enough."
3,The Mastered and Matured Voice Will Be One That Melts,"Even now the timbre and quality are astonishing that Charlotte displays on this debut effort. Her seemingly effortless aptitude produces a fresh soprano sound that is a joy to hear. It will be wonderful to hear her mature (as she has already displayed on her latest, self-titled CD)."
5,Breath taking,I heard her on the local radio program Z100 in NYC and I was in Tears as she sang. I ran and bought the CD and she has the most amazing voice that I have ever heard.
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The original ordered a week ago was confiscated by my sister so I have to order another copy.
2,Lovely but immature,"Charlotte Church has a wonderfully rich tone and a beautiful voice and will most likely grow up to be a fine singer. But to become a classical singer takes training beyond the age of 12 no matter how gifted you are. I don't understand why, beyond the cuteness factor, any recording studio would sign a 12-year-old when there are people out there with equally or more beautiful voices who actually know how to sing."
4,"The CD is good, the Video is Fantastic!","The ""Voice of an Angel"" CD is not exactly a masterpiece but it's quite wonderful in places. Her voice sounds considerably better on the concert video which was recorded about seven months later. Seven months is a big chunk of a kid's life so that explains the remarkable improvement. At any rate, I suspect we are witnessing in Charlotte Church the emergence of one of the finest female singers of all time."
2,Used Product,"The product was used, and the packaging was really bad. Never had such a bad experience with Amazon. [[ASIN:B004J2A9XTommy Hilfiger Men's 1790278 Blue Dial Stainless Steel Bracelet]]"
3,"buen producto, y rapidisimo envio","el reloj era tal y como se veia en foto y el envio para españa solo 6 dias, bien presentado y con todos los papeles, buena compra."
4,An interesting interpretation...,"This is a highly unconventional interpretation of ""Sleeping Beauty."" If you like strong male dancing and VERY innovative see-thru costuming, you will enjoy this version. Don't expect beauty from the princess, who is tall and gangling, with hair like a kitchen mop."
5,"""...a classic..""","Federico Garcia Lorca is perhaps the most important Spanish poet of the twentieth century. No less than seven of his works are included in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. Antologia Poetica is a ""classic"" as quoted in the guide."
1,FU2,"Don't buy this cd(I'm not saying it's a bad cd just a little piece of mind) if your a north american fan because it's an open hand smack in the face. Well, you know what I'm saying if you were at the debacle a couple of years ago with tanya and all plus we ended up with the bagman and his wonderful poems. I personally think she was told to do it or it had to do with a certain person's doing who lives in Baltimore. This is for European fans...why waste your money. I don't even have cdr left of his music...got rid of them all and cd's too. It's reminded too much of everything else just another headache."
3,The Best of Judy Garland,"I don't know if it's because this music was recorded so long ago or because the quality was lost in transition to the CD, but the orchestral accompanyment is poor. I love the songs but wish the quality were better."
5,You will feel like you are there!,"I love this album I remember my grandmother getting it for me for Christmas in 1991, it was the first CD I ever played in my first CD player on that Christmas morning. I love every track on it. I do however disagre with the previous reviewer regarding the placement of The only studio track ""Shining Star."" I beleive it was good to have in the middle it was sort of an ""intermission"" halfway through the album."
4,Do yourself the favor,"As I read the tragic story of Michael Hutchence written by his sister and mother (""Just A Man""), I am reviewing my INXS library, which normally I would probably never do.""Live Baby Live"" is the best cross section you can ever purchase for this band. Here @ Wembley, they are at their absolute peak of popularity, and the band (as always) is at their tightest.The studio versions of these songs will seem lame from this point on. You might as well throw them away, as I never listen to them anymore. Also, the corresponding video of this piece really drives home the point here. Great concert. I just wish the video had EXACTLY the same songs as the record. Some great nuggets are not there. Hutchence never was the same after that.Here's a question: Is it ""Live Baby Live"" (pr. L-EYE-VE -- a play on a lyric) or ""Live Baby Live"", like the lyric from ""New Sensation""? ""Love AND Peace"" Goodnight, Michael."
3,"A Great Concert, but not a must to own.","If you like live material and you like INXS, this CD is great. However, I don't think this CD offers much beyond recorded INXS. The content is heavily from Kick and X with a few older classics, and the sound is not much different from what was recorded in the studio.This isn't to say this is a terrible recording. If anything this album shows how great INXS really is. All too often, musical groups put out a great studio album only to be disappointing in concert. In fact, I think live performances are what define a group as great. Anyone could record an album in the studio with editting and multiple takes, but how many can play song after song flawlessly. This is what INXS does here and with enthusiasm.The biggest negative about this album, the inclusion of the track Shining Star, which is a studio track, and in the middle of the album no less."
2,"If size matters, look elsewhere.","Luckily for me I have a little wiggle room on size or I would be in trouble with this tarp. Nowhere in the description does it say 12' X 16' ""CUT size"", FINISHED SIZE 11'4"" X 15'6"",but it does on the packaging after you get it. Actual measurements 11'1/2"" X 15'7"". Nearly a foot short in width and 1/2 a foot in length, unacceptable! Grommets, although a few are smashed, are relatively evenly spaced and serviceable. I was sure that they had sent me the wrong tarp before I opened the box, when it felt like it and the box weighed less that my 8 x 10 tarp by it's self. Don't expect any long term use out of it, it is rather light material even though it claims to be heavy duty. I just hope it doesn't leak.Dave B"
3,Good book,"This was a good book, it had enough info to pass a teacher, so i think if u want info on this subject then read this book."
2,Packing,The box arrived soaking wet because one of the bottles opened and spilled all over.This is the third time this has happened. Love the product but bummed that I only get 5 for the price of 6
5,Shiney Beautiful Granite,"Method's Daily Granite (Granite and Stone Cleaner) is the best granite counter cleaner I've used. A way to sparkle up your granite on a daily basis! It's also biodegradable. Bravo!Susan in Santa Femethod Granite & Marble Spray, Case Pack, Six - 12 Ounce Bottles (72 Ounces)"
3,"Works well, smells bad","I like most Method products--some a lot. But this stuff leaves your kitchen (and even house) smelling like a bottle of cheap floral scented perfume exploded. It's NOT the sort of smell you associate with kitchens, food, and the like. If they made it unscented, or perhaps a light food-oriented scent (Apple or Citrus?), it would be fine. I won't be buying it again unless Method fixes the nasty smell."
5,Finally!,"I have tried SOOOO many granite cleaners. This is this first one that didn't leave a ""smeary film"" (can't think of a better way to describe it). Smells great - a little perfumy - but not overpowering - just a nice clean scent. LOVE IT!"
4,"So far, so good","My daughter got a scar on her face. She picked off a scab on her face and the resulting scar was bright red. I gave it some time, but the redness did not fade readily. I understand scars can fade over time, especially on kids; but since it was on her face, I did not want to take any chances. That it only might work was good enough for me. I've used Mederma regularly on her face for about a month and it is definitely faded, not so noticeable anymore.I also have a deep scar that is 35 years old right smack on the bridge of my nose. It's not fading any more than it has. I decided to try it on that and also a recent burn scar on my arm. The scar on my arm is looking better. It's still there but smooth and fading. The one on the bridge of my nose is deep. I think it looks better but it will be many months before I think I'll truly know. I'll be back to update at that time.For now, I think it does seem to help and really doesn't hurt new scar formation."
4,viva brooks-dunn,I went to Las Vegas in may 2005 and bought a cd from them... Within three months I had all their cd's.So...
4,High quality scissors.,"I had intended to buy a pair that came apart for cleaning purposes. These do not. They have several functions other than scissors which I will not likely use but as scissors, they are excellent. Very sharp and of a good weight and quality. I would recommend them to a friend."
5,wow!,"Wow! this scissor cut like a champ!! cut everything as if it were paper. The only downside is that it's a little short, but all in all, for the price, it's worth buying."
4,"Definitive, but not definitive...","This is a great book to have in your collection if you're a fan of blues music and history. By far, it's not the ONLY book out there. There are a number of notable artists this book is missing. Hopefully, future editions of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps. That being said, this is a very good reference just the same."
4,A good referance to accompany other reading or listening.,"The information provided in the biographical encyclopaedia is a good referance when reading other publications on the ""Blues"" or listening to recordings by a performer with whome you may not be familiar. Whilst the referances are not complete, it is nevertheless a source of sound information on numerous blues performers from the 1890's to the present. (I found I had a number of recordings in my collection made in the 1920's and 1930's by individuals not referenced in the book.)The book is a very good ""handbook"" to have by your side when you want to learn or simply recap on some details of an individual whose story you may be absorbing either through reading or listening."
1,Description and Photo not accurate,"The book pictured was a newer version of the book that I received, I received the older version with a different cover. The description stated that the book was used, however, it was not stated that the book was a used library book. It still had the library card holder on the inside cover, it had clear tape to reinforce the ouitside binding, as libraries will sometimes do, and it had ""New York Public Library"" stamped all over the inside of the book. The description stated it was in good condition, so I bought it for a friend who really loves the blues. I would have been ashamed and embarrassed to give her this book as a gift. Lesson learned."
1,Wow.,"I found this while perusing the bargain bin in hopes of finding a candidate for a ""Worst Movie Ever"" contest. Seriously. I wasn't disappointed.I honestly contemplated the possibility that I had a copy of a movie self-produced by bored college students. Perhaps one of them had slipped into the store, put a price tag on it and slyly placed it in with the real DVDs in hopes that someone would actually pay money for it. That someone was me.I won't get into the plot, because the Amazon description is accurate enough, as far as I can tell. I don't know, I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes. I couldn't take any more. My stomach hurt too much from laughing. I probably had a bigger movie budget in the cupholder in my car that I use for spare change. You know those ""dramatic reenactments"" they have on shows like America's Most Wanted? That's what this movie looks like. If you can find it for less than 8 bucks, pick it up. It's good for a laugh."
1,"UGH! Sorry, this just aint cuttin it","Aaron, my man. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? Why did you release an album with remixes? No offense, but this aint worth ur money. The good song is Let the Music Heal Your Soul, and u can d/l that from Napster, or Morpheus. Dont waste ur money on this, there's two (almost three) others to buy. get them!"
2,He sounds like a chipmunk!,"Dear custamur,He sounds like a chipmunk in this cd! Don't get it, or at least listen to it first!Your teen, EliseP.S. His cd's after his voice changes sounds good/great. I'd give that 5 stars"
2,A look back on history,"As many young people don't know, Surfin' USA was originally by the Beach Boys, who were totally hot! But Aaron Carter's voice sounds sooo funny! I remember this stage, it's when you couldn't tell if he was a boy or a girl between his high squeeky voice and his long hair!"
3,I respect all Caters but...,"Aaron's voice is to high. In a couple years he'll probably be worth listening to if you're still into that. Nick sings much better and looks it too.Peace, out. =)"
4,Waiting 4 aarons Party,"I am totally aarons number one fan, but i must be truthful that i dont like this album very much only because He didnt but much work into it so he recorded 1 or 2 songs but the rest are remixes. Just to let everyone know this cd only came out to fill the gap till Aarons Next album (aarons party (come get it)) Because his fans in 13 different countrys were wondering what happened to their crazy little party boy. this cd gave them something to listen to for a year be4 his next cd ame out. His first cd was recorded when he was 9 and his surfin USA was recorded 2 years later. Okay I hope this is Helpful"
5,Such A Thoughtful Gift,Just received this book for my birthday from a good friend. Loved the Girl Talk section and the Girl Food section. Susan's books are so creative and sentimental.
5,What a treat!,"This book is absolutely delightful! I started reading Susan's books about three years ago, and have followed her progress over the years. Her drawings are beautiful, and her writing style is friendly, sunshiney and full of vigor. The recipes in Girlfriends are very tasty, and health-conscious to boot. I was able to talk to Susan in person just last week at a book signing, and she is a beautiful, charming woman with incredible personal style. This book gives you reason to reflect on why you love your girlfriends, how you spend your time with them, and why it's so incredible to be a woman!"
2,I kept reading ...,"However, I do have a couple of ""irritations"" as I proceed through the book: #1 The Civil War was simply NOT all about slavery and #2 the term ""people of color"" continues to crop up--this is a modern, politically correct term (and though I have no objections to it in a modern context) but it has nothing to do with the terminolgy of the period. Every time I saw this term being used, I was jarred out of the time being described and into current terms and political correctness."
2,Maybe 2.5 stars...,"This is my first James Lee Burke novel, and I won't lie, it will probably be my last. Although there were some parts of this book that kept me interested, and as a history buff, I was happy with its historical accuracy, there were also many parts that dragged. I also feel that the author used massive amounts of description to make the book longer--there were way too many similes and metaphors packing the pages. To top it all off, I think the end was extremely anti-climactic. Was it a terrible book? No. But I wouldn't strongly recommend it to anyone, either."
4,Compelling,"James Lee Burke's ""White Doves at Morning"" is richly written, peopled with well-drawn characters and beautifully atmospheric.It is an historical novel set in the Louisiana bayou country during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Fictional characters mingle with true-life figures---abolitionists, slaves, overseers, white trash, secessionists, madams and war profiteers. And. we see the origin of Angola Prison.The dialogue is magnificent, the moods created extraordinary and the pace is rhythmic.I found it compelling reading that engaged me from start to finish.The white trash villains are particularly despicable. The central protagonists, while flawed, are easy to cheer for.JLB maintains his high standards."
2,Contrived Effort,"It's a contrived effort to deal with the impact of the Civil War on the inhabitants of one small town in Louisiana. The lead character is an ancestor of Burke's, but all the characters are wooden and stereotypical. The situatons are manipulated to allow Burke to ennoble his characters. The material was rich and could have been used more effectively if Burke had not tried so hard to make his ancestor, Willie Burke, a man of mixed mind about slavery and the causes of the war. The internal conflict seemed forced and somewhat stale. A little less omniscient narration and a great deal more dialogue would have made a fresher, cleaner novel and more realistic characters"
2,Very disappointing to a Robicheaux fan,"Had I not read with increasing delight most of the Dave Robicheaux stories (and other Burke offerings as well) and formed a deep appreciation for this real, flawed, heroic character, I might have kept reading. But after fifty pages of cardboard characters, improbable situations, and flagrant cliches, I was so disappointed in Burke that I tossed WHITE DOVES AT MORNING into the trash."
3,farfetched in spots,"I think the part of the book that makes the least sense is that Flower Jamison's father would ever acknowledge her as his daughter. In that time period white plantation owners just didn't do that. That she was able to become free and read and write without more problems from the people in the area is hard to accept as well.The depiction of the Civil War I think was accurate, it wasn't portrayed as at all glamorous. Some parts of it were good."
4,A good read,"Interesting story, characters delineated well. Recommend to those that are not historians but have an interest in Civil War fiction."
4,Burke Makes the Civil War Live Again,"James Lee Burke's WHITE DOVES AT MORNING is a historical novel that takes place in 1861. Don't groan at the idea of another Civil War novel this is the treatment of the subject of a master on his home ground of south Louisanna.Southern friends from different walks of live find adulthood in battle and love in an excellent excution of Burke's unique prose.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
3,Well worth reading,"This is a very well written novel, with lots of good Civil War history worked in, although I agree with one other reviewer here that at times the characters became ""preachy stereotypes,"" and another who said some characters' actions were unrealistic for the society, time period, etc. But, still, I greatly enjoyed it, and I found Willie Burke to be a very engaging character - I loved his smart remarks made almost always at the worst possible moments! I also like the complicated character of Flower's white father - I kept hoping he'd become a better person and was suprised more than once by his actions, good and bad. Flower is maybe a bit too good to be true, but I still felt myself hoping for her to get through all her ordeals and make a good life for herself. It's not a romantic look at the times, like Gone With The Wind, so don't expect that ""vibe,"" but it's got content that will make you sometimes wince, shudder, laugh or cry. Definitely worth the reading!"
5,AWESOME,"Like I really liked this book. I've read most all of James Lee Burke, and I think this was one of the best. could not put it down."
5,"Includes LP edit of ""I Want Your Love""","and that's the main reason this is such a good buy. Collectors looking for the radio edit shoud go elsewhere. The longer version of ""I Want Your Love"" is so much better. All the hits are here too."
3,"Not bad, but songs are too long","Admittedly, Disco was not one of the high points of R&B history, and much of the appeal is to people who have fond memories of the era and Europeans. Chic did put out some of the better records of this genre. Some of these songs are quite good, especially the atmospheric instrumental ""Savior Faire"" (not a disco tune, btw) which sounds like a perfect song to hear when you wake up on a sunny morning.However, even the good disco tunes here such as ""Everybody Dance,"" ""Dance Dance Dance"" (I've always roared with laughter at the ""Yowsah Yowsah Yowsah"" bit) ""I Want Your Love,"" ""Good Times,"" etc. are a bit much when heard in 7 to 8 minute disco mixes. This really makes even the good stuff monotonous. But taken in smaller doses, it's not that bad. Worth a listen."
4,Great album...,"If you're looking for a Chic greatest hits, you will miss 'You are beautiful' from 1984, because this compilation concentrates on the seventies, in which Chic was indeed at their best. However, all their 70s hits are featured here in their full length album version, and 'Everybody dance' is even included here as 12 inch mix.The CD inlay tells the whole Chic story and is very informative. However, it contains a fault in the track listing: 'Soup for one' last for only three minutes, the label states it is the full 7.58 version."
5,ONE SONG SAYS IT ALL!,"THOSE WERE ""GOOD TIMES""!BUY IT AND REMEMBER!BETTER YET, BUY IT AND INTRODUCE YOUR KIDS TO THE REAL DEAL ""BACK IN THE DAY""!"
4,Edwards and Rodgers are musical geniuses!,"The evolution of this genre of music goes like this: Ray Charles, James Brown, Sly Stone, Chic, Prince...Chic gets bad rap because their music was popular in the disco era. That just happens to be the type of music that would sell at that time. Put Edwards' bass lines up against any in the history of funk and you'd be hard pressed to find any better. Take away the strings and the hand claps and you wouldn't be able to date this music.This CD contains the extended mixes of most of the singles. For example, we're treated to a 8:13 version of Good Times and 8:30 version of Dance, Dance, Dance. Don't worry, the groove never gets old.Feeling nostalgic for the ""Good Times""? Pick this (or any Chic CD, for that matter) and start dancing. Now, when are the record decision-makers going to decide to release a CD version of Nile Rodger's ""Adventures in the Land of the Good Groove""?!?"
2,Damaged Goods,"I wasn't happy to receive this CD from this company. They printed my address and underneath that was "" or current residence"". Oh, it gets better! The CD was cracked on the front as well as the back and it wasn't a used! So, I was not pleased when I saw it. However, the CD itself wasn't scratched and the music was really awesome. It's a rare CD and the price for it was perfect. I think they should've packaged it a little better and NOT print current residence. Chic's CD should be treated with style not like a piece of junk mail."
4,Very nice looking.,I ordered 3 sets of these to be nameplates for my candle business. The description said that they came with a gold pen but mine had a black one which is fine. They are very easy to write on and just as easy to reuse. Just wash them off with a soapy sponge and they are ready to use again.
5,Perfect!,"Very pleased, the product met my expectations and shipped super fast even at Christmas time! Thank you for excellent service!!! Fyi the picture shows more then 4 but the pkg only has 4"
2,Ink pens dried out,"Got 2 sets of this as a gift and really like the place cards for name place and identifying foods at a potluck. However was very disappointed that the ink pens dried out after a month and used only once. Can't find replacement pens. Contacted vendor, but doesn't sell just the pens."
4,"Fascinating story, easy read","First off, I will concede the point others have made that the author's style isn't exactly gripping. He doesn't have the ""storyteller"" touch to his writing, but nevertheless, this book is still an easy read.The story of the Fitz is incredible and the author does an excellent job covering all the theories and evidence surrounding the sinking, as well as outlining the many questions that are still unanswered. It's an incredible story and a good read."
4,"Excellent book, but.....","I feel the book was excellent in telling the story of the wreckand investigation but as another reviewer said, where's the maps?Since I am not from the Great Lakes area I would have liked tohave a map(s) of the lakes, the shipping routes, the shoals, the route the Fitz traveled, and the area where it sank. I would also have liked to have some drawings of the Fitz showing the hatches, etc. so I could better understand the things that came out in the investigation. A few pictures would also have been great (but not absolutely necessary) as the author talked about all the pictures that have been taken. I give the writing a 5 but overall a 4 because of the lack of maps and pictures."
2,old beer,"I've read two books on the loss of the Fitzgerald: ""Gales of November"" published many years ago and now this one. With similar faults, both have failed. Each has lost an opportunity to tell a compelling tale. Schumacher's writing is stale and flat, using hackneyed conceits that just make me groan and squirm with discomfort. The book's organization is disjointed, poorly laid out in its narrative. I note as I read how many chances to make a narrative rich with detail were missed and how an awkward phrase could instead have been said with grace.With ""Gales of November"" full of factual error (e.g. confuses longitude and latitude) and poorly imagined, I am mystified why the author and publisher thought they had anything better to offer this time.This ship and its tragedy remain without the skilled and able storyteller it needs."
1,Disappointed!,I just recieved the Italian horn.....in the listing it stated it was .75 (3/4) inch long. I foolished assumed the horn itself was that long but that wasn't the case. The horn is .5 (1/2) inch and the ring adds the other quarter inch. Oh well....live and learn.
4,Great account of the WWI air war.,"For anyone interested in the air war of WWI, I have to recommend ""Falcons of France."" A wonderful read from the first page on. All the drama of friends, combat, capture and escape are in it. And when your done with ""Falcons of France,"" you must read ""Fighting the Flying Circus"" by Eddie Rickenbacker. The two books parallel each other until the mid point and then go off in two directions. I got a better understanding of ""Fighting the Flying Circus"" after reading ""Falcons of France."" I highly recomend ""Falcons of France."""
3,"Fine, bur a bit fragile.","This item worked as advertised and was easy to use and mount to the wall. Perfect form factor for a small home or office installation. I did, however, manage to crack the plastic on it while working with it so the face plate basically pops off the mounting bracket. Doesn't stop it from working and it gets walled up in a basement closet anyway so not a huge deal, but kind of annoying that it snapped that easily."
2,Not a feedthrough panel,"This product is not titled correctly. This patch panel is not a feedthrough. A Feedthrough panel has RJ-45 ports on both sides, this does not. This product has RJ-45 ports on the front side and punch downs on the other side. On the Tripp Lite site, this product is described correctly as ""12-Port Cat6 Wall-Mount Vertical 110 Patch Panel""."
4,Robert Bardley's Blackwater Surprise ROCK live.,"Although these songs were released on their first album, these live performances take the songs to a new emotional (and rocking) level. The guiitar work on the songs with Audley Freed (of the Black Crowes) is awesome. This is a must have."
2,Read the fine print,A lesson learned to pay attention to dimensions. This bench appeared to be much larger than it was. I must have received a defective item as all of the pegs easily slipped into the slots instead of being able to tap them in with the hammer. The threaded pegs also fell easily into the slots instead of being able to tighten them with the screw driver. The bottom tray was cracked as well. It is an ok toy. Make sure you compare it with others that are similar to get the best item.
3,It hits and misses,"This book was nice mainly for the consolidated information about the history of the Warcraft setting. I was pleased to find all of this data in an easy to read format and all in one place.The actual mechanics, however could use some work. The paladin in particular felt like a ""phoned-in"" effort. The book also would have done better with a major reworking of d20, or even a different system all-together. The normal Deeindee magic system feels kind of tacked-on and many of the class defining tricks are absent or highly modified. The Warlock class, for example could have actually mentioned the various demons used by Warlocks in the World of Warcraft."
5,excellent,Jerry Lee is still the killer. His can still make you want to get up and dance. He is the leader of the band and can Rock and Roll even better than before. He has aged with grace and has a very sexy sound. I love his music.
1,waiting,"The album, ""Last Man Standing"" is a 2 CD set. The second CD doesn't play and is faulty. I've contacted the seller, but at this point haven't heard back from him."
1,Learning Organization Pablum,"If you are looking for practical, hard hitting insight and knowledge you can use as a practising manager, totally BYPASS this wordy, ivory tower compendium of theoretical jargon."
3,"Good read, albeit dry","I bought this book for use in a class at the University of Michigan (SI 422). While many of the topics presented and discussed are great, and very interesting, the book fails to be engaging by any means. The language is very dry and ends up being a difficult read. I would not recommend this book as a casual read of any sort."
4,communities of practice,This is a good resource for understanding organization and professional environments and the interactions that take place within these environments.
2,Poor audio version of a great movie.,"Having grown up listening to a 60 minute audio tape of Star Wars over and over, I expected the CD of Episode 1 purchased for my son's 6th birthday to be of similar quality. I was sorely disappointed with length, quality and lack of significant movie dialog. The story is severly edited, probably less than one-half hour, and almost all narration with little in the way of sounds and dialog from the movie. Hopefully, someone will come out with a better audio version because this one leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Understated elegance,"I bought this necklace to give as a Christmas gift and I'm so glad that I did. This is very impressive looking piece of jewelry. Excellent color and weight, it's just right for a tween girl, or for anyone who likes gold [jewerly] that has some bling but is just a little conservative. Great deal!"
4,Preparation for Post Office Clerk,"Tipical govermant stuff, kinda dry but looked like it would help, turns out I went another direction with my life."
4,How to Use a Computerized Telescope,This is a very clearly-written book and excellent for beginners. It breaks down the various topics of using a computerized telescope into manageable chapters.
1,save your money,"Great movie, but don't waste your money on this version. I bought the new VHS tape and the quality is so bad that it is hardly watchable. The DVD is from the same company, so I am sure they are both ripoffs. Shame. I think they recorded it in a movie theater using a hand held camcorder."
5,LET THE DRAMA UNFOLD...,"One could not predict the turn of events nor the outcome of this tale. ""Shades of Retribution"" lures you in so deeply that you become the proverbial ""fly on the wall"" and the story soon becomes your own. Chandra leaves just enough unsaid to leave you wanting to read even more about these characters - their past and their future. I would especially love to see their stories unfold on the big screen. This is a tremendous debut effort by Ms. Adams. I can't wait to see what she'll give us next!"
4,Black women take action,"Shades of Retribution is about how strong black women deal with what seems to be a trend among black men who are more interested in white women. Hmmm. What to do about that? How to get them back on track, celebrating and loving good black women, is the drama in this book."
4,Works as advertised,Works well - I am not totally thrilled with the picture from the split/combine - but it works better than what I had and that is a great improvement.
5,cant get enough of this machine,"i have this Brother sewing machine already. i bought the XR-65 model new about 5-6 years ago. at that time, it didnt come with a quilting table. it has been USED A LOT by my daughter and i almost every day as we both sew for the family and create all types of clothing articles, plus do small repair jobs occasionally for the public. i absolutely love it! it has done such a wonderful job and since Brother is not making the XR-65 model any more, as far as i know, i must have another one for back-up. i have just ordered the model XR-65T. my Brother machine has outsewn all the singer machines ive had in the past and ive had several. i always thought ""nothing but a Singer"" however this machine set me straight. these, as NEW, will soon be gone but, if we are lucky, Brother will bring them back again. (i dont see that happening, tho'). those of us who have and love this machine will be sad to never see it New again."
2,TROUBLEMAKER,"I have never had so much trou ble with a sewing machine. To begin with, i cannot get the bobbin to wind smoothly if the bobbin thread doesnt wind smoothly you will encounter jams Also the handle of the machine sits over the thread spool It has a drop in bobbin which i love, but it is hard to thread it and keep it in place. It has a see through cover, a cheap piece of plastic that came off and was instantly lost! It is too lightweight and can fall over while you are sewing i am used to being able to open the front of the machine (where you thread it) but you have to get a screw driver to open it. Thus to clean it of lint etc you have to stop everything. maybe these have been discontinued..if so you can see why"
5,brother sewing machine xrt-65,"I have had this maching for about 5 yrs. I have been sewing like a fool with it for two years.I have never had any issues and this machine will stand the test of time. Very easy to use, very easy to thread etc."
3,Pretty good book,"This is pretty good. I received it as a gift from a friend. Unfortunately, it is a bit unrealistic toward the reasons most people seek jobs -- they need to pay their bills.Paying the bills is the priority; finding your dream job is not. This job isn't going to work if you don't have a job, and need to take on whatever you can find to pay the bills (i.e., a temp job, or a Walmart job, or whatever).A book like this only works if you have a job and can afford to take the time to plan ahead so you can quit your job for a better one. It is a good planning resource, but would be better if it was more realistic."
4,Undisputed champ...,"This book has been around forever because it is one of the best books to help you discover what you should be doing. It takes a holistic approach to carefully examining your life and your career. However, if you already know what you want, this book might be overkill.If you are currently looking for a specific position and want to jump start your job search, I highly recommend a small guide that was recommended to me, titled CONFESSIONS OF A HEADHUNTER (www.lulu.com/dmc) It took only a half hour to read, but it's packed with unusual ideas and it opened my eyes to techniques recruiters use to find the better jobs that rarely get advertised."
1,Time for this horse to head to pasture . . .,"I am loathe to put down such a prolific author, but Bolles reminds me of those textbook writers who make money off poor college students year after year by simply moving around a chapter or two and calling it the ""new and improved edition.""Bolles was definitely ahead of his time at one point and he has clearly had some great PR people behind him, but this book really isn't that different from last year's version or the year before that. I think it is time to put this horse to rest and for the author to maybe find something else to write about? If you are still determined to pick up one of the parachute books, go to Amazon's used section or hit a garage sale, there will likely be plenty of copies there."
3,Useful but very time consuming,"I think after 30 years of being in print this book is starting to get a bit dated. While I found many of the exercises to be very beneficial, I also found the book to be extremely time consuming and not as practical for today's fast paced world.A small workbook that I found to be much more beneficial was ""10 Insider Secrets: Career Transition Workshop"" by Todd Bermont. That book really helped me net it out to figure out what I wanted to do and it also helped me with putting together a game plan to get the job.As for Parachute, my recommendation is to skip to the Flower Exercise as I found that to be the most useful part of the book. If you do that exercise there is not much need to read hundreds of pages of dated material."
2,Not Worth the Money,This book may be worth while for hobbists but professionals shouldn't waste their money. There's nothing original in it. I was very disappointed.
5,Very useful information,This book was full of actual information and helpful guidelines instead of the usual cliche's and generalizations that make up so many other how-to books. It sealed my interest in becoming an owner of a boarding kennel. The author's flexible yet common sense attitude toward his business is inspiring. The animal anecdotes made me laugh and some made me cry. I hope to be as firm yet compassionate as the author in my future business. Does he do seminars?
1,"Oh, no, not another one. . .","This is another book I wrote for NASA, not for the University of Michigan, as is claimed. The University of Michigan is ripping you off if you buy this. It is available online for free at the NASA Headquarters History Office website. Neither the author nor the original publisher sees any of the money you pay for it. This is at best unethical. Caveat emptor!"
5,A Constant Companion for Years to Come,"I bought this bag at an Army-Navy store in Chicago, and have been using it regularly ever since. After 8 years, the strap finally gave out, so I'm here to buy another. This bag is certainly worth the price. My favorite feature is the expandable main compartment. If you don't have a lot of items to carry, you can zip the bag to about half its carrying capacity. It makes a great book bag, grocery bag, day pack, etc. It's also machine washable and very durable."
5,Great quality,"This bag is very black, despite what you see in the photos. It is made of a nice quality canvas material and the stitching is great. I can see how the plastic zipper used to expand the bag could break. If that happens I will bring it up to the local seamstress chick to put a better quality metal zipper on it. Even if that costs $15, the bag is still worth it to me. It's hard to find a quality bag under $50.I like the idea of a previous reviewer to change the closing tabs to metal clasps and may look into that =)"
2,Short strap,this is good quality but for me the strap was way too short. It fits too much like a purse for the average size man.
2,Heed the zipper warnings,"I read the other reviews of this product and knew the expanding zipper might be a problem, but I didn't imagine how much. First, the bag didn't arrive when I was told it would, and dates kept changing so that started my frustrations.When I got the bag I noticed what everyone else said about the shoulder strap. I am only 5'1"" so for me it isn't a problem, but I can't imagine this bag being comfortable on anyone who is taller than me.I often have thick law books to carry with my laptop so I figured I would have the expanding zipper open most of them time...but I could fit it all with the zipper closed! That would be fine except for the way it is deigned the strap broke the plastic expanding zipper within a week. Now it is always stuck on open. Very frustrating.On the positive, the pockets in the front are great and the canvas is thick and durable."
4,good quality,"this is a very sturdy bag and the material is very strong. the only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because the style has a casual/worn look to it. but thats just me, i think i was expecting a more professional/briefcase look than a casual/bookbag look. its casual look is very nice looking though, i know it will last a very long time."
3,"much that is good, much that is frustrating","There is much to like in this film, many scenes that fascinate and enchant--most notably, a very amusing sequence about an ineffectual Devil whose attempts to claim a soul earn him nothing but jeers. However, much about the film is obscure, and this hindered my enjoyment--for example, the time shifting has no purpose that I could discern. Most frustratingly, the film is confusing as to what is happening to the central character--Is he being led into temptation, or is he the innocent victim of a diabolic trick? Several scenes suggest the former, but he has little to do with the final crisis.--and so the point of the story is unclear. In brief: There is quite enough good about this film to make it worth seeing, but it is not a satisfying experience."
4,lovely to see beauty brought to the complexities of life,AND it's a DAVID BOWIE project so it must be good. tata
2,Frustrating,"Unfortunately the abundance of use-free filler left me with a sour taste and doubt about the author's credibility. An example would be the page and a half spent on the importance of having a lot of pencils and paper. Writers don't generally need to be told this.By and large I found the inset comments from other comics writers more helpful than the author's content, (though some of it is lifted directly from other books.)I would not recommend this book."
2,Keep It Simple,I bought a transmitter for my IPod mini about two years ago. It had four stations and was very simple and easy to use and it worked great!! It seems that simple is no longer an option and I bought this Tunebase FM Transmitter for a friend's IPod Nano and it has a bunch of options for stations and puts your ipod up high and seems very luxurious.. But it stinks!! i can never find a station without static and its a pain to have look through 100 stations. I am returning the product and will look for something better
4,Trust me -- Do NOT buy an FM Transmitter,"I live in San Jose -- a big city with over a million people and a TON of radio stations -- and I could not get decent reception AT ALL. I had to return it, as it was uselessDo yourself a favor and go to a Car Stereo stop. They are all over the place. Tell them you want to use your iPOD with your existing car stereo. They have a product that goes in between your antenna and your stereo, with a cable that connects to your iPOD. It's fantastic! Your iPOD gets changed, you get AWESOME sound, and it only costs about $120 fully installed and ready to go. Sure, it costs more than an FM Transmitter, but TRUST ME, you will NEVER get a good, clear signal with an FM Transmitter."
1,Operations Support Analyst,This is an excellent item for anyone on-the-go who has an iPOD Nano. No longer do you need to carry those cumbersome CD's around or get distracted while driving when a CD ends and you need a new one. Why pay the big bucks for a CD changer & player when all you need is this & an iPod Nano?
2,The weak link,"I chose the Belkin Tunebase because reviews rated its sound quality as the best of the bunch. I don't dispute that, but it's by no means great. Think typical FM quality minus 25%. Every ""S"" or high-treble ting is replaced by static. So more like 'FM as your driving out of the station's range' quality. And that's once you scour every frequency, one-by-one for the clearest. I tried this with factory and expensive aftemarket car stereos in a variety of environments and was consistently disappointed. But to clarify, I'm disappointed in the technology as a whole, not just the brand. Belkin's product has a great design and good user interface, but it's a half-cocked solution if sound quality is remotely important to you."
1,Item does not work with First Generation iPOD,"The Belkin TuneBase FM Transmitter for iPod nano 1G, 2G (Black) does NOT work with the first generation iPODs. I found this out the hard way via a technical support call to Belkin after I bought this item as a gift to my wife. I assume the reference to 1G in this listing is a typo."
3,"Belkin TuneBase FM Transmitter for iPod 1G, 2G","Belkin TuneBase FM Transmitter for iPod nano 1G, 2G (Black)Very easy to use, however some of the FM channels had some static in the cars where I used it. I liked the wide number of FM stations that could be used. The major problem was that the base of the iPod did not fit the connector at the bottom of the TuneBase. The plastic casing that surrounds the bottom portion of the iPod had to be cut so that the iPod would fit onto the connector. Once that was done, the TuneBase worked as it was designed."
2,doesn't work that well,"the transmitter didn't work as advertised, perhaps because the FM stations are pretty full in my area, but nonetheless, it didn't work for me."
3,No better than Foghat-Live,"Just received this today and although a very good King Biscuit performance, it's not better than Foghat-Live as others profess. Actually the only reason I got it was for Driving Wheel and Night Shift. These two cuts should have been on the original Live and it would be almost perfect. The omission of those two songs make it incomplete. That being said, I think Foghat-Live has superior perfomances. This disc is a plain jane performance with no production, which is exactly what you would expect from a King Biscuit recording. The performances themselves are very good, so if you only care about that this is a fine disc."
3,small and flimsy,"I knew the dimensions, and still it is small and flimsy, there really isn't anything holding it together that will keep it together. The top gate is nice and allows me to see my cat whine when she is in the crate for transport. But it's still flimsy. Made to cheaply to be graded a good product. And yes the packing was atrocious too."
3,High Quality,"It was smaller than I hoped, but since the dimensions were included with the description, that was my fault. The top door, which is very helpful with putting a cat in the carrier, is hard to open and close, which is why I only gave it a 3 star rating."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this carrier because my cats don't always want to come out. I found the door on top was too small to remove my adult cats and the door on the front opens in a way that partially blocks the opening, making it difficult to reach in and bring my cats out. Otherwise it is very sturdily built and if you have a small animal it would be OK."
4,Cat Carrier,The open top on this carrier is nice. It's comforting to both me and the cat to be able to see each other!
4,We're goin' ballin' til half past three,"The Clovers were one of the top R&B vocal groups of the 1950s. They recorded several top 10 R&B hits, most of which are included here. The Clovers had a more ""raunchy"" sound than most groups. They could even make an innocent song like ""Blue Velvet"" sound a little dirty. But most of their songs weren't as innocent as that one. The main subjects of their songs were booze and women. There are a lot of great songs here, and fans of '50s R&B should enjoy it."
2,Not what I expected,"The 'chrome' cosmix spinner came yesterday. I wanted it for a gift. It looks so shiny and beautiful in the picture. Unfortunately it didn't appear that way when it came. It looks like it's stamped out of cheap metal. It's not shiney and polished looking and it certainly doesn't appear to have a chrome finish. And the edges are rough. It looks like something that would quickly rust. On top of that it is advertised for $21 something and instead I was charged more than $34 for it. It's going back!Oh, and I don't know why the description for this product says that it's made out of acrylic????"
2,Where is the Engineer gear?,"Incredible photos...but if you're looking for stuff on the 326th Airborne Engineers, it's not given much attention in this book, even though there's a chapter entitled: Troop Carrier and Airborne Engineers. Still waiting for someone to compile a likeminded work on strictly the 326th Engineers! Mark Bando, are you reading this???"
4,Review of Martha & Skits,"Martha, a mature dog, is first amused and later annoyed by Skits a new puppy. It is fun to watch the relationship between wise Martha and spazzy Skits develop past annoyance and on to motherly concern. The book made me hungry for more Martha stories, especially the origin story, which explains how Martha's first taste of alphabet soup gave her the power of human speech.The artwork makes me think of perennial New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast, with its amusing, perplexed-looking people."
3,Back to the Stand-Along Alex Cross Novel,"I enjoy the stand-along Alex Cross novels most. This one finally returns to that plan. While I felt a bait-and-switch at the end, this book stands alone. Enjoy John Sampson in this book, as he disappears from most of the next couple."
3,Half book is very good,"The first half of the book is a page turner, the way the Three Blind Mice made the assaults are extremely well written, the way that Alex Cross makes all the investigations is quite good, but the other half, the love story with Jamilla, the illness of Nana Mama and the story of the marbles in the jar is boring and nonsense, in that part the book goes so many times out of the story that you almost forget it, maybe if JP didn't write all of these the book would be with less pages but will be a thriller from the first page to the last, by the way, as many books you can just skip the epilogue."
3,Cotton Candy - Good Without Substance,"The story moves rapidly. It is laced with violence and death, spiced with thought provoking sermons about capturing family moments and sprinkled with not so subtle jabs at the business of war and some thereby employed.If you need Spock-like logical characters, this tale is not for you. Patterson's Detective Cross will annoy you when he repeatedly puts himself in harm's way - sometimes alone. Likely equally annoying will be the fact the Patterson does not slow the plot by taking time to explain how Detective Cross and his partner John Sampson are able to spend weeks solving crime(s) with no apparent connection to the District of Columbia - their employer.Read for entertainment, not to escape the ugliness that life brings to some."
3,Not his best but not as bad as some are saying.,"Four Blind Mice is not one of my favorites in the Alex Cross series. However, it is still an interesting read. For fans of the series, the book will appeal more to you just to catch up on Alex's life and new love. This time the killers are three ex-Army contract killers who are hired by another to frame ex-soldiers for murder. Cross gets involved when his partner/best friend John Sampson asks for him to help out an old Army buddy who is on death row in North Carolina. If you are a fan of the series you won't want to miss this one. However, if you have never read Patterson's Cross series try Kiss the Girls or Along Came A Spider before jumping into this one."
3,PROBABLY COULD SPEND YOUR TIME BETTER,"While not a complete flop, there are certainly better books in this genre out there that certainly deserve your time more than this one. Silly sex, silly violence and little story tends to make you want to yawn more than turn a page. This is actually a good author so I was rather surprised at this offering. Wonder where the publisher is in all this mix. You would think, they, the publisher, would want to protect a well selling author and be honest enough with him when his work is not up to expected standards. On the other hand, it did not really injury me to read this thing and I suppose if you have a couple of evenings to kill, it is not all that bad. I would certainly check this one out of the library rather than plunking down cold cash."
2,Like putting a puzzle together with an exacto knife......,"James Patterson, it seems, has let the ball drop for a bit with this novel. This tale involves old Army friends, people in high places and a lot of unlikely possibilities that just never gel into a rich full story. It feels like putting a puzzle together but you have to take an exacto knife out to get the pieces to really fit, and then the picture is just all wrong.There are so many bad guys that you have to wonder how the Army could have functioned at all, and the only real decent guy from the Army seems to be the one facing the death penalty. There are not enough portions of reality to hold the book together. This is definitely not one Patterson's better works."
1,Finished in one day is not always a compliment,"I've read all the Alex Cross series, so I obviously was looking forward to the latest. If I could have had a choice on getting the lastest sooner, or wait another year for a book that was actually worth reading, I would have rather wait another year.The story plot was one of the most predictable reads I have ever read. The characters where predictable and boring. If I had to read one more time about what Alex thought of his girlfriend's kisses, I think I would have screamed. The trip to the jail to ask advice from death row inmates. . .I can't imagine what Patterson was thinking when he put out this book, but I can say, even though I've read all the other Cross novels, I'm not anxious for the next."
5,Could not put it down,"Started the book on my 1-hr bus+rail ride to work. By the time I walked out of the rail station I already had gone thru over 100 pages. By the time I was back home I was halfway thru the book. I read nonstop until I finished it. Cross in his finest form.I was joking to my wife that Patterson needs to either add 200 pages to his books or add some kind of break between parts of the book so we can actually consider reading it in more than one day. I could have finished the book in one sitting had I decided to read it on a Saturday instead of on a work day. This has been true of all of his books I have read, including the ones without Cross.I am of course eagerly awaiting the next one."
1,1 star for a quick read...,"That it can be read in a few hours is the best thing I can say about this book. Reads more like a rough draft or outline than a complete novel. Cardboard characters, cursory plot development and unimaginative prose are among the flaws. A total waste of an afternoon."
2,What a waste!,"James Patterson phoned in ""Four Blind Mice""---if, in fact, he actually bothered to write any of this uninspired, preposterous, formulaic, cookie-cutter thriller.The villains in this Alex Cross novel are unrealistic cartoonish parodies---the plot predictable, simplistic, unbelievable and all too pat.The love interest for Dr. Cross a painfully embarrassing distraction that fails to move the plot along and is nearly unreadable.Loose ends abounded.It is hard to believe this is the same author who gave us such absorbing, compelling and rousing fiction as: ""The Midnight Club,"" ""Black Market"", ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", ""Cat and Mouse"" and the Edgar winning ""Thomas Berryman Number.""On the plus side, John Sampson is a spectacular supporting character. And, Mr. Patterson's short chapter, fast-paced writing style makes for a fast read.Too many trees died for this book."
2,Predictable And Better Left Unread,"Why Mr. Patterson believed that the world needed yet ANOTHER novel about ""crazed"" 'Nam veterans and the atrocities of the war, that we should have healed from long ago if not for these rehashes, is beyond my understanding. The memory of those who served honorably is continually tarnished by these ""sensational"" nightmare novels.I gave it two stars because the characters of the detectives and their families are so very well done.The rest should have remained in Mr. Patterson's head."
1,"Makes Me Fear for the ""Public""","How did this guy ever get on top? If the people who praise this writer ever read, Connelly, Hunter, Sanford etc. they would have a different perspective. His writing is so childish as to be embarrassing. He must have mentioned the size of the porterhouses they were eating 5 times. And who ever heard of being able to ""hug"" an inmate let alone one on death row? This may seem to be nitpicking but it is just an example of the tenor in whole book. Write for adults for god`s sake."
1,Save your money,That this author can sell books shows just how far we have fallen in the literary world. Poor plot. Poor characterizations. Poor everything. He should take up garbage hauling as he assuredly knows how to produce it.
3,"Was lent the book, but will read another!","Reading late at night with a single bulb burning when the crazies start growling Vietnamese to their victims nearly gave me a heart attack. Whoo! Most of this is seriously well-written and zippy-quick. He soooo needs to get over writing romantic bits. I could not get in to these two tough-guys exploring their love lives. James, get a dame (Sandra Brown?) to ghost-write the sex stuff - I'm not buyin' it!"
4,"Casual read, but worth the money","I enjoyed this book as a casual read. I've been through the entire Patterson genre and while this isn't top on my list, it's still good and worth the money.Also recommended: The Da Vinci Code, Bark of the Dogwood, Life of Pi"
1,Is this a novel or an outline?,"This is the first Patterson book I've read, and my impression of him hasn't changed. His plots are predictable (a judgment made after seeing Kiss The Girls and Along Came A Spider films) and lacks suspense. The way the story is written is like a proposal, there's not much detail and the way he portrays African Americans is very stereotypical, right down the food they eat. Although he has a noble attempt to deviate from the who is the killer plotline (we know who did the murders in the 2nd chapter), you'll know it's something they did in the past and someone is trying to erase it plotline. After reading Nelson Demille and other authors that dabbled in military conspiracies, I've made a conclusion that Patterson should not have strayed into this genre."
5,Great book,I haven't read in 25yrs since I pickling first james patterson book in Oct2012 I. Can't stop reading his books
2,The First 100 pages...,"just flew by. Whether that is a good thing or not I'm not sure. This was my first James Patterson book, and I'm thinking I may have picked the wrong one. I really didn't care about the personal side of the characters; I thought it was distracting from the story.As far as the story went, it moved along but for me fell apart at the end. I not sure I'll ever read James Patterson again based on this book."
3,Timeline doesn't work,"I like James Patterson, and I like Alex Cross. This book isn't bad, but one thing that really throws it all off balance is John Sampson. he's 42 or so. The book was written in 2002. He was supposed to have served 2 tours in Vietnam, during the war. How old was he supposed to be? The war was a wrap by 1975. In 1972, 30 years before this book was written, and going with Sampson being 42, he would have been 12. Seems a bit. Are we to buy that he served 2 combat tours, or any kind of tour, before he was 15? I don't know about you, but no atter how big and strong Sampson is, that doesn't work for me."
4,Unstoppable Cross,"Good book, love all of the ""Cross"" theme books. Nice change of pace to see Samson in the spotlight, and I could do without Jamilla. I think Patterson, as usual, does an excellent job putting a suspenseful, spin tingling thriller on the pages everytime he writes about Alex Cross. I was surprised with the outcome of Cross vs. special forces veterans. Good book, certainly worth reading"
4,Four Blind Mice,"Suspenseful, could not put the book down. I really did not know how it was going to end. Excellent book."
3,"Good, but with some inconsistencies",I picked this up at an airport before an international flight. I've read a few Patterson books recently. This was not quite as good as some of the others. Part of the problem might have been me reading them out of chronological order (this is another Alex Cross book). I didn't really care for the ending. There also seemed to be some technical and story inconsistencies.
4,Always a goody with Patterson,"Another good Alex Cross. Partner Sampson comes alive in this thriller. Great villans and a good story line had me through this one quickly. Alex, ready to pack it in, keeps in the game til the end."
2,Why the Large Print?,"I don't understand. Why the large print? Isn't it supposed to be an advanced adult book? I mean, even me, an 11 year old skimmed through and read it. The chapters are only like, 2-4 pages long. When I saw the advertisement on TV, it looked suspensful, thrilling, and reminded me of Law & Order: SVU or Criminal Intent. I guess not. But it's not a total waste. I really don't know how to specifically explain this book."
2,"A little character, please.","One or two Patterson novels and you have Patterson's (or whoever really did write this stuff) universe of characters. If this is your first Patterson book, it's not bad. If it's your third, you will know most of it before your crack the cover. If it's your fifth, you will sleep through the last half."
3,Definitely not upto Patterson's best,"I was very excited to get this novel, as I have loved much of his earlier work. It was okay I felt, just not the typical twists, and turns that I expect from a Patterson novel. It almost seemed as though he may have had contractual obligations to fulfill, rather than the superior substance that I have come to love."
1,Not even worth finishing,"Has Patterson now reverted to publishing only for dollars? Sadly, I think so. The character development is weak, the plot absurd. I can think of nothing positive to say about this effort."
5,Keeps the thriller intriguing.,Mr. Patterson keeps you interested from the start to the end of the story. He builds the story in a way that keeps you wanting more. I am a new fan of Alex Cross. A must read for those who are following the series.
2,Condition of the book was not as described,"Very good book! However, the condition of the book was not as described. The main reason I purchased this book was because of the rating was ""like new"". The actual condition of the book was not that great. There was food particles inside of the book as well as stains throughout the pages. It appears that someone read it while reading chocolate."
2,Four blind mice,Fast read xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx ghost ghost ghost chef f2f chin chin chin f2f chin chin
1,My first and last James Patterson book,"If I was still a thirteen year old child, I might have liked this book, but those days are long over and so was this book. It read like a dime store novel. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was too predictable. This was my first James Patterson novel and my last. I wouldn't waste my money."
3,"Good, but not great","James Patterson has a great way of telling a story. However, on this book, it seemed like he forced the story. Several times throughout the book (especially the first half) he repeats himself when referring to details. What I loved most about ""Four Blind Mice"" is that it focuses on Sampson. Sampson has taken a back seat the last few novels. It was about time to get an indepth look at this valuable character. As far as intensity, this book is a page turner like all Patterson novels. VERY INTENSE! Sad to read Patterson say that this may be the last Cross novel. If it is, he has a nice wrap up at the end. Good storytelling. Good plot. Just not great. You will enjoy though."
3,Not his best,It would seem Mr. Patterson is tired of our old friend Alex Cross - that or he is merely fulfilling his contractual obligation with his publisher. The chapters are only a page or two long each and widely spaced out making for a quick read. Boring plot - but even at Patterson's worst he is still better than many. The killers are not fleshed out nor is their reason for killing; Cross's long-time (but finished) love affair with the Sojourner Truth principal is barely mentioned; Nana holds an unusually large piece of the action - really not all that suspenseful. I would buy it used or in paperback if you can stand to wait.
2,Patterson Needs to go Back to the Drawing Board,"James Patterson steals a page from fellow bestselling author [author:John Grisham|721], with a ex army member wrongfully accused of murder. Alex Cross faces off against four murderous army specialist. There was something about the novel that just fell flat. Patterson's prose can sometimes be too simple and I'm afraid this is one of those times."
3,Couldn't get into this one...,"Don't quite understand why I couldn't get into Patterson's Four Blind Mice. It certainly has the action of the other Alex Cross novels I've read, but I didn't feel the connect with the characters that I usually do. Even the romance felt slightly off-kilter. Although I welcomed a relationship for Cross' buddy, John Sampson, and found it both a surprise and refreshing. Perhaps it's the military or Viet Nam era theme of the book that put me off. Or the disjointedness of the relationships. I know it bothers me that Cross himself never mentions or thinks of Little Alex's mother, and I'm constantly wondering why. Oh well, Four Blind Mice is good to read once. Those who like military action will probably love it. Still a fan."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Four Blind Mice is my least favorite Alex Cross novel. While I enjoy the series and loved the extra focus on Alex's partner Samson, the mystery was focused on the military. While this is of interest to many, it holds no entertainment value for me. Alex's girlfriend, Jamilla, didn't make things any better. Short chapters and Patterson's classic fast-paced style were the only thing that helped me get through this book. Probably great for most fans of the series, but a miss for me."
3,John Sampson in spotlight,Thisis a change of pace in that John Sampson plays a much bigger role in this novel in fact the framed up execution of one of Sampsons friends starts the investigation. Atrio of assassins is killing people framing the real target who then is executed. The story is well done and Sampsons bigger role adds some freshness. As usual the romantic elements are not well done and take up too much space
1,A High School Writing Effort,"I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read. I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability. The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it. As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting. I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable."
2,Downer of a Climax,"Four Blind Mice is the first James Patterson novel that I have read. I saw both Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider on DVD, so I knew that he had a good idea of how to tell a great, suspenseful story. Four Blind Mice started off with an interesting premise and I felt like I had purchased another winner. Unfortunately, I was left quite disappointed. I felt that the story moved along at a great pace, but more intricate details were left for the imagination of the reader. The action seemed lacking and the climax was bland. If you are into a slightly amusing 4-hour read, then pick this one up. Otherwise, I'd stick to something a little more gripping."
4,A great suspense-filled novel!,"I believe this book was written beautifully, filled with nail-bitting suspense and new twists and turns. However, I did feel the book was too realistic and there was never a full conclusion."
1,Boring/Predictable/Yawn,"Did anyone even EDIT this book? Superficial, loose ends/""clues"" that were never tied up/explained, improbable timeline... all in all, a VERY messy and unsatisfying read. The formula is failing or the author just doesn't care - churn it out, make some bucks. Disappointing. Not worth the time or $."
4,Four Blind Mice,"""Four Blind Mice"" is the 8th Alex Cross novel by James Patterson. Alex Cross is on his way to resign from the Washington, DC police force when his friend, John Sampson asks him to help clear Sampson's friend Ellis Cooper of the murders of 3 women in North Carolina. The women were painted with blue paint. Before Sampson and Alex can find the real killer, Ellis Cooper is executed. Other murders occur in which the bodies are painted red, white, or blue and the person accused is innocent. These murders occur in places all over the US. Alex and John realize they are dealing with highly professional killers who had all served in Vietnam. Patterson writes page turners and ""Four Blind Mice"" is no different. The violence is graphic, and the suspense relentless. I thought that this novel was much better than the three Cross novels before it, but not nearly as good as the earlier ones like ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Jack and Jill"". I gave it four stars because of the page-turning suspense."
1,Patterson simply stinks these days,"I don't know why I bought this book; I've been less and less happy with Patterson's work. It's getting repetitive, the 8-million-chapters thing is just laziness for actually developing a story and/or characters, and his skills appear to have deteriorated beyond hope.But I bought it anyway, read the whole thing, and then did something I almost NEVER do. I chucked it straight into the trash.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you've liked his stuff in the past, you will almost certainly be disappointed."
1,Disappointing...to say the least,"I couldn't believe Patterson had sunk so low...but I guess he has. I've been following the books for awhile, avidly buying each as it comes out, but I just don't think I can stand to read them anymore. It started with the Women's Murder Club and has only gotten worse. The story was predictable, something I never expected of Patterson and the 'love interests' and Nana stuff is just horrible filler that is so uncharacteristic of what I've come to expect from Patterson that I almost couldn't finish it. What, did he write it in like a week? I still love Kiss the Girls and his earlier work but I can't put myself through another one of these. Save yourself the money."
3,Not As Good As Big Bad Wolf!,"The star of this book,Alex Cross,is about to resign from theWashington D.C. police force and join the F.B.I.His partner JohnSampsonhas a friend sentenced to die in the gas chamber and asks Alex to help.Sampson's friend has been tried by the U.S. Army.Cross and Sampson discover that the actual killers are threeFormer Army Rangers who are on a killing mission.Not only do they face the three Rangers but also their controller.They are in for a deadly and rough situation trying to bring thid group to justice.This book was a little slow getting to the point.Therewas too much time spent on matters outside of the action.I neverthought that the three Rangers and their controller would come into play."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"After reading two of Patterson's Alex Cross novels, I had high expectations for this one. The plot was ok, but that's just it. There was nothing special about the book. Actually, one certain scene that sticks out as silly is the one where an Asian gang appears and .... I'm about to read the Big Bad Wolf, I sincerely hope that it is much better than this one."
5,Four Blind Mice Alex Cross,It is Alex Cross. What more is there to say.James Patterson brings Alex to life in each new adventure.
3,Four Blind Mice,A bit too 'harlequinist' for my taste. I've gotten to where I don't care much for the Patterson books that were actually written by someone else.
3,rite 4 price,"The cover of the book was a bit bent out of shape, but its expected from a used softcover. But still of course one of my favorite authors James Patterson did it again, The book is awesome!!I got to buy more books from you soon because its much more enjoyable when you can add them to your fav affordable collectibles!"
2,There are way too many plot holes. Big ones.,"While the read was fun and engrossing, never dull, the obvious plot problems were glaring.The time between conviction and execution, the basis for investigation, is totally unbelievable. People in base housing at the time of the execution are witnesses to the murder (the average time in any one post is generally less than three years). Patterson really doesn't seem to know that much about the military beyond his own prejudices.The Army and the system that is the miliary are the bad guys in this book, which totally disgusted me."
3,So-so who dun it,"With a limited selection of English language books available, and minimal amounts in the ""who dun it"" genre, this was a logical choice. After reading all of the other books in the Alex Cross series, when I saw this one available, I naturally purchased it.While a life outside of the crime solving world is a part of any detective, Patterson is focusing more and more on the ""away from work"" love life and family life of his heroes. Should Nana Mama's health play a role that is a second plot line instead of insight into a character? Or the romance aspect? Again, insight, not an additional plot line. The two secondary ""personal life"" plots take away from the main story."
2,Boring,I can't believe this is the same author of the previous Alex Cross novels. It seems to me that the author cranked this out over a weekend. Patterson did not take the time to develop the characters or any of the background. I'll reading reviews on his new books before running off to buy his books. Maybe this is why sales are down for popular authors. They seem to be just cranking out junk just to make more money. What a shame.
3,Not his best attempt.,"James patterson has been writing so much that i tyhink he has forgotten what gt him here. His latest Alex Cross book is as fast paced as always, but he skips some of the little details that make the characters interesting and makes the plot flow. Hopefully this is the end of the Cross thrillers and James Patterson can find something fresh. Alex Cross is getting old (literally and figuratively). If you are a huge Cross fan you will read it, but if you are just starting out, dont bother. There are better cross novels and fresher charactersin other patterson books (ie. Murder club ladies - 1st To Die and 2nd Chance). In the end I say pass...."
2,5th blind mouse.,"Wish I hadn't picked this book up. It was nasty. There was no flow to the writing, the plot was weak, every sentence seem to be a new chapter. I got the feeling that the story was writen as a screen play. The author didn't take the time to develop the story, characters or environment. Just a long list of names and a ridiclious case that had more holes then the OJ trial. Read CRAIS, or Connelly, or Ludlum. They are stories, this is Mr. Mugs finds a clue."
2,Disappointing,There were more holes in this plot than an Iraqi mine field. Patterson phoned this one in; don't bother.
3,Writing in his sleep?,"I thought this was a very ""unthrilling"" thriller and I am a James Patterson FANATIC. He did seem to repeat himself a lot (mostly regarding flying after 9/11) and I couldn't really get thrilled about any of the story lines. I mean, by the middle of the book, you know who the killers are and he just fills in with Sampson's love life (which, don't get me wrong, I'd love to get to know more about Sampson, but this was even kinda boring) and Alex's rendevous with his west coast girlfriend. I'm looking forward to the Jester and hope he can revitalize his writing with this new direction. I also enjoyed the Women's Murder Club series and hopes he gets #3 out soon."
4,Another Alex Cross Bonanza,"It is a time of change and Alex has another haunting serial murder case to solve, before he and his family become the next target. Alex has a new love and surprisingly so does Sampson :) The story is fast paced, a lil violent and very potent. I would definately recommend it to any thriller readers. I can't wait for the next installment."
3,"As Patterson goes, it's only an ""average""","Yes. I am a Patterson fan. This book is a worthy effort and I did enjoy it but it just wasn't as good as some of the earlier books in the Alex Cross series. Still, it's a ""must read"" for Patterson fans, particularly if you're an Alex Cross fan."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I am usually a fan, however, I did find this work to be disappointing. Alex and John work to find evidence to keep a friend of John's from being executed. It doesn't work out for them and instead they follow a trail going back to the Vietnam War and discover a cover-up of brutality committed by American Soldiers against the Vietnamese people. Alex's relationship with Jamilla continues and John Sampson encounters a new love as well. I just didn't find it up to Patterson's usual standard as far as plot twists and turns. I didn't want to hear Alex express one more time that he had finally made one mistake too many and wouldn't live. I found the portrayal of Alex's family couriously flat and even though Nana was encountering major health problems I didn't care as much as I might have in the earlier novels when she was more dimensional. I guess I'm looking forward to Alex's new job and hoping that the next Cross novel is better."
4,"Mice are like Rice, when you're Godzilla","Oh boy! You can imagine my excitement when I finally purchased a copy of ""Four Blind Mice"" -- the book that the local chapter of Hopeful Homosexuals of Guatemala has titled ""...a true coming out of the closet novel for both the protagonist and the villain.""The daisy chain formed by Cross, Cooper, and Samson is top-notch, and the fur really flew when Patterson decided to throw in a few mice into the mix. WOW!But despite all this excitement, something was missing...something that I'm sure all readers of ""Four Blind Mice"" was left asking: did each mouse know that there were three others, and hence he was not special? Maybe this question is best left unanswered, but I for one would've given it the fifth star if Patterson tied this knot."
2,I keep looking for another Patterson thriller but this wasn't it,"A lot of loose ends abound, such as why the innocent victims were selected, how the master minds operated from solitary confinement in prison, and how all the evidence was fabricatedSince I gave four stars to the first three books in the Alex Cross series, I wonder if Patterson really wrote this book. This plot was simplistic, unbelievable and too pat.I have complained about all the white space in each of the eight books by Patterson that I have read, so I will just say that C. H Mitchum (Chelmsford, MA USA) posted a review on January 27, 2003 that captures my sentiments exactly."
3,I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!,Patterson amazed me with this true-to-life and colourful tale. I was mildly amused by his vivid imagery...
1,Patterson's Worst,"This ""effort""(?) by author Patterson is extremely disappointing. The military backdrop which constitutes the fundamental basis for this publishing disaster is a poorly researched and contains egregious factual errors, shallow detail and grossly stretched credibility. The plot projection is ""fleshed out"" by graphic gory detail and superfluous sex which the reader is expected to relate to reading entertaiment. The inclusion of this disaster on recent bestseller listings can only be from the derived momentum of Patterson's past literary eclat with his Alex Cross character; clearly this book would never be looked at by a responsible publisher were it the author's early effort. I am embarrassed that I was ""conned"" into buying it and that I humiliated myself by finishing it!"
2,"If you like sex, violence and political correctness","If you like sex, violence and abundent political correctness at a third grade reading level, this is the book for you. If you are desperate for time to kill and can stomach his mainstream style, this book fits the bill. This book does move fast and at times can be full of thrills and adventures, however, the ending is anticlimactic. His obvious agenda taints what could be an enjoyable experience.The Road Warrior from Philly"
1,Losing his touch,"I find it hard to believe the reviewers quoted on the covers and front pages of this book actually read it. The plot is choppy, made worse by 1-2 page ""chapters"". A sloppy lack of follow-up (what happened to girlfriend Marcia? Who wrote the faked ""love letters""? etc.) makes it confusing and frustrating to follow. Mix in excessive amount of graphic violence, which does nothing to further the plot. Add in characters who speak in unrealistic and stilted dialogue, and you have this book. A huge disappointment."
1,What a Shame,"Again, I am disappointed by a recent JP novel. Sloppy writing and ridiculous plot, sex unrelated the story. JP's earlier novels are great and there was a time when I would plunk down money for them no questions. No longer. I will feel them out at the library before I shell out money. JP is churning out crap and expecting his name to carry the sales of the book."
2,First-time Patterson reader,"...so take my review for what it is worth! I picked this one up on a whim, and was disappointed by it. The chapters are insanely short, many of them less than three pages. Sometimes there is a chapter break in the middle of a scene, and the next chapter picks up right where the other one left off! It made it hard for me to focus on the book.The plot was OK at best. As a 14-year veteran of the military, I found most of the military scenes to be unlikely at best. Maybe he had some military personnel giving him info, but it sure seems unlikely to me.Finally, the dialogue seemed forced and fake to me. The best writers make you feel like you are in the world of the book; this novel made me feel like I was reading a novel attempting to present real dialogue. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably like this book. Otherwise, approach it with caution."
4,A good read if you like Patterson,"This book was pretty good. I was not disappointed that I read it. It was not Patterson's best Alex Cross novel, but it wasn't his worst either. Any Cross fan will enjoy this read and it is worth the time in my opinion."
4,Couldn't Put it Down,I really enjoy Patterson's writing style. Chapters just seem to flow very well together. Love the Cross Character. Highly recommend this book I kept turning the pages and couldn't put it down.
5,Blind mice can't read & enjoy this but you will,Another Alex Cross masterpiece where Alex is this timebrought back to the serial killer chase by an oldfriend of his partner Samson's army days who has adilemma. He is about to be face execution for adespicable violent murder spree and everyone isconvinced of his guilt except Samson. Cross is hislast chance. A foursome of killers is reliving theirVietnam killing days and Cross must deal with them asthey cross his path. Meanwhile Alex's family isfacing their own life threatening dilemmas. Who isfunding the killers? Why are they killing? Do theyhave anything to do with Sampson's friend's case?This is one of the best Alex Cross novels written.The usual short chapter style makes this like theothers a breeze to read. You don't need to readprevious Cross series books first to enjoy this onebut you will get more out of it you do. Previousbooks are sensational as well.
3,"typical patterson, but not up to snuff",its a typical patterson but not as spine tingling as the others. my 2 cents: read it to complete the set; but don't expect too much.
2,Not Much Cheese in This One,"It's not clear to me what Patterson's attraction is. He does write the shortest chapters of any modern author (even shorter than Robert B. Parker's, but all that does is add white space and pages. In this book Alex cross is embarking on his ""last case"" to prove that a friend of a friend is being framed for a murder. Alas, he fails, but in the process realizes that someone is going to a lot of trouble to frame former Viet Nam veterans for murder and being very successful. We learn early on who is doing it, but not who is ordering the killing. Many dead bodies later we find out the answer which is somewhat predictable and not very startling. I was given this book as a gift. I am thankful that I did not shell out hard cash for it. If you like this author, I suggest the library or waiting for paper back."
4,How does Alex Cross get all his time off from Washington ?,This novel was an improvement over the last couple Alex Cross novels.One question that keeps nagging at me while reading these books is: How does Alex get all of his time off to solve all these mysteries which take place outside of Washington Metro. I feel that Patterson should have made the transition to FBI much more quickly.Patterson uses a common story line in all of these novels.1. The Cross family is threatened.2. Former villians show up again.3. Alex falls for another cop.4. Alex gets beaten up.All four subplots show up again in this novel.This book was fast moving and kept me interested.
3,Status Quo,"Patterson has surpassed the apex of his career. This novel is very easy to read, but lacks some character developments. 4 Blind Mice is rudimentary and clearly indicates that JP is writing books just for the money. His books are truncated in depth and length and he isn't fooling anyone with all the white space and 2-page chapters. Step-up, Patterson is give us a good rope!Still a very quick read."
4,Another feather in Patterson's hat,"I am the type that when I find an author I like, I tend to read all of thier books, regardless of the subject matter. I have have read all of Patterson's book to date. I have always been pleased with his writtings, some more than others of course. I must say this Four Blind Mice was one of the more enjoyable reads. It did have more twists and insight than his normal Cross novels and they played well.If you like Patterson and the Cross series, this is a must read."
4,Back to the basics...,"Unlike other more ""smooth jazz"" albums of Albright's, this one is more likely to pique the interest of the jazz purist. This album does contain a ballad or two, and also includes a very soulful, almost gospel tinged version of ""Georgia on my Mind."" Watch that solo, it is definitely off the charts! The sound quality is very superior as well. While listening to it, you'll forget that it is actually a ""Live"" album. Whether you're a jazz purist or love the modern sounds of CD 101.9, you have to add this to your jazz collection."
4,Was great in my social studies class!,I enjoyed using this video with my 8th grade students. It was very informative on many aspects of the building of the transcontinental railroad. It showed the dangers faced by these hard-working men as they struggled to link the eastern and western parts of the US. Great images and great information! Thanks History Channel!
2,Overkill,"I read Death Trap, by Mr. Phelps and enjoyed it enough to buy another of his books. A nurse, possibly having killed as much as 40 patients is something that gets one's attention. It is something one is horrified about. And Mr. Phelps is justly horrified, but as an author is too horrified. He writes the book as for someone he does not trust to be as horrified as him. He treats us readers as sociopaths, as mentally challenged sociopaths. He hammers in the same key multiple times so we get it. He goes over excruciating dull details to make us believe that woman spent 24hours a day, seven days a week being evil. He paints her as close as a mustachioned person tying an innocent to train tracks as he can get away with,and in doing so he commits the worse fellony a writer can do, he is boring. The only reason I gave him 2 stars was because he has done his research.Next time I will stick with authors that can make a statement without either treating me like a 3 year old or boring me to death"
2,"The ""Angel of Death"" really isn't that interesting....","This book was an accurate and comprehensive account of Kristen Gilbert's crimes and prosecution. Phelps has obviously done his research, and did a fair job recreating the time line and relating the story in a readable way.Only the first quarter of the book covered Gilbert's commission of crimes, the majority of the book covered her prosecution and trial. I found this part a bit dry, and thus the two stars.If you really love true crime books, this will likely end up on your list. If not, I'd recommend you pass...."
5,Bizarre story,"This book is well-written, and the story is fascinating. It's frustrating that the killer went so long undetected, but eventually the case was solved."
4,Excellent read for true crime fans,"This is a well-written, pacy account of a murderous nurse. My only criticism is that I would have liked more in-depth information on the murderer's early life, showing the development of her strange, narcissistic, vindictive personality, but of course it may not have been possible to obtain this."
4,Blown Away,"My wife showed me this book and said, ""You've got to read this -It's about happenings in my home town."" I was skeptical as our reading tastes are very different plus I secretly thought her interest was the home town connection. However with her nursing background and mine in criminal justice this book was an ideal match. I picked up ""Perfect Poison"" and couldn't put it down, reading the entire book in one setting. The in depth research is logical and extensive. The author provides insights in the activites and the mind of the killer that will intrigue the reader. Moreover, the sequence of events is easy to follow and provides a graphic image of the pain and suffering for the victims and secondary victims. This book held my interest throughout the reading. I'm indebted to my wife and brother-in-law for recommending this book and thus providing a quality reading experience."
3,Great,If you love True Crime then you will read this from start to finish without stopping. Enjoy and think about how lucky you are to be alive.
3,True crime,Every once in ahwile I read a true crime story just to mix things up. As I read this story I was most amazed that something like this could happen so easily. It wasn't the best story I have ever read but the pages did fly by pretty quickly.
5,Enthralling,"I usually require that authors have a good command of the English language but in this case I'll make an exception. This absorbing story kept me fascinated from cover to cover. I'm a voracious reader of true crime; this is one of the best I've ever read, which is saying a lot. I'm also an RN and could follow the medical aspects easily. I'm so glad this nurse no longer can have contact with patients!! Phelps could stand to take a good course in writing, however. The author is also sloppy about getting some details right. Some of the medical words were misspelled and/or misleading. But the story itself rings loud and true, overcoming the author's defects. A great read!"
5,great read,being from the area this book describes makes it even more interesting. Knowing how the hospital was run and the people involved makes it a good read. I wish the victims families were able to add their statements at the end. I have run into them and they put a whole new aspect to this story.Theses victims and their families count no matter what brought them to the VA.
5,An Action Packed Read,"I liked EEWEE Crossing very Much.The main character T.M.Krebs also known as Top is an Air Force reservist who has spent time on the Mexican/Texas border observing people crossing illegally but, due to the Posse Comitatus Act, can only radio his observations to the U.S Border Patrol to help them stop the flow of the illegals and the drugs.With Top's commitment to the War on Drugs he comes up with an idea that would help to beef up the ""the thin green line"". Top's idea was to use volunteer military reservists deputized as U.S Marshal reservists and Project Alliance is put into action with Top leading the way.As a former resident of Marfa, Texas I felt the Author's description of the local area, from El Paso to Marfa, was so accurate it felt like I was revisiting those areas. I felt like I was getting a back seat view in a patrol car and apart of the action from the under cover surveillance to the climactic gun battles."
1,fake one,"i used to buy this product and it's much more thicker than the one I purchased here. I still have this product at home now, it's just like a regular condition, not a deep conditioner."
2,not that good,"I bought this album b/c I am a huge reggae fan and also love Martha's Vineyard. Unfortunately most of the songs on this album are from Americans, and thus the reggae isn't that good. Carly Simon's cover of ""Is This Love"" is atrocious. There are a few good songs, but there are a lot of songs that aren't even really reggae--more folk/country/blues....Don't buy this album...."
3,had potential,"The first three episodes had be absolutely hooked. Then there were umpteen red herrings, watching the family grieve got to the point of misery porn and it just became to much. The last episode was so terrible I have no reason or desire to care about a second season. If only it had stayed more true to the Danish version which was far better.There were some fantastic episodes, but the lukewarm/terrible/far-fetched episodes outweighed the good. Watch the Danish version if you really want to see some fantastic tv. The American version started off so well and the potential looked phenomenally good. Too bad they wasted it. Generous 3 stars."
1,Never felt so cheap as I did after the season finale,"The creator might argue that this series is a about developing interesting characters, that it's not just a series of cheap dramatic tricks with no payoff. She'd be wrong on both counts. She over-relies on misdirection and ambiguity in developing her charcaters, and in the end most of them seem contrived and two-dimensional. What's worse is she persuaded me to become emotionally invested in her central dramatic question, ""Who killed Rosie Larsen?"" Only to be told, ""I'm not going to tell you, besides that's not what the show is about."" Really? What rubbish! AMC cancels Rubicon and gives us this tripe. I will not be back for season 2. Who killed Rosie Larsen? I couldn't care less."
5,A Mystery Made Fun,"It's a pity when people can appreciate a good show and just want a quick resolution. This is no X-Files which goes on and on, but a mystery/thriller show that focuses on finding who killed Rosie Lawson. It lets you see every angle of the search for who did it, and allows us to feel each character's emotion. From frustration at why they can't figure out the clues to heartache for a family that lost their child, this is not your typical TV show. Why can't people appreciate beautiful cinematography, music and acting? This show has got it all with a relatively unknown cast of actors who bring a fun and edge-of-the-seat show. AMC keeps hitting the ball out of the ballpark with their shows and this one is one heck of a homer.Recommended for those who like 24, LOST and Dexter.The Killing: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]"
5,Addicted,"If you like to watch TV marathons, this is the one for you. Don't forget to get the second season."
2,Not so good ...,"More red herrings than a Danish fishing fleet. More plot twists than a pound of pretzels. And in the end ... ""what just happened?"" ""Huh?"" Would love to see the Danish original. Pretty darn expensive."
4,Question,"Good show, engaging characters and a plot that keeps you guessing. My one concern is how long they're going to drag out the investigation. I've seen other shows that started out really good and then became more and more ridiculous as the writers threw in unneccessary plots just to continue the series. On a sidenote- is it just me or does the casino symbol look a lot like the emblem used in the Hunger Games trilogy?"
3,Not bad americanisation but the danish original is much better,"I did not know, that this show was the ""american version"" of ""Forbrydelsen"" a danish tv show. I have seen this show shortly before but watched ""The Killing"" anyway til the (different) ending because its a great piece of tv.But if you want more suspense and a lot more drive, you should watch the original which is availeble also at the european amazon shops. (In german ""Kommissarin Lund Season 1"" incl. english language).The Killing - Complete Season 1 - 5-DVD Box Set ( Forbrydelsen (Forbrytelsen) ) ( The Killing - Complete Season One ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]"
5,Wonderful Series,This is such a great suspenseful crime series. Pulls you in on the first episode and keeps you hanging. Hoping season 2 will hurry up and come to Amazon!
5,"Loved the pilot, bought the whole series.","I've only seen the first episode so far, but it was very promising. I was hoping this wouldn't be too much of a Twin Peaks copycat, because I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks and I doubt it could ever be successfully replicated. Fortunately, The Killing has its own unique strengths and doesn't feel at all like a weak Twin Peaks facsimile.It's not exactly a spoiler to say that Rosie turns up dead in the pilot. However, the suspense building up to the moment detective Sarah Linden & co. find her body is compelling -- quite a trick, given that this detail of the plot is revealed by the show's very title! If they keep up this level of tension, I'll be happily addicted soon enough."
5,The Killing season one,The show was like reading a great book. You usually cannot get so many sub plots in a show but this one has it all
1,BOOOOOO!,"Save 13 hours of your life and wait for the ""writers"" of this this ""mini series"" to figure out a way to ""re-imagine"" 3 hours of content into 13 more hours of season 2... Funny how this was supposed to wrap up this season until the ""writers"" got signed up for a season 2 just 2 weeks before the season finale..."
4,Archive,"I Don't watch much t.v. So miss a lot, with Kindle Fire I found a great mystery and looking forward to Season 2 to watch at my liesure."
1,I may give a try. Too Bad no Real Danish version on amazon,"As usual the Americans somehow seem to avoid subtitles?? And quality film. I am sure this copy/ remake of the acclaimed series is ok or maybe even better than ok? But why not at least offer the real thing. Amazon, to its credit offers the original Wallanders, well some versions, only one episode with Rolf.Why take a gem like Dragon Tattoo and Americanize it??...money I guess, or for people who can not read fast enough?I will upgrade when I take a look..but for now still searching for real thang."
4,Great show...but,"Amazing first episode. Really good. One of the most interesting stuff on television this last year. However, the rest of the season, more twelve episodes, is full of ups and downs. In certain point, there is the weird feeling that the writers don't know exactly what to do to fill the time spot. In my opinion the worst moment is the episode focused on Jack, Sarah's son. A real bad one. The final episode is also problematic. There are lots of stuff going on, but without enough time to put things together properly. Extra points to the cast. Mireille Enos, Joel Kinnaman and Brent Sexton are superb."
5,Totally Engrossing!,"This series cannot be ""caught up"" with. Each episode must be watched carefully; savored and digested with quiet time at its end to contemplate what just occurred. The Killing is smart, savvy, engaging adult fare. No car chases, no buildings being blown up, nothing but quiet and intense drama. The actors are superb in their craft and the plot is way too believable especially in light of the times we are living through. I don't know about the Danish version but I hear the same comments applied to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Maybe after completing this wonderful series I'll venture the subtitle route and compare. If you haven't seen each and every episode get with the program asap. Season 2 is coming up. Can't hardly wait."
3,OMG! That was 12 hours of my life I will never get back!,"I kept thinking that they would solve it this week and move on to a new case. Had I known that this whole series was going to be about the same dead girl, I would have chosen to watch another new series. This show should have been a made for tv movie. How can the writers justify calling this a series when the story line is about one girl's death. All my hard work watching this season, only to find out, that in the end, nothing is as it seems. I don't think I'll be back next season! What a waste of time!"
5,got me cought up,I Started watching this in second year and this got me cought up so makes it better keep up with. Disk were in great shape
4,WOW ~ totally surprised by this series!,"I happened to catch season 1 on Netflix by accident. Got hooked immediately and then had to immediately find season 2 to watch. The acting was outstanding. A few of the twists were like ""wtf, really?"" but it wasn't a complete impossibility so I forgive them, otherwise I would give it 5 stars. I highly recommend this series and series 2. Wow."
5,2nd best show,second only to breaking bad. the back ground music is perfect. it leaves you wanting more. great acting great twist
1,The Killing: Season One,"Haven't had a chance to watch it yet. Will write this review after I watch it, but looking forward to the experience."
2,So good...at first.,"I really enjoy shows on AMC, I watch Breaking Bad and Mad Men, and I was so excited for The Killing. I absolutely loved the first 4 episodes or so, I thought that there was wonderful character development and it was so interesting and intriguing, I also really liked how the characters looked like real people and not super models. But then, after about the 4th episode, things starting going a little bit too slow.Especially by the time the 3rd to last episode rolled around, an entire episode that had nothing to do with the murder investigation whatsoever. It was just a filler episode. The show got so boring, they made it sound like it was this great new idea to have a murder investigation span on over a full series, but I think they could have done a much better job.The last episode was especially disappointing, I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet, but I was honestly angry after I finished watching it and pissed off about the whole season."
2,Where's the Log Lady when you need her?,"One review on this site called The Killing ""Twin Peaks"" Minus The Extravagant Quirkiness. They're exactly right, which is why this overrated show is so dull. There are no likable characters; a workaholic who neglects her child, an absent mother who neglects her child, a violent, racist father, an ex(?)junkie who falsifies evidence, at least two politicians (say no more), etc. Yes, yes, tell me about how these are Real People, not stereotypes, and I say here is a perfect example of why not everyone merits their own television show. The only thing this show has done is make me not care in the slightest who killed Rosie. Seriously, go buy Twin Peaks. The Killing is just stealing the pedestrian parts of that show, and making a good hour wasted."
2,No End,"Be aware, when you start watching the first season, you will not find out who did it. There is an episode of padding thrown in, instead of a resolution. I understand that season 2 will not show a resolution until the end of the season. I resent this type of manipulation of the audience. Starting a new mystery, before the end of the first one, would have been acceptable to me, but not drawing out the ending for so long. I will not be watching season 2."
5,Awesome TV drama/thriller,"Full of mystery, some of it predictable and some of it not. Really like how it is not like CSI or Criminal Minds with all the make believe high-tech forensics stuff. Good actors & great complex drama."
5,Great TV,"While not quite as good as AMC compatriots Mad Men and Breaking Bad (perhaps its lack of twin first letters is to blame?) it nonetheless is a striking and involving series. The production values are on par with AMC quality and I felt drawn to the characters almost immediately.And that's where The Killing differentiates itself from all the mindless cop dramas out there - its attention to, and focus on, its characters. That is the sole advantage television enjoys over cinema - the ability to develop personalities and explore their complexities in real time. And this show makes no effort to mask that this is what the show is ultimately about - not the crime the central players happen to be investigating. Indeed, nearly an entire show is taken up with no mention of the murder case.Further, this strength underlies the prime virtue of stories of fiction: it's ability to enlarge your world and gain some understanding of what it feels like to be somebody else. The Killing amply accomplishes this."
4,Finding Rosie is one long case,"I have now watched the first three episodes. I did not get into the story until the second episode and if I did not watch it right after the first I may not have continued the series. The first episode is a introduction to the main investigators life as well as Rosie's family. Unlike other police/investigation shows, this show sticks with one case through the whole series which is what is going to keep you coming back wanting to know what happens."
3,deflated,"great idea for costume. deflates quickly. should be better quality material.Also name of ""Fat Bastard"" is necessary because characters name in Austin Powers Movie is Fat Bastard. Movie was rated PG13.In the context that it is being used it is not a curse word. It means a person who is held to be mean or disagreeable. Houghton Dictionary"
1,disgusted,"I am shocked that while looking on the Toys R Us website with my kids, trying to find a halloween costume, I came across this one. What sickens me the most isn't the fact that you have adult costums at a kids toy store, or the fact that you would actually put this costume in your store, but that my son just asked me what a bastard was!!! What are you thinking??!!!! It is also kind of ironic that in the review guidlines for posting a review states that you can't include profanity or the review will not be posted. I just hope that you don't have any other toys with curse words in them. I won't know because I have chosen not to shop with Toys R Us again. I think you should really think about what is appropriate for a kid store and take this one out of the stores and website."
1,Big Disappointment,"I had read a few positive things about this disc and being an SLF fan for many years, I was upbeat about the prospect of new, decent SLF music. However, I was not terribly impressed with it. It did come closer than other recent attempts by the band, but was lacking something. Perhaps the band should move in a new direction, if for no other reason than to give poor Jake's voice a rest."
5,Great bank,I bought 2 buddha banks for my 2 year old son. He loves them. A great alternativeto a traditional piggy bank and a good way for him to start saving coins.
2,"Nice Idea, but it doesn't work","I wanted to be more environmentally friendly, so I bought these. I end up putting 2 cubes for each load. Plus, I have to set the dishwasher to hot water cycle and rinse. I've been waiting to finish up the 6 pack... but I must admit, when I have company or a party ... I use the electrosol gel packs. I did keep the containers ... so I can put my electrosol in them instead of dealing with the bag and box."
3,Not clean enough,"I wanted to use environment friendly products , but I have to say that this has been a dissappointment. I have used Cascade in the pat and I was pleased with the sparkle and clean mugs and plates. Method detergent is a poor subsititute. Baked in crusts remain with repeated washing cycles. Coffee/Tea stain remains in the cup. I have reverted to using Cascade once or twice a week to get my cups, plates or glasses to a sparkling clean state as method does not remove all the stains or restore shine as well as Cascade does."
5,a must have!!,"this book features both well designed illustrations and in depth texts. one piece for each artist, the book shows the most details specifically mentioned in the text. several pieces even design to demonstrate the setup which are folded in the same way as the real altarpieces. printing quality is good. few images, though, i think, are a little out of focus. but it didn't interupt me to dig out the information i need. it is hard to find another book at this level in the market today."
5,Another great tool for the workshop,"This very useful book was put to immediate use. I just bought a mini-mill for my workshop and this book provided the background and details that I needed to be productive right away. It helped me pick the right support tools and fixtures that I would need. My accuracy went up after the first look at the book. If you have a question, you can go to the book and find the answer quickly as the illustrations really help you locate the information you need just by browsing. Thank you Frank!!"
5,Bandolino boots,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the Bandolino Women's Stela Ankle Boot. The boots look and feel wonderful and though I paid very little for them, the quality is apparent."
1,cheap rip off---only one star..don't know why it still says four!!!!,This boot looks good and is comfortable to wear; but after a very short time several months light wear...the soles began to disintegrate to my surprise...what third world sweat shop created this mess---where is quality? and how could they sell such a shoddy product? I was appalled. I had to throw it away along with my money!!
3,"A Good Introduction, Intermediate and up look elsewhere.","If you are begining chess, this is an excellent book to start with. It covers enough of most aspects of the game to get you started right. It should give an excellent and solid foundation. I wish it had been available to me 20 years ago. If you are above the level of beginner, you will likely pick up some useful ideas from the book, but most of what it contains you will have learned by bitter experience. The format and writing are excellent. Text moves can be followed in all but a few diagrams without a board, which makes it easy and pleasurable to read. The book contains two errors that I noticed, one dealing with a stalemate and another illustrating Alekhines Gun. Even so, this book contains what a new player needs, and it would be among my first recomendations to the novice. A more accurate title would be a ""Basic Book of Chess Strategy."""
4,Very useful for beginners,"In spite of its grandiose title, Silman's book is written for beginners, and for more experienced players who want a review of the basics. It's divided into three parts - guess what - openings, middle game, and endgame. The Middle Game and End Game sections are very good, and cover important and interesting beginning-to-middle-strength player topics like basic checkmates (Morphy's Mate), pawn structure, and knights vs. bishops. The Openings section is less successful, because he just shows the first few moves and doesn't get into the really critical variations.Silman is a great teacher, and I wish that I had read this book when I was just starting out in chess. If you are just starting out I would recommend it very highly. It will give beginning players a very solid foundation. More advanced (1500 or so) players might want to check out ""The Amateur's Mind,"" by the same author, that covers the same ground but more in depth."
2,Not great to say the least,"This book is absolutley not a complete book of chess strategy. The ideas in it are explained VERY briefly so beginners can't really understand them. To advanced players this book is ueless of course since they know all this. The section about openings is the worst one. It doesn't explain the ideas of the openings, but it shows very short lines as examples which of course mean nothing to a beginner. In my opinion a much better option instead of this book is ""The mammoth book of chess"". it has everything this book has and more. it also explains everything in a much better way, and it's cheaper."
5,"Astounding breadth, depth, and heft.","The Complete Book of Chess Strategy is as evocative as a drizzly summer evening. Speaking of evenings, they are the best time of day to play chess, according to this book, because eye-hand coordination is most acute between 7:15pm and 10:25pm, Central Mountain Time. Jeremy Silman masterfully explains the role of all the pieces on the board, their relationship to each other, and why they can't share the same clothes. One odd chapter illustrates the mechanics of Singer sewing machines from the 1950s, and is best skipped. Despite occasional tangential rants about commodity prices in eastern Europe, this book is highly recommended for players of all shoe sizes, though vegetarians will probably be put off by the author's ""Ode to Meat"" in the preface. Checkers and backgammon are sadly slighted."
2,Not a Standout in a Competitive Field,"This is just not a good book. It's not well-written, not well-edited, and not well-organized. Though I was at first impressed by Silman, I don't care for this effort...there are much better books available for the novice. A good deal of this book is devoted to (very basic) discussion of the openings, and while openings are of course the basic elements of any strategy, that's not what I would expect from a book with this title. I can't recommend this to any but novice players."
2,Reference book,This book really doesn't teach strategy which is what I bought it for. It is more of an A-Z reference of chess techniques.
2,Jermy Silman,"Quite a simplistic book, bu it's ok for beginning players. He explains a lot of theory, but provides too litlle examples. Also, the chapters are short. It's just a beginners chessbook"
5,Complete Book of Chess Strategy,Item was received quickly and well packaged. The book is a very readable approach to understanding the sometimes complex game of chess.
5,chess strategy,"the game of chess fascinates me. for the average player one move will make a win or loss. ""the complete book of chess strategy"" has helped me to really focus and make better moves. it gives reasons why one move is superior to another. an excellent teaching tool to use again and again and at my leisure although i don't tell opponents my secret weapon"
5,A Great Book for Beginner/Intermediate Players,"This book is great in that it presents all of the considerations for a chess game in one place. While some of the descriptions and explanations are rather brief, this is more of an all-in-one summary book, either for a brief introduction to the elements of chess, or as a review.If you are a beginner player, then this book is great as a primer, but don't expect it to boost your play too much, at least not until you get more experience with the elements discussed in this book. While I knew some of the things in this book already, I mainly used it as an introduction, and am planning to read about some of the particulars more in-depth later from other sources.If you want a book to introduce you to the important aspects of chess to prime you for some more complicated books, then this is a good one. Grade: A-"
1,RipOff,This is advertised as 5 pp. but is 1300 words long. Barely 2 pp. in my browser. Better articles exist in wikipedia for free.
1,Disappointed,"DisappointedI purchased the level, removed it from the box, and tried it out around the house. One of the pushbuttons didn't work the first 10 times I tried it. I was just about to box it up and send it back but it started to work. I should have gone with my first instinct, return it. After trying to use it to lay out a garage, 30 days later, my thought on the level is it doesn't work very well. The repeatability is poor. It is too dim to use outside, unless it is dusk. It was too late for me to return the item, I had throw away the original cardboard cover and had keep it for 30 days, otherwise I would send it back."
3,"Lots of potential, but lots of problems","At first, I thought this book would be a really well-crafted Regency....that impression didn't last.I thought the murder mystery was interesting even though some of the characters were obviously there for nothing more than plot devices. Some of the characters are interesting but are not quite right for the story. For example, the hero, Adam, is left in charge of the murder investigation, but he knows nothing about how to go about it even though he's a spy. Well, it gives the Russian prince a reason to be there....but that seriously dilutes the hero's strength. Elizabeth is an interesting heroine, and she and Adam do have some chemistry. There were enough potential villains to keep the mystery going; the main problem was Adam's recurring inability to handle it himself. It made him weak; he didn't even get the chance to save the heroine.So....okay, better than most series Regencies, but could have been so much better. 2 & 3/4 stars"
1,don't bother with this one,"Although the author's previous regency, The Scotsman and the Spinster wasn't half bad, the Sinister Spinster is. Bad.Madison gives us a third rate murder mystery in regency dress. It is so badly done that she cannot even keep track of her own plot twists. And as to the regency dress, she knows little of the period and gets everything wrong, from forms of address to class distinctions. Oh, and the love story is the worst sort of emotionless, motiveless formula."
1,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"This CD is far inferior compared to Alan's other albums. First of all, 9 songs is not enough for one CD. Also, most of Alan's best songs are not on here. Go buy ""The Greatest Hits Collection"". You will get more than twice as many songs for only a slightly higher price. That CD also truly has Alan's 'Greatest Hits'."
5,Great physics detective story,"This is a great physics detective story, and it blends history and science together to give a picture of how we have measured what was once considered unmeasurable.There are some minor annoyances, such as her repeatedly explaining scientific notation (perhaps a brief appendix could be included in a future edition). Also, she could have explained how the parsec came to be, rather than just using it with no explanation.There are some notes at the end of the book that give the reader suggestions for further reading. To her credit, she includes Halton Arp's concerns about the use of redshift (See Arp's book, Seeing Red).This book builds up a clear picture of how we built up the cosmic distance ladder, and the missteps along the way."
5,How do you measure the Universe?,"I have always had a love of astronomy and space exploration, but the distances and measurements used by stargazers always bewildered me. `Measuring the Universe' takes you through, step by step, each astronomical discovery, and the people and methods used, to assist you in better understanding concepts such as `What is a parsec?' or `How do they measure the distance to a star?' (not as accurate as I thought).There are also interesting stories about the private lives of some astronomers such as Eratsthenes of Cyrene (measured the diameter of the Earth), Galileo and Edwin Hubble.A clever mix of textbook and novel, something that any budding or professional astronomer should read."
5,Forbidden Broadway 5 is (happily) up to its usual tricks,"If you're a Forbidden Broadway fan and/or you keep up to date on the latest Broadway shows and going-ons, this is a must-have CD. Creator Gerard Allesandrini is up to his usual parody-mayhem in this fifth recording of Forbidden Broadway material, featuring four multi-talented cast members from the Off-Broadway show.This latest version includes drawn-out parodies of ""The Lion King,"" ""Ragtime,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Cabaret""; and as usual they are side-splittingly funny. I can distinctly recall laughing out loud quite often while listening, and not just on my first listen.Unlike previous CDs, the CD sleeve of ""Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!""--the title of this 5th volume--includes the libretto, allowing you to comprehend every word of Allesandrini's brilliant parodies (once you get past all the typos).Wonderful performances and hysterical parodies make this CD a necessity for all fans."
4,Several options using 3 or 4 basic folds....,The book gives relatively clear instructions and has corresponding drawings to help diagram. Makes for a great basics type of book. I had hoped for a few folding techniques that were more dramatic...it is still a fine book with many different folds.
2,Repetition of same material,"A repeat of the same jokes on Youtube and Pandora. No new material.He is funny and a great delivery, but until there is new material, just listen from the internet"
4,Give this guy a Nobel Peace Prize,"The down side to this CD is if you've heard/seen anything else by Fatel, then a good amount of the material here will be very familiar. The plus side is that the guy still makes it so funny it hurts. Also, the bonus recording of his first standup performance is a nice addition."
1,horrible,"Do buy this. It was horrible, I bearly got through the first 30 minutes then I just couldn't take it anymore. I kept waiting for it to get better, then I just couldn't take it anymore."
3,It's a good little movie.,It's a good movie. It seems to end a little too soon. The film is mostly comprised of five short stories about couples and their relationships/situations. I was left wanting a little more. Maybe there will be a sequel. The soundtrack is very good.
4,A good day to be black and sexy,"Loved it...very well thought out and anyone who has had any kind of sexual encounter could relate to this movie. I recommend it, especially for African American moms and their teenage daughters to watch together."
1,Not good at all!,"This movie did not make too much sense to me what so ever. The acting wasn't the greatest and the script was pretty vague. There were only like two chapters in this whole movie that made some bit of sense. Sorry, but this film did not do much for me at all. Glad i rented it first. So now I know I won't be buying it."
4,Excellent film,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The title of the film suggested gratuitous sex and graphic nudity, with perhaps very little substance. That title is deceptive, thank heavens. It consists of four vignettes about black relationships. However, the scenarios are so realistic, that they are cross ethnic and cultural and just ultimately reflect the human condition that we all share and that's simply trying to find reason in love, sex and relationships. The way it was shot and the direction and dialogue was so realistic that it almost felt as though it were a documentary at times. Great job by a new director. Loved it!"
5,cookbook just right!,The cookbook was just perfect!Arrived in time for Christmas gifting and my aunt was thrilled to receive it.Seller was 100% on this one!
4,Costly but good,"Bought a few of months ago in winter for more thab $200, put on charger, and used first time this year yesterday, 15 Apr 2012. Worked great and ran for more than 3 1/2 hrs but very costly. Considering the current prise of RL550 mower, the price of the battery was worth it."
5,Great Book!,"My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this book. She has 4 other leapstart books, but always chooses this one. She has used it so much that it is now starting to fall apart. She takes it everywhere she goes, even has to sleep with it. She also enjoys listening to her daddy read it to her before bed! Can't say enough about this book-recommend!"
1,Condition,"I bought this product because it was intended to be a gift. With the folded arms it's easy for transport and storage, I get it. So I figured my little brother would love it. I opened the taped up USPS package and there it was. The product was in a blue plastic case and it reeked of oil. I proceeded to open the blue package and noticed the grease stains all over the lug wrench. What makes it worse is that ""UCOSTORE"" charges for return shipping! I wouldn't have been so upset if I didn't pay $ 20 for a USED product.I gave it one star for prompt delivery."
3,Amazon Purchase,Textbook was received in the condition expected based on seller's comments. Shipping occured quickly and textbook was received well before estimated delivery date indicated. I felt the item was pricey for a paperbook though. Thank you.
1,unedible,"I had great hopes for these - I even spoke with the makers of the bars, they called asking me some questions. I can't find the info to call them back and let them know, but these tasted like they had gasoline in them, an incredibly chemical taste, blech. I've had lots of sugar free chocolate so I have a good amount to compare to. These tasted horrid to me. I hate to say don't buy them because I'm sure they'd taste different to different people, but they're definitely not for me."
2,What's inside matters too,"Are you one of those who only 'test-drive' the first few tracksof a CD before buying? Be warned: this album goes downhill right afterthe third number. If you are still keen on getting this CD, make sure you know what you're paying for by starting your sampling from track 4 instead. Rating: *one star for the first three tracks *another star for the (gorgeous) inlay card design"
1,Not a great musical moment.,"There are records you have to listen to several times before you get completely hooked up. Anyone that says the contrary isn't sincere. I have listened to this album several times (first impression wasn't great) and I just can't find anything particularly seducing or catchy in it. Tracks one and two are just ""o.k."", but then, each track is linear. You listen to 30 seconds and you know what the other 4 minutes are going to be like... That goes on from track 3 to track 10. Just listen to track 7 for instance and listen to the lyrics : ""all my love is just for you, all my love is just for you, all my love is just for you....."". All this makes of this album one of the less relevant in its genre released during 1999. Unfortunately for the Braxton Brothers, who look like they're good fellas.If you really want a good sax in this style, go to Gerald Albright or even Kirk Whalum. And a bass ? well, Marcus Miller, Brian Bromberg, etc."
1,some good stories by no means the best,"While this collection offers a wide selection many of the pieces are not specifically related to boxing such as Ralph Ellison's piece which is about a fight, but has nothing to do with the sport. For a collection that is focused on boxing itself, not just fighting, and recounts elements of the sport in detail and in a story formatt check out Katherine Dunn's latest work."
2,Bold Title Does Not Deliver.,With a title like this you would expect much more but it was a slow read. These are not the worst boxing stories ever told but they are not the greatest. I hate to be so critical but with a title like this the author must deliver.
3,"""Varied Boxing Stories""","Mediocre Read. Highlight is Frank DeFord's SI article on Billy Conn, originally titled the ""Boxer and The Blonde"". It helped that I had some knowledge of the subject matter. My Father knew Billy Conn's Father-in-Law, and I visited the Funeral Home when Billy was laid out. Also of interest was the script from the ""I coulda been a contendah"" Cab scene from ""On the Waterfront"". Of lesser or no interest were excerpts from the ""Illiad and the Odyssey"" and 1700/1800 fights. I really would not recommend this book to anyone, including hardened fight fans."
5,The Best Annie's variety!,"For some reason, no local store stocks this variety of Shells and Cheddar. Simply delicious because of the yummy basil!"
2,NO,NO FEING WAY WAT HAPPEN TO MEYGAN'S CUTE RED HAIR NOOOOOOOOOOOO IT CANT BE I LIKE HOW MEYGAN LOOKS BUT HER HAIR IT SUCKS!!!
2,bghyj,you know meygan with brown hair but it not her this doll is the real leah the spring brake one actually lille isn't it amazing
2,not so tough,What happened to this band? What happened to the creative energy that produced fox base alpha and so tough????
2,St. Etienne disappoints.,"As a long-time fan of the wonderful St. Etienne, I was disappointed to find that Places To Visit is just a collection of 'better-left-in-the-studio' tracks. Of course I will listen to it ad infinitum as I do everything by the band, but nevertheless, I had hoped for at least one or two stand-out tracks. Oh well."
2,Skip it.,"This album just isn't that good. I am guessing the only people who are considering this album are big St. Etienne fans, like me.There is basically one good song on here. Otherwise, this album is ok for background music you would play over drinks, but only if you don't really care what you're listening to.I tried to like this album, but the songs are pretty underdeveloped. I would bet, the remnents of most of these will show up with lyrics in their next full-length album."
3,Saint Etienne - Places To Visit,"Not the strongest tracks from Saint Etienne here on their EP, PLACES TO VISIT. The whole affair seemed too low-key for me, from the rather aimless openers ""Ivyhouse"" and ""52 Pilot"" and the closer ""Half Timbered"" to the wan house of ""We're in the City."" ""Artieripp"" is interesting at first, but seems like an interlude that's been stretched a bit too far. On the other hand, ""Sadie's Anniversary"" has some charm in its spare arrangements. This is an EP of throwaways, but it's worth noting that throwaways from Saint Etienne are still hand and shoulders above the belaboured pop on the radio."
1,I take my last Review Back. Spout Broke Off,"I am leaving my last review below. BOY WAS I WRONG. The spout broke off after about a month or two, shoddy welding. I tried to get a replacement but I never even heard back from the seller, EVER! Unfortunately, this is going to the landfill. EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK. I hope the seller sees this and next time responds.This is me being naive.This thing is really well built, it will last forever. I use it for a dish soap dispenser. It looks great on the counter and it's super easy to refill since the mouth is so big. My last dispenser was a glass bottle oil dispenser and it was really difficult to refill and would fall out of my hands all the time since it was slippery that does not happen with this one. So I am happy. It was pricey but I will never have to buy another so less stuff in the landfill."
1,"Robin McKinley, you missed your mark this time...","wow I found this book a major disappointment. I am a short-story fanatic usually, but i could not even get through all of the stories in this book. The stories lacked character definition and were utterly unoriginal.I would recommend Outlaws of Sherwood, also by McKinley, instead."
3,Robin Mckinley,"Robin McKinley is a very powerful man with magic. The author is Peter Dickinson. It was at a house.It was so night you couldn't spy thing.All of the boys and girls were going to plan to go to a Robin's house. The friends that were coming over were going to tell tales. The problem was the boys and girls wouldn't going to be able to go. Robin is a magical of the Earth. No one believes that right? That is why in page `'20'' it said it was called the ``The Water Tales of Elemental spirits!'' The characters were Charity Goodrich, Robin, Mercy, Simon Naismith, Bennett, Hooke, Warrens, and Lyalls. It is entertaining for a young child to read. This book is great, because of it gives you details and explains how the book called `' Robin McKinley'' is related to another book they wrote. The characters do fit in the story, because this book is really creepy, and so the names were high -quality for the story."
5,A Dash of Cold Water on the Face,"This book struck me a blow across the mouth when I first read it, and I've grown in appreciation of it on subsequent readings. These are not pretty stories, but neither are they squalid; they are sometimes slow, sometimes difficult, sometimes piercing, all chilly and wet. These mermaids have sharp fins and keen calls, and it is an extremely refreshing shock to read both authors' contributions to the book. As I have time, I will be reading more of Peter Dickinson, whom I had not read previously. This is a simply good book."
3,Not bad,"I don't really like short story collections, as I always find them hard to get into. I had the same problem with this book. The writing wasn't bad, and I even got into a few of the stories (the Mckinley ones) but I had a tough time finishing the book. I don't know. The stories were original and definitely worth reading for fans, but if you don't like water or Robin Mckinley, don't read it! I guess I thought it was just okay, and I probably won't reread it any time soon. And I don't plan on reading anything else by Dickinson."
4,Great Leap Pad book,"My kids love the leap pad system & books. They are a lot of fun & successful at educating them. The Magic School Bus series is always fun. The only drawback is that the Leap Pad itself has occassional quality issues. It ""gets confused"" and it's not an issue w/ the batteries or the cartridges."
1,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would.","Besides lacking substance, the book was poorly written. Apparently the author feels that in order to reach young people, he has to write like one. Someone with an Ivy League education should write at a level higher than that of a high school student. He also writes about people who save the world while he himself does nothing. It seems that people do it for him and he takes credit for by writing a book or by signing checks (as Sierra Club president). The book should be titled: ""While I sit back watching...""."
2,Title doesn't fit,"While Adam Werbach's book may suggest actions and strategies, it fails to. It gives insight into Adam's ""interesting"" take on certain campaigns, but leaves the reader dumbfounded how to go about activism. Not worth it."
2,HOW HOW HOW!!!!?????!!!,"Adam!Please tell us HOW we can become an activist like you! Act now, Apologize Later is a great title (which is why you got 2 stars instead of 1), but you just go on and on about what YOU did, but don't give steps HOW you did it. Arrgghhhh....."
3,The joyous voice of youth,"A brash, upbeat first shot from the (then) youthful president of the Sierra Club, this book makes up in verve for what it sometimes lacks in writing strength. Werbach, who assumed the helm of our oldest environmental juggernaut at age 23, entirely changed Sierra's attitude and style, if not their mission. This is the story of how that happened and where he now intends to go. From a staid (and often greying) presence working within the corridors of power now emerges community organizing, with young troops following Werbach into the trenches to save rivers and wetlands, register voters and assault the corporations and power brokers who stand in the way. Werbach makes an enthusiastic case for radical localism as the next wave in environmental restoration."
1,perhaps his accomplishments have gone to his head...,"One star for being motivational to young people...but overall, extremely disappointing. Adam is without double an accomplished individual. But for someone who has achieved so much in life at such a young age, his writing is very superficial. The book fails to truly educate people on environmental issues and appears to be nothing but a promo for his own accomplishments. Instead of fairly presenting both sides of the story, Adam's book is just a rehash of extreme environmentalist philosophy. He does not encourage people to think for themselves, to do research on issues they believe in or to look at issues from different perspectives. It really sets a poor example for today's youth."
3,Has interesting sub-stories,"I had to read this book for my college English class. I don't really care to read a story about someone's fight to save our plant, so it didn't hold any interest for me. I enjoyed reading more about his biography than I did about his quest to save the environment. Overall, it was an ""ok"" book to have to read for school."
3,"Two standout songs, but not enough else","This album features two brilliant songs: For Future Generations and Measure of a Man. Both songs have strong and inspirational lyrics and lively and catchy music. The other songs on this album were disappointing, though; see if you can find other recordings of the two standouts."
5,Can't seem to get tired of it!,"Unlike some, I have NOT been a 4HIM fan for years. In fact, I basically stumbled onto them while listening to a local Christian radio countdown that featured their songs. That small exposure was enough to prompt me to buy this CD...and I have never regretted it.Their musical talents are obvious, from their catchy tunes to their heartfelt lyrics, the instrumentation is superb. But best of all, their music just makes you feel good, whether you're a ""die-hard"" Christian or not. There is universal appeal in their messages and a timelessness that will keep me listening to them most likely for the rest of my life. Highly recommended."
4,"Well, not ALL the Best Ones","Don't get me wrong here, BEST ONES was a great album, but I felt that they had too many songs from THE MESSAGE on there. I would have left songs from THE MESSAGE off since it did come out just before this one. I was also surprised that ""When It Comes to Living"" wasn't on there. The album was good in that it collects a lot of songs that made 4 Him great and it adds a long missing addition to their CD lineup (that is, they've need a compilation album for a while...now if they'd just make a live album), but it wasn't all the BEST ONES."
5,This is the best book on Texas Hunting and fishing ever.,thgis is a great book about Bob Bristors life while hunting and fishing and has some great stories like granfathers Geese which I thought Was the best of all the stories but I also liked Big Red Buffelhead
5,Excellent reference book!!!!!!!,"If you are in the telecom or IT industry or just want to familiarize yourself with terminology and practices relating to both, YOU MUST OWN THIS BOOK! A lot of the definitions are understandably technical but Harry Newton manages to be very informative AND amusing with his casual, down-to-earth writing style."
5,A Must Have,"This is the book for those of us who get caught up in acronym soup. Easy, concise, detailed, and easy to use."
3,Its ok,"Used it for a class, but some of the definitions in this book were out of this world. Made for a good laugh. If you have it, look up flasher..."
5,important tool,This book is invaluable for anyone in the medical field who wants to communicate in sign. The medical term is defined and then how to sign the word is described in words as well as illustrated in diagrams. The diagrams are fairly easy to follow even if you aren't very good at translating things into three dimensions from 2 dimensions. I am very glad I bought this book.
5,"Very fine student flute, love that curve!","I'm not a professional player but a long-term amateur who's owned and played lots of flutes. I got one of these used because it just seemed to play itself. I said ""I'll take it"" -- then, I was handed the case, with the curved head in it. I tried that too, and it's a revelation. Very much eases shoulder strain for anyone with that problem (although it's intended mainly for small children). This is a very sweet sounding flute and very easy to play. Well made, too."
3,Yawn.,"This book seemed to have a lot of potential and I was excited to read it. However, Updike's incessant name dropping of varying 20th Century abstract expressionist painters (that had little relevance to the story except as background participants), his lofty prose and seemingly implanted facts about the cultural significance of the art of this movement became tedious and downright boring at times. I wasn't reading this book as a substitute for an Art History class I was reading this book to be told an engaging and insightful story. I feel like I got neither. The characters of Hope and Kathryn, to me, were blanks. Forward moving action in the story was nil, and Updike chose to use flashbacks in lieu of any kind of plot construction. The next time I feel like reading a book about art and its constituents I'll make sure to go to the reference section and NOT the fiction section."
1,Shouldn't be sold by Amazon!,"Prior to ordering, I read some reviews that said this product was not equivalent to the ""same product"" in the stores. But, because I trust the products sold by Amazon, I went ahead and tried. The price was just too good! Well, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is...and that expression was never truer than with this product. Each cartridge lasted about 1/4 of the time that the ""same"" cartridge from the store worked...and there were print quality issues throughout the short lives of both cartridges, as well.I've seldom regretted a purchase from Amazon, but this is definitely the exception! Amazon, how do I get my money back on this? It is definitely not worthy of your name. And how can a product that is so obviously inferior to the identically packaged ones in the store be allowed to sell?"
4,Wrong Item,Received the wrong item. The twinpack I received was a #96/97 HP Twinpack. The person we talked to by phone said that we could get this direct from Amazon. I'm not sure of that but after driving 26 miles round trip to buy a cartridge from WalMart so I could ptint a return label I'm sure I won't order from Infinite Surplus again. The first order we received from them was a Tripack and all the cartridges were loose in a package. They obviously don't hire people that can read or recognize numbers or care.
3,I hope it will work...,"I bought this item, but haven't got the change to use it yet. I bought it as a backup, and it's not emty yet. But usual when I buy HP original ink, it works!"
4,HP Color Toner,"What can I say? HP toner products work wellon HP printers. I tried non-HP toners andprints were horrible. Downside, toners areexpensive. O well, conserve prints and do notset it on ""high quality"" prints unless needed."
4,tonerpals,"toner pals sells great merchandise well priced. But, their delivery is a bit slow and they do not provide tracking"
3,bitter sweet,it broke in a day. it was gorgeous and it shipped fast. it was the perfect weight but i guess not the perfect length. it was a birthday gift for a close friend and after working with it on for few hrs it broke. im so embarrassed. i wish they had posted the item with the length in addition to width.
2,A Colleran myself,"I have always known Lee Remick was once married to my Father's cousin Bill Colleran although I balked at the price of this Bio-Bibliography I am certain I will experience a sort of understanding from Lee.I look forward to writing a full review, once I finish this special ""Book"""
5,A wonderful mix of funk and latin jazz.,This is a wonderful albumn. I especially enjoyed the song Conga Clubbin. The music stirs your soul and willl leave you asking for more. ENJOY!!
2,"If you have the new EP and CD, you don't need this","""The Bird that You Can't See"" is the best track from The Apples in Stereo's latest album, ""The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone."" But the B-sides are readily available elsewhere, both on the ""Look Away"" EP, which was released before the album, and the Australian version of ""Her Wallpaper Reverie."" Both are decent tunes, but the ""Look Away"" EP is half the price of this single and provides more bang for your buck."
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful reprinting of the still images that make up the film La Jetée. It also contains the English and French scripts in accompaniment. Unlike all the versions of the movie that I've seen, these images are clear and not washed out. Looking at the images in a book also allows you to really see the details and to pick out more information than watching the film.If I had a complaint, it's that sometimes instead of printing a full page image, the authors (editors?) would to put multiple small images on a page. Sometimes it's used to good effect (showing ""movement"" buy letting you see a sequence all at once) and sometimes it just makes you squint."
2,Down in less than an hour!!!,I have an X41 tablet and recently bought this item from Amazon. The package arrived fine but the battery does not lost for more than 50 minutes!! I spend more time plugging my power chord in wherever I go than working with my laptop. Ridiculous!! I am now looking for a replacement.
5,Frostiana,"Although I heard some of the Frostiana at a Christmas concert, the Frostiana is not traditional Christmas carols. The music for ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" is mysterious and deep which is exactly the ambience Frost was describing. Any fans of Frost should find this collection of songs interesting as there are many moods expressed. The other songs are well delivered, but the ""Snowy"" stops my heart every time."
2,Waste of Cash,"i don't really know what i was expecting from this release but it was a complete let down. Granted, the models on the cover looked amazing; in my opinion, once the dvd started playing, it was a complete let down. i was led to believe this would be great quality, something compared to the Digital Playground Production type/style captured on dvd, but it wasn't. The music, models and entire theme was not worth the money i funded to own it. i would never recommend it to anyone."
4,Really good,"I love the way my boots look and I have gotten so many compliments. However, if you wear them for a long time, your sole starts to hurt. I think its because the boot bottom is thin but other than that, they are great. I went dancing for NY eve and that is when I noticed they hurt just a little. But they look great."
1,Leather or Plastic?,"These boots are advertised as leather but the uper patches are man made. Feels like I'm wearing a pair of rubber boots. On the flip side, the arch and heel are perfect... Just disappointed that Bandolino would not make a full leather boot and that Amazon has not properly communicate the specs."
4,Good and cheap.,"I like cheap sunglasses, because I always break them. Losing $15 is a lot better than losing $500. Of course, it can be said that if I spent $500 on sunglasses, I might take better care of them. The thing is, I don't really want to babysit my sunglasses.When I was on a rocky ferry ride on my travels, these slipped off the top of my head (one of my storage places) and fell to the floor. One of the lenses had popped out, but not broken. The frame was also not broken. I was able to pop it back in and use them again. It happened again later on, and I repeated the process. Pretty amazed the lens and the frame didn't break."
3,"Fast shipping, nice looking product, but much bigger than anticipated","I ended up returning these because they were larger than I expected them to be. They are the type of glasses that go from the top of your eyebrows down to your cheekbone and then out to about the end of the hollow of your eyes. I am a fan of big glasses but it was jsut a little too much for my taste. However, the glasses were nice, and felt sturdy enough, and came quickly, so if you like glasses that big they may be for you!"
5,Great Buy,"I love these glasses! I always buy lower priced sunglasses because they seem to get broken easily but not on purpose. All the other ones I have had haven't fit as good as these do and didn't have UVA/UVB protection. I have a smaller face so I don't like to go too oversized because it makes me look really funny. These were the perfect size for me and my older brother says they look ""very expensive and like I'm hiding from paparazzi."" Definitely recommend and I really like the color!"
3,not what I was looking for,"I was excited for these glasses because everyone talked about how big they are. I'd say they're large, but I was looking for truly oversized glasses. The fit is also uncomfor table. I feel like I'm wearing goggles because the frames push up against my face everywhere. I'm keeping them because I live in Hawaii and just broke my favorite glasses. I am anxious to replace these glasses though."
5,Great for the price!,"These sunglasses are great for the price! They are definitely over-sized, so be sure you want a large frame. I love the style and they are very comfortable. I received the order in a few days and it was packaged well so as to avoid damage during transit."
1,Too Big,"I expected big lenses, but it turns out the top of the frames around the eyes go a couple centimeters above my eye brows."
2,Not what I expected,"Received the sunglasses two days before the estimated scheduling date. Looking at the picture, the lenses are a smoky black, but the sunglasses that I received are a rose color so I sent them back."
1,HUGE!!!,"I had no idea how enormous these sunglasses would be. They cover half of my face. The seller was quick and the product was a good quality, but I don't recommend these sunglasses to anyone unless you're trying to completely hide your face."
2,Not oversize,These glasses are not oversized and would not buy them again. They are the color they say although the size is not what one wou;d consider near oversize.
5,Great sunglasses,I needed a new pair of inexpensive sunglasses and found these on Amazon. They arrived quickly and were exactly what I was looking for. I will be buying from them again!
3,Another Pair of Sunglasses,"I'm on a search for the ""perfect"" pair of sunglasses; look good, provide maximum eye protection and comfortability. This particular pair look great, but don't fit properly, so I was disappointed."
1,Do not like the sunglasses,I thought these sunglasses were going to be more like shades but the tint is very light and looks more like glasses. I was not happy with the product. I did like the white ones but not the black/amber pair.
3,"funny fit, but worth the price","I have had large sunglasses before, but these ones have a different fit, so I ended up looking like I have a really small face (not the case). They do the job though - I bought them to replace the sunglasses I wear while driving, so looking my best is not really a concern on my way to work. Good find for the money."
4,Classy look!,These glasses look great on. They are not name brand quality but still look very nice on and I have received many compliments.
4,I feel like Jackie O!,These sunglasses are great. Good coverage and very stylish. I got them in both frame colors. My only wish is that they came with a glasses case. They are tough to transport. I am afraid of scratching them.
2,Amber lens too light,"The amber lens are too light, appear darker than they actually are. Maybe good for driving in the fog?"
2,look good but have downsides,"These glasses look really nice, but they are uncomfortably heavy and barely tinted, so the sun still hurts my eyes when I drive."
4,Nice Shades,Great price and the sunglasses are great. Even thou they are lighter than I would like them to be but they keep the sun out of my eyes. Shipping was fast also.
5,love them!,"These shades are comfortable, stylish, and a great price! I would definitely recommend them to anyone of any age! Btw I bought the brown pair and they even look good if i wear black."
4,"Like the style, but not very durable","I really like the look of these sunglasses, but after having them for only a few weeks I sadly managed to break them. To be fair, it was my fault and I stepped on them, but they snapped in half *immediately*, before anything close to my full weight was on them. I wish they had survived..."
4,Sunglasses,I love these sunglasses. I recently broke the pair I had for over ten years and was very happy when I found theses. I ordered the first pair and they quality is great. Plus they are exactly like my old ones! I just ordered four more!
3,Okay while they lasted...,I bought these for summer vacation. I wanted a cute pair that were cheap in case I lost them. I wore them less than ten times before the arm broke on one side.
3,Seriously Oversized,"These shades are okay. They're very large and round, as well as very retro. Good for when you're being incognito. I call them my Jackie Onasis shades. :)"
5,A Diva is a Female Version of a Hustla!!!,I love these! My husband has to get used to them because I am SO gonna be rocking these all summer! I got them in the White/Smoke and have tan skin [I'm a mix girl lol] These make me feel super fab; like others have said: A superstar...even if I'm chilling on a private beach area! Too Glam! I love them! The price is fantastic and they shipped SUPER fast!
3,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased two pairs of these glasses to replace expensive sunglasses that my 4 year old threw at the bottom of a lake. The quality isn't spectacular (one pair has chipped enamel) but they are good enough to keep the sun out of my eyes and look half decent. They're worth what I paid , (about six bucks)"
3,Definitely oversized!!,If you are looking for huge glasses these are for you. I kept them because they were cheap and I use them for walking/exercising. I got the black with the lighter lenses and I don't particularly care for the lense color because you can see your eyes through the lenses. I may order the black with darker lenses.
5,A happy customer,"As soon as I opened it, I was so ecstatic to try them on.And when I did I was so happy that they looked fabulouslyDesigned and they felt comfortable.:) So glad I purchased them."
1,Sometimes you get what you pay for.,These glasses were not wearable because the arms are crooked and uneven. They sit lopsided on my face - so lopsided that my husband and I both started laughing when I tried them on. I have attached a picture so you can see them sitting on a flat surface. There's no way to correct it without breaking the arm. I guess that's the risk you take when you order glasses online.
5,"Demonstrates the negative consequences of bullying, and offers a positive alternative through self-empowerment and esteem","The subject of dealing with bullies is the focus of Alley Oops, an entertaining and superbly written picturebook written by Janice Levy and illustrated by Cynthai Decker for young readers ages 5 to 9. The story follows young Patrick as he repeatedly encounters a name-calling bully at school - J.J. Jax, who labels him ""Pig-Pen"" and ""Porky"". When Mr. Jax learns of this, he tells J.J. a story about the days long ago when he was once a bully. Mr. Jax explains that everyone has two dogs inside - one bad and one good - and whichever dog we feed the most will win the battle. Ally Oops demonstrates the negative consequences of bullying, and offers a positive alternative through self-empowerment and esteem, which can be used to build lasting connections of true friendship. Very highly recommended."
3,Could've been SO much better,"There are a lot of good moments on this CD. Some parts of ""Driving the Last Spike"", all of ""Dreaming While You Sleep"", and instrumental parts of ""Living Forever"" and ""Fading Lights"". However, because of the fact that Genesis's image in the early 90's was pure pop, it seems as if they began to try to sound like a pop band. Banks's main synthesizer, which wasn't all that great sounding in the first place, is almost completely droned out by Collins's voice. Also, I'm sure that Steve Hackett would never use a guitar that sounded like Rutherford's guitar on this album. It was too soft sounding, which led to soft-sounding songs (""Never a Time"", ""Hold on My Heart"", ""Since I Lost You"", etc.). It's a shame, because songs like ""No Son Of Mine"", ""Jesus He Knows Me"", and even ""Way of the World"" would probably sound much better with rock-sounding instruments rather than pop-sounding instruments. All in all, it's still probably worth whatever the price tag says it's worth."
1,I can do without this one,"I hate to give albums one star, especially from a band that I love so dearly, but this one was pretty weak. There were two decent songs here, Fading Lights and Driving the Last Spike, not the greatest thing they've ever recorded, but still not bad.But overall, this album's pretty boring. Makes very nice background music, I'll give it that. But there really is nothing of note hear. There is an over-abundance of sappy love songs and various elevator music filler. It's hard to believe, from listening to this album, that Genesis was once an edgy prog rock band."
2,Enough of Genesis,"Why did Banks and Rutherford insisted again with Calling all Stations, I'll never know. The band took five years since Invisible Touch to record We Can't Dance, and if this was the result, it should have been obvious there were no reasons to stay together. Not that I dislike Genesis' radio hits phase -in fact, I'd go with Duke or Abacab anytime over the old, pompous symphonic-ish rock albums. But WCD is tired, dull pop, the kind it gets worn out after a few weeks of radio exposition. A pity. But it seems that Genesis -like most bands- couldn't help the temptation to go on just a little too long."
1,genestinks,The music here has no difference between the songs. They're all sappy whether they are about love[which is the worse] or about whatever he wants to whine/sing about. His upbeat songs are overly emotional and too crazy. Phil Collins has better rythmn in his songs. If you want to hear some real singing check out Phil's album But Seriously or Both Sides.
4,"They Can Dance, Genesis's White album","In some ways, this is the Genesis White Album. It contains 50% killer songs and even a few modern prog classics ""Last Spike"" and ""Fading Lights"" it also has about 50% filler too but overall it's a good enjoyable record and one of their better efforts in retrospect, a great way to end an era."
5,Great album from one of the greatest bands ever.,"Firstly. I just can't understand these guys who give 1 star to this album?=D Even if you only like prog. There are no bad songs in this album. Few unbeliavable breathtaking songs: No son of mine, Driving the last spike, Dreaming while you sleep and Fading Lights.I just want to hear these again and again."
1,boring beyond belief,"This is boring stuff...music without inspiration...Collins is so insincere. The title song is such a dumb tune, it makes me sick. Genesis has died."
1,Triying to Be Experimental...,"It's clear that Genesis will never be what they were before. But they sometimes try to make some experiments which don't work, basically because they are contaminated with commercial pop. Make longer songs and adding more keyboards and programmings would not make them become the avant-garde group they were one time. Maybe they should try something different on this record, if they (seemed to be) so ashamed of the commercial success of ""Invisible Touch"" (they really were?)."
2,Aye yai yai!,"Okay I KNOW I'm gonna get a lot of ""not helpful"" votes on this one, but let me just say that ""I Can't Dance"" is the only song ever made that can make me actually physically ill while I'm listening to it. It's THAT bad! How this album sold a million copies the same year as the Replacements broke up due to ""lack of popularity"" is one of the gravest injustices in rock n roll."
1,"Stupid title track, stupid video, bad record",I haven't heard this entire monstrosity in a long time but the title track is enough to make me run full speed and you should too. It may not be fair because there may be some hidden gems here but I'm not going to risk it because of that incipid title tune and its even worse video. This doesn't even deserve the name of Genesis on it.
1,What happened to Genesis,"Where have you gone Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel? Phil Collins ruined Genesis. How can they go from ""Nursery Cryme"" to this crap?"
2,2nd longest,We Cant Dance at 70 minutes is the 2nd longest Genesis album only shorter then The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (which is 85 minutes) but somehow thats not saying much. Still this manages to be a 2 1/2 star album along with And Then There Were Three putting it slightly over the other 4 albums Genesis made as a Phil Collins led trio. Longer more complex compositions with stronger playing attribute to this. The Last Spike and Fading Lights are classic Prog Rockers while No Son Of Mine and Living Forever are good and I Cant Dance and Jesus He Loves Me are ok. The rest of this album is awfull even at the end of thier stint with Collins Trio Genesis failed to even make a good album.
1,The worst after invisible touch,"This is not Genesis! , just Collins and Friends using the name , Hold on my heart is a ballad Michael Jackson style only not that good ! , and that is not the worst song !If you like Genesis , the real one , Seconds Out era , this is not for you , if you like In too deep , paperlate, Invisible Touch and other abominations then go ahead."
2,Like A Clock Winding Down,"It was a great 20 year plus run for the band, but this album shows that like most bands, they hung around one album too long.There are some good moments, but the album's length (which by the way makes it almost impossible to get through in one sitting) makes it very difficult to sustain any momentum. Plus, there's ""Jesus, He Knows Me,"" the only serious challenger to ""Illegal Alien"" as the worst Genesis song ever."
5,Back to -83,"This album is about 10 times better than Invisible Touch. It mixes pop and the older music style of Genesis greatly, like the ""Genesis"" album in 1983. I guess people who did not like the ""Mama-album"", don`t like this either, but for me this is a really great album, one of Genesis best."
5,great genesis album,"we cant dance is a great album from the rock legends banks,rutherford and phil collins.this album is as good as genesis's self titled album or the lamb lies down on broadway.thanks"
1,Can't handle the cold weather,"Interestingly enough, this may be the only GPS made for hiking and the outdoors on the market that develops hypothermia. If I leave my Explorist 400 outside overnight in my truck and start it when it is cold (cold being a relative term - I am in Georgia - we're only talking the 30's) it loses its mind. It shows that there are no maps loaded, and that essentially the SIM card is empty."
3,Non Fiction,"This text does not tell you a whole lot if you know what you are doing already. However, if you are not familiar with the basics of probability, or how bookmakers have an edge, or what the sensible things to do are when looking for odds to be on a sporting event, then this book is not too bad a thing to have read. When punting, something that gives you one useful fact can of course be worth a lot of money."
2,Not all that good,"Take away the charts,this book is almost useless. Not impressed with it at all. For beginnners with less than 1 year of wagering experience only."
3,"Simple sport beting guide, not a 'money making' guide","This book is just a simple compilation of an average bookie's 'rules and tips'. It's useful only when you just newbie in betting/online betting, then it will be yours 'The first complete guide to betting'. I don't think that an expereinced gambler will find something new in it. Some rules of betting (US sports oriented), odds definition, introduction to online gambling - the only information you will find in it."
3,Good first effort..,"I think that this book would have benifitted greatly from a good editing, but still found it easy to read and follow. I'm no post-Nero historian, but found the plot plausible and the characters mostly likable(if underdeveloped), although the dialog often seemed forced. I'll read the second one and hope to see improvement in these areas. All in all, I would recommend it..."
1,Banel dialog - lacking in historical accuracy,"I've read many historical novels set in Roman history, without a doubt this is the worst. Although I love reading these type of novels, this one was so bad I finally gave up about halfway through. With all due respect to the other reviews, this is one of the most ridiculous excuses for a book that I have ever had the sad experience to encounter. Just awful!!"
5,A soldier's view of history and politics,"From Korea, when he is encircled and captured by the Chicoms to the halls of the Pentagon, from the Panama invasion to Israeli spying, to Carter's cold reception at the White House, Sumner tells it like it is. This slim volume is a sucker punch to the gut of conventional wisdom. Read it if you dare."
5,Musical answer to my prayers,"What a superb album. Everything is as it should be. Atardecer continually sounds fresh listen after listen. There is no fluff here, and the album is short and sweet...a very cohesive and concise offering. The mood of the album is perhaps summed up best as that of twilight longing. One of the best things is the lack of a singer...the music is gloriously free of any whining or personal introspection...rather it opens itself up to the listener as a personal soundtrack...or soundscape. It's a shame that fine intrumental music does not command the audience that it did in the days of jazz. I especially recommend this to those of you who drive long distances alone in the dark. This music is haunting and gorgeous. Get it!"
3,Mountains of Nortena,"This CD contains some good music. Sometimes it's heavy and sometimes it's trippy. A lot of work went into it, I think. It's not bad and deserves a listen if you like adventurous music."
3,Very Small,"ordered this for my son, thinking he could at least hold it like a pistol. nope its like 9 inches long and for display only. its a nice replica but isnt for cosplay or any play."
3,Not what I expected,"When I first bought it I didn't read it well enough and didn't realize that it wasn't a life size replica of Squall's Gunblade, so when I got it in the mail today, I was surprised to see a little bitty gunblade with a stand in a box and so I was a little disappointed but its great for show and for people who love to have things out for display purposes only and for final fantasy fans such as me. so if you want to get it go ahead its very cute. I put it on display in my room its great for collectors but not great for cosplay like I wanted it for at first. Overall its great for display but if you want to find a life size replica gunblade for cosplay purposes, you will have to look elsewhere if there is one at all."
3,this is a square enix product,OK. People this is the minatures put out by square enix. why can't people just say that. minaturs are small but nice and do functionas the spexs say. any final fantasy enthuasist would have seen them for sale at the any video game store or anime outlet. they were sold for 34.95 at the store so 18.00 is not bad at all. ordered on friday of last week got them on thursday of the following that with regular shipping.they did mess up my ship ment i wanted the cerberus but got a key blade but there all buy the same company and the same price. so i'm gonna just keep it. they are nice for minatures. if your looking for close to real size replica keep looking this is not it.
2,Squall's Gunblade - it is what it is.,"The item itself is not exactly what I expected, but it did arrive within good time and a mere week later the same item was available from a UK website for a marginally lower price and with free shipping (but that's my own fault for not waiting and shopping around a little).It is quite a small item for the price, but if you're into collecting all things 'Final Fantasy' then this will probably not look out of place in such a collection."
4,Her First Lp Recording,"Originally released by Discuba Records in 1960, this is La Lupe's first ever studio recording, titled, ""Con El Diablo Por Dentro"". It showcased La Lupe's affinity for singing boleros and american rock ballads (sang in spanish), and later in her carreer, done in english too. Among the selections, the Davenport-Cooley's rock ballad ""Fever""(sang in spanish), is La Lupe's first version of it. Years later it became a hit, when she recorded it in english. Also, the Facundo Rivera's bolero, ""No Me Quieras Asì"", was also a hit, as she used to perform it facing a wall, promting some fans to change the title of the tune to, ""La Pared""(""The Wall""). Important Note: The quality of the recording is at best somewhat poor, but nevertheless, taken from an historical context, one can hear and appreciate a young La Lupe(21 yrs.old), as she went on to become a star singer in her own right. Enjoy."
4,Great Puzzle,Kids have been playing with this puzzle since Christmas of 2011 and they love them and they are still going strong.
2,Not my favorite,Thankfully this was not the first CD I bought by this artist - it was not a big hit with me. The work on this album can not compare to the other CD's he has released since. His other CD's have converted me to country music and convinced me that Tracy Lawrence is the very best. He has only improved over time- - like a fine wine!
3,Worthless without the DVD ...,The book comes with a DVD that you need to do the cardio component of the method. Don't waste your money on the kindle instead buy the book.
4,Tracy Anderson's 30 Day method,"This is a great book. While I was not looking to lose weight, after a few days I noticed a change in my physique. I love her concept of a dancer's body. Following her exercise plan of cardio and then the exercises has been hard work but worth it! My goal is to be firm and lean is working out. The only part I dislike is that in order to achieve results, a certain amount of repetition is required. So it is hard work. I would recommend this book to people who want to get firmer without bulking up."
2,Seriously painful,"This may be a great workout if you're under 30, already in great shape, and pretzel-flexible. If you're not, you might want to skip this one.I'l try just about anything once; this had enough good reviews that I thought it couldn't hurt. I'd read enough to be pretty sure the diet was for the birds (too expensive, too closely resembling anorexia), so that was a non-starter. I tried the mat workout, thinking at worst, it wouldn't do anything for me. WRONG. Five days into the first 10-day segment, my hips were killing me. I mean, they hurt to the point that I had trouble sleeping. Hmmm. Not good.I'm going to give myself a few days to recover. I like a few of the mat moves. I'm pretty sure I'll like a few more with some modifications. And I'm pretty sure I'll never like some of them. In that sense, this isn't a whole lot different from most other workout books.Bottom line: Not a complete waste of money, but be very careful."
2,Junk,Tracy says her plan is guaranteed to work. Eating very few calories and working out 2 hours a day (the premise of her program) will have that effect. But she also says to follow her plan to a T or else it won't work. Skip this book unless you plan on following her meal plans perfectly and working out 2 hours a day.
3,Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method,"30 day bootcamp book which included diet to follow and also has DVD. DVD very disappointing, very to follow exercises from DVD and she doesn't do all the reps so you have to keep stopping DVD."
3,Doctors needed...,"I am on day 3 of this method, and I threw up during dinner last night. I'm hypoglycemic and each day have felt my hypoglycemia coming on strong twice a day. I don't know whether I threw up because of my hypoglycemia or another reason, but I still am not feeling great. Yes, pounds come off right away. The stretches are fine, the muscle work is challenging and good, the dance aerobics are sometimes hard to follow and poorly edited but they are not too awful to do.My question is - should I stick to the diet or should I be eating more food? More frequently? I don't know what to do, but I don't want to spend the next month throwing up. I went on this to get a great body and to feel good and healthy, not to become bulimic."
2,If you live in lala land.,"The exercises are easy and you may be a little soar. However, anyone with a tight schedule will be unable to do the hour pluse that it takes to complete the workout. The DVD only shows the right side moves and you will definantly have to work and practice the moves before you are able to fit them in your routine. The dance/cardio part is hard to follow as she does not give any direction to what is next. tried to follow but just made my own routine with her moves to the count of 8. Now, if you have a chef come cook for you, it's no problem; but if you are on a budget (like me) you cannot find most of the products the recipe calls for; preptime; and servings are unrealistic. I was still hungary and just, resumed my Weight Watchers diet, easy and no fuss. Also my family was able to enjoy the same meal and I only had to cook dinner once. Inches lost NONE, Weight lost 5 lbs. and this was on a 30 day tryout."
3,The book is Ok...,"Personally I found the hard copy book quite unnecessary since it comes with a DVD illustration of how to do the moves...So u don't really need to read the book. Apart from that, the exercise program is great. I love the Dancing section. It's easier to do than those in traditional TA dancing DVDs.And yeah...I wonder who would really follow the diet plans ?!! I don't ! It's too much trouble to cook day-by-day meals like that (especially for only 1 person), except when u have someone else to do all the grocery shopping and cooking for u !"
1,This dies is detrimental to your health!,"I like Tracy Anderson's routines, but I am opposed to her dieting. Please read the following article:[ ... ]It explains the harm this type of diet can have on your organs and bones. It was very informative and people should take this seriously. Tracy is advocating for women to consume only 700 calories a day. It is not spelled out in the book, but a nutritionist examined her diet and calculated the daily caloric intake.I hope this helps!"
3,Tracy Anderson book,The book was in good shape but I was very disappointed that I didn't get the CD what came with the book.
2,very disappointed,"I bought this book and dvd because I love Tracy Anderson. However, I was extremely disappointed when I received the items. The cardio section of the dvd is very hard to follow and it is short. You have to keep replaying the segment to get a decent cardio workout. The toning segments are the same way. She shows you how to do the move then you have to press pause in order to complete the exercises on both sides of your body. I definitely like her other Method dvds much better."
3,"Good, but hard to stick too!","I have read a ton of diet and exercise books and this one has some new ideas about exercising. From every book I read I pick out what I like and add it to my life. The exercises in this book are interesting and different, but I think it is hard to commit to working up to 60 reps of each exercise. I also enjoyed the cardio portion of the video, but if you are not experienced in dance it may be difficult because she doesn't count or cue any of the moves. She switches from move to move sometimes doing a move 4x in a row and other times twice. It would make it easier if there was some consistency to the timing of the moves. I was a dancer so I was able to catch on and enjoy it but it may frustrate others! All and all I like her concept and ideas I am just not sure everyone is going to have the time to fit it all into their lives."
2,New to Tracy's Method? Get this book. Already familiar? Don't waste your money.,"This is a decent book for those who are completely new to Tracy Anderson and her program. If you already have some of the Tracy Anderson DVDs, don't waste your money on this book. Even for the DVD. The Dance Cardio on the book DVD is a joke - it is nowhere near as good as her Beginner Dance Cardio DVD for those who are new to cardio dance. Even if you are new to the TA Method, I would recommend that you buy her Beginner Dance Cardio DVD so you can learn some real dance cardio routines. If you have the patience and work ethic, her Dance Cardio II is even better - true dance routines that make you not even realize how hard you are working. And I am NOT a dancer!!"
3,"Philosophy and exercise plan is great, but meals take too much time","I love Tracy and have followed her exercise plan and overall philosophy for quite a while. I have been committed to doing her exercises for 1.5 hrs/ 4-5 days a week. I like the book for the exercise plan, but cannot do the meals. For a mom with two young kids, I am more apt to grab a Think Thin bar or make a smoothie, than cut up vegetables for an egg white omelet in the morning. I commend Tracy for her attempt to have real food in her menu plan, but in reality the rush of the day makes it impossible to create these meals. I think it would also be better if the ingredients were reused throughout the week so that if you buy chicken on Sunday, it can be used for several dishes throughout the week. This would make the prep time shorter and more economical."
1,What a joke.,"This boot camp is entirely unreasonable. The calorie intake for the amount of mat work and dance cardio you do is totally unhealthy. The menu is extremely time-consuming to make and way too expensive for the average person. The muscular structure work is do-able; I will most likely continue with this section. The dance cardio, however, is dangerous to do in your own home unless you have remodeled one of your spare rooms or basement into a dance studio. Warning: do not do the dance cardio on carpeting and be sure to wear the appropriate shoes (ie., not running shoes). I sprained my ankle the first time I tried the dance cardio workout, and believe me, I am no klutz. Like Miss Anderson's other material, this book and DVD are poorly edited and filled with inconsistencies. This whole 30-day boot camp concept is just not safe, healthy or convenient. Don't waste your money."
2,Not worth buying,The diet in this book is very unrealistic and will cost a lot of money and prep time. The work out seems good but your better off buying her DVD then this book
3,Used Version did not contain DVD,"My wife seems to like the book, but because it was missing the DVD, I'll probably have to buy the book new. I don't understand why the description doesn't mention the DVD that's supposed to be included."
4,Really works!,"This program really works if you are willing to dedicate yourself to it. I started at 5'5"", 149lbs, and I lost 11 pounds and several inches off my body by following the plan. I never felt hungry and the food is all extremely nutritious and very tasty. However, it requires a large time committment for grocery shopping, prepping meals, and exercising (2 hours/day)."
3,Tracy Anderson 30 Day method,I needed the exercises. They are working. It takes 2 hours. She does not teach the dance moves at all. The Dance video has to be played 4 times to total 40 minutes and is spliced together in weird places causing it to be hard to follow. One long one with no edits and instructions would be appreciated.
3,I got it for the DVD and to add variety,"Her clients are stars who look good - and I am guessing most of that is due to their good genes...but from what she says about her self, her method seems based on her personal journey and results...and I respect that BUT...she is a bit too fanatical for my taste. If you have to fight this hard and be so prohibitive to have a certain kind of body, I wonder how realistic your expectations are and how good the quality of life. I believe in moderation - but really strict diets don't do it for me - I wish to enjoy life and food.Another thing I don't care for is the subtle bashing she does of other fitness methods to make hers look better...and it comes off as erroneous and arrogant to me because the methods she eschews work for many and have always worked for many - AND science backs the insulted methods up...a little too focused on being as thin as possible I guess is the best way to sum it up. I highly doubt I will buy anthing else by her. But...never say never!"
2,High Profile (marketed) Advanced Calesthenics,"The book, philosophy and program is for already fit clients who are aerobically fit and physically strong enough to learn the routines AND/OR have a daily schedule that permits the level of commitment that is encouraged and required by the book. There must be a high level of commitment and time made by a client to this approach and the learning curve is steep. The 'warm up' stage (5 poses) could potentially cause injury only because the body isn't warmed up enough to do it safely (my opinion).Commitment and common sense is the key. This, like every other exercise or healthy routine, can be effective if one has a routine and practical workout schedule. The only '30' that is consistent for me is the 30 minute of aerobic activity before the workout that has kept me injury free with this product but, realistically, not every day and certainly not 30 days in a row."
5,method that really works,"I like Method of Tracy as it gives almost immediate visible result. Book explains the method itself, details of excersizes (as it matters!), includes low calorie but still interesting menu & is supported by DVD showing the workout."
2,This should be for UNDER 6!,"I was looking for something easy that my 9 year old could do that wasn't too complicated. This claims to be for over age 6, however, the 'tricks' are WAY to easy. Seriously, a four year old could do these with no prob. Also, the quality is terrible. The first time we used the sword in the stone the wood piece that holds the metal piece inside (that releases the sword) came off! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this at all, too cheap."
3,A very simple magic set,"Very simple set for a six year old - maybe too simple. The trick with the box and string that ""changes"" colors is pretty lame, since both string colors are visible at the start and end of the trick. The sword in the stone can be pulled out by a determined child without the ""magic"" ring. The other two tricks are better - very simple illusion tricks. My 6 and 8 year old love the set and are delighted to perform the tricks for anyone who will watch. I suspect they will quickly grow bored with it though as it is quite simple. I am more impressed with the magic set they make for 8+.The decorating on the set is cute. Except for the sword in the stone, I think it will last well. The box isn't useful for storing everything as it is open on the top and back."
2,Pretty good,"My 7 year old son really enjoyed it when he got it; but it has broken apart and he's lost some of the pieces. In general it was fun while it lasted, but once you do the tricks several times they start to get old. Worth it for an introductory to magic and limited time of usefulness."
4,Beautiful set for new magicians,"Like all Melissa & Doug toys, this all wooden set is gorgeous and sturdy. The magic tricks are not easy. They take some time to learn and practice to master. However, once your child gets the hang of it, my 6 year old really enjoyed doing his show. Yes, it is not a toy that is picked up every single day because you learn the trick and then it's done, but every so often when I ask for a magic show, he's glad to get out his set and perform for me. It teaches hand eye coordination as well as memorization skills. Set is definitely made to last and will easily be a toy he can play with for more than a couple of years."
4,Gift,Given to grandson as Christmas gift so he can showcase his many talents in magic and learn more about it
5,Fun!!,I bought three of these kits for Christmas gifts for my son's friends - ages 6 & 7. They LOVED it. Normally a kid's magic set is so flimsy and/or complicated that it's trashed within a week of receipt. Not this kit. In true Melissa & Doug fashion it is high quality and easy to use. The boys all are competing to see who can learn the tricks the fastest and amaze the most people. Great bargain as well.
4,Good for five year old,"My son went to a birthday party where they had a magician and he seemed really keen to do magic tricks himself. Most sets are geared for older kids, and require more complex understanding and hand coordination. This was perfect for him. I have to say that from an adult perspective, the 'tricks' are pretty funny as it is completely obvious what the trick is, but it is just the right level for him. The box says 6+, although my guess is that by 7 or so these tricks would seem too simple. I'm not sure if this is something he will play with for a long time, but it was the holidays, and this was a nice way to indulge a current interest."
4,My daughter loves this,She does the tricks for everyone she can. The construction is durable and the tricks are easy to learn and perform.
4,Culturally Enlightening,"I enjoyed this book because of the dynamics between the three or four main characters who show you the life of extreme poverty and desperation that is part of their everyday lives. This book is beautifully written with vivid descriptions and characters that I could grasp. While it's short, it tells an emotional story of a Mexican family who makes their modest living by picking fruit under the scorching sun. It is a tale for everyone, especially people in this country, to read and discover how other people are living their lives simply off the produce of the ground. Read this is you want to be culturally aware."
2,Meh,"I had to read this book for a class, and not being of Hispanic origin and not being a Spanish speaker; certain phrases, mannerisms ,and language overall were rather difficult to comprehend. The theme and the setting of the book are quite uninteresting for a 20-something year-old white male (or at least me , I'd hate to make an incorrect generalization). The publisher chose an incomprehensible format for dialogue in the text, and along with a lack of an actual story line, the read is quite a chore and not something I'd ever try to read again. I plan on avoiding anything Viramontes wrote in the future."
3,Not as comfortable as I expected,"Shoe reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. Everyone is different, and what one likes may not be liked by others. I have tried several shoes over years and try to change them. I did not find these Adidas as comfortable as others. For me Brooks Brothers have been very comfortable for me. In stores we can try shoes and then buy. In amazon, one relies on reviews and unfortunately i cannot give a 5 star to this shoe as it did not feel comfortable to me."
2,Dissappointing,"I purchased this with an expectation that Adidas brand stood for quality, but was dissappointed with how unsubstantive the shoe itself was. I believed it was on a sale price due to the color (a rather obnoxious orangy-red that my wife cringed at) and I was willing to live with for training in. But it think i would have been as comfortable and supported if I had strapped the shoebox to each foot."
4,good $40 pair of sneakers,"I bought these sneakers for $40, MSRP was around $100. They are not worth much more than $40. Good quality construction, true to size. Very good ventilation. When I drive while wearing them I get very good feedback from the pedals."
5,music that stirs my spirit,"At Hilo Hatties on Maui, I listened for the first time to this band at 20 seconds per cut. I liked it instantly and bought it and in the check out line the checker said I made a good choice. Back in California, I played it and I was hooked. What a wonderful sound that was almost intoxicating. I then bought the rest of their CDs and continue to listen endlessly to music that, to me, is refreshing, comforting, enjoyable and seemed almost spiritual. I am so happy to have discovered the Makaha Sons 30+ years after they began creating their distinctive music."
5,Good Service!,Just like the Blades that came with the vehicle originally - seamless! It's Nice When Your Fav Auto Dealer Installs Them for Free!
4,Does not fit 2007 Avalanche,Amazon said this was compatible with my vehicle. It is not. Do your homework on auto forums before purchasing. The product is fine otherwise. Build quality seems good.
5,Americans in Cuba,"The book is fantastic! I traveled to Cuba as a student for six weeks in 2003, and I am always looking for photos and literature that capture today's Cuba in the truest light. This is one of those...(FYI: It is only very recently that almost all travel for US citizens to Cuba has been restricted, and many people still manage to go illegally. Like I said, I went in 2003 as a student with permission from the US government...and now I search constantly for a way to go back, but so far I have not had any luck.)"
3,interesting,"Hey, how is it that all the reviewers are from the United States, where it's citizens are not allowed in Cuba? Just curious from someone in Canada who's been there."
1,POOR ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS,"THE ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS OR LACK OF WERE SO SMALL I NEEDED A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO READ THEM.THE TECHNICAL WRITER OR ENGINEER WHO WROTE THESE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD HAVE TRIED THEM BEFORE GOING INTO PRODUCTION. NOT USER FRIENDLY.THE HANDLE LOOKS TO BE VERY WEAK AND MAY EASILY BREAK, NOT THE BEST DESIGN OR QUALITY."
1,The three stars are for the first track only..........,"...........otherwise, forget this dreck. Latimer, as we could all too easily have guessed,is ths ONLY reason to buy this British garbage; the rest of it is only for for the trash."
2,RSVP International In-Sink Dish Rack,"I had to return because it didn't fit in the sink. It was too large, and I had measured the sink."
4,RSVP In-Sink Dish Rack,Speedy delivery and service on this prodict which I gave as a gift. It arrived in perfect condition and the person who is using it loves it as it does the job and does not take up any room.
4,"a fine product, just the wrong size","I clearly have a difficult size sink as this is the third dish drainer I've tried. Because the sides of my sink angle inward toward the bottom I have to use a very small drainer. Even with this small size, I can't use the utinsil holder. Aside from my sink causing me difficulties, this is a nice, well built drainer and if I were able to use the utinsil holder, I would probably like it even more."
4,Sturdy and functional,This dish rack is solid stainless steel. It's very sturdy. You can easily stack it high with plates and pots. It fits easily in one side of a standard sized double sink. The one flaw in the design is that I worry that my good knives will get dulled by the stainless steel dish rack.
5,Perfect Size!,This rack is the perfect size for the smaller side of a 60/40 sink. Its constructed well and should last quite a while. The product description was accurate and the price was reasonable. I would purchase again and obviously recommend!
3,TOO WIDE FOR MY SMALL SINK,"I like the in-sink dish rack. Too bad it is too wide for my sink. I have a double sink, one large and one small. I though it would fit.I just sent it back to Green Cupboards today, 1/8/13, for a refund."
4,works well,I bought this as a gift for my daughter because it had good reviews. There isn't much of a selection in this size so one buys what one finds will most likely do the job. My daughter does use it and says it works well for her every day needs.
4,Avoids drippy messes,"This item is hard to find but I think it's invaluable. I have only one sink and this sits inside it always. Where else would one put a head of lettuce to drain or washed fruit drip dry? Of course dishes also fit in it, but I don't use it for that. There is always something draining in my sink."
3,just wondering!,"After reading all the ""perfact size"" comments, I ordered one. Find that it does not fit my 60/40 sink (Ancona from costco) because it has curved edges. Believe it will fit perfactly if the sink has right angle corners. Mine sits flush to the countertop. Thus, cannot utilize the space efficiently. Also, they have designed the entire length for holding plates efficiently. They could have kept half for plates and rest for cups etc. Now looking for a flat grid so that I can make the most out of my smaller sink (16 in. x 10.5 in. x 7.5 in). Just wondering where to find one that will fit my sink![...]"
4,Decent,"This book works well on more than one level, juxtaposing truth and justice and offering insights into both within the framework of mystery fiction. We meet a thoroughly honourable policeman, faced with an ethical dilemma. We meet a family, full of well-meaning complexities and a son-in-law who is beyond their pale.This is an English mystery and a fairly quick read. The writer doesn't bog down on his theme, his characters are portrayed carefully and there is a happy ending, if you care for such things.This isn't great fiction but it's a competent piece of work, with more depth than usual, and it's a good read."
4,Power Pop Lives On,"Anything on this record would sound great on AM radio in 1975 along with Big Star (like they would've gotten on radio). It's a cruel world that Bill Lloyd isn't more well known.These songs are definately driven by Lloyd's Rickenbacker and intelligent songwriting. ""Cool and Gone"" is a power pop masterpeice in it simple theme and melodic impact and ""She Won't Be Back"" is one of the best ""ahh, nuts, I finally get it"" songs about a failed relationship to come out in a long time. Very direct and intelligent, but still meaningful to those who've found themselves in a bad (self imposed) position.Along with the incredible (a real national treasure) Marshall Crenshaw, Bill Lloyd is one of the best songwriters still going. I can't wait for the next record."
4,ben 10,"This is a cartoon the whole family will enjoy. My husband, son, and I have watched this dvd and are is some suspence to what is coming next."
3,Slippery,This knife was too heavy and the handle was too slippery when wet.I gave this knife away and bought a 4 inch Mercer utility which has afull feel slip proof handle.
4,"It's Beastie Boys, what more can I say?!? =)","LOOOOVE this, but one prob...where's Paul Revere?!?!? I mean, all the other greats are on this, but in MY opinion, Paul Revere is the BEST! THAT'S why only 4 stars...sorry Boys, I still love you!"
3,"Okay, But That Sound Problem ...","Again, I suggest that Amazon begin offering these files in enhanced formats, such as WAVE or FLAC. The Beasties output was uneven, but essentially a pretty good collection, as it is."
1,beast without beauty,except blunt james compact release withexplicit lyrics means we are unable to sing so we tryto make money with offence&vulgarity
4,The OG rappers!,"Great cd compilation of the original Brooklyn white-boy rappers. This cd has all of their hits, establishing them as one of the original Def Jam, old-school rappers. I love how they included other non-typical hip-hop instruments into their tracks such as rock guitar riffs.A must in any one's hip-hop/rap collection.Definitely your money's worth.JA"
1,i don't own this...,"..and what's the point? All of these songs (minus a few) are on the anthology, along with countless others. The Beastie Boys didn't put this out, their record label did. It's just way for corporate to make money. If you consider yourself a real Beastie Boys fan, that is you're interested in all the other music they made that wasn't put on radio, then don't buy this. If you occasionally heard them on the radio and Fight For Your Right is your favorite song, then go ahead. The Beastie Boys are much more than just their greatest hits. To fully appreciate them, you have to listen to an album all the way through."
5,Beastie Boys,I've always been a fan of the Beastie Boys and I finally got around to purchasing Solid Gold Hits. It is a great CD for any Beastie Boys fan.
4,Great CD!,This CD has awesome hits from The Beastie Boys I would totally recommend this item to anyone who is a big fan of there music! :)
2,I want my cd,"This cd wasn't in with my other ones I ordered.I really enjoy the other cd's I got,and I imagine I would enjoy the Beastie Boys as well,if.....I only had it!"
2,Missing monster hits!!!,"Without ""Paul Revere"", ""Posse In Effect"", ""Rhymin & Stealin'"", ""Hold It Now, Hit It"" and ""Slow And Low"" I am not interested."
4,Good intro compilation,"This ""best of"" album spans from 1986 to 2004, and includes most of the singles and well-known hits from their studio albums. No live recordings or B-sides, but it was a good intro for me, since I didn't own any of their albums before this one. I agree that the sound quality isn't as good on their older songs here. I recommend it for a party or car CD, it doesn't have any ""filler"" songs that mess up the pace."
5,cooooool watch,"I wud rate this watch a full 5... coz as soon as i opened the box, i was flooored.. Its a beautiful piece of art.. esp the small dials wid date, weekday and 24-hr clock..overall a gud experience to do shopping on Amazon..and a USD 20 discount, free shipping..gud deal.."
3,UNIQUE.,"David Nicolle's books for the Osprey series are rather good considering that the series itself is more about regalia than in depth historical analysis. This book is unique in that the author delves into the steady progression from militiamen to professionalism. He gives fine descriptions of the evolution of the deadly crossbow, as well as some highlights of the socio-political scene of this often ignored period. The color plates are very good. If the author had been given more pages I am fairly certain this would have gotten 5 stars. It was worth the price."
4,A Commentary for Preaching and Teaching!,"Start with the text, then move to a standard, scholarly commentary like that of Koester (Anchor) or Lane (Word) but DO NOT start to write your sermon or Bible Class lesson until you have read Long's treatment of the text! He takes the heart of the message and puts it into words that will preach! His structural outline of 7:1 - 10:39 (page 82) ALONE is worth the price of the commentary. I can't imagine how many hours of preparation time Dr. Long saved me by helping me see this structural framework for the Preacher's Christology."
2,Marginally helpful for the neophyte,"Yet another mediocre book on the art of tattooing. If you're looking for in-depth coverage of tattooing, its origins, processes, etc...you're out of luck. If you're looking for good pictures of interesting artwork...you're out of luck.However, if you're the typical college kid interested in skimming the surface of this art and searching for inspiration other than the ubiquitous butterfly on your lower back or ""tribal"" design (being that most tribal designs are not, in fact, truly tribal) around your bicep, this book may indeed help you out a little.I posit a great tattoo book has not yet been written, but at least this author gives modest blurbs (we'll not discuss the butchering of the English language) regarding some of the images rather than throwing yet another book chock-full of uninspired flash with nary a word to read."
4,interesting,"This book gives interesting history on just about any popular tattoo you see around these days. It is very interesting to know that certain popular tattoo art dates back to when it does, and holds a special meaning in certain cultures. You might want to pick up this book if you are interested in finding out some important details about a tattoo you get before you get it, but it may require extra research as the descriptions in the book are very brief."
2,Cover art,"The images on the cover of the book are more interesting that those inside. While the dictionary definitions of many symbols are interesting, there are few images to go along with them, and those that are included are mostly crudely hand drawn. Personally, I was looking for precise images to work off and found little help here. If you are looking for verbage to accompany a design, this is pretty good. If you are looking for a design with verbage, save your money for another."
1,Just completely useless,"I bought this book hoping it would tell me about what certain tattoos say about the people who get them. All this book does is give short, undramtic and plain historical references to cetain symbols, and of no value to me or anyone else. Don't buy this book; it won't capture your interest for 10 minutes."
4,Worth re-buying,"I loaned this book to a friend, and she kept it when she moved. It is worth re-purchasing because it gives some meaning to some of the designs out there. While not all of the descriptions are useful, and the drawings included are not at all what I would want permanently on me, I have used the explanations as a springboard for some of my more meaningful pieces. It's worth checking out if you want to know about more obscure designs."
4,Tattoo guide,Really nice book if you are looking for some meanings to certain tattoos. Doesn't have them all but it's a good start.
5,Simple low cost wire antennas for radio amateurs,"That book is full load with prctical information for any ham beginner who wants to learn by doing wire antennas. It is really helpfull, and well oriented"
5,It is just as the title reads.,The book has good diagrams and is put in simple terms on how to construct many antennas. I do not have a bunch of CC&Rs but I can put many of these antennas where my neighbors do not see them. Unless there is dew on the wires most people to not see the ones I put up.
3,an okay mixed-race book,"The author is a woman of English and African descent (kinda like Sade). She spent years in America as well. This book was different in that it seemed to rely heavily on anthropology rather than ethnic studies or literary studies like most books on multiracials. There are better mixed-race books out there and her experience may be more reflective of Europe than the US. Still, it was a decent book."
2,not enough power,"I know the price is reasonable but the sound quality is not good, you can actually hear a distortion at the middle off the volume power."
4,Mixed but contains some real gems,"Cheri Knight makes this band what it is, and makes this particular album a standout. Two songs she sings - ""The Crying Tree"" and ""Shine"" - are so beautiful and so poignant they will give you goosebumps. Her voice is a soulful mixture of subtle country and emotional inflections. I would recommend buying this album for ""Shine"" alone.The rest of it is OK, good tuneful country rock with an interesting mix of styles and instruments. I only give it 4 stars, but if Knight sang and wrote every song, I'd give it 6."
3,not the underheard classic i was led to believe it was,"i bought this after hearing a slow and lovely song of theirs on the jay farrar-produced and assembled soundtrack to the indie film _the slaughter rule_. that song resembles nothing on this, their alleged masterpiece. what's here is too jumpy, too bluegrassy, too guitary. but it isn't a bad album, just not what i was looking for. there are three splendid tracks, ""titanic,"" ""hell's half-acre,"" and ""bridges."" the ringleader here is the guitarist, a fellow named mark spencer, who is a true guitar god and has lately been collaborating and touring with jay farrar himself."
5,Best of the series,"Blackburne's book is the best of the series, yet they all tend to be of a high calibre. It is highly readable yet carefully researched. As with all the books in the series, it is quite short and can be read in a sitting or two. The book has a wonderful dustjacket and nice tight binding, although for such a slender little book it does fetch a bit of a high price--worth it though!"
5,I love reading others reviews about such a genuine man!!!,"Everything I can say about Mike has been said by everyone else!!!!!Did anyone forget the advective: comforting, or Genuine!!??!! Probably not, but its other words to describe the Mikester!!!Relaxation Tapes????!!!!!Mike could use his comforting voice to do tranquility tapes--and we can all use tranquility after a work day--Has that unusual quality in his voice- he makes you believeeverything he sings---others sing and sound so ""shallow""Is it the fact some people know how to project emotion betterthan others???!!!"
5,From Frank Spencer to amazing singer...WOW,"Michael Crawford is truly amazing. I grew up in England and used to watch him every week on the telly where he starred as the bumbling Frank in the comedy series ""Some mothers do 'ave 'em"". He was thin, scrawny, bumbling, and a real eejit. But oh so funny. (The character, of course.) Then I moved to Canada and heard nothing more about him for years, but then I went back for a visit in the 80's, the time 'Phantom of the Opera' was becoming a big hit and I heard ""The music of the night"" on the radio, and my mum said it was Michael Crawford singing. Well, I just laughed and said 'Yeah, sure'. But, sure enough it was, and I have never been so flabbergasted in my life. What a complete change of direction. Who could ever have believed that such a voice could ever have been hiding inside Frank Spencer! Maybe there is still hope for Mr Bean."
5,The Phantom sing for You,"This is the Michael Crawford album to have. He is just exceptional on this cd. He weaves his Phantom's spell upon the audience from the very beginning. His version of ""Gethsemane"" is the best ever. I get tears every time I hear it. If you enjoy the Phantom at work, buy this album."
2,2 1/2 Stars,"it works but it's fuzzy, i've tried adjusting the gain and used the trouble shooting guide but no luck, it is doing what it's supposed to, i guess my expectations were a little too high."
1,Fake History Cooked to Order,"teachers and librarians deserve to be forewarned that this book provides hard evidence that complaints about ""political correctness"" are not mere right-wing fantasy. Teresi's understanding of mathematics and science is, despite apparent credentials, fatally shallow and distorted. His willingness to concoct historically insupportable myths that are pleasing to his political sensibilities is obvious on every page. His eagerness to insinuate himself into the good graces of the supposed educators who incessantly preach the virtues of ""multiculturalism"" and the vices of ""eurocentrism"" is palpable and pervasive. The book is, in short, a stew of junk science and fake history. But in these peculiar times, it will probably sell very briskly to certain people who mean well but think badly."
5,An amazing book that is sure to be a classic,"...I ran out and bought this book and couldn't stop reading it. It is amazing, revelatory, important, gracefully written and often extremely witty. After reading this book you'll be able to impress your friends by doing ancient Egyptian math--even if you're not particularly mathematical. Lost Discoveries is one of those rare books: a ""big"" book that deserves to be a classic and a part of everyone's liberal education. Teresi is a generous and even-handed writer, never ponderous or dogmatic, and he makes a convincing argument that up until now we've been missing half our intellectual heritage--and a rich one at that. The ancient Greeks did not have a monopoly on intelligent thought; and it is inspiring and deeply moving to learn how much we owe to Sumerian, ancient Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, and mesoAmerican geniuses. Everyone intelligent person should read this book!"
2,I really gave it a shot,"I really did try to read this entire book. The subject is certainly interesting. But I just couldn't do it. With no expertise in the history of science, I was probably a bit too gullible. That got me through the first 150 pages. But then I got tired of forcing myself to read it, read a few good books, came back, and realized that I really didn't like the author's voice - his opining regarding current views, culture, science, etc. Then I read the reviews here, and that did it. It's hard to know whether Teresi or the folks who have written critical reviews are right, but either way, if you can't trust the accuracy of what Teresi has written (and can't stand the perspective from which he writes), why would you read this book?I wouldn't waste my time."
1,More Revisionism,Just what the world needs - more doggerel about how scientific achievement by white people is actually theft from other civilizations.
1,Mush,I could not pick up one spear without it falling apart. Way too soft and mushy for my taste. Might be good for making soup but not as a vegetable side dish.
4,Works,"Nice little item to have in my bag. My lenses are 52mm for my Nikon D40, but got some filters from my Minolta 35mm film and they're 55mm. The ring goes on and off pretty smoothly. Been using it for a couple months now and no issues."
4,reveal the possibility in our daily life,"We are facing a high-tech epoca, our communication could be tapped in any form, so must take more procaution when using modern equipment."
2,Exercise for beginners at a later age,"If you are in your fifties and are just starting to exercise, this would be a nice video to start with, but if you exercise a moderate amount it is not challenging. I'm not one who likes to continue to add on to a routine, for instance adding a knee up after the arm swings, leg kicks, etc, and that's what this video does. This would be good for individuals in their 60's or70's."
3,American drug war,"This documentary is one I would highly reccomend for mature audiences. It exposes the truth concerning the war on drugs, and the insidious nature of the CIA, and even government officials. However a weakness of this documentary is it makes a strong argument that marijuana is not bad when in reality, there are more negatives to marijuana than positives."
2,An unbiased onlooker.,"For those of you looking for a documentary in the most common senese of the word, I suggest you look elsewhere This documentary is slanted as pro-Drugs. Watching the first 20 minutes alone should tell you that many times. Please consider for the sake of your time that if we spend money trying to stop people from hurting themselves with drugs its quite possible we don't want to control them, but simply we don't want them to be controlled."
1,Loser justifies drug use,"Ok, maybe this is too blunt, and maybe you'll learn some interesting ""facts"", but it's hard to stomach the incessant whining from a pothead who just can't believe his marijuana is illegal. His argument of choice is to rely on that familiar moral relativist crutch by pointing to the ills of legal drugs like alcohol and prescription drugs. Boring. And undermines his credibility when trying to figure out which of the other arguments are factual or not."
2,Terrible Journalism,"I had hoped to find interesting dialog about drugs in America, but what I found was a poorly supported report on how drugs are illegal due to a conspiracy. There are many questionable things about drug policy in America, including why some are legal and some are not. This movie doesn't support any claims it makes and only tries to capitalize on peoples desire to legalize drugs.There are many good reasons to decriminalize or legalize certain (perhaps all?) drugs, but this film fails to bring any credible or supported information forward to help people understand better what is going on."
1,Enough,"More racist propaganda of how the government is keeping the minority communities well medicated and incarcerated due to illegal substances. I would agree that the criminalization of drug use should be reviewed on a case per case basis. However, the allegations of race completely take the credibility out of the film very early on."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,Loved Kevin Booth and the film! I did'nt realize it was his film until I started to recognize his voice! Way to articulate your talents and continue on the tradition of spreading the truth!
5,An incredible eye opener on the War On Drugs,"This documentary gives a very concise oversight of the uselessness and even great damaging results of the War On Drugs. The damage is not only in countries in e.g. Latin America but also in the US it has immense negative impact on the whole society. The secret and undemocratic role of the CIA, FBI, DEA, Pentagon and the pharmaceutical industry is shown shortly but very clear. Besides that, the beneficial medical use of Cannabis is explained. It is a medicinal plant that has been used by mandkind for at least some 10.000 years (archeological findings). SEE IT, it will change your view on one of the worlds great problems, although drug abuse is bad for your own health, moderate controlled use has existed since mankind exists, and the real problem is this War On Drugs."
3,"American Drug War: The Last White Hope by Tommy Chong, Freeway Ricky Ross","American Drug War: The Last White Hope by Tommy Chong, Freeway Ricky Ross This is the History of the wasted effort to keep americans from life liberty and the persuit of happiness. Historically accurate and telling in that with all we have to throw at the use of Drugs, it is not enough and a waste of money. Educate and educate them more. I one is an addictive personality, he will become addicted and do damage. He is not criminal in this regard. The drug war is about Money and power. Prohibition is not working now, never has and this is some of the proof of it."
5,Beautiful and Moving Piece in a Language I Can Understand,I wish I knew German but I don't. So when I found this English version of Bach's Matthew's Passion I grabbed it up and never regretted it. I highly recommend this. I'm sure something was lost in the translation but still a wonderful and moving piece.
4,One my favs for Years,This albums always delivers when I pop in it - wherever. You have to be in a special place though to really appreciate it and just liking fusion is a beginning of truly enjoying this album. I've listened to it more than six ways to Sunday and I still find unique patterns and styles lingered through it. Krush just happened to be a DJ that I liked back in the late 90's and when he and Kondo did this album - it was like sex ... for the kids; think TheWeeknd but with Jazz and Trip-Hop.
4,take it for a walk,"I discovered this and found I couldn't take it out of the player. Call it mood music, Absolutely superb. Jazzy.....trancy....almost dancy. I could almost lick it."
3,Sketches of Spain for the Nineties,"If you like a Miles Davis-esque trumpet (late 50's) layered with trip/hip-hop beats, then you will love this record. All the tracks are consistent, but I wish the beats were a bit more creative, with some more variation. (Well, I suppose some people dig the repetition because it's more danceable, perhaps?) The Bu-seki is the best on the album in this regard. Listen more for Toshinori's trumpet (which is nothing extraordinary, by the way) than for the beat, scratches. The interpretation of Bob Marley's piece caught me off guard. It's a foggy harbor, a Whistler painting, a Los Angelican dusk on Codeine, a hazy-rainy dawn - it's all sfumato all the time. Listen with blue lights on. If you've 2 stereos, try it with some solo jazz piano in the background. You may also enjoy Courtney Pine's Underground for a ""jazzier"" experiment with hip-hop beats."
3,Jazziz Magazine is right on the money (scroll up),"The trumpet throughout most of this album is unhelpful enough to make me wish it wasn't there at all on some songs. There are brief moments when Kondo's playing illuminates and enhances Krush's moody, earthy beats, but throughout much of the album the horn playing is uninspired and unfocused enough to become distracting and actually diminish the effect of the beats. In places, it kind of sounds as if Kenny G. wandered into a Tokyo ghetto and couldn't find his way out. Those familiar with Krush's other collaborations with edgier, more bombastic Jazz horns (e.g. Edge of Blue) will recall how well they worked out. The album isn't all bad, though. Krush's signature soundscapes make Ki-Oku a satisfying listen when they're being complimented by Kondo, and still listenable when they're not. Recommended for background music more so than for attentive listening."
5,Wonderful!,This cd is wonderful! The duo takes you through a rabbit hole the never ends. The cd is brilliant at mixing jazz with triphop beats.....i hope they plan on getting together for another one!!!
2,I rated it about 1.5 stars so I rounded up to be nice!,"If you suffer from insomnia, please, please, please, buy this album, especially from me if at all possible."
4,Sketches of Spain for the Nineties,"If you like a Miles Davis-esque trumpet layered with trip/hip-hop beats, then you will love this import. All the tracks are consistent, but I wish the beats were a bit more creative, with some more variation. (Well, I suppose some people dig the repetition because it's more danceable, perhaps?) The second to last track is the best on the album in this regard. Listen more for Toshinori's trumpet than for the beat, scratches. The interpretation of Bob Marley's piece caught me off guard. It's a foggy harbor, a Whistler painting, a Los Angelican dusk on Codeine, a hazy-rainy dawn - it's all sfumato all the time. Listen with blue lights on. If you've 2 stereos, try it with some solo jazz piano in the background. You may also enjoy Courtney Pine's Underground for a ""jazzier"" experiment with hip-hop beats."
3,A nice Iguana mix of melodies,"As an avid Iguanas fan, I was eager to check out this new offering. It's not a classic album but it does offer a refreshing variety of songs. The tracks vary from the delightfully melodic ""Dear Walter"" to the jazzy measures of ""La Llanta..."" and the hilarious ""You Killed My Buzz"". My personal fave is the moody, sultry, enigmatic ""Si Amanece Nos Vamos"". It's good listening."
4,"Mixed bag, but a few MUST HAVE tracks!","Some of the other reviews here are way too harsh on this disc. Yes, it's a bit uneven, but it also has several of the Iguanas best tracks. This disc is worth having just for ""Arrimate"" alone--my favorite Iguana tune! Most of the CD rocks and swings quite nicely, and none of the tunes are really that bad. Check it out!"
3,bouncin' back,"After the low point that was ""Superball"" a lot of the life and spirit are once again beating with ""Sugar Town"". Not quite to the standards of the first two albums, but much more hopeful. If you cannot find the first two releases, this captures 3 times the spirit of ""Superball"". It sounds like the Igauanas. Hope still springs, because when they are on !!!"
3,"""Not all the original artists""","This is an so-so CD, it lifts the spirits with its'originals, then brings it slamming down with its' copy(s).What's a girl to do?[...]"
5,Soul Christmas Reminds Me Of My Dad,I am so happy with this purchase...it has some of the greats that my Dad introduced me to in music! Love It!!
1,DO NOT BUY FROM GRADY'S,"GRADYS STATED THEY DID NOT CARRY THIS ITEM AND THAT THIS WAS LISTED IN ERROR. THEY JUST SENT ME ANY OLD FAUCET. I PAID FOR A DELTA NICKLE FINISH THEY SENT ME A PEERLESS CHROME FAUCET WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING TO SEE IF I WANTED A SUBSTITUTION. I CALLED THEM, THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID SHE WOULD EMAIL ME A LINK FOR A RETURN WITH UPS. THIS PROMISE WAS BROKEN. SO, TODAY I WENT TO POST OFFICE AND MAILED THE PRODUCT THAT I NEVER ORDERED BACK. I AM DISPUTING THE CHARGE WITH MY CREDIT CARD. THE GRADY REPRESENTATIVE WAS CURT, RUDE AND INEFFECTIVE AND DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR MISTAKE. SO FAR, I WILL LOSE RETURN SHIPPING AND INSURANCE COSTS."
4,"It's not only for the boys, it's for everyone","OK, the film from which this came is a bit muddled and wasn't great. (James Caan has a unique place in show biz for having played similar characters opposite two of moviedom's great movie musical divas -- Bette & Barbra -- in classic period pieces!)But, love the movie or not, the soundtrack is terrific. I agree with the other comments that Bette was in great voice for this and the song selection is terrific. Bette is a classic entertainer. She doesn't have the MOST thrilling voice with the greatest range, but, wow, she always knows what to do with it and she's in good company with her contemporaries like Barbra and Liza.She tells a story in her music and she conveys what the song is about in an uncanny manner. I've seen her live a few times (that's a real treat if you haven't done that) and happily, the same essence that comes across in-person and makes her such a stand out in that arena also comes across in her recordings. Enjoy!"
4,ageless music,"It is the music - For the boys - I call ageless, you can always listen again and again. Not agressive but not boring, just right. Good CD, good job!"
3,Better-Than-Average Mystery,"I generally love romances and merely tolerate mysteries, but I enjoyed reading Caught in the Net. Jessica Thomas does a good job keeping the reader's attention. She presents both obvious and hidden clues without revealing ""who dunnit"" too early. The only shortcoming of this book was in the relationship between Alex and Janet. The two women said ""I love you"" after only a few dates without any real build-up."
5,Fun new voice!,"I love lesbian mysteries and read them like popcorn, so it is always welcome to try out a new flavor and see what it's like. I hope Jessica Thomas writes a whole bunch more books about Alex Peres.Alex herself is an interesting woman. She pays the bills with routine business type investigations, and spends the rest of her time with her camera and her dog Fargo, documenting P-Town's beauty. Her gun's been in the safe so long it's probably rusty and she's more concerned with dating than danger.She might be humdrum, even, if Thomas didn't give Alex a wry, amusing, insightful personality and a way with a turn of phrase and a humorous remark that is up there with Scoppetone's Laurano.It's not a long, nor terribly involved book, and I figured things out about the same time Alex did -- but the red herrings did work. All in all, it was an unexpectedly fine bowl of popcorn, perfect for a rainy afternoon at home or a sunny beachside day in, well, Provincetown."
3,Mystery? Romance?,"Well this book was ok, not great but enjoyable. I think it was lacking in its ability to keep me guessing who was the bad guy, or girl in that matter. But it was funny and warm."
2,POOR PLASTIC VINYL QUALITY,I ordered 3 $9.99 each on sale by Amazon.com & i returned all three because the quality is terrible and look cheap!!
3,Critical Shopper,"While the cap was black, the flatten top style and buckle on the back was not want I wanted. They did not show the back nor mention the style of the back of the cap."
4,"Informative, if a little stuffy","The author recommends the reader have several years of college-level music training. He uses harmonic/melodic analysis as one would use in dissecting W.A. Mozart, et al, in theory class. This is an interesting and insightful approach that sometimes gets a bit too clever, given the subject matter. The author demonstrates genuine admiration for the Beatles as composers/poets/performers, but occasionally becomes condescending, perhaps a product of his academic background. On the other hand, he seems to be very precise regarding who played what on which track--that's interesting for a musician at any level. All in all, an engrossing work. The more knowledge of music theory the reader possesses, the more he/she will enjoy this book."
2,For musicians only,I am a moderate guitar player ( with a Hamburg type Rickenbacker guitar) and wanted to learn a little more about the guitar cords used in Beatle songs. I am not afraid to tell that I don't understand anything. If you haven't learned music theory for at least some years at school this book could be a dissapointment for you as it turned out to be for me
3,Very Cute Puzzle But....,"I loved this puzzle for my 4 year old daughter and thought she would like a little more of a challenge. She was very upset though because the pieces did not fit together nicely. You have to force the pieces together and when completed, you can actually pick the puzzle up without a single piece falling off. (Which did not justify in her mind the lack of ease putting it together). I have to help her and it is very frustrating to her since she loves to sit and do puzzles by herself sometimes. Also, the pieces come in a plastic bag inside of the box which may have contributed to some of the pieces being bent and distorted. The picture quality though is very beautiful."
3,Adequate but box lacks a large picture of the full image,"This is a perfectly adequate 100-piece puzzle for my daughter, who was 5 when she received it. In our copy of the puzzle, at least, the pieces all fit together well--smoothly but not too tightly. But the pieces are not very durable. On both this puzzle and another 100-piece M&D puzzle we own, the top layer with the picture has peeled off the underlying cardboard on a couple of the pieces. Easy to glue back, but still. My one real gripe about this and other similar M&D puzzles is that the image on the top of the box is only a partial image of the completed puzzle. If your child needs to consult the box picture for help, s/he has to rely on one of the very small pictures on the sides of the box, not the main one on the top."
5,Great Puzzle,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it due to all the colors. The pieces are not flimsy like other puzzles. The different colors gave her a challenge which is good. I would recommend for a 6 year old.
4,Decent shower head,"After looking around on Amazon for a dual shower system like this, I settled on this one. The construction is plastic but feels very solid and looks good. This is a very good solution for a add on type thing. It connects and installs in minutes and have had no leaks.I've been using it for about four months. The only thing I think that could be better is the shower heads. They have different sprays but don't have much pressure when both are on. (and I live in a new condo building in LA with amazing pressure)Also I can't use the suction cup on the bottom because I have a rougher tile, so maybe a different type of end that you could attach with some sticky something might be good. Doesn't bother me too much those as the top support is good enough.Would buy again. Sure beats having to buy a system from the home store ($150) then hard install the bar and all."
1,Cheap flimsy,"Ordered this product for our new bath. It arrived in a timely manner but when we took it out of the boxthe hose was kinked and made of cheap rubber with an obvious fake ""stainless"" wrapping. We gthoughthe kinks would work out when we used hot water.... One week later, no such luck.The head are constantly slipping and falling out of position sending water out of the shower and on to the floor. I do not recommend this product."
3,"Looks ok, but no go","Plastic parts broke during installation so we'll be taking this product back. Looks nice and looks like it has nice features but we'll never know,too many plastic parts."
1,worst ever ... worse than what i replaced it with,"This fixture is 98% plastic. Wish I could say it looks like metal, but it doesn't. Got this on clearance and I'm sorry to say I still feel ripped off. I ordered 2 and already threw away one to replace it with a Price Pfister slide bar. Any of these that are left need to be dropped off at the dump."
2,Decent if you don't mind low water volume/pressure.,"I don't like this shower head much, will probably replace it soon despite paying $50 for it.Cons1. First of all the hose is cheap looking rubber and not metal like is shown on the box or even in the amazon picture. (Deceptive advertising.)2. The shower head doesn't swivel very well and is limited in range so I can't push it as high up or down as I like.3. Lastly this is a low flow shower head. I don't mind so much, but my wife that has thick long hair hates it because its too hard to get shampoo out.Pros1. Doesn't use a lot of water.2. It looks nice and the it switches between settings easy enough."
1,Not made to fit my existing STANDARD plumbing.,"Poor fit. Can't use. Water shoots out after PROPER installation. YES, it was PROPER installation. Can't return to Amazon because it was purchased as a gift for Christmas and finding time to install it didn't happen until after the 30 days had expired. Stuck with a showerhead we can't use. Noticed AFTER installation that it is Conair. Opposed to Conair. Would not have purchased if this had been noticed out of the gate. Live and learn."
4,Works well but has one significant flaw,"The good: Near perfect weight. Handle is easy to grip, even for large hands. Does exactly what it is supposed to do at an excellent price. I have pounded many dozens of chicken breasts and steaks with this. Very comfortable and effective.The bad: The weight has two parts, an inner weight surrounded by the outer stainless steel casing. The two do not come apart. When washed upright, then turned over to dry, rusty water drips from the seam between the weight and casing. Obviously, the inner weight is not stainless steel. And also obviously, meat juice can enter this space. Because of this I wash it in the dishwasher then boil it to be sure it is thoroughly clean.Notes: I have used this pounder for about six months. I would buy it again and recommend it. However, I would also strongly recommend the wash and boil routine after every use to be sure it is clean and sanitized."
5,This is Music,"When I heard this album, the first thought that came to mind was music. The CD has tracks."
1,Awful,Price too high and the suction cups do not work at all it was a huge disappointment and the cost outrageous
3,Toilet Monster,"I looked at reviews before purchasing, and was aware that the suction cups were marginal. As it turns out, the way the manufacturer packaged this about 1/2 of the suction cups were marginal, the other 1/2 were damaged in packing and were totally useless. I did some modification to make it work - lots of trouble for the price. I wanted the novelty item, I didn't contact the seller because I was sure that another one would be equally broken. Don't buy it unless you are ready to do some work to make it something other than totally useless."
3,Flimsy,The suction cups are to small and it falls into the toilet before the user get to open the lid. Nothing funny about a prank gone wrong :(
1,garbage,this is garbage. Save your money. Light a cigar with cash. That would be a more useful way of spending your cash. Suction cups DONT work. It falls in the toilet every time..
3,It's okay,"Good prank for getting my boys, but it's kind of hard to get the suction cups to attach to the toilet lid."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON TO USE ON OUR FAMILY WHEN WE WENT ON VACATION. BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURE YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS GONNA BE HYSTERICAL. THE ONLY HYSTERICAL PART IS THAT I ACTUALLY WASTED MONEY ON THIS ITEM. IT DOES NOT FIT ANY TOILET. I TRIED USING AT HOME, IN THE VACATION CONDO, AT MY MOTHER'S. IT JUST DOES NOT WORK THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO. HE DOES NOT ""POP"" OUT. AND OF COURSE YOU CANNOT RETURN IT SINCE IT WAS IN YOUR TOILET. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY."
3,its ok,"i like it though i didnt get to scare anyone with it yet... you see- everyone in my home knows i have it, and come to the toilet, knowing that it might wait for them their...but i guesse that it would scare an unexpecting guy who really needs to use the toilet..."
4,Boo!,"Before April Fool's Day this year, I ordered two of these guys - one to get my dad, one to get my husband. Both were a smashing success! My mother had to be my co-conspirator on the one for my dad, and she had some trouble with the suction cups and had to add a little tape to the mix, but it scared him fabulously all the same. (My dad gets us every year, and revenge - lovingly imposed - is sweet!)On my end, the suction cups worked pretty well - although the little monster comes folded up and I think flat shipment would make it stick even better since the plastic crease wouldn't work against you - and the final effect was amazing! 5:30 in the morning I hear a ""DAHAHAHAH!"" from my husband about falling over from the shock of a green monster jumping out at him from the toilet. It was awesome! Best investment in ages!"
2,Green Toilet Monster of Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this product. The suction cups on this were very poorly made. It did not stick to the toilet and it didn't ""pop"" out of the toilet as shown in the picture. It was more of a slow ""peek"" out of the toilet."
2,Great prank. if it worked,"This is a very good, well made product, but i couldn't get it to stick to the toilet seat to save my life! I finally ended up taping it with duct tape."
1,Disappointment,"I should have listened to other reviewers. It looked so funny when we saw it on America's Funniest Videos that we couldn't resist trying it for ourselves. We were prepared with duct tape to re-enforce the suction cups, but it wasn't enough.It was a disappointment and earned the remark, ""Was this supposed to be funny?"":C"
1,Powder Puffs,"I was disappointed with the size of these puffs. I wanted a largerpowder puff than the one I purchased. The size was described as ""Medium""bu I thought it should have been classified as ""Compact Small""."
2,disapointed,I thought I was buying body sized powder puffs - 3 to 4 inches wide. What I got were small make up pads. At almost $3.00 each plus shipping they were definitely over priced.Ad needs to be more explicit
4,Head's response,"Must viewing for all African-American males, particularly those who are dating or who have been married for less than 5 years. Well acted, thought provoking insight into Black women. I highly recco. it."
4,toxic is not a black woman thing,It's not about assertive modern American womanhood either. This was entertainingly different but it didn't create in me a prejudice against black women even though the female characters were shrews. Maybe this movie depicts wishful thinking on the part of non Black people that there is truth in marrying out equals marrying up for successful Black people like Wesley Snipes turning down Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale.
2,Not what I expected,"Really this is more like a documentary. It veiws black women in a negative way,maybe some is true, but it is mainly a sterotype. I don't care much for it. It is too drawn out, no real facts. I fell asleep."
2,Good idea but...,"The idea behind this documentary is good. I stopped watching it when the filmmaker, I think, starting getting too much involved in the comments of the people he was interviewing. Isn't he supposed to be impartial or else was he trying to prove he is right saying ""Black women are angry""?In addition, I do not think the root of this ""anger"" only lies on the way Black women were treated or what their experiences were. I wished he dig deeper."
3,Story lines kind of lost me.,Movie was ok not one of the best but definitely not the worst I have seen. One of those movies you might have to watch twice to understand.
5,Really Great Film!,"I first saw ""Diary of a Tired Black Man"" on Showtime and I must say that I REALLY enjoyed this film. It definitely brings up topics that we as African Americans often talk about in regards to our relationships with one another. This movie is sure to spark up conversations between you and your mate, friends, etc. I think this film was very well done! :)"
1,Diary of a Tired Black Man,"Horrible! Firstly, what was this?! It could not rightly be classified as a documentary or a movie. The piece begins with a clip about a woman upset with her ex-husband for being in an interracial relationship. Then it flips to random people on the street to get their opinion of the clip. And that is how the entire piece went; a constant series of fights between the couple, followed by on-the-street commentary. My second problem with the piece was the one-dimensionality of the female character. She was always angry and upset. No one is ever that one dimensional. There are many facets to human character, ups, downs, highs, lows. Even an angry person has various facets to their personality."
3,Commentary????,"The movie was okay, but it was more like a commentary because everytime it started to get good, he started asking individuals or groups of people about black relationships. I thought there was an actual plot but it was more like watching a ghetto version of 20/20 news with Barbara Walters! It was overall disappointing! If you want an actual movie to watch, don't buy this. If you like commentaries or interviews, go for it. This is definitely for you."
1,"Terrible Acting, Terrible Movie",The acting was awful but thankfully there wasn't much. It is mostly men whining about their trouble with women. It could be much shorter than it is and it's a bit boring.
4,not what you think,"I went into seeing this movie thinking that it was going to be a cheesy low budget movie but, I was wrong! This movie actually was really good. I recommend this movie to anyone that has a good man or a regular man, and sometimes wonder if he is worth the trouble! Even if you don't have a man and want to know what a good man should be doing. Watch it!"
3,"Boring, but informative to the shallow and ignorant","I was displeased that it wasnt a movie but gave it a try. It had some good points but was not agreeing with the display of black women complaining and blaming everyone but themselves. I understand the fact that a lot of women hold on these grudges and build those high-walled guards to men because of the voids in their hearts when it comes to men; some didnt have a supportive father to be the man in her life to mold her into some understanding about men. And some just have thier personal issues, opinions that may not make any sense to have a reason wear the ""Men aint #@$""! sign. I understand the men on this one but I didnt like how this documentary embrace the fact that MAYBE its the women. this was a finger-pointing documentary and what no one talked about was how people need to check themselves when it comes to having what you need rather than what you want. That goes for the men AND the women."
4,informative and needed information,"I just recently got out of a relationship that was similar to alot of the events that i saw in this movie. I was just about to let my girlfriend at the time watch this movie,but it was obviously too late.She could've been a good girlfriend,but she had sooo many insecurities from past relationships and regarding black men as a whole.She was always suspicous of me cheating,when i wouldn't do such a thing.She reminded me so much of the girl in the movie,so inappreciative and fiesty like.I recommend couples and singles purchase this,because there could be more enriching relationships after this enlightning experience."
2,Thank Goodness it was so cheap!,"I have arrived at a point in my life, when I will question who is speaking and what they are saying, and what gives them the right to say it, before I spend my money on anything. Of course this revelation came after I purchased this DVD.I don't think this DVD's subject matter is the material of social revolution it was proclaimed to be or would cause. The premise is faulty and the 'experts' interviewed on the subject were biased. Angry Black Woman Syndrome indeed! It seemed like a retalitory vendetta by an Angry Black Man."
4,more or less amazing,"this is, quite possibly, one keiji haino's greatest recent recordings (though he has set so much transcendental beauty to disc lately it is hard to single out a favorite). haino and legend rashied ali compelement each other particularly well on this one; their stylistic differences strengthen each others' personal musical statements. bill laswell is...well he's bill laswell. a lot of effects. sort of a bubbly bass sound. when he comes to the fore, the music falters, but this cd is worth the purchase price for the first track alone. a punishing yet easygoing listening experience. really."
1,this album really licks,"Unfortunately, I bought this album upon the recommendation of a once trusted music buddy. Never again will I take her once heeded wisdom. This album really is quite bad. These people should never have attempted such a preposterous idea. ETBTG unplugged? Hah Hah...nice try."
2,Gwen from New Orleans,"We were very disappointed with this product. Perhaps it would work better if you screwed it into the wall, but we wanted one that worked by tension. It took longer than expected to install, and once it was up, it was extremely hard to open with two hands, much less one. We have packed it up and are shipping it back tomorrow!"
1,Has to be the worst out there !,"I bought this gate because it was the only one I could find that fit at the bottom of the stairs at my house....big mistake. It was not too difficult to set up, although they could have made the process simpler, but OMG... it was impossible to open once installed.They advertise that you can open it with one hand, but people who can do that must be magicians. I could not open this gate even using both hands.Needless to say, it is going back to BabiesRUs and now I have to search for another gate that will fit my 39 inch opening at the bottom of the stairs."
3,Case closed,"Getting the gate up was a challenge, but the worst part was yet to come. I have no problems with getting my gate opened, it's getting it closed that is another story. Everytime I try to close the gate, it seems to slide off out of the position in my doorway unless I use two hands, one to hold the frame still and the other to work the door. My baby hasn't even come along yet and I can only imagine the problems that will cause."
1,Not Happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After searching for ""easy to open"" gates my wife picked this one. What a mistake. It is NOT easy to open and the top of it slides forward when open. It would be less frustrating to build a small wall that adults can step over than put this thing up! At least 1 hr to get it ""jerry-rigged"" to work. Oh, by the way, if you have base and shoe moulding on your walls, forget it!! You must lift the tensioned areas at least over the shoe moulding, but then why have the gate if your doing that!!"
1,Impossible to open,"I bought this gate becuse I like the way it looked an I thought it would be easy to operate. Not at all. I could only open when using both hands, and even then I had to really work at it. I took it back and bought the Hands Free Gate from The 1st Years. It truly is hands free and works great. Better yet, it is $10.00 dollars cheaper."
1,Don't buy this gate!,"Like one other reviewer, I too thought the gate was welded crooked. Then I had to adjust the size of the gate to fit into the doorway. Impossible. I could not open the gate easily with one hand as the product claims and I couldn't see my wife doing it while holding our child. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this product and this company wasted my time so I couldn't help myself."
2,Had to return it!,"This gate sure looks nice, but after 1 1/2 hrs of tring to install and widen the gate - we have to return it. My husband's thumbs were throbbing for hours later. You have to press in so hard to extend it- it was ridiculous! Well, after it was installed, I had to test the ""easy one hand operation."" I could not press in the button to open the handle for my life. My fingers too were throbbing. I couldn't keep it if I couldn't open it with one hand. I even tried two hands - and no go."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"I thought that this gate looked so secure and safe, especially since it had mesh instead of hard metal bars to prevent climbing and injury. Was I wrong! My husband, who is very mechanically-inclined put the gate together. Once it was up, I pulled on the mesh; the tension doesn't stay tight, it sags considerably. But the worst part is even with maximum tension applied, if you put a little bit of pressure on the gate, the whole thing slides back and forth. There is no way I am going to use this gate, it is completely unsafe and would fall onto my baby if she tried to pull up on it. I guess it would be fine for a baby who doesn't touch anything, ever."
1,Horrible and Expensive,We bought the gate because we have a larger than normal doorway to the kitchen. The gateway does not attach securely and would not be a real barrier to our 10 month old. It was harder to install than other gates and hard to open when installed. Wish we had read the reviews before purchasing. Back to Babies R Us to return today.
1,HATED IT!!!,I was not able to install this gate myself. My husband who can install anything had a difficult time. It is not easy to open especailly if you have your little one in hand. We were unable to get it to work properly and ended up stepping over it. I was totally frustrated and returned it.
5,"Works Great, Looks Great!!!","I believe I got one of the first ones. I was attracted to it because it mostly uses a soft mesh to be the barrier not metal or wood which would just be another hard surface in my house. It was easy to set up, expanded into the doorway I needed it to and plus it's a walk-through gate which makes getting through a breeze. The handle to open and close it really works well, especially when I have my hands full : )Anyway for all the features and the price I thought this was the best gate out there, and with 2 kids, one on the way, and a dog I've seen and used plenty."
4,easy to use,"I purchased this gate after reviewing several other gates. I have 4 kids and a dog in a 2 story house. I was using the wooden gates that lock into place and you have to step over to prevent my 1 and 3 year olds from climbing the stairs, but that ment my 10 and 12 year old either had to take the gate down or climb over the banister to get to their rooms. My husband and I both agreed that we did not want to screw anything into the wall but needed a swing through gate at the bottom of the stairs. This gate seemed to fit the need. It was somewhat difficult to extend to fit the opening with the puch buttons but once adjusted is easy enough for my 10 year to open on his own and sturdy enough to keep the 1 year old downstairs. The gate does slide a little if you open it all the way, however it does come with brackets you can mount with screws into the wall to hold it if this a concern."
1,An Absolute Piece of Junk,"This product is, without question, the worst I have purchased thus far. Forget about how it works, mine didn't even come manufactured at a 90 degree angle. I have never felt the need to post a review on this site until I got this piece of garbage into my home. I am convinced that the people that wrote positive reviews about this product have some sort of vested interest in this company. Don't buy this gate."
4,Runaways,"Alex, Gert, Nico, Karolina, Molly, and Chase find out that their parents are villians and that they might be in danger with their loved ones. Now they have to runaway and they are asking themselves how did it happen? They stayed up all night to practice their powers. Now that they Know that molly could be in a lot of danger their mission is to find her. Will they find her? This book is fild whit lots of excitement and mystery so if you like fantasy this is your book."
4,Fun fresh read,"This one took me by surprise. I heard that is was well written, but hadn't heard about any of the plot or characters. Without giving away any spoilers, this books has some good twists, a fresh cast of characters, and no Marvel Universe baggage."
4,"Great book, but spring for the Hardcover collection.","Well drawn, well written, all the prerequisites for a good comic, but be warned, these volumes are digest sized (think the old TV guide or manga books). Not that this is a bad thing, it's compact and easily concealable, but if you want something full sized spring for the Hardcover Collections. I bought this volume and two days later ordered both available hardcovers. Besides last I checked Vol. 2 was sold out on Amazon."
1,i'm ron burgundy?,"if you were on a deserted island with nothing and a copy of any of vaughan's works drifted on the beach, at least you'd be supplied with a little wipey paper and firestarting paper for a time."
4,For true fans,"This book will be appreciated by true T&D addicts,although switching back and forth between their two voices made it seem mildly disjointed.Details of the unglamourous side of life on the road gave a realistic perspective.Not bad,but it somehow left me wanting more.A great deal of trivial details without alot of the substance such a book could have had.Fans will enjoy it,casual readers may not..."
1,"In a word, AWFUL.","Just streamed this movie for free, and although it cost me nothing in a monetary sense, I can never get back the last 90 minutes of my life.Terribly acted all around, weak, done-to-death plot and no scares at all.Just plain bad.I thought this might be a fun way to kill some time.It wasn't.Don't waste yours."
2,Chronicles of An Exorcism,I had received it damaged and had it returned for another DVD. When that arrived the DVD had a few flaws in it and I had it returned again.
1,LaCie drive fried my fire wire port,I plugged the drive into my fire wire and it destroyed my fire wire port. I called LaCie and they will replace the drive but won't fix my computer. They said it was most likely a short in the drive or cable and their warranty doesn't cover my laptop. Way to stand behind your product guys! So in short I spent almost $300 dollars to have my laptop damaged by this drive and who knows how much repairs will be. I will NEVER buy a LaCie product again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"These books are great, but...","I have enjoyed this author from the very first book. The characters are well written and engaging and the stories draw you right in. However, after reading the last two in the series, I can't help but wonder if the author dislikes the main character. I am not sure whether I will read the next book or not."
5,The best cherry Pitter ever.,The best cherry pitter ever.. I froze several pints for later use over ice cream.. Just wish the cherry season was longer..
5,Rose petal,"Where has this been all my life? Now I can freeze those wonderful, juicey cherries. Before it was such a hastle and of course the cherries ended up in two pieces. Now they remain whole. This Cherry Pitter is great."
4,Simple and Effective,"This product is simple and efffective. I would have given it 5, but it can miss a pit every once in a while if you are pitting fast and get careless."
2,Doesn't work well for large olives. The handles are too short so you don't enough leverage. The Pitts didn't fit in the hole.,Didn't try on cherries just large green olives. I suggest if you need it for large olives do not buy this model
3,Ok..but a paper clip works better...,"When I was a kid, we pitted buckets of sour pie cherries every year. We froze them and Mom made pies all winter long. So I consider myself an expert on pitting cherries. I bought the pitter because I had a gift certificate I needed to use and because I like gadgets. This one works ok. It generally gets the pit out. But it is messy and time consuming.I went back to my old tried and true pitting tool...A paper clip. Just insert the clip where the stem was, push it down and under the pit. Then scoop/pull/flick the pit back up through the stem hole. Use a small paper clip for sour pie cherries, and a big paper clip for sweet red cherries or Queen Anne cherries. It is way less messy than the OXO pitter, because the only hole is at the top of the cherry. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you..."
3,OXO cherry pitter ok,"I purchased this particular product because it was endorsed by a cooking magazine. It is fairly easy to use and cleans easily, but I didn't expect it to leave such a large hole in what you were pitting. The other thing I don't care for is the ""splash guard"" frequently comes off during the pitting process. I will continue to use this product because it's better than nothing."
2,You'd better have big cherries,"I used this on fabulous-tasting but small (probably 1/2 inch in diameter) cherries picked from a neighbor's cherry tree with dismal results. But, when I used it on larger cherries purchased from the grocery store, it was fabulous. So, if you're buying big cherries, this thing is great. If you're going to use it on small cherries, save your money. I just wish the description made it clear that this was for bigger cherries because it's a dud for the smaller ones."
5,very useful,Great gadget..comes in very handy for kids especially..my 3 year old would'nt let me cut the cherries into half for me to be able to pit them but with this cherry pitter I can maintain the shape and look of the cherry and pit the seed easily for her!
4,cherry pitter,"ok this is my first cherry pitter. so lets see how it worked.1 it worked fine on hard cherrys not alot of miss strikes.2 when i had softer cherrys seems it missed alot more because the pit was able to move around some.over all i pitted enought cherrys for 2 pies and had to go back to each cherry that was a miss strike and remove the pit was a bit messy cherry juice must be cleaned up quickly or it stains the counter top.after 2 cherry pies i only missed 1 pit and who ever got that peace also got ice cream. so over all im happy doing one cherry at a time,and easy to clean must be cleaned right after usage to make it easy. but i like my gagets that make things easyer and people think you know what your doing."
5,Yahoo! No more stained fingers!,"I love this cherry pitter. With two young children who adore cherries, it was all I could do to keep up with them using a paring knife for pitting. With this purchase, I'm fast enough to eat a cherry or two myself without incurring demands for ""more"", all without acquiring burgundy fingernails. I love it. Most of the time, especially with firm cherries, the pits are entirely removed; occasionally with softer cherries I need to finish the job."
5,Cherry Pitter,Product arrived on time and in good condition. Seems to work very well and is very easy to clean.
2,Para azeitonas no serviu bem,"Comprei este extrator de caroos para usar com azeitonas. Apesar de constar na embalagem que pode ser utilizado em azeitonas, ele no executa bem o servio. Só consegue extrair o caroo das azeitonas pequenas e mesmo assim na maioria das vezes elas ficam todas esmigalhadas. Decidi comprar este item nos EUA porque no achei nada que me ajudasse no Brasil, porém minha frustrao continua. Talvez para cereja ele seja bom. A qualidade do produto é boa também."
3,this one works,this one works b ut you`ll still get juice on your hands with the larger bing cherries.
1,This thing sucks for olives,"I cannot believe people gave it 5 stars.It really is aweful for olives. Since there's no leverage it very hard to press the pit out, and once the pit releases it closes very fast. Pinched my thumb. :(I wish they sold something like this: [...].It's what my parents had when i was a kid and it worked well."
1,Didn't work for me,"This didn't work for me. After pitting less than 20 cherries, about 40% of the cherry pits didn't get pitted. Also, on the last cherry, the pit got stuck in the hole and no matter what I did, the pit would NOT come out. I had to return it and even they could not get it out (I bought it at a local store). They need to improve the design and make a bigger whole.I got this product after returning the ""Cherry Chomper"" which didn't work very well either."
1,Too much effort,I can see this working for someone who is pitting cherries to create a dish with. But if you're simply pitting them to pop them in your mouth and chew you're better off just spitting out the pit. It's just too much work and one and a time pitting just isn't worth it.
2,semi-pitter,"Perhaps, the sour cherries were too small for the pitter, but very few attempts resulted in a clean ""pitting"". The pit was usually still attached to the cherry and had to be removed by hand. After placing cherry in pitter, you press the plunger, remove semi-pitted cherry, remove pit, and place pit and cherry in respective containers. The procedure is a bit more compex (and messy) than I envisioned. Next time, I will use a knife for a few pounds to see if the Oxo is worth the trouble. The item is well made and comfortable to use but just didn't work for me."
3,Grips Cherry Pitter,Works well but the pit can shoot out which its suppose to do but if you use a bowl to catch the pit you can easily miss the bowl or plate or whatever you use. I would puchase a Cherry Pitter that can also catch the pit.
5,terrific specialty gadget!,"Works great and easy to clean and store. I love Oxo products, and this does not disappoint. I wish cherries were avail. All year round!"
5,good tool,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great tool to have if you have kids. I have a toddler who loves fresh fruit and now I can prepare cherries for him quickly and easily, with much less mess. Will be great for making desserts with fresh cherries now, too."
4,Love this product!,"I should say that I love OXO products and I love little kitchen gadgets, even ones that only have one use! I also love fresh cherries in the summer time. I don't mind eating around the pits but my young boys (8 and 6) haven't been able to master that art so they hated eating cherries. This is a great pitter, simple enough for them to use, doesn't make too much of a mess. Yes, your sink will still look like a crime scene -- just put the strainer in the drain and you can rinse it out and get all the pits into the strainer to dump. But your clothes will stay clean and I can do a whole bag of cherries in a relatively short amount of time and the soft handle keeps my hand from ever hurting."
4,Perfect for smaller amounts of cherries,This Cherry pitter works very nice except for the occasional stuck pit that does not get seperated from the cherry. The splash gard works well but you still want to hold it down into the sink. The grip feels very nice in the hand. Easy to wash out. Would definetly buy again.
5,Fantastic Product,I love this product!! My 3 year old daughter loves to eat cherries and it used to take me a long time to pit the cherries before I could give them to her. Now it only takes me a minute to pit an entire bowl for her. It is so easy and with little mess. Now I would even try to make a fresh cherry pie since it would be effortless to pit the cherries. I would definately recommend this product to a friend!
4,Great tool for any kitchen,I love cherries but it's a pain to pit them and it's rude to spit the pits out when you are eating them. This tool solves the problem. The only problem is sometimes it doesn't pit the cherry and if you're not careful you can miss it.
4,Fun to work with,"The farmer's market always seem to have fresh cherries in two pound bags - and I'm not a big fan of spitting out the pits - so this works great, although does take some time since you're only pitting one cherry at a time (I guess there are some high-speed pitters out there!)."
5,Works spectacularly if...,"Seems some folks are having problems with this pitter. I sat down and pitted enough cherries for a pie (half gallon) and encountered one, count 'em one, miss-fire. This came when I loaded the cherry in cross-wise. For the rest of the time, I loaded them so the metal plunger comes down through the hole where the stem came out and I literally came out with a 100% success rate. No exaggeration here, folks. The miss-fire I had, as I mentioned, is when I loaded the cherry in cross-wise and the pit just got pushed off to the side. So, if you load it right, I have found it to be 100% awesome in accomplishing its task.P.S. I also suggest firing the pits directly into your mouth so you can nibble off the chunk of cherry that comes out with each pit. It's efficient, far more clean and overall far more fun. = )P.P.S The pie came out fantastic!"
5,Fabulous product!,Wow--this is such a clever tool! I made a cherry cobbler for the first time using fresh cherries and I pitted a bag in about ten minutes. Super easy--just be sure you're not wearing white because you will get a little splatter! Great tool!
5,A Must Have For All Parents!!!,"I bought this CD at Walmart in 2003 and have worn it out putting my son to sleep for the past 10 years. He is 10 now and still can't stay awake past song 3. We listen to it every night. Every time someone I know has a child, I always include a copy of this CD in the gifts I give them. I'm now ordering two backup CDs (just in case). Mr. Wolpert, you sir have created THE ALBUM of all albums for parents. Thank you!"
1,Codebreaker doesn't work for mine.,I bought Codebreaker hoping it would be a replacement for the Gameshark adapter I have on my old PS1. The Codebreaker never really worked. I couldn't get some of my games to work right. I prefer to have Gameshark instead.The Codebreaker codes still exist on some websites if it does work for you.
3,Least Favorite Book by Deana James,"I think this was her first published novel. What she was apparently trying to do here was show what happens after the Happy Ending, when the hero goes back to his rakish, piratical ways and abandons the heroine on the plantation.Neither the hero nor the heroine are particularly likeable. After a while I began to wish that their pirate ship would sink with them and all hands aboard."
4,Great Book,"This book follows the interweaving lives of two families. A woman who is escaping the French Revolution runs to her wealthy cousin at Nethergate. The cousin, Rosaleen, is jealous of her and due to the information given by her maid Pratt, she marries her off to an abusive returned soldier. The story follows her to an inn, through murder, into the service of a girls school, and back to Nethergate where Pratt now lives as a painful reminder of her past. The story is facinating in the way that Pulp Fiction is. You really don't know where it is going at first but you can't put it down. I would have given it 5 stars, but Norah Lofts always seems to ruin her own books in the last couple of pages."
3,Pretty solid (3 1/2 stars),"I love Tori Amos. This isn't the first CD of hers I bought--that was Under the Pink, which, coincidentally, was the very first CD I EVER bought--but I'm reviewing this one first. Anywho. The bad stuff first--I don't like ""China."" At all. I'm sorry, but it's just too slow for me. Also, ""Tear in Your Hand"" doesn't seem to ""fit"" with the rest of the tracks--it's too ""poppy,"" too ""top 40,"" too ""radio friendly."" Now, the good stuff. The really good tracks, IMHO, are ""Crucify,"" ""Leather,"" ""Happy Phantom,"" ""Winter"" (which makes me tear up a little), and ""Precious Things."" Those are my favorites. I actually HATED ""Silent All These Years"" for the longest time, when I heard it on the radio (then again, I was only about 12 or 13), but it started to grow on me, and I really like it now. I'm giving it 3 1/2 stars (Amazon, you really should allow half-star reviews) because I don't think it's perfect, yet it's pretty darned good."
5,A masterpiece of confessional genre music,"We are besieged with ""personal"" stories. Confessional weepy wunderkinds pouring out their little hearts trying to get us to feel sorry for them, to listen to them, to care. From Natacha Merritt's digital diaries to some of Ani DiFranco's more dopy songs, to the millions of internet diaries, people are confessing their souls.Too bad people can be so boring after a time.Thankfully, CDs like this one rise above the stupor and break your heart with a tire iron. The title song brings you pain. ""Silent All these Years"" is better than ""Ya outta know"" for bitchy breakup songs and the rest of the songs in this one are golden (except for maybe Leather. THat one kind of irritates me)Tori Amos has never done a CD this excellent before or afterwards but maybe she's happy these days and she's still trying to write angst."
5,Little Earthquakes,I think this may be my favorite Tori Amos cd. I love it & listen to it all the time & have had it for over a decade...
5,Tori's Beginnings,"This is Tori's First Album. (Besides her Y Kant Tori Read days) This album is incredibly emotional, comprised of mostly ballads like Winter, Silent All These Years, and Crucify, to her autobiographical song, Me and a Gun, which is based off of her rape by a fan who asked for a ride home one night. It has songs of comedic interest, such as Leather (Look I'm standing naked before you/don't you want more than my sex?/I can scream as loud as your last one/but I can't claim innocense/) and Happy Phantom. Over All, this is the album that got me hooked. Now I'm a DIE HARD Ears With Feet, and I can never get enough Tori! This CD is a MUST HAVE, unless you really just can't take emotion."
3,EXTREMELY OVERRATED,"Ok to start off, I am a huge Tori fan. But this is not her best work! This is not my favorite, even though it contains some gems like 'girl' precious things' and 'tear in your hand'. If you want to hear Tori best work up to date buy 'Boys for Pele'"
3,3 stars for good songwriting and competent piano playing...,...but somebody do something about all that whining! 'Nuff said.
1,Whine whine whine.....,"I don't understand what all the appeal is about this woman. I don't see any ""depth"" to her lyrics except whining about the past. Now, if this woman were to write songs about >overcoming< the past and moving on and becoming a whole person again, I might be a little more impressed, but ""Little Earthquakes"" seems to be filled with self-pity and angst. I guess that appeals to other people who like the same. ""I've been looking for a saviour beneath these dirty sheets"".... well, duh, did she find one?"
2,not as good as expected,"I didn't like this album that much. I thought that Tori's piano playing waz mediocre, and her singing was pretty good but a little too ""I'm sweet and perfect"" for me. Overall it wasn't bad, but since I had heard so much about her and how she was such a goddess, it was just completely overhyped for me. Another thing that irritates me is how she puts a nice picture of herself on the cover of every album of hers! She's playing off her physical beauty which just seems a little cheap, not that other ppl dont do that, and not that its wrong. But for a woman who is supposed to be ""super-cool"" and a good role model and have so much pain and sorrow to show the world, I think she could come up with something a little more creative. I wonder if she were ... ugly would she still put herself on the cover of all her albums?"
2,This SUX,I bought this album yesterday because of all the good reviews and i must say it is not wat i expected. I suggest that all u people that arent sure whether to buy it or not should not waste their money. I admit she has talent but its just not something that i like or that id recommend.
5,tOri<3,"I love this album, it is brilliant. It was the second album I ever got from Tori.Tori is my first love. I dont really know what else to say about it other than I dont even like this kind of music, but I adore Tori, and always will."
5,little earthquakes,"i never heard tori on the radio before i bought any of her cd's, in fact, i rarely hear her on the radio even now...i just went in to a store, picked a random CD to buy, and bought it. Little Earthquakes was it. I love it. This is a fabulous CD. I have since bought other CDs of her such as Boys for Pele, but i really think that this is her very best CD, and anyone first getting into tori should definitely buy this one first. it's one of my favorite CDs in my collection."
5,perfection,"This is perhaps Tori's greatest album, and it is truly written from thew bottom of her heart. Perhaps the most moving song, 'Me and a Gun' dosn't even need any backing instruments. How someone can write such a beautiful song from such a painful memory is beyond me. If you have a soul, and believe in real music written from the heart buy this album above any other. It truly is perfection."
4,bee-u-tiful,"Tori has such a lovely pure voice, and her lyrics are so earthy and real, something you can grasp in your hands."
1,She thinks she is Kate Bush,What a poor CD. I would much rather listen to Kate Bush. Tori really crosses the line with her Kate Bush impression.
5,NO WORDS COULD EXPLAIN,"I bought this album in 1992 when I was 17. 9 years later, at 26, it is the only album I *still* listen to religiously. You will never get tired of her."
5,A quirky masterpiece,"Not since Mozart has a person played the piano as well as Tori Amos. Wait, that's an understatement. Tori is a virtuoso. Every song here is a work of enchantment. Tori offers you to close your eyes and escape into the world of farerie where mermaids have jeans, Charles Manson eats ice cream, and all it takes is a cracker to get there. There is no way to say how much this incredible woman has touched my life and she's one of my most important role models. She doesn't write songs in a formulatic verse-chorus-verse, she makes complicated chord structures and tacks on oddball bits and ends. This may aggravate some who think that the words make no sense but to me it's absolutely enchanting. As Mrs. Amos has said herself, ""The stories have a different meaning for everyone. Each person can visulalize their own myths."" Anyway, my personal favorites are Crucify, Leather, Silent all these years, Girl, and Happy Phantom."
4,An impressive debut of an original artist.,"Tender, intense, nostalgic, charming, violent, grieving, and some other characteristics define Tori Amos' style. ""Little Earthquakes"" is just a(n excellent) introduction of how much this brilliant singer could do. She has opened her background to the world, being always open and honest, no matter the sad (and sometimes violent) lyrics. Kate Bush, Sinead O'Connor, Joni Mitchel, and (in my oppinion) Nick Cave may have been Tori's examples and inspiration, but she has shown that she has enough personality to not being a mere copy of them (like a lot of post-Tori singers are of herself). Here is where the story of one of the greatest artists of the last 30 years has just begun."
5,the best album ever,All I have to say is that I own about 400 CDs and this is the best of them all. An absolutely incredible album all the way through. It is so rare to find a female be so revealing on an album let alone even write her own music. In a music world full of empty pop bubbleheads and plagirism it is amazing to think how much this album can stand out. Tear In Your Hand is the best song on here. I can't believe it wasnt released as a single but I guess it is too good for that.
3,I would have given it three and a half...,"It's a very good album, don't get me wrong. It's worthy of three and a half stars, possibly four had she not denied any influence from Kate Bush and put ""Me and a Gun"" on the album and ""Little Earthquakes"" for that matter. Anyone who knows Miss Bush would recognize Tori's blatant influence (or should I say stealing?) of her style. With that said, this album otherwise is very good. The ballads ""China"" and ""Winter"" are well done. ""Crucify"", ""Girl,"" and ""Silent All These Years"" also stand out on this album. My advice is to buy this album if you like a Kate clone or if you've never heard Kate. Hard-core original Kate fans might be a little ticked, though..."
3,not my favourite,"Little Earthquakes is not my favourite album. I think the b-sides that were left off of the album (Flying Dutchman, Take to the Sky, Upside Down) should have been left on the record. Girl, Winter, Tear In Your Hand, Little Earthquakes and Mother are amazing. The rest are ok for me, but this is still a really good album, I just wish they had let her keep all of the ones that got kicked off on. One thing that I will say about this album is that it has a certain rawness and darkness to it, as well as truly powerhouse emotional performances."
3,"Good, but get Scarlet's Walk first..","My very first Tori Amos album was Scarlet's Walk and since then I have been a fan. As I read the reviews for Little Earthquakes, I noticed a lot of people recommending this album to be the first for new fans. Although it is a very good album, I disagree that it is her best and/or most accessible. There are some great songs on here, highlights being the scorching Crucify and Little Earthquakes, truly terrifying Precious Things, tender ballads Silent All These Years, Winter, and the sentimental and beautiful China. The other songs take multiple listens to become attached to, but overall a solid and brilliant album. However, the material didn't capture my imagination to the extent that Scarlet's Walk did, and I fear had Little Earthquakes been my first Tori album, I wouldn't have progressed onward to her other masterpieces."
5,Close to Perfect - YES - GET THIS FIRST,"Ignore the poster who tells you not to get this first. It is truly her best work. Scarlet's Walk is an incredible CD as well, but this is the one that got me hooked over 10 years ago. This is the one that will make you a Tori Amos fan. If you are just finding out who she is because her music has unfortunately been played on too many mainstream radio stations - then go back to earlier CDs and found out what her music is really all about. You won't regret it."
5,"Her best album, and that's saying rather a lot.","While her other albums may be more technically skilled, nowhere else does she sing her heart out as on this recording. Virtually every song is hauntingly lovely, with intelligent lyrics that delve into subjects rarely explored in the popular music world. ""China"", ""Crucify"", ""Silent All These Years""... the list goes on and on. The raw emotions she displays are, at times, heartbreaking.It's probably my favorite album of all time, and utterly deserving of that title."
5,it changed my life,When I saw this video at first I thought who is this woman . I found her strange at first but felt compelled to keep watching and as I saw the video I liked Silent all these years more and more then I had to have the album .And I love to this day every song and it's rare to find albums like that today . I have bought every Tori Amos cd since and love each one as she grew I grew with her .I think this is a great piece to any music lovers collection. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do .
5,the ultimate,"Tori Amos has changed my life forever.since i discovered her,my life has never been the same.Tori's music is simply out of this world.I cant imagine listen to anyone else when i discovered her music 4 years ago,and this album is the intro for me to walk in Tori's world.Her music is total honesty and she speaks every detail of her life without being so predictable.I listen to this album everyday and every time i listen to it, its like a new experience.Tori's music takes you to a new high and her incredible honesty can make other wannabe singer songwriters looks like cartoons.I dont have a paticular favourite song,because all of Tori's songs are precious,they speaks in their own rights.Its pure magical!"
4,The point of view of a teenage american girl,"Every song on this album is heart felt, the lyrics complex and intriging. Although the music itself is simple, I think it is important to note that Tori Amos is not another female, piano playing- singer. She makes interesting references to god and her spirituality; each song is unique in its content. An important song to note is the second to last on the album, 'me and a gun', where Amos interprets the story of her own rape into music. If you are looking for something entertaining, soothing, and at the same time a CD that is thought provoking- Tori Amos' 'Little Earthquakes' should be the end of that search."
5,Was the World Ready for This?,"With vocals inspired by the legendary Robert Plant, and a background of ecclectic musical background, Tori Amos puts on an emotionally poignant display with her absolute command of her keyboards and the human heart. This album goes beyond genre, and resurrects the simplicity of musical greatness, depending on real talent, skill, and soul rather than showmanship.""Tear in Your Hand"" blasts away at the stony crust of a heart that has forgotten love, while making the apology that ""there are pieces of me you've never seen."" Touching all the bittersweet capacity of the human soul, Tori Amos' comes back to the music scene in an explosion."
5,I'm blown away,"As a non-die hard Tori fan, I own 3 of her CDs, and this is not only my favorite of the three but my favorite CD all in all. No one else has captivated every emotion on one CD. Her lyrics are intense and multi-layered, her music is phenominally rich and colourful and ranges from ecstatically happy to mournfully sad and hits everywhere in between. But I have recommended this CD to two people who were less than pleased, so listen before you buy. If you like the Amazon.com clips, you'll love the CD and it's well worth the money."
4,Little Earthquakes - Tori Amos,"A beautiful CD, especially when I'm relaxing.The music reminds me on Kate Bush's melodious & powerful songs."
4,Beautiful album!,"I remember seeing this the music video for Silent All these years, and thinking it was on of the best music videos ever written. This is def. a must have for anybody that loves 90's music or singer song writer type music. I don't remember the titles of the tracks, but I do remember the album has a nice calm, but sad feel to the album. You can tell that she's trying to get something off of her chest, but she wants to express it in a positive way. I also liked little earthquakes. I loved the passion in her voice. I really like Tori Amos work and it's really just some good quinesstional 90's pop music."
5,This is the one.,"If your looking for the best of Tori, this is the one. She has four full length cd's and this one is the best representation of her work. You will always want more but sadly this is all she wrote. Her ""Boys for Pele"" comes close but it doesn't hit the message so frankly."
4,Essensual,"4 1/2Lacking Amazon's almighty (and predictable) ""essential"" preface here would almost seem an indictment on a male-centric music press. She would go on to make far more daring work(pros and cons included), but when it comes to important (female) artists with compositional chops that were refined as they are accessible, few debuts felt as essential as this."
3,Very touching,I enjoyed this album. I liked the mellow focused mood. It is a great worship cd. I would have loved to have been there for the recording.
4,This is a must have for Jeremy Camp fans,"I originally bought this CD because I thought it would be like the Jeremy Camp concert I went to shortly before the release of 'Restored', but I was surprised to find out that it wasn't. It was better!!! The faster songs on this disc('Stay', 'Understand') are slowed way down and the electric guitars are replaced with acoustics. When I first heard 'Understand' I knew I had to have this CD. This is one of my favorites. I wouldn't be shocked if he gets a Dove Award nomination for this one!"
4,Agree with most everything......,"Let me say that I agree with almost everything positive expressed by others already. I'll just round out the comments a bit by commenting a little on the technical nature of this DVD. I found the camera work a bit distracting. For my tastes there were too many quickly moving camera angles. Made it hard to focus on the guy singing the music - like you would at a concert. There was also a lot of moving between B&W, out-of-focus, introduction of scratches/spots to replicate damaged film, graininess, etc. Seemed like the post production people wanted to use all the toys in the digital editing toolbox. The soundtrack is also only in stereo. Not bad, in fact, very good but certainly not up to the DD 5.1 standards of other DVD's such as the Eagles. So yes, it's very good but not quite 5 stars."
1,No bargain even at half price,"When I ordered these in early Jan/08, they were for just over $50. I see that they are now at $99!! I was really looking forward to this ""great bargain"". Just imagine my disappointment when opening the box yielded a plain, poorly made product. There are leather flaws that look like scuff marks over several parts on both shoes. The style is much more pedestrian and old school than the shiny picture suggests. At any price, this was a poor buy. I returned them on the same day without even trying them on."
3,"Look great, hoping they are more comfortable after break in.","Great looking shoes but they do pinch a bit on the heal. I have some heal gel pads that have really minimized discomfort in the heal, but I'm hoping that they break in a bit and eliminate all discomfort. Another pair of Kenneth Cole shoes I own were also a little uncomfortable at first, but they are now broken in and are one of my favorite pairs. Also, the sole needs a non-skid patch. Otherwise they can be slippery to walk in on dusty or wet surfaces. For looks alone, these shoes would get 5 stars."
2,webster's new explorer large pring dictionary,The large print was fine but there are certain words which can't be found in this dictionary.
4,easy to read,It is a very basic dictionary with very limited meanings to each word listed. But easy on the eyes for people with vision problems. Good book though.
5,webster large print dictionary,I love it so easy to see what your trying to look up! It was my Mothers day gift to myself.
2,Culturally Biased and Missing Some Basic Words,"There are quite a few basic words missing from this dictionary, and there's a definite slant toward Judao-Christian representation. I guess it's not a big deal, but you would hope a dictionary would be more objective. For example Yom Kippur and Good Friday are defined, but not Ramadan? Strange. Good book all-in-all, but it would be nice if it represented a wider cross-section of cultures and words (I needed to find the spelling for 'incontinent', and it wasn't listed?!) - especially as a learning tool."
1,Webster's New Explorer Large Print Dictionary,I am very disappointed in this dictionary. I suppose the fact that it is large print makes it difficult to get as many words in as in a regular dictionary. I would not buy it again! My husband has not used the Other dictionary and thesaurus that came in the package.
2,Too basic,Found this dictionary to be too basic. I already knew the meaning of most of the words listed.
2,Wordless dictionary.,"Easy to read. Too many words/definitions are absent. The definitions that do appear are simplistic at best. If you need a good dictionary, look elsewhere. There are plenty."
5,Great gift for all your older friends and family!,"A friend was about to celebrate a birthday and I pondered over a ""little something"" to send her. I remembered a conversation we had recently had where in she said she didn't look forward to writing letters any longer because she couldn't easily read her dictionary. Always the perfectionist, she didn't want to send a letter that had misspelled words. The Webster's large print dictionary was the perfect birthday gift. My friend is so happy to have this dictionary! She doesn't even have to have her reading glasses on to see the large print. She is back to writing letters to friends and confided she has her dignity back! She felt embarrassed and hated having to ask others haw to spell something...especially her grandchildren. A complete dictionary and such a small price. A real value!"
4,Webster's New Explorer Large Print Dictionary,I am pleased with this book I just wish it had more words in it. I love the large print and the size of the book itself. It arrived in record time as everything I've ever ordered from Amazon has.
5,Great book for the price.,This was for a friend who needs large print due to aging eyes. She is delighted with it. I plan to get another for my wife.
1,Webster's New Large Print Explorer Large Print Dictionary New Edition,This dictionary is far to basic to be useful to me. The font size is O.K. I should have realized by the price that it would be very simple. I will give it to our local library for their book sale. The error was on my part. Lee Searles
5,GREAT,THE DICTIONARY WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR - THE LARGE PRINT WAS A GREAT HELP FOR ME - BECAUSE OF MY EY SIGHT
4,great album for dinner parties indeed,"This album is perfect for a dinner party if you like having a little Japanse noise with your foie gras Beluga caviar. This album is not very consistent, but well worth its price for the first two brilliant tracks alone. The album features experimental turtablist Otomo Yoshihide's blistering beats, coupled with soaring, plaintive, almost ethereral vocals. If you like this stuff, you would probably like Otomo Yoshihide's work with the group Ground Zero, which is more rocking."
5,fascinating!,"I was fascinated by Rachel's personal accounts of her past healings. I never realized all that is involved in spiritual healing and how Rachel's experiences have taught her so much knowledge of the body, spirit, mind and the entire medical field. She is truly a professional in this field.I've read a couple other books about spiritual healing and they have similar techniques and outcomes which relieved skepticism I had towards the spirtual healing practice. Futhermore, I recently attended a presentation by Rachel and I volunteered for a brief body scan. I was amazed at the energy I felt by her simply placing her palms near to my body. I was a skeptic before, but no longer.I was also impressed by all the different spiritual techniques she covers from acupuncture to reading of the palms. Her illustrations and descriptions are easy to follow and understand and will make for a good reference.I highly recommend this book.Mary K."
4,Ending my pain,"I really hate going to the doctors and this book just gave me the best option on saving not only time but money. With simple techniques she shows you, how to get to a healthier life style."
5,Muy Buen LIbro,"Este es un buen libro para aprender a aliviar ciertos dolores y malestares atravez de reflexologia, presionando areas en tus manos y pies que tienen un efecto directo con los organos y areas del resto de tu cuerpo."
3,great price but inadequate volume,"I don't expect much from a cheap 13"" TV, and this one has a perfectly fine picture, remote control, input-output jacks, etc. My only quibble is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough to make it possible to hear quieter stations or programs, even from only 6 feet away.It sucks to not be able to hear Jim Lehrer or whoever while I'm washing dishes, which is what I bought the thing for.I know my TV's speakers are OK because the volume is fine on most channels. But it should be able to compensate for lower-volume channels, as every other TV I've ever used has.Oh well."
2,Disappointed with this leap pad book,"My 6 year old daughter received this book for her birthday. In the past we'd gotten lead pad 1 and 2 level books which have been great. She loves the Wizard of Oz so I hoped this would be a good purchase. The story cannot be read to you (like the earlier leap pads) unless you want to go word for word with the pen. My older daughter (age 9) read the story and enjoyed it, but I would have rather just gotten a Wizard of Oz book. I don't see any benefit to buying the leap pad verison (there are no games or activities to enhance the story - just comprehension questions at the end of each chapter)."
5,Excellent Music!,"This is an excellent collection of some of Zeppelin's best. From 1969-75, it's all here, with the hits such as ""Whole Lotta Love,"" ""Heartbreaker,"" ""Rock and Roll,"" ""Stairway to Heaven,"" and my favorite, ""Kashmir"" all on here. It's a great set to get if you don't have any Zeppelin CD's or if you haven't bought the 4-CD box set. A definite buy in my opinion!"
4,Question,"Is this the album in which ""Stairway to Heaven"" is an instrumental? Played with an electric guitar for about 5 1/2 minutes."
1,The most overrated band EVER,"Note to poential buyers-Led Zeppelin are considered a ""classic"" rock band. ""Classic"" is not the same as ""good"".There are about two decent songs in this compilation. Don't waste your money on this nonsense folks."
4,zepplinmania,"I'm a Led Zepplin fanatic. If you are interested in buying Zepplin's music and don't have the cash to shell out for the 4 CD box set (or all the individual studio allbums), then this is a must purchase. The versality and artistic abilities of the bands members are captured on ""Remasters,"" and the sound quality is superb."
4,Led Zeppelin's Greatest Hits.,"I put 4 stars because I feel that they just shouldve put this out as a double disc set and ditch the ""interviews"" disc. And [get rid of] the ""Early Days"" and ""Latter Days"" and there you have it. the perfect ""Greatest Hits"" compilation of Zeppelin. Good selections too. My only complaint is they should've replaced ""Dyer Maker"" (which just sounds like pop to me) with ""Over The Hills & Far Away""."
3,not the best,"All that you need to know is that this is not the best compilation of Zep's music to get. It is too expensive, the 3rd CD is useless and obviously has no replay value since it is only interviews which all start ""Hi, I'm Jimmy Page and this is led Zepplin."" The choice of music is good but definetly not the best. THEY DIDN""T CAPTURE the SPIRIT of Led Zeppelin. They give hints to what they are about, but this is a CD that really can't even be played loud while driving down the interstate in a convertible. But a different CD."
4,More Standards from Norma,"Here's another fine outing from Norma Winstone with pianist John Taylor. On ""...like song, like weather"" Norma sings the works of Ellington, Gershwin, Brubeck, Bley, Wheeler and others. For me , her version of the LaTouche/Moross tune ""Lazy Afternoon"" is worth the price of admission.( Don't miss the Blue Note recording ""Basra"" by Pete La Roca for the same tune performed in 1965 by Pete with Joe Henderson, Steve Kuhn, and Steve Swallow. Very nice!) The Kenny Wheeler tune ""Everbody's Song But My Own"" is another favorite of mine. Norma and John sound real fine again. Who's surprised? And if you like this you may want to look for the triple CD set of the works of Azimuth ( not Azymuth! ) on ECM at something of a bargain price. I recently bought this and have been very happy re acquainting myself with Azimuths' early works."
1,"Unclear description, having problem returning","This product is not made with the new Ipod Nano, 3rd generation in mind.I'm having trouble returning the unopened package. JR rep told me they didn't recognize this item sold through Amazon, and Amazon told me to contact JR, which I did without success. Do not buy unless you know exactly what you're getting.Belkin iPod Accessory Car Kit"
1,I wouldn't buy this again,For the money it doesn't work well enough. I don't use it anymore because I can't find a station that allows my iPod to play well - I always end up with static. I'm considering a new stereo in my car instead. I do not recommend buying this item.
3,Edson's Raiders: The 1st Marine Raider Battalion in World War II,This was a very informative book. I found it a slow read but interesting information.
3,A rather depressing book,"I found this book really depressing. The main story is on Sam Brentwood being in a Hawaiian prison simply for supporting the Hawaiian queen. Janessa's tasks at Ellis Island is also dismal.Still, I liked the love story of Mike and Eden's; it's the only thing that makes this book remotelt readable."
5,pleased,Great movie....I found the movie did an amazinly accurate job in depicting how we all can love some one in spite of who/what they are not just because of who/what they are.
3,"Long, slow, but sophisticated","I once heard someone say that British films usually include a large amount of significant stares, opening and closing doors, and lots and lots of tea. Despite all that (or maybe because of that), I am usually a fan of British television and theatre. This is the first time I've been so disappointed. Almost Strangers (US)/Perfect Strangers (UK) traces and interweaves the stories of a dozen family members who are gathered at a large family reunion. The story is subtle, sophisticated and eventually even intriguing, but it is also painfully long, slow to gain momentum and, at times, absolutely puzzling. When you finally reach the end, several loose ends are not tied up so it is not particularly satisfying. It really is a matter of taste, but I would say that if you are a person who needs to understand a movie early on and who wants a quick moving story, look elsewhere."
2,"Reasonable Actors, Disappointing Script and Themes","This was a very slow moving film. The background music gave the impression that something sinister was about to happen in almost every scene. The actors were reasonable, but I don't feel that the script did them any justice. The nudity scene in the first part of the film was completely unexpected and completely unnecessary. I will be returning the DVD set for a complete refund. There should be appropriate warnings when DVDs contain nudity and bad language as this one does. Why is nudity and bad language necessary in a good script. Their presence is an added indication of the poverty of this work."
5,MEET THE FAMILY,"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. WELL DONE BY ALL THE ACTORS & ACTRESSES. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE MATTHEW MACFADYEN IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MODE THAN THE ONE HE HAD PLAYED IN ""PRIDE & PREJUDICE."" IT CENTERED ON 3 DIFFERENT FAMILIES AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM AND WHAT EFFECT IT HAD ON THE REST OF THE FAMILIES. I FOUND IT FASCINATING."
3,Almost Strangers DVD,"A little difficult to follow at times but if you hang in there it turns out to be a very entertaining view. MacFayden is great, as usual."
2,English Teacher TT,This was a disappointment. The tremendously talented actors and the interesting story premise could not make up for the fact that the film contained nudity and objectionable language. Beware of this NR film if those things offend you.
1,Almost Strangers,"I have at least a 1000 DVDs and this one is, by far, the worst especially for the price of $24.95. It is very confusing, too many plots that make no sense at all, could have been filmed in half the time, etc. I could go on and on but I just want to stick it in a drawer and forget about it. Amazon should have a policy that frequent buyers should be able to return at least one DVD that STINKS."
5,"wow, works great! much better then the edc pads I have tried before!","wow, works great! much better then the edc pads I have tried before! I would highly suggest them to anyone!"
1,Don't buy this toy,This toy is very cheaply made. I really have no idea what the manufacturer was thinking when they designed the clothing for this doll. It's so super tight that it's impossible to get it over the rubber legs. The second time we tried to get her dressed the inside of the rubber leg actually snapped. My 5 year old gets so frustrated with this doll... it was a terrible purchase and I don't recommend this to anyone.
5,Beautiful Publication!,Dori Chaconas never disappoints with her thoughtful and poignant stories. This one especially fits the bill! A tremendous and loving story between parent and child that is timeless. Her poetic rhythmic writing is enough to warm any heart on a cold winter's day.
4,Absolutely Outstanding CD,"This is an absolutely outstanding CD. Patrizia is an excellent pianist and songwriter. The CD features 11 songs with artisits such as Jim Seeley(trumpet, flugelhorn), Mark Gross(alto and soprano sax and clarinet) and Ada Rovatti(tenor sax) playing on various tunes. The rhythm section is held up nicely by Bob Bowen and Carlos Cervantes. Standout songs on the CD include Reveries, People Like Us, Uptown Bossa and Life and Death. A superb CD, lots of variety and melodic adventures."
4,curtains,"The product is fine. The shipment and delivery were not - it took almost a month for this company to ship this order, and I was no longer at the address I'd indicated. Also, this company's website was confusing, and I wound up with extras of pieces I did not need because it was unclear what was in each package. I must return extra pieces, and because the delivery was so late, I have missed their 30-day return cutoff. I will not use this vendor again. Ann Miller"
3,Trapped in a Purple Haze,"A very good video with Hayden Christensen in a supporting role. Though his part was not major to the film you could see he had ""something."" A must for Hayden fans."
5,good quality,Challenging for younger kids since it has more pieces but not frustrating since the pieces are fairly large. Good for 4-6 year old who likes puzzles.
2,not very informative or useful,"This book develops a basic theoretical ""framework"" for how community development occurs in the first chapter. The following chapters elaborate on each aspect of the developed framework with detailed real-life examples and suggestions. The entire book is summed up in the 1st 6 pages of the final chapter. Unless you need the detailed examples, you could read those 6 pages instead of buying the book.As a reference book for community developers I would cautiously recommend this book (I say cautiously because I really have no idea what community developers would need in a book). As a sociological text I would not recommend this book. The framework that the authors developed does not really reference other authoritative sociological theories and the framework is much too complicated to be useful."
4,Son de Vieques - putting music to history,"The people of Vieques, of the Puerto Rican nation, of people in solidarity with them throughout the world, struggled for years to stop the U.S. Navy destruction of the island. The navy finally decided to stop using the island as a target practice territory and left. This music is a chronicle of that struggle and with the quality of excellent musicians."
4,Love Quantum!,"I think we have all the books/cartridges at this point; I also don't think they're making these Quantum sets anymore! A shame, if that's true, because they are FUN for the kids, educational, and reasonably priced. Lots of interactive fun with a ""computer game"" as my youngest calls it, without aggravating the parents. It travels well, too."
5,Phenomenal CD,I bought this CD having only a vague idea of who Galactic is and what kind of music they play. This CD rocks! It's pretty New Orleans-flavored funk/jazz with some bite. I highly recommend it.
4,Buy this CD!,"This is a great CD! It would get 5 stars from me, but I save that for Miles Davis or John Coltrane. I heard it featured, briefly, in a story on NPR about a producer's annual barbecue, at which he plays music that has caught his ear for the party crowd. GALACTIC had, maybe, a 20-second spot on the segment. I was hooked. I bought the CD later that week and have not looked back. The only big question about this CD is whether it is my wife's car or mine!If you like Was Not Was, if you like funk, if you like James Brown, George Clinton, or Sly Stone, if you like Ronald Shannon Jackson, for pete's sake, buy this CD! You owe it to yourself."
2,Poor Mastering,"While the mastering on this one isn't as dreadful as on ""From the Corner to the Block"", it is bad. There is a large amount of dynamic compression, a fair amount of distortion and clipping. All in all, I give the mastering a 2 out of 5. I'll leave it for the other reviewers to review the music.I bought 4 Galatic disks, and only one of them was shown care and attention when being mastered and that was ""Coolin' Off"". Batting .250, cest la vie.Oh and if you want to know more, look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia."
3,Get rid of Houseman!,"I should start by saying that I love Galactic and have seen them many times from New Orleans to Connecticut and points between. Coolin' Off, their first CD, is still their best. In both their live shows and CDs, the more Theryl sings, the less I like it. His tunes always throw a wrench in the works and kill the buzz. He sings more on this disc than the prior two, and the result is a less consistent product. STICK TO THE FUNK BOYS, and lose this Lou Rawls wannabe."
5,Galactic is Godlike,"Okay, maybe not quite that amazing, but this is still a great album. From the first track to the last, this album is definitely solid in terms of grooves. Stanton Moore lays down great tracks on this album. Villified, Baker's Dozen, Doubliewide, and Black Eyed Pea are all great tracks. Buy this album. Now."
2,Happy Never After,"I have read all the books I could find from this author, written under Mary Kay Andrews, all of them were great, although this one ""Happy Never After"" did not live up to the quality as all her other books, but then again this is just my opinion. And all her books written under Mary Kay Andrew are worth the reading."
3,Another Callahan Garrity mystery,"This is another Callahan Garrity murder/mystery. Callahan Garrity is still in charge of the House Mouse, her successful house cleaning service, when she receives a mysterious call to help find a missing woman from a 1960's singing group.The group is being signed up to appear in a movie and Callahan gets involved to find the missing singer. Along the way, she stumbles on a murder and then is asked by the defending lawyer to help him with the murder case.In the end Callahan solves the murder and finds the missing singer. This is light and enjoyable reading. The story takes place in the early 1990's so it is somewhat dated now.Good for a light beach read."
4,Fun and learning for more than two years,"Was a gift for my 6-month-old girl and she still enjoys it at age 3. She liked:- chewing and handling the blocks (the are sturdy and safe and very lightly dyed. No flaky paint)- being read the nursery rhymes- putting all the blocks in a bag and taking them out.As she grew older, she learned to recognize the rhymes by the pictures and is having fun trying to say the rhymes herself.However, she never liked to stack the blocks and never played with them for longer than about 15 minutes at a time - they have never been her favourite toy, just something she's always liked. I love playing with them myself though!"
2,Very drying,"I was excited for the smell, and that is the best thing about this hand soap. It is so very drying. We still have a bottle of Dial foaming handsoap and so the difference in just how drying method soap is is easily comparable. Also, the number of handwashes per bottle is half of the Dial! That does not make this a good value, since the price per bottle is the same or more! I won't be buying this brand again. Just 5 more bottles to go through...sigh."
1,Didn't work,"Got one for Xmas. Didn't work out of the package. Now I have to go through the WHOLE RETURN BY MAIL PROCESS to get a refund. It will be 7-14 days before I get my money back and can buy some other brand. You had your chance, TDK."
3,Firmware Upgrade???,"It worked great, until one day it didn't, and I can't read the error message, and I get no help from tech support. I tried to download the firmware upgrade, but it was nowhere to be found.All in all, it is a good MP3 player for the prize (as long as it works), and it doubles as a portable storage device.Also, I am not a big fan of the cable connection. It means cerrying the cable around if you want to use it as a flash drive, and make sure you don't lose it."
1,DOES NOT PLAY DRM FILES!!!,"will not play the new DRM WMA files that you download from places like walmart.com or other online music stores........if your not sure, read the sites FAQ'S/HELP to see if it can only play on DRM equipped players...."
3,"This is not an autoharp, it's a zither","An autoharp is something with keys you press to create chords while you strum a number of strings, like early country music star Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family used for years. This is not one of those. This item is a zither, on which you pluck one string at a time to produce one note. There IS a difference.Having said that, I bought one of these a few years ago and found it very easy to use, thanks to the music sheets you can slide beneath the strings so you can see which strings to pluck. It's important to keep it in tune (it can get out of tune over use and/or time), but it's pleasant enough to listen to.If you're just starting out to play music on a string instrument and find the guitar a little daunting, this isn't a bad way to begin learning. Just make sure you're getting one at the right price, and DON'T expect to play chords on it...it's not built for that."
4,good music fun!,"My 7-year old son got this for Christmas, but it's fun for everyone in the family. He played with it quite a bit right away, but then he tightened a string a little too much and it broke. There is extra string (actually wire) included, so I was able to fix it without too much difficulty. But there's probably only enough string to do that one more time. Maybe it is simple to find at the hardware store, I don't know. That is the only problem we've had. I would still buy it again, we've really liked it."
5,"I love these so much I created World of Harmony Music, a music curriculum for children!","I bought a Music Maker zither, or lap harp, twelve years ago, when my daughter was only 2. She immediately loved the instrument, could easily play beautiful music on it, and would take it with her to play for friends and family in their homes. Being a professional musician myself, I was so impressed that I decided to create an educational music curriculum for children, using these instruments! You can see my books here on Amazon. Just look for World of Harmony Music."
3,muchee-tunee,"Got this little Zither (thats what it actually is) about a year ago as a gift. As an already experienced musician, I found it fun and charming, sounding like a waterfall to me. My family loves to hear it played, though they are not inclined to try it themselves. Good as an introductory instrument or as something just to strum peacefully at the end of a day. It's major drawback is tuning. I don't know what the design flaw is or if it is in the type of wood used, but whatever the flaw is - it allows the instrument to fall out of tune very quickly. One problem, I think, is the system whereby two notes share a string so that when one 'string' falls out of tune its twin does also. Fun and easy, but buy with caution and use with patience. I can't recommend it, but I would not discourage the purchase of it."
1,Piece of Junk,For $40 you'd think it would at least be able to be tuned. You cannot tune it and the sound of TINNY. Do not buy this.
2,It would be such a great harp if it would just stay tuned for more than an instant,"Bought this for a musical show and tell for my son and he loves it. The music sheets are fun and he adores picking out tunes. The only problem is that I can't make this thing stay in tune for long at all. And by long, I mean more than a few songs. I would love this harp if only it would stay in tune. Even staying in tune for a day or two would be better."
1,Poor,I purchased the item as a used product and it arrived rusted and out of tune. I returned it immediately.
1,bad autoharp,"well, i was really looking forward to using this on some special recordings, not only did it come in so out of tune that its almost untunable due to the lack of a tuning key, which i never recieved and the strings are practically rusted. its going to cost me more to fix it then the item cost."
4,helpful introduction and tips,"A nice book to learn about the ISAT tests. It gives concise reviews of what kids needs to know, so you can check their readiness. The test taking tips are very useful for first-timers to raise scores. A very helpful warm-up for both parents and kids. Note that such a thin book doesn't do much to improve math or reading. That requires daily learning in school and study in home. There is a nice web site http://www.beestar.org you can use to assess your child's skills step by step. With the fundamentals in place, this book is a nice warm-up."
1,Poor quality product,"My partner bought this ring for me for our 7th anniversary. I LOVED the design of this ring, and loved wearing it because it received so many compliments!HOWEVER, it started to tarnish very quickly and after nine months, the stone had started to loosen. Last week, somewhere between home and work, the prongs bent and the stone fell out. I was very careful not to wear this ring in water, when using household chemicals, or when doing anything that might have caused damage to the ring (like gardening or moving furniture). While I recognize that this isn't exactly the Hope Diamond, I wish that the ring would have lasted longer than (almost) one year.My partner ordered a new ring for me from another company, and made sure that this time the ring was made of sterling silver NOT brass. We shall see."
4,Wedding Ring Set,"I like both rings, but they did get scratched pretty fast. Not really a big deal though. I still wear them."
4,Wedding ring,"I like the ring. I got it really quick, and it was very affordable. The size was perfect, so I didn't have to have it fitted. No complaints."
2,my fingers green,when i searched this ring i was searching for sterling silver... i didnt read where it said it was brass until i got on here today. the ring is pretty but i wanted to wear this to the pool and on vacation afraid i would loose my real diamond. cant really do that with this ring since it turns you green after a couple days.
2,not very impressed,"Well, it arrived two and a half weeks after it was supposed to. There is no way you can wear both rings at the same time without them looking ridiculously huge and awkward!! You can tell they are not real, also after paying shipping and handling online, I had to pay another $15 for shipping when the rings arrived. I recommend looking around a little more, perhaps with a different dealer."
2,ho hum,"I thought the cover and one-liner reviews inside sounded promising. But the book turned out to be a bit of a yawn. Characters and ideas are introduced and then never go anywhere. Relationships between characters that had a lot of potential are skimmed over. Strange ""science"" (eg one character can actually somehow be two different beings at once) are tossed in with no explanation. I finished it, which is more than I can say for some books. But there's way more enteraining stuff out there."
2,Not nearly enough bikinis. Could use more planets too.,"I admit it. The blurb by Neil Gaiman amused me enough to buy this book. I notice in retrospect that he says nothing about the actual story.Unfortunately, you spend most of this book doubting the veracity of any plot related information you receive. Or, in fact, any world related information you receive. Everybody is an unreliable narrator except, presumably, the two PoV characters. It's annoying in the same way that the conversation with the first year philosophy student is after he's discovered the idea that all evidence comes through your senses, which may be deceived. It doesn't help that nobody keeps the same name for more than two pages.I spent .... probably the middle half of the book waiting to see if it got bad enough that I could justify putting it down. And then, the last quarter of the book, I did actually want to find out what happened so I finished it. So... that's a good thing, I guess."
1,Horrible. And very short on bikinis.,"Billing itself as campy fun, this was, instead, pure kaka. And not in a good way.It wasn't cheesy, it was simply bad. And with a title like ""Bikini Planet"", you'd expect some titilation - yet the book didn't even deliver in that department, really.Dull and disappointing in every way. My biggest surprise was that I actually read the thing."
1,Not worth the import.,"I purchased this CD because I LOVED the song ""Destined to be"". That is the ONLY song worth any money on the whole CD. Seems she is a one hit wonder with every CD she makes. :o("
3,"""High"" Dream","Dreamhouse by Alison Habens was one of the weirdest novels I have ever read. The book caught my attention because I thought I would be able to relate to the main character (Celia Small) by the way she dreams about what her engagement party would be like and how she had been planning the event since she was little. But as I got further into the book I found out that things did not go as planned because half of the people that surrounded Celia were ""high"" (on drugs), including her! I do not do drugs nor do I enjoy reading about people who do, but if that is your cup of tea then this is your book. As a novel I give Dreamhouse three stars, but I do not recommend it to anyone."
3,If Video Doesn't Work (ipods) Try this...,"I almost returned this product because I couldn't get it to work with my 30g video ipod and then found the following in the reviews for another similar product. Hope it helps someone else:""The AV Cable allows you to connect your iPod/iPhone with color screen to your home entertainment system. Now you can view your videos, pictures or slideshows with audio on your home television.Setting Up Your iPod Video Options Before Watch iPod Video on TV1.Turn on your iPod, choose Videos -> Video Settings from your main iPod menu. This screen will show three settings: TV Out, TV Signal and Widescreen.2.Select TV Out, make sure you select ""On"" that will produce TV signal.3.TV Signal: If you live in the U.S., your TV works with the NTSC standard. European countries mostly use PAL.4.Widescreen: You can choose ""On"" to produce a widescreen signal (16:9), or ""off"" to export the traditional TV output (4:3)."""
2,Audio No Video on Samsung Vibrant,"I'm only basing this review on the fact bought these for my Samsung Vibrant phone TV out function. Like another reviewer said here(shame on me for not listening) audio works fine but video looks like the Spice channel did if you didn't pay for it back in the day. If you got a vibrant don't get these,unless course you only want audio.."
4,"Good value, nice product, packaged well.","This is a great quality Maxell product that is exactly as described and a good value. Can be used with many various devices needing a 3.5mm to RCA cable.Comes in the retail package, but much cheaper here.Seller shipped quickly, too.Recommended."
3,At least part of it worked,"I got this product for my Samsung Vibrant phone to stream music in my car as well as watch movies and videos on my TV. The 3.5mm cable works fine, so I can stream music in my car. But something is wrong with the splitter, I can't get anything to play on the TV. Not worth the money, for only half of the product working. Disappointed!"
2,Works - barely,"Immediately out of the packaging, the connections are loose. One wire needs to be wiggled for the stereo sound to work correctly.For the price, it's adequate, but I would suggest getting the next level of quality up from this one."
1,not for ipod touch!,bought this and couldnt figure it out so i brought it to radio shack and the guy there told me it cannot work with an ipod touch at all!
2,iphone problem,"I got this to connect the iphone to the speaker system. Unfortunately, it does not work with the iphone. The connectors are not deep enough to fit it, and the sound kept coming out of the phone only. To confirm I wasnt doing the wrong this, I put the another connector and things worked correctly."
1,This book is useless. There are better books available.,I have read better books regarding the probabilities pertinent to poker. I was searching for these better books when I came across this weak book. This terrible book has no merit. It is not entertaining. It is not useful for making decisions in the game of poker. The author merely wants to have a book on the market. I advise you to look elsewhere for a book about the probabilities pertinent to winning at poker.
2,A bit misleading,This book is basically concerned with limit poker and is not the best book for people looking to buff up their no-limit strategy. I think there are many better books out there for learning no-limit strategy as well as no-limit odds.
1,Too Complex for the average person,Too many exotic formulas. The advice is a rehash or everything you have already read if you have previously purchased poker books.
3,haven t read it.......laughing at review of midwest,Midwest book review guy........do you give anything but five stars? do u get paid to write reviews?J Gelling ...your review was honest and i wont buy book... thanks
1,Misleading title: this book only applies to limit,"The title of this book, ""Weighing the Odds in Hold'em Poker"", is highly misleading.The book only pertains to limit Hold'Em. Usually, the phrase ""hold'em"" only means no-limit, or perhaps both limit and no limit. The word ""hold'em"" in a book title does not mean ""only limit hold'em"".There is no indication, at the time of this writing, in the editors' description on Amazon that this book only pertains to limit hold'em."
5,6 stars,"All is explained in Inside Adobe Photoshop 5.5 Why you use a tool or operation (brush, rubbber stamp, editing layer...) opposed to another, or, what something is, are answered clearly. You know you are reading a book written by experienced, seasoned, graphic designers with a thourough knowledge of Photoshop. I am at page 300 and look forward to the next 500 pages. Adobe photoshop is a complex, (some parts complicated) extensive program. Inside Adobe Photoshop 5.5 teaches you how to use it. This is what a good book should do... and it does! If you only want one book, buy this. If you would like to have a few books,(it never hurts) make this one of them."
2,Hard to follow,"I bought this book because many others have given it a good rating. But once I started using it, I just kept putting off doing the exercises. I feel that the exercises are hard to follow and that hampers my enthusiasm to do them. He does not explain WHY you are doing something. For example, he'll say hold Shift+Alt and move selection. I don't know why I'm holding down Shift+Alt until later, and even then he doesn't explain things clearly. I have had other software teaching books that are so much better written than this one is; for example the Lynda Weinman, Hands On Training series. Also, who wants to wade through tons of information to get to the point? I want to know what something does and how to do it. Then I take that information and apply it to my own projects. I am so dissapointed with my purchase of this (expensive) book."
3,"Superb meal, but missing many dishes","It must be said that this is a very good tutorial. It's written in an easy to follow format, but beware! many of the tools necessary to complete the exercises have been disabled in the CD-ROM version that comes with it. Unless you already own your own, FULL WORKING Photoshop program (version 5 will do), you'll experience MANY frustrating, fruitless DAYS attempting to complete the tasks. One of the authors, Mr. Gary Kubicek, confirmed this for me. I feel somewhat cheated, like taking a car out for a test drive, and finding out on the road that many of the controls have been disabled. Sorry, you have to shell out big time if you really want to drive the full working model.A fair tutorial, but a most disapointing experience."
3,"Not bad, now that it is assembled.","The assembly instructions for this are just awful. It's not a difficult assembly, but it was annoying. This feels like it could be a little more sturdy, but it will get the job done. The most difficult part was putting the handle on the top. I didn't push the pins through as far as I should have, and the handle kept slipping out.If you are planning on using the top entry, be forwarned that it is a bit difficult to close. You have to squeeze the crate a bit. Which is easier said than done if the animal is pushing up on the lid.I bought this because I have a cat who was rescued from a Cat Collector's home. He lived the first year of his life wedged in a crate with another cat. Obviously he's not a fan of being put back in a crate to go to the vet. This worked well for him, it was easy to put him in through the roof & he seemed pleased that he wasn't quite so closed in."
5,Best Crate I've had yet.,"I own 5 cats and am currently fostering 5 kittens. I'm always traveling to the Vet's office and I have owned many different carriers.This is the best carrier I've had so far. The convenience of the top opening is very helpful when dealing with a very sick or reluctant cat. (A brand new carrier is very stiff at first and takes a little more effort to open/close the top.) The vets have complimented on it also. In some cases, its easy for them to examine an animal from the top without struggling to take it out. It is well made and quite frankly, NOT difficult to assemble at all. I am VERY happy with this carrier and plan to purchase another one."
5,Well Made Carrier,This carrier is well made and offers two ways to access the interior compartment. The entire unit comes apart with quick release latches on the sides and end and two locking pins on either side of the front door. The door has a solid latch. I like the open grate on top so you can see the animal inside. Good size for a cat. Unit is dark green and cream.
4,Top loading not so good.,"I was a little disappointed in the top loading feature. There is not push lock on top like there is on the front. You basically pull the grill until it clicks which could be a problem if the cat is not too happy with being put in there. Otherwise, it is basically a good roomy carrier. The instructions could have been a little better."
3,"OK, but hard to assemble!","Once assembled, this is really just OK and not a good bargain. We had a very difficult time assembling. It didn't help that none of the instructions were in English either. Also, even after assembly, the top door is difficult to open and close. It's practically un-useable, which is a bummer. We picked this crate b/c we wanted 2 doors, which is tough to find. We don't like 1 door carriers. This was the best we could find in a 2 door model, but definitely not great. Buy this if you want 2 doors and can't find anything better. Otherwise, keep shopping."
3,Handle comes off,Be careful with this carrier as the handle pops off constantly. I actually have to carry the crate up in my arms. The handle popped off the first time and the carrier with my cat in it went tumbling. Luckily she was okay but you can't trust the handle.Niki
5,Great purchase and very child safe,"Like most parents, I'm particular about the quality and finishing of toys. I rate this highly compared to other toys trying to achieve the same purpose."
5,2 in 1!,"This toy is really two in one. Not only do you get the great blocks to build and learn with, but also the classic wooden wagon. My child loves to put other toys in it and pull them along with the sturdy blocks. This toy has been hours of entertainment."
5,"Classic, quality toy","We bought these blocks for our 10 month old daughter's first Christmas. I knew we wanted to get her alphabet blocks, and I was drawn to them after reading all the positive feedback here. Then I saw they were made in the USA, and I was sold. I'm so glad I spent a little more to get the version with the wagon, as it neatly stores all the blocks. When we first opened the box, the smell of the fresh wood instantly confirmed the GREAT quality of the blocks. The blocks are a great size and painted beautifully. We are having so much fun building towers and knocking them down! She loves dumping them out of the wagon and putting them into a bucket, too. When she's older, I'm sure we'll have fun naming the animals, spelling words, and even doing math with the numbers! We couldn't be happier... and we highly recommend!"
3,Has Some Good Moments,"After loving their previous two albums, I was a little let down when I purchased this album a few years ago. It's not that it's a bad album, I just didn't think it matched the varied complexity of their previous stuff. Their backing vocals are still great on here. Though I've never listened to this album that much, it still is worth a listen. ""Not Just for the Dead,"" and ""Dream In My Life,"" stand out from the rest of the disc."
4,Great King's X Songs from Top to Bottom,"King's X's fourth brilliant album in a row. Not nearly as ambitious as its predecessor Faith Hope Love, this one's a good deal more approachable and I'd recommend it to anyone new to the band as a place to start. It's got everything that makes King's X great: unbelievably great singing (you could call the harmonies ""Beatle-esque"" but only if the Beatles were a gospel choir), airtight heavy rock riffing, compelling, smart lyrics and top-drawer songwriting. This album, stocked with gems from top to bottom, includes the aching ""Big Picture,"" an irresistible romp called ""Lost In Germany"" and the absolutely indispensable ""Black Flag."" It's hard to believe this music was made by mere mortals."
5,THE HEIGHT OF THE BAND'S CAREER!,"King's X has had many great albums, but this one is the greatest. It has everything -hard guitar riffs, steady rhythm, meaningful lyrics, and melody that just makes you want to sing along with the CD! You can't go wrong here!"
5,Now I love it,"It is hard to dislike a King's X CD. But, shockingly I did not care for this when it first came out. Now, it has grown on me and it has become quite a favorite from the hard rocking opener, the cool Prisoner, the progressive Chariot Song, the awesome ""Not just for the dead"" and the haunting ""Silent Wind"". Great CD - my favorite of their first four. And it's odd because I liked the others so much back then but only recently realized what a gem this was. Perhaps the most underrated American rock band."
5,"Great Melody, Great Vocals and Awesome Guitar!","This is the best of the Kings X albums. FHL was great as well, but it had a few weak spots. Every song on this CD is worth listening to. After this CD the band sort of got angry about not recieving more commercial attention. I agree with the reviewer, there is absolutely no reason a band as talented and productive as this band should not have any hit records."
3,"Good, not great","I've listened to this set, and in comparison to the others I own or have access to (Klemperer, Furtwangler, Monteux, Maag, Zinman) it holds its own, but barely. There is nothing wrong with these performances: all the notes are in the right places, the phrasing and dynamics are judicious, the orchestra is good, the recording is resonant but clear. These are middle-of-the-road performances, and while a couple, like the 7th, have some new insights (it is one of the most dance-like versions I've ever heard), they are just missing the last bit of intensity and involvement which makes the difference between a good performance and a great one.While this set would make a good place to start, I'd strongly recommend getting other performances of individual symphonies for their greater emotional value. Or, if you must get a complete set, you could try Maag's on the Arts label instead: despite the shortcomings of his chamber orchestra, those performances take that step toward transcendence."
1,Yet another compilation,"I am a huge Tom fan. I go to his concerts and buy all of his CDs. I must say that I have been disappointed by this CD because it's entirely made of old recordings. There's a new photo on the cover, but that's all that is new here. So if you've bought your share of Tom CDs over the years, you want to check out the track info before you guy this one.Now, Tom has been on tour and I STRONGLY recommend that you go see him next year when he comes through your city.The other thing really annoying is that on the CD where you'd expect information about the music or the recording co., you instead get a large warning label from the FBI on pirating."
3,If you like this sorta thing,"Here Mr. Hampson is in his element. Unlike his less than viable attempts at Opera, Mr. Hampson is a thorough and intelligent singer of songs. His affectations, so fully inappropriate in bigger operatic literature, work well with the intimate nature of these sweet and personal songs. If you are Hampson fan, this album will thrill you."
2,Disappointing Duplication,"I have not even heard the album, and I will not. Although I revere Mr. H. in just about everything he does, especially in song and Lieder, I am very disappointed that so many of these songs appear on other cds of which I already have about 19 of him. I think he and the producers should have chosen totally NEW material for this instead of drawing on his past achievements. I have no reservations about his performances, for I have seen him at the Met in opera and at Carnegie Hall in Mahler. I value them and all of his past cd productions."
1,how precious!,"Thomas Hampson swoons and croons to monotonous effect throughout this tired collection; again displaying his ego and faux scholarship in ample measure. Oi-vay, what a disaster! And what is with the blue contact lenses in the Jacket phot? Hampson's eyes are brown. What an unbelievably vain Diva!"
1,Bogus!,"Completely bogus. None (zero) of the eggs hatched. I tried to contact vendor by phone and email, but the phone is not staffed and the email was not answered. Complete waste of money unless you want the little plastic castle for an aquarium ornament. This is the worst ""educational"" toy I have ever purchased. Instead of ""prehistoric sea monsters"", you get a bunch of modern-day wood dust floating on water."
1,Still haven't received this!,Interesting that I received an email to review the product but haven't received the product yet! It was supposed to be a birthday present for my son - so much for that idea. Very disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money.,"They never hatched. Waste of money! The kids cried when they had to flush the unhatched ""sea monsters"" down the toilet. I ranked the toy one star because there is no option for zero."
1,This should be taken off the market!,"I saw this product at Hobby Lobby, and since I love Sea-Monkeys I thought I'd give this a shot! It was $15, and the illustration on the box looked totally cool if this is what would be swimming around in the tank. Well, After 2 weeks...nothing! I made sure the water was the right temperature, the tank got indirect sunlight, etc. The most I got was TWO Sea-Monkeys, which I put in with my others! I then read the reviews about this product on the Internet, and couldn't believe all the negative words and how upset people were that it didn't work for them either! Why is this still on store shelves after so many people have complained?? I wouldn't even pay $5 for it which I've seen some markets sell it for! I've gotten the $5 Sea-Monkey kit at Walmart, and I've had nearly 6 large ones living for about 2 months now! To hell with Triops. I'm going to get more Sea-Monkeys! Don't buy this if you haven't already!!!! GET SEA-MONKEYS INSTEAD!!"
2,Cannibals!!!,"I have 2 week old triops. I have 2 triops now and had!! 2 fairy shrimp. I saw 4 creatures in the tank when they first hatched. I could of had 2 triops and 2 fairy shrimp now but the triops ate the fairy shrimp and that's why they are Cannibals!!! I kept them well, always with food pellets in the tank. I noticed later as they got bigger that there was one that looked odd not like a triop, it kinda looked like a shrimp so I looked it up on the internet and it was indeed a shrimp, a fairy shrimp so that night I named them. Yesterday I only had 3 creatures so I named the big triop Tubbie and the other Trixie and the fairy shrimp Poppi. Poppi was my favorite. In the morning Poppi was gone, the two big triops ate him alive! So I don`t recomend it to any animal lovers like me. By the way triops have three eyes, two in front and one on top, just to let you know."
3,Smithsonian Sea Monsters (Triops),"The directions on the box are too vague. There is no information on water temperature or how much light they need. Our first batch of eggs did nothing. After doing research on the web & following tips, we tried to hatch a second batch. We only got (2) - we expected (6). There should be more specific directions and you may get a bad batch of eggs. I can't find information on how to communicate with the company. I guess to try a 3rd time we will have to purchase another batch of eggs. The cost of the replacement eggs plus S&H is almost the same price we paid for the kit."
1,Waste of money!!!!,They do not grow. Waste of money! Crummy little tank. Nice showy outside box with no substance whatsoever.
1,NSI Prehistoric Sea Monsters,"Terrible. My son is soooo disappointed. As another reviewer mentioned, the instructions are rather vague. And I don't think the problem is me considering I have a Master's degree. No info about water temp, time in sunlight, elevation, etc., etc. We haven't had any eggs hatch and we are on the 2nd batch. We have placed them in the window sill as instructed and also near (but not directly under) a fluorescent light. Nothing. I've tried contacting the company with no response. What a rip-off. And such a shame to prey on children's curiosity to make a quick buck. Disgusting."
2,Disappointed,"I had expected this to be a good book, but it turned out to be some re-run from the other books about the golden age Hollywood, and the book was printed on bad quality paper. Also, who ever designed the book, and book cover, needs to do some improving. It looked unorganized, and uncreative. There's a little of everything, in this book. Too little of everything."
3,i dont know,"hate dept is an innovative technopop band which is something i have never said for any other band out there so i like alot of the album my favorites being WAIT, COMING DOWN, FIEND, AND FIREFLIES but alot of the songs are missing an element that u gotta have to be big on the radio possibly a big attention grabbing song much like a lot of newer bands have such as tantric. this song will get u buying and get the publics side so well shall see on their new release due soon"
2,Simple and Boring,"Hate Dept. isn't exactly a very innovative band. The lyrics aren't very deep or meaningful. Usually they are ambiguous and don't make much sense at all. The music isn't quite industrial, but it's not normal ""hard rock"" either. I suppose if you like horrible bands like Korn you should give this a listen.After all of this griping, however, there is one gem on the album. Well, sort of. The song Release It is pretty good as it has a fast tempo, though the lyrics, again, are simple and ambiguous and without much meaning. Unfortunately, the version on the album is a bit lacking, but their Release It EP contains a version (the Empirion Mix) that anyone who likes fast-paced Cubanate-style industrial should enjoy."
1,absolutely horrible,"this is the most horribly written album I ever heard. It's actually embarresing to listen too. Sure the music itself is good, nothing great, but don't expect to be itellectually stimulated by the lyrics. When I was 10 I saw the first Ninja Turtles movie, I loved it. I just watched it for the second time, a couple of days ago, I can't believed I actually liked that movie. I'd rather get attached by 700 pigmy elephants, than watch it again, I think it actually made me dumber. This was the same feeling I got listening to this Hate Dept album. They use the word ""cool"" way too much, it's like reliving the 80's. Listen to KMFDM or anything by Raymond Watts, thats industrial music."
5,"Dance/industrial/EBM, from one of the finest in the genre","This album effectively expresses the emotional twists and turns of resentment and frustration with the world and the people in it. Hate Department may not be the appropriate name for the group. No HATE seems to be expressed, more like anger and frustration, chanelled more appropriately and poetically. To steal a line from Skinny Puppy: ""With your eyes open, you know soft-spoken changes nothing."" This album is far from soft-spoken, but not ""preachy."" I find myself in political and emotional agreement with many of the lyrics.Do you like to dance to Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Forma Tadre, or old Nine Inch Nails? This is excellent dance music as well. I can't figure out why this has not been all the rage on the dance floors everywhere, though I do hear it in the harder clubs.Hate Department is not out of place in ballad land with ""Wait"" or ""Leaving"" either. Surprisingly, some deep rich vocals are blended in."
3,So so album,There are only 2 good songs on this album. Hit back and seedling. The rest of the songs are very mellow.
3,CD OF THE YEAR!,"I think that this cd express's anger,love,life. Hate's live show's are one of a kind. A very energetic show that bring's the audience into it. Steven Siebold is a caring good hearted very intellegent musician. hate deserves to be one of the top bands out there today."
1,Way over priced,"Hi, I just bought the same case in black instead of pink at ebay for $5.95 and free shipping."
4,pioneer cd player,"this cd player is overall a good cd player, i am a fan of pioneer and apline. It looks very confusing to use at first, but is really easy to use after about 15min of getting used to it. the only downfalls of this unit is that you cannot continously scroll through i pod songs, its annoying to scroll through artists from a -z. also it feels a little chaper like something is going to break when you remove and replace the face. otherwise i think this radio is great for the money"
3,POOR DESIGN,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM DUE TO BRAND NAME WITHOUT REALIZING THE DISPLAY IS NOT WELL DESINGED ITS NOT AN EASY TO USE ITEM THE DISPLAY FLASHES FROM BRIGHT TO DARK ALL THE TIME CREATING A HUGE DISTRACTION EVEN DURING THE DAY TIME THAT CAN NOT BE SHUT OFF ALL IN ALL A GREAT SOUNDING PEACE OF EQUIPMENT BUT NOT ONE I WOULD BUY AGAIN DUE TO THE DISPLAY JUMPING
1,Don't waste your money,"The Velmas on their ""Station"" cd rip off every late 80's early 90's guitar band. There is nothing wrong with showing your influences in your music but a blatent rip off sucks. You can go through each track and tag each one... this one is their Pearl Jam song, this one is their Candlebox song, this one is their Third Eye Blind song, the 311 song......Bleh. I'm sure they do fine locally, but as far as a national act goes... pretty piss poor. There is much better music in this world.... seek it out."
4,Out of This World,"I heard the opening track of this CD () on the radio and immediately fell in love with it. As with so much of medieval music, this is a ""realization"" as much as a performance, and Ensemble Organum has created a version of these pieces that differs from all others I have encountered. The unusual sonorities and strongly rhythmic performance of the Hymnus peregrinorum (Pilgrim's Hymn) had me stumped on first hearing. Musically, my ears were saying ""Byzantine"" but the text was Latin. This track alone is worth the price of admission."
2,Misleading,"The earrings are very attractive but there are a few gray areas regarding what the earrings are composed of.The editorial review states that they are made of 14k and are lightweight. For the size of the earrings, if they were solid gold, they would be heavier so they must be plated, and this is never mentioned. What is the base metal? Also the product spec's state that they are made of 18k gold.So which is it, 18k of 14k, are they solid or plated? $95.00 isn't expensive or cheap but I guess I expected a little more than I should have, I suppose."
4,NBA Street ball!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is way better than the original!Much more features for create player. New moves.Better graphics. New playas. U can do NBa challenge or Be a legend to unlock all the playas. Do pick up game 4 fun 1 or 2 players. The only drawback is u cant put 2 memory cards in wit diff info and play wit them.Oh well this game still rocks hard!P.S. Its much easyer than other sports games, ull love it!(-:"
4,darius likes this,This game arrived in a timely manner. This game arrived in great new-like condition. The game was great fun to play and the music is good also. I will not hesitate to order again.
4,Best B-Ball game yet,"This goes out to all true basketball fans. This game is the top dog of basketball games i have played yet. Its lots of fun. Lots of different moves. Tons of different players and lots of reasons to keep playing, that is if you do wannna win new courts, nba legends, and street ball legends. GET THE GAME MAN."
5,You call this a game?,"This was the suckiest game ever. It sucked. The commentary sucked, the graphics were horrible, and the basketball barely bounced. This isn't basketball. You don't know what basketball is. What were u people thinking when you made this game?? I'm at a loss for word at the suckinness. Anyway don't buy the game. It'll be a $40 rip off. Especially for christmas."
1,"1 star, but read it first to see why","Well It was my birthday on the 28th of may and Im going to buy NBA STREET v.II I gave it a 1 star because I haven't played the game, when I play it I'll post another review with my final choice. Im a very good video player and very picky and when I dont like a game I mean it. LETS SEE HOW IT GOES"
5,Some thoughts occurred during reading,"It is the first time for me to read this type of book, naturally I have several thoughts during the reading.(i) When reading the first chapter, I feel familiar with the content because some religious Chinese told me something similar. But it seems to me that their understanding on this topic is only limited to the first chapter because I am never told other things included in other chapters.(ii) Sometimes, I feel that I am reading the detailed notations on certain phrases taken from Bible with author's understanding.(iii) Sometimes, I feel happy and noble when reading this book, but thereafter I feel the world still ugly as it was before reading.(iv) I admit that I cannot write anything like this book, because the author can argue so much based on so few facts. Thus, I sometimes feel the book somewhat empty.(v) Sometimes I hope to read more on this type of books in future."
4,COOL RELEASE FOR DIEHARDS,"This is a pretty decent release of re-recorded Ratt material by Pearcy. I enjoyed hearing Lynch and Guns play most of the leads as well. As for the dvd disc that is included, it is nothing special. It was just a bunch of fooling around in the studio and a really bad video which is why I gave this release a four instead of a five which I think is rather generous. All in all, if you liked Ratt, you should have this cd."
3,"OK, but not great","Songs are fine, suble changes that I didn't like, but you are not getting the original recordings. These are new interpretations of the old songs."
3,Not a great buy,"The backpack is too heavy. Remember that the 5 pounds it weighs is as much as a laptop. If I would have realized the difference that weight would have made, I would have purchased an Ogio or something else with less weight. On the flip side, the extra weight does bring added protection for a laptop. I personally don't see the benefit."
3,A good choice,"This is a good, sturdy backpack for a good price; lots of pockets, well padded, etc. Good for transporting your laptop through the airport, and I especially like the way it is constructed to stand up when set down on a flat surface. Drawbacks: (1) it is a little oversized to fit underneath an airplane seat; it will go, but it takes some forcing. (2) No cell phone pouch on the shoulder strap. My last backback had one on the right shoulder strap, and I miss that convenience.I also would have liked a clip on the outside of the backpack, and some pen/pencil sleeves, but those are quibbles. Not perfect, but a good backpack for the price."
5,One Great Backpack,"I just love this backpack, lots of pockets, comfortable to wear for hours, I think this is a great buy !!!"
4,love it!,I love this backpack! Very sturdy and I use it daily for class. They shipped on time and it looks just like the picture!
4,Quite happy with it.,"I bought this bag for my 14"" laptop and books. There is a lot of space, the laptop is well protected and it is easy on the back. It looks very nice too! I especially liked the inner compartments where I can safely stash my purse and also the MP3 player compartment. I also keep my voice recorder and flash drives in there since it is easy accessible.I liked it very much...The only problem I've had so far is, with my 5'2"" 120lb frame I look like a pack mule when I have my bag stuffed. People do tend to give weird looks and I often hear comments like ""what do you have in there?!!"" and ""Arent we loaded up today!!""If you ca handle that or if you are bigger than me...I think it'll be a good buy."
3,too big and bulky,"I just wanted a bag to hold my laptop securely and have some space to store some books for school. This bag definitely has ample room but even with nothing in it it's heavy and bulky. With my laptop and just a few notebooks and folders it weighs probably around 30-40 pounds. When full, it probably wouldn't even fit under seats on an airplane. For a small girl like me it's unwieldy and I've not really used it since I've gotten it, which defeats the purpose. So just beware when purchasing, it's better suited for someone of a larger frame who doesn't mind the bulk and weight."
5,Love the back pack,It's a great back back. It has so many spaces...it's roomy and comfortable to wear on your back..it's a good back pack to have if you have back problems because it gives you the back support you need and it balances the weight out evenly.
3,Great for a while,"I bought this backpack about a year and a half ago. For the first year or so I was very satisfied. As others have said, it is huge. It can hold more than you can lift and will not tear or fall apart. I took on dozens of business trips all over the world, and was quite pleased with it. The problem I started having was the huge main zipper, eventually it will start separating. As the zipper goes to the bottom of the bag, it can dump the contents of your bag's main compartment on the ground. I had a couple of close calls before I decided to replace it. I of course can't duplicate it at will, so I never sent it in for service. I replaced it with another Swiss Gear bag where the zipper only goes 3/4 of the way down the bag. While it isn't nearly as roomy as this bag it does have less stress on the zipper and hasn't experienced the same problem. One thing to be careful of when packing, it can expand so much you may not fit it under a plane seat."
5,MAXXUM from SwissGear by Wenger Computer Backpack Red,This was the best backpack that I was able to find. It had all the necessary things and best of all it could also hold your laptop. Even one of my colleges liked it so much that they also purchased one. Also the quality is very good.
2,Not so impressed,"I loved this bag when I first got it, but as time wore on so did my bag. I have only had it a little over a year and I have already started to have the seams come undone on the straps"
2,Not a water proof backpack,"Not a perfect backpack It's roomy and heavy. This backpack is not a water proof bag, water leaks into bag if you are out on a rainy day. One of my zipper got bad after 6 months of use."
4,Good backpack..high on price,"Good backpacks, but high on price and no return policy. One week later and price dropped $40, and could have saved $80. Be sure to watch out for these kind of buyers.MAXXUM from SwissGear by Wenger Computer Backpack Red"
4,"Best for 14 inches, Good for 15 inches","My Dell Inspiron 6000 15"" laptop just fits into the bag. Initially had problems in closing the zip,but now I am used to it. No other complaints other than that. Overall I am satisfied with it."
5,Great computer & travel backpack!,"This is a quality backpack, with lots of great compartments and is comfortable as well. As a couple of other reviewers mentioned the two pouches I am missing are one for a cellphone (so you don't have to dig to the bottom) and pen & pencil slots.I didn't have any problem fitting mine under the seat of the airplane. Besides our 15.5 laptop, my husband and I put lots of stuff inside ours book, magazine, maps, translator, hardcase of 24 CD's, one DVD to watch (didn't have to pay for a Digiplayer!), small digital camera, portable HD, cell phone and adapter and chargers for everything, some snacks, water bottle on the side pocket and our passports which we kept in a passholder and attached to the open pocket for ease of use in the airport procedures, departing and arriving through immigration and customs. There was still room left! My friend who travelled with us loved it too and wants to buy one now. I'd definitely recommend to others. It's a great value!"
3,HUGE,"this backpack is HUGE, so do not purchase if you have a small or medium frame. i would say that it's well made, except one of the plastic piece broke during the 1st week of use. it's a good bag, but not worth the raving reviews or the price. it is very spacious with a lot of little pockets for different things, useful if you have a lot of things to carry."
5,One sturdy carry-all!,"My son just entered high school. He has developmental disabilities andneeded a high quality backpack to keep him organized and balanced. As hewent through two Samsonite backpacks last year, which literally fell apart,I was very concerned. I spotted this backpack in a local store and wasimmediately impressed with it's quality. I searched online and found thatAmazon.com had the best offer. Now, three weeks into school, my son isorganized and says the backpack is balanced and comfortable to wear. We'llsee how it goes through the school year. I predict good use and no problems!"
2,DIDN'T FIT ! BEWARE,"Simply stated; my 15.4 Toshiba laptop didn't fit in this bag.I tried expanding every compartment/buckle - it didn't fit.A waste of time, effort & money.Go to a store with your laptop 1st, try it.Do search on google 1st, I should have."
3,"No way it will hold 15.4""","Please see my review for the Swiss Army Synergy black bag, it was meant for this backpack. NO WAY WILL THIS FIT AT 15.4"" NOTEBOOK WITH OUT MODIFICATION...... THIS IS A FALSE ADVERTISEMENT..... 15"" OF LESS ONLY."
2,"For the love of God, keep your receipt!",SwissGear will not honor their life time warranty if you don't keep the receipt or proof of purchase. Mine is falling apart. The stitching on the shoulder straps are coming lose. Buyer beware.
5,The best laptop backpack I've ever owned,"SwissGear has my business forever after purchasing this laptop backpack. I've been using it for 5-years now, and it still looks like new! No rips, tears, or signs of stress... not even discoloration from the sun!The backpack was purchased for travel (by car and motorcycle) to and from work primarily, but it has been my constant companion for many business trips as my carry-on luggage. The two main pockets have plenty of room for folios, folders, notebooks, books, extra clothes, etc., as well as a very secure design for the laptop (closer to the straps than other manufactures, which keeps the weight and the fragile laptop closer to your back instead of in the front). The side pockets and front pocket are perfect for accessories, and the open pocket is great for my lunch, keys, or other things I need quick access to.If you travel... you need this backpack!"
5,Favorite item,"It is a little bit larger than i cared for once I got it in the mail, but this is my new favorite item. I care a laptop too and from work everyday. I work at television studios in california so the walk from the parking structure to my office can be a very long walk. I used to have a briefcase looking laptop holder that always hurt my shoulders.This is RED (my fave) and it is padded on the straps but also on the part of the bookbag that is against your back.In fact, with the new strict laws for flying, I take out all my work stuff and pack this bad boy up for my trips on a plane. It holds and awful lot, but I don't feel like I am carrying too much at all. Very durable. I love it."
5,Clannad Anam,"This is probably my favorite of Clannad's works. The variety of songs is enjoyable, and it's wonderful to play just for some nice background music."
2,"Quite boring, in my opinion","This is the first (and only) Clannad album I bought. I was and still am a big Enya fan, so I decided to try her sister's band. I was disappointed by this album. Lots of lousy muzak stuff, with lush production and not much else that is memorable. ""Poison Glen"" is nice, though.I guess I bought the wrong Clannad album, judging from the other reviews here. Maybe some of the earlier stuff would be more to my liking."
2,A Bad Introduction to Clannad,"This is the first Clannad Album I've heard, and I so far I'm not impressed. None of the songs got my attention, except two that grated on my nerves."
4,Iris Folding for Christmas,"Iris folding is a beautiful technique. I was pleased to see that Amazon.com had some books about it. This book ""Iris Folding for Christmas is great-not only does it have clear instructions, but it has several holiday templates, which are very important in iris folding.Judith Williams"
2,"Good book, bad editing","This book has some great stories that are very interesting and told extremely well. Unfortunately, there are spelling errors on about every other page. It's as though the book was never edited :("
5,this truely is a presant for eveyone,"busted's debut album was mega and it sort of rocked but now the trio have a second album 'a presant for everyone' the title sums up just what the album offers, this album truley rocks much, much harder than the first. great new mateerial has been presented to the world with this album with tracks of the funny meaning for example: loner in love, which brings out the funny side of writing music and the great: nerdey, which is encourging todays most unpopular to make a stand and show the world that they are not just a nerd.once again Charlie, Matt and James have showed us that they are still going strong and loving the fact that they are inspiring today's youth.good work boys!"
5,still obtaining,Can a former reviewer give a source for the stocking of this item since presently it seems so difficult to track the CD product. Thanks.
5,Roots of Rock,"Listen to this to unearth the roots of luminaries like Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones! Beautifully remastered, this is indeed the soma juice of planet rock."
3,"Close, but no cigar...","The overall presentation is good and there is a great deal of useful vocabulary in here. My one beef is that the entire workbook is in German, with absolutely NO translation, explanation or introduction and the video cassette has absolutely no details on the plain white cover.Without a dictionary, you cannot possibly make any real use of this package, even though the quality of the mime is good enough to convey the basic drift of each lesson. As for ""Peter"", any guys left questioning their sexuality should note that ""he"" is played by Eve-Marie Forcier.There DEFINITELY should have been an English translation and some kind of rudimentary introduction in English."
5,A first-rate survey.,"An execellent concise overview of the history of rhetoric. The bibliography alone is worth the price of admission. Vickers covers the theory and practice of rhetoric in English poetry, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. He provides you with enough information about sources and materials to develop a first-hand understanding of related texts and commentary."
2,Average book,Not that many good pictures considering the price. There are other tulip books with better pictures of harder-to-find tulips. The book was small and not that interesting.
4,A GREAT LITTLE DISC,"This is a decent disc of great pop music tinged with sadness. Somewhat adolescent yet very imaginatively vivid and intelligent lyrics, and complex tunes? Great uptempo numbers, and also great melancholy pop. The guy sounds alot like Elvis Costello on many of the songs. Not for the faint of heart--don't listen if you're just getting over a girl!"
3,Kind of a Disappointment,"Resnick starts out strong and sets up an interesting, unique world populated by compelling characters -- loved the den of the water wizard -- but it all falls apart in the second half of the book. It's hard for me to discuss exactly what I disliked without giving away a ton of spoiler information, but in general, I found the book anticlimactic. Events that seem key at the time appear to have absolutely no repercussions, and I could stay up all night talking about the problems I have with where Josarian is at the end of the book. Also, the ""hot"" love scenes betray Resnick's roots as a romance novelist just a little too much. Perhaps some of the loose ends I had such problems with will be tied up in the sequel -- but I got the feeling that with this one, Resnick meticulously created a fascinating world, only to allow that world to spin out of her control. Three stars."
5,Fantastic,"Usually when I see a book that a lot of people like, I hestitate to buy it- on the reason that most best sellers are predictable stuff concocted to keep your average brainless reader interested.This one was fantastic. I can say that with my hand on my heart, swearing to god. The characters were intersting, and well-rounded. They act like real people. These aren't some nice bodies concocted to serve a goal that everyone believes in though they don't know why. They all have their own reasons for everything.This book's romance isn't the soggy stuff of the Last Dragon Lord. People don't love each other with all their hearts because they're of the same blood. They don't exactly love with all their hearts, anyway. Everything about this book is realistic.This isn't a light read,but after you read it you'll be satisfied. The theme is cliched, but the plot is not. Suspense will grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat."
1,bad charger,"The picture shown is for the older charger, the one that charges in about 5 hours. What they will ship you is the charger that takes almost 10 hours to charge. Don't buy this one. Alas, this is the only charger left. You cannot buy the charger that is pictured. The picture is not correct of what you will receive."
3,You may not get what you expected!,"First, and probably most importantly, this device has a EUROPEAN style plug, not a U.S. style plug. That's not what you would expect from the description which states: ""Friendly Robotics Fast External Charger extra U.S. chargers."" I had to purchase an adapter from my local Radio Shack store to use this device in a standard U.S. wall plug.Second, if you previously had an external fast charger from Friendly Robotics, you will be disappointed by the charge time on this model. The previous model was an 8 amp charger which charged batteries in about 3-4 hours. This model claims to charge in 6 hours or 10 hours (both are shown in the product description for this item), and my personal experience is 10+ hours for a full charge.All that said, the unit works and the vendor shipped the item in a timely fashion. Read the product description carefully before you make your purchase!"
1,"Skip Over Daugharty's Novels: Boring, Boring, BORING","WHISTLE is flatly unreadable. My book club read Earl in the Yellow Shirt, and not a single member could finish it. As in Whistle, the dialogue was cliched, the characters were one dimensional, the plot shop-worn and predictable. It makes you wonder how bad books get published. I like to give authors a second chance (and I tried with Whistle) but it was dry as Georgia dust.We won't be reading any Daugharty books in the future and wish someone could have warned us.Southern fiction has had a tremendous revival; no one should have to be force fed any terrible books. There are too many excellent ones out there."
1,Worst artist ever!!! A shameful exibit of 80's Rock,This guy is the biggest poser. The only people that gave him good reviews were his family members or friends. This guy really sucks.
4,More Than A Pretty Face,"Rick Springfield is still looking for respect. Still thought of as a teen idol, although he had his biggest hit at the age of 31, most critic's are reluctant to give him his due. This CD adds 4 tracks to the Greatest Hits CD, and it holds up just fine. So, the heck with critic's. Just enjoy the hooks and sing-a-long."
1,Some Good... Some Slugs,"If you are looking for his hits... you would be better off getting his first two albums... this ""best of"" is about 1/2 ""best of"" and 1/2 filler"
2,Most are edited versons of songs. When is RCA gonna get it .,"I feel cheated when it comes to GREATEST HITS packages. The Songs were great back in the day. Some are edited down.. I would like to see RCA come out with full versons of his hit songs. I have already got a hits package with his songs from the 80s.I sure hope that I never play this again.. I hope that someone come out with a hits package with complete versions of songs. I have Jessie's Girl, and Bop Til you Drop... I hope that they will get it right and release a full verson CD of his hits or one CD of his 70s records... When is RCA going to give us what we want?"
3,I've Done Everything for You,"What a song! Must be Rick's marraige in a nutshell. Haven't we all done everything for you and you've done nothing for me!A great song, the theme song for the WHC. Worth the price for the CD."
1,"Where's ""Honeymoon in Beirut""?","If you're going to release an album called Rick Springfield's Greatest Hits, how do you omit his greatest hit?""Honeymoon in Beirut"" is by far the best song the guy did --It's like when people talk about the Police's Synchronicity album and they say ""Every Breath You Take"" is the best song --Hello? ""Tea in the Sahara"" is the song that exemplifies what that album was about.........anyway.........Rick had a lot of great songs, but to leave out his best one and put some of the clunkers that are on this album is inexcusable."
4,I love Rick Springfield,I love his hit songs. I just want to be counted as yet another person who loves this CD. He really is a great artist. I love to relive my teen years when I listen to this
5,Something New,"I am thirteen and my mom and dad listen to rick springfield. Me, being an offspring of 2 of the biggest rick fans, love this CD by far. This is an amazing CD, and you can always get the other ones cheap. If you are a fan of ricks this CD is totally for you ;)"
4,"""Better Love Somebody"".","Having started liking Rick Springfield's music through his beautiful classic track ""Love Somebody"", he continued to bring out classics from time to time like ""State Of The Heart"", ""Rock Of Life"" & ""Honeymoon In Beirut"". It's true Rick Springfield appealed mostly to young fans in his day with his ketchy pop sounds like ""Jessie's Girl"", ""I've Done Everything For You"", ""What Kind Of Fool Am I"" & ""I Get Excited"", but had also brought out adult contemporary pop / rock sounds that have become classic. I would have liked ""Honeymoon In Beirut"" to have been included in this compilation! This CD is a good overview of Rick Springfield's works on his 50th birthday in 1999!"
4,"Simple, Thoughtful Help","This is an excellent books to give to people who are thinking about getting married, who are newly married, or for people who have been married a while, this book can help re-focus your marriage. In simple terms, the book outlines potential obstacles in the first two years of marriage and gives you useful tools for building your relationship. Its a short book that doesn't waste space on psychoanalysis but in plain, understandable English, opens your eyes to some issues you might not readily see when in the haze of new love."
4,Testament Commercialized!!,"Testament has always been a great band just needing some direction. Thankfully, they are still trying. If I have to pick a favorite on this album ""The Sermon"" wins. This is not my favorite Testament album by far. Unfortunately, they toured with Slayer after this album and returned to their Legacy roots. Although some applauded, I feel they were finally evolving their own style of music through Souls of Black and Pratice What You Preach. I have to say this CD was a bit too weak but coming out with LOW afterwards really rattled my tree. Not a bad selection for any metal fan out there."
2,Early fan that is not a fan of this release,"I was a fan of Testament as soon as 'The Legacy' came out. BIG FAN. While they had already started to slow their thrash down on 'Practice What You Preach' at least it had good songs. I found this release to be too mainstream, slick and just plain boring. Chuck has no intensity or edge to his vocals. The only songs I can still listen to on here are 'Electric Crown' and 'Let Go Of My World'. The best thing I can say about this release is that it is better than the 1-star 'Souls of Black' cd they did. Ugh."
2,Ritual Review,"I bought this album because I love the song ""Electric Crown"". Additionally, I read a review stating that this was Testament's most melodic and non-thrash album of all their studio work. The statement is verifiable upon listening to it and Skolnick's lead work is searing on this one. However, the album lacks something and what that something is I'm not quite sure. Put it this way, I wouldn't replace it if I were to lose my current copy of the album."
2,Not that good,I bought this album on tape and I didn't like it that much. It's too slow and it just doesn't sound like Testament at all. The New Order is much better than this one. It's not worth buying on CD.
2,Huge Letdown,"I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release. Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience. This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst. Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up."
2,Tired and Weak,Perhaps the most boring Testament album for me. Everything sounds uninspired. As if they were not sure of their own directions musically. Any other album by them is fine.
2,News Flash...Testament deserts their Thrash-Metal roots....,"To tell you the truth about this CD,it's an analogy of Metallica's ""The Black Albumn"" in that their music really began to stink afterwards.This is where Testament went from an excellent underground thrash-metal to a mainstream hard-rock band.I found the music a drastic contrast to their earlier works...especially when you listen to their albumns such as ""The Legacy"" and this one and make the comparison.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that they simply became a sell-out to their true thrash-metal fans...like me.And what makes it worst...they went ahead and tried to go death-metal with their later works..."
3,Just o.k.,"""The Ritual"" is not my favorite Testament album (although ""Electric Crown"" is one of my favorite Testament songs). The album is o.k. There just isn't any fire on this one. The songs are reasonably well-done even if they are uninspired. Testament has several much better albums than this.Not recommended."
3,What happened???,"I had not been listening to testament for long, but this cd was such a let down from souls. What we see here is a cd devoid of any emotion and trapped in a time where the band felt neglected and unappreciated in its own scene. This is the one and only time Testament tried to apeal to the general masses. My first listen to a video, electric crown and I was like wow this is interesting between all the grundge coming out but when the face of testament was behind this music it felt so uninspiring compared to their usual work. Many fans claim that return to serinity was a great song, I call blasphamy...listen to the legacy and find where the heart and soul is. This is by far the most disappointting LP that testament has ever released. Go buy the gathering and feel where the band should be."
4,Faux painting made easy,I love to faux paint and usually use a rag. This product made it so much so much easier especially because of the large area. I gave it 4 out of 5 because 1 of the rollers fell apart.
2,Experienced painter,"I thought it would save time; but, most of the painting was easier to accomplish by hand ragging. The roller makes it too uniform which negates the reason for ragging in the first place."
2,hitch,"Receiver Hitch do not fit on car.I waited too long so now I have to cut one side,install and then weld it again."
3,Fast moving and fresh look at war,"This is a no nonsense account of the first weeks of OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM in March 2003. The authors are former Marines, and their affection for and sense of brotherhood with the young Marines they are writing about is evident on every page. But there's no hero worship. Plenty of mistakes are recorded. What sets this book apart from the celebratory or critical media accounts of the war is its down to earth style. No ten dollar words or literary fanciness, just straightforward and often humorous relating of this compelling story. A fascinating glimpse into what military service in a modern war is about."
4,Remembering Jenny,"I, too, was a student at Flagler College. I met the real Jenny our first day, freshman year. She was my next door neighbor. I got to know her, have maintained friendships with some of her friends, and have never forgotten her. This book made me long for St. Augustine, the Fort, the Bridge of Lions, St. George Street. Thank you for writing a book that made me honestly believe that I could hear the horse drawn carriages, smell the water, and see the town as it really is, magical. Thank you for writing a book that has touched me on so many different levels. If you are thinking of purchasing this novel, rest assured that you will be making one of the finest decisions of your life. Thank you for writing a book that tells more than just a story."
5,informative,"For those who are unfamiliar or ignorant with Jewish Oral Law a.k.a The Talmud ( as opposed to Jewish Written Law - basically the Bible),this book describes how it developed from Sinai onwards. It does not cover any laws specifically but gives a good grounding of its make up."
5,"Great Work, can't say anything more","Rabbi Parry has provided a great wprk for those interesting in learning Talmud. I have just started Gemara shiurim, and I have found this book in great complement to it. The facts are fascinating, and the Rabbi is top notch. A testament to that would be when I brought the book to Hancock Park for Shabbos and when I brought it to the shul, everyone who stopped by to see it when I put it down (not of my intent) read it and gave words of praise to Rabbi Parry. That speaks for itself."
2,Poorly written and edited,"This book is perfectly genial, but there are a lot of problems with it. The most minor is that it is full of typos and inconsistancies in spelling (such as writing Shabbos in one place and Shabbat in another -- with no explanation why).It's hard to tell who the intended audience for this book is. An educated person will not learn anything new from it and an uneducated person will often find the stories and explanations repetitive, inadequate, ambiguous, and sometimes plain bizarre (at one point the author quotes Erich von Daniken!).But the very worst problem is even though this is a guide to the Talmud and not contemporary Judaism, an uneducated person may not realize the disconnect between the two -- that something talked about in the Talmud is not necessarily what is practiced today -- and will thus get a distorted view of modern practices.This book is Talmud Lite and is only for someone who has a superficial interest in the topic."
1,A lot smaller than expected,"I got the size stated as HUGE. It was the next one after 5 foot diameter. It was regularly priced at 179.00, but marked down to 59.00. I thought, ""Wow"" I'll get the HUGE one since it's cheaper than the 5 foot diameter one and it is bigger."" Don't be fooled. It is a small bean bag chair. It is not HUGE like it says. It barely fits me comfortably and I am only 5'5. I wouldn't purchase this if I were you. You should see the mess it created in my house when I had to open it up to fluff up the fuf. The zipper even broke when I was zipping it back up. Thumbs down."
1,Misleading size - Huge?,"SO I finally pulled the trigger for this chair and went with the Huge size - Amazon thats complete BS - look at the product dimensions and you will see that Huge is actually Small. What the heck was that? Completely misleading - you even have the list price as $179 to make it look more expensive than the King - DO NOT FALL FOR THE ""HUGE"" - I purchased several and they will be comming back as soon as they arrive - then I will order the King's"
3,not a bad compilation,"It definitely has an Ibiza feel with moments of beach walking and ocean sunsets. There are a lot of good tracks on the cd but there is too much of a new age feel for me on it to give it more than three stars. If you like new age, this is for you. There are some good beats and laid back grooves among the track selections but they are too spaced out for my liking. I like seeing the new artists ive never heard of, a little diversity is a good thing. I recommend this cd, not highly, for those who like laid back chill music, good for late nights and chill afternoons."
2,Dont believe the Hype.,"for this type of setting, I can think of much better compilations. It's not FAB, but it's not the worst either."
3,Bremen back to Germany.,"I wondered why I never heard this story before. The Bremen was a huge ship (over 50,000 tons). In late August, 1939 the Bremen found herself in New York harbor with war clouds gathering in Europe. The Bremen left New York after many hurdles put up by the American administration and proceeded to cross the Atlantic and dock in North Russia. Three months later, this same ship left North Russia and came back to Nazi Germany. She narrowly escaped a British submarine on her way home.First off, I believe the story of this ship was rather inconsquential. It was a somewhat interesting story for those interested in World War II. However this liner never was important to the war effort and later sabotage prevented it from serving any other purpose in the war. It was of interest to show how Roosevelt was not neutral at even the beginning of the war and how the Soviets helped the Nazis at the start."
3,exactly as expected,"Previous reviews were helpful to me in purchasing this product. I got exactly what I expected, basic remote control functions in a ""wow"" of a package. Santa was a hero in our house on Christmas morning. My son is 6, loves all things robotic and remote controlled. The only negative is that my son has expectations that the robot is ""real"" and will do what he says. Reasonably durable for an inflatable product. It gets significant play whenever someone new comes over."
1,Not Worth it,"Bought this a year ago and threw it out after a few months. Remote didn't work. Gift recipient ended up using the this inflated toy as a punching bag. It then deflated after a few months, not surprisingly."
3,a prop,used this as a prop for church the kids loved it but i was able to but it new for $50 ... it has gone up .... alot since then ... would never ... NEVER have paid what it is going for now ....
3,"mega-mech,inflateable robot-","This air robot will probably arrive to you with some corrosion in battery compartments.,due to test batterys from factory left-in(mercury)be prepared to clean/replace springs etc.in that area..Mine didn't leak air from robot body-but read blogs that claim that.Won't roll over anything but flat linoleum,or wood floors.So forget it if carpeted home.I modified mine as motors get hot,& added rubber traction belts onto drive wheels-much better now.Still getting rare(discontinued item) & awe inspireing for kids!"
3,Amazing for the eye. Dumb with its quality,You only go by your luck with products like these. It's too good for the price. Really tall enough and doesn't take much effort to pump life. My 3 year old niece enjoyed it's size and operation. Its really fun when it moves around in the house like another person.But too bad mine was defective. It was leaking under its arm pits and would actually loose strength in an hour or two. I tried my best to fix but nothing really worked. Later on there were other cavities before it was declared dead. Was fun as long as it lasted but had a quick expiration date.
4,"Problem at the get go, but great toy when it was working!","When I opened this toy to get it set up for my son's birthday, I discovered a big problem. One of the batteries had corroded a spring that holds the battery in place, therefore the battery woudn't stay in place. Fotunately, someone knew to use folded up tin foil and cram it in the space, and luckily that worked. The toy worked fine with that quick-fix and it was a HUGE hit at the birthday party (5 and 6 year-olds)and even at show-n-tell for his school. This is the most entertaining toy we've had for a long time. It's tall and moves slowly, the voice is definately robot-material, it leans when the air gets a little low (an easy fix), but it will be a favorite for a very long time.If you want lots of laughs and entertainment, this is the perfect toy to get. It's been hilarious to watch children play with it and we've been caught manuvering him around a few times ourselves!"
5,What a bargain- and very fun for a little kid.,"Bought it for a friend's kid who is maybe 3 or so. He absolutely worships the thing- he even sleeps with it! It's held up so far (few weeks) and this little guy can be pretty tough on toys. It seems like it would be fragile being inflatable, but it's holding up fine. Very simple remote control to move it around and it says a few phrases. Probably wouldn't impress a lot older kid, but this little tyke thinks it's the coolest thing around!"
3,mercury batteries in this toy!,"Purchased this for my techy husband and father-in-law. They were shocked to find this ""toy"" to give directions that the batteries included were ""for demonstration only and should be replaced and disposed of"" but only inspection of battery label showed their very high mercury content. It is important to dispose of these batteries as the true hazardous material they are, but as it is mercury you will not actually ""need"" to for a long while, since they should be very long-lasting, despite their toxicity.Toy is fun, but consumers need to be responsible and question the advice to simply ""dispose"" of the demonstration battries. Please be responsible and take for hazardous waste disposal or recycling when used up."
1,big disappointment,"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas this year, thinking it was the size of a pillow...When I recieved it I was shocked to see how small it was and not as big as it was pictured. He loves Cars and Lightning McQueen, so he'll still like the toy, but I don't know how much fun he'll get from it!! I just can't help thinking it looks like a prize from a happy meal!!"
4,Cute toy,"This is a cute toy for a little one. Being a big fan of the movie, ""Cars"", my 2 1/2 year old loves it. It is very soft, and you just hit it and it talks. I am not sure how long it will last, but it's worth the money."
3,Loses Luster Quick,"While my son had fun with this for a couple days, it soon got to be annoying to hear it hit the floor, the wall, ect... Not to mention that the battery only lasted 4 days. Then we removed the box, and now it's great as a stuffed toy for him..."
4,Fun but not really worth the price,"I bought this toy as a Christmas present for my two and a half year old who loves ""Queen"" (what he calls Lighting McQueen). He thoroughly enjoyed throwing it up in the air and listening to the various exclamations as it hit the ground. Unfortunately, the ""Yack"" part wore out very quickly with only around thirty hits before it stopped. He does still enjoy playing with it and takes it to bed with him; however, truly not worth the price if you're purchasing it for the ""Smack and Yack"" features."
2,Fun while it lasts,"I fortunately got this from a very good seller, because I received one of these toys and it didn't work. He sent me a second one, which did and still does. My son has a LOT of fun with it. However, the biggest drawback to it is that there is no way to replace the battery, therefore, once the installed batteries run out, it's a silent toy. (Not always a bad thing for parents, but this one isn't annoying or loud, so I wish it had a way to replace the batteries.)"
3,"Good for small child, but....","This seems to be a well made toy, and it nice and soft for a small child, but to get it to talk you really have to whack it hard. My almost 2 year old grandson can't make it talk."
2,No Score!!!!!!!!!!!,What happened to the wonderful score from this film. It's a crime.....or is it a marketing opportunity for a second soundtrack album. The film may take a swipe at the Disney corporation but the marketing of it's product only mirrors Disney. Shame on you Dreamworks!
4,Good with minor setbacks,"The score to Shrek is FANTASTIC. The main theme (which appears in multiple songs on the disk) is also great. The main setback is song #3 (Leslie Carter- Like Wow). It is a Britney Spearsish type song that really sets the overall disk back a notch. If you have the money, buy this CD and skip track 3. Go straight to track 10 (Rufus Wainwright's Hallelujiah). It is absolutely phenomenal."
4,Very Nice...=),I think Disappointed rated the CD to harshly. Just because one song is bad doesn't mean the rest are. I think the CD has really upbeat and catchy songs.
4,"watch the movie, buy the soundtrack...","The movie, Shrek, came out last night. Several reviewers said that the soundtrack was not family oriented. I agree. The movie itself was not made to be a family movie if your family included children under the age of eleven. The movie itself was rated PG for mild language and some crude humor by the MPAA. I personally think it should have recieved a PG-13, but most of the jokes that relevent that were not totally explained and would be over most youngster's heads. For a soundtrack, I think that it is very well done. It was humorously implemented into the film and the choices were interesting. I give it four stars for pulling away from the traditional fairy tale soundtrack and tackling something more contemporary."
1,"hey, let's promote Rufus!!","The record company just wanted to promote their new American idol, Rufus Wainwright (did I spell that correctly?) and that's why John Cale's version of ""Hallelujah"", which was in the movie, doesn't appear in the soundtrack. Maybe I missed the whole point of what a soundtrack is supposed to be, but I thought the music from the movie is supposed to be featured!"
4,score and Monsieur Hood,"I really liked this movie, liked this soundtrack... unfortunately, I'd much more prefer a CD of the score by Harry Gregson-Williams as well as something of the funny ""Monsieur Hood"" song."
2,"A few good songs, but only one true standout","If there is one reason to get this album, it is Rufus Wainwright's rendition of ""Hallelujah."" While I have heard many recordings of his voice, I have to say that this is one of my favorites. His vocals are simply gorgeous; low throat tones that croon the melancholy lyrics with a seeming ease and nonchalant manner. His piano playing is also top notch, making this rendition even more poignant. While the version in the movie is wonderful in and of itself, this version is a true treasure that you'd be lucky to find on an album this saturated with all that is ""radio-friendly."""
4,Maybe You'll Be Lonesome Too . . .,"We played a medley of songs from this soundtrack for our region-wide band performance, and it was the most fun I've ever had with music. This CD has great music by great artists and I would highly recommend it. It has everything from bouncy and upbeat to sad and lonely, and I love it. A song for every mood."
4,Not bad..,I thought this CD was alright. It contained all the major songs that were in the movie that were sung by regular artists. Exactly what I was looking for. I believe there's another CD out that contains the other songs.
2,"Seems to be missing something....really, really","This soundtrack is an okay collection of the music that fit the film so well. But yet it seems to be missing something.It has the popular songs that ""make you want to dance."" Along with the comical version of I'm A Believer sung by Eddie Murphy, the voice of Donkey. While only including one little track of the film's beautiful instrumential score.I was also hoping the song with the lyrics of ""why can't we be friends,"" would be on the CD too.In my opinion this movie soundtrack is groovy, but to a point, cause this music can be found in so many other places. To me it seems that this music is much more enjoyable when experienced with the movie and not by itself."
2,"Loved the movie, now where is the CD with the score??","Saw the movie last week, I really loved it, and I also loved the great score. So I went to the store to buy it, only to find out that the soundtrack-CD is just another collection with popsongs. And oh yeah, at the very end there's one single track with score too... Come one Dreamworks, bring on the score CD!!"
3,Not all the original artists!!,"By reading the other reviews, you would get the impression there are no bad things to say about this CD. HOWEVER, please note that 2 of the songs from the movie are not the same artist on the soundtrack!! That ticks me off!! Joan Jett does Bad Reputation, not the lousy cover version by Halfcocked on this CD. Also, the song Hallelujah is not sung by Rufus Wainright in the movie (although I am a Rufus fan.)So, I was bummed; it only gets 3 stars from me."
1,Where's The Score!?,"Well, to be honest, Shrek's magnificent score struck me the instant the dreamworks logo hit the screen. This album has one track of score. While it's a good track, there's just so much that could have been done!Sure, the songs are fun. But you could get many of them elsewhere and probably have. The score to this movie was very, very touching and wonderfully done. If they don't release a companion album in the near future, I'm going to be very disappointed and quite possibly outraged.These are fine songs, and there is nothing wrong with them. However as an album for the movie Shrek it doesn't capture the film's musicality in the slightest. A high disappointment."
1,Shrek Fan,"My Family and I totally love the Movie""Shrek"". My kids dance to all the songs so I thought I would buy the Soundtrack. I was very disappointed to discover that some of the songs weren't perfomned by the same artists that were in the movie! Especially the heartfelt song ""Hallelujah"" which is my personal favorite, is just not the same as on the soundtrack, the movie version is much better. Therefore I decided not to purchace this cd, and am glad I read other reviews first."
2,wrong song!,"I ordered Shrek with ""Hallelujah"" as sung by John Cale. Sent the first one back and received the EXACT same one I sent back. I don't understand why I can't get that particular song. By the way, the CD is still upopened.Thank You.Greg Chatman"
1,mis-leading!,Shrek is a great film with great animation and a great sound track.. BUT having bought the album (supposedly of the soundtrack) I find that not all of the tracks are by the artists used in the film. It would be fine if they mentioned this on the cd but this is a bit like seeing a Robbie Williams concert then finding that the album of the tour was recorded by an unknown session musician. Come on music industry - stop trying to con the listeners!
3,This isn't the music from the movie...,"The music in the movie is wonderful, but two of the songs I really wanted were done by different artists on the soundtrack. Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" and John Cale's ""Hallelujah"" really set the mood for the scenes they accompanied. It was disappointing to find they were substituted on this CD."
5,awesome,"Shrek is totally awesome with a wicked sondtrack to keep you grooving at home and with friends. ""I Believe"" is my favourite track on the cd with a funky groove that sticks in your head."
2,I hope there's no profanity on it! That would b a real shame,"This soundtrack just came out, and already 3 people want to sell theirs as used? That's not a good sign! I am aware that nowadays it's awfully easy, if you have a CD burner and ripping software, to buy a CD, rip of the songs and sell the CD. But most people, I would think, when they want to support a product, show their support by keeping their CD and letting others buy their own copies. Selling your CD used for under $11 is like saying it's not even worth that much to you. I have not heard the soundtrack CD, but I hope that no song on it is full of profanity. That would be inappropriate indeed, purposeless, shameful and unnecessary."
2,Uneven Song Selection,"The only reason I bought this soundtrack was for the version of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" sung by Rufus Wainwright. I couldn't find that version on another CD. Didn't care for the rest of the songs on this CD that much."
3,A Pretty Good Soundtrack,"This CD hops through all different kinds of music. From Halfcocked's punk rock ""Bad Reputation""(featuring lyrics by Joan Jett), to Jason Wade(the lead singer from Lifehouse)'s soft and inspired ""You Belong to Me"". But it is a pretty good soundtrack. There are some nightmare songs though, such as Leslie Carter's cutsie pop terror ""Like Wow!"", so be careful! Also, don't miss John Powell's inspired original score(a.k.a., ""True Love's First Kiss"")."
4,"A good addition to your ""family"" cd collection","My 17-month old son is addicted to Shrek. So when I bought the CD, it was a real pleasure to ""bring the movie"" into the car with us. At first I thought I would be disappointed by the omission of the medleys and karoke at the end of the movie, but we have really enjoyed the songs on the CD. Some are played during the credits at the end of the movie (or maybe some piece of it played as an instrumental during the movie) but we love those songs too, for example the song ""Best Years of our Lives"" by the BaHa Men. For me the most beautiful and haunting song is ""It is You (I Have Loved All Along)"". This Cd has been a good addition to our family music. We have an 8 year old who likes it too."
1,I've been gypped!!!,"I loved the movie so much that I wanted to recapture the feeling by listening to the ""original soundtrack"" (isn't that why people buy soundtrack albums?). Boy, was I disappointed when I listened to the CD!!! They have included hardly any of the music as originally orchestrated in the film. The music on this CD sounds nowhere near as good as in the movie. I wanted the music from the movie, dammit!! I feel ripped off!Moreover, the CD is only about 40 minutes long! The producers had plenty of headroom to include parts of the original score. They were so bone-headed!I'll have to resort to listening to the DVD when it becomes available. Maybe I'll try to ""rip"" the soundtrack..."
5,All the songs you love from the movie right here!,"As I've been reading the other reviews for this cd, I've been rather puzzled. Very little of the original score is on this cd, I agree. But a great portion of the movie has popular songs in the background. With catchy ""I'm a Believer"" (done by both Smashmouth and Eddie Murphy) and other songs from the movie, the cd is full of fun and quality songs. I personally enjoyed being able to associate all the songs with their appearances in the movie. This soundtrack is a wonderful addition to my (and hopefully soon your!) collection."
4,Rufus is Wonderful,"This is going to be an unusually short review for me. There are some enjoyable tracks on this CD, but the high point for me is the incomparable Rufus Wainwright's ethereal, spine-tinglingly moving song, Hallelujah. If I'm not mistaken, this highlight song is included on none of his albums to date. That's a shame. I would urge you, if you're unfamiliar with this young singer/songwriter, to make his acquaintance soon. He's genetically predisposed to be a musical wunderkind, as his father is Loudon Wainwright III, and his mom is Kate McGarrigle. With that sort of pedigree, and with a name like Rufus, how could the kid fail?BEK"
1,Where's John Cale?,"I don't get it. This movie is great for adults and kids because of it's mature theme wrapped in the fun of a fairytale. The point of the story that brought all the levels together was the scene accompanied by Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah rendered brilliantly by John Cale. (Hat's off to those making these decisions). How did that get left off the sountrack? Rufus Wainright?? Ok, he's got some credential's as a folk singer, mostly inherited, but it's awful in comparison.Got my money back and bought ""Fragments of a Rainy Season"""
3,What happened to John Cale?,"Although the CD is filled with up beat hits from the movie this critic was very dissappointed to find that the artist, John Cale, that performs the Leonard Cohen son ""Halleluja"" in the movie was replaced with Rufus Wainright on the movie soundtrack. Although Wainrights performance is heartfelt it lacks the grit and saddness conveyed by Cale."
3,Not entirely honest,"I got this cd for one song and one song only - Hallelujah by John Cale - got Hallelujah by Rufus Wainwright. Rufus is great and that's the reason I kept the cd, but why is it advertised as sung by John? After much research, looks like big companies can mess with their customers and get away with it - but anywhoo, being I really really like Rufus' version of Hallelujah, I'm happy. ""I'm a believer"" is cute too, but that's about it."
3,Where's John Cale? Where's Your Ability to Read?,"Sorry for the rant, but if a person buys a CD that lists a song as being performed one artist -- say Rufus Wainright -- and then is suprised when it's not performed by another -- say John Cale -- that person's rating just doesn't have any credibility. He must really be bummed about the I Am Sam soundtrack.That said, Shrek is a better than average soundtrack, especially coming from an animated kids' movie. It's loaded with energy and fun songs kids and adults like to sing along to, whether they admit it or not (especially All-Star, I'm a Believer and Bad Reputation). And Hallelujah, though not the John Cale version that was in the film, is perfect and touching as played and sung by Rufus Wainright.For fans of the movie, the Shrek soundtrack is a nice complement. For music lovers, it falls a little in the rankings but still has plenty to offer in the way of pop fun."
1,Shrek,"I purchased the Shrek CD for the single score track by Harry Gregson-Williams, which is a magical sweeping melodic musical triumph. Unforetunately however, I also had to pay out for the movies collection of inappropriately placed collection of rock songs that spoilt the ambience of the movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that the some of the songs aren't well, ok! They just have no business being in this movie. These rock tracks simply ruined what was a great piece of fairytale story telling. Hey but don't worry, as long as the majoritory audience accepts them, who cares if the movie is compromised."
5,An awesome CD!!!,I bought this CD thinking expecting all of the great songs from the movie to be on it. It is a fun CD. I love to just play it and sing along and have a good time. It is totally worth the money!
2,SCORE!,"Don't get me wrong, the songs are really okay, but it is just ... I want the wonderful John Powell & Harry Gregson-Williams score. The idea of a second CD as they did it with Romeo & Juliet is quite good. AND NECESSARY!!!! To all you guys at Dreamworks: you have great music, so SHARE it!!!!!!!!!!!!FaithfullyAlfred"
3,More Like 3 1/2 Stars,"This Soundtrack is good. Good as in average. It's got some good songs, like ""All Star"", ""It is You (I have loved)"" and ""I'm a Believer"", but nothing really memorable like something Disney would come up with. Although I do give Dreamworks Records credit for trying, it just did't work as well as The Road to El Dorado or The Prince of Egypt did."
4,"Great, but missing 2 things.","I docked them a star for leaving off 2 important songs.First off, you should know that the version of ""I'm a Believer"" that you hear on the radio (and in the movie) is NOT the same one you get here. The radio mix is perkier and more 60s-esque, where as the album version seems a bit more edgier and harder.Also, you may recall how prominent a role the song ""Hallelujah"" had in the movie. That version, the one in the movie, was by - John Cale. The version on the album is by Rufus Wainwright. WTH? That makes no sense.I suggest you buy the CD, obtain the 2 missing tracks, and burn the real version of the soundtrack."
5,LOVED IT! The perfect Wedding Night Movie for us!!!,"My husband and I got married and for our ""honeymoon"" went to see Shrek and LOVED IT!!! It is a beautiful love story. We especially liked the moral that no one is perfect and everyone is beautiful in someone's eyes. The sound track is exceptional! I have been listening to it almost constantly since I bought it! I especially love the song ""It is You"". I plan to sing that to my husband when we renew our vows in August in front of our friends and relatives!"
4,"You'll Never Believe Who Wrote ""I'm A Believer""","""I'm A Believer"" was a big hit for the Monkees, but let's give credit where credit is due: the young writer of that song was none other than Neil Diamnond."
2,"Has Its Good and Bad, Mostly Bad Though","The overrated animated comedy ""Shrek"" has an ok album, the Baha Men song ""Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""My Beloved Monster"" are great as well as the instrumental ""True Love's First Kiss"" but Smash Mouth's annoyingly overrated (like the movie) song ""All Star"" appears, as well as an unbelievably bad rendition of ""I'm a Believer"" followed by an equally annoying rendition by Eddie Murphy. ""Bad Reputation"" was also annoying and an inferior version of ""Hallelujah"" is featured. Not very recommended."
2,Only OK.,"Sure Smashmouth's ""I'm A Believer"" is down with it, but mostly everything else is, ""ehhh, weird"". The Baha Men one is OK, I've heard Smashmouth's ""All Star"" in a couple other movies, and yeah."
3,"No ""damn"" words for my kids.","I bought the cd after the movie, I had not paid any attention to the words. I wish I would have before I bought it. ""I don't give a damn about my reputation"" is not one of the songs I want my kids repeating. The music is great, as long as I skip two songs I don't want my kids to hear..."
2,"Great, except","The whole reason I ordered this CD was for the song Hallelujah. It previewed to be sung by John Cale, but in fact on the CD it is Rufus Wainwright. I was very disappointed. I just like John Cale's version better and I ended up having to purchase the Scrubs soundtrack to get it."
4,Better Than The Movie!,"I think the soundtrack for SHREK is actually better than the movie. I thought SHREK was funny, of course, but the plot and storyline seemed kind of childish. The movie, basically, was for kids rather than the whole family. Anyways, this soundtrack is pretty cool. My favorite tracks are the ones by Smash Mouth and Leslie Carter. I especially like ""I'm A Believer"", which is a remake of The Monkees' song. I enjoyed all the other tracks, too. This is great for both kids and adults. If you've seen the movie, then this is a definite must-have. Even if you haven't, you should still consider buying the soundtrack."
3,Ommision of a great track,"Hi, I would like to comment on how nice the soundtrack is, but the greatest flaw is probably the ommission of a very important track. Where's the one with the female humming that you hear in the beginning of the movie? It's also the same tune that she sings in front of a bird. I am very disappointed that this song or piece has been left out. It is a remarkable theme that is very fitting to the medieval setting of this movie, and probably the most catchy. I was hoping to hear more to this piece rather than the vocals. I hope there will be a revision to the contents of the soundtrack."
3,A few surprises ...,"Ok, so I haven't see the movie yet, but I bought the soundtrack because I noticed Jason Wade (from the band Lifehouse) had a song (track 8- You Belong To Me) on the album. That's the whole reason I bought this cd. That song is wonderful and Jason Wade continues to amaze me. The guitar sounds beautiful and his voice fits the song wonderfully. There are other good songs on the soundtrack: Smash Mouth's cover of ""I'm a Believer"", and I hate to admit this, but the new Baha Men song is catchy and doesn't annoy you to death like that other song (you know the one I'm referring to)."
3,"Yeah, what J. Deighton said, I think.",The song Hallelujah from the movie itself is done by John Cale right? Why did it change to Rufus on the soundtrack?!! ...disappointing. Did I miss something? I got the CD for John Cale and Jason Wade. I only got half.
3,"""Hey film score lovers-there is hope in sight!!!""",Everyone who was dissapointed with the song soundtrack should listen to this.I've heard rumours that there is a complete score album of the fantastic orchestra score of John Powell and Harry Gregson Williams in the works.But we will have to wait a little while because it will be released in November when the movie will be re-released in theaters.
4,Great music for kids and adults,"My children and I really like this CD. I'm always trying to find music that they like and I like also, and this is it. The only flaw is that one of the songs has some profanity and another has some suggestive language, neither of which are appropriate for young children. But overall it's terrific."
5,enjoyable,i had this item before in a cd - but one of my cars only has a cassette player - so now my kids can hear it in all my cars
3,Falls short,"All of the songs on the album are a good representation of the movie but Hallelujah and Bad Reputation for as they are done by different artists. When you listen to a movie soundtrack, you want it to bring back those memories from the movie. These two songs are done by different vocal artists. Why you would include different artists is beyond me.Also, the soundtrack also needed more of the instrumental music."
3,Where is the SCORE???,"While the movie was okay, and the ""songs"" were fair, I want to know where is the score? I was, like many others here whom have posted a review, very disappointed when we learned there was no score release. And only one piece of score on the ""soundtrack"". Let's all hope and pray that one day they will release a score. And a complete and full one at that!!"
2,Hallelujah!,"Rufus Wainwright's cover of Jeff Buckley's cover of John Cale's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" is not nearly as good as Jeff Buckley's cover of John Cale's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah."" It isn't even as good as John Cale's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah."" However, it is better than Leonard Cohen's version of ""Hallelujah."" The poem ""Hallelujah,"" also by Leonard Cohen, is better than all of the other Hallelujahs except for Jeff Buckley's cover of John Cale's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah."" There, glad that's settled."
4,Great soundtrack!!!,"This CD is missing one thing... hard rock. Otherwise, it would be a 5-star CD. With music from Eels, Jason Wade, and Smash Mouth, it's worth the money."
3,minor correction,"haven't listened to this cd as i get all the music when i watch the movie (which i do regularly). but contrary to whatever is written in these reviews (for example, ""Rufus Wainwright ... pen winsome, longing tunes""), rufus wainwright did not write 'hallelujah' (that honor belongs to leonard cohen) and did not do the version in the movie (that was john cale). this is not meant to detract from wainwright's version, only to give credit where credit is due."
3,Not what I wanted,"I like the cd and think the songs are good, but what I was hoping for was more of the Shrek in the Swamp Karioke. My kids love that part of the movie and I think they should come out with a cd based on those songs alone. I will keep this one but if they do have the songs from the end of the movie, I would like to buy it also."
3,Fun...but it could have been better!,"Last month I had the privellge to see an advance screening of ""Shrek."" And the first thing I noticed was the excellent score. So I finally bought the soundtack, looking forward to the 1 score song it has, and I am kind of dissapointed. The 1 score song is great, for being so short, but there are a lot more themes missing - although track 4 is my favorite theme with lyrics slapped on it. But, the other songs are fun. If you like so-called ""soundtracks"" filled with songs, I recommend it. P.S. Track 4, 10, 11, and 13 are great! And I'm really 13."
4,so so,well i enjoy the songs on the album but my comments are there is some homo instrument smash mouth uses on im a believer which completely kills and i with out it it would of been a good cover. Wasn't counting crows in the movie? Wheres accidentally in love. but get the album its worth it.
5,FROM A HOMEMAKER WITHOUT CHILDREN,"While I grant that I am probably nowhere near the average listener for this CD, I loved this album. Because the lyrics get lost if I play it around the house, I listen to it on my car CD player. Most of the lyrics are exciting, or sweet, or stimulating. I'm always looking for fun music that gets me going and laughing. Smashmouth is fabulous, and I now know I want more of their stuff. I felt totally rocked by the no-names that I'd otherwise have known nothing about, like Leslie Carter, Baha Men, and The Proclaimers. The Eels were a bit too much for me, and Halfcocked, as well. I also don't get much out of the love ballad by Dana Glover. I'll be taping the better rock cuts for working out to!! I must have played this about 40 times during the first week I owned it."
1,Where Can I get the Soundtrack to the Movie???,"Rarely do I have any desire to buy the soundtrack of a movie. But having just returned from seeing Shrek today, I knew I wanted the soundtrak. There was a mixture of some great catchy new pop tunes, stirring orchestral pieces, and a few oldies but goodies. Imagine my shock when I went to Amazon and started clicking on the samples! Only a couple of excerps from the movie! Oh well. No more money to the entertainment wizs from me for this movie - unless they decide to release the sountrack from the movie someday."
1,This is not the soundtrack!,"If you are looking for proper shrek soundtrack, buy ""Shrek: Original Motion Picture Score"" item and not this one. This CD contains only some songs from the movie, some of them you won't even recognize. :o("
4,shrek,why isn't the medley of songs at the end of the movie on the CD? That is my daughters favorite.
2,No John Cale,"Purchased this cd for the version of Hallelujah by John Cale, which is in the description. I dont know who Rufus Wainwright is but his version lacks the sound or soul of John Cale's version. Descrition needs to be updated."
4,Different soundtracks..confusion?,"I bought the original soundtrack on another site because there are two versions...one with Rufus W. on the song, Hallelujah and a different singer on this version.Make sure you like the version you are buying."
2,Win 2000 = problems with this thing,"I have spent the night trying to get this thing to do a disk copy at first I thought I could do a disk copy with only one cd drive....copy to hd disk then to blank...Then I tried to find a way to create an image with which I could then create a copy from no luck...I finally ripped out another CD drive from another machine. Plugged it in put cd's in each drive to check they both worked no problem...run cd extreme, select each drive crash...and hard, everytime I try it kills win 2000. Tried downloading all the latest software from the web site no luck...Software has its quirks to...The drive was cheap but now I gotta buy adaptec so I can do CD copy"
1,not good,"the price is high, and the software is bad, which makes it slower than other drives, even if the speeds it says are equal, this is slower"
1,What a fat log of good these reviews are,"For a person who is looking to buy one these, all this back bitting is actually no help at all, 0/10 for product review usefulness."
1,Not WINDOWS Me compatible,This item is Not repeat NOT WINDOWS Me compatible. Even though on the box it came in it says FOR WINDOWS 95/98/Me/2000 NT 4.0 it's not Me frendly user. Calling SONY Tech support will conferm this. I even had to take a digital picuure of the box with my SONY camera and send it to Tech support because one of their technicians called me every thing but a liar.
2,Love AND Hate this drive!,"I bought mine over a year ago. For the first 13 months it was a very good drive. (Guess what... the warranty is 12 months!) I was usually unsuccessful in burning at 8x unless copying a cd. Most often I settled for 4x burning. It worked fine with very few coasters. Now enter the problem... At 13 months it started causing POST failures during bootup. BIOS will only detect about half of the time. The other half of the time I get ""Invalid IDE device"" messages. When it detects OK, the drive still works fine. After much trouble-shooting, swapping IDE controllers, slaves, masters, etc, and contacting SONY tech support, it became very obvious that this drive is my problem. I still have the drive installed and I'm still using it, however I'm now looking for a replacement. Booting 2-3 times can't be good for the rest of my components, so it's time to make a change. Would I buy another SONY??? Maybe... maybe not."
5,Worth to buy!!,"Sony CDRW only takes 5 mins to burn a CDR and 10 mins to finish up the CDRW burning. You can test before burning in order to make sure that you won't waste your CDR disc. You also do not need drivers for Win 98, ME, and 2000 because Microsoft has already included the drivers. Large CDR buffers make the CD burning more stabilize. There is a headphone jack in the front faceplate that you can plug-in your headphone and listen your CD. So convenience!"
5,"Rusaika, opo. 114 Act. l O Silver","This is another version of my favorite from Song to the Moon. It is really good, but not a great favorite of mine. I liked other versions better."
4,Solid Improvement,"3.5 stars actually.The artwork, and the plotting improves dramatically in this second collection of Marvel stories. Unlike most of the first collection, these stories mostly feel like they could take place in the Star Wars universe and are viable adventures that the heroes could have had before The Empire Strikes Back.Still though, they are not stellar work by any means, merely solid. In retrospect, due to the authors not knowing where George Lucas was going, some of the things you see cause some cognitive dissonance. No fault of the authors, but it is still jarring to see things you know are untrue.Decent artwork, and stories in a rather large collection make this a worthwhile collection if you'd like to read a sort of slightly altered universe of what the Star Wars characters did between the movies."
4,WARNING: These reviews are for another book,"All of the reviews concernStar Wars a Long Time Ago Dark Encounters, which is volume 2 in the Dark Horse reprint series and contain issues #21 - 38 of the Marvel comics series (including the Mike Golden issue).""Resurrection of Evil"" is volume 3 and contains issues #39 - 53, including Marvel's six issue adaptation of ""The Empire Strikes Back.""Both are worth seeking out, but volume 2 starts in the middle of a story line concerning Luke, Leia and Han trapped on a gambling casino in space. There is no Lando Calrissian since all of these stories take place before TESB. Volume 3 begins with TESB and continues with tales of the rebels searching for a new place to use as a base (after Hoth was invaded) and searching for Boba Fett and the carbon-frozen Han Solo."
5,Love this workout,"I bought this tape last year when I was new to step, loved it and I'm sad that I can't find it on DVD at a good price. My VCR/DVD player stopped working and replacing that was way more expensive than buying a new DVD player. Anyhow, if you remember how cool it was to workout in these clothes, the ""modern stage"" and the music, then this dvd is awesome!! Watch the trailer on collagevideo.com. Gin Miller's cueing is great. The workout is very intense but the moves are not tricky, and the choreography is athletic, not dancey like the new dvd's out there!! Perfect for begginers/intermediates and advanced step people who want to feel the cardio burn!! It's also a great complimentary video to Step Reebok: The Video, also by Gin Miller."
5,Great Pan for Small Baking Needs,"I love this pan! At first when it arrived I was apprehensive because I figured the loaf sizes would be way too small for what I had in mind (simply mini loaves for a large bread basket), but once I actually used it to make various batches of bread I fell in love. The loaves pop right out when finished (no sticking AT ALL, even with me pressing as much dough as possible in one slot) and cleanup is a cinch. THis is a great product and is just perfect for mini loaves. I also found it makes perfectly sized rolls, or loaves for individual sandwiches, like sloppy joes, or hoagies. We had pulled pork the first night I used these and my boyfriend used the bread for his sandwich."
5,LOVE IT!,I bought 2 of these and I love them! I use them for brownies and cakes and muffins! My Husband loves it too!
4,step by step help at last,I found this to be a wonderful book. It showed me how to get started back in an exercise routine after many years of gaining weight. It let me target the areas where I needed help and showed me what to do week after week in my new routine. It's great!
4,Not bad! Great for nutrition beginners!,"I was expecting more from this book. It was well-written but I would've like to have seen more of an outline or ""jump-start"" program. Maybe that's just my style, though.There were wonderful recipes and good charts. Plus, there were simple workouts."
2,From the perspective of a beginner,"I have never seen projective geometry before and the explanation of the basics is very good, in the beggining. The standard quickly drops, some key terms are introduced with scant or no detail and then used heavily in subsequent sections and derivations. Maybe this book would be effective if it were covered in lectures and tutorials, unfortunately I don't have that luxury."
3,"good, but too long","This is a book about adventure and honor and a ""revenge thing"". I wish it were 100 pages shorter than it is. There is too much description of nature, too much much political thinking in it. Apart from that, it is a lively description of one man fighting for his personal honour. As such, it is a very good read. I award it three stars only because of several repetitions of the same thoughts. The dramatic climax happens, but it is not so dramatic after all. A great read for adult teenagers and those with an independent spirit in their soul. Give it a try. This should be L'Amour at his best, if you do not like westerns."
1,A let down for me.......,"I enjoyed this book until the very end when it.....just stopped. No wrap up, no what happened, just stopped. A grand build up all for nothing at the end."
3,OK condition,"This book wasn't in as pristine condition as most of the other books I have ordered, but glad to get it."
1,"Some say ""Sweeping Adventure""More like Sleeping Adventure!!","Before reading this book, I had high hopes for it. It sounded good, lots of adventure, peril, danger and a likeable sounding main character. Though, as I go to read this book, I find adventure to be walking around in the snow, peril is siting up in a tree, danger was a weird guy stalking the main character, amd the main character so laughably fake and unbeleivable that I knew from the first couple of pages that this book was HORRIBLE. To top it all off, the ending is so bad that I wondered why I even bothered to finish all 367 pages of pure boredom. I actualy fell alsleep reading this! Pleas DO NOT buy this book [If you can call it that!]there are so many other good books to buy... and they are not this one."
1,Boring....but funny (in a boring kind of way),"I read most of this wet towel while in a tent, snowbound, while climbing Denali. Even under those circumstances, where your shirt labels make interesting reading, this book sucked. My partner and I took to making fun of it, it was so bad. I'd not read anything by L'amour before, and if this is indicative of his writing talent, I'm glad of it. I think you'd have to have about a 8th grade education to actually think this book is good. Not to insult 8th graders, but most adults have moved beyond crap like this (romance novel readers notwithstanding)."
5,"Outstanding, one of the best books he's ever written.","The story was outstanding. You cheered on the main character throughout the book. It gave you an education on how the Indians survived. It contained everything a book should, suspense,love of one's history, compassion, bravery, where there's a will there's a way. I know that if Mr. L'Amour stilled lived, there would be a sequel and since I finished the book, I kept waiting for the sequal. Like all of his books, it was outstanding. In my opinion, Mr. L'Amour was the greatest author of the 20th century."
5,"A Fantastic ""Curve Ball"" from Louis L'amour","I won't get into a plot synopsis (you can read that in the book's info), but suffice to say that I bought this book when it first came out in paperback in the mid-80's (back then I was a teenager and could not afford hardbacks) and it instantly became one of my favorite books from my all-time favorite author. A riveting tale with a SUPERB ending. FIVE STARS."
5,"Bad Indian, Good Indian, Great Story","As usual, Louis L'Amour, America's best story teller, writes this novel in such a way that you do not want to put it down. Joe Mack is the kind of person all American boys want to grow up to be like. I never wanted to go to Russia until I read the description of the mountains and the wilderness that only L'Amour's great style could describe. I now want to go and see that untouched wilderness, before, like the American wilderness, it becomes marred by human destruction. I hope there will be discovered a manuscript, that Louis L'Amour left before he died, for a sequel to this story. Joe Mack has some unfinished business to tend to, and of course, a romance to return to."
5,Fantastic Read!,"I've read almost every book L'amour wrote, but if I had to chose a favorite out of all of them The Last of the Breed would win, hands down!!! I've read it at least 3 or 4 times."
3,A good yarn,"This is a good story, deserving neither the overly fulsome praise nor the sour dismissals found in some of the reviews here. I've read it a couple of times over the years, and for many years it was the only L'Amour book I'd read. It's a good survival adventure tale, very servicably written.Here's a tip: for those who liked this story, check out Dersu Uzala, a Kurosawa movie set in Siberia; the protagonist is an old Siberian hunter and trapper, and you'll get a real flavor of the country and way of life described by L'Amour in Last of the Breed."
5,"This one novel is at a time different (set on another continent, another time) and still the same (bravery)","You cannot be wrong when you buy a Louis Lamour book. He told stories about many situations, many periods of time, many places. His characters are so lively, the settings perfect and descriptions never boring.The structure of the plots makes the book a page turner. Once you read one of Lamour's books, you get addict. Be careful! :-) This one story differs from the others, but it is long and you would like it to be even longer. Really beautiful, with a central character who will won all the battles, defeat all the systems, vanquish all the climates ... I cannot tell you more, but it is THE book by Lamour you must read."
5,The Last of The Breed,"I've collected virtually all of his books in paperback and a few of the ones finished by his kids. Breed does not disappoint. He brings the characters and scenes to life in my head making reading this book so much more than any movie ever could. Frequently read awhile before going to sleep each nite, but I again lost pleasurable hours of sleep reading this book. Sorry he passed away before he could write the sequel to it."
5,Typical LaMour - Good book,"An interesting book. It is typical LaMour, with an old west story theme brought into the 20th century. It moves along well and has good intrigue. If you enjoy Louis LaMour books, you will like this book a lot!"
3,good book but not his best,after reading nearly two dozen books by mr lamore i found this one definately different. i liked it and at some parts it had a lot of action but for a while in the middle all the character seemed to do was make shoes from the hides of the animals he had killed. then it picked up again. i felt the ending was quite rushed. it leaves you wondering about what happend not only the the antagonist but also the girl from the villiage. nevertheless it was worth the time to read.
3,Disappointing Ending,The book is great and keeps your interest throughout the book. Then it just ends. You feel left hanging. Fun read though.
3,Pretty Good,"It was a page turner despite some rambling, lengthly, repetitious segments. I get the feeling he wants to be Jack London's successor, but he needs more economy in his prose and plotting to approach the great man.The strong points were the themes--the regression of a modern military test pilot to his Native American roots in hostile Siberia, a retracing of the ancient migration route to Alaska, the corruption and violence of communist Russia in the 80s and the resulting suffering of its people. The weakness was the plotting. Too many sidetracks and loose ends.But he is a good, lively writer. I'll try one of his westerns."
2,Disappointing,"After listening to The Walking Drum by Mr. L'Amour and enjoying it so much,I thought I'd try this one,also in the audiobook version.Sorry,Mr. L'Amour but I was very disappointed.It was very tedious and redundant.It seemed the story started to go in a circle and kept going in circles.It took alot of will power to finish it."
3,"Good story, but very monotonous at times.","I liked the story, the setting, and the characters, however, the constant descriptions of the protagonist's ""perfect camp sites"" and the like quickly grew monotonous. I do give the ending kudos, as it manages to pull off the very difficult task of leaving the reader satisfied, while at the same time, leaving the door open for a sequel."
5,TOP NOTCH ADVENTURE,This is an adventure book. Man versus the wild. Half American Indian pilot crashes down over Soviet Union and has to walk several thousand miles to return home. Of course he can't just walk out because the whole Soviet Army is on the look out for him and actively searching for him.
3,Not I-Roy's Best - But there's a few half-decent tracks...,"This album is weak in relation to his better stuff - there are a few marginally decent tracks like Fire Stick but even those are nowhere near the quality of the real I-Roy hardcore roots stuff. Right now I'm listening to an album called ""Reggae Best: I-Roy"" and it's way way better and more authentic sound. I'm a big I-Roy fan from days of old, so trust me - get the real ting! Peace!"
5,"KEN WELLS GREAT AUTHOR, FUN READING!","I just love this author. I first read Meely LaBauve. I did a search and found he had followed up that book with this one. I am an adult, but I get sick of reading heavy adult material. On the other hand I want good literature so I must say these books by Ken Wells are in the ""all age"" category like Tom Sawyer is. Both books were well written and kept my interest so that i did not want to put them down and I did not want them to end.If you're looking for some good books for male readers, these are great. There are not enough books written with boys as the target audience, and then we wonder why boys don't like to read.Buy this book but first buy Meely LaBauve. Buy them for your son's, your pre-teen relatives, or your favorite kid. Then sneak a read. You'll be glad you did.P.S.Buy them for girl's too, especially the one's who don't wear pink and like to get their feet muddy."
4,Chung Do Kwan revisited,"This is a good work of one of the most respected ""styles"" of Taekwondo out there. It is a great companion to both Korean Karate and Black Belt Korean Karate both by the 2nd Head of the Chung Do Kwan GM Son, DukSung. I would recommend this book to anybody that studies ""traditional"" ""Korean Karate"" I think the authors did a good job in describing the art of Chung Do Kwan well."
5,Lloyd Webber Plays Lloyd Webber,"I got an e-mail recommending this CD....Being the Andrew Lloyd Webber fan that I was, I just decided to buy it thinking it was his greatest hits by the original casts of his Play.Boy was I wrong...but pleassantly so. Julian Lloyd Weber does a brilliant job of his brothers work...Purely instrumentational and incredibly beautiful... definately worth buying if your are ALW fan"
3,Worth buying but....,The tracks with the orchestration are lovely. But several tracks sound as if someone pushed a few buttons on an old Casio keyboard then walked away. I felt lousy pushing the skip button on a musician of Webbers caliber.
4,Too much of a good thing and I prefer the originals,"Certainly Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote some superb melodies and certainly his brother Julian is an accomplished, outstanding cellist. That said, while it is fine to listen to a couple of these songs at a time played in this format, the real greatness of Andrew was in his collaboration with his lyricists like Tim Rice, and the songs just work better in my opinion as Broadway/theatre, with the rich diversity of soloists who have sung them."
2,Beware the translation,"I believe that people need to know more about the prophets and prophecy, that's never a waste of time. But in this particular case the original Yates book has been translated into Spanish in a hasty and clumsy way, certainly unfit for consumption by readers who would like to know how certain things should be preached or taught in that language. By all means let the buyer beware of this drawback."
1,Rare but not the best,I owned one of their live EP CD called Electric Folklore Live and this album is not worth-owning as it's an old unreleased tracks during their performance at King Biscuit Flower Hour show. It's a disappointing album to own as it does not carry the group's best songs as compared to Electric Folklore Live CD.
4,good resource for ministers,"My husband had to read this for his seminary class, and it is one we will keep for future reference."
