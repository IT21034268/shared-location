2,Wepahey,"The rhythmically impaired Ivan, an unsuccessful bodybuilder turned ""singer,"" is known as the ""Colombian Elvis"" and is the ""author"" of such lyrical gems as ""I'm Going to Fusagasuga,"" with the following loose translation:I'M GOING TO FUSAGASUGA (presumably copyright by ""Ivan"", 1996)I'm going to Fusagasuga, I'm going to Fusagasuga, hey! I'm going to Fusagasuga, 'Cause that's where my girlfriend lives. Yeah!It is presumed that he will get to Fusagasuga, or wherever, as soon as he saves enough money for the bus fare... Hey, whatever makes the ladies sweat on the dance floor..."
2,"the good,and the bad","I have done several gifts from jars so when I saw these sets of little books I grabbed them up. I have to say, If I could do it again I would not buy this set. The ingred. lists are easy, but the amount the reciever needs to have makes the gift not so much worth it. You need multiple items to add. That makes for a not so good gift in my mind. I would not get this set!!!"
1,Very disappointing,"This book may have 128 pages, but it does not have anywhere near that number of recipes! Each recipe is printed 3 times! So there are maybe about 40 recipes, so I felt very let down. And you have to make sure to buy over-safe mugs. Most of the recipes have to bake in an oven. I don't need 3 pages of the same recipe."
3,Babe Ruth His Story in Baseball,"""Ruth thought there was a lot more to baseball than hitting home runs. He was a ball player. This is what the New York Times said about Babe Ruth. Who is Babe Ruth? Babe Ruth was one of the greatest baseball players to ever live! In his career he hit 714 home runs and batted .342 all time. He played for several teams, but the teams he was the most famous for were the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. He was a pitcher and a outfielder. He is one of the few pitchers to ever to be able to pitch and bat really good!You should read this book if you don't anything about Babe Ruth or if u want to learn more about Babe Ruth. This book tells you a lot of what he did and how all the fans went crazy for him. I recommend this book to any one who loves the game of baseball or loves to read about people."
2,Pre-Amos Moses...,"I'm a Jerry Reed addict. I've been a big fan for over 35 years. If you are ike me and love to hear the Jerry Reed from the 'Amos Moses', 'When You're Hot You're Hot', era (late 60's-early 70's) then this CD is probably not for you.I purchased this disc a while back but was sorely disappointed when I listened to it. The Jerry Reed heard on this disc is a very young Jerry Reed. He does not sing or play guitar with his signature sound which came later during his days with RCA and under the watchful eye of Chet Atkins."
5,Turtles and Husbands,"This delightful, funny, even suspenseful book is ostensibly about the experience of living with a ""turtle nut"" (my term for a turtle enthusiast). The book does deliver quantities of information on that topic, as well as about turtles as pets, caring for turtles, turtle conservation, and more.However, it's also a personal and touching chronicle of a relationship developing between a man and a woman.The author brings a light and humorous touch to the entire book. I often laughed out loud while reading it. And, believe it or not, Confessions of a Turtle Wife is a page turner! I could not put it down. (There is even a chapter about sex that includes a graphic description of the sex act-between consenting adult turtles!)A most enjoyable, informative, and uplifting book-I recommend it highly."
4,A humorous read.....;),"This story almost gave me a glimpse into my 4 year old sons future. He is absolutely in love with Turtles and has a rather large collection of them in various forms of toys, figures etc, we're members of the Turtle Society and our local Sea Life Centre that houses two special Turtles. Our next step is obviously getting a pet turtle. Certainly a fun read."
5,Great!!,I have locks (dreads) and I wanted a product to keep my hair moist in between washes and oiling...this works great...it last all day and it's non-greasy and very light...it also has a nice smell...would recommend it...
1,SO The New Formulary Sucks Arse!,"I'm like WTF Happened!!??!! This product recieved so many great reviews from everybody who has ever styled their hair in dreads or curls, I broke down and tried it (about 3years too late)... The formulary has changed, and unfortunately, so has the product. Some still swear by it, but it just feels strange on my hair, I'll stick with the old Jojoba oil + Water leave-in (or just plain Aloe) thank you very much. But, then also, maybe I used it wrong... I don't know, the product and the reviews just don't match up anymore. Sorry guys F--"
5,Save The Girls!,"Five girls go to a party to a nice house on a lakeside. Five girls disappear without a trace... Now another five girls go there, in order to spend the vacation with the Martins, the owners of the house, in particular with the lovely Ms. Martin. This time, you should not let them die a gruesome death! Because ""nice people"" can sometimes turn out to be... yes, that's right - vampires. The whole house is full of traps, that are intended to catch the poor innocent girls, so that the vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be hunted and to become a hunter instead! Set the traps so that they will capture the villains themselves, using precise timing and good organization.Night Trap was the very first game that used the FMV (full-motion video) technology with live actors. Although it didn't contain nudity or particularly gory scenes, it was considered one of the first games to have a mature content."
4,Not Just Another Sad Song....,"This was THE saddest story I EVER read....I swore off of B.McFadden because of this book...I was actually tired after I read this one. I had so much hope and the let down was so hard....I read this book quite a while ago and I've given B. McFadden/G. Holliday another chance (she's really one of my favorite authors ;-)) B.McFadden wrote this book and I read it. If a topic comes up about a sad story, I'll bring this book up. I'm just a sucker for happy endings and you can look at this ending in more ways than one."
5,Loved the book,"This book is one of my favorites written by Bernice McFadden. The other two were ""Sugar"" and ""Camilla's Roses"".I completed this book in one afternoon, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I could feel both Donovan and Campbell's pain. I highly recommend this book."
4,Cute book,"I was a little skeptical about getting this book because I read ""Sugar"" and ""This Bitter Earth"" and I didn't really like them at all. But I decided to give a sistah a chance. And I must say that it's not a half bad book. I'm glad I got it."
3,Leaves Much Unsaid,"I liked this book- I did. But it left so much unsaid or I at least felt unfulfilled at the end. Not a happy ending, but still an interesting read from one of my favorite authors. I recommend ""Sugar"" if you haven't read it already."
4,Loving Donovan: A Love Story in Three Parts,What I thought was a hopeful love story. Very compelling and exciting read. Everyone who reads will be inspired and can relate this story and the characters.
3,"Good idea, questionable delivery","When I read the reviews on this book, and the synopsis, I knew that I had to have it. Though the conversation and descriptive details initially drew me in, I was left highly confused 3/4 into the story. There seemed to be too many characters being introduced to follow. I almost had to write down my own thoughts in order to follow. I felt that too much of the content was used to create background and not enough time was spent developing this great love I hoped to read about. This is my first book by McFadden and, though I was a bit dissapointed, It will not be my last."
5,Loving Donovan,Book arrived in same condition as listed. The book was excellent and I finished reading it in two days. Thanks
3,Not What I Expected,"Overall, I thought the book was very well written, however, during the Donovan and Campbell relationship, I felt the author rushed through it. The author spent more time in the beginning introducing the characters which is fine, but it didn't tie into the ending as well as I had hoped. I was expecting more, but it never came and before I knew it, I was at the end. It was a fairly quick read, but be forewarned there are some very slow sections in this book."
4,Loving Donovan...,"I appreciated how this story gave a background to the desire or inability to love. How an individual's background impacts who, how, when, or if they will allow themself to ever fall in love.Initially, I did get a little lost following the characters, but by the end of the book I found myself moved and actually crying because of Campbell's desire to love and be loved and Donovan's desire to love, but his inability to love and trust even his own feelings (because of his ""Grammy).I am forever a Bernice McFadden fan."
2,Not Loving Donovan,"Being a fan of McFadden, I was very exciting about sitting down to read this Loving Donovan. After Sugar, I had quite expected this book to blow me away. Unfortunately it did not do this. I found the story line to be a bit ""choppy"". I didn't get a solid grip on the characters. For me if I can't visualize them, the author did not do his/her job.I will continue to support Ms McFadden but I hope her next book reflects the talent she so wonderfully produced with Sugar and her other novels."
5,Great For Little Hands,"I love these markers. They are easy for little hands to color. My 5 year old still loves them, and I got a new set for my 18 month old!"
3,Great start but bitter after-note,"We have a SodaStream soda/seltzer maker, and I bought the Torani Sugar-Free Black Cherry syrup with the hope that it would be a nice complement to SodaStream's flavor lineup, which is missing flavors we really like, like Diet Cherry Zero, or Diet Cherry Dr. Pete (Dr. Pepper). The cherry flavor is there with this syrup, but we find the syrup is not rounded out to be quite sweet enough. And no matter what sweetness, we always experience a bitter aftertaste. What we find is that using a little Equal to offset the aftertaste and enhance the sweetness will help, but of course, that is no good for phenylketonurics. We'll keep looking."
5,"I bought these syrups for Protein shakes.. I like the taste, there's not a nasty aftertaste.. not as sweet as I thought it would","I bought these syrups for Protein shakes.. I like the taste, there's not a nasty aftertaste.. not as sweet as I thought it would be, but i like it.. all for no calories."
5,I Believe the end is at hand,This is a great book. It teaches us to value God's word above all things. It increased my faith in the Bible. I read it 35 years ago and it spoke to me again. The vision of the end times he had is very close to fulfillment. Let us all be ready for the Lord's return.
2,old line of the product,I was disappointed with this product mainly because it wasn't the new line of the world collection. I have not read it anywhere in the description prior to the purchase.
5,Very cool signs.,"My son uses them constatnly. Some signs he knew before I got this set. Now that he knows them all, he always points them out when we're driving. Plan Toys has very good quality toys and this one fits well with all his other toys. They're very stable when he plays with them on a carpet. They're clear and provide for endless possibilities and fun.I would definetly recommend this to others."
2,"Cute, authentic, but the fall over VERY easily","Ordered for our Grandson to play with on a ""Road Rug"". They look cute and add a lot to the ""look"" but are not at all functional because they will not stand up for any length of time when you are playing on the rug."
5,Wonderful addition for cars or blocks,"I bought these signs for my 3 year old who is currently obsessed with road signs. These are awesome, sturdy, well constructed toys. Plan toys are environmentally friendly, educational and unique. The road signs are a fantastic addition to blocks or vehicles. They promote pre-reading skills and imaginative play. I look forward to purchasing more items from this company."
4,Nice Gift.,"I bought this for my four year old nephew, who is completely obsessed with signs. I was hoping they would be a little bigger, as these are only about two inches tall, but I think they are great for their purpose. They will go great with his train sets!"
5,Terrific addition to road or rail play,My two year old loves to add these to his road or rail play. He will often want to take one with him in the car and look at the signs as we drive. They make a nice gift too.Nice quality - nice details - sustainable design -- all typical of Plan Toys.
2,Did not work for my hair dryer,"I could not plug a hair dryer into this adapter, therefore I cannot recommend it. I tried 2 US hair dryers with 3 pronged plugs and neither would fit. I am giving this 2 stars (instead of 1) because it fit my US chargers that are 2 pronged. But as for my hair dryer, I ended up using a friend's adapter instead."
2,Inferior product - look elsewhere,"The big issue with these is that neither the US or EU plus will stay in. They simply fall out due to lack of friction. Maybe this a result of trying to accept too many different plugs or the hard plastic it's made of. Whatever reason, this is a very frustrating product. I'm going to ""donate"" mine to this UK hotel when done with them."
1,Don't buy-defective junk!,I didn't discover until I was in Hong Kong that this adapter was so poorly made that it couldn't even be plugged into the wall. This is a cheap piece of Chinese crap.
4,Great space-saver,"Works as expected. Only problem I have is that the hooks have an abrasive covering that was probably designed to prevent the bike from sliding around, but which unfortunately scratched away my bike frame's reflective stickers. Otherwise, it holds up pretty well."
5,Wonderful,I have 2 mountain bikes and 2 city bikes and I live in a very small apartment. With this product I can hang my 2 mountain bikes high and one of my city bikes below. The space a gained was great.
5,does the job,"Took just a few minutes to set-up and works well.Glad I bought it.**TAKE NOTE**As another reviewer mentioned, make sure you have a strong ceiling or you are anchoring the bike hanger below a stud, as it pushed a piece of my ceiling up. I do live in a poorly built apartment, but check before you put it up and you should be fine."
1,"Looked good, but...","This bike rack seemed like a great way to hang two bikes, but the top rack (on the upper bar) does not secure tight enough to hold a bike secure, it slides down. An expensive mistake."
4,you get what you pay for,"vertical rod snap-locks into place, further adjusting done by spinning the top and bottom feet open/closed. The top rack does indeed slide down which is SUPER annoying. fixed this (forever, hopefully) by throwing a spare allen wrench in the holes of the top part of the rod (the holes are used as part of the snapping/locking extension mechanism). this acts as a pin (like pins on workout machines at the gym) holding the top rack in place. still, keep your lighter bike on top. who knows when that allen wrench will sheer off."
5,"Easy, sturdy, and expectations met","After reviewing some of the (lame) issues previously posted here, I recommend that if you're going to set this up on a slick/smooth floor beneath a smooth ceiling, then improvise and buy some dense, tacky rubber matting and cut a couple of small squares to place under the supports. I placed a piece of 3/4-inch foam under the top support on mine to protect my textured ceiling. No biggie. It took me all of five minutes to assemble and install this unit, and it's rock-solid. I have plenty of room with a relatively low 92"" ceiling to store two bicycles (one mountain, one road) with ample room to spare. The unit complements the ""active, mobile urbanite"" look in my place, and frees up room for me to collect other sundry stuff. Best $52 I've spent in a few months."
4,Works Like a Charm,"This is a great, inexpensive storage solution for cyclists. Assembly was easy. Mounted my time trial bike on the upper and my heavier road bike on the lower and no slippage yet in over 30 days. I mounted the bikes so that the steering systems were facing opposite directions to maximize balance. I recommend mounting the lower bike high enough to allow broom/mop or vacuum access under the tires."
5,Great Value,"This is a sturdy product and a great value. Easy to assemble, I had my bikes hanging in less than 10 minutes. My only gripe was that the package was mangled on arrival but the product inside was in perfect shape."
5,Totally Worth It,"My husband had this installed in the garage and up in no time because it's that easy to do. I love that you can move it around also, which is why I opted for this vs. something that has to be installed stationary to the walls. I'd have like to spend less for something for this use, but the convenience makes up for it."
4,Works pretty well,I have to admit I am still terrified of dropping a bike on my head when I am removing one from the lower rack but so far the hanger has stayed put with surprisingly few readjustments. I bump into it with boxes on a fairly regular basis and that hasn't budged it either. I love how easy it was to install (10 min tops) and it's saving me a ton of space so I just smile about that and wear my helmet while extracting my bike.
3,Dumb Decision,This was a dumb decision on my part. Use it only if your bikes are the same price as the hanger.
4,Great rack!,"The package arrived and within 10 minutes, I was up and running with this bike hanger. I've had 2 fixed gears up for the past 3 weeks now and no problems with it whatsoever. I've read some of the reviews about bikes sliding down the hanger but that hasn't happened to me. Guess they need to tighten it up more. The price is right and it saves me a lot of room...very happy"
4,Better directions needed,"I was very pleased with this purchase. But the lack of good directions for assembly are needed. The thing that got me confused, was the fact that both threaded ends are directional. One is reverse threaded, so when you ratchet the pole snug, and turn the pole clockwise the ends expand.I wouldn't put heavy bikes on the top, and the manufacturer does recommend a weight limit for both bikes. It sure helps clear up some floor space. Give yourself 10 to 12 inches from the wall and your good."
4,"Works great, must be secured carefully",If possible anchor the top to the ceiling. Screw holes are provided for this purpose.Securing the upper bike holder is tricky. Our advice: make sure the clamp is already flat on the flat part of the upper pole from the beginning so it can't slide around to that point and suddenly be loose.You will need to cinch it down very well. Once we got the hang of it our bikes stayed put.
1,Only holds ONE bike,"All of the glowing reviews of this product would be accurate except for one thing - the hooks will not clamp onto one half of the pole. So effectively, this is a 1 bike hanger unless you have tiny bikes. The pole has two sections, a thick tube for one half, and a significantly thinner tube for the other half. The clamps will not even come close to holding on the thinner half. Both the pictures on this site, and the diagrams in the instructions show that you can clamp onto both halves, but this is NOT so. This issue is mentioned in one of the other reviews as well, and appears to be a design flaw rather than a manufacturing problem with the one I received."
2,Outdated for 2007,"I picked this up at the library looking for information on podcasting... unfortunately, most software guides are outdated the moment they're put in print, and this was no exception.Podcasting wasn't even covered,but I thought there might be some basics that I could make use of. But the information on GarageBand basics was TOO basic -- and so outdated that it didn't even apply to my 2006 MacBook.I found the sidebars to be distracting and uninteresting (what was with all the ukelele information). There's got to be a better guide out there. I'll let you know when I find it."
4,She's OK,"Right when I saw Kianna on the Teen Trends Website I Wanted her.When I went to Toysrus (I was not getting a teen trend) I saw Kianna In person and thought that she wasnt nearly as pretty as I saw her online. I still like her butI dont think I want to buy her. But who knows? I might just change my mind. Oh and by the way, the bratz Kianna is spelled Kiana and no way did this Kianna copy her."
4,"What Are You Talking About?- ""Copy Cater""","Whoever wrote ""Copy Cater"" is wrong. The Bratz doll's name is FIANNA, FYI, not Kianna. But I do have to agree with you. She is kinda ugly."
1,I wasn't talking about Fianna,There is a new girl in the Bratz group name Kianna. Go to the Bratz website or mgae's website and see for yourself. She is the Afriacan American one in the wild Wild West Collection. I don't like this doll. I think this doll is ugly.
1,Beautiful Doll...but...,That person's right. The name Kianna is from a Bratz doll. There's a Fianna AND a Kianna. This doll's great but maybe they should change her name...
4,Public Speaking for College and Career,Very pleased with the purchase and the timely manner in which I received my book - I was given a date in October and must say I was pleasantly surprised to received this in five days versus the projected (14) days and I did not pay for expedited shipping. This was awesome customer service. Thanks again.
4,Public Speaking,Book was pretty good and gave detailed information of speeches as well as examples of speeches. Can be helpful for oral class presentations.
4,Good instructional book,"As a minister of the Gospel, I need to be able to present information in a clear and comprehensive manner. This book was as helpful as a homiletics (the art of preaching) book that I used for preparing messages and presentations. It is complete and extensive, without being overbearing in its content. I would recommend it for anyone that will be engaged in public speaking of any kind."
4,Gift for a friend,I got this for a friend who needed it for a college class. She was pleasantly surprised by the good shape the book was in. It looked almost new. And its shipped in plenty of time for the start of her class.
3,Monroe's warranty service sucks,"Be cautious about the warranty. I purchased two sensa-trac shocks to replace the rear OEM shocks on my 2002 Sonoma. The OEM ones blew out (oil all over the place) the first time I hauled a decent load. The new shocks greatly increased my load capacity and improved handling - especially when heavily loaded. After a couple of years of hauling heavy trailers etc, one of the sensa-tracks started leaking oil. I removed the shocks and took them to a Monroe dealer. The dealer would not warranty the shocks and said to contact Monroe. Monroe has an online warranty claim form that directed me to a defunct web page. I next contacted Monroe customer service via phone and they would not warranty the shocks because they were purchased through Amazon. Amazon was then contacted and cheerfully agreed to send new shocks, in the meantime my truck sat on blocks for several days. Next time I would buy a brand other than Monroe. Amazon was the bright spot in this ordeal.Bigshrub"
2,Smell versus Package,"It smells like baby powder mixed with some type of chemical. It doesn't fit me well since I don't like those type of smells, but it may work for someone else.I think the bottle is pretty - looks like part of a ring, so at least I can use it for display."
5,Excellent description of historical and social aspects of an environmental cleanup,"The author provided an excellent description and analysis of the historical and social aspects of the remediation of mine wastes around Leadville, Colorado. She spent time living in Leadville, and gained access to the town's feelings about the cleanup, but also maintained distance appropriate for a journalistic treatment of the people involved. The telling of the story focuses on the people involved, not just the technical aspects of the remediation, which makes it interesting and much more relevant to understanding the challenges of environmental remediation projects."
4,Leadville,"This book crossed my path a couple of times. I have a belief, that when something crosses your path or presents itself three times or more in life, you must check it out. You can dive into it, or toss it aside. But, you must look into it. When Gillian walked into my place of business, that was the third time. Her and I traded services, and as I suspected, I was not disappointed. This book is very well written and informative. Upon reading it, you learn so much more about mining, the land and the culture of the area. For a few years, I lived in that area, and I found it to be a fascinating and informative read.Russ"
3,Literary Impressionism Leaves Something to be Desired...,"Conrad's mundane tale of the human condition is an example of literary impressionism at it's most infuriating peak. The author consciously avoids the statement of fact, only hinting at events that transpire. It requires a great deal of focus to read and leaves one feeling unsatisfied, as nothing is told, outright, to the reader. It's also a very difficult book to be tested on; the ""tale within a tale"" format makes it tough to comprehend who is actually narrating."
4,How to build and strengthen relationships through Christian principles,"Written by the prolific author of books about human relationships and time management (The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People), this book uses Biblical principles to formulate a program to build and strengthen human relationships. Although the text makes frequent reference to religious scripture (e.g. the Bible), those references only work as illustrations of the principles presented. The principles presented in this book can be useful to anyone, regardless of religious affiliation."
3,Latin Fusion Belly Dance,"This cd is exactly what it claims to be. In NYC there is a growing trend for combining Latin and Arabic music and dance styles. It's becomming quite popular, and some of the tracks on this album could certainly be used for fun, bouncy choreography. It's not for slow undulating type dance, but I think it could be quite useful for group numbers, and for those experimenting with Spanish Belly Dance styles."
5,Better than the regular Pull ups!!!,"I use these Night Time pullups for my 2 yr old for night and day use. They're really absorbent and not as flimsy as the daytime ones, and she has not had an accident yet.(BIG PLUS!) Not to mention she loves the princess designs and starts singing her ""princess song"" whenever she gets changed and she can get out of them all on her own which is such a big deal to her.............."
3,A useful but often irritatingly biased opera compendium,"The St. James Opera Encyclopedia offers many mid-sized essays on important operas, composers, singers and terms: it offers a fascinating read for opera fans who wish to find out more information handily about any of these subjects. Opera fans, unfortunately, are sometimes so highly partisan and rabid in their opinions that some of the essays are not as unbiased as one would like, and if you don't know much about the person or work being discussed the entries in the St. James guide can steer you in pretty strange directions. For example, one writer's extreme dislike of Kiri Te Kanawa's abilities and performances, in his entry on her would lead you to be convinced, had you never heard her before, that she were the absolute dregs of the operatic profession--you would come away from this having absolutely no idea why she was one of the preeminent international sopranos of the 1980s."
4,"Review for ""Fugitivas"" Soundtrack","You don't have to be a flamenco aficionado to appreciate this CD. It was in fact recommended to me by a music store manager in Sevilla when I first visited in 2001. The sheer emotion and drama of the music is enough to carry you along. My personal favorite is Meliveo's Dolorida, which captures the mood of the word ""fugitive"" through its percussion, clapping, and haunting vocals. The album was also my introduction to Nina Pastori, Chonchi Heredia, and Chano Lobato, whom I enjoyed immensely. There are pop and jazz flavors mixed into this album as well, but on the whole if you like moorish sound, the spanish guitar, and intense rhythms, you will like this CD."
4,High Praise,"Works as advertised. Drove 15V through it without ill-effects. It does make an easily audible ""click"" on actuation. Not for stealth applications."
1,relays,I got the product but it did not work. I am waiting for the supplier to send me a replacement which I have not got yet.
4,awesome remote,"Simple installation and simple use. This is now my wireless ignition switch for my car. No complaints, installed for more than a month now."
3,It seems to work ok,I am using this product on my garage alarm system. It is an older 12v bell alarm that mounts on the outside of the garage. I got tired of going outside every time to activate or deactivate the alarm so i though i would give this a try. The range is great when turning it on or off when the alarm is not sounding or drawing much voltage. But once the alarm goes off and starts pulling current then the remote becomes useless for turning it off. I have to hold the remote right up to the antenna for it to work and shut off the alarm. There must not be enough volts left when the alarm is going off for the relay to receive a strong enough signal to turn off. In other words this product does not work well for 12v electronics that draw more current such as alarm systems. It probably works better with the smaller 12v stuff.
5,Remote Control for fog lights,"I installed this relay to my car fog lights. It does work well, weather I turn the lights on or off from a distance,(I tried from around 70 feet) or from the inside of the car. It is great that remote controller has one button for on and the other for off function and a little red light that shows when is pressed on.Great product.Sandy from New Haven, CT"
5,Great Product *****,"The Logisys RM02 is a wonder ""toy"". I have had it for 3 weeks and no complaints It should also be called 'Everything Remote control' It made my scratch ideas a reality. I coupled the RM02 to a SP ST Relay switch and I hooked up my computer to my car amplifier and sub-woofer. I can now control my sub-woofer from across the room 10ft away. I'll be buying one for my car and I might need the Logisys RM04 for future accessories in my car! I highly recommend it for the DIY electronics expert."
4,I like it,Really like the game was very good to play I really like it I like the sound effects its was cool
1,Buy the new version instead!,"I was trying to save money over the newest version, but boy did I pay for it. The rows don't run parallel to each other (they're sort of hexagon shaped), and the numbers are tiny and the same color as the plastic making them nearly impossible to see. I gave up and got rid of it. This will completely frustrate you and your child...games are supposed to be fun."
4,The Misunderstood Scholarship,"For the most part, Professor Marsden's book has been significantly understood. Marsden is not answering the question of what is ""Christian Scholarship"" but rather, should there be Christian scholarship? To this latter question, Marsden answers with an unequivocable 'yes.' For the most part, his thesis, however, has been attacked as to not answering the former question. What exactly is Christian Scholarship? This book stands, not as an explanation for what it is, but a call for further scholarship. The merit of any book is what comes from it. We will only be able to judge Marsden's Outrageous Scholarship in what happens next. Can evangelical scholars define what Christian Scholarship is? If so, then Marsden's book will become a tour de force in all fields of scholarship."
3,History of Christian Scholarship,This book was excellent; very on point from my experience in college and subsequent. Motivated me to buy 4 further books by author (had one from early 1970s) and nave greatly appreciate his scholarly research of the historical perspective of American Fundamentalism.
2,Transfer does NOT do justice to the exquisite photography and compositions.,"I'm not going to talk about this film's [grand] quality per se. Just want to let everyone know that the astounding, painterly photography of this film isn't rendered correctly by DVD standards because of a VERY noticeable motion blur problem in the transfer.I know a little motion blur is to be expected in DVD and that in some TVs is more noticeable than in others, but this DVD goes beyond the acceptable norm.Some of the most beautiful sequences (like the motorcycle trip) do suffer a lot from this, sadly.Please, be warned about this."
4,Confused,"Where does anyone get the idea that the main character was a film maker? Granted the ""plot"" was a little confusing, but unless something was lost in translation, it never indicates that he is a film maker. For one small thing, he never films anything and only takes a few photos. Doesn't it lean more toward him working for some undefined ""telecommunications company"" involved in the construction of the tower? Even the offical review seems to get this point wrong.Fine acting by the supporting cast. I find it hard to beleive that they were actors at all."
3,Pretty good Christmas tale..........,I dont want to sound like a grinch but I found When Angels Sing to be a ho-hum book. Oh it had its moments but overall it was an average story that probably has been done a million times in movies and series like Little House on the Prairie. I did like its theme of families together through thick and thin. I do recommend the book but I dont want other readers going into it like I did expecting a great little story but getting an average tale. It is still a good book but I just dont see it as a classic. Sorry........
3,Corelle has changed their dish sizes.,"I purchased the Mediterrano 20-piece set because I liked the way it looked on the WWW. However, when it arrived it was nice, BUT the dish sizes are much smaller then Corelle's earlier editions. I was a little disappointed. I gave away the cups and saucers (they were too small for me). Very disappointed with the salad plates. They were so small they look like a tea cup saucer. Miss Lee, NYC."
1,Not nearly as good as the one that comes with the phone,"I got this battery a few months ago and it's already wearing out. As a Lithium Ion battery, it's (IMO) supposed to last for a certain number of ""full charges"", not build up a memory when I charge it even though it's only half discharged. But this battery either builds up a memory or lasts for a ridiculously small number of full charges. After using it for a few months, it now lasts barely 36 hours on standby on a full charge. If I use it at all, it must be recharged every night. This is very poor compared to the battery that came with my phone."
3,I am not sure why it is called Power Yoga...,"I like this dvd overall but I do feel that it is too short. When I take the yoga class at the gym it is at least an hour long. The stretches feel pretty nice after a long, stressful day."
1,Crescent Wrench,I own several Crescent wrenches of larger sizes. However I'm not impressed with there smaller wrenches have very soft jaws. They must not heat treat their smaller wrenches any more in an attempt to save money. To bad they're decided to compromise the quality of the wrench instead of increasing the price.
5,Better than expected,Very heavy and sturdy frame. Is great for my 10 year old. I'm sure he will be able to use it for years to come.
1,Chair Design is Flawed!,"Bought this chair a few months ago and it was holding up well. Until one day and when I was sitting in the chair it just collapsed, sending me onto the floor. When I looked behind both bolts in the back had broken off. Now I don't weight all that much, I'm around 180. Logo Inc. needs to get stronger bolts or else this chair should only be used by kids with low weights."
4,"really handy, just not big enough for the hand!","This is my second leash of this model; my first one wore out after 7 years (inner spring failed). My sole complaint about this model is that it is a bit too small to fit my hand in comfortably all the time, and I have small hands. In the winter, I can only get a couple of fingers through when wearing any gloves.Nevertheless, for walking my 16-lb. Peke at the same time as my 60-lb. Chow Chow, it's ideal. It gives room for each dog to keep its own pace, but doesn't let my Peke get so far away that I can't rein him in when he gets too feisty with other dogs. The tape is far less likely to burn skin (cord Flexis have scarred me more than once, and more often they belong to others!) and if the mechanism on the last one failed after 7 years of 3-4 walks/day, then I'd say it held up well."
1,Broken after two uses on a 16 lb dog.,"I purchased this brand of retractable leash thinking that it was a quality product, especially after seeing the very poor reviews that other retractable leash brands received. Unfortunately, I only managed to get two days of use out of it, two walks with my 16 lb dog and the belt frayed and nearly tore in half. Very disappointing."
5,Best Retractable Leash EVER!!,"This is by far the best quality retractable you can find anywhere.It is a truly quality product in every way! As a compulsive dog owner,I've tried different retractables. I'll never buy any other brands nowthat I've had a couple of Flexis!!!"
4,Safety First,All belt leashes are THE way to go. Much safer than the corded leashes. I encourage all dog owners to use all belt leashes. Flexi Retractable has been a great leash for our small (bichon) dog.
5,Very good quality product,All I can say is I'm satisfied with this leash. Exactly what I was looking for. The belt is strong and retracts smoothly.The whole appearance of it is sturdy.
3,Not Real Durable,"Smooth operation, but any kind of strong pulling from the dog or minor chewing results in a snapped leash. A little more durable leash material is needed."
5,love these all-belt leashes,I purchased this leash after a similar leash broke after 9 years of use. It is as great as the old one was. Safer alternative to cord retractable leash.
2,"Great, until it broke","I haven't tested this against the corded version, but in concept replacing cord with tape makes sense. However, this snapped after less than 5 months of ownership, during which it was used solely (and infrequently) with an 8 pound dog."
5,love this!,"Have a 95 lb cane corso pit, lease works perfect. I like the classic(has wider web) large with optional bag."
3,Does not lock,"If you are walking a dog that walks faster than you, the only way to stop the leash from going out further is to hold the button down or grab the belt part. All the previous ones I had purchased the lock worked, this one not at all. And there is no indication that it is not on the leash anymore. Expensive leash that does not last long before knots appear and you have to manually stop your dog or hold the button down to stop the leash from extending."
1,Dog fell off Gorge because this broke!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH!!!! PLEASE.This past weekend we were camping at a State Park. We were walking the Upper gorge trail when our 18 month old puppy spotted a chipmunk. We hit the button and the leash snapped at the nylon 1"" above the collar connection. The puppy feel 200 feet straight off the gorge and another 12 feet when he bounced over the lower trail into the river. Amazingly I can say he survived after many rescue efforts and surgery at Cornell.BEWARE OF THIS LEASH. COMPANY HAS NOT EVEN CONTACTED ME!!!!!"
4,Entertaining,"It was a cute a mindless read, perfect for the beach. The characters were fun. Made me wish I had a sister."
5,Wonderfully entertaining and true to life,"I adored this book. I had recently read ""What Alice Forgot"" and I wanted to read something by the same author. The book starts out with a set of triplet sister's birthday party. You immediately become engrossed in the lives of Cat, Gemma and Lynn. I was laughing out loud during parts of the book, and in other sections, I would cry. I think that book is an wonderful portrayal of sisters, and how they interact with each out, fight with each other, support each other, and love each other. I can't wait to get my hands on Liane Moriarty's next book."
4,Love Liane Moriarty!,"Liane Moriarty is one of my favorite authors, and this book did not disappoint. It certainly is an enjoyable read. As usual, her character development is wonderful, full of humor and strong female personalities. I loved the idea of the story revolving around the triplet girls. Occasionally throughout the book Ms. Moriarty would add an outside observer's impression of the girls upon seeing them together. I thought this was clever to have this new perspective thrown in every once in a while."
4,"Unique stories, great characters!","Although these three sisters can be as different as night and day, the bond between these triplets is unbreakable. Once again Liane Moriarty has come up with a unique story and characters that seem so real that after you finish the book you find yourself wondering what they're up to when you wake up the next day. As always Liane incorporates one dark character or issue in her books, but this time it doesn't take up as much space as others. I love Liane's dry and unexpected sense of humor and often find myself blurting out with an unexpected laugh which can be embarrassing if I'm reading in a coffee shop or if I'm in a room with my kids who already think I'm a little strange. I absolutely cannot wait for her next book to come out!"
3,so-so,"Light summer read some interesting twists fun, a little thought provoking but not too much and not over the top."
4,"A fun read, might be a good movie someday!","As a mother of multiples myself I really enjoyed reading the antics of triplets, two of which are twins and look alike, think alike, even as adults! Sprinkled in the story are vignettes of outsiders describing their impressions of the triplets throughout their lives. Its a fun, fast read. And I could imagine this story being turned into a rolicking film, much like characters in Something Borrowed. I'd like to read more from this author."
4,Adam always makes things straightforward and simple,"As always, he keeps its straightforward and simple...great beginner's primer to get you started with iPhoto. The irony is Apple should make free of charge a pdf manual .....By the way, if you buy this book you can download a pdf copy from Adam free of charge.....and if you email him with questions, he's usually pretty good at responding!"
1,These Waters Certainly are Troubled,"This is an absolutely dreadful book: completely disorganized, with not much of a story to it, and an ending that doesn't make sense."
5,Truly a page turner!,Dr. Thompson at her best! Every reader will be able to relate to the characters in some way. It is well written and is truly a page turner! This is a must read!
4,Shaun White - Don't Look Down,"This was a present for my daughter who is a real snowboarding fan. We watched it together and both thought is was very entertaining. I had thought it would be a lot of snowboarding footage but it is more about his life.It contains a lot of behind the scenes material of Shaun as he prepares and competes in several events. It also contains quite a bit of personal commentary by Shaun as well as a look at his every day life outside his home. The video finishes with footage of his entry into the skateboarding arena.It's well done, both audio and video are good. A good purchase that I would recommend for anyone who is a fan of Shaun."
2,Lame Diary,"This is great if you are a Tween and care about who Shaun White is, or if you like psychoanalyzing. Footage of riding is sparce"
3,Repurchase,"I have owned it in the past, and sadly, sold it....bought it to get back into the subject of life in the Medieval era."
1,Not what you expected at all,"The native resolution of this frame is 480x234. But the 16-page user's guide never mention how you should crop your photo. I tried so many combinations: 480x234, 480x319 etc... but none of them displayed right on the frame. The picture either stretched or has a black bar. The manual is NOT helpful at all. Having pictures displayed full screen without distortion - does this sound like a over-demand? I don't need the mp3 and video playback. BTW mp3 is OK but it can't play the video file taken by my Canon SD300. Besides, the picture looks much darker than that in computer and you have to adjust the brightness to the MAX to get a barely acceptable result. However I can't work out the picture distortion problem after 1 hour of picture cutting. I will return it, and try another major bandname. This one is really poorly packaged."
1,Do not buy,"Not good quality for showing pictures. Tried to resize the pictures, change the pixels....., but no matter what, the pics did not show good at all."
2,Return it!,"Although I don't have the same complaints as many others regarding the quality of the pictures, my issue is with the amount of time it takes to turn this thing on. No less than 18 minutes from the time we hit 'power' on the remote until the display turns on. This just can't be right. I'm taking it back tomorrow."
1,sucks sooo bad,"it is so horrible,cheap and junky. i gave it as a gift and they gave it back. waste of money."
2,first time buyer,"When I first purchased this photo frame, I was not paying attention to the screen resolution. The resolution on this screen is not near as good as I thought it would be. I really needed to get one with much better screen quality. It's not bad for the price, but I would have paid a bit more for better quality."
3,Erasable markers,They work. They are fun. They have some special needs. The purple leaves a ghost image. They must be stored laying on their side. They don't work if they are stored upright.
3,See the quality start to slide. . .,"Sad to say that the show could not keep up the sharp, smart sparks from Season 1. RHODA made one huge mistake in season one: getting her married so soon, so fast. Why?? Was it the network? the producers?? Harper herself? The ratings held up for Season 2 but CBS/producers felt that viewers wanted Rhoda single, not Rhoda married, so the season is bittersweet in that poor Joe does not last much in Season 3. I wish the wedding took place in Season 2 and perhaps a baby in Season 4. Can you imagine Ida as a grandma? There was much potential in the show in re to the themes that could have been discussed--being a stepmother, being a wife and wanting a career in the 1970s in NYC, et al., but instead the scripts in Season 2 were very generic and could have been used in any other show at the time. The pluses are the strong cast and guest spots, including one of the last bits by the great Vivian Vance."
4,Great show but it has the worst theme song in history!!!,I remember this show from the Seventies! It's fun to watch with lots of laughs. The theme song is the most annoying I've ever heard though. I have to mute it or it's stuck in my head for a week. It makes the Green Acres theme sound like Mozart.
4,Superior lightweight platform with one exception,"I bought this laptop platform for 3 reasons: light weight, simple tilt mechanism (little plastic legs that fold out) and, most important for me, a fold-out mouse stand. Unfortunately, the mouse stand has no rim, so it slides right off the smooth plastic surface whenever it's not being held. Very annoying. Solution? I bought a package ($2 plus a few cents) of Rubber Foam Weatherseal, 3/8"" wide; 3/16"" thick and ten feet long, one surface of which is sticky. I just cut off enough to press along the bottom half of the rim and, voila! Mouse stays put."
5,Exceptionally descriptive,Don't have the luxury of taking kids to a symphony? This book is the best choice for introducing kids to classical music and will give them graphic insight into the joy of an evening with an orchestra. The conductor's role is even explained and each orchestra instrument is clearly identified (without skewing all the attention to strings). The author's descriptions of the sounds from each instrument are delightfully descriptive. The focus floats from timpani to woodwinds and brass. Don't take a kid to a concert hall without reading this book to 'em first.
3,A fun book that introduces instruments to your child,My daughters really like this book. They love the different animals and instruments. I love the words and descriptions they use while talking about what each instrument does and sounds like. I only wish they had a cassette tape that went along with it to introduce the sounds of the instruments as well.
1,Inexcusable,"I bought this book to read to my little grandson. Being a professional trombonist, I was shocked to find that there is absolutely no mention of the trombone. This is inexcusable--do not buy this book if you want a comprehensive book about the symphony orchestra."
2,Maybe I'm being too picky,"I don't have any children, so maybe I'm being too picky with this book but I felt the string section was covered nicely. The Violin, Viola, Cello, and string bass all were discussed. When it came to woodwinds, flute, piccolo, oboe, bassoon, clarinet, and bass clarinet were all shown (they seem to have forgotten saxophone may be more common than oboe.) . The brass section was empty only showcasing French Horn, Trumpet, and Tuba...leaving out euphonium or baritone, cornet, trombone. Basically that brings me to me to my point, the brass section of the book was bad..."
3,A slightly diminished orchestra,"Nice warm drawings (though a little stilted, as another reviewer has noted.) The ""descriptions"" of the instruments - how they sound and what they evoke - are OK, I guess. But I have to point out a significant omission: the trombones! Not only are they one of the funnier-looking instruments, but indispensible in the brass section as well. It would be very embarassing to have to explain their absence to an alert child - I'd avoid the book on that account."
3,Animal Orchestra,Disappointing in that the author/illustrator has used animals as the players in the orchestra. There was no need for anthropomorphism. But the text that goes with the well-dran instruments is very good.
2,"better than most, but could be better","Meet the Orchestra introduces each instrument, unfortunately it also introduces stereotypes of musicians as well. Not all children want to read it because the illustrations are harsh. Descriptions are short and lifeless."
5,Great Book,I really like the pictures and descriptions in this book! I know my students will like it and will be able to learn from it!
3,unfortunate grammar,"I am a music teacher and at first reading I was very impressed until I reached the page where the book stated that the musicians were ""coming on the stage"" instead of ""coming onto the stage"". This error is grave enough that I decided not to buy multiple copies as student incentives. Defacing books is generally a bad idea, but I plan to cross out and write over the offending error before giving it to my nephew."
2,Consumer/Customer Be Ware - The Product Listed and the one your purchase may not be the one receive...,"Amazon and their supporting Businesses, ABC Wholesale and AmericaRx, are misrepresenting this product.1. It no longer contains Acetaminophen and now contains Aspirin.2. You may order one version of Alka-Seltzer Plus in one flavor and get a different variant in another flavor.Unacceptable, Amazon please clean up your illegal representation."
4,Mello's goes out with a bang for his last album,"This unfortunately will probably be the last album by Big Mello seeing as he died in a car crash. This album is his best work since Southside Story. I felt that The Gift wasn't as good as his other releases but he comes back with a vengeance on this release. Songs like Hey You, Just Sex and Slow Your Role really help pull this album together. If your hesitant to buy this release don't be. You won't be disspointed with this."
4,Good UNTIL you reach the last drops.,"Basically, this popcorn is really good. You open it and it's excellent. You eat a whole huge bag in 15 minutes or so (or I do). Unpopped kernels always below 1%. But what I've been noticing in more recent bags is that the seasoning has been in excess. It's a whole bunch on more than a few popcorns and overall just more. Shaking it doesn't really help to distribute. The first 45% or so of the popcorn is great, as it was before. I've been throwing away the last bit of the popcorn. I want seasoning on popcorn; not popcorn on seasoning!!Usually, though, this popcorn is 100% crazy good. If anything, you would almost buy it for the not-so-seasoned top."
1,Oogie' popcorn,I keep my office staff and family happy with popcorn being available to them for snacks. This popcorn caused a mutiny of my family and staff. This is without a doubt some really awful stuff. I will never buy this again.
3,Decent,Pros- thin and paintable.- easy to installCons- does not create a good seal. You need caulk.- visible spring is not very attractive.- could be slightly bigger
1,It's not 8 inches wide,"Though it says 'Width 8 inches' and 'Easy To Mount Over Any 16'' x 8'' Foundation Vent', the cover is only 7 3/8 inches wide (outside measurement), so it will not cover a vent with an 8-inch opening; most foundation vents have an opening wider than 7 3/8, so the cover is completely useless. I had to return them all. If the opening on your vents is more like 7 inches, go ahead and order them, but be sure to measure."
5,Foundation Vents Covers,"I was glad to find these vent covers at Amazon, I had looked for them at every other place I could thank of, no one had them, thank you LI Building Products. They worked just fine. Thanks"
3,Purchase Review,"The item was delivered as promised, with respect to date. However, this is not the book that I wanted for the class. Nevertheless, I don't blame the seller, the picture of the book was available for me to review to make sure that it was what I wanted.The issue was that, the Portland Cement Association, Published another book with the same title and Author. The book that I purchased from Amazon has 71 pages; it is a 3rd edition. While the book that I bought at the school bookstore has 444 pages; it is a 15th edition."
2,Very thin in information.,"I bought this ""book"" to use it as a reference for my PE exam. It was a big disappointment.First, It is very thin. It's really a pamphlet not a book. No graphics, hard to read, overall it's not well redacted or put together and very expensive!!. I would definitively skip this one and go with a concrete design or materials book. Thumbs down."
3,A little too orange looking!,Nice silver but stone too orange! I was looking for more red like the picture!Item is very pretty and I gave this to a friend as a gift and she loved them!
3,Nothing spectacular,"It has no country of origin so who made it? and its kind of cheesy in the quality department. It does work but I would not expect a long life as the warning light gets pretty warm, all in all I would not recommend it for the price."
5,Must-read,"As the author of ""Catfish Like a Pro"" I know a little something about catfish, but Keith Sutton knows so much about catfish that they often ask HIM when it's time to spawn and where they should feed. He's so attached to catfish that it's become the first part of his name. This is a great book, and if you're serious about catching cats this is a must-read. More than any other species, this is the fish Sutton has the most expertise for in finding and catching."
3,Good General information,Lots of color photos.Not quite as good as the North American Fishing club books on catfishing...but a worthwile addition for the catfish angler.Al A Richmond Va.
3,Good Florida movie for its time.,This movie was filmed in the 70's and has alot of great footage of the Florida everglades. Plot was weak but it was just enjoyable to watch all the wildlife that is the everglades and to see how the Seminoles made a living before they were able to build casinos.
3,Okay movie for juvenile audiences,Joe Panther is a young Seminole Indian living in Florida who is striving to establish a role for himself in the (white man's )world .he feels an outcast in that world .He gets work on a charter fishing boat run by Captain Harper (Brian Keith )but otherwise is drifting until he discovers a talent for professional alligator wrestling (the movie was retitle Alligator Joe in Germany).There is a sub-plot involving illegal alien smuggling but the main thrust is to do with Joe discovering his true metierActing is fine -not earth shattering but perfectly proficient -and ther is nice location photography of the Florida oceans and hinterland .The music during the alligator wrestling scenes is so reminiscent of Jaws it surely cannot be accidentalThe main audience will probably be the early teens and immediate pre-teens and it serves the group well without ever becoming really exceptional
5,The Greatest Book in the World!,"The Legend of the Wandering King, by Laura Gallego Garcia, is a great story that is set in Arabia in the past. Walid ibn Hujr is the main character and he is a king that is bad tempered and seeks vengeance against Hakim whole stole the king's carpet which contained the entire history and future of the human race. The king meets a beautiful girl named Zahrah who is the daughter of a sheik and she is a bandit. She also helps Walid on his journey in the desert. The message I got from the story is that you should follow your dreams and don't quit. I liked the story because it is filled with suspense, mystery, action, love and it also has a sadness about it. Many things about it will keep you captivated by this story."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old, who love MLP and have seen all of the recent movies. I have to say I am unhappy with the revamping of this favorite. This movie does not have the same quality as the rpevious movies! Along with a new too cutesie look these ponies are also sporting new (and not so great) attitudes. Instead of the adorable, sweet, caring, and loving friends that we know and love these ponies show jealousy, greed, envy, they fight, stick their tongues out at each other, sneak around to cover up a mistake, and lie. The redemption and moral that you might expect never really comes as they quickly wrap it up by tossing out a few quick and not heartfelt apologies. I was hugely upset with this movie and will probably get rid of it as soon as possible. I'll stick with our favorite loveable ponies!"
4,My Little Pony Twinkle Wish Adventure,My three year old daughter loved recieving this movie she watches this one and the other two i purchased on here too. thank you so much.
3,"OK, nothing more","Our (my 4 year old daughter and I) first My Little Pony movie was nothing special at all. I find the Strawberry Shortcake movies to be far superior. Still, my daughter has the pony action figures, so she thought it was neat to see them running around. Medicore all around...animation, voice, music, plot. I don't know if all the pony movies are this bland....but I hope not!"
5,Great CD/DVD printer,"I have been using a Primera printer now for over 5 years and it always performs admirably,The resolution of fine print, colour and detail is excellent. A great buy if you have lots of DVD's or CD's to print directly onto disc.The print cartridges are quite expensive and cannot be purchased at your local stationery supplier or refilled, but generally speaking they last quite a long time."
3,Just works!! Nothing great.,"This product will do your job, but it doesn't have the quality. Anyways, its a lot cheaper than the other Samsonite alternatives, and you don't really need superb quality for such a simple job anyway."
5,Happy Happy Happy!,"Man, this book was hillarious! A deffinate must-buy for fans of books like ""Love Hina"" and uh... *cant think of anything else* Well, I liked it anyways, and you will too! Yay happy!"
4,"Really cute doll, nasty hair.","This doll has really cute clothes and accessories, but the hair is awful! You can't even comb it.Wasn't that supposed to be half of the fun considering they come with all of the hair accessories. Come on, a company like Mattel should be able to do better than that! All said, it is a fun doll with cool clothes."
2,Not what I expected--look carefully,"I was looking for a book that explained custom tag libraries in more depth and provided several rich examples. I thought this was the ticket and was convinced based on other reviews. Two things really disappointed me: 1) at least half the book is a reference of Apache and Sun's JSP library--not what I need; 2) of the remaing half off the book, fewer than 90 pages talk about custom tags (the rest is background material). So in a nutshell what I got was a 90 page book which didn't seem to explain things more than other books that I already had. With hind-sight 20:20, I should have just stuck with my ""Java Server Pages"" book by Fields/Kolb."
3,Mastering JSP Tags?,This book does cover a lot of ground. You will probably learn about JSP custom tags and tag libraries if you can get through all the typos and errors in the example code. I think this book does a good job of covering the mechanics of JSP Tags. I don't think it covers the design aspects of using tags very well. I would have rated it higher if someone had bothered to proofread this book.
2,JSTL coverage premature,"This book's coverage of JSTL is not useful. JSTL was not yet released when this book was published, so it covers a premature beta version that isn't useful to learn."
5,Worth the Wait,"Wow! I've been waiting for this book for months, and it really delivers. Most complete and up-to-date coverage of the tag libraries I've found, plus I especially liked Goodwill's coverage of how to create custom tags--the sample code is really helpful. (I've already tested some of them and am impressed at the results.) Overall, a great job."
1,Be careful !!!,There're over 100 typos !!!!!!!!I cannot show the typos here becuase there're many many many mistakes. I don't know why other reviewers don't mention it.Maybe It's a disadvantage of the author so that Amazon doesn't let the review show up.I totally don't recommend to buy this book.You can buy this book after you manster taglibs with other books. :)
1,I can't believe 2nd grade kids were given this book to read,"I received several copies of this book from a public school which had stamped them ""obsolete"". I thought it was a great find -- free textbooks! I soon realized that not only was this book too dumbed down for my 1st grader (I homeschool), it was too dumbed down for my 4 year old.For instance, I just flipped the book open and find, ""You can see shapes. You can feel shapes. You can use shapes. Shapes help you learn. What shapes do you see in the picture?"" That is an entire page of this ""textbook"" -- the entire book is written at that level.It might be a really good tool to use with a 3 year old. It is not something I would ever insult a 2nd grader with. I cannot stretch my imagination to the extent of understanding how any teacher of 7 year old children could find this book useful at all.My advice is to skip this one, unless you're looking for a really good reason to doubt the sense of textbook publishers and public schools."
1,SOOOO Disappointing,"As an avid Flight-Sim player, I was initially excited about purchasing this game. However, I was plagued by program crash after program crash after installing this game to my PC. No matter the type of PC I used, XP or higher, this game would not work. I even found this game at Swap meet for $5 and ran into the exact same issue. So, I would not recommend this game at all. However, if you are looking for a good Combat Flight Sim by EA, I would recommend USAF instead."
4,My go to Irish Cook book,I use this book a decent amount. I've had for a few years now I continue to find new ideas.
4,Inside Saddam's Reign of Terror.,"I watched this with my husband, and still can not and never will understand why these things continue to happen, and why the world lets it happen again and again and again. When will we ever put aside our differences and just make the most of the short time we have on this earth."
2,Well...,It doesn't turn my finger green. Some days the gem looks really fake. But some days it doesn't. Maybe it's a humidity thing.
3,Average. Still not pleased.,"I was pleased on the date of shipping and how it was shipped. It arrived in the standard UPS box with a heart shaped gift box to hold the ring. Shortly after giving the ring to my girlfriend, the ring started turning her finger green. I guess you get what you pay for, eh? Still pleased with the ring and the price. 3 stars."
5,Sterling Silver Round Shaped 5mm Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Polished Finish 3mm Wide Band Promise Ring Size 6,"the ring arrived two days after it was supposed to arrive, but the ring is in excellent condition and it comes with a little cute blue jewellery box.i ordered a size 6, and it fits my finger perfectly. i love it. definitely will buy more stuff from Gem Avenue.recommend to everyone!"
5,Great ring,"I bought this for my girlfriend and it was great. She definitely loved it. I picked it out cause it was a nice simple ring. The stone on it really sparkled, so it was a perfect promise ring."
2,on the first day,The very first time I put the ring on the stone fell out. Ever since I super glued it back in the ring has looked great.
5,Very Pleased!,"My fifteen year old daughter chose this ring herself and I approved it based on it's reviews and the customer ratings of the company, Gem Avenue. It is a lovely fluid band of marked sterling silver with a moderate size cz that is maybe 3/4 carat but set down in an unobtrusive fashion like a channel set. The cz is clear and catches the light with faint sparkles of color at the right angle. It has been worn it for about a week and it still appears new. My daughter absolutely loves it and it does not look out of place on her finger. I find the ring to be dainty but not flimsy, and it was shipped very quickly in a darling, tiny gift box that my daughter was also thrilled with. Add all this together with the VERY reasonable price and I'd say we have a very happy customer."
4,Beautiful item,"As silly as it may sound, I got this ring because I was sick of guys hitting on me at work, and I needed something to show them that says, ""See, I'm in a relationship! Now back off!"" From the reviews I expected something good, but when I got it in the mail this morning I was really happily surprised. I got compliments all day at work and people kept asking if it was real. The best things about this ring are that it's low profile so it doesn't get stuck on everything, it is comfortable to wear, and it looks real! Only con is that I ordered a size five, I'm always a size 5, and it was just a bit too small. But that's easy enough to get fixed.So all in all, I love the ring, and I suggest it to anyone."
5,My present from my bf(:,"I just got this item today and I like it. I liked the look of it and its very cute. The price is very reasonable as well. My bf bought me this when i saw it. Originally he wanted to get me a more expensive promise ring but i told him not to spend that kind of money. And then i saw this ring. At first, my bf didn't like it because of the price. He told me that he wanted to get me a nice ring, that I can always wear it and it will always stay the same. But when the ring arrived, he changed his mind. He told me whatever would look good on me. This is a really nice ring. And i thank my bf for buying it for me. Overall, I think its a really great item and the price is reasonable.(:"
3,ummm!,I am not sure what to say. all the reveiws that i read said that it was a wonderful product! not so much! I am not so impressed. I wore the ring once and it turned my finger green. When i got it I was a little disapointed.. just looking at it I new it was not real. which sucks.I was not impressed at all. i dont think i would tell any one to buy it.g.poundstones wife.
4,Great Ring,"This ring is fantastic, espessialy for its price! It looks beutiful, feels sturdy, and the diamond looks gorgious! The only flaw i noticed was that it was blemished in certain areas under the light. But from a casual distance, you could pull this off as a wedding band if your super short on cash. Great Ring, would definatly recomend it!"
2,an ok ring for the price,"After reading previous reviews, I bought this ring, but I'm a bit disappointed as it doesn't have the quality I needed. There are visible scratch marks on the ring. It is however not too bad for its price."
3,fooled by the title,"I guess I hadn't realized when I purchased this that the work was all from one artist (and one whose work is not particularly appealing to me). The title made me think that it was a compilation of different artists, so, shame on me...anyway, if you like this artist, and there are many reasons to like him, then you will enjoy this collection. his imagination is great and his stories run a wide gamut of themes. the most enjoyment for me comes in watching what looks to be Southern California locales become populated with men and women speaking with British dialects."
3,fine but not what i wanted,This was fine but not what i was looking for. If you like comic strips that was fine.
2,Amateurish.... NOT recommended,"I was disappointed by this book. I have all the ""Meatmen"" series of erotic art and was expecting this work to be on the same high level. It's not, not at all. The drawings are almost ""cartoonish"", not at all realistic or erotic. The Meatmen collection is high quality, very erotic and imaginative work. This stuff looks like it was drawn by a guy with a dirty mind who can't draw very well. Not recommended."
5,Please to add this to my collection.,"I enjoy this light love story between a teacher and his student immensely though its plot is not as deep as Lies&Kisses (one of my top favorites). I love this mangaka's artwork and the translation is decent. So far, Drama Queen's effort is commendable; surfing their website there are more in the near horizon to satisfy us Yaoi fan."
5,The best of the WC series,"This is the best one of the series with political intrigue mixed with plenty of action. It's cool how it sheds light of Tolwyn's plot in relation to another secret group, and the whole novel had an underlying tension that sets the rest of the book off."
5,Tanz der Vampire - Polish casy,I just love hesring musicals in different languages. here's to another great recording. Does anyone knowof a recording in English?
4,"Nice set of dishes, however...","I love these dishes, just got them and they are exactly the type I wanted. I was nervous about the design at first, but I really like it. The mugs are stonewear, but I don't think thats a bad thing. The only negative thing is that it doesn't come with salad plates, they are bread plates. I didn't notice in the picture how small the plates were compared to the dinner plates- definitely would have bought a different set had I known."
3,"Good basic info, not well written","This book contains good basic information and practical advice, though it is lacking in-depth explanations. So if you are fine with taking this author's advice at face value without scientific explanations, this book may be useful to you. However, I do not think it is very well-written; perhaps the researcher should have hired a real writer to edit his manuscript. I recommend Anti-cancer: A New Way of Life, by David Serban-Schreiber, instead. This book contains most of the same recommendations, with some additional updates from more recent research, and it is a MUCH better read."
2,Goal II DVD review,"The product I received from Classic Video didn't meet my expectations, BUT Classic Video did give me a full refund and I just received it. So, I'm happy to say I was happy with my transaction with them."
2,Not Living the Dream!,"After seeing Goal I, bought and watched II with my 10 year old grandson. (I should say partially watched). Sensuality and heavy drinking more like watching a soap opera. Disappointing!! If a Goal III comes out, I won't waste my money! So nice if it could have had a more family friendly clean storey line - and more SOCCER!"
1,Bad quality,When I got the DVD it was really scratched when the description said it was like new. It was really inaccurate and would not recommend buying from this seller.
2,Goal II,"Loved the first film ""Goal: the dream begins and could not understand why the sequel was not available from Netflix. Now I do: IT SUUCKS!To all soccer and Kuno enthusiasts, save your money, it is definitely NOT worth it!"
4,Great sequel,"My daughter really enjoyed the first movie. When she found out that a sequel had been released, we ordered it from Amazon. Excellent sequel that should have been release in the USA."
4,Hard-Body Yoga with Tari Rose,"I haven't tried the Power Yoga for Runners yet, but I can say that the Hard-Body Yoga video is great. This video is perfect for people who lack flexibility and/or are new to yoga. You will notice a significant improvement in muscle tone within a couple of weeks and once you memorize the moves you'll be able to do the workout on your own. It's also a great tape because she offers modifications and advanced techniques so you'll be continually challenging yourself. Criticisms: there aren't enough breathing cues and the tempo is off on some of the moves. Overall, definitely worth buying."
2,A bit rocky,"I am an artichoke, was at several points a good book, the description described to me a girl who felt under appreciated and misfiting, who finds herself in the middle of a compromiseing situation. The book did stay somewhere in that region of plot, but several events in the book were just plain poorly written. Unlike the introspective character introduced in the beginning, Sarah, evolves into a somewhat ditzy, shallow character. The protrayal of the elevatorboy, who Sarah, of course, developes eyes for (that, bringing up the point of the book being predictable), was a bit stereotypical. On a brighter side the book did deliever an accurate, colorful journaling of anorexia, and divorce."
3,interesting view on anorexia,i liked this book and lucy frank's description of emily's mother. i was dissapointed that sarah's cute guy turned out to be kind of a jerk.... i was so proud of sarah when she stood up to her parents :)
5,so comfy,"These capris are lightweight and very comfy. I recommend the shorts too! The drawstring on the inside customizes the fit. I would recommend that if you are short you may not like these. The inseam is 23"". I'm 5'9"" and the length is good."
4,Solid Reference,"This book is a very good reference. A complete walkthrough of reqs gathering, the site survey process and design considerations. Some some cheap shots at competitors and too much Cisco product promotion, but that is common in a Cisco Press book; It is just as much about promoting Cisco solutions as it is about technology education. Recommended."
4,nice casual dinnerware,I've used Corelle for many many years and I love it. This set is great (though over the years it seems like they made the plates thinner). The only drawback is the cups are not Corelle. I am still happy with it anyway.
2,not the corelle I have had before!!,"I was very disappointed in this product.I have used corelle dishes for years,loved the quality.these dihes are very,very thin.I might as well have bought plastic dishes.they have no weight to them at all.I am very disappointed in this product.will not purchase again."
3,NOT FACTORY BOXED,PRODUCT IS NICE. JUST CAN'T GIVE IT AS A GIFT. BOXED IN A PLAIN BROWN BOX. CORELLE IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL.
3,"Nice dishes, but don't believe the picture","I like these dishes, but i bought them versus another print that i already own, because 1. I thought it included medium sized plates (like the picture) but they are the small ones (which is in the description, i believe). And 2. i thought the mugs were more of a cobalt blue, but they are lighter. Oh well, i still like the set and they are nice dishes, but i was a little disappointed when i received them."
3,Bowls are not 18 oz size,"I ordered this for a friend for Christmas, the pattern is a bit muted but over all it was a good choice for her. What I am really upset about is the size of the bowls, I have an Impressions set and if you look at the specs on that it says it has the same size bowls. But they are not. I can't even pour 16 oz in these. And if it was not described as the same size as the ones I have I would not have expected it.I don't know how this will hold up because I just checked the box to make sure that nothing was broken in shipping and sealed it back up. I love my Corelle and have had it for years, I expect this will be the same."
2,I think the picture is misleading and the small plate is too small.,The small plates are much smaller that I had anticipated and therefore almost useless for anything other than a large cookie.
2,HOT - but not in a good way,"As many other reviews mentioned the salad plates are too small, the mugs are heavy, and the colors are very muted. But, my biggest problem is how hot the dishes get. Serve a soup or stew and you'll need hot pads handy.We bought these as a take-along for when we rent vacation homes and for that purpose they work ok, but I'd not be happy to use them very frequently."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this set because of the favorable reviews on this site. I was dismayed when I unpacked it by how thin, light, and flimsy the plates and the bowls were. They feel almost like plastic. Also, the bowls are too small to use for cereals, if that is what you intend to use them for."
1,Dishes arrived broken,Didn't need to open the box to realize dishes were broken. Returned and currently waiting on refund.
2,Color disappointment.,"Very disappointed when product was received. Colors were faded and bland - not at all as they looked on the site! The blue cups were not a true blue, but a faded country blue. And the perimeters of the plate design were nowhere near as brilliant as shown - very dull."
3,"I love the dishes, but the pattern is VERY dull.","The dishes are fantastic. Light weight, easy to clean, stack nicely on the shelf. Having arthritis makes weight of the dishes an issue, especially more than of them at a time.I miss the mugs that came with my mother's set. I preferred them made of the same material as the plates. The mugs can be a bit heavy, though the blue is pretty.However, the pattern on the plates is NOT as pictured. I have several sets of this and hoped I'd just get used to it, since I lost the receipt. It's very dull and faded, and the gaps between the color blocks look bigger."
2,Cups are not Corelle,"As an old customer of Corelle, & knowing the quality, I was sure that I'm receiving cups made of the same material. (not what they call stone wash)Other than that I would give it 5 stars !!!!"
2,Sounded nice... Ended differently,"Sounded like a nice set to begin with, but once it arrived, one of the coffee cups were broken (Thought they were shatterproof), and the bowls have chips on the rim. Quality control list he a thing of the past. Not too happy with this product."
4,NIce Solid Correlle,"They are traditional Corelle plates. Light, sturdy, semi break resistant, and great for every day use. The pattern on the outside is very sharp, but I have noticed some very slight degradation in the pattern only after 2-3 months of use. I would purchase it again, however."
4,love plates but need larger bowls,The plates are a good size but the bowls are small and if I drank coffee I would say the same thing about the cups -- they are small
3,One more on the color and the size,"I just bought two of these, and have to confirm that the color is much less brighter than that of the picture, and the size of the ""salad"" dish is more that of a bread dish. Other than that, I suppose it makes a good day to day dish set. Also, the packaging was quite good and sturdy; everything arrived in good condition. I wish Amazon would update their picture with one depicting real colors and size of small dish."
2,ok for the kids kind of dishes,they look alot better online than in person. they remind me of a kids tea set but in a larger version. the cups are small and a different blue than the blue on the dishes. but they are dishwasher safe and so far nothing is broken - you get what you pay for ($25).
4,Great dishes!,"I recieved these dishes as a Christmas gift, 12/08. I really like them and my kids love the colors. I should mention that the colors are not nearly as bright on the actual dishes as they are in the picture. Still, the dishes are lightweight, good sized and easy to clean. Exactly what I was looking for."
2,Salad plates?,"[[Corelle Livingware 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Memphis]]The salad plates turned out to be bread and butter plates. They were to be the most used item. They are certainly pictured wrong. The set I looked at at a retail shop had real salad plates. This is a huge disappointment and what can we do about it?"
4,"Corelle Livingware Memphis 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4",I am fully enjoying my new dinnerware. My experience with Amazon.com was both more than satisfactory and rewarding. I recieved my purchase ahead of the predicted time and fully intact. I wouldn't hesitate to shop with Amazon.com again.Sandy from WI
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $,"What a joke this book is. Buy the Fitzgerald, Zerwekh, Leik, and Collier. I passed the AANP on my first attempt, thanks to these 4 books. This Winland-Brown was a waste of $!"
1,Too many mistakes,"There are so many errors throughout this book that I fear for the less informed reader. I disagreed with most of her answers but the good thing was that it forced me to look up the information to verify that indeed I was correct and this author was WRONG! I cannot believe that this book was published and am tempted to write to the publisher. I hope the author reads all of these comments because she needs to go through her own ""book"" and look up each topic and LEARN the correct responses. Unbelievable and I too wish there were negative stars because I did not want to even give her one star."
3,Adult & Family NP Cert. Exam Review Q's,"I found the book to be helpful, although after taking the exam I thought that it was harder than the exam! The CD with questions was very helpful. There were some discrepancies between the book and the CD."
3,Thorough but discouraging,"I obtained a copy of the book from a former classmate. The sections are divided to focus on specific areas of need. The volume of practice questions in text and disk is great, BUT, I found most questions far more difficult than what was on the actual exam (in my case, I took the AANP version today). The practice questions may be very discouraging to some as I found it to be, however, try to remember that the exam may not be as indepth. Do take a review course or order review cassette tapes. I recommend the Advance Practice Education Associates (APEA) review by Amelie Hollier who is a likable, encouraging, excellent speaker who tells you what you need to know with memorable stories. Note: I am not affiliated with the company nor am I being coerced to sharing this. The Fitzgerald review course does not cover many conditions but what it does cover may be more indepth than is necessary for the exam. Good Luck to ALL!"
2,Find a different review book,"I purchased this book at my Fitzgerald review course. After getting it home and starting to use it, I quickly became frustrated. I thought that the questions were poorly worded and harder than the actual test questions. Several of the questions were coded wrong and there were too many questions that were ""all of the above"" or ""none of the above."" These are complaints that I have seen in other reviews of this book.The review book that I did find to be very helpful was ""Adult Nurse Practitioner Certification Review"" by JoAnn Zerwekh and Jo Carol Claborn. Their questions are closer to what the actual boards are like and there are no all or none questions (just like the real exam)."
3,This *could* have been great...,"At first browse, this book looks a bit like one of Julius Bendat's excellent texts on time series analysis: dense in formulas, but rewarding the wade.And then I tried to actually _work through_ their examples. A formula-rich book is NO place for typos.I don't mind when the text uses ""lossed"" for ""lost;"" I can quickly figure out what was meant. I resent having to do forensics to rebuild what formulas and/or results I should have seen in the examples.That three-star rating reflects two things: the potential this book could have had, and my expectation that sooner or later there will be an ERRATA listing that helps sort this beast out."
3,"Good Book, but a little old and not organized the best","Of all of the ghost towns books I own or have read by Phillip Varney, this is probably the worst. But that being said, this book is not that bad. It was written in 1981, so many of the sites are not there any more. It is a black and white photos, which is a drawback once you have seen his newer books. The maps are not really laid out very well. Also the chapters are a little confusing as to their organization. I think he has leaned how to write a perfect ghost town book since (his CO and AZ book are great). But the sites in the book are the best sites to see in NM, he didn't leave anything out. I have been to many of the sites and have taken fantastic pictures myself (in color and B&W). Therefore, I know how good the pictures in the book can look. But if you haven't been to any ghost towns before and you want a New Mexico ghost town book, then it is still one of the best ones out there."
3,Okay history book; not a great guide,"Now that over 30 years have passed since its original publication, it's likely that very little of what is documented in this book still remains. I also doubt the book was very helpful back in 1981. Even then, many of the ""ghost towns"" contained only a few foundations or other scant ruins, rather than any actual buildings. I didn't do a count, but it seems that half or more of the sites listed were off limits at the time of publication. The author writes about the pictures he has taken (especially of places that most other folks won't be allowed to see) and ""photogenic"" buildings, so including more photographs in the book would have been ideal. Most of the pictures that did make it into the guide are large--they would have still been ample size had they been reduced to make space for more--but a bit underexposed (dark). Overall, this is a nice little history book, but look elsewhere if you want something that is indeed a ""practical guide."""
2,flimsy,"these sheets are cheap and it seems, cheaply made. They are scratchy and very thin. Sometimes you get what you pay for..."
1,Horrific and Hackneyed,"This atrocious excuse for a novel starts out with a list of the number of ships in the fleets of the Galaxy Defenders and Empire of Conquerors, respectively. Um -- why should I care? The book is all clunky exposition and has a hackneyed plot that's nothing more than a blend of Animorphs and Star Wars.Terrible, and most certainly not worth $14 -- or even 14 cents. And I know for a fact that every single review for this book is either by the author, his aunt, his grandmother, or his mother."
1,Supercilious and Forced,"Jamming vocabulary into a book neither makes it a quality book or an interesting read, beyond this all but three posts on this book are by ""a reader"" unfortunately Bruce, ""an author"" might be a more appropriate name. Out of the remaining one coincidentally has the same last name as the author, and coincidentally comes from the same part of Virginia as he, the other positive reviewer has only posted a review on this book, which as the author claims wasn't a great seller, so a rational conclusion based on probability would be that, framart doesn't exist. So people enjoy the wonderful science fiction writings interpreted into a new but similiar plot, by a very new, inexperienced, and pretentious young writer. But being so young and ""talented"" we'll give him an O for effort, which equates to nothing, leaving him with the one star he deserves."
1,Would like my money back,"This is a publication by the American Bar Association that is little more than a compilation of articles on various subject, most of which seem outdated. Since you can find the articles for free online (and usually updated versions of the articles) this means that you are just wasting your money with this one."
3,Works Okay,"I purchased this to replace my old water heater for one of my horse troughs, and it works fine - but what brilliant engineer decided to bring the cord out of the bottom? A minor criticism ,but it never floats flat since the cord comes out of the bottom. Also, although the cord never touches the coil underneath - it is pretty close to it."
5,Great value and excellent product,I wanted to replace an old worn keyboard and this one was perfect for me.It's full size and raised keys are just what I wanted and the mouse works fine as well. Great keyboard/mouse combo at a low price!
5,A must buy for the price....,"I decided to buy this keyboard/mouse combo because it was wired. Yes Wired... I was sick of dealing with the wireless ""pain"" (batteries, frequent disconnection, etc). For my surprise, this combo was much better than what I was expecting. It's keys are pretty ""soft"" and quiet. And it includes some handy keys to access basic windows functionality (web, email, messenger, volume, etc). If you are looking for a cheap NON ""painful"" way of using your PC, this is IT."
3,"Maybe good for Office, but not Home","I loved the keyboard but the mouse is terrible. Feels cheap and the scroll wheel is not up to par. The DPI of this mouse is terrible and even with sensitivity all the way up I still can't move all the way across the screen. The keyboard is probably the best feature, the keys are very easy to type with and feel like you are typing on air, the downside is that sometimes it feels like the keys hit the bottom of the base. Hard to explain but Keyboard is pretty good all around. For the price you can't beat it but be prepared to buy another mouse if you want to feel comfortable."
4,The Election Process,"The video ""Street Fight"" provides a window from which to view the mayoral election in a city that is dealing with high levels of poverty and big business investors. The gentrification occurring within the city hides the fact that the investors are taking profits from the city and transferring it through their headquarters to the already wealthy.The incumbant is supported by the investors and also popular national figures who don't fully understand the city's problems.This city's electoral process provides a nice metaphor for larger scale elections, from state to federal level elections. It reveals what common people are concerned about, and it shows intelligence is not just a characteristic of the powerful.A fabulous movie, which will be a part of my curriculum for years to come."
4,Great,Great documentary. A must to all interested in elections and political processes. A great addition to Political Science classes.
1,Amazon search hijacked,"""Streetfight"" is a Ralph Bakshi cartoon spoof of Disney's ""Song of the South,"" from a 70's blaxploitation perspective, starring Scatman Crothers, Philip Michael Thomas and Barry White. The VHS version carried the original title, ""Coonskin.""On the other hand, perhaps a film about Cory Booker, Sharpe James and Newark politics IS classic ""blaxploitation."""
4,Writing and Developing Your College Textbook,"As an experienced textbook development editor, I think this text is an extremely valuable resource for any author who wishes to enter the college market, as well as for experienced authors who want to keep on top oftrends in the rapidly changing textbook industry. Lepionka has filled previously unserved niche of the publishing marketplace in expert fashion."
1,eep.,"Time chasers is a truly awful movie. The plot, if that is the right word, concerns a bicycle riding physics professor in Vermont named Nick, who has to pass for our hero. This guy invents a time transport as he calls it, a light plane that can travel through time. He gets involved wth Gencorp a sinister company run by J.K. Robertson, who'll have to pass for the film's villain. Nick travels into the future to prove his invention works. The future is a place where everybody rides bikes and kids dress in very bright clothes, not very futuristic at all. After selling the machine to GenCorp Nick finds that GenCorp has been using it to transport weapons. The holier than thou Nick sets off to stop GenCorp, and eventually does but not before causing most of the audience to die of boredom."
3,"One of the best movies ever MST3K, but not in the ""so bad it's good"" way","This movie was filmed on a low budget in the early 90s. It's honestly not bad enough to be a great MST3K feature. At the end of the movie, I clapped a little and said ""Given the time (of production) and budget they had, they could not have made a better movie."" That's intended as a compliment. It's not a _great_ movie by any stretch, but it would have been a solid B or B- movie at the time. The effects are terrible now; at the time they would have been passable. The plot is actually solid, makes sense, and the story has a beginning and an end. You even understand why the characters do what they do. This isn't true of most cheaply-produced movies.Worth a watch on MST3K for the plaid-on-plaid ensemble alone."
1,If you're prone to acne watch out!,I haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until I started using this cream. I kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. I went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. I went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. I didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until I started back on my neutrogena. I feel so bad about the $$$ I lost and I wish I would've gotten a sample first. I encourage you to do the same.
3,There are better options for the money,"Nothing wrong with this cord other than it's a bit heavy. Like it might not stay plugged into whatever you're powering heavy. I haven't had it fall out, but it's something I worry about. Mercury Magnetics offers this same quality cable in bright red for something like $15. I own three of those now, and one of these. Just my recommendation."
4,Recommended to all Pagans interested in the Northern Way!!,"Another of Thorsson's masterpieces! I strongly recommend this book to all pagans who follow the Northern Way. I don't quite understand the bad reviews about Edred Thorsson being a satanist, he is quite far from it!This is an excellent book for beginners of Asatru, due to the book wide variations of Norse paganism. This book covers many subjects and customs such as: The Troth, Runes, Hex-signs, Seith Magic, and much more. This book, however, is not in depth in these subjects, but a great introduction to them. If you are looking for information on Runes of the Elder Futhark, I wouldn't count on this book, however Thorsson introduces the Younger Futhark and covers them pretty well (one page on each rune, front and back!) I also recommend this book for the advanced, because it introduces new customs as well. Be sure to check out other books by Thorsson."
5,Operant Hexology,"I give this book 5 stars not for its information on runes or norse mythology, but for the small chapter on the Pennsylvania Dutch Hexsigns. I am very interested in Hexology and Powwow, and read anything I can get my hands on about it. Mr. Thorsson has given the reader a basic introduction to Hexology, examples of Hexsigns, and pretty good history too. I cannot speak about the rest of the book, but buy it for the hex information if for nothing else."
2,Not my favorite,I picked this up because Thorsson is widely acknowledged as an authority on modern esoteric runeology and the northern path but I didn't get that impression from this book. It wanders off into places that feel silly or irrelevant to the subject and most of the sources he cites are his own previous works. The section on hex signs was interesting but really is not part of the northern path and would be better published as it's own book. There is some good stuff in the rest of the book but you have to work to sift it out and you could find much of the same information elsewhere.If you are a fan of Thorsson's work you will probably like this as well but I think I'll pass.
3,Good book,Only thing I did not like is he looked at the newer futhark not the older one. The older one speaks to me more and is used more.
1,BOWL SANDER,"MORE OF A TOY THAN A REAL TOOL FOR WOODWORKING. THE ONE INCH DIAMETER SANDER IS CLOSE TO USELESS. THE 2 & 3 INCH DIAMETER UNITS CAN BE MADE TO WORK IF YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL. GOOD IDEA, BUT POORLY DONE. AMAZON DELIVERED PERFECTLY. JUST THE PRODUCT IS POOR !!!!"
2,Ok if used lightly,These are nice for very light applications but any pressure applied and they crack. Used them on a bowl last night and the 1 inch tore quickly and flew apart. If they were cheaper they might be worth it but at this price I can't see buying more just to have them tare after 20 or 30 minutes. While it was working it did a very nice job and saved my fingers as well but I'll go back to just doing it the hard way after the other discs wear out. Nice try but I can't get behind this product unless something is improved.
1,"should have listen to the other review, i did better, lasted 10 minute for me. now i'm stuck with 25 buck worth of 2 inch sand","should have listen to the other review, i did better, lasted 10 minute for me. now im stuck with 25 buck worth of 2 inch sand. During the 10 mins went thru 3 - 80 g pads. Ran the one inch for a min and its cracked. using gorilla glue on both tonight, Just to bad, i'm very disappointed"
2,Class Requirement,I only purchased this because it was required for a Spanish class I was taking. The story itself has key learning points but the story wasn't especially moving.
3,Incorrect description,"The description says it has English subtitles. However, there are none@!~It IS a fabulous movie... highly entertaining. Love it!"
3,Un Cuento Sencillo Para Todo el Mundo,"Después de ver parte de este película en mi clase de universidad, no me interesaba mucho, pero después de mirar el resto, creí que fue un cuento extraordinario. Se trata de un pobre que tiene una familia en México y nunca hay suficiente comida para su familia. Sueña con tener un guajolote solamente para si mismo, y un día realiza su sueño. Cuando trata de comer esto, tres personas lo encuentran, y a este punto el argumento desarrolla...no voy a decir más; ¡mire esta película para saber la conclusión!Sí, es una película interesante, pero lo que me gustó mucho fue la simplicidad del cuento y de los papeles. Aunque es un cuento sencillo, dice mucho de la humanidad, de una persona y sus deseos. Se dará cuenta que los actores de esta película desempeñan muy bien y son bastantes guapos :)También esta película es buena para los estudiantes que aprenden el español. Hay escenas que describen bien la cultura méxicana como el día de los Muertos."
1,The Phone That Keeps Cutting Out,"I was so excited to get this phone. It has so many features including a speaker phone on the handset which is great when someone puts you on hold.However, from the first day I got it (and I've only had it a week) it kept randomly cutting out during conversations. I heard dead air space and the person on the other end would hear a beep sound. The person on the other end would think it was their call waiting.So now I've driven my friends crazy thinking their was something wrong with their call waiting. Other than that the range on the DSS was great but the sound quality was a bit tinny compared to an analog phone.I don't recommend this phone and am still searching for a phone with good range, good sound, that doesn't cut in and out. Is that too much to ask for?"
1,Phone keeps cutting out,"I would not recommend this telephone. I have had the same problem where, during a conversation, the telephone keeps cutting out. On my end I hear nothing for anywhere from a brief 1/2 second to seomtimes several seconds. On the other end the other party hears beeping. I'm on my 2nd telephone from At & T with the same results. I can't use this phone!"
1,Poor Sound Quality,I have used this phone for quite awhile. The sound quality is just terrible. There is a constant echo. Do not buy this phone.
1,Call Waiting ID Doesn't Work on This Lousy Phone,"Very Disappointed! I thought this phone would be the ""cats meow"" with all of the features, and the expandability. Bought two more handsets after we bought the original base unit and 2 handsets. I think since day one, the call waiting ID worked 3 times or so. Had AT&T send us a whole new setup including new base unit and new handsets and the problem is still there. Just had AT&T send us our 2nd new base and the problem is still there. Wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. This phone has many problems including poor sound, lackluster performance, just plain bad. Wish I could get my money back! Good Luck!"
5,The Innocence of the 70s,"This is a book full of aphroisms that are often uplifting and enlightening. The 70s were a time of pop therapy, and often the ideas seemed to promise an inner peace, a spiritual utopia. I'm not sure how applicable these beleifs are to our era, as they now seem to be oversimplifications of a complex and alarming world. A bit on the polyana side of life. Nontheless, Prather's insights are good to dip into when you are feeling blue, and long for something with zen-like simplicity."
5,Best tea,"We had this tea in the UK while visiting some friends and vacationing. We asked what type of tea they were using since it was so good. We bought some Twinnings Everyday tea and brought it back to the states with us. After running out in a few months we were desperate,luckily we were able to get it through Amazon. Thanks."
2,A Deadly Yarn (Knitting Mystery),"I like the characters and setting in the novel, but the plot is rather thin and predictable. However,as a knitter, I find the frequent references to the various knitting projects that the characters are working on rather energizing.... it makes me want to get out my needles and work.A Deadly Yarn (Knitting Mysteries, No. 3) [Mass Market Paperback]"
1,Couldn't make it past page 50,"This book contains the most stilted dialogue I've seen in a long time. In nearly every sentence the characters address each other by name. ""Isn't it a nice day, Kelly?"" ""Yes it is, Curt."" ""I love days like this, Kelly."" ""I do too, Curt.""That's a slight exaggerations, but if you are used to skilled writing, find another book to read!Ugh!!!"
3,"story is good, printing is awful","The story is fine, if you can get past all of the misprints. I lost count, there were so many: at least 3 in the first sixty pages. As a stickler for spelling, grammar and punctuation, these many printing errors detracted from the enjoyment of this book. Errors included confusing two character names: Burt and Curt, in one place Curt is called Curl. If you can get past all of that, it's a good story. These errors may not occur in all printings."
4,More predictable,This one was a bit more predictable than some of the series but still good. It was nice to add in the weaving aspect but there wasn't really any information on weaving. That would have been nice.
4,A Spectrum of Sound and Emotion,"Cruiser provides 'Some Songs' taking listeners through a spectrum of sound and emotion. The album is a fascinating listen, full of interesting and original songs. It is a musical experience, not just another cd to pop in the player. There is no denying the amazing musician-ship of this band. Cruiser leaves me anxious to hear what they will produce next."
3,An alternative sound . . .,"The band appears to have influences from alternative groups like REM and The Cure. Good arrangement for a debut album, definately worth a listen."
3,One must ask. . . . .,"This album begs the questions: ""on what day did God create Cruiser, and couldn't he have rested on that day?"""
1,Muddy and Unrecognizable,Thought the live show was okay but the CD is muddy and unrecognizable. Maybe it was just a bad production job but the songs all sounded alike too.
2,Huh?,"Started out okay, but after a while it sounds like REM in a washing machine. Couldn't really hear the lyrics, I don't know how anyone else could."
4,Excellent first recording!,Cruiser's first CD is pretty darn good. I hope their show Friday night at the Drink is as good as the CD.
1,Not sure what I received,"Very disappointed with the product that I received. I have seen the Paragon chrome water filters, and this did not compare. I am not sure if someone swapped out a return, and that I received this unit on a later order... but the product that I received was really poor quality. The chrome all over the unit was blistering off, and the screws on the bottom were corroded. Definitely returned it."
2,"Looks good, taste, not so much,Chlorine odor anybody","I have just received this chrome countertop water filter, 36 hrs ago, and here is what dissapointed me:-Packaging is awful, no name on the box, box was falling apart, barely houses the product.-Instructions are poorly put together, no technical information whatsoever, I was stunned.-All the above was not an issue at first, however alarming. I installed the countertop water filter, no problem, let the water run for 15 minutes before drinking a glass. Water looks very clean in the glass, I was pleased, and here comes the bomb; the odor isn't odorless, chlorine odor is so pronounced it is as strong as the tap water.Twenty four hours later, same, chlorine odor, it reminded me of a swimming pool odor, you get the picture. I have just processed a return to Amazon, back to Brita till I find the right countertop water filter."
5,Excellent Countertop filter,"Sturdy construction, not plastic parts which have in the past leaked and broken on me, feels like it will last a long time, if it doesn't I'll be sure to come and update this review. Comes with a tool to loosen the unit to change filters. Yeah, it takes a bit of muscle to do it. Works great. The filter that comes with it is alright, but if you want a really good filter to go with it, the Omnifilter CB3 is the one I've been using for these style units for years and it really works well to filter out the impurities and improve the taste."
2,Not what I thought,"I had the paragon filter in the past and LOVED it. Don't be fooled...THIS IS NOT THE SAME! AT ALL! I have had it for a week now, waited a while before writing this review because I was hoping the taste would change. It has NOT. It tastes EXACTLY like drinking from the HOSE OUTSIDE! Everyone that has tried it has said the same thing without being prompted. It does look nice, and the pressure is amazing. It was super easy to install. But who cares, if it tastes worse than the water pre-filtered! I am soo unhappy. I seriously doubt it filters all it claims to. The instruction pamphlet was a JOKE. The product box it came in was falling apart. Not labeled or anything. That should have been the red flag. I fully plan on returning this filter. I'll wait to get a Paragon. Really thought this was going to be similar, but no way. It's so gross!! The aftertaste is the worst. No one wants to drink it."
1,Don't Bother,"I was not impressed with this unit. I've been using PUR and Brita filters and decided to go with a counter top model instead. But this unit added a more unpleasant flavor to the water than what it removed. I could never, ever, ever recommend this unit. I was totally disatisfied and immediately returned it for a full refund."
2,I wish mine worked,"Just returned this product. Looked great, but couldn't get the canister to not leak. The top just wouldn't seat to the base. It looked great and I was hopeful that it would work as good as it looked. I think is was just a flaw in the base seal not a overall fault of the product itself. Wish it had worked out. Now I need to shop around, again. Shopping through AMAZON is the only way to go. They addressed my issue and I'm pleased with their service."
4,as filters go,"I like it that it's chrome. It actually looks like stainless steel and to maintain the finish all you have to do is rinse and dry with a cloth and it shines like in the photo. I was a bit concerned about not being able to find the right filter but it was actually offered on the same page but not from the same seller. Then I was worried it would leak as so often happens with these models, but so far so good. It's 6 months so I changed the filter. A couple of times someone turned on hot water including myself so I figure even though it said the filter is good for a year we probably messed it up.I had the plastic housing for this model and it always leaked. I had to mess with it to get it to work properly. Sometimes just taking out the o ring gaskets worked but this model doesn't leak.Just put the new filter in and no fuss no problem - and I use the water for cooking. I still buy the bottled to carry and am just spoiled but this water is good no doubt."
4,it works fine EXCEPT for one thing..,"it works perfectly except that it doesnt plug in properly in the back USB port in my comp. but with a USB extention cable, it works fine. id recommend this product, but if it doesnt work in the back USB port, be ready to shell out another 5-10 bucks on a USB extention cable."
4,So far so good,It works great after open box. You can hook into key chain. It's doesn't require any drive. If you want to buy this. You should get bigger capacity up to 1 GB. A little bigger compares with some others but still O.K.
3,Better to wait for 2nd generation. It must come out soon.,"2nd generation MBA with 45nm Penryn will solve current problems such as storage, interface connector, blackout problem, while most of the beauty of it will remain the same. I need to emphasize that I LOVE MBA design. First, 80GB is so small that you will see more than 1/2 of 80GB is required by OS, VM and major applications. Performance is getting even slower due to its storage bottleneck. At least two USBs and Ethernet are must. It is sacrificing flexibility so much to reduce its size and weight but I do not feel it does not have a fair balance for regular users. I still encounter occasional blackout and freeze problem when I leave it for a few hours, which has not been solved even through Apple's technical support.I definitely think next one will be much better and Apple knows how we feel about MBA. I believe they could respond to what we feel very soon."
2,I REGRET Buying it :(,"I gave it 2 stars just because its an apple product. Don't fool your self you WILL need a cd drive and you will end up buying an external one anyway. its hard drive memory so small, its hardly can enable you to store ANY THING! so I ended up buying the time capsule too. One USB port is never enough and although I knew all these facts before I bought it and I do have another macbook older version I just struggle with this machine constantly. buy the time I am writing this review and after saving all my files on my time capsule, I have only 23 GB left (mostly consumed by the OS and the updates) on my hard drive. the machine getting so slow now and the hard drive is cannot be upgraded."
2,poor wireless capability,"I have my MBA for six month right now. Overall I am almost happy, but.... Wireless antenna is not as powerful as I need. My MB pro can ""see"" 15 networks near my home, MBA only 6!!!!Sometimes It takes more than 30 minute to have internet access at airports and other places.Each time I arrive home it says ""there is not preferred networks in range"" !!! and it is my Home network!.This beauty travels really easy, everybody looks at it and it is sturdy. The lack of connectivity, the insufficient USB ports, and the underperformance make me think that I have something nice but close to useless."
1,"beautiful to see and touch, broke immediately, no apple support","This laptop broke after just a few uses. Being the first time to choose a mac air, I was needless to say, very disappointed. Apple support, which I fortunately never needed to use for my ipod, was not the least bit helpful. I would recommend a netbook or a dell laptop, save yourself the headache."
1,Do not waste your time and money,"Good for checking emails, and very light word/excel processing work. Otherwise it is really more a gadget than a real computer. Hard drive is too small for using it as a standard computer as you cannot store much info/data. Processing power too slow and even airport does not pick up all signals. Nice gadget...that's all it is. I do not recommend it."
5,Know Thyself,"There are so many opinions floating around about this latest Apple innovation, my simple reply is to think what works best for yourself. The *plus* in one's views may be the *minus* in another's. The Macbook Air is the perfect answer for my way of using a notebook computer. Study the forums, learn the features, and decide if it works. When you read the negative reviews, remember it could just be the Air does not fit the user's needs. Just as most all other notebooks do not fit my needs. The Air is for the simple, uncluttered life. When you KNOW yourself, this removes much of the confusion. Apple has heavy-duty alternatives, while the Air simply does exactly as it was designed to do... keeping your life simple, uncluttered AND productive."
4,A good reference for fixed income securities,"A compact book focusing on fixed-income market, derivatives, and risk management. Highly Recommended for advanced undergraduates"
4,Very Imformational adn Helpful,"I thought this book was good. It has very, very helpful tips on advertisment, getting started, meal tips, and so on. I liked the part with questions answered and a place to write about jobs and other info. I wish they print more things to do with kids at different ages. I mean you can't play games all the time. But the part with what to do in emergencies was GREAT!"
5,A Serious Subject Which Needed To Be Addressed,'He Belonged To Us' by Aurora Borealis is a work of fiction.This book is about underage drinking and the fierce competition of high school basketball.Violence takes place in professional basketball and alcohol is a strong factor in this violence.Violence also takes place in high school basketball and underage drinking triggers this violence.I believe what happened to the young man in this story was over the competition of high school basketball.I purchased the book itself and found it to read very smoothly.In a perfect world all books would be written about happy positive fantasy land subjects.Thank you Aurora Borealis for writing a work of fiction on a serious subject that someone had to speak out against.
2,bugs,Good basic starter information for new gardeners. Serious gardeners and professionals should search other options. Book may be a bit dated given the 1994 copyright date and the lack of color photos.
5,"Great Price, Great Item!",I got this product think because of the price it would be flimsy. But I bought because of the other 5 star review. It felt very sturdy when I pulled it of the box. It also includes a microphone clip. A good microphone cable isXLR male to XLR female Microphone Cable - 15 feet.
2,Seems nice.....but we can't tell....,"Looks like a quality microphone, but since it ships without a connecting wire we can't tell. Bought this to go with a Christmas gift, so there are some disappointed children. My fault for not reading the description entirely, but it never occurred to me it would ship without a wire. Just make sure to buy a wire if you buy this mic."
5,good mic,this mic is awesome sounds amazing better than a $500 dollar mic sounds clear and crisp and pics up all ranges of sound
2,Too descriptive and slow-moving,"I find the novel boring mainly because at four volumes, it is way too long and slow-moving for me. The novel itself is interesting, with a lot of sexual exploits by the protagonist. Pearl S. Buck called it the ""greatest physical love novel"" of China. Still you might be better off reading the condensed version of the novel."
3,"""In the tradition of The First Wive's Club,"" it's NOT!","I love novels that feature a woman who's been done wrong by the man she loved, and makes a come-back that's bigger than anything she's lost. That's why I immediately snagged The Secret by Cynthia Victor. I was sorely disappointed.Rather than show the story of the heroine's inner struggle and strength, the author overwhelmed me with the endless muck of the rotton husband's disgusting character. It just went on too long. If she did that as a means of showing the reader, by comparison, the new hero's strong values, I feel that she failed there by making him too wishy-washy to qualify for the job.The reader has her ""revenge,"" so to speak, when the ex-husband loses it all (his mind included.) By the time that happens, I was kind of done with it all.I can't really say that I'd recommend The Secret, unless the premise just sounds so good to you that you can't resist. It wasn't that good for me."
4,Life's Lesson,"the Secret makes every woman realize how important it is to care about yourself and your well being. To have a happy family and home you must careabout your own state of mind. If you forfeit self respect you lose. It is a long way back. Well written and sad in so many ways. Great book, my book club loved it."
2,Expected Better,"Quite simply, I expected a better documentary based on the other reviews for this DVD; I expected better production quality and something at least worthwhile with regard to UFOlogy. I didn't see it in this DVD. First of all, the naration is terrible... the guy continues to repeat himself. It sounds like it was written by Seventh Grader trying to make sure his term paper has the requisite amount of words. The video is mostly stock video... and most of that isn't even from images in the 1970s. There are no re-enactments; a few drawings and a video of one abuctee speaking at some type of forum (this was the only thing that did make this worth watching). There is another DVD available here on Amazon about the various UFO incidents in 1973... I plan to purchase that one and compare the two... but for now, I'm feeling like I shouldn't have wasted my money on this one."
3,Startling Accounts and Historical Footage,"There have been several recent news stories about UFOs that may prompt you to want to learn a little more about the history of UFO sightings and this documentary provides a great introduction to the subject. The film ties in the historical events that were happening throughout 1973 and ties them in with the numerous UFO sightings during the time period. The pace of the film moves quickly at the beginning, moving back and forth from historical moments to UFO sightings. It focuses on a few more well-known UFO-related stories and offers photos and footage. As with aliens and UFOs, it is really up to the viewer to decide how much of the film is credible enough to be considered as fact."
4,I had no idea so many UFO related events occurred in 73,"UFO waves or flaps are nothing new. This documentary provides some excellent evidence from one of these events, the UFO wave of 1973. A good collection of these sightings were retold in excellent fashion via eye witness testimony, reenactments and news clips. Some high profile abduction cases and multiple witness sightings were also covered, including the Pascagoula Case involving Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker. Included in the bonus features was the 18-minute recording from Lt. Colonel Charles Halt (USAF) regarding the UFO over Rendlesham Forest encounter of 1980."
4,Rivetting wartime spy story.,"What a fantastic war movie this would make! A brilliant German spy has infiltrated the Army as a top officer and is determined to relay the plans for Operation Overlord,the landing of the allied forces on Normandy, to his masters in Berlin.A British Intelligence officer, Major Cuthbert Pargeter, a typical upper middle class military type, teams with his American counterpart, Colonel Linus Iremonger, a brash, outspoken former cop, to track down The Fox as they've dubbed the German spy.They follow a trail of destruction and murder to prevent The Fox from escaping to Germany with a copy of the war plans, even on to the beaches of Normandy. These events actually happened as was verified by the notes written by Colonel Iremonger in later life and was crucial to the success of D-Day."
1,Not worth reading,This book was very sour. I did not like the way it was written at all. I did not have the heart to finish it. It did not grasp my attention nor did I find it to be worth my time. The author spent too much time on the sexual aspect of the story and forgot all about the charms usually found in romance books. I would not recommand this book to anyone.
5,Take off your PC hat...and enjoy!,"MOONLIGHT MISTRESS is not politically correct by today's rather limited guidelines. But if you enjoy a very good, very sexy, very satisfying story about believable characters of the medieval age, then hurry out and buy MOONLIGHT MISTRESS. Phillipe is an arrogant, dominant alpha male, and Aelvina is the feistiest of feisty heroines. Their love scenes are often not tender, certainly not politically correct, but they are wonderful in fantasy romance, and there's a plot twist at the end that is so clever it had me saying, ""Of course!"" The only thing I can say about MOONLIGHT MISTRESS is I wish New York would publish more books like this. Feminists won't allow them to do that, though. It's really sad. MOONLIGHT MISTRESS is well worth reading, to anyone who still enjoys leaving reality for a bit and joining the world of fantasy medieval romance."
5,Love these dishes!,"Our family really loves these dishes, they are unique and very sturdy. I will probably be able to pass these on to my daughter when she is older, they seem that durable."
5,My Nephew Lost his,"I found him!!! My 2 year old nephew Nicky lost ""Turtle"" about 4 months ago when some posh child nabbed it from a tots music group my sister ran..the toy had lost his head (dog accident) and my sister had had to sew it all back together to keep nicky happy.. he loved turtle more than an thing they were permanently joined together.. they aren't for sale online in the uk and I had no idea what they were really called... after months of internet searches I found him! best toy I ever known! one happy boy when it arrives"
2,Clips break easily 2.5/5 stars,"Overall they are good and i would buy them again, but the little clips beak so easily just when you try to un-clip them. The picture you see is not what you get. The clip quality is much cheaper than shown. I bought five of these and they all have at least one broken clip but i have replaced them for about $.50 a clip."
3,Really was expecting more,"I really thought this book had a lot of potential. And it did in the first half but by the end, it lost it all. This book had a really good premise and interesting characters too. I loved the back story on every one and the exposition was interesting throughout. However, the ending didn't suit to well with me. Mainly because it felt anti-climatic and above all the villains don't die but get arrested. Really, just arrested after they killed how many people and destroyed how many lives?"
2,Mediocore,I was sorely disapointed in this book. It was an intersting idea and may have done well in the hands of a better author.
3,"Not bad - too much ""self hating"" racism though","This book is a gritty detective novel set in DC with both black and white characters. The local flavor is PERFECT. I think you can go to every single place mentioned and find it exactly as described.What takes away the stars is while the author is white, he can't seem to let go of ""white people = evil racist at worst or can't help themselves racist at best"" and he REALLY hates white-yuppie people apparently. My memories of the late 80s to mid 90s era Georgia Avenue corridor was a sea of ugly low budget low class strip mall type retail. The author, through his characters, seems to really dislike any attempt to improve this urban eyesore. Also the ending felt a little odd.Spoiler>>>>>.................Multiple murder is not what I would call the best solution to a problem for the good guys. Felt very odd."
2,Annoying,"Not much of a mystery - more like a sociological treatise masquarading as a mystery. Race is on center stage in this book, but only in a slipshod way. Basically, the black characters are drawn as multi-dimensional human beings, while most of the white characters are stock villians. As such, it starts to remind you of Blaxploitation literature of the '70s. As a resident of DC, I was also irritated by the endless moaning over how the city has changed in recent years, as though its a sin to open a decent restaurant downtown! All in all it was a decent read, but I won't be coming back for more."
1,right as rain,"i have read 160 pages and still am not compelled to continue this book to the end. the plot is boring and predictable . it does not pull you forward, wondering what happens next. the writing is very good, no question about that; but it proceeds too slowly and has not grabbed my interest. i will read lahaine, colben, crais, and connelly before coming back to pelecanos."
3,"Good read, poor Kindle edition",Right as Rain was my first read of Pelecanos' work and I picked it up mostly based on positive reviews. I almost didn't make it past the first two chapters because of the editing...which seemingly had every other word hyphenated. Between the hyphenation and jive talk character dialogue I found the book hard to read. Overall the story and characters were just OK for me and I'm not likely to read the rest of the series.
3,Good Story but lousy editing,"This is a gritty detective story based primarily in Washington, DC. It was action-packed, as we follow Strange and investigating the truth behind an old crime. My enjoyment of the book was marred by the author's annoying overuse of sentence fragments and sloppy editing."
3,Not Quite THE WIRE,"George Plecanos RIGHT AS RAIN is a perfectly acceptable crime action thriller. The protagonists are all flawed, and the plot is reasonable. But, it might be the rare case where seeing the filth and poverty and desperation that comes from drugs might be more powerful than the words."
1,Dead Boring,"Dull slow story, dull characters. I'd read Walter Mosley over this Pelecanos when it comes to stories involving black characters."
3,Book vs. Kindle Edition,"I'm currently about 2/3 of the way through the book. While the content is OK, I'm frustrated with the quality of this ebook. Many words have hyphens in non-hyphenated words. It is often difficult to tell when a section is ending and the scene is changing; it appears to be part of the previous paragraph. It makes the reading much less enjoyable."
1,Kindle version sucks,"I like Pelecanos and I like reading on my Kindle, but I do not recommend the Kindle version of this book at all. Whatever software was used to convert it could not distinguish dashes from hyphens. Thus a word like cut-off is written cut--off, with a hyphen. Words that came at the end of sentences and shouldn't be hypenated at all are written with a dash in the mid--dle. This makes for very annoying reading. Buy the book if this is the best they can do."
2,Simple,"Terribly simplistic book. The only redeeming qualities are that it is a very fast read and it is always interesting to read books based in DC which do not involve politics. The story was weak and simplistic and the characters were right out of a cereal box. If only I could get/understand all of the music references, maybe that would have made the book more solid. In my opinion, find a different crime novel to read, maybe even another Pelecanos book."
4,Travel with an history background,This book give to the reader and future traveller an unique vision of the history of this country. the writer help us to understand the people that inhabited this country and the geological features of this land of enchantment. For an european like me is the first and essential step to the visit of a country.
5,Probably the best travel guide for the high southwest.,"This is probably the best travel guide to the High Southwest in existence. Not overburdoned with factual data like most travel guides, this book provides plenty of vital information about food, lodging, shopping etc, while providing fascinating first-person narratives of experiencing the southwest, as well as background information such as geological and historical information that bring enrichment to anyone's travel experience. As an experienced traveler to the High Southwest who could perhaps write my own book on the subject, this book is both my constant reference and fun reading whenever I visit the area."
3,"Very personal guide, not comprehensive enough","I usually enjoy independently published guidebooks that strike out on their own path. But this guidebook is lacking in comprehensive details about the regions it covers. Too much space is devoted to the author's long-winded, subjective narratives about his own personal journeys on these trails and in these parklands. Not enough details are given about the breadth of activities available outdoors in this region.If you are looking for a guidebook with quirky anecdotal narratives, then buy this one. If you want a more comprehensive look at the Southwest with more helpful practical details for travelers, look elsewhere."
2,You get what you pay for,Great design nice the first look but after 3 months is garbage. It was a shame because I'd very nice
5,can't live without,Purchased this camera when it was on sale for 54-64 dollars can't remember exactly what price. It is a super camera with great clear pictures. We have 3 babies under the age of 2 and could not do without this. The monitor can add up to 4 cameras and will switch back and forth between rooms. I can see at all times what the children are doing. Very happy with this purchase and especially the price I bought it for. Would highly recommend to anyone that needs the commfort of seeing what your little ones are doing especially at bed time. We have a climber that has been clmbing out of her crib since 12 months this has been a valuable tool so we can see when the crib is empty and to go put her back in. Also monitor is portable so you can take outside while baby is sleeping and see what is going on. Love this item
5,Uematsu-san does it again,"Finally, a Final Fantasy movie soundtrack. After hearing so many versions of One Winged Angel. This version takes the cake especially with the new lyrics and adding The Black Mages into it as well.The other songs are nicely well done. Although some of them are on different albums.Buy this CD! It's worth every dollar."
3,Neil stars in New Zealand/ U.S film debut,"The first film New Zealand film ever to be released in the U.S reflects the political and social issues of NW during the late 1970's early 80's. Neil stars as a political outcast that leaves his wife and child behind after being alienated by the oppressive government and a workers strike gone wrong. Interesting story line is confusing to follow and some odd direction bring down the points a little. Although, it is important for U.S viewers to remember NOT to get caught up in the specific issues within the film that we do not understand, because after all, we do not live in New Zealand, and could not possibly come to fully comprehend the political issues of the time period. I recomend that viewers pay attention more to the characters and the interesting course they take rather than the actual issues presented in the film, because they will prove to be hard to follow."
2,"If not familiar with his shows, his books are virtually useless....","Don't get me wrong, I love his shows, although I think his rooms are somewhat overfilled with stuff. His built-ins and projects are great!However, unless you've taped his shows, the instructions for the few projects he did include (l really would have liked the instructions for the desk in the kid's race car room but it wasn't there--looked very ""Jetsons"") leave a LOT to be desired. And instead of nice pictures of the entire room and full furniture layouts, you got a lot of his drawings over the color pictures.So, bottom line, you cannot just pick up this book and hope to do this stuff without watching the particular episodes he's referring to.I hope future books are written to correct this problem (present in all the books except his entertaining book), and also that he puts out a book with ALL of the projects he builds in it, with good instructions and lots of pictures."
3,Too much like his first book,"As much as I hate to say it and as much as I like Christopher, this book had me falling asleep. Literally. It was so much like his first book, and alot of things sounded the same. Alot of the pictures looked familiar also. But regardless...I STILL LOVE CHRISTOPHER, and everything that he represents! He is awesome!"
3,its okay,"When I first ordered the chair I was SO excited, but it took 3 whole weeks to get to me which was a real downer. Once it came it was not at all what I expected.PROS:The fabric is not soft but can be cleaned easily. Comfy to sit in but only sit and is durable so it'll last a while.CONS:It is perfect for sitting in but not for lying or curing up in. this will vary of corse for you size but I am only 5 feet tall so its not large.One other thing is that it is really orange not that rusted orange you see in the picture it extremely orange I mean like bright hurt you eyes orange."
2,Well...,"I didn't much like this album since it's basically a collection of songs from their earlier CDs (Peep, Playboys, Hell of a Tester, Into...which I have because I'm a nut). And, as an added note, The Rasmus' previous work is very different from their current (Dead Letters). Either way, it's still The Rasmus. And according to their new album from...some site I can't remember, ""It's a change for the better."" (Which refers to Dead Letters and their new album.)"
2,Crooked!,"My scans come out crooked. If I align it at the top the whole thing has to be rotated. If I align it with a side, then it's off center. This is very frustrating and I will return it. The scans came out decent but very dark. I had to lighten them tremendously."
3,For the Kubrick fan,"This is a book of Kubrick facts and trivia, arranged in easy-reference format. The authors are opinionated about their subject, which is good --- they clearly love writing about these movies and everything that went into them. For the non-fan, this book could be tedious. Entries on actors veer off into complete discussions of the Kubrick movie in which they starred, minor details are repeated, and a few entries seem to be too technical or industry-based to be worth mentioning.(For example, Kubrick says that at the end of Lolita, Humbert realizes that he loves her --- he's not just feeling lust for her. Kubrick calls this the most poignant moment in the story. This particular quote is repeated in the book at least five times.)If you've read every other book about Kubrick, get this one. If not, read the books by Ciment, Walker, Herr, LoBrutto, and Baxter first."
3,Cute but oh so narrow,"These are very stylish -- a great looking shoe. BUT EEK -- they run very, very narrow, with a very low toe box too. I ordered the wide width which usually gives me more than enough room, but not in this style! A great disappointment because I love the look of them. If your foot is narrow, you'll love 'em though."
4,This I know CD Scarlet River,This is a great CD for anyone who loves soothing music. Jonathan Jackson wrote most of the songs and music on the album. His talent is great. His passion for the lord is awesome. His guitar and piano playing is beautiful and you can see how he grown as a musician since his last CD God Candy. The CD is more intimate than his previous CDs. It is a love song to god. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to get in touch with the lord and anyone who just loves great music and lyrics.
5,Splendid!,"A necessary book for every Wiccan. I wasn't expecting to learn much because I've read hundreds of books and have been practicing for years. Was I WRONG. This book gave me more encite to sharpened my 'spiritual' tools in the first 30 pages. Her explanations are clear, her techniques simply spoken. (The personal stories only add to the feeling of being taught with consideration and patience) The 'Work' sections are, I feel, necessary to truly living this life. Its a book to take you levels deeper, to teach the things you can't learn without being an apprentice of a skilled teacher.(Like Silver) Or in a coven. I suggest anyone who wants to begin learning the ways of Wicca,(Since we never stop learning) to start with Scott Cunninghams; Wicca, A guide for the Solitary practioner & Living Wicca, A further Guide to the Solitary Practioner and Silver's 'To Ride a Silver Broomstick,To Stir... and To Light...' Silver's books are a foundation I wish I'd had 8 years ago."
3,"not bad, not great.","of all of silver's books, this is the one that i wouldn't warn people AWAY from. the exercises and anecdotes are useful, funny, and occasionally even spiritually conducive. if all you're seeking in paganism is some magic in your everyday life or some religious expression that's non-threatening and fun, this approach will do it for you. however, if you're searching for a deep, spiritual connection to some being or power greater than and beyond yourself - in other words, to go deeply into the religious life - this book will not help you."
4,"If you liked ""To ride a Silver broomstick"" then","This is a book that will take you to many more heights in magick. This book,i felt, went way beyond its earlier counterpart by going much more into depth. the first book took me a week to read. But, i still read over this one to see what i have missed. Donald C. Gibel"
4,despite the controversy a good book for beginners,"i know alot of peope who either love or hate silver ravenwolf. i hapeen to be in between. to ride a silver broomstick was the first book i read on the craft. it covers alot of different information in one book. silver explains things so the beginner can understand it. i can unserstand why the advanced practioner would call her books ""fluffy"" and they are. but you can't expect a newbie to pick up a book by the farrars and expect to understand it."
2,under average!,"well, i felt awful after reading this book. and after that, i felt like i wanted to burn it! let me explain... this book has lot of things to offer, but...everything should be done in the way what ravenwolf thinks is the best way to do them. i don't do things in that way! i do them like i feel and i want! this book would be much much better if ravenwolf would understand that there are many humans, casting and practicing in THEIR styles, or in the different traditions. this book is built with some devotions, salutions, many ways to cast a circle, some spells, VERY short looks about different magicks (like herbal and etc.), and too much patriarchal stuff and auhor's opinions and wiewpoints, what left me only confused and angry. if it doesn't bother you, buy this, but if you need some support for your own practices, or you are beginner, stay as far as you can!"
2,"A second helping of Sugary Marshmallow Peeps, please","As if once wasn't enough, she gathered up all the saccarine and marshmallows she left out her her first book, and threw it together into a sequel. At least this one has a more organized layout, but that's the best I can say about it. No student of the higher mysteries should waste their time with this. However, if you are a fluffy bunny new ager, go ahead."
4,Another good one by SIlver,"I truly recommend this book for all beginning ""alternative religion"" questors. Although some don't like Silver or her beliefs, I think that her books are some of the best written for the beginners. I have recommended this set of books over some more ""traditional"" books, such as Ray Buckland's Big Blue. I think that Silver does a wonderful job explaining things in a manner that make them very easy to understand, yet does not make the reader feel like a complete idiot. I will continue to recommend her books to all who ask.Brightest Blessings"
3,Not bad-but not her best =+),"I love Silver, she has a great author personality! She is a great read, easy to read and understand and puts you to work. However I dont think this is one of her better works. Its not bad, but not the best. She tends to loose her readers (at least me ) in this book, by the second chapter. I found myself drifting uninterested! I was surprised, because as a whole her books are very good. Its not the best for a first time wicca. Informitive yes, but I think it tends to get to far from the points she tries to make."
5,"Great and Useful Book, I Know her real name ! ! !","This is a great and useful book for those who have graduated from ""Wicca 101"" books. It was very interesting and informative. It is a great book that makes you practice the things that the book teaches.The only thing I didn't like was the chapter on circle castings. Do we really need 20 ways to cast a circle? I think not. Other thatn that, this is a very recommended book, even if you ""hate"" Silver RavenWolf.Now, about her real name. Her magickal name is Silver RavenWolf and her real name is Jenine E. Trayer. If you took the time to read the ""Introduction"" you would know that. She always puts her magickal name, real name, and the date she wrote the ""Introduction"". Some of you people should really read the ""Intruductions"" in the books you read, it might just tell you something about the book you are reading."
1,Buy something to eat instead,Theres really not much to say...its that awful for words to even mentioning it.
2,Sounds like something I've read before...,"Now don't get me wrong, but this book has been done. It's called to Ride a Silver BroomStick. I just found that I didn't really learn that much new information and it sounded a lot like her other books. That made it difficult to read because I felt like I knew what was coming.I truely believe that every Pagan should read at least one of her books... but they get a bit repetitive after a while."
3,Ritualistic and unethical...,"Silver likes to focus on both the religious and ""scientific"" aspects of the Craft, however I feel she loses herself in ritual. While she attempts to encourage the practice of magick with mindpower alone without focus on ritual, it is apparent that she is most comfortable with ritual and perhaps believes this to be a truer form of Witchcraft. Another thing that bothers me about Silver's personal tradition is that while she believes in the Wiccan ""harm none"" philosophy, she makes no mention of being a vegetarian or vegan, and actually has spells to help her husband's hunting success. To me this is a direct contradiction. She also encourages prosperity spells, an activity I believe always harms someone.She should think more carefully about the use of magick for personal gain. She is leading us into some very real and powerful magick, i just wish I could trust her judgement."
4,"A Great Read, Lots Of Information","I had to read this book several times to have everything sink in. I suggest reading one chapter at a time and performing the exercises she suggests for each chapter before you move on. I got a little confused because I breezed through it. Not recommended for ""light reading"". This book goes very deep into the different aspects of Wicca and how they affect our lives, and the lives of everyone around us! Take your time. Definitely worth the read!"
2,"Some was okay, some stunk","In this book, Silver is always saying, ""before you do this or that, make sure you've done a dedication ritual so the universe will know who you are."" What's up with that? The Goddess made you, she should know who you are whether or not you've ""dedicated"" yourself. We are all the Goddess's children, so we don't need to dedicate ourselves to Her. But besides that, the planetary hours and symbols and stuff were pretty good."
4,Not bad at all,"Silver's style is always incredibly user-friendly. She uses a conversation-like tone that does away with overly technical or outdated terminology. I found the general topic coverage to be pretty good, essentially, although I would have liked to have seen more historical content. It's a little ""fluffy"" at times - and by that, I mean it has a tendency to paint Wicca as something very ""in"" and fashionable, an almost Hollywood-like entity - but overall, Silver covers a lot of ground that beginners in particular will find easy to understand.Subjects covered include divination, basic circle casting, meditation skills, basic spellwork and healing.Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in Wicca and Neopaganism, with one caveat: Make sure you also buy ""Drawing Down the Moon"", by Margot Adler, and something by Joseph Campbell or Mircea Eliade, to ensure a well-rounded Pagan knowledge base."
5,great peice of non-fiction,even better than to ride a silver broomstick. I have tryed many things from this book and it works. I have had less trouble in life and found peace with my self thank You Silver.
1,If your serious about Wicca then this isn't the book for you,"If you're really interested in learning more about Wicca. Then you should take $ilver RavingWolf's books with a grain of salt. Her books are completely commercialized and if you do end up practicing Wicca you will have to completely unteach yourself all the things she teaches.If you're new to Wicca and looking for a good book to get you started then I highly, highly, reccomend Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A guide for the solitary practicioner.Wicca is all about learning, and you can't find all of your answers from just one book but I can assure you that SilverRavenWolf's books will not help you if you truly wish to learn and practice Wicca."
2,another book for my collection,"I found this book more entertaining than helpfull. I love to read and share books of intrest with friends and family but this book is not one I would recomend to them because of fluff, some subjects of intrest are short. I have found some things to be as if ""do it my way"" oriented."
5,Ravenwolf,Ravewolf is an amazin write...readn her books make u feel like ur talkn to a great friend..and will continue to read her books.
1,"Hokey, trite, and not worth the money","I found this book to be little more than a repeat of Silver Broomstick. There was nothing in the way of new information, or new understandings. Instead, it was simply a re-hash of what had already been said before, and better the previous time. My other real problem with the book is that, if it was truly seen as ""advanced"" it gives people the idea that they are farther along in their studies than they are, making true self-judgement much more difficult."
1,Atrocious.,"This book, like all of Ravenwolf's books, is utterly atrocious.I'll admit that when I first looked into this religion, all of nine years ago, I bought this book and thought it was amazing. Now that I decided to sit down and reread the books that started my religious path, I can't believe I bought into all of the ridiculous tripe that Ravenwolf writes, even if it was only for a short time. Thankfully, I realized how useless Ravenwolf's books were after less than a year into my studies.She's the worst author on Wiccan and Pagan topics you can find. Not only are most of her ""facts"" complete falsehoods, but she writes in such a way that it's hard to follow what she's talking about. Seriously, Ravenwolf, you're writing a book that's supposed to be educational. It's not your personal journal, meant to boost your own ego.If you want a good book on witchcraft, look into Penczak's Temple series books. Don't buy into Ravenclaw's 'fluffy-bunny' syndrome that has no basis in reality."
3,A cute little book,"Despite the appalling quality of Ms Ravenwolf's other work, I quite liked this one.The main focus of the book is on improving your magickal ability and fine tuning your ritual skills, for example, Casting the Circle and Calling the Quarters. The exercises are quite fun and some even make you think. There's some comdey in there too, for example the start of the calling the Quarters chapter. :)This isn't the best book about Wicca and Witchcraft, however, if you are a well read Pagan and have had some experience in the Craft, this book can give you some ideas to freshen up your ritual practices. All in all, it's not a bad read."
4,Good for Advancing Witches,"While I'll admit that some of her anecdotes in the book made me want to skip ahead to see if I could spot some content, I must say that this book does function as a great medium level book on magic. Trhere are very few good books for non-beginners because most books of them end up as extravagent and overly complicated. Ms. Ravenwolf took the basics of magic and looked at them a littl emore deeply. For example most practitioners know how to summon the watchtowers but Silver disects shows you some of the deeper meanings and then shows you how you can personalize it. I would recommend this for the practitioner looking for something more."
1,Stir Stir Stir,"Stir the stars up a bit maybe the rating people ought to take over this site or get some new help. It's like this book, all wet and no reality!"
1,Stir Stir Stir,"Here we go again, missing reviews? Whatsa matter? Can't take the heat from the magic cauldron? I think you better stir your cauldron a little more. Looks like you stirred too much trash in it. It's time to collect your winnings and put your broom back in the closet with this one. All your writings are the same with different titles. It's getting to be a joke in the community. There really should be zero's in here for ratings. If you can take the truth. You know Truth??? Something your books don't have when it comes to the ways of the Crafts. Sorry if you don't like this review. If you don't leave it out so many others do! Even the reviews are getting to be snickered at around the boards! Get a day job! PLEASE"
2,Gets dirty easily,"It seems under-stuffed for a teddy bear. Also, it shows dirt easily: it hasn't been played with hard, yet now it looks a bit dirty.There weren't many Pooh bears available when I was looking, so perhaps this is the best there is. But generally it feels cheap. I don't think I'd spend money on it again."
5,One Hot CD!,"This album is one of his best. I think BG should go back to Cash Money. I don't know the reasons for him leaving, but Life After Cash Money don't have nothing on this cd. I like almost ALL the tracks on here. This is where the Bling-Bling era began. Just look at the album cover. One blazing CD."
4,it's veeeeery goood,I had not heard about B.G. then i downloaded some mp3z and now i have the whole album... songs like Hard times it is killing !!!
4,dont hate,look i like everything from classic wu tang to kool keith but you gotta look at the music as just being fun. this is not a masterpiece lyrically by any means (though bg throws a few nast hooks) but the beats are slamming and bg is the man
4,CHOPPER CITY IN THE GHETTO IS ANOTHER BIG HIT FROM C.M.R.,CHOPPER CITY IN THE GHETTO IS ANOTHER BIG HIT FROM CASH MONEY RECORDS. B.G. HAS REALLY TAKEN HIS MUSICAL TALENT TO ANOTHER LEVEL. THE CASH MONEY ARTISTS SHOULD AND EVENTUALLY WILL BE RECOGNIZED NATIONALLY FOR THEIR TALENT AND UNIQUE SOUND. MANNY FRESH SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN RECOGNITION FOR DROPPIN' THOSE TIGHT BEATS ON THIS AND OTHER ALBUMS FROM CASH MONEY. CASH MONEY IS TRULY AN ARMY; SO HIP HOP ARTISTS EVERYWHERE NEED 2 BEWARE!
5,Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhht!!,"I just got the album today, and let me just say, he is better than dmx,and all them other new york rappers put together!! All of the songs are tight. So by it. You won't be sorry! Biatch!!!"
5,BUY IT.,This is a very strong LP by MR. DORSEY - BG.Even though he is under 25 - he has put out 7 ALBUMS and 3 ALBUMS with the HOT BOYS ( GORILLA WARFARE IS THE BEST.)other Albums by THE BG worth getting areTRUE STORY - ITs ALL ON U VOL.1 and 2.
5,BLING BLING,"ooooooooohhhhh... gotta luv da BLING BLING, baybee!! well.. I have 2 words foe y'all out there.. BLING BLING!!"
5,GHETTO,"This album is ghetto. da tight tracks are 2,3,4,5,7,8,10. This is da best album by da b.g. if ya dont like him get da three 6 mafia compilation of hypnotize camp posse"
2,Cash Money Is A Smarmy (only the smart people can get that),"This CD gets two stars for ""Cash Money Is An Army"" and ""Bling Bling."" The rest of the CD is undesirable lyrically, but the beats are tight. If you want a party record, do yourself a favor and get a mixtape or something because this CD isn't worth the cheddar."
4,dis be tight slammin,dis sheet be ill ya'll if ya dunt pick up dis motha fo u be missin a tight album yo big ups ta da peeps on strong island
1,no limit 4ever,"Look at the cover of this cd! It looks like a no limit cover with some imposter on the front. Cash money is an army? I don't see any tank! The beats are so-so, but the lyrics? Pathetic! Cash Money needs to go sit down No Limit is the only army of the N.O."
1,TOTALLY WACK AS SHYT,"B.G. JUVENILE, CASH MONEY R NOTHIN BUT NO LIMIT WANNABES. THIS ALBUM SUX. I KNEW NOT 2 BUY IT. I WISH I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ALBUM 0 STARS CAUSE THAT IT DESERVES. THIS IS NOT ''TRU'' HIP HOP. LISTEN 2 NAS OR DMX. THESE R REAL ARTISTS. NO LIMIT RECORDS IS THE LABEL OF THE SOUTH. IM OUT"
5,hari singh is the king,"Yo, whats up homeboys. I'm badman Hari from Woolworths and I'm rude. My beard is funky and fresh and I'm a fly gangsta with a bop, like my geezer Phil Moorcroft. B.G. is a great singer with a great body. Bbbbbiiiiigggggg bbbbbboooooooooyyyyyyyyy!"
2,good but not as good as DMX,4 all u RUFFRYDER WANABEE'S go to THE #1 DMX webpage and you will c were it's at
5,Great doc!,The blu-ray arrived quickly and looks fantastic! It goes beyond a typical music documentary and is an interesting character study of where this person is from.
2,Borrrrrrrrrrrrrring!!!,"I've been a Nirvana fan since 1990. Theres very little footage or interviews that i haven't seen. And this is one DVD i shouldn't have purchased. Theres no actual ""footage"", its all audio with random shots of ""small town nowhere"". The interviews are interesting, but not worth purchasing on Blu-ray."
4,Nifty dice,"These dice are pretty neat -- clear-ish plastic dice, each with a smaller die inside. Good for teaching kids about probability, fun to use with any board game in place of two standard six-sided dice, and fun for younger kids to just play with and enjoy."
3,too small,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. The outer dice is too small to allow the inner dice to move freely. Great idea, but needs some tweaking."
5,Visitors want one!,I had company (2 ladies) this past weekend. Now I need to order 2 more as Christmas gifts. They really enjoyed the gift tag concept and the recipes and both ladies want one for their daughters.
5,state of the art on innovation,"I'm searching for new ways to develop an entrepreneurial area at the university, and this book gave us more tools and knowledge to center in creativity rather than business plan the entrepreneurial curricula.It helps to develop an attitude to look for new ways of doing things."
2,faulty good,"*apparently been used ( can tell from the watch leather belt)*the watch dial is not at the right place* good price, attractive watch, but should alert the buyer the condition of the watch."
2,Too Small,"It was supposed to be plus sized, but if I had worn it I would have been arrested for indecent exposure. However the Seller was prompt."
5,perfect pump!,"This little bottle is perfect for dish soap. I love the size, weight and durability. We've had it a year and I love it!"
2,Glad to see Peter Fonda...but its still not the best Journey..,"Hard to beat the orginal Journey movie with Pat Boone. At leat that one had greatmusic, dinosaurs, great sets and also a pretty good movie.Since then, we have been bombarded with crappy remakes.This Journey is also not the best. It lacks all the good stuff from the first movie.So what we have is a very low budget movie. The good stuff about it, is thatsits really a family movie with almost no horror or violence or nudity or anythingelse that can offend. It also has been filmed in Vancouver with great scenery, andthe reason i bought this is Peter Fonda is in there. Some will say...Peter who ??Peter Fonda...the original EASY RIDER....man of many generations and many many movies is acting in this little film...yep thats a must have.So bottom line....fun little movie...but not the real thing."
4,Quite Good,"A simple film and still a bit of an adventure. Mike Dopud played a very convincing roll and it was nice to see him again whilst the Stagate Franchise seems to be on hold a while. Also Elyse Levesque had a small part. Shame not to see more of her. The story wasn't edited so well as it really lacked the exitment that could have been. Still, worth a purchase.I am surprised that Peter Fonder finds his face on the cover and the back jacket of the DVD whilst Mike Dupod is missing. It kind of doesn't present the story right. That annoyed me"
1,Heart of cinema darkness,"While this movie is titled Journey to the Center of the Earth, you'd never know that it was based on Jules Verne's book of that title. It's a slow, boring journey to the center of something, with a few birds and a plesiosaur - no dinosaurs - and a few hairy people. By the time the cast meets the natives, the movie becomes more like a bad remake of Heart of Darkness, with a grizzled explorer ruling over the natives. Only that ends pretty quickly. On top of this, the acting is lousy and a teenage boy provides utterly useless narration (as if we needed him to tell us when a guy and girl are flirting). The only positive thing I can say is that the special effects weren't half bad for a made-for-TV movie. Overall, avoid at all costs."
3,Pretty good,"Not the best Journey to the Center of the Earth, but pretty good....worth the time to watch it."
1,An utter disgrace,"I was mislead also as to the release of this tv movie with the big screen remake. This is a horrible disgrace to the book and original story.Pathetic CGI on par with bad Sci Fi channel movies like Anaconda 3 or Kimodo vs Cobra. Inconstant story line,horrible acting and racial stereotypes. And the kid says uncle so many times, it makes you want to put a foot to his grill. Save your money in another 6 months youll find this movie free in a trash heap.I expected more from Peter Fonda!"
1,Boring Disjointed Storyline; Little Acting; Poor CGI,"A North American volcano remake that tries to copy the original Journey but ends up with an unrealistic cave, lake and unknown source of sunlight. If there was a suspenseful point to the story or something approaching acting - I missed it. The science behind this remake must have come out of an elementary school dropouts imagination. The cheap, unrealistic CGI of a couple of ancient reptiles was inserted to provide a moment of comic suspense. Then replaced with Native Americans that look like they've been living on the surface yet somehow are able to survive the crushing pressures and temperatures at some unknown depth. Sadly they are portrayed as stereotypic African villagers. And, hand held lasers can't be pointed 10 miles and be seen. People can't be carried in an underwater river and come out in the bottom of a large lake, then rise to the top as if they were in the bathtub - unless they're really marine mammals in disguise as humans."
2,Journey To The Center Of The Earth,This was the worst version of the story i have seen. it was made for tv movie a scyfy channel movie. i have seen better versions i liked the 1969 version and the version with brendan fraiser. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
2,Disappointing Journey,"I have the 1959 version with James Mason, and the 1999 version with Treat Williams, and both are much more entertaining that this one. I suppose the James Mason version holds a special place in my heart because it was the one that really wowed me as a young boy of 11. At that age, you don't look for scientific accuracies, and not even great acting ability. The surreal scenes and cryptic props were fantastic. And I enjoyed them just as much the last time I saw the movie a couple weeks ago. The Treat Williams version had some great new twists, like the indigenous tribe. It was also very entertaining.But this version was just plain dull! The indigenous tribe in this movie could very well have been a lost tribe from the Rain Forest. Other than the short scene with prehistoric animals, there was no fantasy effects. As one reviewer said, it is forgettable."
1,Holy Cruddy Movie,"This has got to be one of the best examples of a complete waste of time in my opinion. I am the kind of person that will sit through a movie to see if it gets better or to see if there is a point. This is a classic story, and the remakes are always hit and miss. When you have a good actor like Rick and an even better one with Fonda, you would hope for entertainment at the least. I did not expect a mind altering experience or a wonderful remake, but something entertaining. That is not too mauch to ask for, right? With this movie, it is way more to ask for. This movie is horrible, the acting is retched, and if ever there was a worse version of this movie, I have yet to have been forced to sit through it."
3,A Latina Alanis Morrisette?,"As a person who doesn't speak Spanish, I can never understand the DJ's on the radio when they announce who sings the songs. So it took me quite a while to figure out who sang 'Estoy Aqui'.I like the CD. I'd like to hear Shakira sing in Portuguese, to compare it to the Spanish. I think her voice and style are vaguely similar to Alanis Morrisette, yet I think Shakira deserves credit for developing an original style.The song 'Estoy Aqui' is very famliar to 'I'll Stand By You' by Chrissy Hines of the Pretenders. I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on that."
5,When listening to song 10 and 11 switch them (piez descalzos),When you listen to song 10 it is 11 and vice versa.
5,Enjoy this album !,"This is probably the second best album by Shakira. It sounds fresh and fine. English songs are also good, but not so naturally simple and moving."
2,A great single with an OK album,"I really liked Shakira's ""Estoy Aqui"" hit when it first came out. I was disappointed, however, that the rest of her songs did not have the same hit potential. Her yodeling voice becomes rather annoying (to me) after a while, but if you enjoy her trademark singing style, then more power to you. The lyrics in the songs sound contrived, and the accompanying music does not do much to give them a boost. But, with such a huge following, who am I to knock her music?"
5,"Solid sound, great rhythms",Newcomr reallys knows how to rock with cool meloidc songs about love and partying.
4,"A great cd, Estoy Aqui is classic!","This cd is really great, I was introduced to Shakira, by my Spanish 4 teacher, who always played this song, I grew to like Shakira a lot and bought all of her cds. Keep them a coming!"
5,Fantastic,Shakira has a very raspy voice which makes this a great album. She reminds me allot of another rocker Alanis Morissete. The songs are well written. My favorite song is Estoy Aqui.
5,Great songs and awesome sounds,This album is one of my alltime favorite of latin music. I love Estoy Aqui and Te Quiero. Shakira is really good on this and her newest album.
5,THIS CD IS A POEM...,"Best Shakira's Album EVER, the lyrics are very deep and the music wouldn't be better... If you think that Laundry Service is good, just get her first album... you will love it and maybe you will start to forget the last album.This is my TOP 5 Shakira's Album:5. The Remixes 3.8/5.0(good remix version of the first album but only 4 different songs)5. Laundry Service 4.0/5.0(very commercial, nice arrangements, Lyrics are totally uninspired)3. Donde Estan Los Ladrones? 4.5/5.0(excellent lyrics, keeps the soul of her debut album)2. Shakira: MTV Unplugged 4.8/5.0(Thousand times better than most of Unplugged sessions by MTV. Only comparable to Nirvana and 10000 Maniacs Unplugged (Natalie Merchant).1. Pies Descalzos 5.1/5.0(Inspiration at her 110%, the real songwriter and permormer)"
5,Best CD in Foreign Lanuage,"I had never heard of or thought of Shakira before. My Spanish I teacher told us about her but still didn't really get into it. I had never even heard her music either. My teacher did an assignment that we had to listen to the song ""Estoy Aquí,"" and pic out the words that we already knew or something like that. Ever since than everyone in my class wanted to listen to it all during class and we have if we have had extra time. I bought the CD after looking all over for it and finally found it. I listen to it every day even though i dont understand it all that well. I am trying to translate the words taht i know or can find the english word for. Its kind of working but not too much. The CD ""Pies Decalzos"" is the best music in Spanish of all time. and Shakira really makes it totally piece together w/ the lyrics, melodies, and her beautiful voice."
5,Where it all began...,Shakira's debut album is still one of the best albums of modern spanish latin rock/pop. Her english work will never be able to compare. If you want to experience true Shakira buy this album or 'Donde Estan Los Ladrones?'.
5,THE SHAKIRA THAT I MISS!!!,"I miss the old Shakira, she used to be original and fresh. since her english debut and her ""blond"" hair is not the same anymore. I hope she release another great album like this one."
5,Es un disco increíble; imperdible.,"Shakira es definitivamente una de las mejores, y me animo a decir que la mejor artista femenina en su genero. Su muúsica es atrapante e intensa, y sus letras son increíblemente profundas. Tiene canciones rockeras y tambien baladas, que estan muy bien elaboradas. Esta artista, a pesar de su juventud, ha demostrado un gran profesionalismo con este disco, y tambien se ve que es una persona que sabe expresar muy bien sus sentimientos. Este es un disco que contiene canciones como ""estoy aqui"", ""un poco de amor"", ""pies descalzos, sueños blancos"", ""se quiere, se mata"", que no pueden dejar de escucharse. Si eres un fan de la música rock-pop, este es un album que no puedes dejar pasar. Definitivamente se va a convertir en uno de los clásicos de la música en español de los noventas."
4,This girl is just so coooool...,"I've heard Shakira described as a ""Latin Alannis Morrisette"", which doesn't do her justice. Yes, she can rock just as hard, but unlike Morrisette she can *sing*, too. She's young, she's beautiful, she's enormously talented--I can hardly wait to see what she'll do next.The only reason I give ""Pies Descalzos"" four stars instead of five is because her most recent album, ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones?"" is just so damn good. I've thoroughly enjoyed ""Pies Descalzos""--don't get me wrong--but ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones?"" is simply a more mature, stronger work overall.I still heartily recommend this CD--it is a very strong work, particularly for one so young, and it is interesting to see how much Shakira grew as an artist in the brief time between this album and ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones?"""
5,Shakira Pies Descalzos Japan Edition,"Very good Japanese edition of the album ""Pies Descalzos"": 10 tracks beyond the standard edition comes with exclusive bonus tracks for Japan Only: Estoy Aqui (The Love & House Mix) and Estoy Aqui (The Remix). Item very scarce and highly recommended."
5,La Original,"The original!Before Shakira went blond. Before Shakira dressed scantily. Before Shakira sang in English. There was ""Piez Descalzos"", bare feet. Organic, true, and so far from Hollywood.One of my all-time favorites. Brilliant lyrics that didn't have to rhyme or be translated to make some sort of sense in English.This is still on my iTunes, love it!"
5,Shakira Rocks!,"It rocks! I've already made my review on the other ""Pies Descalzos""!Shakira Simply Rocks!"
3,"some terrific songs,but something's missing...","This is not a bad cd at all,tunes such as ""estoy aqui"" and ""pies descalzos,suenos blancos""and""vuelve"" not to mention ""antologia"" all stand out.However in my opinion she is still quite immature as a lyricist,I predict she will become a mega star on the trendy american pop market eventually.She mixes a bit of hard rock with folk,dance,and pop to come up with a sound all her own,and it sells,but there's just something missing..."
1,Ojos Asi is the only good song in her entire collection,Despite her whiny voice on every song Ojos Asi stands outI think she is a bad imitation of Alanis.
4,The Trans Siberian Adventure,This Trans Siberian DVD is a charming account of a couple's trip on the railroad. It provides interesting information about places to stop off and visit on the way through the countries of Russia and Mongolia. We enjoyed the ride and the historical background. It is very much a couple's home movie of their adventure - not a Steven Spielberg!
2,trans siberian railroad,I expected this to be about the trans siberian railroad. It was really a traveloge and had very little to do with the railroad other than as transportation.
2,Caught the wrong train...,"This was one of those times when Amazon did not provide enough information to make a choice. I was trying to buy the DVD of a movie that took place on the Trans-Siberian. Instead, I bought somebody else's home movies. Not what I wanted, so no way could I be satisfied with the outcome."
5,Lion Brand ribbon yarn,"I love this ribbon yarn. It's the first time I've used this type of yarn and found it a little different to work with to begin with. Also, the colors and more intense than what they appear to be online. I plan to use this product again and would highly recommend it."
5,Best book I have on Chinese cooking,"By far this is the most Chinese of all of the books I have on Chinese cooking. After returning home from living in China for several years, I know that Chinese cooking takes skill and practice and is not just a matter of measuring ingredients. In many ways it is about choices that can only be made with knowledge of Chinese culture. I feel that this book addresses many of the issues that are required for successful Chinese cooking. The author made no compromises, which is refreshing!"
5,My favorite cookbook ever,"I have had this book for over thirty years. it is torn, burnt, dog-eared and spattered with soy sauce. I love it! It is that rare book that has insightful anecdotes coupled with perfect recipes. A precious gem of a book, modest in scope and exquisite in detail."
4,6 yr old daughter enjoyed it.,She had an enjoyable airplane flight watching this movie on our Kindle. I would recommend this movie to girls 6+ years old.
5,Great Show,I am so glad to have Silk Stalkings on DVD. The third season is great. The show just gets better and better each season. I am looking forward to Season 4 on DVD. Love the characters Rita and Chris. They remind me so much of Benson and Stabler on Law and Order SVU. This is a great show for those who like Law and Order SVU. It may not be as gritty as Law but it still has great story lines. This is a must for those old fans of the show. Go buy it!
5,Great!,"My hubby is a groupie for this series, so he is thrilled with it. Good quality, basic packaging, but full of everything he wanted."
2,Judge without a heart,"I think family court judges must lose some perspective about divorce and heartache after years of dealing out the final legal blow to a family. I understand they must be impartial, but for goodness sake, Ms Baker, show some mercy to those who don't WANT to get a divorce. Shouldn't there be some kind of incentive to keep families together? The title suggests that there is some softness in divorce (or at least in the book) but it is a very dry, legal and hopeless process for what to expect when you go through a divorce. Good for those who are going through the process without a lawyer (or with a lawyer who doesn't explain the process) but not at all what I expected based on the title."
1,"replacement filters from ""4 My Pets""","WARNING! the filters that this vendor is selling are NOT ""Drinkwell Replacement Filters."" Instead, the vendor sends off-brand aquarium filters. My order was over a week late, and never did I hear from the vendor regarding the switch...indeed, my receipt listed the filters as being ""Drinkwell"" filters, but in fact they were not. Do be careful ordering from this vendor!"
4,pretty good!!,I agree with the person who wrote how it's not your average chick lit but how it's darker.At first it's a slow read but the last 150 pages were very good.It was hard to put the book down!Loved how it's not the practical story about an overweight woman who tries to lose weight but instead learns to love herself for the way she is.
3,Mixed feelings,"I really disliked the character of Candace ""Cannie"" Shapiro, but I was impressed with Jennifer Weiner's writing. Her writing is sharp, witty, clear, precise and even the dialog is very good. That said, I could care less about the tale, and though I know Jennifer Weiner fought to portray Cannie the way she saw her, she should have listened to her editors and naysayers. Her Cannie is whiny, loud, shameless, pathetic, groveling. Of course, you had to stretch reality to make anyone think Cannie could be loveable. Her mouthiness at the doctor's office was obscene, and the doctor's subsequent crush lacked even a modicum of credibility. The whole make your screenplay thing was laughable."
4,Threecats,"The book started out a little more intriguing and leveled off. I liked the idea of an overweight character taking control of her life, but didn't like the way she wanted her lame boyfriend back. I would suggest it to some of my friends tho."
4,Could not put this book down!,"I am never disappointed by a Weiner book, the ending was a bit cheesy but other than that I loved it."
3,No excitment,"The best things about this book is the character. Cannie was a great character and very real. Other than her, the book was kind of boring. It had long boring narration that seemed to have nothing to do with anything. At times the plot died and I just wanted the book to be over. I only rated it okay because Cannie was a great character."
4,Felt real,"Weiner is known for her ""plus-sized girls can have happy endings too"" books, but the first one of hers I read (Goodnight Nobody) wore me out with the main character's constant whinging about her thighs. Wore me out enough that I waited over three years before I read another. Thankfully, I liked Cannie much much more. Cannie's thoughts and feelings and actions felt more authentic. The book takes a couple of big turns that I definitely wasn't expecting. I didn't even see the love interest coming! Overall, I enjoyed this and won't wait so long this time to read another novel by Weiner."
5,A book with it all!,"What a wonderful, easy, and entertaining read. This book brings you through everything - living, learning, loving, and then passing it all on. I found myself feeling exactly like the main character did in certain scenes, but then wanted to smack her and tell her to ""smartin' up"" in others! Parts of this book made me laugh so hard that I woke up my husband.Most of my reading is done at the end of a busy day and brain doesn't want to work too hard! I spent 3 nights in a row, up until 2 a.m. reading this book. I didn't not want to put it down. I loved it!"
3,Fat gal fairy tale,"What started off as a promising, poignant and funny novel falls apart halfway through when Cannie makes her rather implausible Hollywood connection and finds out she's pregnant. Her friendship with starlet-...fairy godmother Maxi is bordering on ridiculous,and her post-partum breakdown is just plain irritating and poorly rendered.That said, ""Good in Bed"" was still a decent read; it pulls you in and won't let you go. For all of its minor irritations, I do think the mark of a good story is one that keeps you reading, and this novel delivers on that score. It's also much more likeable than several of the other vacuous novels spawned by Helen Fielding's ""Bridget Jones."""
2,Annoying!,"The main character, Cannie is annoying with her blame-the-world outlook on life. I couldn't relate to her negativity because I never found her to be a ""loser"" to warrant that kind of attitude. If she was a friend of mine, I would slap her and tell her (1) SNAP OUT OF IT (2) portion control (3) stop whining (4) find a new therapist.Cannie hung on to all the bad things in her life but failed to appreciate all the good things she had right on front of her. Clich storyline. And I didn't find her funny at all either.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed in this book. It felt as if the first half of the book was written by a different author than the second half. It was as if I was reading two different books.
1,"Self-conscious, narcissistic, trite, boring dribble.","I hated this book and probably am not qualified to write a review because I stopped reading this piece of garbage 100 pages into it. I found Cannie to be incredibly annoying, complaining about everything and taking no responsibility for her unhappiness. Any 28 year old still complaining about their childhood deserves to be alone and miserable. I knew this book was autobiographical (and then verified it on Ms. Weiner's website), which is something that I can't stand-memoir masked as fiction. I really couldn't stand this book and cannot believe it was a bestseller. I don't really read much modern fiction and tend to stick to the classics; books like this are the reason why."
3,Starts well enough then...meh,"I really liked the first half of this book. Funny, entertaining, intersting -- if only it could have sustained those qualities for me.I assume I may be in the minority here (and that's fine), but I really had problems with the book after a certain point. I stopped being sympathetic towards the main character and starting rolling my eyes at her. Cringing at her 'poor woman-scorned' attitude. What started out unique and original turned stereotypical and melodramatic. For me, it became less about an independent woman making a way for herself and more about blaming others (men) for all her problems and life situations. It came off sort of like a bad Lifetime movie.The actual ending was better than I was expecting, but at that point, I really didn't care because unfortunately, I didn't even like Cannie anymore."
4,Very cute book!,"I really enjoyed this novel. Aside from the minor complaint that it was slow in a few places, and the author skipped back and forth in time in a way that was occasionally confusing, the story was very cute. The heroine, Cannie, was both real and likeable, and I was rooting for her the entire way through. It was a great book to curl up with on a cold afternoon! If you like books like Bridget Jones Diary and My Life on a Plate you'll really like this one."
4,I was laughing and in horror.,"I loved this book, but my friend hated it. She found it too good...I found it great and I felt as if I could bond with the character's struggle with weight. There is one of the characters in this book I wanted to beat up... the character that thought up the title. Read it and find out who that character is!"
5,A great reading pleasure,"I used to love to read for pleasure as a child, but as an adult I am so serious about reading. It is always so much non fiction. This was something fun that could really hold my attention. It is good just like her other book in her shoes. That one came out in movie form, but the books are so much better. Yeah watch the movies too, but only after the books if you like to read. These books are so much fun to read. She has a great writing style that is really fun. These are really good books for adult women to read. I would highly recomend these books they really held my attention."
3,Entertaining.,"I chose this book because of a review I read in my local newspaper, the author grew up in a town near my own, so it sparked my interest. After reading the spotlight on Jennifer Weiner in my newspaper, it was difficult not to compare her main character, Cannie, to her. I had some difficulty getting into the book, but midway through, I couldn't put it down. Cannie became almost like a friend- she reminded me of some of my own friends! Overall, I liked ""Good In Bed""-it is a good travel companion/beach book."
5,Wish I didn't finish it so fast...I wanted to keep reading,"This ranks right up there as one of the best books I've ever read! I expected a pretty light beach-book read, but it is so much more than that. I laughed, and cried, and was sad when I finished it. I can't wait for Jennifer Weiner's next one!"
1,not such a loveable character....,"I think this had the *potential* to become a really good book about what overweight women go through every day and having the grace and strength to overcome, but it just doesn't cut it. Cannie is such a funny character, but most of the book is just ridiculous and it doesn't do her justice. Instead of overcoming her obstacles and being a stronger person for it, everything is done *for* her by her family and her ""celebrity"" friend. I just think this book would have been a lot better if she learned how to trust and take care of herself instead of having a doctor boyfriend and her rich friend solve everything in the end. Another thing that *really* bothers me in the book is how Cannie thinks she has the right to decide whether or not her baby's father can be part of her life just because *she* had a bad relationship with him in the end. That is not personal growth."
1,WHY has this book received so much praise??? It's awful!,"This book isn't even worth writing an in-depth review on, because its stupidity can be summed up in a few sentences. It's absolutely horrible! The writing is mediocre at best, the storyline is predictable, Cannie's character is shallow and whiney, and the whole scenario of, ""girl writes screenplay, girl coincidentally meets the biggest actress in Hollywood and they become best friends, actress loves girl's screenplay, screenplay is bought and girl becomes filthy rich"", is completely lame. Everything about ""Good in Bed"" was unbelievable. Don't be misled by other reviews saying the writing was ""witty""...it was about as witty as my left foot. Was Jennifer Weiner trying to write a novel or a sitcom? Dumb, dumb, dumb. If you still feel the need to buy this book, be sure to get it used so you can save money."
1,"horrible...annoying, self pitying and homophobic","Possibly the worst book I've ever read. Annoying, self-absorbed dreck. Hated, hated, hated the main character -- she is a whiny, immature idiot. The portrayal of her mother and partner was totally stupid. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Not My Favorite...,"It was an easy read, good in the begining, but I felt a let down in the end. Parts of it were hard to believe and somewhat cheesy. Not one of Jennifer's best."
4,Great summer read,"I was looking for a good book to read by the pool, and this proved to be a very good choice. I really enjoyed the character and the writer's style . I could not put this book down, and I will definately look for this author's work agian when choosing a new book."
4,Fun Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! Broken into five parts (Good in Bed, Reconsider Me, I Go Swimming, Suzie Lightning and Joy), Ms. Weiner takes her readers through a year or so of Cannie Shapiro's life. As she goes through love, loss and change, I found myself connecting with her and being able to relate to her emotions in many ways.Other reviews have done an excellent job of outlining the plot, so I keep this brief and just encourage you to give this book a chance. It's a fun read but not a no-brainer. It will make you think and reflect on decisions you have made, people in your life and about what your future might unexpectedly hold...."
2,What's all the hype about??,"It amazes me that this is a popular read. I am an easy to please reader who is rarely critical. But, this book bored me to death. It has a great beginning -- and so much potential. However, I soon felt like Cannie was somewhat obnoxious and always complaining. I decided i didn't like her when I hit part about the first group meeting at the doctor's office (page 70)makes a complete fool out of the poor nurse. Yeah, the nurse was going over calorie control, protein and fiber portions, etc... and yeah, most of these women were very familiar with all that. But, she had to start off with the basics. All Canie had to do was say something. instead, she completely disrespects the nurse and turns all the group members against her. And thinks it's funny when the woman becomes frustrated and runs out of the room. There's a fine line between an amusing, slightly melodramatic character and a self absorbed, obnoxious one."
2,Almost Good in Bed,"I wanted very much to like this book and partly because I liked the main character. But, I found myself skimming through it following one unbelievable coincidence after another. The writing is clever and funny, but most of the characters are flat stereotypes, particularly the diet doctor and the movie star friend. And the pregnancy, I felt like I was reading a treatment for a television sitcom. This book seemed like it was a learning exercise for a writer with real potential to mine the depths of serious issues through comedy. I hope she doesn't get swallowed up by the publishing industry."
1,SKIP for SPOILERS AHEAD!,"Ok, I absolutely loved this book up to a certain point which I will get to in a moment. I loved Cassie's attitude, her humour, her distress over her ex-boyfriend Bruce, etc... until she finds out...she's pregnant. UGH! Being blissfully child-free, I thought by making Cassie pregnant, completely ruined the book. She turned into this awful human being that I couldn't stand. It took every power of my being to finish the crappy second half of this book. Why do authors ruin books by making the lead characters pregnant?????? So disappointing. I'm so glad I got this book out of the library so no money was wasted on it. And before I get any hateful comments, I don't dislike children. I actually love them, just don't want to have them nor feel that every relationship story has to have them included in the storyline to make a happy relationship successful."
5,Jennifer Weiner is my new favorite writer,"I'll admit, I found the title of this book questionable before I read it--and it raised a few eyebrows when I had it sitting on my coffee table! Little did I know what an incredibly funny and touching story it represented. Jennifer Weiner knows what it's like to be one of the girls, and brings that across like nobody else--reading one of her books is like having a conversation with your best friend. This story is a winner from beginning to end."
4,Enjoyable,"Good in Bed is an enjoyable, easy read with a sassy main character (Cannie). Some aspects seemed to be borrowed from Bridget Jones, Julia Roberts, and Sex in the City. But it was entertaining anyway, waiting to see how things would work out for Cannie."
4,"Great Start, But I Wanted More","I love Cannie Shapiro, and I loved her life for the first half of this book. She faces the challenges of her life with real humor and outrage. She's got wonderfully colorful and fascinating friends, co-workers, and relatives. I just wished she'd stayed in Philadelphia and faced her life as she was living it. Instead -- and without giving away any of the events of the second half -- she goes out of town where Stuff Happens. The rest of the book felt too much like a fantasy Cannie might have about how her life could take several surprising turns. I finished the book feeling like my heart strings had been tugged a bit too mechanically. My advice to Ms. Weiner: Your characters' lives are well worth reading about right here in Philadelphia simply because they are YOUR characters, which means they have a great perspective on things. Keep `em at home!"
3,Somewhere in the middle between good and bad,"I started our loving this book b/c Cannie calls Philadelphia home much like myself and the author writes the book so that I can picture exactly where Cannie is walking, eating, etc. The beginning of the book was also good b/c Cannie's adventures were very believable and made me want to keep flipping. Then I hit the middle of the book, and I still kept flipping b/c I was waiting for it to reach the good part again. Except I ran out of pages to flip and was left feeling unfulfilled by the last half of the book. Being a somewhat full figured woman(a size 16 myself, so I took offense on the fact that this size was considered extremely obese when I myself am quite in shape), I found Cannie's low self-esteem and slide into self-pity to be quite annoying. I kept wanting to yell at her to get herself together and realize how much she had going for her. I was disappointed that a character that started out strong, ended up being a whiny, annoying girl."
2,Insults the intelligence of intelligent women,"I was eager to read this book, as I think that full-figured women are underrepresented in most of the popular arts, fiction included. It's nice that Jennifer Weiner's heroine, Cannie, is a strong and confident woman despite being ""over""weight.But in addition to being strong and confident, she's superficial, intellectually insipid and has the cultural tastes of a 15-year-old girl. Her emotional responses are predictable and housewife-ish; her star-struck ""Hollywood"" adventures are the stuff of Tigerbeat. The plot is aimless and disappointing, and the ending has absolutely no surprises. This book is for women who love watching Oprah and The View. So I guess if you're a fan of both those shows, you'll like this book. I thought it sucked."
2,Weak entry in a strong genre,"There are so many wonderful books out there about confused 30ish urban women. This isn't one of them. It seems as if the author couldn't decide whether she wanted to be of the fun-and-clever Helen Fielding (""Bridget Jones"") or more somber-and-literary Alice Hoffman (""The River King"") ilk. She missed in both directions.If you're looking for light and love-oriented, try Jane Green's ""Jemima J"" or Jenny Colgan's ""Amanda's Wedding"". For a deeper read, try Barbara Kingsolver or Melissa Bank or Anita Shreve. Nick Hornby, Marian Keyes, Robert Hellenga, Alison Lurie...This one might be Good in Theory. In reality, it's just mediocre."
2,Good in Bed,"""Good in Bed"" sounds like something everyone wants and wants to be. Too bad you will be disappointed with this book. It starts out well enough. But somewhere in the middle of the whining about her weight and inability to cope with her family, I just lost interest. I did make myself finish the book. I am always hopeful that things will improve. I feel things in this book went from bad to worst. Maybe it's the self-defeating attitude ""feel sorry for me I'm fat"". Or the way no one in her office doesn't the fantastic job she does and yet she is given little credit. I just thought it was more like self-loathing instead of pulling herself up by the boot straps and making a better life. Instead she is unrealistically suspended until her fantasy friend appears to make her life better. I noticed how her fantasy man appears interested in her after she loses weight. This book is a romantic novel in disguise"
5,A Must Read!,"Having just finished Jemima J I was less than anxious to read anything else that featured a ""larger"" heroine. I figured that it too would be trite and stereotypical about the perspective that we have on the world. I couldn't have been more wrong. Cannie is a strong, independent woman, who like everyone, has her baggage and insecurities but gets through it with her intelligence and sense of humor. I couldn't put this book down. I can't wait to read more from this author, who has the unique ability to combine reality and fantasy. There are elements of the book where Cannie gets to live out the life we wish we all had but that culminates with dashes of reality and parallels to my own life that make this book even more poignant."
1,"lazy, predictable writing","Another example of how just about anything that creates momentum through lowest common denominator readers and good publicity can become a best seller. Bad, rambling writing, irritating, one-dimensional characters, plots stretched to the absolute limits of believability, and predictability so gross that almost every page has a ""I feel like I could have written that"" quality to it."
2,This is the last Jennifer Weiner novel I will read,"This is the second Jennifer Weiner novel I read, and it will be the last. I think I've pinpointed what I disliked so much about both of these books; the main characters spend the first 150-200 pages doing nothing but whining (and the first half of the book bores me to tears). And then miraculously something happens that is completely out of the ordinary. I just hate whiny main characters. Both books I've read have an overweight main character, and especially in Good In Bed, she complains about it constantly. I just don't enjoy reading about that. I didn't give it a one star because I was able to finish it and the ending was somewhat cute."
3,Good but not THAT good,"I was suprised at the amount of self doubt, and sadness that was in this book. Perhaps because I had just finished Can You keep a Secret, which was lighthearted the entire way through. This was however a good book, and amusing, but it had quite a dark turn towards the end, RIGHT after I thought things were looking up. So if you want a dramatic novel, a bit on the dark side as well, that somehow manages to be funny as well, this is the book for you."
3,"Okay, but not great","Parts of this book had me laughing out loud, but for the most part, it was totally unrealistic. I felt like I was watching a movie since Cannie's life became totally predictable, and every little piece of her life fell magically into place. About 2/3 of this book could have been omitted and is just boring, such as when she keeps moaning about breaking up with her loser boyfriend. Or how life was totally cruel by giving her a premature baby.....it just went on and on. Other than that, it was a cute story and an easy fluff read. Weiner makes you feel sympathetic toward Cannie and has you wishing her the best throughout the book."
2,A Little Cliche,"Perhaps a better title for this book might have been ""A Supersize Cinderella story"". Although the main character, Cannie, starts off to be fairly likeable, witty, sharp, (though self-loathing and hyper critical), I had a little trouble believing the strange turn of events which started around the time she threw herself at her grieving ex. For me, the characters all seemed a little cliche and flat and the plot somewhat predictable and soap opera-ish--with Cannie getting the real ""prince charming"" in the end (not to mention the fulfillment of every woman's fantasies: wealth, generous celebrity friends, a huge career boost, etc). I also found Cannie's constant obsession with her ex to be beyond annoying. C'mon, ladies! Is this woman for real? Despite all that, I do think Ms. Wiener is a talented writer and would like to see her move beyond this self-indulgent (and rather limited) Chick-Lit genre."
1,not what I thought,"I usually check out the ""Customers who bought this list"" to find things similar to books I have read and like. This is nothing like any of the oother books on that liskt other than it si about a women. It was horribly depressing and the ending didn't make up for the sadness of the rest of the book. I had a couple of cute parts but not enough for me to suggest it. I love Jane Greene and this is nothing like any of her books.(thank god I bought it on sale)"
3,"Good story, but pretty long-winded","This was a good chick-lit book, but I felt certain details of the story tended to be repeated over and over."
4,A nice change,"I don't generally read books like this. But after reading the first few pages, I was hooked. Parts of the story were a little far fetched for me, but other parts of it I could relate to and could feel the humiliation, pain, and happiness that Cannie felt.All in all, I was very pleased with this book. I recommend reading it, especially if you're wanting a change of genre."
2,It's fine....,I feel like the main character was much too selfish. It was all about her and feeling sorry for herself. She dumps her boyfriend but he's the bad guy? She wants everyone to feel sorry for her. Get over yourself! She does NOTHING for anyone else in the entire book.
1,Not even worthwhile as brain candy,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read! Because of all the hype about it by reviewers from women's magazines, I foolishly paid for and read a full-priced book that was half-baked. The plot was RIDICULOUS and the main character was as shallow as the men she mocks. She whines and complains about herself and her situation and comes off more as pathetic than sympathetic. Hopefully, larger sized women don't read this book thinking it's a some kind of a ""girl power"" book when all the character succeeds in is coming off as a loser. Please tell me that an author will come along one day and actually write a book about a confident woman who happens to be larger (and not about a larger woman who one day happens to be confident)."
4,fun and fast-paced!,"I really enjoyed this novel. Weiner has an intelligent, but not too serious writing style that makes this book fun to read, and not too much of a guitly pleasure. Although I enjoyed this novel, and recommend it, I was frustrated by the focus on Cannie's weight issues and felt that it trivialized the issues and problems she was experiencing."
5,ABSOLUTELY... LOVED THIS BOOK!!,"What a fantastic book! Very funny, yet I was truly moved by the myriad of emotions Cannie experienced throughout. I'm shopping right now for new books by Jennifer Weiner."
5,Chick lit with heart,"Finally someone has got it right. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this book. As a woman who does not fit into society's ""thin is in"" mold, this book struck a resounding chord. The heroine, Cannie, is a breath of fresh air. Good in bed brought forth laughter, tears, and even an understanding on why some men can't deal with dating an overweight woman. You will laugh out loud at the lengths some women will go to reach society's standards. Cannie's non-traditional family, her ex-boyfriend, and her ""fat doctor"" round out a cast of wonderfully written characters. Read this book, enjoy it, and pass it on to a friend."
4,A breath of fresh Air,"It is hard to describe this book without sharing all the twists and turns. It is about ex-boyfriends, love, hollywood and real life. This was book had many sub-plots and was very entertaining. I was shocked by the price a little high for paperback. Check out 'In her Shoes'great book!"
1,Yargh!,"I literally threw this book across the room. What a waste of time and money. I'd elaborate, but now I have to go outside and set my copy on fire."
1,The Most Vapid Book I've Ever Read,"I had to read ""Good in Bed"" for a book club meeting. WOW... if this is the kind of book that gets published, I'm doing something really wrong!"
2,So Disappointing,"I bought this after laughing out loud a few times in the first chapter, usually a good sign. Unfortunately, while I wanted very much to like this book, the silliness of the plot kept subverting Weiner's otherwise enjoyable writing. The Hollywood twist was an unbelievable, Wayne's World-esque fantasy; the crisis resulting form her fling with Bruce was made-for-TV unoriginal and melodramatic; and the climax with Bruce, his new girlfriend, and Cannie's meltdown was just too much for the book handle. I wish Weiner had characterized a more normal day-to-day life for Cannie - I think she'd have done a great job of it and it would have been more illuminating. Most irritating thing: I wish Cannie had actually said more funny things as opposed to reporting constantly that other people say she's funny."
1,Dont waste your time!,"This was one of the worst books I could have laid my eyes on! After hearing what a good author Jennifer is, it is hard to believe it after reading the first few chapters of this book. Boring and the character seems pathetic! Maybe good for people who are having major weight issues...."
2,First book was better,"Weiner's first book was fantastic. This book didn't even come close. The characters were unbelieveable and underdevleoped, the plot boring and predictable. It was so terrible I would rather have a tooth pulled than read it. So I got to page 147 and couldn't take it anymore. Weiner, you have a lot of writing talent but this one was a bomb."
2,give me a break,"This book should be sold along with what other kids in junior high are reading. Ms. Weiner apparantly forgot to consult an editor before they published this book. The plot is so predicable and the writing so wordy. Do we need to hear the description of every last detail? I assure you, the adult audience you intended this book for as an imagination. And Cannie, get over the fact that your father left you already.Take my advice, leave this book for the children graduating from Judy Blume."
3,not so good,"I was told this would be a great book. ""Its just like Jane Green's books"". not really. i found this book boring. i didnt even finish it. i suppose it gets better as you go on but I cant gain any interest in it to continue. The Dominant Blonde is much better. read that."
1,Boring,What a boring drawn-out read. I abandoned it after about 80 pages. I purchased the book because of its very high ratings but sorry to say I was very disappointed.
1,Just can't get into it,"After seeing the high reviews the book has received, I really expected to like it. However, I purchased it about 4 months ago, and I'm still only about 1/3 into it. It's slow and boring and the main character is about as interesting and likeable as a paper plate. Jennifer Weiner has failed miserably at drawing me in. I can't even feel sorry for Cannie for what her ex wrote about her because I couldn't see it as nearly as bad as I suppose Weiner intended it to be-- and I'm a plus-sized chic myself! I want to finish this book just to get my money's worth, but at this rate, it will be Halloween before I'm done."
2,Problems with the Kindle edition,"This is not so much a review on the content of the book - as the people that have gone before have said, the content of this novel is fabulous. However, the Kindle edition needs major editing. Serious, serious editing. The punctuation errors - missing and misplaced punctuation, quotation marks, and misplaced words - made it hard to get through the book. Also a fair amount of typo-like spelling errors. Amazon should take another look at this edition and make it less distracting to loyal Kindle users like me."
3,"Good, not great","I have always heard great things about Jennifer Weiner, and was excited to dig into this book. I was a little disappointed, as it wasn't as funny as I would have liked. It was more fluffy than I would have expected. I wanted Cannie to be a stronger, more independent woman - her attempts to reunite with her hippie boyfriend who really was not good enough for her stank of desperation. I do find it charming that Weiner is writing about things she knows about - facing bias and prejudice for being an overweight woman, life in Philadelphia, PA, etc. But, if you are looking for a funny, smart book with a takeaway, you can move right along - it just isn't here."
5,"This book is ""Good in Bed""",Very funny and very hard to put down. I spent many nights reading in my bed not being able to put it down. I highly recommend it!
4,WONDERFUL!!!,"This is the first Jennifer Weiner book I've read, but I will definitely read more of hers! Cannie is a wonderful ""true"" woman with qualities and life time experiences we can all relate to. This is a romance novel that could be a true life scenario. A bit of a tear jerker with a VERY satisfying end. ENJOY!"
4,REALLY Good In Bed,I've heard some bad reviews about this book. Some said it was predictable and unreal. In my opinion this book approaches life just the way it is. Sometimes it's predictable and other times it's unreal. I loved the book because it was totally real and gave me (a plus sized girl) a little hope for something a little challanging and a little unexpected. Thanks Jennifer Weiner!
5,Close to Home,"I couldn't put this book down either...not even amid the stares of my fellow train passengers as I sat, half crying, half laughing my way through the book. I felt as if I was a part of the story, as if Cannie was a close friend, or even myself. The setting in Philadelphia may not be as close to home for others, but I'm surrounded by the places mentioned in the book and that made me feel even more a part of the story. I loved Cannie's sarcastic wit, which is what prompted me to buy it in the bookstore. I picked it up and flipped through a few pages, and I laughed at almost every snippet I read, and that sealed the deal. I'm already recommending it to my friends, and ready to start on it a second time."
4,awesome.,"I work as a bookseller at Barnes and Noble, and I have never been a big fan of ""chick lit"" but I have loved this book since it came out. Cannie's struggle to overcome what has been thrown at her is inspiring and this book makes me laugh out loud and choke up. Highly reccomended."
1,Please explain this book's charms?,"The only good thing about this book is that it makes me think I can quit my full-time job and write fiction novels, because apparently people will read anything. The main character is completely miserable. I also don't like the way she disparages against her mother's partner (and her mother), it borders on lesbian-bashing. I wouldn't be able to recommend this book to anyone other than to have them read it to see how even such poorly written material can do well these days. This book is a definite skip."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book is not for anyone with self esteem issues. The main character Cannie is a co-dependent being. The author never allows the main character to find self without out a man,family member or friend.Cannie is made out to be an indiviudual that never comes to grips with who she is and never learns to stand on her own 2 feet or even love herself.There are some high points to this novel, but as a whole, I was thoroughly disappointed."
3,is good in bed really a good read????,"the amazon.com reviews of this book were so high that i struggled to not feel disappointed reading this book. i will admit if you can get through the first 2/3 rds, it has some rewarding moments. the story is half-fantasy, half-reality, but more fantasy. i wished it would have been one or the other. the book is based on the main character Cannie's ex-boyfriends column . Neither one really get delved into. It's only in the last third did I really have any compassion for her, but when those moments arrive they hit like a truck. The book is lengthy and I felt that there were areas of the story that weren't developed fully, but to mention them would give the whole story away. It's an easy read and you will laugh out loud a number of times, just don't expect a perfect story or how to learn to be good in bed."
5,it'll tickle your funny bone and touch your heart too,"I totally adore this book. The story hits the ground running right away, so you'll be sucked into it in no time! Cannie is one of the most believable women I've come across in a long time. Most of us women deal with body image issues no matter what size we are, so we can really relate to Cannie's insecurities and doubts. The author also portrays the other characters very well. I read this book in only a few days! (If I was on vacation I probably would have finished it in a day.) Trust me, women won't be able to put this book down. I'm not sure if guys would like this book, but women definitely will. Women ~ enjoy! Go out and get it!!"
5,Bravo,"Bravo and thank you Jennifer for bringing Cannie into life. ""Good in Bed"" caught my eyes in an Athens bookstore. I stood at the shelf and started reading the first chapter, then I sat on the floor and kept reading until the store clerk told me they were closing. I bought the book and didn't put it down the whole night and the next morning, until I got out of the train and sat on the bench in the metro to finish the last 7 pages before I'd go to the office.I can't find the right words to describe the thrill and satisfaction this book brings to a reader. I took an unforgettable journey with Cannie to her workplace, to her doctor and her friends and family, to the streets of Philadelphia, to her thoughts and fears, to her memories and not even once I found myself bored or uninterested."
5,If you've ever struggled with a weight problem.......,"If you've ever had a negative self-image due to some extra pounds, you simply must read this book!! After declaring ""Watermelon"" as my all time favorite read for years, ""Good In Bed"" is my new favorite contemporary fiction novel.Weiner develops the character of ""Cannie"" marvelously. She struggles to accept her lesbian mother's lifestyle, get over her pot smoking ex-boyfriend, and rise above a hypocritical, absent father. The thing that I liked most about ""Good In Bed"" is the many surprises that Weiner weaves into the story. This is not your average, predictable ""girl searches for boy"" story. There are several incidents that will make your heart ache, and many more that will make you laugh out loud!I did not want this book to end!! It truly impacted my own self-image. I am so looking forward to this author's next work."
5,Yay!,"What a delight. Yes, there are some bitter moments, but the way the book alternates between hard-won insight, humor, anger, and triumph reminds me of the use of dynamics in classical music. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, this debut novel has the empathy and charm of Maupin, the insight of Updike, the touch of the absurd from Vonnegut and the passion of, well, Weiner. Nice to have all that in the guise of a beach book. This book is simply a joy, on many levels.Hopefully this will end up as a film, where it could end up as something along the lines of Working Girl (the Melanie Griffith movie) as directed by the Hairspray-era John Waters.I also recommend her tour diary from the ... website. Perhaps the publisher will see fit to include it in the paperback edition."
2,Trapped by its own genre,"Bridget Jones pulled it off - and she remains the queen of chick lit. This book fits comfortably in the same genre; however, when the author tries to become more ""serious"" and gives her heroine a ""psycotic"" adventure, it becomes almost too painful to continue reading...The first part of the story is the most engaging - and the most clever. The periodic columns written by her ex-boyfriend works quite well in driving the story forward; however, after they cease to exist, the hum-drum starts. After the ""reunion"" with the uber-mean father figure, the plot skids downhill. Finally, the ending just keeps going and going - a more over-the-top finale is hard to imagine (did she perhaps just die and go to paradise?)A decent book for the beach, which the author probably was aiming for in the first place :)"
1,Author makes unforgivable mistake ...,"A pleasant-enough read until about halfway through, when Weiner FORGETS she has told us on page 3 that Cannie was imitating her mother's life partner, Tanya (also spelled Tayna in this poorly edited novel) when she first meets Bruce. Later, she tells us she and Bruce were dating the day she is devastated by the news that her mother is gay and that the woman who's been living with her is, in fact, more than just a friend. If the author didn't care enough about Cannie to get the details of her life right, why should we? Sloppily written and lazily edited; a complete disappointment."
1,Depressing Read,"I was looking for a good ""beach"" read, and thought this was the one. However, the main character is so depressing, and so self-deprecating, I am sorry I bought this book. Cannie is a self fulfilling prophecy with her laments about her weight issues, her disturbed childhood, her boyfriend problems, and her lesbian mother. I was very disappointed in this work, which surprised me as I enjoyed In Her Shoes. It's a depressing read, and I'm only on page 100. I'm putting it down and selling it to a used book store."
3,Not as good as I had thought it would be,"I was very disappointed in this book. It wasn't anyhting like I had expected. Maybe its just because I am all about happy, hilarious books that aren't depressing, and this book was not only depressing, it was in some parts totally unrealistic. Poor Cannie couldn't seem to catch a break, and yeah everything ended up okay, but only after a string of heartbreaking events. Why was she so stuck up on an ugly, immature, pot head ex-boyfriend that she broke up with? I didn't get it. I just couldn't relate at all. Being heavy set, I though I could relate. Boy was I wrong!"
2,Too much self pity,I was expecting a light-hearted romance and instead found a main character that was so depressing I could hardly get through the book. It was pitiful how the character kept deliberatly defeating herself only to finish strong in the end. I had a hard time getting involved.
2,Not that great...,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who described it as hysterical and an easy read. At least the later was true. Although the main character has a good sense of humor and whit about her, the story itself is tragic and depressing. I just kept waiting for this book to end! Although some great things happen to her, I think the awful things she comes across are too mournful to make the good things count for much. I will not be reading the sequel and recommend this book only to those in search of a story about the cruelties of life. I give it two stars because it was a quick and easy read and well written. I just did not enjoy the plot."
5,Very good read!,I loved this book. I thought it was light and humorous. I loaned it to my Aunt to read next because it was so good. I just bought the next book called Certain Girls and I am excited to read it.
5,Smashing!!!,"I loved this book! I read a lot of chick lit and this book is at the top of my list of ""must reads."" Cannie was someone that I grew to care about and couldn't wait to find out what was next for her-a real page turner. I loved the little-well, maybe major, surprises the author threw in to keep you interested. More than once I found myself saying, ""Wow, I didn't see that coming!!"" Don't miss it!"
4,If you love real life nuances...you'll love this...,"Although this book had a somewhat slow start, I found it to be funny, interesting and eventually hard to put down. The real-life experiences are hillarious and so right on target that it sometimes reminded me of my own life. It was a full circle of love, loss, love and self-awareness healing. Cannie is a down-to-earth character that embodies traits of every single young woman looking for love while dealing with self-acceptance issues and body image stereotypes. When she truly finds love it's right in front of her eyes and she ignors it - shoos it away and slams the door on it. What makes this book so good is that the author, Jennifer Weiner, doesn't reveal the ending within the story. I love to read a book without knowing how it will end. Some stories you can tell by the 3rd chapter or half way through, but not this one, it keeps you hanging on til the end. I highly recommend it for fun summer reading!"
4,Great read for the beach this summer!!!,"Once I started to read this book I could not put it down. It is a ""feel good"" book that almost any woman can relate to."
2,not as good as I had hoped,"This book started out well, but lost its steam. I was disappointed by the slowness of the book and kept waiting for it to get better."
2,Too slick for its own good,"This is a very canny novel about a woman named Cannie (what a coincidence). And by ""canny"" I mean slickly tailored to the prevailing literary market: young woman in publishing flails comically through relationship (and weight) issues in today's crazy mixed-up urban world. Much of the time this reads exactly like a Hollywood movie treatment, in fact the excerpt provided here ... gives you a swell idea right off the bat. If this is your thing, and you don't mind frankly unbelievable twists like Cannie (a reporter) bonding deeply with a movie actress she's profiling (happens all the time, right?), then I can recommend this novel highly. If you want substance and real atmosphere in a book about women's problems ...."
2,Not Impressed,"I decided to read this book based on the good reviews here. Sad to say, I was not impressed with this book. It's Jemima J meets I don't know who!! The story line seemed so hokey, predictable and unbelieveable to me. At times you want to knock some sense into Cannie for not having the self-confidence that I know is somewhere inside of her. Maybe I was disallusioned as I began reading the book...because I never expected to be so depressed about it after I was finished with it!"
5,laugh out loud funny,"I actually laughed so much when reading parts of this book that I woke my husband (I read it all one night in bed because I couldn't put it down). The story is great, the character is great (so human) and the writing is great. I cannot wait for the next book to come out in paperback."
4,Enjoyable Quick Read,"Big or small, short or tall; you will be able to relate to the main character of this book Cannie Shapiro. Cannie, is a reporter for the Philadelphia Examiner who just recently wanted a break from her long term relationship with Bruce. Its very obvious that Cannie and Bruce have very different ideas of what a break is. Bruce decides to write an article about loving a larger woman based on his relationship with Cannie for a national magazine. Because of this article Cannie begins to question everything in her life. Will Cannie every be happy, find the right man, find the love she deserves? You will have to read Good In Bed to find out.This may have been the first book I've read by Jennifer Weiner, but it certainly won't be the last."
4,a good read,"I really liked this book. After reading some of the negative reviews on the Amazon postings all I have to say is this: This is a good entertainment read, I don't think it was meant as a guide to live your life by. Cannie is very lovable and gives a great point of view. I loved that it was real-to-life with Cannie not turning into a super-model thin character. I am glad I made this purchase and I laugh that some people take entertainment so seriously and bag on every issue presentable."
3,???,"I agree with the one reviewer. It started out great and funny, then ended up being sad and miserable. She was a plus size... then she became smaller. Then bigger again... I liked the man she got with at the end though. He was a great 3-D character. I honestly could not figure out if I liked this book or not. I know that there are books that I liked much better and some that I thought were much worse."
3,Good at first - But then I have issues,"My book club had a month where we would read books that we were ""ashamed to want to read"". That meant a month dedicated to chick-lit. We had heard that this was the most un-chick-lit book of the bunch and decided to give it a try.Let me say that that is chick-lit. Yes, there are some twists and turns and a life crisis, but overall this is the same old story. Amazingly good things keep happening to the heroine that would never occur in real life. In addition, horrible awful things happen that are not really explainable.Everyone keeps writing about how they love the heroine in this story. Honestly at first I totally related to her. She was strong and fun and honest, but after a while I just started to say ""get over yourself and move on"".I'm giving this book three stars for the first 200 pages. I thought it was fun for a while, then it just tried to get too deep."
3,Enjoyable but not stellar,"As someone who has had a weight problem I can relate really well to a lot of this book. It's got a certain realistic quality regarding overweight women that it seems is quite lacking in a lot of books.The plot is rather all over the place, and as the book is written in a humorous and lighthearted style it is a little jarring when some of the darker parts of the story come along.Overall it was an enjoyable read, though it's probably one of those books that I'll be able to re-read in six months because I'll have forgotten everything that happens."
2,Definitely a first novel,"""Good in Bed"" could have been so much better. It has some funny lines and a few less-than-earth-shattering insights. But it reads like the author did little more than detail her fantasies. Like in most fantasies, dreams and daydreams, there are no logical, believable connections between Point A and Point B -- the instant movie-star friendship, for example. And, also, much of the ex-boyfriend's writing that Cannie (thus, the author) mocks as amateurish and superficial isn't really any worse than the author's own. The premise is great; I wish Weiner would have written it five to 10 years from now or at least had a better editor."
3,Disappointed,"Cannie starts out as an interesting character. The ex-girlfriend who is now public fodder for her ex-boyfriend's magazine column. The story could have been about Cannie's examination of her own issues, as well as the ex's. Instead, she's the selfish harpy brat. Ex-boyfriend's dad dies? Use the funeral to try and get back together with him by doing the deed with him that day! Of course, she gets knocked up. So she (subtly) tries to use the pregnancy to try and lure him back to her!Meanwhile, she steps all over her family and friends, and ignores the kindness and obvious interest of a terrific guy. She gets the Cinderella treatment from her Fairy Movie Star, takes away her ex's column, and whines all the way to the bank. Of course, Dr. Charming sticks around despite her being a grating, clueless, selfish jerk, and wins her ""heart"".Cannie a plus-size heroine? No, just a big fat brat."
2,Extreme Wish Fulfillment,"I picked this up at the Salvation Army. I enjoyed this book at first. Ultimately, however, I agree with the reviewer who said ""the heroine remains self-centered, self-pitying, immature, judgmental, condescending, elitist, and cruel throughout the whole book, and is repeatedly indulged by friends, loved ones, and [allowed] to dance through life without having to take responsibility for herself."" The only realistic part of this novel is the description of the verbally and emotionally abusive father - seems the heroine/author has adopted his voice without knowing it."
2,NEXT!!!!!!!,"Wow,the lesson I learned from purchasing and reading this book is- never assume that the New York Times bestsellers list is an accurate measure for a good read!Hyped as a great summer read, I looked forward to enjoying this book, however, instead of finding a story which could substantiate the media review raves, I read a girl meets boy-boy meets another girl-girl finds someone who really loves her predictable story, laced with cynical, self-abasing, slapstick humor. The continuous onslaught of big girl jokes made it hard to hang in there for the ""now I love myself just the way I am"" fairytale ending."
4,Why did it have to end??,I loved this book! The only reason I rated it short of five stars was because it ended to soon. I wanted to know what happened with Bruce and also Peter. It's an ideal book for any woman dealing with weight issues. I loved all the characters. Jennifer described them greatly. I'm hoping for a sequel to answer all the questions I have.
1,"If THIS is the best, what is the WORST???","I grabbed this book in between flights after a non-solicited suggestion in the airport. Wow, if this could be considered great, I can't imagine making it through the worst! The plot moved incredibly slow making every turn of a page painful. Cannie spends so much time sulking about a man who as described no other woman would appreciate much less, want. She does this (and complains about everything / everyone else in her life) without taking any responsibility or doing anything to improve herself or situation. A few big words are thrown in from time to time yet they do nothing to strengthen a weak, predictable yet completely unbelievable story line. Sadly, this book was a HUGE disappointment and the fact that I foolishly paid full price for it in the airport bookstore only heightens my annoyance.This was brutal and certainly NOT my idea of a good ""beach read"" - The only reason I made it to the end of the novel was the fact that I was stuck on a plane..."
2,Good in Bed,In Her Shoes was the first book I read by Jennifer Weiner so I thought I would read another book authored by Weiner. Good in Bed's character was a whinner and not very interesting. Didn't see the humor in any of the story and the book was wordy. Disappointing that this wasn't as good as In Her Shoes.
2,Maybe if I were on a beach....,"I'm sorry. I'm going to be the one who disagrees with everyone. This book annoyed me. Yes, I did end up finishing it...so something kept me reading it. I think I was always waiting for more complexity to these characters. I wanted to like them and I just didn't really care about anything they did. There was something so stereotyped about them.Just not my style of literature. It seems more like a very long non-fiction story from a women's magazine."
5,A great fast read.,I really enjoyed this book. Nothing too deep but a good story that keeps you interested. The author is very funny and I'm already looking forward to her next book.
5,Wonderful and funny,"I was in the book store just browsing when i can across the The New York Times Bestsellers table and there i found ""Good in Bed"". I read the back and though well this sounds good so i bought it. I didn't get to the book right away because i was in the middle of reading the Harry Potter's series. So when i finished up with Harry i started to read ""Good in Bed"". Well, i was hooked from the first chapter. Her characters were so real, genuine and funny. The main character ""Cannie"" is so much like every women i know. Insecure but not weak. Sometimes sad but still funny. Strong but in need of support. I would recommend this book to anyone that sees life for what it is. Someone who enjoys a quick, funny good read. Someone that can stand outside themselves and laugh with the best intentions."
3,A Great Start...,"I really enjoyed about the first half of this book - the character's razor sharp wit, and the ""real"" feeling of the story. I didn't like the ""fairytale"" qualities later on - suddenly rich, semi-famous, friend to celebrities, the perfect man pursuing her, ""getting back"" at the ex... it just became too sweet and perfect and something that NEVER happens to the average woman. I liked her better when she was fairly ordinary and everything wasn't falling so grandly into place."
2,I tried to like it,"I tried to enjoy this book but I found it irritating after a while. The narrator seems to have a real issue with vegetarians and she constantly takes pot-shots at them. (Her ex had the gall to be a vegetarian! A guest at her mom's Thanksgiving dinner had the nerve to eschew meat! A food critic is mad at vegetarians!) She seems to have some sort of ax to grind, and after the fourth shot was fired against vegetarians, I'd had enough and put the book down."
3,Definitely a book I wouldn't mind leaving behind at the airport,"Hey, not every book needs to be a new version of Hamlet or informative or wise or even a good story. So, if you're in the mood for filling time but not engaging your emotions or brains, go for it!"
3,Second half goes downhill....,"I think the first half of this book would be 4 stars, and the second half would be 2 stars, so I compromised with 3. The story hooks you in immediately and seems to set up a unique plot. The flashbacks to explain her relationship with Bruce and her family issues from childhood add some depth to the story and help develop Cannie's character. The book goes downhill fast after Cannie becomes best friends with ""Maxi,"" a famous actress she was trying to interview for a column. After this unconvincing friendship, the story becomes increasing ridiculous and unbelievable. The book was entertaining for the most part, but it was definitely frustrating toward the end. Worth reading if you are bored, but not a must-read."
3,"Uneven, and eventually disappointing","I am a guy who likes chick lit, and I even introduced my wife toBridget Jones's Diary (movie tie-in). I also have had my own share of struggles with weight, so I expected to enjoy (and relate to) Jennifer Weiner's book. However, after the fast and enjoyable start, the humor practically vanishes, and the book degenerates into a giant self-pity meltdown. Every once in a while, a hint of greatness glittered like gold dust in a stream, just enough to keep me reading until the end.I understand that childhood abandonment and emotional abuse can be scarring. I know the world can be frequently insensitive to those who do not conform to conventional appearance standards. But I also know that no person who behaves like the protagonist of 'Good in Bed' could possibly expect friend after friend to come through for them time after time. In a book like this, I expect to like main character, and I simply could not do it here."
1,Very disappointing,"I don't even know where to start with this review. Good in Bed was recommended to me by a friend, who thought that it was GREAT! and much better than Bridget Jones. I couldn't disagree more. The chick lit that I have read, Bridget and the shopoholic books, were better than this book by leaps and bounds. The writing is just plain bad. This book is in desperate need of a fantastic editor.As for the story, the character is not very likeable. When she spirals from ok to worse at the end, I wonder why postpartum depression is never mentioned. It seemed pretty obvious to me. Anyway, the character is a drama queen acting her worst.The only redeeming feature about this novel is that it did manage to make me weepy. Only, the more I cried, the more upset and angry at the author I became. I feel strongly that the book was not deserving of my tears."
2,Would you like some cheese with that whine?,"I'm trying to justify a 3star rating here. To put it mildly this was difficult to get through for me because I didn't fine Cannie (Lord I hate that name) sympathetic at all. For me Cannie was whiny and looking for someone to blame her lot in life on. Granted your formative years play into self esteem but at some point you are responsible for your own orgasms. I understood her ""plight"" but I didn't understand why the book was at least 85% wallowing and whining - I kept hoping this would change. I did however enjoy the snarky humor in the writing. The mechanics of the books also seemed to work but this was overall not a pleasant read for me. I also knew from early in the book exactly what the ending was going to be. Not a series I would continue."
4,poignant and addictive,"I highly recommend this book-- it's very feel-good and I enjoyed reading it, it's very emotional at times which can be difficult if you're an easy weeper, but on the whole very funny as well..."
5,Loved It! Simple as That!,"I won't belabor the plot points. You either suspend your disbelief or you don't. I, personally, had no trouble with the ""Maxi"" storyline - kind of fed all the right friendship fantasies for me, but maybe that says more about me than the book. I CAN tell you this: I picked up this book with absolutely no prior knowledge of it. The title intrigued me, as did the back cover. What I found far exceeded my expectations - a story about a full figured, real woman who has real relationships with men, with friends, with family. Like our own lives, the one we see here is imperfect, sometimes strong and sometimes frail, but always interesting. I loved this character and wished I knew her - she was the kind of person I could be friends with - and now she is, sort of, my friend. I'm keeping this book to re-read again and again."
4,Good read but unrealistic,"This is a fabulous read! It's funny, has identifiable characters (especially Cannie) and is really honest about the goings on inside the minds of large women. It's more like a dream of how larger women wish their lives could be than how it actually is for us most of the time though. Sure Cannie goes through some exceptionally rough patches, but overall her life is just too good to be true. That's what's great about it though."
4,"Funny, poignant and truly entertaining","Good In Bed hit the spot. The main character is very well written, with a mixture of gifts and flaws like the rest of us. The people around her, some more believable than others but still feel real. I was immediately drawn in by the story line and how it unfolded in front of me. She goes through the events in her life trying to keep a sense of humor, sometimes succeeding other times not. I was sorry when I finished the book, I wanted it to go on a little longer. It's a great summer read."
1,Hated it!,"After the first 50 pages, I was thoroughly bored! The heroine as well as other characters were all one dimensional. Can't believe all the great reviews! Please skip!!"
4,"Satisfying, enthralling, deliciously funny, thought-provoking","This was my first Jennifer Weiner book and I loved it. Read it in one go. Its listed as 'Chick-Lit' and it does have many satisfying elements of that genre - witty, romance, a lovable heroine that you can identify with. I'm a writer for newspaper and so i particularly enjoyed the sections from the Moxie articles - hilarious!But the book is so much more than 'just a romance'. The larger sized woman issues, the struggle with reconciling her childhood to her present, her journey to motherhood and eventual self discovery - all of these were written in a thoughtful and insightful way.If you're looking for an enjoyable read with some depth and lots of sarky wit - then this book is defn for you.I highly recommend it. Thank you Ms Weiner for a great read."
4,Smitten,"I am a Jennifer Weiner fan...and tend to enjoy reading all of her books. I like the twist and turns that this book leads down a normal life of a women. You lose a guy and think that you want him back...but, in reality if you were really into him, you wouldn't have lost him in the first place. It was a very pleasant book and I enjoyed it very much."
3,Ok for a beach read,"I liked the book, but didn't love it. I kept reading b/c I am from Phila and could relate to the Phila references. I liked Cannie and wanted to find out what happened to her, but I could not really relate, and didn't like the references to thin people as the enemy (maybe b/c I'm thin)! I think Jennifer is a good writer, but this just wasn't my favorite book."
1,Yawn,"I really wanted to like this book because it had been recommended to me by several people, but I just couldn't get into it. I was a little annoyed by Cannie's character who is pretty immature. But mostly, I was just bored with this book because not a lot happens. Judging from the other reviews, I guess this is a book that one will either love or hate. With so many terrific books out there I don't see why anyone should waste their time with this one. Maybe I just don't get the ""chic lit"" genre."
4,Very well-written and entertaining,I'd suggest this book for anyone between 15 and 35. It's a great snapshot of our generation and Ms. Weiner is a capable spokesperson. The characters have depth and the plot is compelling. It is also a very quick read if you are between other books.
2,"""Good In Bed""... enough to put me to sleep!!!","Okay, I will give this book 2 stars as it picked up in the end a little but this character is way to depressed and I (a larger women) cannot relate to this at all. There is just no excuse! Did we forget that she broke it off with the guy and called him weak, pathetic, etc. Even to the end Cannie does not seem to wake up and ""get strong"" she just whines!!!! Jennifer is a great author but this was a slow, depressing read and I did not feel anything when I completed it. Usually you are sad because its over, or smiling with tears, or laughing... the last paragraph was weird and I was just glad it was over so I could start something else! Anyway, I always finish what I start but it is NOT a BEACH read... Try Sheryl Woods or Janet Evanovich or Rachel Gibson, those you will love! Will not pass this one in the box to my friends."
4,"Good book, but a little depressing.","Good in Bed was a great book. I enjoyed reading it, and actually finished it in one sitting. The main character, Cannie, is very likable. Nevertheless I gave the book four stars because it is a very sad book. There are very funny moments, but the book is very moving and sad as it recounts Cannie's troubled year after ""taking a break"" from her boyfriend. I didn't find it to be predictable. I wouldn't consider it a beach read either since it is not as light hearted as expected.It is well written, and very moving."
4,Better than I expected...,"I haven't read a novel that I enjoyed for quite some time. I felt that this was a great book for a ""normal"" person like me. Even though I am not a ""larger"" woman, I still felt that I could relate to the character in other ways that society may not deem me to be ""attractive"". I felt that this book was REAL and that's what I liked most about it...and the fact that the ending was a happy one!"
2,Good book for beach.,"A feel-good ""fat girl's revenge book."" Yes, plus-sized women deserve their day in the sun too, and that's why this should be read by the pool or on the beach. I liked it well enough, but the heroine's suffering garnered little sympathy from me and her success, while enviable, is as believable as Subway's Jared commercials."
5,"A Good, Fun Read - In Bed or Anywhere Else","I was skeptical when I first picked this book up, but was hooked almost immediately. Cannie (the narrator) is funny, intelligent, and, most importantly, very real.Some of the situations may be a little far-fetched, but that's what makes this fun. I laughed and cried, even laughed through my tears, because Cannie was so easy to empathize with. It was almost as if she was an old friend.I was definitely surprized by some twists, but some of the plot is rather transparent. This didn't matter, though, because I was so involved with the book that it wasn't enough to know what would happen, I had to actually see it happen.Bottom line: I stayed up till 4 AM because I couldn't put the book down."
3,it was okay...,"cannie is a talented and outgoing writer who is going through the throes of 'who-am-i-and-why-did-i-just-dump-my-loser-(but-he-loved-me)-boyfriend'. cannie's family life and past reveals itself as the source of her problems but it's too late for her to change them. and it's too late to change herself...or is it?cannies journey seems long and drawn out. there are some calm moments, but the end just felt like a mad rush. i liked cannie as a character but part of me just gave up on her at some point. overall, this is a good plane/train read...although i wouldn't recommend it at the beach, why would you take a dark cloud to a sunny destination?"
3,Good for Bed,"Weiner, without a doubt, is a crafty story-teller. She's able to weave a novel together from a so-so plot. The characters are enjoyable enough, yet not enough to make this a page-turner for me; for I wasn't all that excited about what was going to happen next to heroine Cannie Shapiro and her co-horts. And there lies the problem. The book comes across more as a script for the latest failed network sitcom...a group of characters you don't mind getting together with once a week, for a trial-run. Which is why I saved this book for bed-time; an hour a day with Cannie and her friends over a three week period was more than enough for me. Paging Bridget Jones!"
4,Great Read,I really enjoyed this book so much so that I was disappointed when I finished it. I really felt connected to the characters and felt the emotions between the main character and her eventual love interest. You could feel the intense emotion throughout this novel. I can't wait to read her next book!
4,Hard to put down,"Wonderful story of a very likable Cannie. Although the story seem unbelievable at times, the author brought to light a real life, witty, intelligent person whom you could not help butlike. Her sad and somewhat tragic life did not seem so bad, by the way her witt and attitued towards herself and life in general came across. I could not put this book down, but I must say I was slightly diapointed three quaters through with what happened in the airport. This lighthearted funny novel grew sad at times but it all turn out ok, and the ending was beautiful."
2,Most depressing!,"This is the most depressing book I have read in a long time. Cannie's body image problems were so over blown. The ending was nice, but I didn't feel that Cannie ever really grew up. I couldn't believe her best friend was a lawyer and didn't suggest even once that she sue for any of the horrible things that were pushed on her."
4,Sex in the City meets Stephanie Plum,"This book was a great fast read. I found myself laughing outloud and feeling for the character in so many ways. I definitely want to pass it on because it was fun to read, and sometimes that is just what we are looking for. I enjoyed the plot but I think it was the character (her insecurity, sense of humor, and reactions) that closed the deal for me. I would read sequels of book just to see what she is up to next, although now that she is ""healed"" I don't know how the plot would develop. I hope this author puts out more stories of this type for future enjoyment."
3,just plain disturbing,"I picked this book up from the library because I thought I could relate to Cannie, the heroine of this story. It was ok, but until the airport scene where she suffers placenta abruptio and almost loses her baby, then further suffers from a hysterectomy and a bout of depression. The really disturbing part was why didn't anybody tell Cannie sue her ex (at least accept some sort of child support) and press charges against his new girlfriend for assault. Anybody one pushes a 7-1/2 month pregnant woman should've faced charges."
3,Good start,"This book started off really well. Cannie was witty and interesting. As the book goes on, the wit gives way to whining! Cannie does a lot of complaining and no longer is funny or charming. The rest of the characters are boring. It is an easy read, but a little disappointing."
2,"ok, except for the main character","It's hard to like a book when you dislike the main character so much! Cannie, the main character, comes across as incredibly full of herself in regard to how witty and intelligent she thinks she is, even though she appears to have issues about her intelligence. Overall not a bad read, but the end seemed to rush into a happy ending all of a sudden, and not a believable one."
5,Weiner is a winner,Read ALL of her books. If you loved one you will love them all. They do not necessarily need to be read in any order. I can't wait for her next one. Happy reading!
4,A great beach read!,"OK, so it's winter. A beach book is still a beach book and this is one of the really fun ones. You just want to keep reading this book...."
4,"A light, fun read.","Well-paced story line and light, amusing writing style make this a fun summer read. Any reader who is a ""larger woman"" will definitely laugh at the heroine's tart, witty remarks about body image. (I know I did!) Thoroughly enjoyable."
4,Good In Bed by Jennifer Weiner,"The book was in pretty good condition for being a used book but the only thing that upset me was the fact that the first page after the title page was torn out of it. Thankfully it wasn't detrimental to the story,but I like to have all my pages intact when I buy a book. This is why I'm not sure if I would buy from this person again. That fact wasn't stated in their review of the item."
2,YUCK! Weiner WHINES,Ok - so I read this book with high hopes. It had super early reviews. I liked the fact that the heroine was a plus sized woman with a professional career.Boy was I disappointed.... another whining long story where a woman has to go through hell and end up thin in order to find happiness.This is advertised as a comedy- NO WAY! There is graphic disturbing violence toward the end . The heroine is pushed to the ground while very pregnant and forced into horrific labor which leaves her uterus torn and then removed and her baby in terrible distress. Comedy? If I want angst I will read something that is better written.
1,Boring,"This book is so bland and boring, I couldn't get passed the first few chapters. I don't know what the hype is all about, it's one of the worst books I've read this year!"
5,One of The Best Books I Ever Read,"Good In Bed is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I would rank it right up there with The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. Jennifer Weiner is an excellent author. I think Cannie is the kind of character that most young women in their 20's and 30's could relate to on a number of levels. Whether you have struggled with your weight, have had trouble getting over a guy you love, have unresolved issues with your family, or even if you havent had any of these problems, you could understand Cannie and what she is going through. She is definitely the type of character that you root for and want her to have a happy ending. I could hardly put this book down yet i didnt want it to end. I heard they might be making this book into a show, similar to Sex in the City...if that is true, I cant wait to see it!!!"
5,Amazing!!,"This is hands down one of the best 30-something books I have ever read! It was hysterical! Also, I just love the way the author made me feel as though I was traveling right beside Cannie throughout the entire book. When I started getting close to the end of the book, I started reading only a few pages a day because I didn't want it to end! I would definitely recommend this book. A++++++++"
4,There IS hope 4 the Underdog!,"I absolutely loved this book! I intially purchased it based on some reviews, wasn't sure if I'd enjoy, surprisingly enough I did. There were many times where I related to the characters. Weiner did a great job at making the characters jump out at you (even if you don't really like them, you still understand them & can relate them to people in your life). I totally recommend this book, it's an easy read, and very enjoyable!"
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Despite feeling like I always had to hide the title of this book when out in public because people would think I am reading a 'sex' book, I have to say I really enjoyed the book, the writing style, and the characters. Very well written with a realistic edge and dialog. Congrats to Jennifer Weiner!! I recommend this book to all."
5,I Couldn't Put It Down!,I absolutely loved this book!! I actually came upon it by accident - someone in my office was returning it to someone else and asked me to hold on to it. Of course I just had to take a peek at page one and that was all it took! I really felt like I was involved with the characters - they were all so real! I actually felt bereft when the book ended. Cannie sounds like someone I'd love to have as a friend. I'm looking foward to reading more from Jennifer Weiner.
4,Easy reading,"I'm reading the book while Hurricane Isabel takes over my area of Virginia, and I'm liking it so far. It's a quick read -- and I guess I identify altogether too well with Cannie, as I'm also a plus-sized journalist who can't hold down a relationship and who has literally every weird possible thing happening that can happen. The author hits it on the head with her descriptions of not necessarily feeling unworthy, but of definitely feeling a bit of discomfort with the lead character's physical appearance. This is a definite must-read for the upper-20s set who have body image issues."
3,Beautiful rods & photographs...,"LA Garcia looks to be one of the premier rod builders out there. The photographs are spectacular and are not lacking. The only area lacking in my opinion is in instruction. I still had many questions after reading this book. It is helpful in the craft, but other books and instruction (preferably from an experienced rod builder) will be required for building rods. Tom Kirkman's book is much more thorough."
4,Beautifully done,"The layout and photographs of this book are beautiful. Ritzy flyrod shops should have this one lying around for people to read and admire. In general it is a very good introductory book on building a graphite fly rod and I built one using it. I did find the explanation of how to determine the rod blank's spine to be confusing. However, there are several good explanations of rod spine on the net. It has a good description of how to do a two color thread wrap, that is, a one color main wrap with a different color accent. Mine looks mighty nice, cobalt blue accented with gold on a charcoal blank. (St. Croix SC-III 6wt. 9ft.)"
3,Did not work on m y dog.,"I am sure it is a good product, but my dog has skin problems & get yeast infections so it did not work for my dog,"
3,"Okay shampoo, better than most.","I was looking for a great shampoo that would really help with my dog's itching and dry skin. This is a nice shampoo and cleans her up really good, but doesn't take care of any itching or dry skin beyond a day. Smells nice though and makes her soft."
5,Classic,"IMO this book is a classic and a must read! Doreen Valiente was/is one of the brightest pioneers of ""modern"" Wicca as we know it today."
3,nice practice view,"Doreen is the writer of Gardnerian Book of Shadows, is a poet and was a former HPs of Gardner himself. no wondering, this is the awesome view of an Elder, a book in the same importance of fifty years in wicca (Frederic Lamond), with full informations, history, antropology and practice. very useful and a must to sincere seekers."
4,This book is quite informmative.,"I have read this book. I found it to be an informitive treatise. I engoy the links she drew between Witchcraft, Sufism, and Tantra."
4,Not Bad,This book is interesting and the book cover is well designed. Readers should check outStock Investing Simplifiedas well.
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this book recently together with the author's other book, Getting a Job in New Zealand. Plenty of pages were spent on immigration procedures ( and samples of application forms) which are readily available from the internet and are more up to date. The author has too much British bias and, I suspect, this book was intended only for potential immigrants from UK who also might not find anything useful. Having read a lot of books on the subject,I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Really bad!,"Now this is very bad indeed. There is no real plot. OK, C Theron is a great actress but this movie even manages to look cheaply done. Avoid at all costs"
5,aeon amazing,this is the best movie ever she is my idol and my favorite superhero u guys can have wonderwoman as ur favorite aeon is mine!!!!!!
3,"Once again, great talent in not so great film","OK, so what did I expect anyway. The actors do a good job (which I would expect from this group). The director, etc also did well, given what they had to work with. But there was just so much that didn't make it to the screen that the story seemed oddly in media res at every point. And there just wasn't enough subtext or back story to engage me. Having said that, I did think the basic revelatory piece of info (which I won't give away here) was brilliant and unusual. I also thought the effects were very well done. So, I recommend this film if you like this kind of futuristic, game brought to life, kind of film."
2,Nothing Special.,"I was a fan of the animated series, Aeon Flux. I loved its quirky and bizzare storylines and characters. When I heard about Charlize Theron playing the lead in this film, I knew it wasn't a good sign. When I heard that a director with ONE feature film behind her was attached to this, I knew it wasn't a good sign.I could mention the production designer, costume designer, etc. also, but really it was the script and direction OR the studio that ruined this film.This film was what you could call ""Sci-Fi Lite"" even though the studio tried to market it as an action thriller with a formulaic movie trailer that did absolutely nothing but misrepresent the film.In the end the action scenes are poorly photographed and seem to be edited to hide a profound lack of... action. The story is flat and any resemblance to the original series is painfully absent."
1,BLOWS !,This movie is a complete letdown & waste of time & money ! It's only redeming factor is checking out Charlize Theron.If you're a Fan of Aeon Flux ...the MTV cartoon was supremely better !
3,Everybody has different taste,"I ordered this movie because I had seen it before. I think it's a very weird but good movie. What can I say, everybody has differnt taste as with anything."
1,the film version,"As one esteemed critic so aptly put it, ""Fux fux sux fux sux sux sux"".The animated series that appeared on Liquid Television was cool, especially for it's time. Liquid Television was a good show bringing viewers highly original and entertaining animation. As for the movie, in my opinion they completely blew it. Charlize Theron is talented but wasn't at all right for the part. I thought Carrie-Anne Moss would have been better. The movie wasn't at all like the TV show. The creator of Aeon Flux said upon seeing the movie he ""felt helpless, humiliated and sad"". They should have stayed true to the TV series and Peter Chung should have had creative input."
5,One of Sci Fi Bests,"This movie is an excellent adaptation of the original animated series. What makes this such a great movie is the fact that although it is based in the original anime, it has a more solid plot and storyline. Charlize Theron makes a very believable performance, as well as the rest of the characters, and the plot of the story will have science fiction fans whooping. Excellent movie!"
4,Surprisingly Good Sci-Fi . . .,"I went into this film with extremely low expectations. I used to watch the animated Aeon Flux series which was very well done, if not somewhat confusing. Bringing Aeon Flux to the big screen actually IMPROVES upon the original. The film fleshes out the the story/history of Aeon Flux and actually makes the entire premise understandable. This film was an enjoyable ride with some interesting special effects, some were good, some were lacking (I found all the blood in the film very fake). Overall, this film is a good watch for anyone interested in sci-fi (even if not totally original). The film stands on its own without any viewing of the animated series. Four stars = above average. Aeon Flux gets a well deserved four stars."
4,Pretty good for a film with a cult following,"The way this film was made was thr right way. It was good for those who are cult followers of the animated series and it aldo entertained those that are not familiar with this concept. I love the special efects, please remember that Aeon was before matrix, so if you see any crazy stunts and ""bullet time"" and you are quick to say "" they rip off that from the matrix"" then you my friend are wrong, this movie uses a lot of that very good stunts, high tech, cloning, shooting and a very good conspiracy theory story line. I love it and I am buying it when it comes out I recommend it for fans of a goods sci fi action movie. Charlize impresedme with her performance (perharps she should have been BloodRayne)."
4,Days of future yet to come?,"I must confess that when I first saw the plot for this movie I was reminded of Woody Allen's ""Sleeper""! No, this is not a comedy. But it does have a plot to eliminate the ""Leader"", so that society can be restored to its 'former glory' -- if we can say that as a truth. Far more serious than what Mr. Angst had to say, it is nonetheless a very compelling movie... Draws you in, so to speak. Well the Blu-Ray price was captivating, so I put it on my Wish List, only to discover that I already had it! I finally got around to putting my undocumented DVD's into my computer's library, and then discovered the duplication. One should always make a list before shopping!"
4,I SOUGHT AND I BOUGHT,I had been looking for this video for awhile. I happened tobe in amazon.com and decided to look. NOW I HAVE IT ALONG WITH ULTRAVIOLET.
4,A surprisingly tasty little gem.,"I didn't go into Aeon Flux expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised at how much it delivered. It's a surprisingly literate, thoughtful interpretation. Of course, Charlize looks hot as hell in various ""Fetish Ball"" outfits, and the stunts are occasionally breathtaking.But the real surprise about this movie is just how smart it is. It is only loosely based on the MTV Aeon Flux animated series, but it is true to the shows ""Vibe"", and works as a surprisingly astute commentary on 21st C society. The care and attention that went into the script shines, and puts this far beyond your usual film/comic adaptation.The ""special edition"" DVD contains two commentary tracks, and well over an hour of well-done special features.It's beautiful, it's smart, it's fun, it has sexy mutant women in bondage gear, it has lots of cool toys and explosions...what more could you want?"
4,on Flux,"Ok let me start by prefacing, I have NOT seen the animated series, nor do I really want too. I'm not that much into cartoons anymore, save for the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, etc. Now onto the film. I don't see what peoples problem is, it's a really good movie and Charlze Theron looks hot as always. I'm a sucker for anything that gets her in tight form-fitting leather. I thought it was a good movie that people should rate based on it's own and not base it on the series, people do that too much."
2,"re-gift for your pre teen, now","Although the previews & star suggested the film might be worthy of a mature & intelligent audience, it was an old, boring story with some flashy special effects and nothing very new. Aeon Flux no doubt does come or will come from the gaming world & thus, the attraction for youth, but any adult who thought they had discovered quality Sci Fi because someone fast talked Charlize Theron into the star role will be no less disappointed. Game World brought to life with Charlize Theron, end of not-so-hot-old struggle for power, clone story...big deal-not."
4,Classy.,"I'm not a heavy sci-fi fan, but I like a well-done futuristic film. Aeon Flux has the action, thought-provoking storyline and unique unfolding plot that kept drawing me into the film. Acting is top-notch, storyline is complex and fun to follow, and the action and special effects are superb. An excellent cast, twisting plot and even costumes will interest you until the very end. Well worth the watch."
2,wow,there is nothing good about this movie. we have heard the plot before. the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen. the outfits are wrong and it is filmed so badly that i do not care what happens to the rest of the human race. i think a lot of my problems with the movie was casting. theron was a horrible pick for the role. very dissapointed.
3,Not bad but not a keeper,"I never saw any of the animated series, so I can't compare it to that. But as a straight up sci-fi action romp, it's okay. The movie had some pretty nifty gadgetry and a fairly decent story, which was a nice surprise. Charlize wears the role of the action heroine well.Overall, it's an okay film to rent. If you're a Charlize Theron fan but not a sci-fi fan, skip this one. If you like sci-fi, I'd reccomend renting before buying. IMHO, it's not a movie that would bear repeated viewing."
3,Good sci-fi flick starring hot babes,"It seems that every hot actress needs to star in at least one comic-book or sci-fi action flick to show of her athleticism, long legs, perfect tone and great figure. Angelina Jolie had Tomb Raider, Halle Berry had Catwoman, Pamela Andersen had Barb Wire, and now Charlize Theron has Aeon Flux. Fortunately, this one is actually very good. Set in the distant future on an Earth decimated by a plague, Ms. Theron plays the title character, an assassin of incredible skill, beauty and ruthlessness. The movie is about her latest mission, and how her discoveries on this mission change her and mankind. This movie is based of a comic-book, which I have not read, so I have no comment on how faithful this film is to the original story. However, I can say the movie is quite good, with great special effects, a plot that was original compared to other action flicks, and Ms. Theron was aptly displayed. Overall, a very entertaining movie."
5,"Very good, true to the toon.","If you watched Aeon Flux on MTV, and liked it, you'll not be disappointed.This movie stays true to the story of the original toon, and I was surprised it was as good as it was.Most TV reviews knocked it, but I thought it had a good storyline.A+_"
4,Just watch,"It may well be that I'm simply not ""sensitive enough"" to catch the nuance or ""finer points"" of such movies. Maybe I'm not centered in the vortex correctly, or haven't found my power ring yet. But then, when I watch movies such as these, I'm not looking for earth moving revealations. I'm not looking for redemption or a higher meaning. I watch for sheer, mind disconnected ENTERTAINMENT. At that, this movie excels.Story and acting aside, this movie is enjoyable SIMPLY to see Charlize MOVE. The costuming was selected to show her shape and she simply moves with grace, wire or not.Sometimes, there is value is simply watching pleasant shape and movement.This is one of those movies."
2,Terrible,This was a terrible movie. I used to watch the cartoon and it was really good. This movies is for men to watch skinny ladies in skin tight clothes.
1,Not even Charlize Theron can save this film,"Not even Charlize Theron can save this film to be a total flop.Extremely dull and unispired. Even a sci-fi fan like me could not reach the end without yawning 1000 times.If you want an exciting sci-fi movie, then look elsewhere. Maybe Matrix or Star Wars will do.Avoid this one like the plague!!"
1,celebrity/fame,"makes ''normal'' people think more of actors/singers than they are worthy of.theron has a pretty face. BIG WHOOP!!!!!! take a pen and paper with you while walking down any street and make a check mark when you pass by a woman as pretty and youll need more paper.theron has NO CURVES! same with j-lo on talent.90% of famous people are given hotty props only because they are famous.then you have the other side of the spectrum like halle barry.she truly is beautiful but she shouldnt be acting.anyway,this movie does indeed flux the big one.she dodges bullets and soldiers with boring karate kicks and flips while never getting her hair messed up.brilliant!hollywood fails YET AGAIN to take a tv show and turn it into something its not,a movie!in closing,lonely males should find this 5 star material."
1,A joke?,"One word: HORRIBLE.This is probably the worst attempt to make some fancy sci-fi movie I have ever seen - simply everything is bad.It's so bad, laughably pathetic, so cheesy that even the otherwise very talented CT becomes pathetic too."
1,"Silly movie, HD version no better than regular version","I didn't like the movie itself but was intrigued by Charlize (hehehe...) when I saw a bit of this film at my friend's house, on regular DVD. So I rented the Blu-ray version from Netflix as soon as I got my Playstation 3. I was totally unimpressed by the digital quality of the transfer. (I still didn't like the film -- nothing original in this at all and the acting sucks big time.) I couldn't tell it was in hi-def, and the audio part is lame, too."
3,Meh,"I am a huge fan of the original toons from the good ol days of MTV. This movie has some decent eye candy, but misses the target when it comes to the feel of the pulp."
2,Not worth your time nor money.,"The movie has a very inconsistent story, it seems that they didn't consult with any futurists to create something remotely credible. The special effects are very unimpressive, it doesn't show anything worth mentioning."
2,Simplistic and disappointing,"I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of Charlize Theron's work. However, I can't imagine why she took this role. Charlize's light is hidden under the bushel of a director who evidently thinks a story can be told without requiring any emotion from the characters. Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes. The fight sequences are heavily edited, just so much smoke and shadow -- no real martial arts expertise. Skip Aeon Flux and give Ultraviolet a try. That is a much more creative film."
4,Flux in the Flesh,"Trevor is a lot hotter in real life. Theron makes a much prettier Aeon too.The craziness of shifting moralities of the cartoon (oops--animation)characters is gone, sacrificed to the need for Hollywood-type plot and resolution; but, even so, there's a lot to like.The conversion of her character into the consistently honorable hero is smoothly done. The reward of the movieformat is a surprise twist.There is a point at which guys who are not into chick flicks will want to leave the room. Give it another couple minutesand you will be rewarded with a solid action ending."
2,real dull and boring movie.,"The movie has only one thing going for it. The costumes and the cinematography. Other than that, the movie is very lame. All the good scenes were shown in the movie trailer/teaser. So u're not missing anything. Most of the action/stunt scenes happened in microseconds so u couldn't even enjoy the action scenes (not to say they were good to begin with) cuz they all happened so fast. Stupid gymnastic and martial arts crap. Aeon Flux is an ordinarly human being but she has all these superpowers like flying around, martial arts, and shootings guns. I don't get it. This movie is stupid just like Charlie's Angels and Stealth. And razor blade grass and needle shooting fruit trees. Oh And Charlize gives corny one-liners just like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider."
2,"Big budget, big effects, big disappointment","The movie is visually stunning, make no mistake. And there are lots of nice effects. The background story is solid; it is the execution that is flawed.Quite often, the plot feels like information was left out. It never does a good job of transitioning from one moment to the other. In fact, at times it is outright confusing.The flow of the story uses recycled elements. There is the bad guy who really isn't the bad guy, the ""I am your father"" type twist (in this case ""I am your wife""), the hero (or heroine) is hunted by the good guys and the bad guys twist, and the real bad guy is trying to gain power twist. It feels like the director and writers saw several movies and said ""Hey! Lets put that idea in our movie.""The base story was solid, but it was ruined by bad writing and bad directing. I just wish a competent director would take this concept and run with it."
1,"This is a really, really, BAAAAAD movie....","Stay away, run, as far away as you can from this stinker of a movie. Nonsensical plot, horrible acting, cheesy special effects.... Charlize Theron for all her beauty doesn't move with the natural buff athleticism of someone like Kate Beckinsale or Milla Jovovich; she looks wooden and unconvincing as a super-heroine..."
2,Zardoz Redux?,"Um... is it just me or did this storyline borrow HEAVILY from John Boorman's 1975 Zardoz starring Sean Connery in one of his early post-Bond movies? Similarities:* Isolated outpost created by scientists that is protected from ""nature""* People who live forever who are having mental issues (recycled clones in Flux)* Sterility issues in the population* A scientist manipulating the actions of an individual with a talent for extreme violence in an effort to take down the status quo (the old guy in the blimp thingy. In Zardoz it was a scientist in a flying stone idol (that looks remarkably like Janus) trying to find just the right guy (Connery - ""Seth"" if I recall correctly) among a bunch of savages to do the deed.I mean, it isn't an out and out rip off, but the story certainly seems to borrow heavily from Zardoz - also a very weird film that seems to lack cohesion."
4,Love those strong women roles.,This may have not been a blockbuster but I really liked it. Theron does a great job with the female superhero type of role and it was a good sci-fi story with plenty of action.
3,Nothing like the original,"MTV's Aeon Flux (Aeon Flux - The Complete Animated Collection) was interesting and appealing when it first aired. The portrayal and drawing of the characters were not only appealing but intriguing as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the animated Aeon FLux and I was very excited when I heard this movie was coming out. What a dissapointed. Although the stylistic approach may be there and the storyline is interesting someting just falls flat. The action sequences are good and Theron did a good job. But, none of the elements came together as they should have. Something was defiantely missing, such as a better and a little more ruthless Goodchild and a little colder Flux. There was also something missing from this dystopian future world. It was not that good of a movie. On the other hand, the animated Aeon Flux DVDs (Aeon Flux - The Complete Animated Collection) are excellent."
3,"Disappointing, but not without merit.","As a fan of the series, I went into this movie rather cautiously. After loving the weirdness and edginess of the animated version, would the film sit quite right?Well . . . not entirely. Some of the fundamental things about the TV series were lost, sadly. Such as the general sense of weirdness. It was nice to have a few recognizable things, such as Sathara, but Trevor was Trevor in name only, the entire relationship between him and Aeon, which the series hinged on, was changed utterly.Having said that, from a purely entertainment point of view, it wasn't bad. A summer popcorn flick, and a fair sci-fi story. Somewhat predictable action, and very nice sets indeed. If that's what you're looking for, it's not bad. If you're looking for something edgy and different, try the series."
4,Flux your way in Her Beautiful and Captivating World!,"Unbelievable!!! For those that hasn't experience HD (high def), this movie is an eye opener to what HD can do! When Frances McDormand was talking to Charlize Theron (white robe scene), the color was so beautiful, it just stood out very much. Now, I'm not saying this is the best movie with story wise, but as for picture, this is a great piece of DEMO to show what HD is like! This is an awesome movie! Charlize is very cool! If you are into this HD format era, this is a movie to get, in fact i would even go as far as saying is as close a King Kong in HD. This movie is a must have, you won't be upset with the purchase with story and picture wise! Mesmerizing!!"
2,Aeon Flux.......,"Charlize Theron is a great actress without a doubt. So when I see her running around in skin tights, looking fine as ever, I can't help but wonder what jack rod put her up to ruining her acting skills in this horrible adaptation of MTV's long ago animated series, ""Aeon Flux?"" Since I've been writing reviews here on Amazon.com, I've never once written a negative review regarding any musician, actress or actor. Again, no disrepect to Charlize, she's top notch. The writer(s), director(s), whomever..........you know what? I just thought of something. Maybe Aeon Flux, the animated series was never meant to cross over into a movie? That's a possibility. I'm no director, but I'd say, first and foremost, cast the right people for the right roles."
2,"Great picture and sound,Not a good movie","I bought this hddvd just because of the great picture and sound on hddvd.The movie is just ok ,the story is not good at all.If this movie had a better story it might have gotten 4 stars.If you dont care so much for sound and picture stay away from this movie.Even if the price is low,this movie is not worth more than 5 dollars."
3,hhhhhmmm,"havent seen this yet but heres why....so far the reason most are giving this props is because of theron in a catsuit.BIG FREAKIN DEAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wake up call to the hormonially challenged,she only has a pretty face.no boobs or butt as far as the eye can see.some famous people get props for being beautiful/handsome only because they are famous(julia roberts looks like a guy in drag,denzel washington looks like any number of dudes working at a token booth,j-lo is so overrated its sad,ect...PURE HYPE !!!!!).the animated series was awesome.short and sweet.so i will give in and see how bad/good it is.stay tuned"
1,More of a waste than the original,"I remember watching the shorts of this on Liquid Television years ago.. and watching the half hour animated show as well. The shorts made little sense. The half hour show even less. From there to this abomination of a movie it was basically a really flashy, sexy, somewhat interesting concept that was simply never fleshed out into something actually interesting. When the whole thing was teetering, about to topple from its own weight it was buttressed and supported with a bunch of post-apocalyptic scifi movie cliches.. and then the creators called it a day. Thus was this movie born, and thus did it die. A name without a personality... a concept without a purpose.What a waste that this couldn't have been handled by people who weren't complete hacks so that something interesting at least to those who like dystopian sci-fi would be made."
3,Sad to say,"I don't write reviews. In fact, this is my first. What do I know? Well, I know this is an above average story; above average set of actors; and a bad movie. I think I am willing to suspend my demand for reality and go with science fiction, but the problem with this movie is that it often skips over the 'how did he get there' or 'how did he/she know that' way too often. DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED TO THE STORY. The part about clones having a memory is unique and pretty good. Plagued by dreams and intuitive feelings of the past, those who have gone through multiple clonings could well become a bit 'off' mentally. But why should the first clone be in that same category? How would a dead body have knowledge of the doctor that did the cloning? Too much missing information and a storyline that doesn't flow well and sometimes doesn't make sense, even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief. But, it had potential. Worth the rent; but don't buy it."
2,Forget live action go with animation,"I was very disappointed with this film. After seeing this show on Liquid Television on MTV in its animated form, I was initially very excited about this film. The plot was just plain terrible. The actress playing AEon was the character in The Devil's Advocate who cut her neck open, to which she should have done in this film. At least that would have been entertaining."
1,"Call it something else, this ain't Aeon Flux","I loved the Aeon Flux animation in HS. I would watch them over and over (mostly because MTV would reply stuff constantly) and it never got boring, there was always some new detail to take note of.This movie might be a good movie on its own. But it is not representative of Aeon Flux's world at all. It draws only the tiniest bit upon this amazing and endlessly creative world that was the original animation. I was very disappointed by this movie. It was flat and horrible if you're familiar with the animation series."
1,terrible movie,The writing was terrible and the video was just ok. If I had known it was this bad I would have just rented it.
5,best movie ever!!!,"I think that this movie is like the best movie that was ever created!!! Charlize Theron makes such a great performance and she can really releate to the character. The movie has a good plot but at times things can be confusing, otherwise I loved this movie. You should buy this movie!!"
4,Aeon Flux,Charlize Theron is awesome! She is like a fenale Brad Pit who can perform totally different personality.
1,What Were You Expecting???,"MTV churns out brainless crap 24 hours a day, they inflicted Tom Green, Andy Dick and Jessica Simpson upon us.Was anybody really thinking that they were saving their best work for the big screen??This is as good as it gets folks."
1,Fan of the original series? Don't bother.,"At the heart of the animated series' genius was the tension between Trevor and Aeon, sworn enemies that can't stand to get enough of each other.This was almost completely ignored in favor of a moldy old mystery plot and a vacant love story.Instead of any tension (or anything that even remotely matches the cleverness of any one of the old episodes), you have the product of a couple of screenwriters who ""wanted to give a Hollywood feel to the story"" (to paraphrase them, actually) and a director who doesn't seem to know how keep an action movie exciting.Any incarnation of Aeon Fluz should be character-driven. Aside from maybe selling tickets with Charlize Theron's star-power, I'm not sure what the hell was driving this one."
2,Aeon Flux-Disappointing!,"I'm a pretty big fan of Charlize!However,this movie is really slow,difficult to stay with it,in other words,boring.The first 2 times I tried to watch the movie I fell asleep,both times!!Really,it's the gods truth!!Charlize was fantastic,sexy amd smart.She also does at least 90% of the stunts,many of those in this flick.I'm sorry to say though that I can't recommend this movie but the 2nd disk is very informative and again,in some areas,boring.This movie gets only 2 stars!"
2,2nd star for FX only,"I suppose my expectations were too high after having seen the cartoon long ago and holding it in fond memory.Dialogue is insufferably hackneyed in this film.The characters betray their initial and original anti-hero nature long before the major plot cop-outs that render morally questionable characters into cardboard heroes.Get the cartoon anthology instead; this movie is not worth buying and only worth renting as part of a double-bill or multi-title sitting.Even great special effects left me yawning at insipid characters played by actors too important in the Hollywood food chain to be allowed unsympathetic roles or dialogue with words & memes they're too dim to express with conviction of understanding.And, as all too usual in Hollywood, when the pace falters, it's time to show off automatic weapons. I never knew machine guns could be so boring."
2,Visually impressive and incredibly trite,"The live action adaptation of Peter Chung's beloved anime series Aeon Flux is one of the most visually impressive sci-fi films to be released in the last year, and it's also one of the most incredibly trite and tedious as well. Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think. The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good. The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy."
1,Terrible!,"Basically this movie promotes a heroine who practices genocide against her own people by deliberatly severing the only lifeline that her entire species has to survival. Shortly after this, amongst heaps of praise for her unexcusable decision, the movie ends as though all is now well. The main villain has been a psycho running around murdering pregnant women. The main charecter is suposedly this great, pure person, but she takes his crimes soooo much further by eliminating her species.All in all, a terrible movie! The designers seemed to have been promoting her sickening actions too which is perhaps the worst of it, that they condone the murder-suicide of the entire human species."
1,What did I just watch?,"I dont mind getting thrown into a fast paced action movie. But when the main character can perform moves in a Kill Bill fashion without the intentional camp factor then it get boring really fast. The plot was a flop for me though I didnt know about a series before I watched the movie. Apparently she gets driven into moral action outside of her duty when she begins remembering things from a past life she had some 400 years ago, goes against the orders of some all knowing rebel leader, begins figuring out things that no human logic could jump to, and manages to fit a sex scene in all at the same time. I will say though, the cg was pretty good, but other than that there is no reason to see this movie."
4,Liquid TV Revisited,This move gets my vote as I'm some one of the Liquid TV era Ienjoyed see the animated Aeon take a real person roll.The movie leaves room for sequals as was the Idea with origonal animated version.Hopefully there will be more to come.She's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation.The Science Fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence.It would be nice if MTV was still as entertaining as Aeon.
3,Just Okay,"SciFi in the future.More acrobatics than acting.Script okay. Charlize Theron not great, just okay.The entire DVD is just okay."
2,"fabulous effects, mediocre story, not watchable more than once","As a fan of hard sci-fi, I am at a loss as to why so many current productions have great computer effects but the same banal plots (revolutionary against dystopia with special abilites to inflict violence, etc.). I read reviews, buy them, and then feel so disappointed that I never want to view them again. For the most part, while occasionally intrigued, I feel, ""that's it? They did this whole thing and THAT was all they had to offer?"" Unfortunately, this is one of those films: the images are striking, the mystery fun, and then you get to the end and wonder how any producer could have imagined it would sell enough to recoup the investment.Not recommended. I won't play the spoiler, but really, you are better off reading the comic book."
4,Aeon Flux (Special Collector's Edition),"This film is great for the futuristically Sifi inclined watcher however if you have seen the hype of the film you may be let down by this movie. I would say Give this film a day in court and see what you think of this film, Its one of those that each individual will really like or will really not like. One thing I can promise is that the speciall effects are Phenominal."
4,I liked it.,"Aeon Flux is a good watch for anyone who enjoys lots of action(and the fact that a woman is doing the butt kicking makes it an even better watch). I personally like the storyline about how a virus attacks 99% of earth's population and how they are trying to correct the damaging effects of the cure. I was mesmerized by the screen the whole time it was running. Kept my attention, kicked butt, and left me overall more than satisfied."
3,So so Movie... great eye candy.,"This is visually one of the best movies I've ever seen. The director, Karyn Kusama, whom I never heard of before, did a great job of visual composition. The photography is also exquisite. Too bad the story and the plot are kind of weak. Charlize Theron does a very credible job as an action hero, but lets face it, this movie is all about looking great in tights and not about great acting. She definetely got the ""looking great"" aspect right. Of the HD DVD's I've watched so far, only King Kong matches it for color depth and detail. The Berlin and Potsdam locations shine thru. Those lucky enough to have visited this amazing city know how many more achitectural marvels await to be exploited in film. If you enjoy eye candy and can appreciate the beauty of architecture, then this film is for you."
4,Video Quality Review (Blu-ray),"Detail is great. You could easily, given a great deal of free time, count the stubble on Marton Csokas' five o'clock shadow. Scenery is attractive and well shot. Colors are rich. Still something about this transfer holds it back from five stars. Perhaps it is the slight but discernable busyness of the grain during sharp scenes or the slightly out-of-focus feel during the grain free scenes. I didn't see this film at the theatre so maybe the transfer isn't at fault. And these faults aren't at all distracting, I barely noticed them as I watched the film, but when compared to best Blu-ray discs Aeon Flux is a small step down. Still recommended, still impressive, still an upgrade over standard DVDs; but not the best looking 1080p material out there.(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92"")"
4,excellent resourse.,"Covers the what, were, and how to of Beeswax. Has some simple recipes and covers how to use beeswax safety."
4,Worth the price of admission,If your new to the world of Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) Everquest was one of the very first. The Titanium edition represents litterally years of game content for you to explore! What is more (and the reason I got back into it) is the fact it can be easily played on dialup. For those of you whom do not have access to a broad band connection or travel a lot where broad band is often not avalable (I travel a good deal these days and this game gives me something to do on the road). For one small price you get access to a world rich in lore and content with nice graphics that will not bog your system down. (especially if you play on a laptop like I do.)
3,"Fun game, discs were questionable",The game is great but the quality of the discs leaves much to be desired. During installation I had to re-insert one of the discs 7+ times to finally get it to read. Other than that I was satisfied with the purchase.
2,Two Hands,"Great engineering and good feel, but WM5 is not competitive if your first desire is a phone with some e-mail and calendar. It takes 2 hands to do much of anything well."
5,Keep it original...,"I paid almost $500 for my laser printerso I am willing to pay for a original brothertoner cartridge. What would you think if thegeneric toner cartridge dumped its contentsall over the floor or the interior of yourlaser printer, would you still think it was a bargain?I also believe that brother cartridges are way overpricedthere is only 4 1/2 ounces of toner in the cartridge"
3,Lemmon,"If you like the films of Jack Lemmon, then this is realy a bargain. In my opinion not all of the films can be titled ""Best of Lemmon"". But considering the price of the box, you really have a bargain."
5,Jack Lemmon is always a delight!,"Jack Lemmon is a comedy legend, well worth all the praise he received and still receives to this day! I loved this collection of films, especially the controversial ""Under the Yum Yum Tree"". Of course, I've got a soft spot for Dean Jones. In any case, I'd watch anything with Jack Lemmon, and I highly recommend this collection to all Lemmon fans!"
4,NEW PROBLEM,"OK GUYS, I have never had this problem before. I have over $12,000 in DVD's and this is a first. THE DVD'S ARE LABELED WRONG (ie the DVD labeled ""THE YUM YUM TREE"" is actually ""THE NOTORIOUS LANDLADY"". I have not gone through them all yet, but at least 4 of the 5 are effected. Out of respect for Mr. Lemmon, I did not want to give the set less than 4 stars, (this is NOT his fault) but cmon SONY, whats the deal. This was NOT a cheap set!!!!"
3,GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM...CLASSIC JACK LEMMON!! HILARIOUS! FOUR STARS!,"MR. JACK LEMMON: The man is a CLASSIC!Best two flics here, in my opinion are GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM -and UNDER THE YUM-YUM TREE. My question is, why are we forced to buy a whole set of movies if we just prefer certain ones? This seems to be abit unfair. It would be nice to be able to order the two flics Imentioned above. Come on, COLUMBIA, dont force us to buy films we dont want. Please be so kind and release some of these flics Seperately!!( GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM is the best flic here. HILARIOUS! CLASSIC LEMMON!)"
5,Jack Lemmon Film Collection,"Being a Jack Lemmon fan, I was pleased to add this collection to my video library. It was well priced and has a great collection of Jack Lemmon films."
1,Failed Alchemy,"This author seems to be on a downward trend. I have read all the books in this series. The first ones were enjoyable. The last one before this was disappointing. This is a dud. The story does not hang together. The plot is inadequate, parts of it are far fetched, and the ending does not work. She neglects the personal relationships which were interesting in the earlier books."
2,disappointing,I loved her first Dr. Strange books but have been disappointed in the last two. I thought the storyline was unrealistic and confusing. The end felt forced and and tied up to easily.Sylvia's relationship issues were just brushed away. I felt this wasn't much of a mystery nor did it have any psychological insight or suspense.
3,"""Almost"" to Group Action",The book does a good job describing the process of using the Workshop Method with groups and even an individual use. It also explains how to set it up. The thing missing was how to take the information the group discovers from the workshop method and move into some sort of action. I wish the book had an additional chapter that helped with that. I would have given the book a four star rating except the title implies that it deals with the action step and I felt it was missing. But if someone is wanting a book that explains how to prepare for and do the workshop method this book is very good.
5,Carrie is and strong once she knows her own strenth!,"THis was my second favorite book in the Hearts and Dreams series. I loved the character Carrie ! She was strong once she knew her own strenth and she could do anything! I hope that Ms. Cameron will write a new book for this wonderful series!I love reading historical romanaces and hope she will start a new series after she has completed the ""Hearts and Dreams"" !"
5,Great Bio,This biography read like a novel. I couldn't put it down. My father grew up near Selma where Wilson defeated Forrest and burned the foundry. This gave the book a personal touch. I highly recommend it if you would like to learn a little more about the man.
3,Mapping Out a Familiar Route,"Edgar Froese issues a compilation of a series of compilations that were inspired by a 2-CD set of past solo material and remixes.This 13-number set is a sampler from the four volumes of Ambient Highway, which is an expanded form - through additional tracks - of a 1995 release, Beyond the Storm. Essentially, it is an excellent way to travel this route without exploring the entire series and the double-set that got things rolling.The Introduction is the map to use, since the ambient highway may continue to be ""under construction"" through re-releases and studio tweaks."
4,Excellent outdoor speakers,"These speakers provide a remarkably full sound and good dynamic range. I have these mounted on a pergola above my deck about 10' high; I would suggest not mounting them quite so high so as to get a more immediate sound; however, even at this height the omnidirectional speaker provides good coverage (I have it down-firing) and an enveloping sound field. Bass response is probably as good as you can expect in an outdoor speaker, and was better than I had hoped for. I have not rated this as 5-star only because these speakers seem to be a little overpriced. Although, f you're looking for some of the best outdoor speakers, I don't think you'll do better at any price point."
5,One of the top obscure vocabulary books of the 20th century,"Rather than being a cute book about words (c.f. Richard Lederer), this book is as elitist and erudite as its title suggests. It reaches beyond its analogues with exercises, for example: given English synonyms in Latin and Greek, what is the English synonym with an Anglo-Saxon root? If you're interested in the English language, grab this book if you can find it. (It defines zeugma, after all - how can you live without a book that does that?)"
1,bad writing..... boring read..,"Reader beware! If you know the difference between stick figure characters and real people, your intelligence may be insulted by reading this book. Although the story has a great premise...the dialoge between the chiefs of staff, (including the President) is embarrassing and unrealistic. Oliver North may be a hero, a likable one at that, but as a writer of espionage and covert adventure....""Where have you gone Nelson Demille ...A nation turns it's lonely eyes to you. Woo. Woo. Woo."""
1,NWO thugs write books too?,Oliver North and friends helped arm the fundamentalist mullahs of IRAN back in the 80s. The fact that North is not locked up is a testament to the high level of corruption the U.S. government is bathed in. This guy should turn in his uniform. He was interviewed on Alex Jones awhile back and dodged questions on the scandal. He just wanted to promote his ghost written garbage books.
5,Excellent,Page turning suspense. The way the Christian life is mixed into the story is authentic. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,The Assassins,This book was purchased for my son who is 17. He really enjoyed it and my husband will be reading it next. They both also really liked the two preceding books.
3,Interesting....but The Acronyms!!!!,"I'm not yet done with this novel. I find it authentic and interesting; even a bit spooky, because it could foretell something of the future, i.e., another plot by Islamic terrorists against the U.S. But I find myself plodding through it every time I pick it up. Why? Look at the front of the book; there is a list of dozens of acronyms (i.e., CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, etc.). I find myself often losing some of the storyline because I would get so tired of turning to the front of the book to figure out what they meant, I would give up and just pass them by, clueless as to their meaning. And, believe me, they're everywhere! I think I would like it much more if it weren't for this one annoying feature."
3,Russian names are all wrong,"I picked up this book at the airport - I had not read the others in this set. I thought it was a pretty good story, but not as good as Vince Flynn or Tom Clancy. And Tom Clancy would have never consistently written the Russian names wrong (and in all 3 books I assume). This bothered me throughout the entire book.Russians never address each other by first and last name. It's either Rank and Last name, first name and patronimic (based on the father's first name), or a shortened ""familiar"" form of the first name."
4,Tom Clancy lovers will Love These books,"""Assassins"" is part 3 of the Oliver North technothriller series. This series is probably the best of this type marketed by a Christian publisher, though the `Christian' parts of the book are subtle, not as contrived as in other books. Sometimes it still seems as they are peppered in there for the sake of certain readers. And one wonders where the editor learned his or her trade, once you notice the """" around word after word it becomes annoying. English class anyone? But the great strength of this series is the realism and the ""ripped from the headlines,"" even more so than some Clancy novels."
2,Pretty Shallow Stuff,"I just finished reading this book about a half hour ago. I guess you could compare it to a Tom Clancy book, because like many of Clancy's novels there are soldiers and politicians and terrorists. However Clancy understands things like plot and pace and letting the characters develop in the readers mind instead of spelling everything out for them in the first 50 pages.The characters are so one dimensional and cliched, it's hard to take them seriously and I'm sorry to say Colonel North's military experience isn't enough to make the story anywhere near believable.I was also disappointed at how forced the interjection of Christianity was in this story. It seemed to me like these stories are written and then North and/or Musser make them just religious enough to sell at Christian bookstores.I guess I like my thrillers a little more...dare I say nuanced?"
5,Another great one from Colonel North,"I really enjoyed the Jericho Sanction, thus I didn't think a sequel would be even better. Well, Oliver North proved me wrong. It is a great novel saturated with thrilling action, wealth of interesting information about various military and government agencies and organizations working to keep us safe, and unbelievable patriotism. If you liked the Jericho Sanction, you will love this book.As a side note, this book, like Oliver North's other books, would undoubtedly make a great action movie -- but don't hold your breath. Somehow, I don't think that a God-fearing, patriotic hero U.S. Marine risking his life for our freedoms is a modern day hero of the anti-American establishment in Hollywood."
4,Highly Entertaining,"This book of three short stories was very entertaining. It was perfect to read one story after I got home from work before I went to bed. Each started out with a baby being left someplace in a basket for people to find (or in the case of the 2nd story to not find). Things just took off from there, all with happy endings. If you want a simple mindless read, this book is for you....Happy reading"
5,Most Excellent!,"I give this book as a present to all my instrument students upon ""graduation"". It's my favaorite on the subject. It'll teach you all the things you fell asleep on while reading FAA'sInstrument Flying Handbook: FAA-H-8083-15A (FAA Handbooks series)(which is an excellent book also, just dry and full of ""just the facts"").I generally don't recommend it to the student in training simply because it is best read with some experience under the belt, so to speak. This book helped me develop my own ""personal style"" of flying IFR and helped me to become a more professional and savvy pilot. 7,000 hours later I still find it interesting and valuable reading."
2,GOOD FOR EXPERIENCED,"Title should be ""tips for experienced instrument flyers"". The author presumes the reader has an intimate knowledge of advanced avionics and imparts only arcane minutiae. It is a perhaps a good read after one is instrument certified, most particularly because it lacks the graphic presentation to which a cursory narrative of visually based instruments is insufficient."
4,Great book for an IFR student,I've been using this book to read up on different facets of IFR flying just prior to each of my IFR classes. It has worked extremely well to prepare me for what the excercises I am about to do under the hood. A little short on information in some areas but overall a great book. Well worth the money.
5,"When you lose Hope, you lose life.","This story is about a Vet who has a bad injury that refuses to heal. One day he just ups and leaves the hospital, he figures that the hospital isn't helping so he decides to enter the world to see what kind of adventure he would run into before he dies. What he finds is Hope, a will to live, friends that need him and a job. When you lose Hope, you lose the will to live. When you find Hope, you find the will to live."
4,"Preachy, but worth reading","I've just finished this book after reading A Girl of the Limberlost. There are some surprising elements of the book, like the part about the healing properties of tomato and orange juice and the other things the Bee Keeper does to help himself. It is a good, wholesome book. It was very preachy at times and that got annoying. The little Scout was hilarious and a very original character. Some of the story was unbelievable-he decides to marry the girl for real after just meeting her face to face once? I do agree that the descriptions of the scenery are very well done and that it is possible feel like you are right at the seashore too."
5,Stays in the memory bank.,"I first read a beat up dusty old copy of ""The Keeper Of The Bees"" when I was 10 years old,in 1958. To say it impressed me is an understatement. The story stayed in my memory for years, a very comforting memory. Around 2003 I purchased a copy from Amazon and, 45 years after first reading it, I was just as delighted the 2nd time around. My wife says it is old fashioned, but that didn't worry me none. I reckon it is still a beautiful tale. Perhaps I'm old fashioned too."
5,"When it comes to stories, I consider this volume to be one of the best of the best.","One of the highest compliments that can be paid to any book is the desire of a reader to share it with everyone who loves a well-written, engaging, surprising account of someone's life. Gene Stratton-Porter mixes nature with narrative, children with adults, losses with gains and adds a richness of character that cannot be denied."
5,The Keeper of the Bees,"As a teenager, I balked at my mother's suggestion of reading the old book which was falling apart at the seams. Much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed ""The Keeper of the Bees"" and I'm looking forward to reading other books by Gene Stratton-Porter. This story is of an injured soldier who runs away from the best hospitals the military could offer and escapes to the beach to die. Much to his surprise, rather than relying on others constantly, he finds himself helping others throughout his journey. This experience helps improve his health both mentally and physically. This is an excellent book for readers of all ages and a must for the home library collection."
3,Yawn,"I read this book only because the reviews were so promising. The imagery was good, the story could've been good and probably was when it was written. If, like me, you want to give it a go because of the reviews but find yourself bored and rolling your eyes with the 'homey wisdom' stop reading immediately--it will not get better."
1,Corelle Livingware,My wife and I ordered 2 sets of the corelle ware. We even got a $10 discount automatically. The order came quicker than expected and everything was in excellent shape. We like this type of diningware better than china ware. It is virtually indestructible. I lkie Amazon's free shipping. I've purchased many things through Amazon and haven't been disappointed.
3,"Interesting, entertaining","Kids were awesome dancers, moms were real and really unbelievable. Abby was quite a character. Show gives insight into parenting - good and bad."
5,Best show ever!,"Best show ever! So addicting, fun show to watch. I hope this show never ends. Mrs. Abby is the ultamite dance teacher and anyone who wants to become a professional dancer should be trained by her, she is amazing."
5,Dance Moms Season 1 DVD,This has made my dancer very happy. She can watch anytime she wants! She can never get enough of Abby Lee
3,Watching competitive moms,This show is interesting to watch because I have a hard time believing people can behave so badly. It is amazing what some moms think is ok.
3,It's like watching a train wreck over and over again,"I love reality tv and this is great reality tv because the people are so over the top. There were times where my husband looked at me and said this cannot be real, people are not really this way right? And then later he said wow I think they are real. You just can't make this stuff up! It seriously feels like watching a demolition derby train wreck spectacular.Intermixed is some pretty dancing too. The things the girls can do with their bodies is pretty phenomenal too."
2,Poor little girls,"These little girls would be better off in a regular dance class, such as ballet. Winning contests isn't what dancing is about."
3,Called Dance Moms for a reason,I really enjoy watching the girls dance but the show is called Dance Moms for a reason. There is a lot of drama and swearing with a fair bit of bad behavior from the moms mixed in. You have to have a stomach for nonsense to watch this show.
3,Love Chloe!,"Abby is a terrible dance teacher, she does clearly display favorites, but I think all the girls are amazing dancers!!"
4,Amazing,"The package came in almost perfect condition,there was a little tear in the plastic wrap,but nontheless the dvd works and its amazing"
4,"It didn't have the whole episodes, just parts of it of the awards mostly.","As I was watching the seasons I notice it wasn't the whole 3episode and only showed bits and pieces except the awards. I thought I would be getting the whole hour show that came on TV all the time. I was dissappointed but it's not the sellers fault.Great Seller and S&H; was great, thank you so much."
4,i like this show.,"This show gets my blood boiling! I get so mad at those ""grown-ups"". I think that is the whole point of the show."
3,okay,"Promotes the concept of a variety of flavors of women who are each personally disempowered at some vital, core level - and who have either too much time or money on their hands, so they can play it out fully under the guise of ""helping"" their daughters."
1,HUMAN MONSTERS OF THE WORST KIND!!!,"Abey Lee Miller should be in JAIL for multiple counts of assault on a minor, pedophilia, child endangerment etc,etc! Each and everyone of these children should be taken from their homes and placed in protective custody and every mother should be charged with child abuse!!"
1,and you criticize toddlers and tiaras,this show is 100X worse than toddlers and tiaras ........way way WAY WORSE ......GOD AND SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZE TODDLERS AND TIARASLook at this show.....way way worse
4,Almost Terrific,"The only reason I don't give this book an unqualified ""Terrific"" is that not all of the tactics are truly free. The author seems to think that printing and postage are free. A better title would be ""Guerrilla Marketing for Free or Low Cost."" But this book should be on every small business owner's list. Excellent suggestions are made for marketing plans that are within anyone's ability."
5,A must have for the savvy marketer,"All books from Jay are concise and precise and this one gives the reader a wealth of precious information.I was a complete marketing failure until I read Jay's books on marketing and learned about all of his unconventional weapons & strategies. By far the most powerful marketing information ever revealed. A definite must have for any serious marketer!Dan Hamilton,Certified Guerrilla Marketer, proudly affiliated with Jay Conrad Levinson's Guerrilla Marketing Associationhttp://metamorphosis.0catch.com"
1,Not really Dozens of tactics,"I bought this book thinking I was going to a list of tactics that were going to be innovated and creative to help me promote one of my websites. This book was really vague and didn't offer any tactics. Most of the things listed were things that you already know like ""get involved in the community"", ""attend trade shows"" or others so out of reach like ""Make appearances on Talk Shows"". The book also needs some revising, they a section on taking advantages of free directories like Yahoo and Yahoo's directory hasn't been free for a long time (is only free if you are a non profit).This book is not for a website owner who is trying to promote a product. Save your money and read message boards. I have gotten more ideas that way than from this book."
2,Only disappointing Guerilla book I came across.,"Most stuff is not that free like participating in organizations and societies, one that free takes so much of your time that you better off working at minimum wage and hire a professional to do your PR. Invest your money on other Guerilla books (like Guerilla marketing) as you will never need this one.Bottom line: I bought it thinking to find marketing bargain, but it not what it sounds like based on name and description."
2,"OK, but more about attitude than marketing","Well, I am a big guerilla marketing fan, but this book just doesn't seem to go along with what the title promises. It is more about attitude and common sense things that you have probably already done (like come up with a title for your business). It isn't that its not good, it just isn't what I expected. I wanted bunches of free advertising scenarios, but this isnt it. Save your money and buy it at a yard sale or used."
3,"Nice to have, great moments, but not essential flamenco","Vicente's brilliant first outing, De Mi Corazon al Aire, is an outstanding application of modern sensibility and techniques to strict flamenco forms. It shows just how far flamenco can go and still be flamenco. Whereas this album, Vivencias, steps outside flamenco on several tracks and strays into muzak territory in the process.Vicente is always worth listening to - check him out on Tauromagia, a flamenco classic - but I hope he doesn't wander off too far into flaccid Liebert territory."
2,How the hell do you slow this thing down?,"As for this Twin Shock Game Pad from Game Elements of mine, it said TURBO, but I wasn't expecting light speed! Can someone tell me how to set this controller pad up so it wont keep automatically putting commands in for me? Every time I even touch the control pad when it's hooked up to my PS2, the buttons are too sensitive, and it keeps doing what I can only describe as ""hair-trigger buttons"" on it's own as though the turbo is out of control. Apparently I thought the sensitivity would start out normal and then I could set up the turbo on my own. Instead from the very beginning the control pad starts automatically putting all sorts of commands (triangle, squre, circle, etc.) into the game for me, so I can't play. Somebody please tell me how to set this pad up. I bought a second one just now and it does the same as the first one I bought. By the way, don't forget that neither package came with instructions, which is an even greater loss, what the hell???"
2,Zen vision M 60GB ok for 2 weeks then.....,"Zen vision M 60GB worked ok for 2 weeks then screen became washed out, sen't back to Creative and waiting for it to be sorted out, not a good start?"
3,60GB Vision:M does *not* record from the radio - don't believe Amazon description!,"I bought this thinking I could record from the radio with it. But this isn't possible on the 60GB version. You need the 30GB for that.Other than that, it's a good player. I wanted to synch my music, didn't pay attention to the synching process, and found it synched all my photos and videos too. It just vacuumed them all up. Hungry machine!It's a bit temperamental - having some sharp tweezers on hand with a very pointy point, for resetting the reset switch, is pretty essential."
3,Our units arrived with dead batteries,"Batteries dead on arrival. We suspect the units experienced extremely cold temperatures in transit, causing battery failure.We were very impressed with Amazon's no hassle return policy."
5,Zen Music,"Loading music and videos is a breeze; easy to learn and download pictures, music, and videos. Accessories are a bit expensive; wish they would include the dock; prodcut doesn't stand on its own."
5,I'm a happy Zenner,"Ordered mine here, had it now for about a week, very happy with it. Lots of music and learning how to rip DVDs on to it for a trip. However, the main reason I got it is the USB host feature, so I can backup my digital SLR RAW files to it. Haven't tried that, but plan to next week."
2,Buyer Beware - False Advertising!,"I recently purchased this model because it advertised the ability to record radio. This feature was missing when I opened it though. I E-Mailed customer service and the reply was ""Please be informed that Creative no longer supports the FM Recording feature."" It turns out after threat of lawsuit the new firmware for the 30 gig model has this feature back however for this 60 gig model the newest firmware lacks this option. If the ""Record Radio"" feature is important to you please contact Creative and ask them if and when this feature will be re-incorperated. For now, this feature is advertised and not available. Be warned."
5,"If they had a 6 star rating, I'd give it a 7.","I've toyed around with the Ipod video and this little gadget. The zen M is a little bulkier, but not by much. The resolutions is great, and the sound is even better. I primarily use it to store music videos and it works great with my mobile video. I even used it at a party with a big screen tv, and it turned out perfect. The one thing I wished was on here was a random switch/button/something for the videos. Like I said before, I use this for music videos, and to have to select a new video every song is a pain, but I haven't seen a portable media player with that feature to date. I'm not anti Ipod or pro Creative, but if you are, you should go with your choice respectively. This is a great little machine for the price. Just as a heads up, I've had this for about 6 months now, so I've had a chance to get used to it."
3,Creative Zen 60 GB,"I ended up returning my first one due to HW flaw. Returned the second one after 3 weeks of back and forth emails to Creative's pathetic tech support trying to figure out certain features.Returned my second one and purchased a Zune instead. Granted, the Vision M has great features on top of the fact that it was 60GB... but, at the end of the day, I want the thing to work!The Zune has an excellent user interface and the file system works well.Maybe next time Creative..."
1,Dead Unit,"I recieved this unit 3 bussiness days after I ordered it. Fast shipping.To bad when i recieved it it only worked for 2 minutes!!! Sending back tomorrow, not sure if i want another one. Only comes with usb charger, no wall charger."
4,"Great player, OS; Lack of accesories a drag","My Zen works great. The screen is fantastic with better colors than an Ipod, and I love the vertical scroll pad with the autoscroll function. The customizable shortcut key makes operating the Zen even easier.The only con to this player is Creative's lack of accesories for the larger 60GB version. They need to make more."
3,This lacks some features of the 30 GB model,"I bought the Zen Vision because I wanted to listen to music and to record FM broadcasts. I went with the 60GB model because I thought bigger was better. Although I like the MP3 player, I'm sorely disappointed by two things:1. This is slightly bigger than the 30GB model, so the 30GB Vision cases don't fit. I've been unable to find any cases to fit this model, even on the Creative website. That's pretty poor customer service, in my view.2. For unknown reasons, the 30GB model can record FM broadcasts, but the 60GB model can't. This is a subtle difference that isn't made clear in the promotional materials. You'd think the bigger and more expensive model would have more features, not fewer. Very poor product design and marketing."
5,Best Player Ever!,"This an amazing player. One of the best things that I found its the fact that you don't have to convert any file in order to import it to the player; in the case the format of the file its not handle by the player, it will be converted to a one that its handle by it.I had a little trouble playing videos since the player hang and I had to reset the player in order to get it working again. I updated the firmware an d problem solved. I have to say that creative's web page its really useful and has a lot of articles that may help with any problem.The resolution, the sound, the player itself its perfect. The only con that it has its that it is a little bit thick.I will really recommend this player, specially if you don't like ipods XD."
5,Amazing MP3 and Video Player,"I love this Zen. I shopped every player and this is the only one that had it all: reliability, huge capacity, great functionality and features (including fm radio), long battery life, excellent customer service, upgradeable firmware, excellent software for the PC interface, incredible large high-res display (and I didn't even care about the video), and it's not a propietary system (like Apple products)---it easily obtains and shares files. If you're shopping, you can stop looking for the best media player; this is it."
4,60GB MP-3,"The player worked fine for about three weeks after Christmas, when it was activated into use, then suddenly the screen became blurred and was unuseable after that. I am currentlly in the process of getting it exchanged, since the tech support could not get it reset/restarted and working properly. The process has been somewhat cumbersome to get satisfaction from the company."
4,Creative Labs Zen Vision: M 60 GB Portable Media Player Black,This is a wonderful product. I got it for my boyfriend for christmas and he absolutely loves it. It is a bit on the bulky side but it's worth it. Amazon had the best price out of all the tens of places I looked. They were fast about shipping it during the holiday too!
4,"It was musical heaven, but it died too young!","The Zen products I've owned (30 GB and 60 GB MP3 players) both featured powerful amps that gave a world-rocking sound experience, in combination with Bose headphones. I loved the ability to hear my music even on a noisy airplane at 30,000 feet. Crying babies and turbulence announcements were drowned out and replaced by ""musical heaven.""Unfortunately, it quickly developed a propensity to freeze up. This was especially tricky to manage if it froze while in key-lock mode. After the 3rd freeze I could not reset it again. After considering my support options with Creative and reading other reviews of what happened when folks tried to get Creative to stand behind their product, I trashed the player and decided to blacklist this manufacturer, only 6 months after buying it.I can no longer recommend this product at all. I have tried to change my stars rating from 4 to Zero, but it seems I cannot change the stars rating now."
3,good but far from ideal,"If you buy this player and want to watch video on it, don't forget the most important accessory. You can't find it on amazon, but you can get it for free. It is a toothpick, specially designed for the tiny reset hole.."
2,Creative Zen Vision M 60 gig version,"It's a lot bigger, it's as big as a 30gig vision m with a Rhino Skin case around it... I broke the LCD screen at work one day, but I can still control it by plugging it into my television. I see a replacement screen cost $120, maybe i'll get that. New creative zens are being released today, I'd get one of those instead."
4,Mostly pleased,"The headboard is pretty and is as advertised. I just had not realized that it was so ""short"". My mattresses are very thick (deep), so the headboard only rises a few inches above the mattress. I really needed a taller headboard. Lesson learned."
5,Best $6 I ever spent,This thing is awesome if you mess around with bike parts or small hardware at all. The magnet is stronger than I expected and works great for picking up loose stuff too. Seems like everytime I would take somthing apart I would loose a nut or something - no more!
4,Great product and vendor,"I really like this mug. Since it is ceramic, it only keeps drinks as hot or as cold as a regular coffee mug would. But, other than that it's a great mug! I was pleasantly surprised by the quick shipping. I received the product much quicker than expected. This is a great vendor!"
5,Bigger is better,. Nothing like a big cup of coffee to get your day started.I broke the first one and had to have another or my grand kids would have been upset with me.
1,Weak,"Weak. PFM can and has done much better.Nothing to remember...pleasant to run through and still superior to much that is coming from other bands, but too weak to recommend anything more than a cursory listen."
1,Found it difficult to read. Couldn't get past first page,"It doesn't read like a novel for sure. As a buyer with an obvious need, I was looking an answer from the first page. guess i have to finish the book before my problems could be solved"
5,"excellent, very insightful!","Read this book and share it with your partner if you can. It is so spot-on about communication, I really wish everyone would read it! The basic premise is explaining how we relate to each other and what happens when we don't respond in a way that potentiates that relationship. It's easy to understand, a great read. I especially recommend it if you are in a relationship that is not going well and BOTH of you are looking for help in fixing it. Read it together. It will help you understand each other. (I only wish it wasn't called The Relationship Cure because it's really about Communication!)"
5,Fantastic book,"I had read this book from the library first, so I knew it was a fantastic book. It really offers some true-to-life helpful ideas and strategies. I think John Gottman has gone beyond the obvious results of his years of research on couples, and applied it from many different ways and views of how couples can improve thier lives together. I bought it as a reference book, it's that helpful. Thanks for sending it along quickly, and it's in good shape too."
4,Great book for improving relationships,"This book offers great advice and tips for many different types of relationships. A good, easy read that can help many people feel better about their relationships and/or learn how to create better ones or improve existing ones."
4,Very helpful,This is an excellent guide to developing positive communication with your partner. It is insightful and easy to follow. I would recommend this book as a tool for all relationships.
4,"good content, small font","As always, John Gottman's books are wonderful and clear, providing tangible facts and tools for building a better relationship. I've grown so much just by reading his material. My only complaint about this particular book is that the print is SO small!! The small print makes the content more daunting and difficult to read. It must be about 8pt. font. This is thick reading to start with, but add the small font and it becomes arduous. I might buy the Kindle version just so I can enlarge the font. Don't worry...I'm not some old foggy with bad eyesight. Just a person that doesn't want to work so hard to digest this great information!"
2,Great for teen boys to enjoy...and to learn about bad writin,"I, like many who reviewed this series, got into this series when I was 16 years old. The inordinate amount of sex was surely a major aspect of my voracious reading of this series. As I look back, 14 years later, I ralize that Piers Anthony had a gift of coming up with some great plots. Yet he had to suffuse them with so much sex (and bad sex, may I say), which he does with virtually every book he writes, that the story just becomes soft porn books. Of course teen boys love it! But this is not real science fiction.The writing of Piers Anthony is mediocre at best, lacking in complex characters. His strength is good plots and knowing how to turn teen boys on."
2,Great at first and then it went dead!,"I loved this little machine, I received it as a Christmas gift in 2009 then suddenly after one year of use, on the 16th of December 2010 it stopped working. I cleaned the little section of the charger well, double cleaned the charger side of the hand held too, it just will not charge. I am so disappointed. The money was hardly worth use for a year."
2,DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGE - return policy???,I purchased this brush for myself about 6mths ago and loved it! I went ahead and bought another one for my husband. The brush doesn't hold a charge and it will beep to turn on and then double beep about 3 secs after. So it only works for those 3 seconds. I didnt save the box - how can I get this fixed? Or can I exchange it for a new onE???
1,steer clear money pit ahead,"Pretika ST236 Sonicdermabrasion Facial Care SystemI bought this item to help exfoliate dead skin from my 50's face. I was pleased with the unit, it had enough power to do the job without stopping and the two products seemed to be fine. When the 1 once exfoliating cream was gone I went to the web site for Pretika and ordered their replenishment kit, which means either two jars of the scrub or two tubes of the cream, all in 1 once containers. The price was a shock $18.00 for either kit totaling just two ounces. You cannot find their products in any store BTW< so your stuck. But get this the shipping 5-7 day ground from LA to Phoenix was $17.50 for a total of $35.50 for two ounces! Buy the lower priced scrubber and get the scrub from your local Wal-Mart. When you see the name Pretika, run very fast. For those who have made my mistake, buy the Olay smooth skin exfoliating scrub for $6.00 for a 6 once tube."
3,Still assessing product,"I like it. My only concern was the issue of the batteries dying/device becoming inoperable within a few months. So far that has not been an issue, although I have only been using it approximately a month. Due to skin problems (being treated by a dermatologist), i only use it once a week or so with the silica formula. I use it every other day with Cetaphil (doctor recommended). With all that, I have found that my skin is 70% better. I required the services of a dermatologist, but I believe the product can benefit average users well (for a home product, when regular services to a professional skin care spa is not possible. Hopefully the mechanical/battery issue will not pose a problem. It is a decent, budget-minded option. Disclaimer: I have not tried the OTC scrubbers from Nutrogena, Olay, etc. They may be just as effective without the sonic aspect."
1,Monstrous waste of money.,"This lasted me about a month before the battery died. It's similar to a more expensive skin care tool, and seems to function okay when first out of the box. But it's a terrible product and a waste of money -- the battery will refuse to charge after about 2 full charges. It includes a 30-day warranty -- that JUST fits the life of the battery. Horrible."
2,Pretika Facial Care System,I was very happy with this product and its performance until the battery stopped holding a charge; which was after the 3rd charge.Now it is useless. Until the company corrects the battery problem I would not waste my money purchasing it. Maybe someone needs to recharge the quality control department so they can do their job. What a disappointment.
5,great skin care,"This is a great product, it cleans, and exfolliates my skin beautifully.I am 48 years old and my skin had been looking dull and old for a while,since I started useing Pretika Sonicdermabrasion Facial Care System my skin is looking radiant and healthy. Thankyou for such a great product.SincerelyJeannie"
4,Peter Greens greatest hit is here,"Albatross - Actually a No 1 hit in EnglandBlack Magic Woman - Original (better) version than Santana'sNeed Your Love So Bad - ""BB"" King song, lose the string sectionI Believe My Time Ain't Long - ""Elmore James"" Done by Spencer, killer slideLike Crying -early version of Danny's 'then play on' song"
1,Don't Buy This Edition!,"This is a poorly formatted edition of the public domain translation available several places on the internet. This translation was heavily edited for the english language edition by Verne's publisher. For a new translation from the original french version, containing three more chapters, try ISBN 1-84282-080-x. It is more enjoyable reading."
3,A very flawed view of WW1,"Pity of war takes the position that Britain should have allowed Germany to violate Belgian neutrality. But then Britain's word would have no value in the future.Also he claims that there was no desire of the British public to join in the war. That was true until the Germans violated Belgian neutality. After the violation, public opinion in Britain was definately anti-German and Pro Entente."
4,Pendulum of revisionism swings right....,"Rather than trying to cover the entire war, this book focuses on various problems, myths and misconceptions about the war. No matter what your previous views on the history of this era, this book is guaranteed to annoy, rattle and inspire you -- he has something to offend everyone's favorite theory, from left to right. Even when you don't accept his sometimes questionable conclusions, the process of getting there is well worth it."
4,Thought provoking,"Like other reviewers here, I have my doubts about whether Ferguson's analysis is correct but his book absolutely should be read if for no other reason than the critical analysis that it forces on the reader when other books about World War I are read. Even if his conclusions are wrong, the considerations he puts forth must be included in any intelligent appraisal of the War, its causes and its aftermath. Interestingly however, they typically are not."
4,Great collection of essays,"This book doesn't necessarily hang together as a coherent unit, but it is an excellent collection of essays about the Great War. Trying to make sense of the slaughter of millions of young men for absolutely no reason and no cause is certainly difficult, and the author should be commended for allocating the blame equitably among the butchers, particularly the U.K. As an American, it's taken for granted in history fed to kids growing up that we were on the right side and that we had a reason for being involved in that senseless orgy of death. So it's nice to see an account of some of the major issues that cuts through the propaganda and assigns the proper blame to Britain and fat, old, stupid, drunken idiots like Churchill who had no problem sending an entire generation to die for no good reason."
2,FLASK,THIS FLASK WAS RETURNED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD LEAVE SPIRITS IN IT FOR ONLY A SHORT TIME.
2,Back to Paperport 9,"I'm a huge fan of Paperport 9; I use it extensively. I was excited to see an upgrade and recently installed PaperPort 10. While the split screen and other features are a nice improvement, the software seems very buggy.The biggest problem for me is that I can no longer scan multiple page items using an HP OfficeJet scanner. I spoke with their technical support about this issue and was informed that ""PaperPort 10 is not as good as PaperPort 9 at scanning and stuff."" These were the exact words of one of PaperPort's support engineers. At least this engineer was kind enough to tell me how to best uninstall version 10."
2,Functional but not worth the expense,"Let me say it simply -If you had to pay $200 for a Professional version of a program, wouldn't you expect great features, simplicity of use and excellent performance?Paperport 10 does not offer any of these things. Scansoft has really dropped the ball in the last 2 versions. There are some other options out there. Not as feature rich as Scansoft claims Paperport 10 is but many are FREE!!!Check out Open Source websites for free programs like PDF Creator.Don't waste $200 on this steaming pile of s#*t!"
1,Poor Quality,I was looking for the Wearever version of this and upon conducting the search this showed up. Poor quality and it was dente/very pliable.Run for the hills when you see this piece of garbage.
1,disappointed,I am very disappointed in this product. For several yrs I have been using non-stick and found the only one to stand up to cooking for a large family is Farberware and old fashion cast iron. After many tries I have decided to go back to the cast iron cookware. It is just as expensive as some non-stick and less than others but always there to perform. It does not scratch during the first few weeks of use....or ever. Now days you REALLY need to get your monies worth.
3,"Average pan, with a major warping issue","I have owned this pan for almost a year now. This is my only frying pan, so it gets a fair amount of use.Pros:- The handle is made of a soft, grippable material.- The nonstick coating is staying on pretty well.Con:- The pan warped almost immediately. The metal of the pan is pretty thin, so it's no surprise that it warped.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a little more money on a thicker pan."
3,Kind of flimsy,This jumbo cooker is okay. It is very light and does not cook as evenly as the T-fal pan I bought. I should have bought the T-fal version of this pan instead.
5,Really like this pan alot,This pan is really nice. I just recieved it a couple days ago. I have used it alot already . I have cooked bacon in it with the see threw and steam release lid on it. Worked really nice and I had no grease to clean up either. Cooked scrambbled eggs in it worked great no sticking no mess just wipe it clean. I love this pan. I take skin off Itailian sausage before I cook it sticks on my old pan but not on this pan. The price of this pan is reasonable to. Thank you very much a very happy customer
2,You get what you pay for...,"This pan has some good qualities. Nice non-stick surface, even heating, great size. The draw back? I've had this pan for about 3 months. I've used it 1-2 times per week. The handle has started to loosen. And tonight I discovered that the bottom is starting to warp, as it will no longer sit flush on my stove. I have a Calphalon pan that is almost identical to this one. I have had it for almost 2 years and it is still in perfect condition. As I said, you get what you pay for."
2,Good Music But Not What I Was Looking For,"I am a guitar player. I was looking for a video that would ""teach"" me FingerStyle Acoustic methods. Instead, it's just some people playing the guitar. They're very good guitar players, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I am probably to blame for my disappointment."
5,I love this story..wish it was a memoir,"I love this story, I wish it was a memoir, but that would mean it would have to be true. and there is enough going on in the world today , we don't need this story to be one that is seenon the news. However, it IS a very good read. I suggest that organizations that deal with children who were abused and neglected need to read this book, it relates to the childrne. It makes the reader keep reading to find out what happens to the little boy. I am older than a teen, but study things for children. I think this is a good teen or adolescent read for children who have been through this situation.Has a great ending, you will love it"
4,Great Book!,I think this book deserves this award. It is a great book but not the best I have ever read. I think this book was a little depressing but at the same time joyful. This book is suspenseful. If you like suspense you'll love this book. I would recommend this book to ages 11 and up and anyone who loves dramatic endings.
4,"A very disciplined read, but very worth it.","Gilson's work on the philosophical side of Aquinas is a masterful work. It reflects a very mature appreciation of Aquinas, which serves as a very good basis for his exposition of the philosophical side of Aquinas's theological work. Make no mistake, it takes a very focused reading to appreciate the extremely subtle insights that lay at the heart of Aquinas's reflections on Being. Without such a disciplined readying the exposition will dissolve into seeming endless, nuanced abstractions that even Gilson will not be able to surmount for you. Bringing such dedication to the reading will reward you with nothing less than Beauty and a true appreciation for why Aquinas is ""Saint Thomas Aquinas""."
5,New to Frescobol,"I bought these racquets recently and am very pleased. They are significantly better than the cheap kits you buy at local department stores. They are extremely sturdy with a very comfortable rubber-like grip. If nothing else, they come in very cool colors and designs. I've actually got 4 raquets now... all of different styles.The game is real easy and can be played almost anywhere and by anyone ... you certainly don't need to be an expert. I've played on the beach as well as in my back yard.Hope this review was helpful."
3,Yodora cream,The only objection I have is that the Yodora cream feels gritty and grainy when I apply it. I don't know if it is beyond the sell-by date or what.
2,Flat as a flippin pancake,"What happened to this one ... hows come is sounds so dead. Awful production. Someone pressed the 'suck all the life of it' button. I've noticed this on the occasional Incognito recordings before. Some releases are really bright and sharply recorded and produced, but this isnt one of them. It is not a Cd that will flatter your hifi - in fact the opposite. Its makes your nice posh system sound like a rank old bit of kit. Skip it. Poor. Next."
5,Nell Nugget and her little dog dust save the day and goldie the cow,"Such a delightful read. You and your child will get hours of fun reading this wonderfully whimsical book about how Nell Nugget and her little dog Dust save Goldie, her best cow from Nasty Galoot. Comes with adorable squishy toy cows so your child will have his or her own herd to go along with the delightful story.Nell Nugget and the Cow Caper"
1,Like something from Nickelodeon,"This book was written like it should be for children. It's very hard to read because it's formatted like a third grade English book. This is not a good book to learn HTML, CSS, or XHTML with, not even as a starter book.I can truly say this book was the most disappointing book I have ever bought. I'm sorry to be so negative, but this book is just ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
1,SLOOOOOOOOWWWWWW,"I TEND TO CRITISIZE THOSE WHO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT A BOOK, BECAUSE A BOOK SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR JUST BEEN OUT THERE, BUT I COULD NOT LET THIS ONE SLIP BY.THIS BOOK IS EXTREMILY SLOW, YOU OPEN A GRAPHIC IN PAGE 5 FOR INSTANCE AND SEE THE SAME GRAPHIC IN PAGE 267 WITH THE SAME BLOCK SCROLLED TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME. THE AUTHOR WORKS WITH A PORTAL UGLIER THAN THE ONE EBAY HAS.THE FIRST LIKE 270 PAGES TALKS ABOUT HTML WITH A COUPLE OF TAGS REFERED OVER AND OVER AND OVER.IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NICE SITES YOU SEE OUT THERE.VERY SHALOW CONTENT, (NOT EVEN THE JOKES ARE WORTH THE BOOK)SORRY GUYS, NOW I CAN SLEEP BETTER AT NITE."
3,Basic intro to HTML and Css,"For beginners, this would be a great book, but I was hoping for a bit more depth. I only got benefit from the last 100 pages."
4,A Great Book.,"Many people have complained about the fact that this book is for those with ADD, that it is too much fluff, or that the pictures look like their from Nickelodeon. For someone like me however, this is a great book.No the book isn't as deep as some would like, but for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with XHTML & CSS, this is a great way to get started. For me it is important to know why something is done a certain way, why it is important. Head First does a great job at answering the ""so what"" of some basic things in web design. Because of that, I have a much easier time to learn it. I'm not ADD or watching Nickelodeon, but this book was a great help in getting me started on web design. If you are looking for advanced web design lessons, move on, but if you are just new to this thing and the ""so what"" is important, I'd highly recommend it."
5,I read the whole book!,"I don't know how many of these ""learning type"" books I have bought and only got 1/4 of the way through before I put it down and picked up another. Not to say I have no attention span, but this book really taught me something on every page. I have gone on to mastering .NET and java because of the basic knowledge that I recieved from reading this text. I recommend this book for anyone that wants to know basic html and css and how the internet works."
5,"Clear, easy and accessible reading.","I am only adding to all the good things that have already been said about this book. The book was never overwhelming nor intimidating. It broke down concepts in way even the most amateur of people could understand. And, the reading was actually a little entertaining."
5,Head First HTML with CSS &XHTML,"This is by far the best intro book for html, css, and xhtml. In fact who would believe that that an instructional computer language book would be enticing enough to lure you back after a session of study because it was fun...Who said that...Did I say that?!?!If you would have asked me before this book if that was possible I would have thought not. In the past books on topics such as this resulted in a fine night's sleep after a few pages. This one kept me up at night thinking so there you go one of the down sides is, it is not an effective sleeping aid. To those just starting to learn these skills I highly recommend the W3C schools free tutorials to accompany this book."
5,The best introduction,"I must admit I was surprised at how wonderful this book was. I read it from cover to cover in 5 days. I feel like I now have a very good grasp on XHTML and CSS.When I read the introduction, I was skeptical about the methods used to teach in this book. But then I realized that because so many teaching methods were used congruently, I learned faster and retained more information in less time than I have with the type of books I usually prefer: dry and directly on point with no personality.I was a little bothered by the curse words used in the book. But as a teaching text, it was excellent. Examples were clear and visible as well as verbally explained. Concepts were also visually represented and verbally explained. And both examples and concepts were shown visually and verbally explained a few different times in a few different ways. I think you get the point.I highly recommend this book and will purchase from O'Reilly again as a result of this book."
4,"Great beginners book, but the index is pitiful!","This book will explain the basics of CSS and HTML so that the reader will finally understand it inside and out. But the index lets you down. How could the authors and contributors, so thorough in everything else, have forgotten to make a comprehensive index? Other than that, it's a great book."
4,I used my head with Head First,"Although I haven't finished the book yet, it definitely makes it simple to learn HTML and how to program web sites. This is something that would usually make me yawn and fall asleep, but they keep it light and interesting."
4,Land on your feet,"Well written, an interesting approach to explaining the how to's of robust design with a fun and light hearted attitude."
5,Highly recomended,"I read the book from cover to cover (all 650 pages) in less than a week, and it really got me up to speed on CSS (which is what I was most interested in). It was so good that I bought another copy for one of my coworkers and another for my son (I wasn't about to give away mine)."
5,Very well written,The style of this book aids remembering the material. It's actually fun to read and do the homework. I find myself looking forward to reading the next lesson.
2,Really really slow,"I read this book so I could pick up HTML 5. I decided that I want to do some web pages and take a break from applications. HTML 5 looks fun. So I picked this book and this book has info but it really makes you grind through the book to get to it. It's really slow paced. I like how it has pictures, but there is limit. After a point it's like the book speaks to you like it thinks you take an hour to comprehend something. Just give a topic and move on. You don't need to drag something 5 times for another 50 pages, literally. I read 100 pages for the past 3 days and still have my webpage the same as it was in page one. Matter a fact, after page one you barely write code, you just grind read the same topic over and over again. This is first my review. I never thought I'd write a review, but seriously, how stupid do you think we are? We get it, move on. This isn't Jersey Shore."
1,Skips page locations in Kindle edition,"Is the Kindle edition supposed to skip from location 1624 to 1636? I can only get to location 1625 by manually keying in the digits after selecting ""Go to"" from the menu.I just returned my copy from Feb 15, made a repurchase five minutes ago, and I'm still having the same issue.Is anyone else having this problem?"
5,"A little cheesy at times, but in a good way","I've tried several websites and other books to try and begin learning HTML/CSS. Every time I start one, my interest begins to dwindle and I can't finish. Head First is the first book I have managed to finish. They kept it interesting and took some of the monotonous work out by providing you with some pre-written content. I thought this might detract from the learning at first, but discovered that it makes you focus on the more important aspects and rewards you with fast progress. By the end of the book, you will be proud of yourself for how much you've learned in a very short time. I think my next book may be diving into PHP and MySQL with Head First. If you are new to HTML, definitely give this a try and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Get To the Point, Please","This book contains a lot of good information about using HTML and CSS to create functional, stylish web pages; the authors apparently know the subject matter very well. However, this manual ""beats around the bush"" far too much in trying to make the information ""fun and entertaining."" I did not buy this book to be entertained; I bought it to get educated. Many pages contain nothing more than empty whitespace and corny, useless depictions. This publication contains about 700 pages, but could easily be trimmed down to about 300 to 350 pages if the information was presented in a more direct and concise format. The Freemans should stop trying to be funny and entertaining because they are NOT good it. They should stick to teaching HTML and CSS because I think they would be very good at that - once they eliminate all of the useless drivel."
2,280 pages to get to an IMG tag.,"This book could be cut down to a small pamphlet with no loss of information. 90% of it is pure fluff. It takes almost 300 pages to get to an .I recommend it for anyone who enjoys 4 pages of pretend conversation between anthropomorphic HTML tags.Lastly, my final complaint is that the crosswords at the end of each chapter, which seemed like a neat idea, only contain 3 or 4 actual questions regarding the subject matter (which is mainly die to each chapter having very little actual content). The rest of the puzzle is made up of non-information and puns. For example: ""which style tags do the authors WISH existed? The answer is some joke about the 50s."
3,BEGINNER BOOK,"This book is definitely for beginners. I found about 2 pages of pertinent/usable information on xhtml, I think the title of the book should remove the xhtml statement imho. It's style is a bit ""young"", meaning there is no serious tone to the book, probably good for someone with A.D.D syndrome :) I am giving this book 3 stars because it does, in fact, contain all the basics for html web design and it keeps it very simple. I took away 2 stars because I was expecting a more advanced book with more css + xhtml and the format was somewhat aimed at a younger audience."
1,Too much clutter,"There may be some valuable information in this book, but I couldn't see past all the clutter. Many pages are broken up by a host of info-tainment elements, including unrelated nostalgic pictures, deadpan comics, puzzles, handwritten notes and arrows all over the place, sidebars, and others. So the layout was a real turn-off. Some may prefer this mix. But if you just want the plain facts with some helpful tutorial material this is not the ""6-star"" book the most visible reviewers suggest.CSS: The Missing Manual is an exceptional CSS tutorial and uses the kind of clean, straight forward approach I expected from this HTML book."
5,"Buy this book, now!!!","This is not a reference book however it is an INDISPENSABLE learning tool!!! Even if you are a beginner or have been designing for awhile and want to learn to do it the ""right"" way, please, get this book! I paid around $40 for it and it was worth every penny!"
4,Good book for beginners,"Fun and interactive book for beginning Web designers. Even if you don't know HTML and CSS but are computer-savvy it's a bit slow at the beginning. But it then picks up and has you working on all kinds of projects that will help you in real-world situations. However, good luck later on finding specific commands using the index. It doesn't go into enough detail so you'll have to use the table of contents to find the command you're looking for."
4,Excellent Refresher,"I've been writing/editing/producing/managing sites for more than 15 years. I wanted to get up to speed with the newer HTML5 pages just so I could understand the funky styles better and how to build them (not just fix them). I'm self-taught or piecemeal taught based on work needs, so I never had a cohesive structural narrative and actually find the little notes adorable. Plus, even though I'm significantly further ahead than the usual audience, getting an easy narrative is very useful.Honestly, after years of CMS lethargy, it's easy to forget the basics. This is an easy, user-friendly book that brings them back as needed (and is easy to gloss over as needed when you are far beyond certain skill sets). And it's much more accessible than a smug, design-heavy/content-lite Wordpress blog about design creation that has poorly-written ""tips"" from idiot Millennials."
4,Great Book with Good Examples,"Great book, especially for a beginner. There are actually 3 projects that you work on through out the book and they are clear and easy to understand. My intent was to use this book for an HTML class I teach and when I emailed the publisher for a copy of the book to review for adoption I was denied as they do not waste their time with middle school and high school classes. They must be unaware of the fact that kids in grades 7-12 are the ones studying about computers and web design more than adults."
1,A Whole Lot of Nothing,"Just how stupid do these people think we are?I hate this book. Like the other one-star reviewers, I find the cartoony illustrations and jaunty hand-printed notes in the margins to be wildly distracting. I don't like having to sift through the intentional repetitions of the concepts just because other readers might have to read something 3 or 4 times before they absorb it. I don't, and if I do need to go over something again, I'd rather just go back and review instead of being forced to read the same thing phrased or staged in three different ways.This is the assigned textbook for an HTML class that I'm taking, and I'm going to complain to the instructor, too."
1,Ugly and unsporting,I absolutely hated the way this book was written. The layout was scattered and information was repeated too much. I felt ripped off. Like someone deliberately filled a book with half-baked ideas just to up the page count and price.I was originally going to give this book 2 stars. After reading other reviews I found that someone related to this book is attacking reviewers. That makes me trust the author and associates even less. 1 STAR.YOU CAN BUY TWO GOOD BOOKS FOR THE PRICE OF THIS REMEDIAL TEXT.
5,Excellent Women friendly book,"This book uses positive images of women, which was so refreshing and engaging, I actually thought yeh I want to be like those people who know HTML! There are many very helpful varieties of teaching techniques throughout the book.They almost trick you into learning!Before I knew it I had my first website designed and ready to fly! Thank you HEAD FIRST! I will be looking at your other titles now!"
1,I cannot stand this book,I see by all the other reviews that most people really like this book. I absolutely hate it. I don't like how the information is presented or organized. I have to use it for a college class and dread having to read the rest of it. I cannot recommend it whatsoever.
4,HTML FOR THE COMPUTER NOVICE,"This text is somewhat difficult for the computer novice. However it does take one very slowly through the steps required to start writting code. The explanations areclear and straight forward. For learning how to write code for the web, this is the place to start."
4,Very easy to understand,"This book is great for anyone with little knowledge of HTML and CSS. It is presented in a unique, fun and easy to use way.Highly recommended."
2,Sloppy testing of first exercise diminishes book's usefulness,"When I purchased this book I wanted more than a hip, new-age way of getting me to absorb the material, I wanted the exercises in the book to work. Like myself, the 30 or so other reviewers were influenced to purchase the book by the pictures, cartoons, and sometimes irreverent prose. None of us could test out the book's exercises in the store. I can't vouch for the other reviewers, but once I got the book in front of my computer I began at the beginning and in the first exercise, Uh oh, problems. I am not alone. One just has to go to the HeadFirstLabs online forums to read that the exercise apparently wasn't tested on the world's most popular browser, IE6. If the first, and what logically should prove to be the simplest exercise in the book is flawed, what disappointments and frustrations do the following 620 pages have in store for us IE users."
2,style over substance,"This is the first ""head first"" book I've read, and unfortunately it will probably be my last.I actually don't have a problem with the material covered in the book. It seems pretty complete. But to me, having to wade through all the ""cutsie-poo"" little pictures and notes and jokes and all that just leads to a book that is difficult to pick up and find the info you need. I suppose if your goal is to be amused, then by all means pick up this book. But if what you are trying to do is learn so that you can accomplish something in an effecient way, then I'd definitely buy something different.I'll leave the ""head first"" book to the teens, I want my medicine ""straight up"" and strong, not watered down like this."
5,Should Have Started Here,"I will keep my review simple. I have needed some HTML and CSS for one project or another over the years but have never held steady with it. I picked this book up as a refresher on some items and was blown away by its unique take on teaching a programming language. I wish I would have started here years ago! It was honestly a pleasure to read while most books of this nature are a labor simply to finish. I would recommend this to anyone, and look forward myself to picking up some of Head First Labs books on other topics."
5,Book,The book arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape. I will use this seller in the future if the books are available. Thanks.
1,"good book series, not so good for html","The head first series is really good, and simplifies things that can be complicated. however, that being said, HTML & CSS are not a subject that requires 800 pages, it really can be learned fairly quickly. The book goes on and on about such minute details that just make it more boring as it is, it is so basic that by the time you get done you only learn a few tags and almost no css. Anyone with half a brain would be able to learn html in a few days, don't waste all the time reading this book, thats ofcourse if you plan on going to sleep."
5,wow good book,"I book this book wanting to learn more about websites. At first I was a little skeptical/regretful about buying the book until I started reading it. I must admit i'm only on page 76, but so far the book has blown my mind. At first glance the cover may look like the book is a bunch of technical jargon thats going to overfill your mind, but once you start reading it you know that the 'head first' part of the title really means 'your going to learn this and its going to be fun'. I have started to learn how to make webpages and it has been fun. If you want to learn how to make web pages this is definately a friendly and fun (i'm not just saying that I'm enjoying learning through the book, and its jargon free' way to do so. Great book, 5 stars, exceeded my expectations."
4,Great help in updating my sites ancient HTML,"I've got several hand-coded HTML websites as well as other HTML code (a textbook on CD, for instance). This book was all I needed to upgrade my skills to the latest XHTML and CSS and revise my sites for better appearance.It's only fault is that it would be nice if it had a quick reference table of all the tags. Now I need to purchase a reference book as well because the book's organization makes it fairly worthless as a reference once you complete the tutorial."
4,Head First for Dummies?,"I only just started reading but I like the ""work your way thru it"" style. It reinforces the mental with the practical."
4,HeadFirst HTML - easy & informative,"Like most of the Head First books, this is very readable and has lots of information to help understand the ""why"" behind the technology.For some, the 1st couple of chapters may be too much of an ""idiot's guide"" but overall, the book is really good for if you want to understand how to write good HTML, XHTML and CSS.Note: if you are looking for language reference book, this is not the right choice."
4,Great tutorial - will give you the basics,"To learn HTML / CSS, you will probably need three books 1) a book to help you learn the topic; 2) a reference; 3) a book that describes the hacks and tricks for getting your own designs to work in various browers. This book does an excellent job of covering the first topic. It does not bill itself as a book for experts, or a reference.It's well written in an engaging way that turns a potentially dry topic into a more conversational read. It has useful examples that are well-presented and that continue and build throughout the book. Examples are accomanied by sidebars and out-takes that break up the format in an engaging way that helps understand the material, why things work the way they do, alternative designs and their trade-offs.My only gripe about the book and the reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that it seems to side-step the browser compatibility issue."
1,Don't Buy It!,"This book is a huge rip-off! It has only 7 pages, and says basically the same thing as the ""Helpful Hints"" booklet that came with the Rubik's Cube, except it doesn't have any pictures. I bought it as a gift for my son, and now the seller won't let me return it. USELESS!!!"
2,More drying than sulfate shampoo,"It dried my hair out and it made it hard to detangle. I had to use a good conditioner with slip in order to get the tangles out. I have 3b, 3c, 4a hair and I sectioned my hair off and placed it on my scalp. I massaged it in. After I rinsed, my hair was a matted mess."
5,Yes its good quiet its not,Great 80's action flick. Think of Patrick Swayze in this role and you get the idea. Remar was probably third or fourth choice but he was good in the lead. This is a great grade B movie all the way. Just love the feel and look of the movie. Love it!!!!!!!
3,Priced too high for the return,You get very little coffee for the cost. I found an awesome sampler at Blanchard's Coffee - 20 oz of coffee for 1/2 the cost of this. It's freshly roasted and the flavor is unbelievable.
5,Excellent Coffee,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas, and the box was in great shape. He is very satisfied. This is very good coffee."
1,This rating is for presentation - I did not taste product,I purchased this as a Christmas gift. The customer reviews sounded great. The picture shows what looks like a gift box of assorted coffee. What arrived was a cardboard shipping box filled with bags of coffee. There was no nice gift box. I must now find some sort of gift box or basket so this can be given as a Christmas present.
5,#1 in Customer Service,"The coffee I ordered for my mom never arrived, but it's UPS's fault, not this company's. I wrote Rogers Family Co asking for help and UPS contacted my mom the very next day. UPS was incredibly rude and basically accused her of lying asking why she never filed a police report if her goods were stolen. Well, we were ready to just write this off and get her something different, but Rodgers Family Co called my mom the same day and apologized for UPS and offered to send another order free of charge, even making it to where she had to sign for it through UPS. The woman my mom spoke to was incredibly nice and made everything good again. This is a great company."
2,Very good coffee don't - beware of delivery,I ordered the coffe sampler pack on 1 September 2006. Delivery estimates were from the 6-12 sep. This arrived on the 14th I would not have even cared if it was not a gift for someone. I ordered 3 items off amazon the first 2 were at the house within 4 days and the coffee was no where to be seen. I would warn you there seen to be a lot complaints in the feed back section read through it before buying.Again the coffee is very good
4,Plain box but outstanding coffee!,"I bought this as a Christmas `05 present for my sister. It does come in a plain box that gets a bit dinged during shipping, which is the only reason this was downgraded from 5 stars. But the coffee is terrific! Admittedly, we only tried the Irish Creme one, but one could taste quality coffee beans that surely are the same ones in all the blends. If I had known how good it was, I would have ordered a couple boxes, darn it."
2,Extech RH520A temp recorder,"The batterys died within 5 days, not sure if batterys where lemons or not since they came with the recorder.Can not retrive data since the connector cord cannot interface due to defective cord, at least the Extech tech surport was kind enough to send one under warranty, Day 5 and still waitingWhile on the phone with tech surport he susgested going with less expensive recorders that you plug into a UCB port and down load data, really wish I would have gone with those but I am not sure if good or bad since we have to confrim calabration.Not really happy but not unhappy. Once I down load and re test battery life I may add more input to this review"
2,Classic literature classically bad...,"I thought the book was a fun read and went rather quickly, but as most mystery novels of the era the lack in depth to the plot and characters diminishes the story. Maybe i just hated the abysmal ending, but hey i will leave that for others to critic."
2,Long story,"I couldn't get into the book and still haven't finished reading it. It has been months. I usually can't put a book down, but I couldn't make myself pick this one back up. It has a dark feeling about it."
1,Boring,I did not even bother to read this after the first few pages. I cannot waste time on books that do not develop the characters or plot in any depth.
4,Great psychological suspense story,"Although written in the latter part of the 19th century, this writer captures the inner workings of people living even 100 years before that, and guess what? Nobody has changed much. What makes this story worth reading is the writer's attention to minute detail, mostly inner workings, and a plot that she carries forward through several years that the story takes place."
3,Unusual,"This book was very interesting I read it and the twists during the book were not expected, I think it could be a interesting read for someone on a cold winter night."
3,An OK read,"I am sure on its time, this novel had provoked quite a lot of thrill and excitement. For today's readers who are exposed to much more complex thriller stories, this story is predictable, not at all scary, and kind of boring. On the positive note, I finished it!"
1,Didn't like it,Sorry I felt it took too long to come to an end - didm't like it at all won't read her again
5,Pokemon Firgure,This is a nice toy - my daughter loves Pokemon and liked getting this figure since I couldn't find it in stores.
1,Blah blah blah,"There are many good books about motivation and personal growth - this one is definately not one of them. When reading it I had a vision of Tom Cruise from the Magnolia movie - someone selling worthless words to people wanting to hear them. Luckily it is short - after all how many pages can you fill constantly repeating ""Dont be a victim - own your life""."
4,Easy to Read.......Eye Opener!,"I really enjoyed this book, I looked forward to reading it each night before I went to sleep. It is written very simple....but yet it forces you to think. I hope someday to catch him at a live speaking engagement......great pick me up book."
5,inspiring!,"thought it was a very good book, very inspiring, very true.....i will read it again and again and take a little more with me each time I read it..."
1,"Vague, generic, misleading","Just read a few pages and left the book because it just reads like any other generic book about which tries to deal with personal transformation, confidence, etc. I found it too vague, using lots of words to say simple things, doesn't get to the point, and does not really provide new ideas and recommendations. I did not like it at all. Sorry."
2,It's really an autobiography,"I felt this book is just a story of a part of Steve Chandler's life. He repeats the same point in each chapter, but with different examples. He compares two types of people, owners and victims. Victims aren't going to read this kind of book. What can owners do to change victims? He says to be the change you are trying to effect. But true owners are not in need of change, and he gives very few specifics on how an owner can help a victim. He doesn't encourage you to change until the last third of the book, and then only briefly, until he gets back into repeating himself. This is in no way a literary work, with it's informal style, and discontinuous nature. I do not recommend this book unless you just need some 'fill' reading. The very short chapters lend it to readers who have small amounts of spare time, such as breaks, or waiting in the car for a child, etc."
1,GOOD WRITER GOOD BOOK,I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK VERY PRACTICAL TO READ AS WELL AS HELPUL TO MY EVERY DAY LIFE.LIKE MANY PEOPLE I FIND UNEXPLAINABLE THAT THE WRITER IS UNDERESTIMATED AND USUALLY GET VERY FEW REVIEWS BY MOST CRITICS.
3,Beware of HAMILTONBOOKS audio cassette !,"For anyone interested in purchasing this audio book, please be advised that I've recieved not just One but TWO damaged versions of ""Reinvent Yourself"" and have given up. I will probably buy the book from the local bookstore. I don't think it's HamiltonBooks fault, but they must have some sketchy products in their inventory, you never know what you'll get. Maybe that's why this item is sold by them for the low price of $3.95 plus shipping. Just a warning..."
4,Good content...,"I like the content of this audio program, and have listened to it several times, a little bit at a time, on my way to and from work every day. The only problem is the author is the reader, and his voice is BORING! He should have hired a pro, because when I have to listen to him, it's easy to lose part of the message because of his lack of excitement. (It's also easy to fall asleep... Maybe he should have been a hypnotist!) Maybe I'm spoiled, because I like to listen to Top Peters on tape, and Steve Chandler just can't compare. The content of this program is so good, though, that I have to recommend it. You'll just have to endure the boring voice of the author. Maybe you should just buy the book instead."
4,Very insightful and an easy read.,"I found Reinventing Yourself to be a very interesting and insightful view on the many ways we can sabotage ourselves .... and how we can overcome that nasty tendency to be a victim and create our own bad situations. Steve Chandler has the kind of personal experience that makes the approach and suggestion legitimate, and having struggled with my own victim behaviors I can honestly say his wisdom shone through clearly for me.This is an easy read, and I was able to set down the book for a couple days and pick right back up where I left off without missing a beat. Readers from junior high school on up will be able to understand and apply Steve's concepts."
3,Some Good Stuff,"I don't really care for this genre of books. You know, the touchy-feely crap about you stare at your navel for a short period of time and magically transform yourself into the most amazing man/woman in the world. This book is a little different. The writing is entertaining, and the message that there is no magic bullet is sorely needed today. There are some useful kernels of insight here."
4,Against Depression -- Of course!,"The title suggests a political position of sorts, and much of the book deals with the suggestion that many people are for depression as an aid to artistic expression.The other parts of the book, that deal with new research showing physical damage to the brain and discussing causes of depression were extremely useful. For 40 years I have tried to explain to family members, doctors and psychiatrists that my depression has nothing to do with my mother; it's just an inapproprite reaction to normal stress. It's a physical defect of sorts that needs medication more than understanding. Attacks can be brought on by job stress, a virus, or no identifiable reason. This book is a great exposition on the physical effects of depression.I just wish the lengthy discussions about some perceived value of this disease had been confined to a page or two."
2,Against Depression,"The message that there is significant risk in treating depression as a problem of deviant temperment rather than as the physiological threat it presents is well taken. It does not require 291 pages of text to convey these extensively documented facts which are generally known to those of us interested in these matters, if not in such detail.The book lacked details of treatment protocols and outcomes.The broad suggestion that mental illness is best treated with a combination of therapy and medication is like a disclaimer. The main benefit of therapy is to provide emotional support which encourages the adherence to the prescribed medication protocol. No mental illness has ever been cured with therapy. Also, there is little mention about alternative treatments or future treatments such as TMS. This book is not comprehensive."
5,Kramer does it again!,"In this new book, Kramer explores the findings from the latest important research on depression. From thoughts on how patients modify medication doses for depression as they wouldn't for purely physical diseases to future possibilities of genetically modified stress hormone transmitters that could work to prevent a slide into chronic depression, he takes the reader on an enlightening journey through what matters.Another new book I enjoyed immensely of late is called ""The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book"""
2,Slow going,"The author certainly knows about depression, but in this book his prose style and frequent tangents slow the reader down and are little more that detractors and fillers. You wonder if he is writing for himself: has he fallen in love with his writing style so that as many sentences as possible can be sretched out beyound usefulness. His message gets lost in these elongated thoughts, elaborate case histories that are overdrwwn as if he intends a shore story. See,for example case of the women who could not get her laundry done.His effors at style are overwrought and interfert with a clean message that is easibly followed.The CD is not any better option and should not be played while driving."
2,Steve Colbert as a psychiatrist,"While Dr. Kramer did achieve success with his book on Prozac, it seems that he is taken by a sense of self importance that is as odd as his incessant need to use as many little known words as he is able to find.The narrative is relevant and on topic but could be reduced by a small fraction without any loss.This material may be interesting to a foreign academic looking to learn useless words in the English language or more likely to a insomniac.To his credit, the frequent references to his own success are funny but not enough to make this item sell for more than the 44 cents plus shipping I paid for it (new and shrink wrapped)."
3,something odd I noticed,"I'll qualify this by admitting that I'm only about halfway through this book right now. But it strikes me as strange that every single one of the case histories that Kramer describes in the first few chapters is about a female patient. Also, in the chapter entitled ""Eros,"" Kramer devotes almost the entire discussion to talking about the erotic power that female depressives hold over non-depressed males. (He mentions the reverse scenario only in passing.)As a woman, this really stood out to me. As far as I have noticed so far, Kramer makes no attempt to explain why he often slips into talking as if depression were mainly a feminine affliction. This way of talking strikes me as pernicious. It harks back to the earliest days of psychiatric medicine, when the discipline was deeply sexist. (For example, the word ""hysteria"" is related to the Latin word for ""uterus."")Anyway, this just seemed weird to me."
4,Fun & interesting read,"I'm not a big country music fan, ok I never listen to it, but I did really enjoy this book. Some of the funny parts got a bit too silly for me, so only 4-stars, but the plot was great and the author kept me wanting to read all the way to the last page. The story was homey, even though there was an interesting plot it wasn't the kind of story that stresses me out. Hard to explain... anyways, I really enjoyed it and will see if she has written any other books."
4,Let's go to Nashville,This was a fun to read book. The music brought them together to make them a strange loving family. This book makes you want to visit the Duedrop Inn 's next Saturday night.
4,FUN reading,FUN LIGHTHEARTED. Very enjoyable. Never got boring. I love books that make you laugh. Great read when you want something that isn't serious.
2,"Not very good, but it has a lot of heart","And My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You is not a very good book; the plot is thin, the characters mostly stock, and sometimes the strain for comic effect is just too painful to bear.BUT.There's such a nice spirit in this book, an open-hearted warmth, that you might just like it in spite of itself. She nails the bar band atmosphere, and the camaraderie of people who play music together into the wee hours, and she treats her characters with kindness and humor even when she's having them do ridiculous things.Mildly amusing, light, warm-hearted--so it's not literature. There are worse ways to kill a few hours and Kathi Kamen Goldmark is pretty good company, even it is just a road relationship that isn't going to go anywhere."
5,Oh My God! So funny!,"What a hilarious story! This book made me laugh out loud, and I'm not even a country music fan. Start reading this book when you have a good chunk of time - you won't be able to put it down!"
2,Typical show-business memoir,"I had to work to read this one to the end. Showcases a quirky family, with some interesting content behind the scenes of country music. However overall it disappointed -- I didn't come away with any memorable impressions of what it must be like to live and work in this business."
1,Condescending and painful,"Who gave this a good review??? Never give a review less than 3, but feel like the reviews on this book to give it a 4 were a set up. Blech."
3,"Ok, but too short","A nice entry in the musclecar color history series, but too few pages to cover this range of models over so many years. For example one book in this color history series covers Mustang over only just 1979 to 1998. There are better recent books on the Firebird, Trans Am that cover all the models."
3,Just Ok - Pictures aren't Bad,"I own a '75 Trans Am and expected more ""meat"" on the bone than this book delivered. It's sort of a soft cover coffee table book - looks nice with nice pictures, but the content isn't stellar. With all the popularity of the Trans Ams and Firebirds, there has to be better out there. Lamm's older book from the early '80's is a much better choice if you can find it used."
4,One of the better books.,"There arent many books published on these cars so when I bought this books I found it to be better than I expected.This book is published by Motorbooks Internatinal so you know its a great book.These ""Muscle car color"" series books are great books and good value.Plenty of colour photos though out of each body series and interesting text make this a good book.There are a few faults:too many photos of the same cars therefore lacks a colured variety.Its still a good book though.Its a decent book."
5,Got exactly what I was looking for!,"I bought this album for my husband after he watched home videos of his Russian side of the family set to the Russian folk songs he remembered hearing in his grandparents house while growing up. I searched a long time to find an album that has that quintessential Russian sound - this one definitely does not disappoint. He loves it so much, he bought it for his mother for her birthday...brought tears to her eyes with all the many wonderful memories of her parents who have now passed on."
4,great insights into our American heritage,I am so impressed on the work that was put into making this book an excellent read. I just wished there were more excerpts from the women themselves. The author had more to say thus not allowing full letters etc to be offered.
5,Great book,"This book has alot of personal notes, letters, diary excerpts from the pioneer women. It's an easy and fast read along with some great pictures. It really gave me a feel for what life must have been like. Having family that homesteaded in Iowa in the early 1800s it made me realize what life may have been more like. I really enjoyed this book and am keeping it in my personal library."
4,Love the laxative effect!,"I take this for OCD/trichitillomania. The side effects is that it has made my hair and nails grow, and has made me quite regular, sometimes at the worst times however. Not sure why Amazon has stopped selling it through their own store however, and after further research, I found stronger dosages on other sites such as iHerb.com for very reasonable prices. I will admit, I'm not ripping out my hair again, though the urge to pull is still there, though not as intense."
3,not as good as now foods inositol,"I had to take twice the amount of Jarrow's Inositol to get the same effect as with Now Foods inositol. Jarrow's is alot more light and fluffy, maybe is has less inositol by volume? I'm sticking with now."
1,disappointment,"This book, at first glance was beautiful, but second glance showed that half of the images where out of focus completely.Very unprofessional."
3,I too see focus problems...,"Interesting text, from armchair viewing in the store, but for a big Art Book many of the pictures are disappointing, due to slight blurriness."
1,Thumbs Down,I can't believe I spent almost $1000.00 on this piece of junk. I used it one time and it ceased to function. I did everything the instructions said. No help. I tried to find online help. No luck. Don't waste your money. Avoid it like the plague. I give it a negative 5 stars.
2,Sorry but.....,I bought this like many of the other reviewr since I was sick of Sturbuck. I wasted about a 1/2 lb of arabian from pete's coffee and didn't get one cup that was any better than a drip coffee. I called the customer care and they walked me through but same result. I was hoping I would experience the same as the rest.
2,Great coffee unreliable machin,I bought two identical machines. I have two homes and split my time between them. The first machine survived the one year warranty (six months of my use) and then failed out of warranty. Cost of repair not worth it. The second machine ran for five months and failed - electronic chip replaced under warranty and running well but if it fails I will junk it too.
1,Dead after two years,"We loved it, but it died after about two years. And, of course, warranty expired.Brew group got stuck, there is a link on the web on how to fix it, took about an hour - you have to basically take it apart. But it wouldn't work anyway.."
2,Word of caution,"Expensive product, Saeco Cynthia coffee machine, I purchased this machine in August 2010, very limited use, 1 to 2 cups per day. Machine broke in January 2011, and I had to send it our of State to repair. Te Company paid for all the charges, but 2 1/2 wks without coffee major inconvenience. Machine is made cheep, the stainless steel panels broken off, we had re glue them, don't waist your money!"
2,Good for about 3 months...then the problems begin...support HORRIBLE!,Great for about 3 months.Then the steaming wand began to drip endlessly.I have been trying to contact their support for a week now.My total hold time has been well into the HOURS.And I am on hold now as I write this review.Would I buy this again...NO WAY!Look for another product with better support.
1,Saeco Espresso Machine,"What a dissapointment. I have had the this machine for 5 months. I have sent it back for 1 month for repairs and it is broken again. When it works it makes a nice espresso. Frustrating calling customer service all the time. Would rather have my $$ back and buy something else.Saeco 4038 Vienna Plus 15-Bar-Pump Super-Automatic Espresso Machine, GraphiteSaeco S-TG-ST Talea Giro Super Automatic Espresso Machine"
5,A poetry that forms soothing images,Thomas Sanfilip is the poet for people who tend to close their eyes and imagine themselves drifting away to a peaceful afternoon in some exotic location. A quite similar style exists in Sherod Santos' poetry too but I personally feel that Sanfilip just knows when to use rhyming and when not to vis-a-vis Santos who rarely uses rhyming (not that its absence means any weakness as far as the creativity is concerned). This book is a must buy.
3,Limited...,"These stickers are a little limited in terms of their applicability. A bunch of them are math and reading specific, and some of their images are much lower quality than I would expect. There were lots of stickers in the package, and they were very colorful and encouraging. But I still didn't feel like I got my money's worth, at all."
4,Well-written textbook with clear pictures,"I used this textbook for my undergrad. Actually, like a lump of people, I also bought the books written by Das. I should say that I prefer Whitlow's than Das's. Whitlow gives good explanation about soil mechanics theories and clearly exphasizes those with nice pictures.This book is UK-based! It means that you will gain some more interesting soil mech. information based on English knowledge; for examples, 3-D stress path or liquid limit using cone penetration test.I would have given 5 stars to this book if it had not contained some errors despite the 3rd edition. An example of error is Worked example 5.12!"
4,Good all-rounder,"I bought the 4th Edition(2001)paperback ISBN 0-582-38109-6 A good all-rounder for UK/European biased teaching & practice. I haven't yet tried the accompanying software CD. The content is well laid out, clearly written and well illustrated. Coverage of the subject is well balanced."
5,"Klezmer rocks, baby!","I played this album for someone who was not familiar with Klezmer music, that clarinet-infused mix of emotional Jewish music that is flavored with Eastern European and Mideastern sonorities. He was absolutely captivated. While this is not my favorite of all Klezmer (the Klezmatics) this is pretty darn close. And pretty darned good. If you like Klezmer, this is a must-have."
3,A lot of information,There is so much information you don't have to purchase other books it's all there. I think every Angel's name is there. Has a lot of detail.
2,"Good book, but could have used more editing.","Green Day is a good band, and this biography is okay. However, there are many typos that can't be ignored (Green Day are bringing punk rick to the masses?) and the average person who flips through the book would think that the singer's name is ""Billy Joe"".Most of the information is good, though, and most Green Day fans will enjoy it. The author makes references to his experiences with Green Day, which would've been cooler if it hadn't sounded like he was trying too hard to show how big of a fan he was.The chapter about American Idiot was also poor, because it tried too hard to make Green Day sound like saviors for enlightening the world about the evils of George Bush.It's alright. I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars."

1,Wussie Punk Rock,"They've already ruined the music industry enough through sound, now they have to ruin it by literary material. Here's my perspective of all Green Day products: horrible, worthless, and wasted effort. One reason I hate Green Day the most is because of the way they portray Americans in they're new album, entitled American Idiot. Aren't they Americans themselves? To tell you the truth, I really don't know what their music is about, it's just the fact that Green Day has a horrible singer and an attitude that the band has (trying to act like magical fairy princesses when they aren't) that bothers me. I stand for the classic Rock n' Roll bands, like Dio, Ozzy, Ac/dc, Motley Crue, and so on. Not this pretty boy stuff, for as ugly as this band is! If I wanted to listen to punk rock, I'd listen to the Sex Pistols, not this junk!Either way, this book is a Green Day product and that means that it deserves no credit, it's unfortunate that I can't give it a 0."
2,Dis aight,"Outkast have changed there style over the years this aint as good as there old stuff I wouldnt really call this song rap, outkast are good but they are gettin worsethats all i have to say about that"
2,Hey What?!,"It has been just so amazing what the status of Hip Hop has undergone during the past few years, it seems to have gotten to the point where it starts to become nonsense. That comes with the case of Outkast and their music. The first hit from their double album, Hey Ya, really seems to be a knock off or remake to one of those kinds of songs that actually doesn't seem to focus in from the infectious period of Motown during the 60's and 50's. Although the melody is alright, it is just a little bit difficult to hear what the members are singing, because the audio outwits the actual voice of the group. Still, I think the song could've used a little bit more improvement, and hopefully if the duo does another song like this, it can be heard quite alright."
5,Much Needed!,"Let me tell you about something embarrassing that happened to me last year. I sent an E-mail to an important client who was angry about a misplaced order. The client replied that he understood what happened and wouldn't hold it against us, which was a relief. Then he pointed out every grammatical error and misplaced comma in my message. For example, I had used ""effect"" when I meant ""affect,"" and I had created a run-on sentence by using a comma instead of a semicolon. There were other errors as well. After I picked myself up off the floor, I went onto the Internet, looking for help, and I found a great book called Grammar for Grownups. It gave me clear explanations of all those tricky grammar and punctuation rules. It also gave me practice exercises so I could work on my own to improve. Now I proofread every E-mail I send-and now I know what I am looking for."
1,An Exercise in Vanity,"This is not a book about birth or waterbirth. This is a book about Rima Star. If you find Rima Star and her family to be personally fascinating, by all means spend your money on this book. If you are interested in birth, have a look at something by Henci Goer, Michel Odent, or others who actually write on the subject. If you don't find Rima Star interesting now, you certainly won't after reading her self-congratulatory work of utter narcissism."
2,not a good period piece,It is obviously a made for TV movie with all of the cheesy acting and music you expect. Not what I was hoping for.
2,Enjoyable but average,"This is a reasonably enjoyable and well made romance even if a little formulaic and definitely predictable. I was amazed to read on the dvd that this was written by Louisa M Alcott, but it is explained a bit when I read in here that she was 17 at the time. It is a real young girl's variation on Cinderella and I suspect a bit like the stories Jo March was producing before her Professor advised her to write what she knows, and from the heart.For the first time, I disagreed with the strength of the ratings and comments in here and have bought a dvd I can't see myself watching again, and that is why I decided to comment. I would be more likely to rewatch Ever After and other variations on Cinderella than this one."
3,The Inheritance,This is a wholesome family movie based on a book by Louisa Mae Alcott. It is a classic with good triumphing. It is inspiring.
2,By the numbers pap,"I rented this film because I love Tom Conti, and when he's on screen, I enjoyed it. Otherwise, it's formulaic and stagey: the characters are two-dimensional, the plot development obvious in the extreme. Anyone who's surprised by anything here must never have seen another movie or read a novel.I was particularly offended that we're told in advance of his entrance ""not to be put off by the physical appearance"" of character James Percy, as if here deformed or disfigured in some way. So who walks in but Thomas Gibson, looking like a dark-haired Adonis. This is Hollywood TV at it's shallowest.Another reviewer said the movie is far better than the book. It must be truly ghastly."
4,Great Movie!!!,"This was definately a cute movie....Meredith Baxter is probably not the greatest actress...neither was the man who played her husband in this movie but overall, I really loved it. I've watched it over and over and my roommate has watched it several times as well. It's not a high budget film so you really can't compare it to one but it is a great story and I highly recommend it. There are a couple of scenes that I don't care for but thats about it."
1,The worst American Period Movie Ever,"If Hollywood would like to effect their audience the same way BBC effects its audience, they must pay more attention. Fake accents, constume irregularities and scenery obstruction don't past muster for BBC movies, yet The Inheritance seems to have little direction in this regard. The story line was so predictable, my eight year old guessed what was going to come next. Alcott would be turning in her grave if she saw this bit of codswallop. How this got onto a DVD I'll never know. If you would like a copy of this, just let me know, I'll send you mine for free!"
3,Inheritance,"The packaging and delivery of this item was perfect;however, the movie itself leaves a lot to be desired. It was okay and definitely not on my keep shelf."
4,Very Interesting Story By Loiuisa May Alcott,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase."
5,Very enjoyable,This was a very good movie - enjoyed it very much and the ending was unexpected. Would recommend.
3,Good But Not Great,"This was an enjoyable movie, but not the same quality as a BBC adaptation. It's easy to see this is a made for TV movie. It makes for a fun new flick to watch, but not one I'd rush out to add to my collection. Instead try North and South (Elizabeth Gaskell, NOT Patrick Swayze) or Wives and Daughters - two delightful period pieces VERY well done by BBC."
3,Just OK,"It was just okay. It seemed rushed. Right at the plot starts to develop...boom it's over. It's no North & South, Mansfield Park, or Jayne Erye. The other titles are much better but this movie is nice if you only have 2 hours to watch a movie. It's like a quickie in bonnet films world."
2,Boring,"Totally unoriginal in its plot. Couldn't hold my attention for long, because the ending is so easy to figure out. Even if you are accepting of about all costume romance, this may try your patience."
3,The Inheritance,"I love movies set in the 19th century. This was a good movie, but a little too predictable for its time."
2,Inheritance,Too lovey dovey for me. It was more like a Mills and Boons type romance. The costumes and settings was good but not a classic movie in my opinion.
2,Not the Music CD of the soundtrack,"I only bought this for the additional music CD, as my mum loved the music from the movie, and it was a Mother's Day gift to her. Unfortunately the CD is of some romantic classical music and not of the soundtrack."
5,A good girlie movie!,"Well, I bought this movie from the recommendation of others. As I live in Australia, I can't get it here so rely very much on the excellent ratings of everybody else at Amazon. Well, girls you haven't let me down. I love period movies, and this one didn't disappoint. I fell in love with the whole Hamilton family. The girl who played Edith was so convincing and showed an natural inner beauty that you couldn't help but fall in love with her. I can see why Ida was so jeolous of her. I won't go into the details of the movie as others have already told you the plot, but just to say thanks for your reviews. I have watched it twice now and my sister and I have cried over it, our faces looking so red and the guys just laughed. What is that makes us love such a good story like this?? Not sure, but keep them coming. :-)"
4,Classic Romanticism,"Love it! Beautifully done. Well acted and an overall treat of gorgeous settings, costumes, and dialogue. It sweeps you into the story. Perfect for any girl who believes in the conquest of true love."
5,Something for everyone...,I really like this show. Good triumphs over bad is a theme we don't see enough of today. The costumes are gorgeous and the homes are beautiful. The actors all did fantastic. And there were a few surprises throughout the film. And it was all done in what I see as a realistic way. I also think there was something for everyone in this film. I loved it.
3,Nice movie!,"This is an enjoyable, clean family movie with a nice storyline, though pretty predictable. The acting didn't knock my socks off! Just seemed a bit forced and lacked substance, but the characters were likable. A nice movie to watch on a quiet night with nothing better to do!"
5,Heartwarming and noble,"I really enjoyed this movie so much. It had a good storyline, if a little predictable. I loved watching these great actors. There were noble characters and it was a great escape to the past. Quite a pleasant change from the foul stuff you see on the screen today...such as Mamma Mia, which was quite a disappointment to me. I urge you to buy it and enjoy a pleasant and heart warming story with humor!"
3,Easy watch,This is a feel-good movie. The plot and ending are simple to guess and don't detract me from looking forward from watching this over and over.
1,This DVD must be a copy of an original movie with more exceptional characters.,"I don't have much to say about this movie other than I just watched it to see if it had any good aspects. Sorry, but it just wasn't worth the time."
5,The Inheritance,"Although the story line was somewhat predictable, they did manage to get in a few surprises of conflict which kept me eager to see the next scene.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the actors and their ability to keep the attention of the viewers. I have watched it several times thus far and have already recommended it to others...having loaned it to my friends who also enjoy this genre. This film did not disappoint me, but rather served to create a feeling of satisfaction in me. Simple but lovely drama. I am proud to add it to my period collection!"
3,The Inheritance,"A sweet, well-performed romance. For those who enjoy re-experiencing the first bloom of love. Enjoy!"
4,It is well worth buying this DVD,"I brought this DVD without viewing it. I was a little concern that I would be disappointed with it.Even if a production has good reviews it does not mean that it is any good.BUT I'm glad to report that this production is worth every penny.If you enjoyed Little Women you will also enjoy this production.It is a made for TV so it is a budget film but a really nice movieabout love, loyalty and with a Cinderella ending.This movie is clean,however does has some mild profanity.Which could concern some people looking for family friendly movies.If you are looking for family friendly movieswith no odjectable scenes or language check out:The Railway Children (2000), Pollyanna (2003),An Avonlea Christmas (1998), Road to Avonlea - The Movie (1990),Love Come Softly, Loves Enduring Promise, Loves Long Journey,Loves Abidibg Joy, Sarah Plain and Tall Collection - to name a few.There is a Website that you can go to that gives you a overview of movies[...]"
1,STOP!,"I'm sorry, but this was one of the worst movies we have ever seen. And we went into it predisposed to like it -- Louisa May Alcott, costume drama, etc. -- sounded great! But the lines were horrible; some of the worst ever. We are not the type of people to sit and mock a movie, but by the end we were calling out the lines in advance (and getting them RIGHT!:/) and were just hoping the movie would end and get it over with. If you are looking for a good costume drama to watch -- STOP! Do NOT order this one! Look somewhere else: We ordered ""The Winslow Boy"" about the same time, and it was one of the best I've seen; we all loved it. Try that -- or anything else -- instead!"
1,Couldn't stand it...,"Started with the music, and I couldn't shake the felling the whole time that I was watching a Lifetime movie.Honestly, sice the first 10 minutes you could tell what was going to happen, even without knowing the storyline.Everybody was miscast, characterization is awful, and I just stayed watching it thorugh the end since I made the mistake of buying it (additional to the fact that I have a crush on Thomas Gibson)"
3,No Closed Captions,"On the page of the website it said there is closed captions available on the movie. I got the movie, but there is no subtitle option and there isn't any TV captions showing up on the movie when someone is talking. I was disappointed, it's one of the reason why I got this movie thinking there is captions on it. Thought to let anyone know who is going to buy this that there is no captions on it even when the website said there is."
5,Loved this movie,I really liked this movie even though it was a typical kind of love story. It had a mild swear in it. I would recommend this to others.
4,The Inheritance,"I only gave four stars because the DVD didn't have any special features. But, it is of good quality, and it is my favorite movie, so I am very happy with it."
1,Melodramatic,"The melodramatic plot takes one barely believable twist after another (she rebuffs a wealthy man because she's of a different class, she inherits a fortune, she tries to hide it even though she'll lose the love of her life over it, she is falsely accused of a crime and denies her love over that also, all the rich and handsome young men are attracted to her, she wins the steeplechase even though her horse has never jumped over water before). It's hard to believe the reputable Louisa May Alcott penned this story. And why did they pick a strikingly handsome man to play the part of a man who is several times referred to as unattractive? Overall the movie doesn't ring true. P.S. I don't know why this is in the British cinema category. There's nothing British about it."
1,PREDICTABLE,"The InheritanceIt's made for T.V. and that should give you pause. There is no spark in the romance and it's a predictable and boring story line. I've seen it before in all of Jane Austin's work, only done much better by better actors. Don't bother."
2,Very Lame!!,This was one of those movies that was kinda awkward to watch... Not sure how else to explain it lol.. The acting wasn't very good and parts was very unbelievable....
3,Like a made-for-t.v. movie,"A lovely old-time story-line with good acting. Once you see it, you've seen it. A very simple plot but it turns out well and the ""Cinderella-type"" wins in the end."
1,Highly predictable- no surprises,"I love historial dramas - the Brits have produced so many good ones. Right from the beginning, the transparent plot moved to a predictable end. The acting was lousy as well as the dialog. I had to force myself to watch till the end. I kept hoping for something better. Save your money."
5,great romance that the whole family can watch,"When I bought this movie I had never seen it and I wasn't sure if I would like this movie. I assumed that since it was such a low price it possibly was also low quality. I was very wrong. It is a high quality film and definitely one of my most favorite movies. If you like movies that take place in the 1800's or early 1900's like ""Road to Avonlea"" or ""Anne of Green Gables"" or ""Emma"" with Gwyneth Paltrow you will love this movie. It is a decent movie which is what makes it all the more romantic, not at all like the lustful junk in most movies today. For those who are still wanting a rating(since this movie is not rated) I would give it a definite ""G"" rating.Beautiful movie! I absolutely love it!"
4,the inheratance,the inheratancewell acted good story great period costume all in al verry intertaining never judge anyone as today tomorrow a another page al ways look to the mirror
4,The Inhertiance,Well done adaptation of the story and well filmed and acted by all of the cast members with great locations.
4,Nice Story.,"Nice story, nice acting, nice feel-good story, nice predictable ending.Sometimes, this is just what the doctor ordered. :)"
2,There is SO much better out there... this period piece is awkward and predictable,"I love good period pieces, and this is not one. The acting and staging was very awkward, and some times was just so fake looking. The storyline is too simplistic with one-sided characters. Very reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie...There is a plethora of great period movies out there, North and South, Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Bleak House, Downton Abbey...."
3,A little disappointing,"It really wasn't what I imagined it would be. The characters were portrayed quite differently than they were in the novel. The story line was in parts also dramatically different which resulted in the deletion of some key characters. If you haven't read the book then you probably wouldn't know the difference and might find the story to be quite cute, but if you have read the book you will probably be a kind of disappointed just as I was. I am glad that I didn't pay more than $7 for it."
2,Third-rate Hallmark wanna-be production!,"I bought this after reading all the nice reviews from viewers on Amazon. The Inheritance was a disappointment because it was so cliqued and mawkish. Every plot device was telegraphed and predictable. The actors were capable, the sets and costumes wonderful and the characters noble. But this production seemed like it was aimed for 10-year-old girls. I won't be matching it again that's for sure. Quite a disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"My main problem with this movie was the script. Little was left to be implied by visuals but all had to be said by some character with dialogue that was blunt and uninspiring. Actor performance is hard to characterize with this type of script.I saw little character development throughout the film. Personalities were quickly defined at the beginning and remained fixed throughout. Few characters had any shade of grey on the good/bad scale.On the plus side, the scenery/photography and costumes were nice."
2,"cardboard characters, unsurprising plot","I usually like period romances, but I didn't enjoy this one at all. The main characters - all of them - have entirely 21st century values, so there is little sense of history in it. Also, the only surprise in the plot is kind of a tired ploy that I could see coming a long, long way off."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this based on the great reviews it received... I was very disappointed. I love period piece movies, just not this one."
3,Average movie,"Perhaps the book is better. This could have been an awesome movie with more character development and embellishment on the story. It's clean and decent, though. Good family movie for a ""girls' night!"""
3,Good story but not great acting,"The story was good and interesting, but some of the acting was not up to par. The horse race at the end was laughable."
1,Wretched movie,"I really love period pieces and just about everything Jane Austen-esque. This is NOT one of those. It is like watching a romance novel that was written for 12 year old melodramatic girls. It was boring and predictable with bad acting. On top of that, it somehow manages to be predictable while having a storyline that is tenuously believable at best. Skip this and watch another movie...ANY other movie instead. I wish I could have my two hours back."
2,Not wonderful.,"This movie was very disappointing. The acting was lousy, the story contrived and predictable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone!"
2,Fake & Pretentious,"I watched The Inheritance with anticipation that it was a great period piece. I found it predictable, poorly acted and unrealistic. The actors/actresses, some of whom were good, appear better off acting in different types of films other than this. The cast, was not well suited for the roles. Believable emotion and interactions were weak. There was not enough engagement with viewers, drawing and including us in the storyline about the human experience. It was like a fairytale gone awry.In my humble opinion, this film is in no way a comparison to any classic (or otherwise) period film worthy of being noted. Although harsh, I borrowed this dvd from my local library and, still, it was not worth my time watching it."
4,The Inheritance with Bonus CD,Well done and in good taste movie. There should be many more like this.
3,Okay,"Nice story line, predictable, acting was ok. This movie is clean and if you like horses a nice addition to the library for family movies."
2,Don't Take it Too Seriously,"I loved the book - but the movie definitely lost most of the beautiful simplicity of the story. As most movies will. I do not recommend watching the movie without reading the book first - there were gaping holes in the story that will not make sense without some background. And they took out the brother, which was a disappointment. It is mildly entertaining, totally unrealistic, and has a few lightly comedic parts. (The ""hell"" discussion is a favorite.) But the villain buttons her lips and messes up the beautiful, innocent heroine's life for the sheer fun of it, and whenever the hero looks down his hair falls in his face. So don't expect a classic here."
4,A great romantic drama spiced with humor.,This was a very good family oreinted movie without the present day overtures on sex and violence. I especially liked it because of the lack of profanity that we find in this present day movie experience that we are subjected to. This is a movie that children can watch comfortably.
1,Worst Acting,"I love period pieces. I read them, watch them, dream in them occasionally. This movie was absolutely pathetic. The acting was horrific (and I studied theatre!) to the point of distraction. My husband, who dutifully sits through chick-flicks for my sake, agreed this one was painful. Too much foreshadowing, too much stage-acting, too little feeling, awful soundtrack... Save your money and time."
3,Solid peroid movie & good price but can't compete with Jane Austen,"Amazon recommended this movie to me and it's good -- clean movie, very family-friendly (not like the back of the movie box which makes it sound risque). If you like period movies and happy endings, this is a good choice for you. It doesn't have the nuance and sophistication of Jane Austen movies like Pride & Prejudice which have exceptional dialogue and character development. It's a little simplistic -- here are the bad guys and here are the good guys and there's no gray between and not many surprises. There was one twist which was good. I enjoyed it and loaned it to family to watch; not sure if I'll watch it over and over again as I do my Jane Austen collection, but it's a solid period movie and worth it for the price. Louisa May Alcott is the author (Little Women) of the book it's based on."
3,"Decent to watch, not a favorite","This film is innocent and cheesy. The music is sappy, the acting overdone, the ending predictable. I would recommend The Inheritance to someone who likes period dramas and movies on the women's network channels."
3,Great Story - milktoast interpretation,"I have to admit I was expecting something of the caliber of ""Little Women"" given the story is by the same author. On that level, this is a disappointing made-for-TV offering, with less than convincing dialogue and character development - pity it wasn't produced with a studio budget and production values. That said, if I was 7-14 years old and home from school with time on my hands - it's a good safe family film with a happy ending, so a good one for small kids & wistful young ladies - a few morale lessons included at no extra charge."
1,Why do people like this movie?,"This is such an awful movie, and this is coming from a person who absolutely loves period dramas. The acting is poor, the dialogue is ridiculous, and the plot is horrendously boring. And I thought all of this before I even knew it was a Louisa May Alcott novel, which is even worse. Please, please stay away from this movie. There's a reason it's so cheap."
2,"Very disappointed with its Porridge/Soup function, and feel cheated!","I bought it mainly for its Porridge/Soup function, and its brand Sanyo. After it arrived, I feel cheated. Its Porridge/Soup function is just give you another plastic circle to make it spill-proof, but you can not close the lid. It is totally different with the other brand ZOJIRUSHI.Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer, Premium WhiteI know how to cook porridge using anything without a lid, but I want an automatic porridge cooker. I feel cheated!"
4,Sanyo 10 cup rice cooker,"A good rice cooker. The warm function is as another reviewer said before, warmer than my old National ricer cooker. If you leave it in warm mode overnight, it will create a thin layer of yellowish overcooked rice. My old National does not do this.Aside from this, it is a good cooker. I would think it can last 5 years with daily usage and good maintemaince."
2,"Worked fine for a year, then died.","We had this product for about 1.5 years where we had no real problems with the unit. It cooked adequately without much problems and very uniformly. However, one day we plugged it in and had no power to the unit.There are no instructions for trying to fix the unit by yourself or solve this problem. The manual focuses on problems with food preparation using the unit, but has no instructions for overall power failure, so the only recourse you have is to throw it away and purchase another rice cooker.Compared to my old rice cooker I've had since graduate school (10+ years now), not very reliable."
2,Not as good as I expected,"The cover is not closed very tight. It spills out water when you cook the rice. I exchanged one, it still spills. I don't recommend this brand."
3,Could have been better,"Pros:1) Cooks good rice.2) Easy to clean and water does not leak.3) Unit looks neat. Closed lid allows us to keep rice covered all times.Cons:1) You need to use atleast 3 cups of raw rice minimum. Ofcourse, it has 20 cup capacity and so this is not a major flaw.2) After the rice is cooks, it automatically switches to keep warm function. There is no tick sound or any alarm to indicate this. The first time I used this, I was expecting a tick sound (like most rice cookers). After a while, I could smell something burning and realized that it automatically switches to warm function without any indication. This is a bad design. As a previous reviewer said, most cookers switch to keep warm function. No doubt, but there will be a tick sound to alert the user. This is missing in this cooker.3) Rice gets burnt if you dont unplug the unit on time. Keep warm funciton is not a great option in any rice cooker though."
2,Needed saying,"The ""keep warm"" function is way, way too hot and you cannot turn off the unit. You must unplug it. Bad idea, for the foregetfull, and I don't remember reading about this ""must unplug to turn off"" aspect, in the description text. Works well enough, and cleans up very easily."
4,"A blast - full of blues, soul and personality",Got to start with - I really like the show and it's more like real life premise as opposed to most of the sitcoms out there. This CD is full of great blues songs played by great musicians who obviously love what they're doing. Jim himself also obviously loves this music and his warmth and humor (check out 300 lbs) come right through. Reminds me of a great bar band playing in a sweaty club on Saturday night (and that's a good thing!)
4,Hysterical!!!,I loved this movie! I saw it in Phoenix a few months ago. I have been so anxious for the DVD since then. This movie is hysterically funny and a bit gory at the same time. It has some great comedic acting. One of the best horror comedies I have seen!
2,It's a frayer.,Was not too happy that within weeks it had started to fray on the handle. Would not recommend to buy. Waste of money
3,Heavy on the Evangelism,"The author is heavy on the evangelism and light on the therapy. Most discussion leads back to biblical references, which is fine, but not apt always.There are some interesting ""counseling assistance tools"" in it that could be helpful.If you're looking for a book that more closely ties Psychology, Theology and Spirituality together look for the book by that very title - by Dr. Mark McMinn"
3,A Magical Place,"If you haven't read this before, a fascinating and enlightening read. Of course one wants more details but to capture this much was a gift."
4,a wonderful book.,"This book is wonderful when it comes to telling about different shareware I could load onto my Mac, lots of different tweaks, great humor.Best of all this book helped me regain sanity, by telling me I could reboot, then click and hold my mouse button down to force-eject a CD when no operating system is installed.It's still not David Pogue's OS X: The Missing Manual, but I will give Bob LeVitus credit for helping me out on that one!"
1,"Not a good book at all, save your money","The reviews were obviously written by the writers or their friends. Buy Trading for a Living by Dr. Elder, and High Probability Trading by Marcel Link. These are the best 2 books I've read out of 35 books I've read in 12 years of trading. Good Luck."
1,Useless,"My hobby is to study the markets and I have numerous books about technical analysis and swing trading. This book consists of 362 pages of useless BS. Don't waste your money. I'm going to sell my copy, at pennies on the dollar, to the used book store.Hopefully, if enought dissatisfied customers do the same thing, there will be so many used copies out there that the authors can't get any royalities out of this useless book."
3,A review on secrets,"First of all, this book is for more advanced day traders in my opinion. The author makes references to indicators under the assumption that the reader knows what the writer is talking about. Jea, however, provides some day trading strategies that can prove to be profitable. I gave it three stars because I felt the author had failed to provide adequate details to support his strategies and because the sample charts were too small and almost impossible to read."
1,No secrets here,"Rip off book. Not sure if Jea Yu is still running his daily ""trading service"", but this book is just another attempt to take advantage of traders who are ""newbies"". I would love to see the authors try and trade profitably using the strategies they themselves describe. I always find it interesting when authors show a few charts where their technique/system works flawlessly, yet fail to offer proof that the techiniques have been tested live (with broker statements) using their own money delivering the same positive results."
1,rod,"wron zise not what I wan't .125 OD??? I don't understand very well I was looking for a 1/2"" diametre rod 40"" long is good sorry I hope you can help me"
1,No help to a lawyer,This book is only useful to either a 1L or someone thinking of going to law school. It contains no information that anyone who has spent any time at all practicing law does not already know.
1,sketchy,"A pity that such an original setting -British early Middle Ages-, a plot with good potential and Mr Keegan's great skill should be wasted with such a light heart.Let us skip the ridiculous art cover, there are still so many typos as to disturb even comprehension and the blame of this belongs mostly to Gay Men's Press.Mr Keegan though shares just as much of the blame.In most of the pages we are faced with what looks like a summary of the story: in a third person narrative the POV shifts constantly with each paragraph and quite often even within the paragraph leading to incredible confusion.The same facts are often repeated, often with amendments that contraddict what has already been said half a page above. This leads to many inconsistencies in plot events, characterizations and in minor but disturbing details such as people's looks.Then, suddenly, we are faced with nearly perfect pages that hint at Mr Keegan's undoubted abilities and leave the reader with a bitter aftertaste."
2,Yes....,"I'd buy any Keegan book like a shot - there is no such thing as a BAD Mel Keegan novel- but all I can say is, I hope it was writing another masterpiece that distracted him from his work on this one. Keegan's incredible strength as a writer comes from his power of characterisation: these two lead characters just don't come to life for me. Neither of them have any real past, where as most of Keegan's characters come with a history that makes them move as real people. And there isn't much chemistry between them or even any real friendship, although the historical setting is very well done as usual. Very often Keegan's more complex books pay off with more reading- even over time- but this one is definately on the tepid side. Roll on the next release!"
1,Great book - but THIS EDITION is unacceptable,"The hardcover original of this book is roughly 10"" x 10"" square. This paperback edition takes those pages, keeps the square aspect ratio, and squeezes them onto 9"" x 6"". So the picture, print, etc. are 40% smaller than intended, with wide stripes of white space at top and bottom. Many of the funny details in the pictures are lost, and much of the text is unreadable.The other reviewers are exactly right as to the hilarity of the content. By all means, seek out the hardcover original of this book from a used book seller. A used copy may be imperfect, but it will be less expensive and more readable than this edition."
5,Hilarious (to the right audience),"I must agree with the previous review: This is the best book of its kind, whatever that is (it may be the ONLY book of its kind). If you enjoy music theory or music history, this book will make you laugh harder than Schickele's recordings of PDQ Bach's music. If you aren't fairly knowledgable about classical music (and many of the very dry books which this satirizes), don't buy this book, as much of the humor will be lost on you. If, however, you know that a sonata is not something to be wiped with a handkerchief, this book is full of non-stop laughs."
4,Hilarious,Skewers classical music snobs. Author is a trained musician so knows his stuff and has a great writing style. A light hearted addition to any library.
1,Not your Mama's Corelle Ware,"Now I know I only paid $30 bucks for these but they are supposed to be Corelle Ware. I have been using these everyday or so for about 8 months now and am very disappointed. The first thing I noticed was that your food sweats on the plate. Like the side of the bread of a hot sandwich on the plate gets soggy. Then they don't come clean in the dishwasher like they should. I have to give them a little scrub before loading. But then the unthinkable happened. I was lightly shaking a bottle of sauce over the plate filled with tacos and it slipped from my hand and fell about 3 inches to hit the edge of the plate. THE PLATE SHATTERED. I MEAN SHATTERED. Splinters, shrouds and pieces of plate everywhere. We sat in amazement to the distance it traveled for such a minor, I mean minor accident. It's supposed to be Corelle Ware. The one thing you don't expect to happen. There gone. The wife said she never liked the pattern anyway."
3,"Started off Good, Went Downhill","The book started off interesting enough, but the prose and the unnecessary lesbian romance got irritating. The Catholic Church and priests were portrayed so stereotypically ridiculous that it was funny. I truly wonder how historically accurate the book is.The jumping from narrator to narrator also got confusing sometimes.The book also had an edge of modern left wing propaganda. Which is not surprising being written by a U of Berkeley Professor.A much better historical fiction about a medieval saint is the Barefooted Girl by Catherine Monroe."
1,Mirabelis,"Horrid, boring book. I love Medieval fiction and tried to drag myself through this unintersting mess, hoping to find something worth reading. I didnt."
1,"Really, Truly Bad Writing","I'm sorry but this novel is not much better than most historical romance novels. It's terribly over-written, its plot is wholly contrived, and its charcters lack depth. I suppose she might have the facts right, but it reads more like a lot of pasted together research.Blah!"
1,What a Mess!,"This is a research project posing as a novel. Good luck making your way through the thick morass. Furthermore, it's filled with trite writing, and silly ""twists."" Blah. Avoid this historical sludge."
5,Loved it,"I loved this book from start to finish. The individual characters providing their own first person narratives added to the detail of the story and gave various insights and perceptions of same events. The storyline was alittle weird (to say the least), but somehow believable. It seems to have been based on true events ( or a historical legend) as the author provides some factual details and biographical information at the end. I usually find metaphorical references in books difficult to follow, but despite the fact that this book is filled with them, they were all well placed and easy to understand. Some of the characters' religious ranting was alittle confusing towards the end, but the author did an excellent job of weaving the plot around them and ultimately explaining their meanings through the storyline.If you are a lover of historical fiction, I would definitely add this to your list."
2,I disagree.,"Unfortunately, I disagree with the rave reviews all the other readers have given this book. I don't have any serious problems with the book as a history teacher, but as a reader, I thought the novel lacked development. The characters were contrived and flat, there were too many false starts and loose ends to the narrative, and the gratuitous attempts at sexual titillation were annoying. Seems that the author had no clear vision of what she was trying to accomplish here. There's much better historical fiction out there, so give this one a pass."
2,"Too, too bizarre","Several reviewers have labelled this book ""wierd"", and it is. I'd go so far as to call it bizarre. Not to mention surreal, or perhaps simply unreal. The circumstances surrounding Bonne are unusual enough, without the addition of the way she maintains her status as a wetnurse between jobs (other adult characters drink her milk straight from its source), the people she considers her friends (a dwarf pretending to be a child, a self-flagellator pretending to be her uncle, to name just two.) All of this strangeness is distracting. Medieval history, religion, and fiction have always fascinated me, but there are so many other novels that present the era so much better. Not necessarily nicer, just better. Mirabilis is often repulsive and generally depressing, so if you decide to give it a try, don't do it if you're in a down sort of mood!"
5,The best toothpaste I have used,I have tried many toothpastes and have found that this is the most satisfying. I like it because it makes your mouth feel really clean and fresh. You only have to use an amount the size of a pea to get a good brushing.It seems that liking this product is really a matter of taste. My wife and daughter do not like it. So it really depends on the the taste that you have developed and what you are looking for in your toothpaste.
1,"Not very good, there are better natural toothpastes!","This toothpaste has very little flavor, and what it does have isn't the least bit refreshing. It doesn't leave my mouth feeling clean, either. Jason Natural's Healthy Mouth Tea Tree toothpaste is much better."
4,Trust me... it works!,"I was skeptical when I ordered this item but I'm glad I did. The room use to get cooler the closer you got to the fireplace; the temperature was 5 - 8 degrees cooler than any other room in the house. Now, the room temperature is consistent and barely 2 - 3 degrees cooler than any other room (vaulted ceiling, 15 ft on the high end & 8 ft on the low end, with 2 vents on the lower end near the fireplace).I thought I chose the wrong item because my fireplace is shallow and the dampener is recessed. It took a couple of days to figure out how to make it work in my fireplace. The balloon cannot be position properly when fully inflated. So I positioned it so one of the bulges inflates up into the recessed dampener. Since then, it's worked like a charm! The glass doors are no longer ice cold and I don't feel a draft (even when it's really windy outside) blowing out of the fireplace.I've recommended this product to friends who have draft problems with their fireplace."
2,Didn't work for me,This didn't really work for me. I couldn't completely seal off the flue pipe. A towel worked better for me.
1,Does not fit my fireplace,"The product is too large to fit the diameter of my chimney pipe. Also, even using the shortest rod length possible, it is still too tall for my fireplace. The product is advertised as fitting ""any zero-clearance fireplace"". Based on this and the other similar negative reviews, this is clearly not the case.In hindsight I feel extremely foolish ordering this when a strip of R30 fiberglass insulation provides a better plug for the chimney at a small fraction of the price."
5,The Best Basic Yoga For Seniors,Have used the Renee Taylor's Beginning Yoga for over 25 years. It is easy to follow with very few impossible positions. It helps to alleviate those creaky pains we all experience as we get older plus relieving the everyday stresses.
4,Wonderful,"While the product can be a bit greasy, it really keeps dry hands and fingers from cracking when used regularly. I keep a can in the bathroom and in the kitchen by the sink. Great suppliment to other lotions."
5,Compelling Stories with Masterful B&W Photography,"This book is a must see and read. Stephen Harrison truly captures the personal side of Tibetans in Exile. As you read the stories behind the Tibetans portrayed in the photographs, it's as if you are in the background while Stephen Harrison interviews these most courageous Tibetan people. The portrait photography is wonderfully presented in a landscape format providing for a personal backdrop behind the emotion and suffering of each Tibetan portrayed. This is a one of a kind presentation providing a first-time moving experience each and everytime you open the book."
4,Works fine,"I bought this to rub on dry joints like my knees and elbows. I just like the tea tree smell so thats why I got this. Is it doing the job? yeah I guess, but I probably wouldn't buy it again... Its basically just vaseline."
1,Disappointing,"This was my first Karen Harper book--and probably will be my last. I saw the title and expected danger and excitement--I mean, it even had a former Navy SEAL in it! If there's a SEAL, I expect to see some serious action.Instead, I got a lot of people running back and forth and very little action. But my main complaint is that characters who should have been competent made foolish mistakes or simply didn't behave in a competent manner--the former SEAL (who did not come across as even having been in the military. much less elite military), the sheriff (who ignored some basic investigative techniques), and the villians. If there's a heroine in the story, I want her to be smarter and better than the villian and still escape by the skin of her teeth because he's just as smart and clever--not win simply because the villain was incompetant."
2,Lacking zing...,"When I read a book, I expect/hope to have characters that about whom I really care. While the plot had promise, it felt as though much of it was just thrown in without any intent to actually develop it. Many aspects of the plot and character development felt like an afterthought.While this was, by far, NOT the worst book I have read, I wouldn't waste my time to read it again."
1,This book was so boring..........,"I love Karen Harper. She is a great author and I love her Amish stories. This book, however, was not very ""thrilling"". It had my attention at the beginning but soon started to crash. There were too many characters and it got confusing and it seemed to lull many times. I am looking forward to the next book-hope it is better than this one."
2,Just Ok,The first one of her books I read was Inferno and I was riveted from the first page. This one took forever to get going and then it just dragged. We all knew what the inevitable conclusion was but it took forever to get there.
1,Holy cow pile!,"These vitamins go down okay provided you don't inhale the pungent aroma of a steaming cow pile when you open the bottle. Good thing I'm not pregnant (yet) or I'd pass out and barf every time I opened the bottle. If I'm lucky enough to get knocked up, I'll definitely be switching brands. Another bummer is you have to take 2 capsules instead of just one. I've never had such a smelly bottle of vitamins!"
4,These are the best prenatal vitamins ever,"This a fabulous product. I've used these vitamins for years off and on. The positive effects noted are pretty glowing skin, really long hair and overall positive health benefits. I just love it!"
5,Pleased with the product,"I have been using this product for over 3 years when we started trying to have a baby. Unlike some of the prenatals I've tried before, I stuck with this one because I found it easy to swallow and the ingredients were more than sufficient for my prenatal needs."
1,Hard on the Stomach,"My mother ordered these vitamins after running out of my others for pre-conception. These pills are very large and you need to take two of them which can be hard to remember for a pregnant woman.. or non pregnant woman! It's hard to schedule them in sometimes because I'm usually busy in the afternoon, as I normally just took the one tablet as I woke up. These also have made me vomit on many many occasions, with or without food. It's especially bad with milk. I find that I have to take them right after a meal (and I mean right after or they make me vomit) with a glass of water. If I take them right before food, they make me vomit and if I take them in the middle of a meal they will either induce vomiting or dry heaving.The last pills I took at the same amount of vitamins in a much smaller capsule, were much cheaper and only had to take one a day. I would advise looking to other options before settling on this one. They're more trouble than they're worth."
1,Far too much vitamin A,"Watch out! Most of these over-the-counter vitamins put in way too much vitamin a, which is known to cause birth defects."
5,"Great, thorough study!",I have really enjoyed this study of the doctrines of grace. My children are grasping the truths of Scripture. The side stories bring understanding of each doctrine. Thank you!
3,cute strappy sandal but too tight,"i was so excited to get these shoes because they i love the look of the patent leather and the cork sole combination. however, these fit very tight and i have a normal medium width foot. the footbed is too narrow so the sides of your feet kind of spill over the side...not very pretty."
4,A quality tool for the price,"I use this amp clamp primarily for testing charging systems and parasitic drain on 12vDC automotive applications which it does well, although it only measures to one decimal place it is a quality product that I would recommend."
5,Easy to use,A nice simple device to use. I like the auto-zeroing function for DC current measurements
2,Ok But Spend A Little More Money,"Can not trust the reading on dc amps. Meaning not sure if you are getting a good reading on low amps. Not made for milliamp readings. Works ok on anything over 1 amp dc., but just ok. Knobs and buttons are to close together and easily change by accident. I was afried of this but did not want to spend the money. Like the old saying, ""you get what you spend."""
5,Good for all ages,"This inspiring and fun-to-read book profiles 23 Ohioans who have exhibited outstanding character and courage. Some are quite famous, others not at all. Among the famous are the Wright Brothers, Tecumseh, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Toni Morrison, and Jesse Owens. Among the not-so-famous, but should be, are Jacob Parrott, Mary Ann Bickerdyke and Janarius MacGahan.I put this book at the top of my Christmas giving list for these reasons: 1. All the stories make you appreciate the sacrifices and character of the individuals profiled (""Could I ever be that brave?""). 2. All the stories are well-researched. I thought I knew about all there was interesting to know about some of these Ohioans, but the book taught me otherwise. 3. It's written in story-telling fashion, making for a good read-aloud book for the family and an interesting read for the junior and senior high school set. 4. It well represents the diverse interests and ethnic backgrounds of Ohioans."
4,Hidden Track,"Has anyone else noticed the HIdden Track you get when you stick this CD in a computer with windows media could someone find and email me its name all it has on the name is ""Hidden Untitled Track"""
3,Pretty Good Disc,"I was some what pleased with this CD. When I'm gone is what attracted me to purchase it, and now there are a handfull of songs that I like of off this. CD has some heavy moments and some soft moments, which makes a good solid Disc. Overall is was good, nothing great, but good.My top 5:Away from the SunWhen I'm goneHere without youRunning out of daysTicket to heaven"
4,good album from pushing 40,"I enjoyed Loser and Kryptonite but never bought the Better Life for whatever reason. Flash in the pan? Weak overall album?Just too old? After hearing ""When I'm Gone"" on top of the singles from the first album I thought I'd give these fellow Southerners a try. I'm glad I did. Strong straight ahead 90'sversion of rock. In addition to being Southern. These guys are a bit of a throw back to the 70's rock bands like Blackfoot.I'm way out of this demographic being a 37 year old father of two. But I love R-N-R and its refreshing to hear youngsters creating this type of rock for fans of rock."
5,Great CD -- Worth the Wait!!,"I was impatient waiting for 3 Doors Down's second CD for over 2 & 1/2 years, but this disc was definitely worth the wait. My favorite songs are ""Here Without You"" and ""Away from the Sun"", but I like all of the songs. I would highly recommend this disc to 3 Doors Down fans and fans of similar bands (Creed, Nickelback, etc.) and just rock fans in general."
4,Pretty Cool I Must Say,"What can you say about this CD after 3 Doors Down had such a great release for their first CD? First of all, there is much less guitar strung rhythms. Personally that was my favorite about 3 Doors Down, but now there is less of it. The only real hard gutar piece is in ""When I'm Gone"" and other then that there isn't one.Yah last....if you listen to it on your computer there's an UNTITLED HIDDEN TRACK after the last song. This is a long, great song. I think it was a cool idea to place a hidden track on this."
2,Depressing and Boring!,"I was in the post grunge phase at the time and I liked The Better Life. The Better Life has not aged very well over the years, but still a decent album. Away from the Sun is an appropriate title cause it is that depressing. Hell you may think Suicide! Hopefully you have not slept in days so this album can do its true job, put you to sleep. Most of the songs are listenable, but that doesn't make for originality or actual talent. Brad Arnold is a more boring version of Rob Thomas vocally and lyrically. If I had the opportunity to sell the Better Life for 5 or more bucks, I wouldn't hesitate. As for Away from the Sun, I gave that album away to a friend who doesn't know the difference between real, original music and crappy, depressing and boring music. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!"
5,"3Doors Down Cd- greatest cd, EVER","When i picked up this cd, the only reason I really wanted it was because it had ""When I'm Gone"" and ""Here without you"", songs i know. But isnt that why everyone really buys a cd? becuase of the songs they know? Anyways, I put the cd in my cd player, started on my homework and just let it play..and I came to this conclusion, 3 Doors Down is the greatest band and has made best cd ever. My favorite songs on the cd are, ""Away from the Sun"", ""Here without you"", and ""I feel you."" This whole cd has something for everyone, it's not a hard rock cd, but still rock. After i bought this cd,i bought their first cd, since everyone I've talk to said it was their best one. No matter what is said, this still is number 1 to me. Their first cd was a little bit more of a heavier rock,but still good. OVERALL: greatest cd ever! HIGHLY recommended."
4,American Pride,"Away From the Sun gives hope to the fact that there is still some quality music being produced that isn't prepackaged crapola. 3 Doors Down turns out a very heartfelt album here steeped in their trademark guitar riffs, bending harmonies and somber thoughtful lyrics that make you want to sing along !! 3DD definitely avoids the sophomoric jinx with tunes like ""Here Without You"", ""Running Out of Days"", ""Away from the Sun"" and of course the tune that has become an anthem for our troops overseas ""When I'm Gone"" !! I haven't been this jazzed about a ""southern"" rock band since Drivin' & Cryin'...and these guys have the same energy, their own distinctive sound and tremendous musicianship!! These guys belt out high quality rock that carries a distinctive sound that you can be proud to have in your collection."
5,Awesome Sound and Pure Talent!,"This CD is AWESOME! Pure talent - through and through! Their music ranges from pop rock to hard rock to borderline grunge. These guys are a throwback to the days when a group HAD to write and perform QUALITY music in order to be successful and popular as opposed to the marketing-mania sweeping the music industry today. If 3 Doors Down continues to crank out quality music like they have on their first two CDs they'll be headed toward Bon Jovi stardom/success. Heartfelt lyrics, bone-tingling riffs and quality composition is how you'd describe their music. Buy this CD as well as their first one, The Better Life!"
4,A Mild Sophomore Album,"I'll be honest I expected a little more out of 3 Doors Down with their second album than what ""Away From The Sun"" offered. The only three songs that really stand out are the singles that were released, ""Away From The Sun"", ""Here Without You"", and ""When I'm Gone."" There are other decent songs such as ""Sarah Yellin'"", ""Road I'm On"", and ""Ticket To Heaven"" but this album does not do the band justice.I would recommend ""The Better Life"" over ""Away From the Sun"" any day. The band recycled riffs on the new album and overused the chorus effect/arpeggiated chord combination. They could have tried a little harder. You may like the album if you're into bands such as Vertical Horizon and Third Eye Blind, just with a harder bite to them. Worth a listen but don't expect too much."
2,meh,"this is good for alt rock, but bad for music. their debut was decent, i didnt buy it, but i kept most of the songs on my comp for a while, and still have 3 of them. that said, this is dissappointing. they do nothing new, but there is no ""kryptonite"" on here. nothing interesting, no sparks. ""here without you"" is the best song, its slow but has some power to it, not much, but enough for it to be a decent occassional listen. the rest is mediocre at best. the only other song i kept on my comp is ""away from the sun."""
2,Full-on weak!,"If you liked ""The Better Life,"" don't ruin your enjoyment of 3 Doors Down by buying this one. It's much less rock-oriented - mostly just pop ballads, and as another reviewer put it ""somewhat boring."" The writing isn't as good, nor is the arrangement (they seem to have gone with a studio drummer this time). Several of the tracks reminded me of the more depressing stuff on Seven Mary Three's ""American Standard.""There are a couple of tracks that are catchy, but none as good as some of those on ""The Better Life."" I get the impression that the record company asked them to water down the album - either that, or they ran out of creative steam.2 stars (maybe 2.5) because of the disappointment factor. Perhaps the album would get a 3 if ""The Better Life"" hadn't been so good."
3,3 Doors Down are capable of more,I really just bought this album for 2 tracks.1.Away from the sun - my favorite song.2.here without you.The rest of the tracks are pretty much just noise orfillers as i call them.
2,3 Doors Down got WEAK!!!,"I loved 3 Door's ""A Better Life"" album, so when this album came out I rushed to get it. After listening to it, I was VERY disappointed. Gone is the energy from the first album. Every song is so WEAK and BORING! If you liked the powerful tunes and catchy riffs of the first album, you will find yourself sadly out of luck here. The only cool thing about it is that it includes a bonus DVD which has a couple of videos from their first album. 3 Doors Down has gone from mainstream coolness to the wayside of mediocrity."
2,Major Disappointment,"I was disappointed with this CD, after A Better Life I expected so much more from this band. If you like your music mellow then this is the CD for you. I could barley get through the first 5 tracks without falling asleep."
2,a new annoying sound,there first cd was so much better. there isnt a duck and run on this cd. and i am bout tired of the song here without you. but the plus is that when im gone is a hot song. but they get so much unwanted radio time that i wished they didnt have. i could call them sellouts. they dont have the good sound that they used to.
2,The beginning of a slump in both sound and a rejection of their old fans,"When I first heard 3 doors down 'the better life' I thought it was an amazing cd and still do to this day. When I heard a new album was coming I was so excited but when I got it and played it my heart sank. This ladies and gentlemen is a sellout cd, gone is their old heavier sound and lyrics and thus they made this cd more mainstream with tracks like 'here without you.' This cd would be good to listen to if you were VERY VERY VERY depressed. Its really hard to listen to this cd all the way through without wanting to turn it off. Still theres a few good tracks on here like 'When Im Gone' Going down in flames, Sarah Yellin and changes. I think if your around 16 years old or younger and are going through that omg Im so lost wtf someone help me then youll like this otherwise stay clear, better yet pick up the better life and listen to 3dd at their best and heaviest."
4,Another Great One!,"This CD is awesome. It always takes me a couple of times to listen to a CD before I can completely decide if I like it or not, but not with this one. I loved their last album so I'm obviously a little biased, but Away From the Sun is an awesome CD. It's done in the same style as their last one, but that's not meant to be a slight to the band because their last CD had to have sold millions! If you're a fan of 3 Doors, this CD will not disappoint."
5,WOW,"as a 3dd fan, i was gonna be a bit biased goin into this albums release but i think this albums gonna wash away the kryptonite image of 3dd this albums full of jamming and a bit smoother and maybe even a bit funkier sound it is a great album and i highly recommend it to any fan of rocknroll"
4,Great CD - Several huge hits,"This CD came to me by accident, and I listened to it from start to finish. It has many good songs, especially its two biggest hits ""Here Without You"" and ""When I'm Gone."" I highly recommend it, because it is a summary of basically where rock music is right now. Check it out!"
1,majorly disappointed,"As a fan of 3 Doors Down, I have their other cd (The Better Life) and think it is a great album all around. However, after waiting a looong time for their follow-up, I was dissapointed. The album is written for radio, trading the darker feel of songs like ""down poison"" for much more radio-worthy ballads like the single ""when I'm gone"". Although a few songs were middle-of-the-road.. overall this cd was a major disappointment, and I am amazed at the high ratings it got from many people."
4,Entertaining...,"People buy and listen to rock albums for various reasons; lyrics, melody, what have you.Admittedly, Away From The Sun falls a little short of the quality of The Better Life. Looking at previous reviews, I suppose everyone is entitled to their own opinion. These two albums are ones I could play back to back and be more than satisfied with the contents of each album. I look forward to their third endeavor. I am sure the third album will hold as much meaning as the previous two.So, if you enjoy a solid sound with plenty of underlying meaning? Pick up this album and its predecessor, you won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome!,"3 Doors Down is one of the best groups out today. Their second CD, although quite different from the first, is excellent as expected. There was not a single song that I did not like."
1,What happened?!,"I remember when I first heard ""Kyrptonite"" on the radio and how eager I was to get the debut release from a no name group called 3 Doors Down. Since then I have eagerly awaited their sophmore release and now ""Away From The Sun"" is finally here. What the hell happened?! The great origional sound that I heard the first time around just got up and left. After hearing the entire album I am sad to say I am extremly dissapointed. The songs are all bland and tastless, in fact it's nothing but mainstreem rock or as I prefer to call it... ! I would advise a true fan of this group to count your blessings and listen to ""The Better Life"", which is infact the better record. I gave this album one star because ""Away From The Sun"" only has one decent track ""When I'm Gone"". Unless 3 Doors Down goes back to the way they were, I am gone!"
2,predictable,"OK, at first I was like ""this is awesome"" but I heard how all the songs blend together like one hour long one. There are some good songs like ""When I'm Gone"" and ""Here Without You"". But other than that, there isn't much worth while on this CD. Sorry guys."
3,Stop Spoiling Everyone's Fun,"Firstly, this CD is alright, not great. 2 really good songs, Here Without You and When I'm Gone. But I just have one thing to say: could those people who pretend to be such music connuiseurs by saying CD's like this are terrible (you know who you are) please stop paying out perfectly good bands. If you don't think they have talent or are unoriginal, don't listen to them then. Bands like 3 Doors Down and Nickelback are both obviously doing something right, that's why so many people buy their CD's. If you don't like it, don't put other people off. Thank god you can actually listen to songs on Amazon instead of having to rely on some dodgy reviews (no offence to people who actually like the album they're reviewing).So if you just don't like the CD, say so. Don't say it's below you to like this kind of ""uninspired, untalented"" music. Everyone has different tastes."
5,Unbelievable Album,This is by far one of the best rock albums to come out in a long time. Away from the Sun is by far my favorite song on the album. I saw them recently in concert and that will make you loves these guys even more.
5,Away From The Sun,"I bought this album for the song ""When I'm Gone"" and I love it. I enjoy both of the albums, The Better Life, and Away From The Sun, and I am not sure which one I like better, but the more I listen to this one, the more I like it. MY VERY favorite tracks are 1,3,6,9,10."
3,I'm Pretty Apathetic About This : (,"Nothing against the band or the fans who love this band... But I found the album to be a bit ""country"" for my tastes. Don't buy this CD expecting 'Linkin Park' or 'Red' because it's not anything like that... Maybe a bit more 'Rascal Flats' meets 'Nickelback.'Decent quality and good lyrics! Just not my 'thing.' : )God bless!"
4,Listen to Fozzy before you buy....you may want both!,More variety than the hits package....a stronger CD overall. Package this with the Fozzy cd that Duane mentions and you've got a great summer ahead of you.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)
5,Awesome Album,"This is one of the greatest albums ever. Every song on the album is great. 3 Doors Down is hands down one of the best band out today, i highly recommend this album to anyone"
5,Awesome!,"Well I bought their first CD and I believe this already out does the first. I am so impressed with this CD, you have got to buy it!!!"
3,Fairly Appealing,"The cd ""Away from the sun"" really isnt that bad after a listen through it. It almost like Goo-goo dolls meets Nickleback. The cd delivers not much of anything new, but decent songs that you can't get enough of. The worst song would be the ending track which needed not be on the album.It is a fairly respectable cd that deserves some attention. Though the vocals tend to get scratchy and in some songs the lead singer sounds like he is spitting as he sings, the album is a nice revival to a scene right now drowned in Simple Plan and Blink 182. A cd job well doneGRADE: B+"
3,Good album -- but not great...,"This was a good album -- I bought it for Here Without You and When I'm Gone. I happen to be a big fan of this band's acoustic sound -- particularly Here Without You. They're much better that way. The songs are considerably jumbled and poorly mixed with only a few exceptions. Use your best judgment. If you're heard them before and you like them, get it. Don't buy it for just a couple of songs."
5,Recommended!!! all the way,"I loved it i loved away from the sun, it just takes your hear away, the music.....amazing, I would recommend it to trapt fans"
