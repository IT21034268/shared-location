3,Decent for the price,"Nice cheap price, but when bending over or sitting, the tape measure tends to fall out a lot, especially a Fastcap tape. After a few weeks of regular work abuse, the pencil sharpener started falling out and eventually the belt clip broke on one side. But still useful and cheaper than buying new pants or belts because your tape ruined the pockets or your belt."
2,Flimsy,"Broke within a week, they must have changed the plastic as I had had these in that past and they lasted for months, this one just cracked for no reason. It's a shame because its a great idea, better than the magnetic options, just poorly made. I'm going to try to fix it with epoxy."
4,The Big Dig,"I bought this book, along with The Big Dig at Night, for my husband, a Boston native. He loved both the books, but would really have wanted, in addition, more detailed maps in the changes that have been made."
1,A disappointment,"I was excited to recieve this book as a holiday gift, but after taking the time to go through it I find I am very disappointed by the generic quality of the photographs. I thought I'd be seeing something new, but it doesn't show me anything I couldn't see myself. Too bad the project is now basically finished and these tired images will be part of the permanent record of the true engineering miracle of the Big Dig. The project and the people who made it deserve better."
1,All in Skivvies!,What is truly remarkable about this book is that the photographer completed his work wearing nothing but boxer shorts!
4,Not a bad game,"This was my first fishing game purchase so I didn't know too much about what the game would be like, other than a few reviews. The game has a few issues, like every game. The graphics are pretty good, as good as their probably going to get. I've only played it on the beginner setting so it's very easy to land a fish, just look for them in the water and cast. One negative thing about the game is that if you don't reel in a fish quickly it might take up to 20 minutes just to reel in one fish. Just be prepared whatever comes your way. Not a bad game in my book."
5,best bass fishing game ever.,"I haven't played a bass fishing game this awesome ever. It tells you the weight of the bass. It also allows you to fish at different places in the world too. Mostly in the USA also one in Mexico too. There are near 20 pound bass in Mexico on this game. This is for bass fishing only. I would highly praise this game for small kids, and adults too."
3,Trophy Bass 2007 for PC,"Well, I bought this game hoping that the graphics would be better than the screen shots I saw online... and overall they're not really too bad, except for the surface of the water. It looks like you're fishing on a broken mirror. The lakes are not realistic at all, BUT this fish are good looking, like to jump A LOT, and you can drive a boat around the lakes... all positives!A fun game for the computer, if you have some time, because the bigger fish take a LONG time to reel in. Reely! As it's been discontinued, get it before it's gone!"
1,Don't waste your money,"What a waste of time and effort and money. Poor, or should I say NO customer service or support...leave a message and hold your breath, I left 2 already with NO response.Poorly written, you can do better with a simple power point presentation. Misleading in the fact that sure you can put pictures and documents on a cd but you could do that without this poor excuse of a program. Does nothing with any other ancestral software other than copy the pictures. WOWI am going to ask for my money back!"
5,This is a wonderful product!,"This product is great - it's an easy way to archive and share your photos, audio, video and documents. You can create slide shows with your photos, add music, and share everything with your family and friends in a way that is easy for anyone to use. I've always had good luck with tech support and customer service. I definitely recommend this product."
3,Doesn't travel well,"This is a hard to get old classic scent: I wanted it as a gift for a friend. The bottle leaked into the carton only a little but enough to overwhelm me when I opened the package. ? if the real thing as there is no Halston logo on the bottle and it was not sealed, but the box appeared to be genuine. Only my friend will be able to tell as she is familiar with the scent and I am not."
5,Old tme favorite!,I used to wear Halston for years in the '80's. I'm glad I've found it again; and at a great price! Brings back fond memories.
5,Halston,I am a Halston girl and have been using this cologne for years....love it!!!!!!I get so many compliments on this scent.
1,They keep delaying the shipping,"I really wanted this for a gift, and I ordered 2 times a month apart, both times they didn't have the stock and couldn't make the shipping on time. I end up buying another brand."
4,Thicker than expected,"Good line, high visibility, Thicker than expected wich translates to shorter casts from the surf.Next time will buy thinner for better casting distance. Nice line though."
5,A CD CAN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!,"I WAS TOTALLY DELIGHTED WITH THIS CD. I QUIT LISTENING TO COUNTRY MUSIC ON THE RADIO QUITE A WHILE BACK BECAUSE I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE NEW COUNTRY ARTISTS TODAY ALL SOUND ALIKE. I ACCIDENTALLY FOUND A COUNTRY STATION THAT PLAYS ONLY ""OLD"" COUNTRY MUSIC AND AARON TIPPIN WAS THE FEATURED ARTIST FOR THE DAY. WHEN HE SINGS ""THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I HOLD YOU"" -- EVEN THOUGH I DON'T SMOKE -- I NEED A CIGARETTE! THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD. I BOUGHT THE CD JUST FOR THAT SONG. I WAS THRILLED WITH THE REST AND SOON BECAME QUITE ENTHRALLED WITH HIS ""THAT'S AS CLOSE AS I'LL GET TO LOVING YOU"". THERE IS NOTHING ANYONE CAN CRITICIZE ABOUT THIS CD OR THIS MAN. WHAT A MAN! WHAT A SINGER!"
5,the best,"this is the best mattress pad i have gotten.it fits well , feal's well and i would buy it again. thank you."
4,Very pleased with Croscill 400 mattress pad,"I was somewhat skeptical in ordering a mattress pad without seeing it before purchase. However, the quality of this mattress pad is everything I wanted and even more. It stays in place on the bed and it washes nicely."
1,Cheap product!,This mattress cover is not worth buying. It is rough and is put together really cheaply. I received it torn and put it right back in the box...it's going back.
2,Sticky,"I was really disappointed with this lubricant. It becomes sticky very quickly. I love Dr. Sadie's books, but this is not up to par."
3,Not bad,"If you like Free, you'll want this one for your collection. However, their earlier albums are better for sure."
2,Heartbroken more like it...,"A patched up Free attempts to carry on as normal, but the chemistry is just not there - Fraser is gone and Tetsu struggles / doesn't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him. Rather than contribute some great bass ideas, he is content just to plod along; Kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks. Gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing. He's running on remote control. It sounds like he's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head; Bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others. His work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band's contractual requirements. The whole album is Lazarus with a triple bypass.The only standout track is the EXCELLENT 'Wishing Well'... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song... another album to buy if you can't stand blank spaces in your Free CD collection... What a tragic waste..."
4,"""Some Say Love Is, Some Say What Is Love........","This effort just keeps getting better, with every listen. I've owned this on both the original vinyl, and CD. I had the pleasure of seeing Bad Company last night, and as usual, have walked away with a better appreciation of both Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke, as true survivors, men who play and perform with conviction, and do what true musicians are supposed to do - make life easier to understand and tolerate through their music......I Want To Tell You My Story""** Isn't this what it's all about, after all?"
3,"Good songs , but overly polished production","I love some of these sons alot ""wishing well"" ,""Muddy Water"", and Heart breaker"" It deffinitly was a swan song for the band, and the end of a era , as well as a beginning (meaning birth of Bad Company)of another.However it was too polished of a sound. and it reminds me of Todd Rundgren's Something Anything a bit. This may be a good sound for T.R., but not for a raw talent like Free. It also really does not sound like a true free with Frasier out of the band, And kossoff declining, it was best that the band called it quits after this release."
5,Awsome rock creativity,This the best work Free has ever done! As good as ant Led Zepp CD.A masterpiece where every song seems like part of one grand composition.Paul Rodgers voice never better. one of my all time favorites.
1,ruined trip,"This book looked like a great review. However, his suggestion was that if you had a fast pass you could do the rides at anytime you wanted. So, we stayed at one of the universal hotels (and got nine room keys for one room) and did a casual trip around the park. The passes worked great. UNTIL we got to the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket which the kids were looking forward to. 2 hour wait. The fast pass does not (and never has) worked at this ride.Thus, this book ruined our vacation."
5,Great Book---Thanks Kelly!,"I am going to Universal this summer, I haven't been since 2000 and I was so happy to buy this book. I received it about a month ago, read it cover to cover and now I'm rereading it and even highlighting a lot of very useful info he gave!!! He gave very good advice on the best seats for all the shows and even on most of the rides. He also described the rides...without giving anything away! Lastily, I loved his reviews on the restaurants. Great book! Buy it, you won't be sorry!"
2,Doesn't work without special software,"There is no sign of damage or anything abnormal. But it doesn't charge my phone, I guess I need special software. This is bad because battery charging is a simple technology."
5,Another visit to Deep Valley,"As a longtime fan of Betsy-Tacy, I'm so glad to see ""Emily"" and ""Carney"" returning to print! I first read this several years after the other Deep Valley books, and enjoyed it just as much. It's interesting to see life outside of ""the Crowd"", and though I did miss some of the familiar faces, Emily is a delightful new acquaintance, and Cab makes a very welcome reappearance."
2,Type is Way Too Small,I should have realized that you can't shove several books into one without this happening. The low rating has nothing to do with Wodehouse - I am an inveterate fan - but I wish Amazon gave us a choice of getting him in type big enough to read.
5,"Hilariously funny, truly PGW is the master of farce",PG Wodehouse excells in this novel while leaving one in gaffaws and amazed at Bertie's uncanny ability to get into such messes. Jeeves as always reliable and commanding. PGW is probably one of the funniest and finest writers of this century.
3,not stable enough,"My transfirmer is much sturdier and I highly recommend it over this. It is not very stable. I know the stepper gives way, which is fine, since it is much larger and lower... but the top of this is small and high and it just doesn't feel secure. Make sure you put your foot directly in the center of it or else it will tilt on you! The grip is good, when my sweat falls on it, it doesn't make my shoes slippery, as it would sometimes get on the transfirmer. I think the best design anyone could have would be the transfirmer with this grip surface. I hope someone will make it soon."
3,A bit un-sturdy,"I weigh less than 200 pounds and the 1st day I used it, I almost fell on my butt doing single leg calf raises. What basically happened was, I was standing on the very edge, when all of a sudden the top riser flipped upwards, sending me flying off of it. You have to make sure to put your weigh in the middle of the step. I now have to be very careful when doing calf raises on it.Otherwise it is ok - compact, light and convenient."
2,12 is not 14,"I needed a step system that had a height of 14 inches. The High-Step Club seemed to fit the bill. According to the Amazon.com ad (The High-Step Club), this step system provided adjustable heights from 4 to 14 inches. However when the High-Step Club arrived, it was only 12 inches high, 2 inches less than promised and 2 inches less than I need. If additional risers are required to get the full 14 inches, the ad should have said so."
3,Step Aside,Would be great if the picture was not misleading. If you think you are getting a full size step you are wrong this step is 1/2 the size of a regular step. I am returning this one and ordering (The Step Original Health Club Step Aerobic Trainer) which is the actual size. here is the link:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OWSXQ/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_4?ie=UTF8&psc;=1&smid;=ATVPDKIKX0DER
5,Works well,I've been wanting one of these for a couple of years. I work out daily with Cathe Friedrich. Her lastes DVD set requires 5 risers. Buying the high step accomplished both needs.
5,Gym Quality Product,"Good quality. Arrived timely. Would purchase again. This product is also used in my personal trainer's gym. It can be used for various exercises like push ups, step ups, jumping, etc."
3,Be Sure to Check the Dimensions--,"Be Sure to Check the Dimensions. I purchased this item a little too quickly without checking the dimensions so I was very surprised that it came so small. It is basically a 15x15 cube, not a long step bench that you would usually see/use. It is even to narrow to do incline pushups on....I guess you could use it for high powered jumps, but it's function is limited due to its size. I am returning this one today and will purchase a larger one that meets more needs."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"I was looking for a platform to step on, kind of like the ones people use for crossfit. I thought this step would do the trick but it didn't work out for me. I am sure it works perfectly for people who just want to do step aerobics, but that is not what I was looking for."
1,For Balance...,"... gotta give it a one-star, for the simple fact that it says 14 inches and is only 12. Get it right, or don't say anything.J"
1,Dangerous toy for hamsters and gerbils! NOT ADVISED!,"This and other brand similar plastic logs are dangerous.Our gerbil got his head (past his ears) caught in one of the small holes today (terrifying until we got him out).We almost had a major disaster. When I alerted people I know, one man told us his hamster also had gotten caught in one of these logs a while ago.They are good for mice and fish- that's about it. Too dangerous for gerbils and hamsters."
4,The injustice and barbarism of the Third Reich.,"I saw this two hour version of the book. It is a nice accompanyment to Shirer's book. The book is probably the premier book on the Third Reich but the film makes the same points in a nice easy summary. As the narrator says ""This is all that is left of the Hitler and the Third Reich-photo images""I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the entire six hour replay of the original would be the best. However the two hour summary reviews all the main points on this criminal regime.This is an interesting although disturbing film. It should be shown in history classes."
5,Practical with a real classy look,"Very comfortable to swim in and the low scoop back is sexy. It also has a lot of tummy control. Really flatters figure for those of us who don't have abs of steel, just yet:)"
1,Um....,"A novelization of a movie that was based on a book? Does anyone else find this to be an incomprehensible waste of trees? You'd do better to read the original - it's by Patricia Highsmith -, and here's hoping that the author makes no money out of this bizarre endeavor."
4,Romance,A beautiful book of deceptively simple poems. It's often as close to taking a photo as words can get.
4,Muy bueno,"Es un buen accesorio, no tiene problemas, mejor que oir radio en el movil, además incluye un juego nuevo de audífonos."
3,Apple iPod Radio Remote Works Well But Not Everywhere,"Very easy to use; small and convenient. However, doesn't always get reception at every place. Price, I think, is somewhat overpriced. Thanks."
4,Live! Through the iPod!,"This is a cool little addition for those who like to stay plugged in. It works pretty well and is easy to use. After I purchased it and used it a little I realized that, although I enjoy several live radio shows, I'd rather not spend even more time with things in my ears. Now it is just another gadget in the drawer. (I DO like my iPod a lot.)"
3,work buts great,It does exactly like it says it will but it is very pricey for what it does. One earbud did not work and it had to be returned.
3,"Very nice, but compatible only with Nano and Video iPods...","Although the plug fits to my iPod Photo, the radio does not work.Yes, it is written on the site that it's only compatible with Nano and Video iPods, but it's hard to find this critical information."
3,Functional but not graceful,"I got this for my ipod so that I could have a radio on there and I honestly don't use it much anymore.The remote works fine and the FM radio is okay (although it doesn't get the strongest reception in a building). My biggest problem with it was the headphones. They pretty much suck. So I end up having to put my own good headphones on there which are standard length and then I have what feels like 6 ft of wire wrapped around my body and I constantly get it caught on things.So, oddly enough I stopped using it because it was just to time consuming to get it all wrapped around my person and take it off.All in all it does the job but not with a lot of grace."
4,"Works well, no AM though...","I got this as a present. Honestly, I had been considering buying a Zune because the iPod didn't come with a radio function. However, my wife bought me an iPod for Christmas. So, I began looking around for a radio function and found this. The only problem is that it was about $50! So, after paying $200-$300 for an iPod, Apple gets you for another $50.As the product goes, it works well. I use it primarily at the gym to tune into the televisions or local radio stations. I have to admit though, I was disappointed that there was no AM function. I know many people disregard AM, but sometimes its the only way to get the college football, basketball, etc. game. So, I was a little irritated when I was listening to a game in my car, go into the gym and realize that this $50 add-on only supported FM.Overall, this will work quite well for most people. It comes with a set of headphones that have a shorter cord since the remote/FM receiver has quite a bit of cord already."
2,Rip- Off by MacIntosh?,"This product seems like both a literal AND a figurative afterthought..... or is it intentional on Mac's part to make more money by charging for an overly priced ""accessory???"" An FM radio should be standard with any of the expensive Ipods, not an accesory that get's worse reception than any portable radio I own. It also seems cheaply made. Typical ""Ipod"" philosophy of looking good is better than working good."""
3,**** Nice little toy,"I ordered before release in January, still no sign of these anywhere. Apple shortage at fault. Amazon updated ship date to April on my order. As of 2-23-06 Atlanta Lenox Apple store has no clue when these will come in.Update 3-7-06I gave up and ordered from Ebay a week ago. Received it yesterday. (fyi my good seller was ""vrlawhorn"")Works great, only one of the many Atlanta stations I listen to not coming in crystal clear. Wire is the thickness of my Nano's USB charger. May paint it black so doesn't stand out so much. Remote is extremely light, and has a shirt clip and hold switch. I can't seem to change the rating stars, but I would up it to 4 or 4 1/2."
3,"um, stupid question.","Why not just buy a portable am/fm receiver for like $10?I was looking at this product when it dawned on me, hey, am/fm technology had been evolving for much, much longer than Apple (or anyone) has put into this. Why not use it?just a thought."
2,Broken wire inside the cord,"I was really pleased with this item, but after a year, it seems that one wire inside the cord is broken so I started having some ""contact"" problems and now is completely unusable. It was a deception after paying $50 for it."
5,Cool Ad On Feature,"I purchased this with my iPod Nano, and I am glad I did. I purchased it because I wanted to be able to listen to a radio stations count down when I was out walking, so I ordered this. I like that you have the channel you are on displayed on the screen, and this does get great reception too! Another cool feature is that you do not have to have your iPod to change the station with the cool little remote - and Apple even includes another set of headphones! I was not aware that the remote was going to work also with the the music part also which is great also allowing me to put my iPod away and control everything from the remote - that clips onto your pocket, or shirt or wherever you want to clip it!"
2,Not very impressed.,"I receive few stations clearly with this product. I live in New Brunswick, NJ.Considering the price tag, I must say that I was expecting more."
4,"good for radio, if you already have your presets","It pulls in all the stations and they sound clear. My only problem is with the tuning. The remote only controls volume and switching from preset stations, which is not helpful when you're travelling. It would have been nice to be able to switch between each frequency as well, or if there was some sort of station search function. I i know they want to keep it simple with the buttons, but I feel they could control all the functions I mentioned with the current arrangement of buttons."
3,iPod Radio Remote Has Poor Audio,"The iPod radio remote, while convenient, has extremely poor audio quality. I use it to watch TV while running at the gym and I find it very difficult to understand the broadcast. Of course, the quality of the audio for the music saved on the iPod is fantastic, so the contrast between the two makes the radio seem even worse."
4,ipod radio remote,"Remote is very handy, especially in a car. I wish the screen had color options, however."
3,Great for radio & remote operation; bad for battery life,"Since I've yet to transfer most of my CDs onto my ipod, having a radio option has been fantastic (helps undercut some of the monotony). While, yes, the extra cord can be a hassle, the remote -- which I clip onto my shirt or jacket while walking in the city -- has more than made up for that inconvenience. My main issue is the battery life. I hesitate to use the radio as often as I'd like because it drains the battery pretty darn fast. If I listen to the radio for the entire commute to work (about 40 minutes), I know I won't be able to listen to it for the entire ride back."
2,Reliability problems,"Nice features but poor construction--mine broke after about three months of normal use. The connection (in the remote) went bad, so I now only get sound in one earphone. There's no warranty to speak of."
1,JUST A RIP OFF!!!!,"Many owners are asking why the FM tuner is not built in the ipods. I would say this is really built in with the video ipods and the nanos. This overpriced remote is just used to activate the FM tuner built in the ipods. I'm saying this because I'm comparing it with my cellphone, Nokia 7210. It has a built in radio but it can only be used when the headset is plugged in at the bottom of the phone as you would plug in this remote at the bottom of the ipod. This is also the reason why this will only work with video ipods and nanos, not with the old ipods. Because the old ipods doesn't have this fm tuners built in, only the new ipods have.And I agree with all the reviews that by using this overpriced remote all other accessories that uses the dock become useless, like the speakers with docking station."
2,no provision to record??,Expensive for something that can't record radio broadcasts.Too bad Apple didn't engineer this to do timed recordings of radio broadcasts like the Griffin Radio Shark USB computer tuner.
3,is it a good design?,"THE BAD:*just work on ipod 5G or Nano.*just como in white color.*expensive, more if you dont use the ipod earphones.*only comes with FM band, I know the AM antena could not fit fine on the small size of an ipod, but its a bad thing anyway.*why does the radio doesnt work wiht just the headphones, is the radio hardware on the remote? or just a seller trap.*Forgot to use youre ipod with the remote on youre car at same time you charge the ipod with an ac adapter. so it only works for special situations. forgot about use it like a car radio mp3 with autonomy of bateries.THE GOOD:*mmmm ok its a good accesorie if you dont have enouhg music on 30 or 60 GB*for hearing news or especial programs on the radio*the posibility to operate the ipod while its on your backpack jacket or something like that.Well think all of this and wish they keep developing good accesories."
5,Love it!,I use it when I'm snowboarding. It's pretty awesome. I could control my music without much hassle. I got another one for my gf. I recommend this item.
5,I Told You So by Carrie Underwood,"I love the song,"" I Told You So"". I purchased this song by Carrie Underwood, who sings it so beautiful, I can listen to it over and over."
4,Good Brush,"This is an excellent brush. The only problem is cleaning it! I'm not sure if this is a problem with every airbrush, but it seems to always be clogged. Make sure you clean it very VERY well after each use. Take it apart, clean it out, and soak it after each use. A very good, low-cost double-action airbrush. I would recommend it."
3,Double Action Air Brush Kit,"Good kit. Instructions are poor for making adjustments to the paint flow. Tried using it for painting HVAC return grates, but took too long. Had to revert to a large automotive detail sprayer to get the job done in a shorter time.Probally good for art and real small items that need spraying."
2,Doublel Action Air Brush,Bought this for my daughter who likes doing specialty painting. She said she had a problem with this sprayer clogging up even after thinning down the paint. She said it wasn't very user friendly with different types of paint. Wouldn't advise anyone buying this product. She has used better ones.
1,should have known better,"THE GARBAGEMAN COMES ON FRIDAY...............!!!!!I just wanted something inexpensive that could familiarize me with a airbrush but, this P.O.S. started falling apart right out the box.....why do vendors do this. . .??? for Christ-sakes leave the junk in China...So the only thing I really got was the cheap....or is that poop. . . ???"
2,Don't buy on the strength of the author's name!,"I purchased this book simply because it was written by Tanya Huff. I was sorely disappointed, as it remains true to the world of Ravenloft(I would assume, although I admit to not having read any others) at the cost of Ms. Huff's usual engaging characterization and INTERESTING plot developments. While from someone else, I might consider this an average read, I can only class it as below the norm for a writer who typically lures you in from page one and keeps you enthralled and entertained to the very last. I am glad that subsequent publications have restored my faltering faith"
2,Ok,"Bought this for my grandson, the cover looks vey colorful and exciting, but the inside even though it has lots of ideas, is vey uninspiring and dull and black and white. A couple of color photos would have gone a long way to improve this book"
1,Garbage! Trash! Escondido PD Propaganda!,"What Detectives Claytor, Wrisley and McDonough did to a 14-year-old child was absolutely horrid and evil. I wonder if they regret or have the intelligence to realize what they did was sick and pathetic -- grown professional (not!) men mentally torturing an innocent child. I hope they never work in law enforcement again. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK -- IT IS GARBAGE! A better book to read is ""Shattered Justice"" by John Philpin."
1,Don't give them money!,"I have lived in Escondido my entire life and our entire community lived through this horrible case. According to what Det. Craytor said at the time this book was written, he is supposed to get 20% of sales after the cost of self printing. This is a cop out of control, who tortured three boys and ignored real evidence until others had to finally catch and convict the real killer - now serving his time (Tuite). Ralph Craytor ""retired"" after this case and moved out of state. And even in another unrelated case, another family sued and won $750,000 settlement against the Escondido Police Department because of Claytor's bad policing. We are glad he moved out of state. Don't buy the book and give them any more money than our taxes are paying his retirement fund - he doesn't deserve it! Plus, this book leaves out some major facts in the case...don't contribute to the tragedy."
1,Low Quality Book,This book was nothing you couldn't have found and read in a newspaper from when this murder happened...This book sucked just like professor Tracy sucks!
5,Amazing!!!highly recommend,"I love cooking and I used many pans but I didn't satisfy .When I used this pan, I find this pan is really good and stickless.And also very light .Highly recommend!!"
4,good product except the handle,"i like it, big enough to cook for few people. The only thing i don't like about this pan is the handle. It is very hard to pick up this big pan with the wooden round handle. I have to use both hands (left hand to hold the handle and right hand to hold the opposite side of the handle) when picking it from the stove. Of course i use a pot holder on my right hand so that i don't burn my right hand."
3,Separating the myth adds a myth,"The author tries to separate the myth from the man and does offer some interesting analysis from his cynical viewpoint. But in debunking the myth, his point of view oversteps and creates another myth. The reader must continually weed these opinions from the facts, which he weaves in, back and forth in chronological time, using this device to often repeat his criticism, both real and imagined. Being published in 1969, Daniel James was at the disadvantage of writing soon after the events, but he does manage to make some interesting analysis when he's not too busy alienating Che."
5,A Wonderful Torah Text for Beginners,"What a delight! This text makes understanding Torah easier for beginners, either adult beginners and for Bar or Bat Mitzpha students. The text is too simple for scholars. Every non scholarly student of Torah should read and use as a guide to Torah."
4,alabama fan,I really enjoyed this book. It gives a good account of Alabama football and its history. Eli really tells a good story.
3,solid scifi with bleak detail and pessimism,"This is an excellent hard scifi novel, with a cynical view on how man will continue to be self-serving in spite of the technological changes that are sure to come. PKD really knows how to tell a story, with imagined details that make for believability and relate well to the narrative. The characters are quite strong and the language elegant.The plot is about a fallen heir, who is coping with his creditors and wondering what to do next. The context is one of economic morass, with Europe split up - Germany is ascendant with a teleportation device that allows colonization of distant planets, which are portrayed as the promised land. Of course, the heir finds unexplained things and sets out to understand them. The results are wonderfully unexpected.REcommended."
1,"New CD ""King Creole"" big mistake","I don't know why these RCA folks keep putting take one, take two take six, just leave the recordings and the CD as it should be in its original form (it don't need any more songs either).It is a great CD without all the other crap they add on to it, one of his best. You can't make it any better so leave it along!"
4,GREAT,The ESL students enjoy playing Bingo on lazy Friday afternoons. It is good for all levels and all grades. Thank you
5,Great Structured Black Metal,"This is a really good band. I think they call themselves Unanimated because they are all talent black metal musicians with no corpse paint. Definatly reminds me of Dissection and the guitar solos remind me of Nevermore. They can stay evil and still put forth a beautiful sound. This is one of the few bands that can conjure images in my mind (other than gore and Christian slaying madness). ""Fire Storm"" is a great example of this with wailing screams of sadness and piercing guitar solos. The drummer reminds me of the drummer of Dissection on ""Storm of the Light's Bane"" and plays pretty consistant blast beats. They also incorporate the acoustic guitar on a few songs such as ""At Dawn"". Any fans of black metal like Dissection, Setherial or Opeth should definatly pick this up."
3,Reliable when undamged,"These discs have normally been reliable for me, even though they do tend to make more noise in my recorder than other brands of DVD-RAM cartridges, such as EMTEC (which I can no longer find) or the Verbatim branded discs.However, 1 of the 2 Panasonic discs that I ordered recently had been crushed on the end, prior to shipping, which prevented the shutter cover slide from closing properly. I returned it to Amazon only to receive a replacement with similar damage. Rather than return that one too, I instead took the doubled-sided disc out of the cartridge and will just use it that way.While I can't be sure where the damage happened (at the factory or at Amazon's warehouse?), I will be avoiding the Panasonic discs for a while, unless I can see them before buying."
2,Title Description Contradictory,"The title description says DVR double sided disc, then further down in the product information it says it's a DVD double sided disc. Which is it?????"
2,Unacceptable,"This geometry book has thought provoking problems, but that is all that is good about this book. There are many typos and awkward wordings to be found, and even incorrect answers in the teachers edition (my teacher has been correcting answers in his book all year)! This book is also useless without the only conjectures and vocabulary, something that should have been included in an appendix somewhere in this book! If you want to learn geometry, this is not the book to use."
4,Geometry textbook...a life-saver,I'm tutoring this summer and this is the book that my student will be using in HS this Fall. THANKS!
4,"It's a mystery! No, a biography! It's both and it's good.","This book is a mystery novel, journalist's feature story and biography all in one. Telling the story through the author's attempts to uncover the truth surrounding Wallis' life after the death of the Duke keeps the suspense-level high. It grabbed my interest and held it to the end. If you are at all interested in the Windsors' story, this book completes the story of Wallis' life and gives a few more details about their lives that previous books have not."
2,Read only if you must read everything about Mrs. Simpson,"This book was checked out of the library by mistake...having mixed it up with another book. I tried to read this and just had to ask myself ""why am I bothering?"" And why did Caroline Blackwood waste her time in ""researching"" this book and tracking down former friends of Wallis Simpson who, if they were still alive, were not very willing to talk and usually couldn't remember much anyway. The time period of the book is after the duke's death and her last days in Paris as a widow carefully guarded by her French attorney. It is the attorney who is really at the center of the book and quite a nasty bit of work by all accounts. Still, this is a most tedious read about very uninteresting people. I gave up about 25% through. Your mileage my vary."
2,Dreary,"I slogged through this book to the end, thinking to find a mystery revealed or a message of import shared. In that sense, the book was successful. But nothing was revealed, and no important message was shared; just a bleak litany of human weakness, banality and parasitism. The author herself - and her sponsoring newspaper or magazine, and the photographer - became collaborators in the alleged exploitation of the Duchess of Windsor."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND $$,I bought this dvd set hoping to see a lot of interviews from the band..what a dissapointment!! there are very few spots where the guys from the band are being interviewed. its just a bunch of Pink Floyd knock-off and wanna be critics giving their opinions..the concert footage is VERY poor. save your time and money..don't buy this set..its a waste of money..buy Pinks Floyds concert dvd's and see the REAL Pink Floyd..
1,Stupid beyond belief,"I had to stop and play over to be sure I heard right when the narrator dismisses Piper as for ""for completeists but not essential.""Yup, that's what he said alright, so you draw your own conclusions."
3,early writings,"For all you regular Dean Koontz fans who don't recognize this title, it is because it was one of his very early books. Originally published back in 1974! That may be the reason some people might not enjoy this writing."
1,Horrible book!,"By far Koontz's worst book! Unless you are one of those fans who has to read everything that he's wrote, don't waste your money. Instead spend it on his IMHO best book Strangers."
4,This CD is excellent!,"This CD is great - but not for mainstream listener.And that is not just another snoby review :)This album is weird, but it's full of nice instrumental tricks and ideas. May be it's not perfect or genius, but it's interesting - especially for those who appreciate a bit less mainstream and more experimental."
3,What the ???,"This is a real mix of grindcore and straight psychedelic craziness. The combination is really rather disturbing. The production sounds like it could've been a LOT better. The guitars sound like they're going direct, and the vocals are all kinda muddy. This is an album for those into death metal and are looking for something that's just completely off the wall experimental. I like the CD for the unusual originality, but if you listen to it for too long at one time it may make one go crazy. No other artist I've ever heard sounds anything remotely like this."
4,Good book but not complete,Good book for the most part but lacking in good material covering the V$ performance view and DBA static views which crop up excessively in the test especially in relation to chapters 4 - 7 (memory and I/O) tuning. A little week on the MTS views also which shocked me when I took the test.Should use this book along with Tuning section from standard Oracle8i documentation and V$ and DBA views from Reference section also from standard Oracle8i documentation.
3,Buy Exam Cram First,"On p. 55 the book has a review question that says: ""The data store in the V$ views are generally lowercase."" I find this claim to be wrong. I looked at the V$ views of our company database and I found about half of the contents are in either upper case or upper-case initialized.I still find this book to be a valuable learning tool for DBA exams. It covers about all the basic requirements of the exams. It does not have deep ideas and reasonings, but as DBA you probably don't need too much reasoning anyway.My advise: buy the exam cram books first. They are very good. If you still cann't do it after reading the exam cram books, then buy this book. If you have trouble with Oracle/Database concepts, then I would suggest you also buy the Jason Couchman book (Oracle8 DBA Certification Exam Guide) before you buy this book."
4,Performance Tuning incomple but enough to pass,"My Performance Tuning exam study was completely based on this book and I passed. However, I had a few surprises on the exam; there were certain things that were not even mentioned in the book. I did 80%. For my previous exams, I'd used books in this series but I had also studied Oracle lecture notes and I had made more than 90%. For Performance Tuning exam, don't forget to study the MTS chapter, which is in the Network Administration section of the book. There will be several questions on the subject."
5,I Found It!,"I am very surprised I found this, I found it in a store called ""Monsters In Motion"" Its a store for horror films and stuff and I found some copies of it in the soundtrack section.This is Young's second best score the first is Hellraiser 2 my favorite is track 1.The only question I have is why didn't this score go to the Academy Awards?I mean this score is better than The Amityville Horror and it was nominated(I'm not saying Amityville is a bad score though)this score went unrecognized by the Academy and even the Golden Globes and Grammys.If you just happen to stumble upon a copy buy it.Oh and I also found the soundtrack to Hellraiser Bloodline!!!!,but it wasn't at the same store."
2,Not my favorite,"i had to read this book for a class and was very dissapointed in it. instead of telling a story this book layed out the facts like a us history text book. It basically was a textbook without the pictures. it was very hard to finish, but i did learn."
5,a very illuminating history of the American Revolution,"Mr Bobrick presents a very thoughtful and thorough history of the American Revolution. One cannot read this work and not come away with a sense of awe for George Washington and The founders of the American Republic. The final paragraph of the book is a most poignant statement of the charater of these men and the revolution. One also senses the brutality of the war, the strenghts and weakness of the players, and the deep divisions within the population. I also found a couple of minor erroneous details that distracted from the overall excellence of the work. Even so, Mr. Bobrick has presented an unsanitized and detailed picture of the revolutionary war in a very readable book."
5,great overview of this era in history!,"a most enjoyable read - if you like history and want a good, concise history of the war for independence this is the book for you."
5,"Wonderful, interesting and inspiring","I was searching for a ""first"" to read related to the American Revolution. I read the reviews and decided this one looked good. Diligent and determined shopping usually pays off for me and this was no exception. This book is great. Even for an occasional reader as myself, I found it hard to put down. It made me proud to be an American. And I am impressed with the candor and honesty of the writer. I'm a Christian and I found this book to be full of references to our founding fathers strong faith. If that is important to you, then don't miss this one. I've tried reading John Adams since, but can't get interested. It just doesn't pull me in like ""Angel"" did."
3,Dry as a bone...with nary a map to wet my whistle...,"Mr. Bobrick has assembled a thorough overview of the American Revolution, and more specifically those challenges faced by George Washington in fighting a war against the most powerful nation in the world at the time. However, the volume's lack of detailed maps left me with a confusing sense of space and time as it related to the movements of the armies. It is easy to jump from Saratoga, NY to Yorktown, VA in just a few dozen pages, but without giving the reader some sense of the distance involved, or even the spatial relationship between these large bodies of men, Mr. Bobrick's concise text loses meaning."
3,"Complete, yet....","Mr. Bobrick has assembled a thorough overview of the American Revolution, and more specifically those challenges faced by George Washington in fighting a war against the most powerful nation in the world at the time.

5,good as it gets,"This is the best and most readable overview of the American Revolution I have ever read. The personality of George Washington, in particular, comes vividly to life; that he was indispensable to the events that took place is completely clear after reading this book. The material is detailed and yet moving and very readable. I couldn't put it down. I wish high school students would read it. I believe they'd understand their unique heritage as Americans if they did."
5,Blublocker,These are the best sunglasses I have ever had. I had a pair for ~10 years then they broke. :-( I was so happy to see that they were still available.
3,I think Milky had equine A.D.D.,"This book was a good addition to the SC. In it a new horse named Au Lait, or Milky, comes to Pine Hollow. Lisa thinks her parents are planning to buy Milky for her and convinces Max to let her ride him. But things aren't going well: the horse shies, bucks, rears, and sometimes is just plain mean. Lisa continues riding him, hoping things will get better. But they don't.:(I must say I completely disagree with what Max says at the end of the book. It's only my opinion, but I think Milky had equine A.D.D. (yes, there is such a thing). And there are treatments for it. No horse would act like this unless it were health related- or abuse. Just my opinion, and it was a pretty good book overall."
2,They All Speak French,"Lisa was the one who went on the trail ride with Mr.French and spoke entire conversations, She also helped Stevie with her French when she and Veronica were failing, but they both claim that they have never taken it? Come On!"
4,Pretty Good,"I don't ride but I love these books, Schooling Horse was a great one about Lisa. They focus on Stevie a lot so I liked hearing about Lisa. Anyway, the plot of this book is very interesting although throughout the whole thing I was wishing that Lisa would just get her own horse already! I really do reccomend it, I find that each book teaches me more about Horses. This one is no exeption. Read it! :-)"
2,Boring,"This book was boring.It almost put me to sleep trying to read it.I have an objection.I think Max is to strict.I think the rule he has about how you have to a C-average or you can't ride.Why should he care what your grades are.Plus,why do Stevie and Carole(not Lisa,though)always worry about whether they can ride or not if they get a bad grade?All they have to do is not tell Max if they get a REALLY bad grade.I mean what does do,go snoop in your bookbag for your report card whenever your not looking.That's just plain crazy. If you get a bad grade it's your parents job to handle it, not your riding instructors job.-sorry to put you put you down like that Bonnie, but I think it's a stupid rule."
3,It works,Guess I should have read all the information prior to buying. You are tied to a cord because there are no batteries. It works.
3,"Dated, but otherwise excellent book for early BBCs","This book shows its age...just like the Big Block Chevy itself! It is a collection of articles reprinted from various Hot Rod magazine titles by recognized authors of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Generally, I'd recommend this book for everyone with a 396 or 427 since it has a lot of nostalgic value but also because it has a lot of hard-to-find detail not often found in other publications. My favorite section was the ""Proven Performance"" article where CJ Baker details how to build a reliable 650HP 427. The parts shopping list is a bit antiquated and most of the brand names shown won't easily be found on a web page so you can order up the parts. I like the book because it is clearly focused on these two engines and it presents what you should already know...a Big Block Chevy with a little work will make a ton of power rather inexpensively."
5,Umbrella base review.,This is a new base for a new market umbrella that I recently purchased. It was inexpensive and serves the purpose. I think it is a good product and I had similar one like it that lasted 16 years. Thanks
2,umbrella stand,Don't waste your money on this cheap product and buy yourself a metal one.It wouldn't even accept the largest size pole it claims to hold.
5,excellent basic umbrella stand,"Umbrella base arrived quickly. Basic umbrella stand at a very inexpensive price. Great, if you need to have stands for several umbrellas and don't want to spend a great deal of money."
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,This was a total waste of money. It doesn't even hold up an umbrella. This is a good example of you get what you pay for. Take my advise and don't waste your money.
1,useless,"These are completely useless for a free standing umbrella, though may work with a table for stabilization. They just don't have the weight or spread for free standing."
4,Great for the price,"Works great for what we need. Have had no problems in the 6 or so months we've been using the stand, and for the price it can't be beat! I only wish they'd had a darker color since our patio set dark."
3,CAN BUY ONLY AS AN USED OR REFURBISHED PRODUCT,Performs as advertised. I had used the identical model before it broke down after moderate use.Compatible with the AIRLINK printer server I bought at sale price at Fry's.The left side cover has to be removed to connect the printer cord. Both the removal and replacement are tricky. The printer may become inoperable if you do not close it properly.
2,Poor Performance for Birkenstock!,"These things are basically a greatly overpriced Dr. Scholl's pad. At nearly $30 they are just a foam, latex pad with a sort of Birkenstock arch support. If you want a Birkenstock insole you'll have to cough up the bucks to get one of their hard insoles because this will not do squat!"
4,Comprehesive but a bit outdated,I read 20% and find it useful but some information may be outdated since the time they wrote it was 2003.
1,The WORST book I have ever wasted my money on,"What a complete and utter WASTE of money. As we are pushing 2009, this 2002 (!!!) info is 100% OUTDATED and USELESS. It is full of erroneous information as well as outdated information. Approximately 1/10 of the book actually addresses shipping an RV to Europe (Again, COMPLETELY OUTDATED info). The rest is filler along the lines of ""you should go to Europe, it's fun""...DUH! I emailed amazon.com suggesting they remove this item from their inventory."
5,Easy,"Every other day keeps the reds redder and plants overall do much better. Love the company, use all their products for plants fertz and healthy water."
4,"Very good product, it does its job","i was very upset when this product arrived because it was leaking through the box, literally DRIPPING. once i got over the fact that i had lost alot of the product, i began to use it and it does make a difference if used regularly and regimen maintains consistent. This product is nice because it does have a sufficient concentration. but since ive purchased, ive switched to Dry ferts and they provide more effectively, in my opinion. but flourish Iron is still a good product, if its shipped properly"
2,What an amazing!,"First time When I found this book... It was very nice for me. because of this book I could win a biology olympiad(Not for this only..) And I could fix my conceptions about the genetics. It is explain the conceptions very easily and widely. But it's shortcoming is that it has not so many pictures for understanding the conceptions easily. But this book is good, I think."
2,"Mannix, Great Show BAD DVD!","basically this was a bad VHS recording copied directly to DVD. The picture quality is very poor, with lots of grain and dust. The sound is also very muted.I only gave this 2 stars because I really love this show and would like to see it on DVD in high quality.The writing on this show is 5 star (Levinson and Link of COLUMBO fame)And the show is produced by Bruce Geller (Mission Impossible)Com'on Guys lets do it right."
2,It sure smells like a bootleg... looks like one too.,Come on guys! Let's do it right -- Joe deserves better.I'm surprised Amazon is even dealing with dodgy stuff like this.
4,Luscious Summer Fun,My wife and I are now enjoying the Summer after buying this fun book of mostly drink and Latino Summer Finger foods!
5,Elvis fan,Having been looking for Jail House Rock for some time. Should have come to Amazon to begin with. They always have what I want.
3,Helloween--Kids of the Century,"Taken as the first single from Pink Bubbles Go Ape, Kids of the Century is a good mid-tempo thumper about how we all get wrapped up in ourselves and forget about the important things in life. Basically, a really good tune. Also included is the Carl Perkins classic Blue Suede Shoes that Elvis Presley made famous. This song was recorded because Michael Kiske is a big Elvis fan. A decent cover of the song, and a nice treat to include as a b-side. The third ""track"" on the album is an interview conducted with Michael Kiske and Ingo Schwichtenberg talking about the material on Pink Bubbles Go Ape. If you are lucky enough to find the four-track version of Kids of the Century, you will enjoy the track You Run With The Pack. This is an excellent song and really should have been included on Pink Bubbles Go Ape. But that is not the case here, sorry. Still, this single is pretty cool to have."
4,Lessons on success from the athletic arena,The New Dynamics of Winning illustrates how to use lessons and techniques from sports and transfer them to your career and personal life to succeed.
4,Liquid fencd,The package was complete. It was a more economical way to buy this product than at the local garden stores. I just wish it worked for a longer time.
5,Best Dog A Day Calendar Out There,I get the calendar from this company every year and absolutely love it. I was forced to get a different calendar one year because I couldn't find this one -- I think the other may have been the Dog Fancy one -- and the pictures and captions weren't as nice. I highly recommend this calendar for all dog lovers.
3,TOY,Product is grweat for kids but watch out for shipping charges. Toy was a good value until you got to the shipping.
4,"HIS BEST, I THINK","WELL, AT LEAST HE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE HE IS SINGING SHAKIRA/METRONOME. HE'S GOT REAL TALENT, BUT I STILL CANNOT SIT THROUGH A WHOLE RECORD OF HIS EXCEPT THE FIRST AND THIS ONE. HERE HE SHOWS THE MAKINGS OF A CANTAUTOR, LIKE AZNAVOUR, ADAMO ETC. A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SOME EXQUISITE SONGS. JUST NO DEFINITION YET."
5,The Truth About Love,This book is like tasting the best dessert of the buffet. Everyone writes about love. This is the real thing. I believe anyone who reads this with an open heart will actually experience God's love for themselves -- directly.
3,Just OK,"Well, I have toured this Palace and I wanted a document to remember the fantastic interiors. This DVD is better than nothing but it does leave out many rooms, and much history.Mike Barrett, Baltimore"
4,Had to have it!,"When I heard a cut off this album on Satellite Radio, I just had to write it down and buy it for myself. This is an excellent album that I have played over and over. Adani & Wolf are on my buy list from now on! Good stuff."
4,mellow and calming,this is really new age music that you would commonly hear in hotels and eclectic forums.
5,Cartoons for Generation X-,"This collection brings together some of Hilary Price's best comic strips. Written with an eye toward the 20-40 year old crowd, they deal with the humor in everyday subjects: dating/couplehood, work, cats and dogs, parents, holidays. Sometimes the cartoons are just quirky, but often Price hits on some universal truths. Those cartoons - poignant but funny - are the ones that end up on refrigerator doors, file cabinets, bulletin boards and, in my house, bathroom counters."
4,Nice,"I ran across this as I was looking for some other cleaning items. I have been storing my brushes tubes they came in and while that works at least one has started to crack. I won't even talk about the jags as they are simply strewn in my cleaning box. This lets me organize things a little better.They are really sturdy and the picture doesn't quite convey the size - including the upper area that can fit another item. So, depending on size you can get at least 4 brushes/jags in here. And that's my only knock. I would have liked a bit of a bigger option, but my guess is this is more about being able to throw something in the range bag. Reality is that for a bench there may be other options (screw containers or a lure tray even), but this works for me."
2,Beth the Martyr,"Good idea behind the book but the main character Beth is extremely annoying. Beth is not a very happy person and uses her son's kidnapping as an excuse to be an even more miserable individual. She takes it out on her family, a lovable bunch.Beth is the woman of the 90's you love to loath, selfish and narcissistic. In stark contrast her husband Pat is Ward Cleaver all over again. His heart attack gets her attention and sympathy but only briefly.Don't waste your summer reading on this one--you'll spend way too much time waiting for it to get interesting."
4,Little slow start...but worth it,"I don't even have children, but when I read this book I felt totally like I was experiencing all the emotions right there with Beth. I felt like a fly on the wall during the whole story, like I was experiencing the same emotions of guilt, and frustration. I really enjoyed reading it"
5,Powerfully true to life,"Although many readers did not like the main character, Beth, I felt as though the author had incredible insight as to what a mother might go through in which is what a mother's worst nightmare.When I first realized what the book was about, I put it down for several days and decided not to read it. Who wants to read a book about the very thing you fear the most? But, since I had nothing good around the house to read I picked it up and spent the next several hours crying and reading, reading and crying.A friend of mine lost a child under very similar circumstances. She was what most people would consider an ideal mother, however, her reaction was so similar to Beth's. She also abandoned her remaining children for a period of time, withdrew from friends and wanted to stop living. I now understand her so much better from reading about Beth."
4,good but frustrating,"Having had a high school reunion in almost the same location described in the first chapters of this book, I was immediately drawn into the story. As a mom I was horrified by the kidnapping. However, the character of Beth was frustrating at times. I thought Vincent's character was complex and interesting, and Mitchard's language and description--choice of words-is often beautiful. The ending was fascinating and horrifying at the same time"
2,Unbelievable,"We are supposed to believe the police would just ignore a tip from someone who thought they saw Ben. Not only the police, but Beth too. I kept wondering why she didn't just drive up there herself and scour the city looking for her son - and Candy who says she looked for him in every city she went to - why didn't she just look in a city where he'd actually been spotted.Despite the obvious flaws - too many characters of which to keep track and unbelievable plot twists - I must admit I finished the book in two sittings."
1,What a waste of time!!!,"I was surprised to learn that one of Oprah's Book Club picks was Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon. I wrote my thesis on Morrison's novels and am a huge fan of her writing. I figured that Oprah might be on to something, here, and so I decided to pursue The Deep End of the Ocean. After all, it was holding its own on the bestseller's list.Little did I know the nightmare I was in for. This novel was so bad, I rushed to finish it just so I could put it out of sight and bemoan the amount of time I had squandered while reading it. Not only was the book completely unbelievable, without the benefit of science fiction thrills and chills, but the timing was pathetically slow, the characters, unrealistic and obtuse (and in Beth's case, melodramatic in the extreme), the dialogue, slow. I'm scared to think that this is what the American majority wants in its fiction. I wonder what Toni Morrison would say."
3,Mixed Reactions from Book Club Members,"A sampling of comments from our book group: ""While the book is probably not great literature, I fee Mitchard captured the various emotional responses to a family tragedy very effectively. I suspect family trauma tears the family structure apart far more often than it draws people together. Mitchard's depiction of the Cappadora family rings true."" ""A suspenseful book - would make a good TV movie. Beth is no one that I could empathize with. She didn't want to be healed and I couldn't stand her for that."" ""I liked the second half of the book better than the first. This may be because I wouldn't let myself relate to the mother or events (i.e. the loss of a child)."" ""It was difficult to read and get into because it seemed too scattered in many directions. I never felt the plot was clearly developed."""
4,This book kept my attention...,"The first half of the book has you frantic, where did little Ben go? The second half had me so depressed for Vincent, the older brother and annoyed at how the whole family acted towards Beth, the mother. The ending was not the thriller that the beginnng seemed to promise it would be. This book is worth reading if you can borrow it, but don't buy it."
1,The color on the jacket cover is the best part of this book!,"The best part of this book is the color on the jacket cover!! It matches beautifully with the colors in my living room. However when I paint my living room, the book goes. I may move up the date on that project. I can't even bring myself to give this book away!! It was awful, the book, not the color of my living room! I am not a mother, however I wonder if a mother in Beth's situation could really have such a lack of compassion and blatant disregard for her childern, her family, her marriage, her friends and herself!! Enough chapters about how long she sleeps!! Was anyone else wishing that maybe she would just sleep herself to death to put us all out of our misery??!! I am embarrased to admit I read the whole thing, just trying to justify the $30.00 I spent on the book! Don't cry for Beth, et al, cry for me, I actually finished this book."
1,Not for mothers,"I was highly dissapointed in this book. If you are a mother of children you know how impossible it is to live like this woman lived. As well as the fact it is impossible to have a favorite child, one may do something you like more than others but there is not favorite. Also you can not know how it feels to lose a child unless you actually have, I know what my mother went through when my brother passed away, and well frankly this book barely touches on those feelings. The story doesn't explore very many things in depth except the mothers feelings and the oldest childs feelings, however the author goes on all these sub plots that she tends to leave hanging. I would not recommend buying this book,it isn't worth your time."
4,better than movie,"If you have seen this movie, but haven't read the book - you really should. The book is one that is hard to put down as opposed to the movie which easily put me to sleep. Book is so much better - the pain of the mother(and the rest of the family) is felt much deeper when reading the book."
1,shallow end of the gene pool,"I can't understand why anyone would bother to write such a trite novel. Hasn't this basic idea been a TV Movie of the Week and a made for TV feature on Lifetime about a dozen times?When you get past your urge to slap the heroine you realize that you really want to slap the author. After that, you just have to live down the shame of letting Oprah sucker you into reading another mediocre novel."
1,Not a good choice,"The deep end of the ocean is where I wanted to chuck this book when I was done with it. It's unbelievably melodramatic and morose in the extreme. The main character (the mother who loses her child) is so unlikable that I was actually hoping the kid could stay with the family that abducted him. Oprah has chosen yet another stinker; have you read ""The Road"" yet? Oy! You'd think I'd wise up and start avoiding anything with her name on it. She has horrific taste."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"A girlfriend suggested I read this book, which I did from start to finish, and I found it to be very depressing. Other reviewers have given a synopsis of the story, so I'll not duplicate their efforts. While I understand the main characters are processing an event I pray no one in this world should have to deal with, I found no hope in the book at all. Even though it has a what most would consider a positive outcome, I sense the characters would not have survived much beyond the window of their lives that we saw.I did not feel my life was any the better for reading it and suggest you search elsewhere for a good story to read."
2,Its BORING,"I liked the story once i finally skipped the 43 page first chapter that talked abpout absoluty nothing. I just didnt enjoy reading the rest of the book, If i wanted to take the time to read a book that long, I would read a good one. i just didnt like reading the same thing over and over again. I skip chapeters at maybe 2 or 3 and still knew what was going on. that to me is not a good story."
2,Highly overrated; often unrealistic,"I found ""Deep End"" to be highly overrated - the story starts off strong enough; in fact, the early chapters are actually quite good. The middle of the book then sags under the weight of a stagnant plot, before coasting downward on auto-pilot for its unrealistic, anti-climactic ending. The emotions of Beth and Vince, which seem genuine and moving at the beginning, quickly become cliche and overdone by novel's end. Some unlikely plot twists and a TV-movie ending add little to the story. The premise is strong, Ms. Mitchard's writing skills are adequate, and of course, the title of the book is memorable and imaginative. That's why its such a shame and a disappointment that these promising parts don't sum to a thrilling and memorable whole."
1,BOR-RING!!!,"I originally picked up the book because I heard it was a best-seller and the plot sounded interesting. Gee, was I ever wrong! It was awful. The pace was slow-moving and the author seemed to not care if we connected with the characters. I did feel a tad sorry for Kerry. She seemed to gain no attention from anyone. Beth was a selfish person- even before the kidnapping. Pat was a wimp. Why did I finish it? Only because I always finish a book no matter how bad it is (and I kept hoping to find some redeeming quality to this book). Why did I give it 1 star? Because I wasn't allowed to give a 0. I am glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought it should've stayed unpublished."
2,A fairly uneventful story,"I decided to read the book instead of seeing the movie. I should have waited for the movie. There are those works of fiction that make better movies instead of books, this is one of them. The story while interesting was not very compelling. The book offered very little in depth to the true aspect to the emotion of grief. What I thought might be a profound testment to the human heart was really nothing more than a story of grief in the form of total abandonment of her other two children and her own selfishness. I was ready to put it down but after I had invested the time in reading over 200 pages, I trodded along to the end, which left me very unimpressed. The point at which this story ended really should have been it's climax. Like I said I should have waited for the movie."
2,She Drove Me Crazy!,"I figured I better do a quick read of this story before going to see it at the movies. Glad I did -- I will probably not subject myself to the frustration again! I just could not figure the mother out. She was supposedly very enamored with her lost child -- why then did she have such a complete disregard for her other children or her husband, for that matter? I cannot see Michelle Pfeiffer in this role. I only continued reading to see the relationship develop between the two boys."
5,Wonderful,"This book is fantastic! The way she writes it is wonderful and very descriptive. You really get to understand all of the characters, realizing a lot about what they are going through when they lose their middle child Ben. Beth is the person I am sure you will understand most. Instead of just wondering, ""how could that woman do that?"" you really know why and how she is feeling. This book is so detailed! Although it isn't all that desriptive in phisical ways, the emotions are so clear. I highly suggest this book! It's long...but I was stuck to it! It's a book you can't put down!"
3,nothing to jump up and down about,"I am an avid reader of the Oprah Book Club selections, and I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the ones I've read. But this particular book was hard for me to become absorbed in, and even though normally I get through a book in two or three days, this novel seemed so slow-moving and arduous that it took me closer to a month to read. I definitely think it had some value, and even though Beth was not the most sympathetic character, I did feel for her and her family (although mostly for her family for having to put up with her!). It's not the worst book you could read, and it definitely is better than the movie, but I can think of 20 or 30 other books right offhand that are probably more worth your time."
2,Disappointing Read,Thankfully this wasn't the first book I read from the Oprah club (Stones from the River got me hooked) or else I probably wouldn't have continued.
1,The worst book I ever finished,Too bad there isn't a zero-star rating. The reason it got such a lot rating: I figured out every one of the plot twists 50 pages before they happened. Michael Crichton also puts plot holes in his books that are large enough to drive a truck through but at least you don't recognize them way ahead of time.
2,Well written but that's it.,"I finished this book because I had to know how it ended. Ms. Mitchard is an excellent writer, and her story moves along at a good pace. Her metaphors work with the story and don't interrupt anything.I really hated the main character, Beth, rather quickly. Chapter 8 sealed for me how much I loathed her and gave me good reason, too. She never redeems herself either. This isn't a book about a family losing their son, it's about a Mom willfully abandoning her entire family. When things get hard, she checks out, and near the very end of the book, when things get harder she decided to physically abandon it all too. The only redeeming aspect of the book is Vincent.I would never re-read this book and I would never recommend it to anyone."
1,DRECK! I would give it negative stars if that were possible.,"DRIVEL - a waste of paper and a TOTAL waste of time. Losing a child is an unbelievable tragedy. I can only imagine. However,the mother in this book just made me want to slap her silly. Do not waste your money. Her self-centered absorption is beyond credibility and tolerance."
1,Lowest of All,"This book ranks as the worst book that I have ever attempted to read. The mother was unbelievable. She was like a stork with her head stuck somewhere that it didn't belong. She didn't behave like a parent whose child had disappeared. I said that it was the worst book that I have ever attempted to read because I could not force myself to finish it even though it was going to be discussed at my book club. I put it down after reading one hundred pages. A week later, I picked it up and decided to do something that I had never done before. I skipped all the way in the book to a point that was about four chapters from the end. I did find out what had happened to the missing child but the book was still unreadable. I didn't even read the last two chapters. Pure nonsense!"
2,"Could have been great, but...","This book could have had it all: a great plot, twists and turns, tons of emotion. But alas, it fell short."
3,RIVETING BUT LACKING IN VIDEO,"I listened to this book on audio while commuting to work over 2 weeks time. I was quite impressed with the story and looked forward to its continuation each day. I found the language/characters/setting interesting and text well written. But a few months later when I viewed the video, I was truly disappointed. I was so bored I couldn't wait for the movie to end. M Pfiffer is a favorite actress of mine and her character in this movie was plagued with flaws......at times so blase. The other characters were blase as well. The book held my attention. I suppose I should have viewed the movie first-----this was a first for a book that I read then viewed the movie, and was not impressed with the movie. Maybe this book wasn't meant for the 'big screen'."
4,Great book,I got this because it was on Oprah's book list and I loved it. I think she is a great author. I thought it was such a sad story but it was so believable. As a mother with a small child it really scares you. I really liked it. I highly recommend it.
2,"C'mon, Oprah...you can do better than this!","I started out reading this book with high expectations. Ichose it mostly because of it being on Oprah's list, but was prettydisappointed in it. For one thing, if my 3 year old had been abducted I think I would have gone berserk, not sat at the bar downing drinks. It didn't seem that she was all that concerned about her son being missing. Besides that, it was a pretty blah storyline. Kind of a disappointment like Oprah's other selection I read, ""Map of the World"". END"
4,DO NOT READ MASS MARKET PAPERBACK! LOTS OF EDITING MISTAKES!,"I went and read all the 200 and some reviews andto me, It seemed like about half the reviewers loved it and hafl hated it. I also noticedthat a very large group of people thought that it was very poorly edited, now the one in which I read was edited well, so i was a little suspicious and I obsereved that the ones who were complaining were the ones who read the Mass Market PaperBack, now I read the hardcover version and it was good but like others, I did not care for Beth she was deffinatley not an ideal mother. If i were you I would RENT this book from the LIBRARY and be sure NOT to get the MASSMARKET PAPERBACK. As I said, I read the HARDCOVER version and it did not have many editing mistakes."
3,"Good, but drags..","I truly liked this story. It really puts you in the place of the mother and older brother Vincent. It paints a very sad picture of a family torn in two. Throughout the book trials and tribulations are presented to the family in many ways. Sam's disappearance devistates the family. It makes you really live what Beth as a mother and Vincent as an older brother go through. It was a pretty good book, but I thought it was a slow and kindof boring read. I did apreciate the story line."
3,It was both a great and not so great....,"Depressing? Yes. Well written? Yes. This story truly is every mothers worst nightmare. But as a mother, I feel it worthy to know about the horrors of the world so I read and become more aware to the point of paranoid at times. Anyway, I don't hate Beth. The mistake she made could be anyone's. I don't think I could survive a child of mine being taken. I can't say I could be strong for my other children either so I can't judge her. I think I lost a little interest in the book after they found out what happened to Ben. It got a little boring to me. And Reese just pissed me off. You can't blame a child for these things but as he got older he should have tried to be more understanding of his parent's heartache. A good read and I don't regret it."
5,Good books aren't supposed to always be easy to like,"Some of the reviews for this book are amazingly harsh and mean-spirited. I think the book is an amazing first novel. As a mother of toddlers and a pediatrician, I could relate to the not always picture-perfect glimpses of the feelings that mothers often have. Being a woman, a wife, a mother and trying to be a person as well can be difficult; Beth is a realistic, wonderfully flawed character, not a supermom. There are no supermoms. I've read Mitchard in the Milwaukee paper for years and feel I know her; when you read her columns you understand immediately that 1)being a mother is the absolutely most important passion in her life and 2)it ain't always fun or pretty. I can't believe the reviewer who says there was too much description. Why would anyone read a book otherwise? That's what comic strips are for"
2,Let's throw Beth into the deep end and hope she can't swim,"I am also one of the many that bought this book because of Oprah. Was it just me, or was this book bogged down by too many commas? I had to read and reread sentences and was very annoyed by that. I was so distracted, that I noticed a big mathematical error that truly bugged me: If Kerry was a baby in June 1985 when the kidnapping occurred, how was it that she was ""going to be two"" as stated in Chapter 12 which occured in October 1987? Wouldn't she almost be 3? Same kind of error in Chapter 13! Also, I felt cheated by the underdevelopment of Cecil, the kidnapper. I felt that it was a copout that she had mental problems and we didn't get to hear her side of the story. Finally-Beth- couldn't stand her!! I am the mother of a three year old, and I couldn't imagine acting such as she did."
2,Victims make lousy protagonists,"Beth's response to Ben's kidnapping may have been realistic, but it was also boring. I just am not interested in reading about a character who sits around being miserable for page after page. Almost any other character would have made a more interesting protagonist. The second star is for this potential, which was unfortunately not realized. I read this on a long flight with nothing else to read. Otherwise, I doubt I would have finished it. *Yawn*"
2,This novel does not live up to its billing.,"I purchased THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN right after Oprah recommended it, but just got around to reading it last week. I thought the entire book was too contrived and I had a hard time plowing through it, even though I was determined to finish it to see what happened. I thought some characters, like Pat, were not sufficiently developed, while others, like Candy, were over-developed. The character I felt the most empathy for was Vincent, who never had a chance once Ben was taken. He and Kerry had to make it on their own, and where was spineless Pat? Anyway, sometimes I read Oprah's choices and sometimes I don't. This is one time I wish I hadn't."
2,"oh come on, what's the big deal! Oprah!","Well, the story was boring, Beth was the most awful, selfish, self-absorbed person, whom I hated throughout the whole novel. Her character went dead, she refused to do anything to find Ben and she also ceased to be a mother to her two remaining children. I could NOT identify with her at all. Her obsession with the other guy?! What was that? The story was boring and the ending, a true disappoint and unbelievable."
2,Hard to get into - I was very disappointed!,I bought this book because it is part of Oprah's Book Club. I have always enjoyed the books Oprah has chosen until this one. This book was very hard to follow. I had a hard time getting into it. Jacquelyn Mitchard's writing leaves a lot to be desired. I don't like her style of writing - it's very hard reading. I read A LOT and have NEVER disliked reading a book as much as this one. This was the first and last book of Jacquelyn Mitchard that I will ever read.
1,Don't bother.,"Deep End of the Ocean was real drudgery. . . the endless introspection and emotional turmoil made for an arduous, unpleasant read. I don't mind emotional turmoil, but one has at least to care about the characters, which I didn't. I could not wait for the book to end! The only reason I did manage the end, is not because that is usually my habit unless the book is just too terrible and not because the book was designated by my book group, which it was, but because it was glowingly recommended by a woman who's intelligence I very much respect and who admire a great deal. I kept on trying to figure what she liked about this awful novel and thought that maybe the next page or the next chapter would reveal it. The book was a real grind and I was very glad to finally reach the end and put it aside!"
2,This is the best of the Oprah books...and it ain't good,"Yep, Beth, is cold, unlovable, and unlikable, which is the reason that reading the book is such a chore. If she would ever have made an attempt to help herself, to try to look outside of herself, the reader would be able to empathize. As it is, she is not a mother that anyone would like to have and I ended up feeling like the lost kid got the best end of the deal by getting out of the dysfunctional quagmire. I'm getting overwhelmed with victimization...give me a hero, and if not a hero, give me someone for whom I can at least feel compassion."
4,A very well written but disturbing book.,This was a mother's worst nightmare but I'm not so sure it was bad for Ben. I think he definitely got better treatment from the family who raised him then he would have gotten from his real mother and father. This was also the conclusion his real mother came to. This is a book that will make you think twice about your feelings of kidnapping.
1,"Deep, dark,dopey,don't bother","Painful to read...no glory, no A-Ha Moment. Shlock. I am not a quitter. I finished it. Wish I hadn't picked it up...I trusted Oprah's pick; that was a LONG TIME ago: lesson learned."
3,The deep end of the ocean,"A very well written book. A heart breaking, tragic tale, as you witness a seemingly strong and happy family crumble from within. Well worth reading."
2,Couldn't Get Past Page Fifty,"The reason for this? The auhor appears to think the purpose of novels is to see how long one can drone on about insubstantial things. She does get around to a plot. This is true. The problem is that reading it would require drudging through extraneous paragraphs to reach a light that may or may not be at the end of the tunnel. I don't appreciate this type of writing. To me, it's just not worth the time."
5,The Deep End Of THe Ocean,"One of the best books I've ever read. Dinner didn't get made, the dishes didn't get washed. I getat book!"
3,Nothing to Write Home About,"I was not terribly impressed by this novel. The movie was even worse. The main character was not very sympathetic and the plot was predictable. If you are just looking for a fluff novel or something to read quickly during a beach-side vacation, I would recommend this novel, just don't expect too much."
2,Couldn't wait for it to be over!,"What a big dissapointment! I kept on reading the book hoping something interesting would pop up soon.... I skipped pages just to get to the end. Very, very boring... The relationships between the characters were very unrealistic, very untouching. I hate the Beth character, what a horrible, pathetic woman, I can't find myself to like her one bit! Will not be recommending this to anyone!"
1,Don't Bother,"If this tells you anything, I didn't even bother to read the last fifteen pages of this boring book"
4,Riveting yet depressing,"I finished the book in six days and I found it to be compelling. However, I felt depressed most of the time because of how Beth and the rest of the family felt when they lost Ben. My heart went out to Vincent because in the process of grieving, he got ""lost"" too. He blamed himself for his family's miseries but I felt that Beth, even in her grief, should have remembered that she is still a wife and a mother of two other children. What I did not like about the book was that it was sort of rambling and too detailed"
1,"Uneven rhythm, drawn out prose with letdown ending.","Tough to get immersed into the storyline, then events get drawn out. I really had to work at finishing the book and the ending was a total letdown. Definitely wouldn't read anything more by Mitchard"
2,"poorly written, unbelievable story","I continued to read the book because I was wondering when the good part would happen to redeem the rest of the book. How could Oprah have such bad taste? As a reader one wants to identify/like some of the characters. From Candy Bliss to Beth, it would be hard to find more stereotyped or unlikeable figures. The writing was such trash."
3,Not much to speak of...,"The reading was easy enough, but the characters were not engaging and hardly believable. True, the loss of a child can wreak havoc on a family but I did not feel their pain, nor did I care about their outcome. I had the most trouble identifying with Vincent and Beth was a bit of a struggle as well. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone."
4,A Haunting Tale of Parental Heartbreak,"Buy This Book! I recently finished this book and cannot stop thinking about it. Ben -- the toddler that is kidnapped and forever changes the lives of his ""family"". Beth -- a mother who is taking a lot a critism for being too real. Vincent/Reese -- the older brother who carries so much pain in his own guilt. Pat -- my least favorite character -- is so out of touch with family that he, too, is sadly believable. The only thing that would have made it a better read would have been if more of the storytelling had come from Vincent/Reese's viewpoint. This book is so convincingly real that I cannot believe that the author has not lived this story."
2,The Deep End just got shallower,"The plot was inventive and addressed every parent's worst fear. The characters, though, were too flat and predictable after the first few pages. Patrick, the do-no-wrong husband; Vincent, the guilty child, the nagging in-laws, . .and Beth--just too self-involved. On a positive note, the prose was beautiful in many places and conveyed the sense of loss that anyone in this situation would feel."
2,Meh...!,"I don't abandon books no matter what, I may stop reading it and pick it up again once in a while. If not for my one book a week challenge, it would take years to read this. It was grim, and Beth subsist on being miserable and making people around her miserable and hopeless. She was creative in making her life miserable. I feel bad for the husband and the kids. Their saving grace was their extended family and friends."
4,Couldn't put it down,Mitchard brings every mother's nightmare to life. I read the book straight through without putting it down. A gripping story.
2,"The potential was there, but she blew it","This story began as a real gut-wrencher with a kidnapping and its devastating impact on the victimized family. However, it was difficult to ever sympathize with the mother because she came across as so selfish throughout the book. That could be forgiven, but the ending (which I will not give away) was so ridiculously implausible that it ruined the entire book. By that point the story had pretty much run out of steam anyway, so it would have been difficult for any ending to wrap things up satisfactorily. This book would have gone nowhere had it not been pimped by Oprah."
2,It's Deep Alright.....,"The quote on the front of my book says ""Riveting..twists that will spin you around."" I don't know who at Newsweek wrote that but I'm just an average Jane and not once was I ""spun around"" by something that happened. It was a very depressing book, not riveting. I picked it up and put it down several times, not really caring about the shallow, selfish characters and the only reason I even finished it was because it was the only book in my bag during a long plane ride.A child, Ben, is lost and found again after several years. The book goes through these years focusing on the mother (who doesn't seem to really love any of her children) and the older, tortured, brother who ""told Ben to go away."" This 447 page book could have easily been trimmed down to 150 pages for a better story."
1,I'm glad Beth was never my mother.,"I can proudly (or sadly) say I made it to page 356 of this wretched novel - it was an exercise in discipline. Trudging through quicksand would have been more exiting. By this time, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, with the possible exception of Reese. It was depressing to reach this stage of the book, as it felt like the story had concluded, and yet I saw that I still had over 100 pages to go. Torture in the extreme. What could she possibly have had more to add to this poorly written and utterly improbable story. If you should find yourself stranded on a desert island and this is the only thing to read - build sand castles. I would not only question Oprah's recommendations, but this book only proves that critics often don't have a clue."
1,Didn't hold my interest,"I must admit, I did not finish this book, but it certainly did nothing to hold my interest. It's extremely rare that I read any fiction at all, unless it happens to come highly touted. In this case, I saw the review on Oprah's show and thought it could be interesting. No such luck here! My genre is mostly historical and cultural and I feel this book is mostly superficial fodder and not worth the read, sorry"
2,over rated,"I was disappointed in this book. Maybe I was expecting too much. I have read books with much more to offer the reader. At times the book held my interest, but there were many times that it fell flat. I'm surprised it was so highly recommende"
2,I totally agree with GLEE in an earlier review.,"The only reason this is liked by so many, I think is because it was on Oprah's show.It starts with a great premise than falls flat"
4,Gripping!,"Mitchard turns every mother's nightmare into a gripping tale that runs the gammett of emotions. I could not put the book down, I was waiting to see what range of feelings the author would take me through next. Don't take the shortcut and watch the movie, it didn't do the original novel justice. Pick up The Deep End of the Ocean ASAP, you won't be sorry."
3,Well-written novel with a great plot,"I read this book in 1997 before the movie came out, and I thought to myself, ""they should make a movie about this book!"" Wasn't I right? This compelling novel really was a page-turner for me, and this novel is definately is for people who like to read dramas. It might not be for any kids, though because there are sexual situations in it."
1,"Yes, you can put this book down!","This book came highly recommended to me by a good friend several years ago when it first came out. I wasn't very impressed with it to begin with, and once I had read about 2/3 of it, the story line seemed to end - so I put it down and never picked it back up! I only hope the movie is more interesting than the book!"
1,LAME,"I read this book when it first came out on paperback and I agree with most of the other readers that the story was shallow, especially once we find out who kidnapped the son. The beginning of the book was good, with the rest of it just capturing my attention only because I paid for the book and had already committed myself to reading it and because I did have great hopes that the story would come around and end up giving me a good feeling about the hours spent reading it. Needless to say, the good feelings never materialized."
3,Not a very auspicious start to Oprah's Book Club,"I must have missed something here because there is just nothing going on. What a boring and self-pitying character Beth is. I don't know I just wanted more. Maybe it's the male in me but I felt the same about Fran in Black And Blue. Vincent is a much more convincing character. If you read Mitchard's second book, The Most Wanted, then maybe you'll come to the same conclusion I have: Mitchard writes really convincing young people, something not many other authors do, and something that perhaps she should stick to. The Most Wanted is better but still flawed, so if you like Deep End of the Ocean then make sure you read it too."
3,Rather disappointing.,"Although it was an easy read on a very interesting topic, I found myself disappointed with many things throughout the book. From nickname name changes to the ending (I thought unrealistic). A pretty average, readable book."
1,My first and last read from Oprah's book club,"This book was so disappointing. Talk about a dysfunctional family. Even before the kidnapping, Beth was not ""Mother of the Year"" in my opinion. The writing was disjointed and made me wonder how some books are ever published. I had a difficult time finishing this book, but I made it to the end and then wondered why I bothered. The ending did not redeem this book at all."
3,Fair reading but tedious for pages at a time,"I found the subject material riveting, but was disappointed in the page upon page of emotional craziness. I felt compelled to skip or ""speed read"" 3 or 4 times during the book because the sense of what the character was feeling was already clear. This made some sections redundant and boring. Over all, I would say, borrow it from a friend for some light reading. It definately isn't a book you will ever reread or excitedly pass it on to your best friend."
2,"This book is readable, but depressing and frustrating.","The horrifying story of the kidnapping and the emotional problems of the family compelled me to read late into the night and finish the book. BUT, I was left with an ugly, let-down, depressed feeling. I sympathized with Beth at first, but when she never learned from her mistakes she became obnoxious. Frustrations were many--the main one, I haven't read from anyone else's review: I KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING WHO THE KIDNAPPER WAS!!! Didn't anyone else? It was obvious! And I really wanted to see more of the police investigation! (Also annoying: the edition I read was full of typos, which I usually don't even notice.) This should have been a better--even a great--book."
3,Doesn't deliver on expectations it creates.,"Deep End of the Ocean is written a little too sensitively for my taste. It starts out engrossingly, with the disappearance of a three-year-old boy. But it peters out, and the seemingly relentless story takes the reader nowhere in the end"
2,I kept reading because I had to find out how it would end.,I was certainly disappointed in this book because I had heard it was so good and it was on the best seller list. I kept waiting for more substance but if it was there I really didn't see it. It was a very emotional book that seemed to show a family in destruction. Beth seemed to me a woman who did in fact look for things to be miserable about. I really kept expecting more but didn't get it
1,The True Mystery Is That I Kept On Reading,"This book droned on chapter by boring chapter. Although loosing a child must be one of the most profoundly painful experiences a mother could have, mid-way through the book I lost interest in Ben's return. Beth was pathetic and many events simply were not believable. The true mystery is how Oprah convinced so many viewers to read this book. Unfortunately, I was one of them"
1,A Big Disappointment,"The cover and the title and Oprah drew me in. But I do not understand what all the hype is about! The characters are predictable, the story is not well written, and the end dragged on and on. I only finished it because I like to finish everything I read. I had hoped it would get better at the end, but it only got worse and worse."
1,Don't Waste Your Money and Time,"I give this book a 2 for the first chapter or so. It kept my attention somewhat, but then dragged on and on. Plus, Beth is so self centered and unlikeable. What a depressing story! There was not one redeeming quality. I counldn't wait for this book to end."
3,The horrror of losing a child!,When Beth Cappadora goes to her high school reunion it all happens. One minute he's their the next he's gone. Her three year old son Ben is missing. The search lengthens and lengthens. But Beth still believes that he is alvive years pass. She wastes away her life. Her other children need her desperatley. She is abandoning them. Will she finally realize that she needs to forget it? Will she ever find Ben the little lost boy? Hope seems to be lost but then something remarkable happens!
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Poorly written, rambling, unsympathetic main character. One of the worst books ever........"
4,Realism is hard to take sometimes...,"Like many others, I read this book initially because of the publicity it received via Oprah. I wish I could say that I ""enjoyed"" this extrememly well-written novel, but I didn't. It was an absorbing, ""real"" story, almost too ""real"" to enjoy. The story of Beth and her family made me think about the ties that bind a family together, and how easily those ties can dissolve. When I read the reviews by other readers, I was disheartened...it would seem that we are so anethesitized by the ""movie of the week"" with the happy ending coming just before bedtime, that we are unhappy reading a novel that depicted fictional characters' all too real reactions to real horror. The Deep End of the Ocean definitely touched a nerve with me. I would recommend it highly, and will look forward to the authors next book"
1,This Book Just Does Not Click,"You know how you get into the ""rhythm"" of book and you just devour it? This book is so laboring and plodding, that it never clicked for me. The previous poster skipped whole paragraphs, I skipped whole chapters.I think if Oprah recommends a book, it is a pot of gold for the author, but the kiss of death for us readers. Remember how she went on about ""Bridges of Madison County"". That book, was horrible, too.I think Oprah likes books where a woman in the book is having deep feelings about herself and her life, etc. She needs to broaden the topic of her book club!"
2,I skipped whole paragraphs,"This book is okay, but often she jumps from current to a past occurence very frequently. One page, referred to something that had happened three different time periods in her life. Sorta rambling. If this hadn't been on Oprah, I never would have started it....."
2,Not so great!,"This was the first book from Oprah's club that I read and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. Beth was an awful person and I felt nothing but heartache for Vincent, Kerry and Pat. I also agree with the other reviews - the ending was contrived"
1,A good way to get some sleep in the hospital,"I had been on a waiting list at the library for months to get this book. Lo and behold! I came upon an audio cassette I could check out, and thought it would be great to take to the hospital to listen to while recuperating from major surgery. Wrong. I quit after the second cassette, and when I finally got the hardcover read the last few chapters to see what happened. The whole thing from literary style to character development was unbelievable. I could not develop any sympathy with any character, especially the hysterical, obsessed mother who showed no genuine affection for any of her children"
1,BORING,I was so glad to read the reviews of other people that didn't like this book. I thought I was the only one. Beth was so self centered and self absorbed that she couldn't see that anyone else was suffering. I decided I really didn't like her when she was so cold toward her only son Vincent. He wanted her attention so much. She wasn't a good mother and she was also a lousy wife. I had a very hard time getting through this book and at the end I wondered why I bothered
5,I don't know,"I am up to about a 100 pages (I bought it this morning) and I have had the ending ruined for me but I'll still keep on reading because it is a fantastic book.By the way, isn't Michelle Pfeiffer supposed to be staring in a movie version of it?"
1,This book isn't worth anyone's time.,"How can anyone read such an infitile book. The only plot there is, was the insanity of the mother. The rest of the book was basically a mumbled mess, which seemed to be thrown together in minutes. My neighbor had recommended me this book. She has three kids, one of which is three. She said that she would never go off ""the deep end"" because she would still have the responsibility of her other two children. I don't see where Ms. Mitchard came up with this idea nor do I care. This book is not only confusing, but it has little or basically no plot. I work at the local library, and not once have I recommended this book to anyone. I have told people not to read it however."
3,Readable but not great,"How come the professional reviewers are in such a hurry to call a book a masterpiece? This book is well written. By that I mean the writing is grammatical and not clunky, but it isn't beautifully written. Try reading E.M. Forster, D.H . Lawrence or Margaret Atwood for really expert writing, plotting etc. Mitchard's characters never change or grow and aren't likable. I can't figure out why I kept reading except to find out what happened to Ben (nothing much). Oh well. At least I didn't buy it. I took it out of the library."
3,"Patience, a must","All I wanted was to know what happened to Ben. Once I found out that he had been living practically next door for years, I could have easily put the book down. Then I kept reading ad discovered I wanted Ben to go back to his ""father"" Frank. But, honestly I could have put it down anytime. Not a very good sign"
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Although I found the beginning of the book extremely interesting and disturbing, it became rambling and dull. The plot is ridiculous and I found myself skipping pages to get to the end. Don't waste your time"
2,"A sad, heavy book with no ending","I can't remember the last time I read a book whose main character I disliked more than I disliked Beth. I couldn't quite decide if her emotional paralysis was caused by the loss of her child - one of three who saw little affection from her - or by her ""poor me"" syndrome. I was compelled to read on because I really wanted to know what happened to Ben, but when I found out, I felt cheated. Oh yeah, right. This was totally missed by the police for nine years. And the second red shoe - a little much. Now about that ending? Um, did the author forget to write it, or did she get bored with this book, too? All in all, an unsatisfying, unsettling book"
2,BEN WAS THE LUCKY ONE,"Ben was the lucky one to have been kidnapped from this weird and dysfunctional family. Beth was a terrible, selfish mother before and after the kidnapping and she didn't grow or evolve at all. Pat was a martyr. Kerry and Vincent were cruelly neglected. The only lucky one in this depressing book was Ben who ended up being the only one who had a good life."
4,A realistic look at what might happen if you lost a child,"I read this book on a recommendation from a fellow book lover. Parts of the book were definitely slow, but I felt throughout the book that I was reading an actual account of a family who lost a son/brother. Beth is not a likeable character, but that is part of what makes this book real -- people don't always ""behave"" as others would like. The affects on each character were very different, and so you become involved in each character individually. Overall, this was a very thought provoking novel!!"
2,"Good title, but a very bad book","I picked up this book because I was so intrigued by the title. It held such weight, I thought the book might have real depth and substance. Unfortunately, I was wrong.I despised Beth and her constant whining and selfishness. I was intrigued by Vincent, but wished his character had been developed beyond the stereotypical guilt-ridden ""survivor"" of a tragedy. The story-line amounted to nothing and kept going on and on in it's tedious rut. I continued reading the book in the hope that eventually someone in the book would wake up out of their stuper and do something memorable or notable or even just outrageous. Nobody ever did."
4,I liked it.,"I'm always amazed at how disparate all these reader reviews are. For the most part, I really liked this book. It was incredibly depressing for most of the novel and I suppose that really isn't great for reviews; however, though I've never lost a child, I can't imagine the experience could be any less painful and horrendous for a family than was depicted here. Beth's not very likeable because there really isn't much left of her after her child disappears. Though a few of the characters were a little over the top (Candy Bliss, Nick what's-his-name) I liked the story. I thought the ending was hopeful. The book had emotion, mystery, humor, struggle, plot, various points of view, a different premise, interesting resolution. I definitely think it's worth reading if you like to read. I laughed. I cried. I give it an 8."
4,a cherished read for any mother,"I found this book enthralling, unable to put it down. I find that alot of people dislike the Beth character. I found her very real, honest, and completely true to life. I have a 3 year old, and two other children. Personally how else would one react. The book was heart warming and emotionally draining at times, but also joyful and wistful. If you read only a few books a year I would truly recommend this be one of them. Your heart and mind will thank you, and you will read it more than once. enjoy....but have your kleenex ready......."
2,VERY POOR WRITING,"I read this book because of all the movie hype. Usually the books are better than the movies - but in this case I sure hope the movie is better!!! I'm not sure I will even waste my time renting it. The writing was very choppy. Many sentences were not proper English. I can't believe this is a bestseller, much less one of Oprah's book club choices. This is the one and only book I will ever read by this author. I was so disappointed."
2,B O R I N G,"Too wordy and detailed, dragged on and on. The story picked up just as I was starting to think about giving up on this book, only to fall flat again. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,SPOILER ALERT,"I took up this book years ago, after reading many positive reviews and hearing so many people talking about it. What a waste of time! The main character was totally unlikeable, for many reasons. No. 1 was leaving a very young child in charge of an even younger one, then not acknowledging (as I recall) her own irresponsibility. Instead, taking it out on other family members. Her husband should have taken the other 2 children and left her. They all would have been less screwed up. And then, years later, the missing child just shows up on her doorstep?! How realistic is that?! Plus the writer is just not that good, even though she's apparently had a lot of success with this and other books.Don't waste your time!"
2,Postscript,"One last note: Vincent, the teenaged son, is really quite ridiculous. He is JUST the ""typical"" teenager. In other words, that stereotype of a teenager: overwhelmingly shallow, egotistical, and childish. Vincent's speech as Mitchard writes it is merely an extension of that stereotype. The stress Mitchard puts on the fact that Vincent is staying away from (oh no!) swear words, like ""shit,"" is a heavy-handed (and failed) attempt at trying to leave Vincent some scrap of morality. I would last like to express my surprise that so few people feel the same way as I do about this novel. (And no, I do not consider myself a ""discriminating"" reader, turning my nose up at anything not on the best seller's list, not a Nobel Prize winner, and not a classic."
2,Deep End not so deep after all,"The Deep End of the Ocean tries very hard to be a moving portrayal of a family brought together by tragedy but ends up trying too hard to accomplish the feat. The premise is quite good, but much more could have been made of the story. Mitchard's writing style is fluid and easy to read, but the plot deteriorates into the world of talk shows and soap operas by halfway into the novel. In the end, Mitchard seems to not know how to finish up the story, ending up with a conclusion that leaves the reader saying, ""So what?&quot"
5,I thought this book was excellent.,"This book is about a mother of three children, Vincent, Kerry, and Ben. One day at the mall 3 year old ben, the mother's favorite child, gets lost. Days, weeks, months, years go by and even the police officer obsessed with the case gives up. But then, something happens."
5,DON'T BELIEVE THE KNOCKERS,Don't read this book if you must have likeable characters or a mystery. However if you want a writer who understands how people really react in a crisis and who can translate that into believable fiction then this book is for you. She's also a terrific wordsmith. My only gripe is that the publisher gave away too much of the story in the blurb. Trust me -I hated The Horse Whisperer!
1,This book was uncohesive; unsatisfying.,"Was this supposed to be a mystery novel, with clues duly planted? A harlequin romance, with that former lover/classmate thing? And what's with the random Vincent chapters? (Didn't work.) Were Mom and Vincent the only ones with feelings? Regardless, I couldn't feel sympathy for ANY character. Her writing style meandered irrationally, her plot twists were unbelievable (a quick photo shoot for Life Magazine, right.)I wanted to quit after the first 100 pages or so, but hoped it would get better. Take my advice, don't even start reading this book."
1,Oprah Must Have Suffered from Temporary Insanity,"God almighty, what bad writing. I'm not talking about plot or characterization or landscape. I'm talking about sentence structure. Paragraphs. Grammar. The fundamentals. I couldn't find my way through half the sentences, they were so clunky and burdensome. She uses dashes with abandon, and parenthetical clauses that go completely off track. I couldn't get past page 29; it was too painful. Oprah did readers a grave disservice."
1,"Not worthy of the ""rave"" reviews the media has bestowed","There was not a single enduring character in the story. The mother, Beth, infatuated me with her irresponsible attitude towards the rest of the family. The story was extremely choppy and hard to follow. I didn't waste my time finishing the book as I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. I cannot understand what all the fuss was in reguard to this book."
3,Well written book with an unbelieveable plot line.,"It's a shame such a talented writer uses ""dreams"" to lead her in developing plots. The ""twists"" don't make the book; they distract. If I hadn't been reading for a book club I would have never finished it!"
2,ZZZZ....,"Yawn. I just couldn't finish this book. The title is lovely, and the premise is fairly interesting ( a child vanishes.) But Beth Cappadora was one of the most boring characters I've ever met, and halfway through the book I plunked it down in disgust and checked out a collection of African short stories, which were infinitely more interesting and vivid than the travails of this white bread mom."
3,"good story, could have better writing","I didn't think I would enjoy this book primarily since it was recommended by my Mother (and our tastes in fiction are polar opposites) and because it was writtne by a woman (yes I do have chauvinist leanings). I was surprised how strong the author portrayed the father, while providing no sympathy for the Mother. The story is really the reaction Sam (Ben) has in the second half of the novel. Up until then the reader is wallowing in the pain and suffering of the mother and it gets tedious fast. I had to take issue with the writing and editing. Often the reader is pages in a section before you know who the hell is speaking. Overall a good book, but it had the potential to be much better."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I just finished reading this book today, and found that I liked the book as much as I didn't like it. I wish that we could have gone into Ben/Sam's head after he had been found to explore what was going on with him in more depth. I was also dissapointed in the fact that Cecilia had mental problems, so we never really got to find out her side of that story either.At the same time, however, the book really did keep my interest, and I didn't think it was hard to read at all, as some previous readers have said. I guess I just wanted to find out what other bad things could actually happen to this poor family.I would have liked to have known for sure if Beth stayed with Pat after Sam came back, rather than drawing my own conclusions. I just like for all the loose ends to be tied up, I suppose, and this book didn't do that for me."
2,Looks good but the printer doesn't like the taste.,This printer cartridge arrived quickly and looks just like the genuine hp article. Unfortunately the printer wouldn't accept it as a new cartridge. Verbatim tech support was very nice and is sending a new one (as soon as they receive the one we have) but we have to pay the return shipping. I'll update this if the replacement doesn't work either.
1,This printer model does not like non-OEM toner,"This must be a very selective printer. We have tried numerous non-OEM brands of replacement toner, and have had trouble with every one. They have all leaked, leaving a messy machine, and lasted no more than a few weeks at most, with very light and streaky print and blotchy patches where toner has leaked around the drum.The Verbatim is no exception - leaky and short-lasting. Does not save money in the long run, and the I.T. guys hate me. Non-OEM cartridges have been very successful in other HP printers, but for replacement toners for the model 4250/4350 series, spend the extra money and buy OEM replacements."
1,Do NOT Buy this product - bait and switch sales,"The photo shows multi-color tabs, while fine print states clear tabs.They ship just clear tabs, rather than the displayed multi-colored tabs.Avoid hassles, do business elsewhere."
5,maverick the best western.,CANT WAIT FOR THIS SHOW TO BE OUT ON DVD. THIS IS THE BEST WESTERN EVER. HOPE MORE WB WESTERNS LIKE COLT .45 ALSO WILL BE RELEASED SOON.
2,I was really disappointed,"I thought this book would be full of his tips and tricks he uses on TV. I saw Kyan in an interview on the Today show about the book and he gave some ""homemade"" recipes for beauty. SO I thought I would get the book for my mom as a gift. I guess I assumed the book would have similar stuff to what he was interviewed about. I was wrong. I thought the book was very elementary and boring."
3,Not bad...,"The book's nice, short, and sweet, but it doesn't mean it lacks anything! Kyan covers the basics of the basics, what most women forgets when they do a jumpstart on basic health and beauty. This is a great book for beginners, as well as a nice reference + revision for people like me."
5,FINALLY! THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR!,"Finally I have found a beauty book that not only focuses on looks, but the soul and the beauty from within as well! The photos throughout the book are genious and they truly are beautiful images that scream ""Be confident and know that you are beautiful inside and out"". I am so happy that Kyan took the time out of his hectic schedule as a beauty expert and television star to write this incredible book!Thanks Kyan for everything that you have shared with us and thank you again for guiding me in the direction to the journey of ""Beautifying"" my life!"
4,Children's book,"I own this book and live in the area where the barn is located. It is a delightful description of the history for young people in the area. However, it is also a snapshot of the old fashioned way of life. When the pace was slower and the gentle art of milk a cow was passed on from generation to generation.The artwork and story behind the publication of this book are not to be missed."
1,Loses color in two use,"Just after two uses, the shoe showed white patches here and there andlooks ugly now after just two uses - not used in rain yet."
1,Good Book/BAD Shape,"I love the textbook but it is in such bad shape. The entire book has highlights throughout and there are sticky-notes EVERYWHERE! Also, the book is marked-up in just about every empty space. I don't think I will ever buy another used book from Amazon. I was told it was in good shape."
2,Save Your Money,"A typical B+ straight-to-video 'story' we've all seen 100 times before with the Italian Mafia, supposedly in Miami, but obviously made on a Hollywood movie set along with the Hollywood street shots. Oh well. I evidently was up to wasting 1&1/2 hours. Worth about $1.99 on a late Saturday night with beer, pizza & 6 loser dudes. Female chest shots if you're into that."
2,disappointing!,"""you'd prefer an astronaut"" is one of my favorite albums and ""electra 2000"" is very enjoyable...however...this album...grossly disappointing. the lyrics compared to astronaut's clever metaphors are completely uninspired or in fact repeated. out of ten songs only two sound like the band tried. this is an afterthought of an album and i'd say pass on it and go listen to ""you'd prefer an astronaut"". and for the previous reviewers, you completely mislead me into believing this album was worth buying."
5,hum....downward is heavenward,this is a great product!!!I got it very quckly. The service was great!
5,They don't make albums like this anymore,"A sonic (I hate to call it grunge) masterpiece by HUM, a Champaign band that performed their last gig on Dec 31st, 1999. Y2K did them in.This album is on par with their also amazing ""Electra 2000"" CD, but is more refined, intricate, orchestrated, and poetic space rock. My faves are ""Cheetah"", ""Dreamboat"", ""Green"", and ""Scientists"", but the whole album is very strong and varies nicely in tone and tempo. Buy it, love it.Lovers of HUM can find a strong follow-on work by a band called ""Centaur"", which features the lead-singer, song-writer, guitarist of HUM, Matt Talbott."
5,Best band of all time,"As anyone that listens to Hum knows, they create the most enjoyable music. This album like all their others is absolutley perfect. Rocks, yet beautiful and meaningful. Hum are hear for good!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,It doesnt seem like we are alone are we?,"having owned this on cassette i feel compelled to leave a review for a dead format.after loving it hard core and actually springing for a cd player in my POS car i was driving back in '98, i was left with this gem on tape.it was weird and i just remember i used to listen to it on a boombox before going to sleep and waking up to it the next day playing backwards! i kid you not this actually happened twice.i think it got screwed up in the tape player that could change sides of the tape automaticly. ANYWAY! i gave that tape away after it corrected itself but i kept the cover and case to it because it had a bonus pic of the Magic Masters known as Hum playing vairous Gibson and space machine equipment that the Cd didnt have but who knew since i got this first so heres to great bands on tape!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!5 stars! easily!"
5,"""Master of Puppets"" for the '90's","I have listened to thousands of CD's, and until I heard this album, ""Master of Puppets""by Metallica was my only 5-star album and the benchmark by which all other albums are judged. This is easily the best record since ""Master"". I feel very fortunate to have seen HUM perform live at the CD release party for this album. I still dream about it. If you like the textures of the Cure, the cerebralness of Pink Floyd, the musical complexity & heaviness of early Metallica, and the brutal sincerity of The Smiths, buy this immediately. Someday, people will look back and wonder how in the world they missed this album. Funny, the same thing happened to ""Master of Puppets""."
2,"Whoa, talk about a bad change of direction.","I hate to slam them, but Hum really let me down with this album. After listening to You'd Prefer an Astrounaout for so long, I was thrilled to hear some new material from the band. After several attempts of trying to get into the noise I found coming off this album, I eventually just gave up and put the damn thing away. I don't understand how such a good band could take such a drastic turn towards the worse in-between the span of one album. Downward is Heavenward is a big, slapped together mesh of static and sloppy guitar work. It's characteristic of something you'd here from Sonic Youth(ugh). After reading some of these reviews, I'm glad to see some people liked it. Maybee the band will stick around long enough to make something that hits my intrest again."
2,Ho-hum,"2 1/2Second-tier, first generation alternative band never was able to dig their way out of the generically noisy rut they carved out for themselves, though constant attempts, with some success, to contrast the choking distortion with more subtle and softer strumming keeps things moving along without too much apathy."
2,A big Disappointment,"""Downward Is Heavenward"" was one of the few albums I had looked forward to, probably due to the fact that YPAA is a brilliant record. Unfortunately, Hum seemed to have run out of ideas, choosing to instead spin their musical wheels in songs like ""Dreamboat"", ""Afternoon with the Axolotls"" and ""The Inuit Promise"". All three of these songs showcase the main annoying thing about Hum: plodding brevity without any energy. Not to say that the album is all bad, as ""Comin' Home"" and ""Ms. Lazarus"" capture the feel of their earlier albums, while ""If You Are To Bloom"" and ""The Scientists"" show the band's sensitive (?!) side. All in all, a disappointment"
5,super relaxing massage cushion,This massage chair cushion absolutely melts away the stress as soon as you turn it on. An excellent purchase!!
3,Car Use Back Massager,Expected a 10 motor massager - got the 5 motor one. It works fine. Give some time to get use to it...I gave it as a gift; reciever seems happy with it.
5,Surprisingly Great AND Cheap!,"For $20 I really expected a complete piece of junk. The three separate motorized sections are pretty strong. I have no idea how they make this product and still make a profit off of $20, but I am impressed!4 stars for being such a great working product and a 5th star for the amazing price!"
4,Great car massager seat.,Some seats are for home but this one we use for the car. It's straps allow you to hook it right to the car seat.this one won't have heat pads in it but the massage seat has more comfort in the padding and the vibrations are controllable.It won't add rollers or pressure motions for you but it will relax you.
4,Old School Death Metal,"When I first listened to this album, I really found it had a good Death Metal structure. The drums were amazing, the guitar and bass were also very noticible, the vocals had a great Death Metal Twist. The things I disliked, almost every song sounded the same. The vocals didn't seem to fit with some of the guitar riffs, and it also really sounds like Sepultura's Beneath The Remains, almost copying it at some points... But contrary to all this, of course it was the beginning of Death Metal. So If you like Old School Death Metal like Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, or even Sepultura... You should consider having Skeletal Earth in your collection."
2,A big mess,"I was excited when I got the CD, and what I listened is now on an empty shelf. No energy, no metal at all. Try at your own risk!"
2,Not sure what to make of this,"It's nice to have a DVD of Beethoven's late workson piano on this CD. Unfortunately Piotr playingleave something to be desired. Maybe it's just toorelaxed, and somehow lacks the intensity and urgencywhich characterized much of B's late works. Alsothere seems to be too much use of pedal.The diabelli varations is very rhythimically complexand I don't think he executed it too well."
3,You can't judge a book by its cover.,"""You can't judge a book by its cover."" Truer words have not been written when it comes to ""Let's Go Austria & Switzerland - including Prague, Budapest, Munich 2000"".A lot of info on Austria and Switzerland but Prague, Budapest and Munich aren't to be found in this guide!"
3,The beginning of it all,"Take a trip a decade backwards and The Gathering resembled little of what they are today. Back in those days they were playing a kind of keyboard laced doom-metal with male death vocals and occasional female ones (Gathering were also one of the pioneers of this tyle) . This album is probably loathed by fans of the bands more recent albums and revered by some doom/death fans. I rest in the middle - The album is good in some parts and cool in a way. It still has that mystical Gathering atmosphere, but at the same time it never raises itself to the great plains of their future albums. I like to think of this album as the creation of things: A young world that has never known daylight.Recommended for Doom-metal fans and for anyone who is interested in the history of this amazing band."
4,You won't believe this is The Gathering,"This is back in the day when they had low, death vocals. It's amazing how much they have changed from then 'til now. It's a really interesting album; nothing else quite like it for sure. New fans probably won't like it. No, actually I'm quite sure they won't like. But it's still good."
2,Their worst album,This their worst album. The production is terrible and the male vocals are awful compare to the future female vocals. This album reminds me Paradise lost in their beginning . Nothing special not even average.
2,You could NEVER mistake this for real Jane Austen!,"I will admit that the mystery plot of this novel was ratherengaging, in the same line as a Dorothy Sayers perhaps. However, thecutseyness and derivative writing style so annoyed me that I had trouble finishing the book. For those who are real afficianados of Jane Austen and her work, this work is only the palest of camparisons. I could not detect any of the sparkling wit and very little of the sharp social commentary for which the real Austen is well-known. The mystery itself, while clever enough, is sometimes so farfetched that suspension of disbelief is impossible. In general, I found this book to be quite a disappointment. I think I'll stick to Jane, herself, from now on."
2,"Somehow, this seems mighty familiar . . .","Nice try, but a re-hash of the Darcy/Wickham story in a mystery setting is rather boring. In addition, Mrs. Austen is obviously modeled on Mrs. Bennet. Also, the author works a little too hard at trying to sound like Jane Austen. The style tends to take the spotlight rather than the story line. (This is understandable, as the story line is mighty thin). Unless you're desperate for the mention of Jane Austen's name, I wouldn't bother with it."
4,Rip-snorter of an ending,"I've just finished ""Man of the Cloth"" and am eager to start the next in the series. Or maybe I'll TAKE A BREAK, go back to Donna Leon and/or P.D. James for a while and stretch out my enjoyment of the Jane Austen Mysteries.I agree with other reviewers that the story is slow to start but, wow, is the ending worthy of, say, Robert Louis Stevenson! ""Man of the Cloth"" isn't so much of a mystery as an adventure story. Jane's efforts as a detective are, perhaps, a bit peripheral to the story. But once it gets going, it's a page turner.On a minor matter, there seemed to be fewer lines from the Austen novels on display. In particular, I just peeked at the first page of ""Wandering Eye"" and was delighted to see that, finally, Barron abandons ""It is a truth universally acknowledged as an opening line.Overall, Barron puts her grasp of Austen's writing style to good use. ""Man of the Cloth is a very enjoyable read."
4,Another Fun Read from Stephanie Barron,"Having really enjoyed the first and third books in this series, I did groan when this installment began with scenes that seemed shamelessly stolen from Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, but Barron's plotting and intriguing characters quickly won me over. These novels are meant for light reading; readers who really know Austen's works and the time period well will catch Ms. Barron in some errors, but these do not spoil the fun of the adventures or the attempts to figure out ""who done it"" before our heroine does. I actually laughed aloud with delight when I reached this novel's climax! Overall, I think this installment is the best of the three I have read so far. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and I think most fans of Austen and mystery novels will certainly enjoy them."
3,It could be a lot better in certain parts !,"It is a good book but it could be a lot better if they had woorked a litle more over it. It has some inacurate pictures,in one of then they say a soldier is using a german machine gun while it is a Belgium design that in the States is named M240. Also the chapter about Delta and the Rangers is very old, old pictures old text and old weapons,they should have updated it and put some more pictures. The good part is that it has great stories about real missions and it has good details on weapons,military aircraft and other stuff.The chapter about the Seals is medium,some nice pictures and some nice text. In global its a book that an expert would find very poor in actualization and pictures but that a normal person would find very interesting. Good readings to you all."
2,Not the Best,"This book had dates all wrong as well as grammatical errors. I refused to buy it for those reasons. There are better, more accurate, and certainly more informative books on special ops forces."
5,Best micro nutrient in the market for me,"I like Seachem products for the planted aquaria, and I currently use their nitrogen, phosphate and potassium macro additives in addition to their Flourish micro nutrient product. All products work as advertised without adverse effect, I have many shrimp and other delicate fish in the tanks that are dosed with the above products.For large tanks or long term use however you can't beat dry ferts and I will be moving to those soon for n-p-k at the very least.Farhad"
4,I like it,"If you have plants in your aquarium, this is a must. So far this is the best I've tried. Use this to insure your plants get enough nourishment to stay healthy."
3,...,Been using this product with the seachem flourish excel for a few weeks now but don't really notice a big change in my plants. This product was poorly packaged and one of the bottle was leaking when I opened it. I sent pictures to amazon and they didnt do anything about so be aware of this when your buying.
5,"Works fine, but needs to be dosed carefully.","Our aquarium plants are noticeably more vibrant after treating with Flourish after a couple weeks, and that's using a less than recommended dose to be extra cautious with our ghost shrimp. Has a very strong metallic smell and likely stains, so take care not to spill it or get much on your hands."
3,Alright,"I don't know if it's actually working because I don;t have a schedule for dosing. It says ""do not overdose"" and yes.... DO NOT OVERDOSE. I would recommend using less of the amount it says to use. i put a capful of it into my 10gallong. I wake up the next day and the water was super cloudy (it was crystal clear the day I added in). According to google, it is because of bacteria boom. It goes away after a water change though. No fish is affected."
4,Great for the self-learner and practice sessions...,"This book is very good for getting up to speed in algebra. If you have not taken algebra in a while, this book will help you in evaluating your progress. An important feature is that sample solutions are explained in incremental steps. The explanations pertain more to technique than to the theory behind the problems. I first brush up on a topic in a general algebra text and then use this book to reinforce the concepts. Another benefit of this book is that solving problem after problem gives one a sense of accomplishment that may get side-tracked in other textbooks."
2,despair,after examining this solver have come to the conclusion that turkish math solvers for college students are more helpful and comprehensive.Therefore I advise college students of the world to find these books on Turkish on-line booksellers.
2,Pick and choose in this one,"Robitaille says some interesting and funny things, but in general I found his book hard going. The prose is quite dense (this may be the fault of the translation), and the author expects his readers to be as au courant with the details of French political and social life of the last twenty years as he is. If you're not up to speed, you'll be left scratching your head about the significance of this strike and that strike, this gaffe and that gaucherie, this change of minister and that, and on and on. But there are some very entertaining general articles in this collection, so I recommend that the Average Reader (in this case, someone generally but not intimately familiar with matters French) hunt them out and enjoy them, and leave the rest to the specialists."
2,Amusing at times but could have contributed more insights,"For well over thirty years, I have been visiting France for a minimum of one month per year, and feel very fortunate to have many French friends.While I found the beginning of the book most amusing, I did not appreciate the ""puff"" pieces. I wish, after his having spent twenty years in France, M. Robitaille would have given us his insights as to why the French still do not buy automobiles with automatic transmission, or why General De Gaulle was never promoted to Marshall of France, or the contribution McDo (McDonald's) has made to France, or why Disneyland Paris is now a success, or consider that M. Mitterand did actually have a lovely apartment where he lived with two others, or why Jean Moulin continues to be honored, etc., etc."
5,Not A Place To Save,"The PSU has always been a place to cut cost on every box I've ever built. What I've learned is this is not the area to save money EVER! This PSU is quality made, and has ALL modular connectors, in this case enough for quad SLI (multiple PCIe graphics cards). Cooler Master DOES make an 850W for a dual SLI, and it's a bit less expensive, but I went overkill just in case."
5,Finest book on economics from the last half of the 20th century,The finest book on economics from the last half of the 20th century. No one should claim they understand capitalism if they can't address the fundamental points of this book. It shows Why Labor Matters--and how suppressing the social and political power of labor makes the system work.
3,Eastern N.A. Shorebirds,There are some nice bits of video in this DVD offering. Newer birders will learn quite a bit from it. But it does not match up to the very best DVD products aimed at the burgeoning market for birders who want to learn how to identify birds in the field. I was annoyed by the fact that the quiz on this DVD showed birds that had not been descibed in the main portion of the video. No fair!
2,way too much technical charting from ancient charts/graphs,"half of the book is pictures of charts, and brief (paragraphs) descriptions of what happened to make the chart move, mostly it deals in commodities, and deals with the stock market from the early 90s, as we all know in the stock market, one year is like 10, so this is mostly outdated, i was very dissapointed with this book."
1,disappointing,"the title was intriguing, but it was downhill from there. the book had little to do with the title, which always makes me question the motives of the author. is there some message they are aching to express, or are they looking to simply enrich themselves?"
2,Depending on the reader...,"I bought this anthology when I was really into performing, and watching performance poetry, SLAM, spoken word, whatever you want to call it. Even then I was disappointed. Perhaps I'm an elitist then, but I would have much rather this was a DVD, or a few CDs perhaps, but this work is meant to be performed, and on the page it just doesn't, well, perform, which is why, since my last move it hasn't made its way onto the bookshelf."
5,Poetry Bible,This has got to be the best anthology around.So many different styles of poetry. It has become my favorite book in my entire collection. I have given this book to freinds who swear they hate poetry and have changed their whole outlook on the art.I first read this 4 years ago and it inspired me to pick up my pen (after not writing for almost ten years) and make my voice heard
4,Great New Unusual Recipies,This has some really great new and different recipies that you've got to try out. The author gotthese in her trips to Latin America like Brazil and Argentina etc.
4,nice jewelery,"I'd been searching for these - I bought a pair at an art show years ago & they broke. They're larger than I would have liked, but very nice. I have gotten used to the size. 2"" on a ruler looks smaller than these do on your ear. Very well made - should last for a long time (some silver is too soft & the posts break). Overall, I'm glad to have them."
3,Circa 1970's,"This video is an excellent pictoral guide to England...circa 1970-something! The video is entertaining, though a bit dry, and centers mainly around historical and scenic sites. There is nothing about modern London or modern life in England. The clothing and grain of the video give it away. What it does show is beautiful and interesting, no doubt, but alot can change in 30 years. Problem is, you wouldn't know it by watching this dvd."
4,GOOD CD,"I think my sister had the cassette tape and it broke so I had to buy the album. As I listen to the cd now it doesn't move me as much as it did back in the day because I feel like he was trying to hard and straining his voice but thats just me.However I did give him 4 stars so that I dont take away from his ability to sing great r&b; songs.I guess if so many groups and single artist didnt come out and ruin it sounding the same, I would think this is still a great cd.I must keep it real. I read all of the reviews on here and one person said that it was the GREATEST ALBUM.UM NAH.Rome has some good songs on here but I wouldn't dear give it 5 stars."
5,1st Time Buyer,"This was my first order with Amazon. I was glad that you can view the ratings of the buyers prior to placing your order. That way, you have some level of confidence in your purchase. I received it well before the shipping expiration and it looks completely new. They took great care of the product considering its age. I will definitely purchase again!"
4,It is a great little toolbox!,"It holds all the tools I need for tasks around the house. Saving a lot of steps to the shop. It is an open bin with about 4 inches of space below the tray. The tray has about the same clearance to the top. The two snap boxes have six compartments each for fasteners and small parts. They snap securely into the top of the box. The handle folds down to provide a slat surface for stacking.If I had any complaint it would be about the feel of the latches. They do close and, so far, they stay closed. BUT they don't 'snap' like most latches. So they don't give me the FEELING of being securely closed.In time I can judge if they stay closed.It is certainly a good value. It is serviceable. It is sturdy, thick plastic and thus waterproof from the bottom."
4,Nice toobox!,Minus 1 star for 1 missing parts organizer on the cover. I don't think it is worth it to RMA this for the missing organizer. Other than that it is exactly what I wanted and built with rugged plastic that will not rust. I would recommend this as well as recommending Plano to double check shipments :).
4,Will surprise you.,I did not expect this box to be as nice as it is. It surprised me how durable it is and how much stuff it will hold. I love the little plastic organizers on top and they stay in place real good. I'm glad I didn't buy a large standing chest like I intended to. I like being able to transport my tools easily and this box makes that possible.
5,Awesome lil tool box.,"I bought this to hold a few tools around the house. It locks well. My two and half year old can't open it. This is where all our nails, screws, and tacks are held."
1,Doesn't fit camera!,"Someone seemingly just packaged parts with no instructions. It is supposed to fit over the lens via tubes attached to the camera body, which are threaded wrong. The whole thing becomes a ""Rube Goldbergian"" half-measure. You'd be better-off to tape it to a lens holder or just use step-up rings. I should have returned it, but kept it as a punishment for trying to employ half-measures. BTW: Other than a light AR, I don't see anything ""High Def"" about the optics."
2,Dumbed down,"I've used this book in the classroom, mainly because it was one of the only texts available on cnf. However, I really dislike this book for its dumbed-down approach. Whazzup with that, Phil? Most of your audience for this book would be those in an academic setting...so why not write with some real insight? You manage to make this fascinating genre sound dull and stodgy...middle-agey...ZZZZzzzzZZZzzz...The problem with cnf, in general, is that so few good texts are available for those who teach creative writing. Even the AWP book with co-editors Carolyn Forche and good old Philip Gerard is second rate. It doesn't have NEARLY enough essays on the how-to's of writing cnf, and includes some cnf essays that are wildly inappropriate, as if the editors had to flesh out the volume and just crammed some stuff in at the last minute. If someone doesn't compile a better cnf textbook, I'm gonna have to do it myself. :-("
5,a great sequel to Malcolm,"I loved Malcolm (the original MacDonald, not the modernized Phillips version) and was delighted to see there was a sequel--a very satisfying sequel."
5,No Issues,I found an old depth/fish finder in a bass boat I bought but it didn't have a power cable -- checked Humminbird and they had the power cable but Amazon beat their price considerably. By the way the old fish finder works like a charm!
2,Humminbird 7200021 PC 10 10-Foot Power Cable,"Be careful. Model Number says PC 10 10-Foot power cable. Got package and it says it is a 6 foot cable, same thing that comes in the box with the Hummingbird GPS/Fishfinder unit."
3,"Bitter, bitter, bitter","It's a bitter book written by a bitter man. I suppose it's funny. There are some great one-liners in it, but mostly the book just drones on and on. Frankly I hated it, but my partner found it to be a laugh riot. You choose."
2,He's no David Sedaris,"While the situations in Ford's chapters are somewhat amusing, his writing style is so unclever and dull that the way-too-frequent comparisons to David Sedaris are unjustified and a slight to our favorite queer ex-pat. The book bogs down early and is damn near impossible to finish.Don't take my word for it; click on the ""read an excerpt"" tag to the left. As a previous reviewer noted, it makes the scriptwriting of ""Ellen"" look brilliant and hilarious."
1,A Big Yawn,"This book was a major disappointment. The humor never really rises above the level of your average sitcom. Readers who thought that ""Ellen"" was, like, really really funny will probably enjoy this. But even the title is stale, echoing as it does early 1990's Dan Savage.Here's hoping the next century marks a resurgence of wit."
1,Good luck getting it in the air !!!,"1.) First, you will need to CUSTOMIZE te landing gear (front and rear), since the ones included are useless - they don't spin; and prevent take-offs and cause crashes on landing. Build new wheels of GREATER DIAMETER, that spin freely.2.)Second, it is grossly UNDER-POWERED. Take-offs can be difficult (impossible in even a slight breeze). New wheels for landing gear will help, but tough to keep propellers from hitting nose first.3.) Despite instructions, NEVER throw aircraft into the air to get it flying - it will ALWAYS crash!! (The person who wrote the instructions obviously speaks very poor English and NEVER flew this plane!!!)My advice: Buy a heavier, GAS-POWERED plane with remote-control instead."
1,Don't buy!!!!!,"Awful!!!!!!!!!! I needed this for a prop. When I received it, the leather was torn, and it was very flimsy!!! I bought a different riding crop from elsewhere for the same price, and it was 100% better!!! Don't purchase this garbage; even if it is just a prop. Giving this crop one star is much too generous."
1,GARBAGE!!,"I would have to completely review with everyone who reviewed this product except for ""WHIP IT GOOD."" Didn't even get a chance to use it properly before the tip broke. It arrived with cracked leather and missing paint, very cheap not worth even the five bucks it's listed at."
3,Whip it!,"I didn't expect much for the price and the quality seems in line with the cost. The crop is extremely flexible which gives it a lot of wiggle and play - not great for the novice player who is likely to be tempted by the price. And I suspect it wouldn't hold up well to the heavy use of a regular player, but haven't tested it to that extent to date.On the upside, it has a nice surprisingly sharp sting. Just be sure to test it out before use, use a light hand until you get a feel for it and don't expect it to last too long."
2,cheap material,this product started to fall apart after only a few swings. After a week of use the tip fell off. It would be fine for one time bedroom play but nothing else.
1,Awful!,"I really should have read the reviews before purchasing. ""Genuine Leather Riding Crop Whip"" does not imply ""flimsy faux leather strip braided around cardboard."" DO NOT PURCHASE FOR BDSM USE. If you're looking for a costume accessory, this is for you. Horrible purchase on my part."
1,MORE PISSED,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. I ordered a riding crop and instead received what looks to be a miniature cat o nine, WHAT NERVE!!!! Totally different from what is in the picture. Thats what I get for not reading the reviews. I would give it no stars if I could."
4,Exactly as advertised!,"Oh happy day!! I received my order just as advertised. The product is sturdy, yet light weight...Appears hand made, yet durable."
1,Meh,"Flimsy. Good handle, but the leather is rough, and not the good kind. The tip is sad and weak and well...limp.It's not exactly the most visually pleasing one either. The loop at the end feels like it would give out in a second."
4,Come Back to get some Toxic Voodoo,"""Toxic Voodoo"" has been unjustly criticized and merits more attention from the metal public. Granted, it's more of a Dawn Crosby solo project than a real Fear of God album and it came on the heels of the brilliant ""Within The Veil"" that would be nearly impossible to match. But, ""Toxic Voodoo"" is an interesting mélange of death, thrash and doom metal with Dawn's unique tortured vocals and stays interesting throughout it's duration. There is groove aplenty and heaviness that could challenge the likes of Slayer and Testament."
2,Extremely disappointing follow up,"I loved Fear of God's debut record and had the chance to see them on that tour in St. Pete Florida. Never really followed up though but when I was record shopping on line a few weeks ago ""Toxic Voodoo"" popped up as a recommendation. I promptly ordered it with anticipation. Man, what a disappointment. The songs are just straight forward middle of the road thrash/speed metal. Nothing original or unique. The production didn't have that dark, atmospheric, end-of-days sound that was such a large part of the appeal of the first record. I listened to it a few times to see if it would grow on me but ultimately stuck it back in it's case and popped the debut in for a couple more listens. Dawn Crosby had a momentary convergence with the right guys to make a great heavy record but was unable to sustain it. It's a shame. RIP"
3,Fear of God,"R.I.P. Dawn Crosby!!! I really liked the first CD from them, but this one isn't bad. I just preferred the debut CD."
5,"Blue Suede Shoes, A Ballet",Blue Suede ShoesI saw this on PBS a while back! I was happy to find this CD. Most original ballet and superb Bob Mackie sets and costumes and of course ELVIS!!!Pure enjoyment!
2,Thunder at Dawn,"The book was poorly written, certainly not up to Jill Gregory's caliber of writing. I was very disappointed and will want to preview any future books before purchasing. I have read several other books written by her and found the writing to be more believable and the characters better developed."
5,Brought the true meaning of Christmas to life for our family,"We have two kids, 2 and 4. We used this devotional and some homemade ornaments on a small tree each morning leading up to Christmas and my boys couldn't get enough. They made sure we didn't forget to read and the follow-up questions in the book were great conversation starters."
4,Adaptable and Timely,Having devotions appropriate for children separate from those for adults is advantageous for families and children's groups. The devotions are timely and on target as well as easily adaptable.
3,"Good material, poorly bound","I just bought this at the end of November. It serves its purpose for the Jesse Tree Advent fairly well, though I would have preferred a different Bible translation than KJV, I think. But that isn't my biggest problem with it. I think it does a good job with the verses, questions, and narration. The problem is that it is very poorly bound, I opened it once to look through it. The next time I opened it, it split down the binding. It will probably not last for two Christmases. Better, I guess, to use the free material from A Holy Experience."
5,Great used with ornaments!!,"Each year a group of ladies (25) gets together and picks a day's devotional and makes an ornament to go along with that day. Each person makes 25 of their ornament and then everyone gets together and exchanges. Finally, you have a complete set that you can use along with this great devotional book!! Each day has a devotion/symbol and there are readings for children and adults. My children unwrap the ornament for the day and then we read the devotional. It makes a wonderful family time!!"
5,Great for Kids!,"We've only used this for one Advent so far, but I loved it! The people who wrote it really seem to understand how to talk to small children, unlike some other things that I've used even though they were written specifically for children. I think it's great for adults, too. It's clear, to the point, and enjoyable to read. Exactly what we needed for our family that's made up of two very tired and distracted parents and four small kids."
5,Great book for the whole family,"My family is really enjoying this book. Each daily devotion is short with scripture reading from the old and new testaments. Short discussions about the scripture and a prayer. For the ornaments I have just been photocopying the picture for each day, having one of my children decorate it and at the end of the devotion they hang it on the lighted greenery on the stairwell. All of us look forward to this time together each evening as the story unfolds to the birth of Jesus. I highly recommend this book."
3,Good Start,"This is a very interesting and neglected subject for a book. I'm interested in anything about bicycling and a bit about the turn of the century, so this was a must-read. Because this is the only book of it's kind I've found, I would recommend reading it.However, be aware of a few annoyances. The book is poorly edited and proof-read. There are many hyphens separating words that are not at the ends of lines, and a few paragraphs end mid-sentence. There are quite a few repeated passages and it tends to wander a bit from the main subject. One gets the feeling it would not have filled a book of more normal format and was padded a bit. It would be nice to see this one re-published and improved.Again, I don't mean to disparage it too much - just pointing out some personal annoyances.Hope it helps..."
5,Nina Simone Live at Town Hall CD,"This CD I was lucky to find as years ago I had the LP, and now I can enjoy it on disc. It's a classic and one I'm glad to have found!"
5,Beautiful,"The always excellent Nina, who is often at her best live, really shines on this MP3 version of the album. As usual her piano playing shines through along with her strong, beautiful vocals. Her second album for Colpix Records, it was recorded live at The Town Hall in New York City on September 15, 1959 with some songs re-recorded at the studio a month later. Sit back, listen, relax, and enjoy!Two notes for Amazon: 1) Track 5 is incorrectly labeled as ""I Don't Want Him (Anymore)"". The song is actually titled ""You Can Have Him"". 2) The cover art is awful! It's probably a copyright issue but the original LP cover is preferred."
3,Love Nina,The cd arrived on time and in good condition. We love Nina. The recordings have poor sound quality and need to be turned way up just to hear them. This makes it difficult when other cds accidently also play at this volume.
3,Not bad for the price.,"Genetic Wisdom play a sort of metallic hardcore (not sure if you could call it metalcore)with heavy use of syncopated drum/guitar riffs ala Fear Factory. Fans of early Prong or Helmet would find good value here. By no means a must have, but the perfect candidate for budget shoppers looking to add depth to their collections."
3,Their Best is disappointing,"I have listened to a few of their tracks before buying this cd and it was from their newish albums called my religion. I have to say the new material is much better their old, because it has better production, more orginality in terms of melodies and use of instruments. This Cd has the same elements from every single 80s metal band, and the use of lyrics is as korny as ever, with the same wordings, heaven, hell, swords and fighting...take it from a true metal fan, this is not worth buying. recommend their new cds instead"
2,Heavier - Lots of Clanky sound!,"The Chips probably have Metal Clanks inside, too heavy - not ideal for playing at home!"
3,Expectations were too high after reading other reviews,"I ordered these because of all the positive reviews noting high quality poker chips... I was disappointed.Chips contain little to no clay at all.If you're a hardcore poker fanatic like me and require quality casino-like chips, this set is NOT for you.I ordered these a long time ago and did not do enough research.However, this chip set is great for the casual player.Case is nice and sturdy. Should last a very long time.Also I don't know why the list price is $130. I see this set being sold everywhere for the same $40 price tag."
4,A worthy sequal,"Have you ever listened to an advertisement, politician, or pundit and wondered, ""Is that even a word?"" English is an ever-evolving language, however, like organic evolution, some things just don't work. Ken Smith eagerly points out these detrimental mutations of the English language. While the book is a pleasurable and informative read, Mr. Smith can be a bit pretentious and politically biased with his examples."
3,Lost the cutting edge,"With the release of their first album ""On"" in 1979. Off Broadway has a distinct style and enthusiasm that spread through the music. The ""Fallin' In"" release lacks the drive and energy of ""On"" and ""Quick Turns"". Unfortunately, they just seems old."
1,Off BROADWAY WASHED UP,"Sadly Off Broadway is washed up...When Cliff Johnson pulled the rip cord the band went ""poof"".... inconsistent backup stage musician types..lack color character and talent. pure second rate fluff! Don't bother you can see the weashed up band at local bars, street fairs and festivals. don't waste your money!"
2,A disappointing comeback,"I was very excited to see that Off Broadway had a new album out-about 17 years after their last one.And to top that off, they now have Mimi Betinis from the shoulda-been legendary Pezband. Unfortunately, the songs are just not there in my opinion. The production is superb, and the band sound tight and powerful, but....here's hoping they re-release Quick Turns as a stop-gap and concentrate on writing some great pop songs for their next real comeback album."
5,A Great Camera,"I bought this camera because my old one broke. Everywhere I go I like to take pictures as kind of like a souvenir, and I bought this camera for a recent trip. It worked perfectly. The directions in the manual were quite simple and got to taking pictures before I knew it. The size, easiness, and weight make it very convienent. I was amazed at it's toughness for such a small camera. It's also a great camera for someone who is just beginning and knows little about pictures. Highly recommended!"
3,Red Eye Problem,"I have owned 3 previous pentax cameras, all of which gave good performance and durability. I bought this compact camera because of its 5 spot focusing feature. The focusing features work very good and are improved over the previous models. However, there is a significant red eye problem with this camera when using the flash. As a former professional photographer, I believe this is due to the flash being located one inch closer to the camera lens than previous models. Usually, the farther the flash is off center from the lens, the less the chance of red eye reflection."
5,top notch,only problem light weight. hard to hold steady at hi magnification. im a camera nerd. i want to point and shoot.my photos are everything i ask for . ireally like it after getting rid of my konica slr that i was never smart enough to use.
5,praise,"I recently puchased a pentax iq zoom, the shipping was extreamly fast,even though it was the holidays, the camera is up to my expectations and i'm very pleased with the product and the whole transaction process."
5,The perfect point and shoot,"I am a photo enthusiast and was looking for a simple to use point and shoot 35 mm camera that would create photographs comparable to my more sophisticated 35 mm equipment. Well .. here it is. This little camera produces great results with very little effort. Also, it has a solid feel and a comfortable view-finder, much unlike other cameras in its class. I have used other compact point and shoot cameras and it is often a nuisance trying to look through the tiny view-finders with which those cameras are often equipped. The 130 mm zoom lens is simply terrific. I would strongly recommend this camera - simple to use and great photos. What more could you ask for? You won't be disappointed."
5,Great Boom Stand,On Stage SMS7650 Hex-Base Studio Boom Microphone StandThis is a very nicely built mic boom with plenty of reach. heavy enough which helps also in bump n thump rejection. Glad I purchased it and a reasonable price too
5,A Thorough Work and a Useful Companion,"The more I study Mordechai Cogan's 1 Kings the deeper I get into the original text and context of the book of 1 Kings and the more delighted with its content I become. The detailed but, simultaneously, concise notes while expanding the verses from a textual-cultural-historical perspective, together with a brief, but not 'shallow,' giving of comments and of some history background-wherever is necessary-prove this book to be a highly academic work, but also an easy to read tool for everybody who seeks to have a useful companion while studying the book of 1 Kings."
3,An Oldie but Godie,"This book is an excellent reference for anyone applying to the academy. It is however, outdated. While the traditions of the academy probably haven't changed, much the application process has changed due to technology. As we have read through the chapters, we wondered what else might have changed sine the second edition of book is now 12 years old. I guess it's out of print now and we paid twice the original cover price for it. None the less, it is full of helpful advice. My son, the candidate, and I have read it cover to cover! We would have enjoyed an updated version."
5,How to Get In,"This book is amazing in its ability to both amaze and terrify a potential candidate. It's a must have for any candidate trying to get in. It makes sure to give advice on the mental preparation you must make and the physical riger that is to be endured. As a female candidate this book has helped me answer my questions, end my doubts, and showed me how to prepare. If you're looking into any of the academys get the candidate book!"
5,Country Roads Collection,Always love John Denver's music. This collection is wonderful it spands several decades of his music. Good listening and sing along songs. Also came with pictures and information about John Denver and how many of the songs came to be. 5+ Star - would recommend to anyone who loves his music.
2,Bought 2x John Denver CD collections,"1 of the collections was fine, the other one plays strangely. There are 4 CDs in the collection. The CDs look perfect. It comes with a booklet which was in good condition too but 2 of the CDs in the pack do not play correctly. Its as if it occurred during production as they arent scratched at all. Some tracks are ok, others aren't. Other products I've bought from Amazon have been terrific!"
5,John Denver/ Country Roads Collection,An excellent album. A wonderful collection of John Denver's greatest songs. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves John Denver.
2,amatuer video,"The picture on jacket is what you see the whole time, so that is your view. Too far to enjoy seeing the water. It was hard to relax because who ever made this, never reviewed their work. If they had, they would have heard the LOUD non-ending sound of wind over-whelming the microphone. Instead of waves and birds it was a constant white noise like a vacuum cleaner in the next room. About half way thru, you hear a guy come up and say something like ""you guys making a movie?"" or ""is this one of those movies?"" and another male voice says ""yes"". First guy said ""that's cool"" or something. Then when it gets darker, it's suddenly light again. They just rewound what they already recorded and hit ""repeat"". Waste of money."
5,infant massage,this is the best book if seen in giving infant massages most use dolls but this uses live infants. it is more realistic. thank you.
5,THE ULTIMATE GROSS OUT!!,"a ""fractured fairytale"" if there ever was one!! this movie you MUST watch over and over!! The shock value is high - and the laughs are ""Multiple""! A lot of scenes make you cringe - but - if you are A WATERS fan - and havent seen this - YOU ARE NOT A WATERS FAN!!! for the rest of you - watch it anyway - it is TRUE trash and if you get offended - you take yourself too seriuosly. Edith Massey was FAB as the queen! No Devine here - but still incredible. Mink Stole was wonderful as the high society lady - who , though a turn of events - gets to see how the po' half lives. great cast and all around funny! I have recommended this to more people than I can remember."
4,"Little Johnny Waters, what have you DONE?!?!?","Hello, movie goers! I am a HUGE fan of John's work, but Desperate Living has to be my least favourite movie he's made. I didn't hate it (seeing as I gave it 4 stars), I just don't think it's as great as his others. It seems as though he was trying to rekindle the kind of decadent filth that could only be achieved through Divine's addition to the cast (a la Pink Flamingos). I think it's a great flick, just not the best! I reccommend it to round out your collection, but not to bow down to."
4,A Movie for the 4th Millenium,"If there's a late show 1,001 years from now, this movie will still be showing. As one man said of Pink Flamingoes, ""It's the future of urban living.""John Waters is God of the trash universe he created."
4,John Waters last truly trashy movie,"John Waters began his career making truly filthy and immoral movies (that were all very fun). Desperate Living is the last of his filthy films as he began to make some more family oriented movies, that while they were very different, they were still pretty good.The DVD isn't too bad. My only gripe is that it's in full screen, but for all I know, it could have been filmed that way and I don't know of any other versions. It features a commentary and is uncut."
1,Did I miss something?,"This has to be the most awful movie I have ever seen! I must be missing something, what, with all the great reviews! We did actually watch the whole thing. Waste of time and $."
3,experimental,"A band with huge potential that was never utilized. As killer as their demo was, This 1st full length did not live up to the expectations. The sound is very original and experimental with folk or shamanic influences. Unfortunately the whole material is on the slower side and poorly written which leaves the listener with something to be desired. The 2nd song is an exception with is much faster. Unfortunately one good song doesn't make the whole album good. Most of other songs are somewhat slow & mid-paced atmospheric bm with strong occult themes. I feel that Nastrond had a huge potential but it was never achieved and this release could not compete with Black metal that came out at the time and was overshadowed by like 'Secrets of the black arts"" or ""Heaven shall burn"". Hope this review was useful."
3,Hurry up Elvis - faster faster,"Elvis' band - thousands of hired hands - are in great shape to react to his sudden choices of songs - and they follow him incredibly well. And his singing is pretty good - strong, and mostly in tune. The rot had not set in yet.But - but - the man is not taking his art seriously. How quickly - perfunctorily- hastily - can he run through most of his catalog and make it clear that he really doesn't care about - doesn't respect - the material? Wham bam, thank you ma'am. You've paid your money, you've seen me, I've gotten it over as quickly as possible - thankewveddy much, now I'm out of here.

3,Super Reader,"The first of a series of Darkman books, The Hangman is pretty ordinary. A significant amount of time has passed since the events of the movie, and Westlake is still working on this skin technology, and it still has the same limitations and problems, so he isn't getting very far, and it is affecting him psychologically.He does use it and his abilities to help get some local kids out of trouble, though."
5,LATIN FOR EVERYDAY!,SUPERIOR CLASSIC LATIN INSTRUCTOR. ONE FEELS HIS OWN PROGRESS AS THE PAGES ARE TURNED.YOU CANNOT EXPECT MORE.I WISH IF I HAD ACCESS TO THE BOOKS 2 &3..AND SO ON.I WOULD BE THE ENVY OF THE VATICAN!!!
4,Induction of Bobby,"This is another well written group of compositions from the YJ'sExit Mr. Russo( sorry to see you leave... thanks for the memories) Enter Mr. Mintzer(I hope the spelling is correct) who has brought a darker sound to some of the compositions (in a good way) This CD has some very breath taking moments... which is the norm. for these guys. I have picked up everything since Four Corners, and have been very satisfied with all of them."
1,Don't you just love an incoherent screed,Just exactly how can a Constitutional Amendment be unconstitutional? <sigh> I star for entertainment value.
2,Sloppy,"I haven't been pleased with any Stones output for about 10 years now, but still continue to spend money on the Jagger/Richards juggernaut. I found Live Licks, without the benefit of watching them, to be a sloppy mess with absolutely no cohesion whatsoever. Some of these versions are really alarmingly bad. None of these songs are as crisp as they once were. I'd suggest just pulling out Love You Live if you want the Stones at their best live."
1,This is tough to listen to,I have seen the Stones live dating back to '73. The band has been a 1 guitar band since '75 and it sounds like it on this Cd.Twangy sound and edited songs. I know they are still Rolling but why not capitalize on some of their live recordings from the American tour from '72 or European tour of '73. Do yourself a favor..get yourself an ebay account and bid on the 2 Cd Brussels Affair bootleg of their '73 performance. You will never listen to the 'new' live Licks stuff again.
1,If you're a fan - don't buy it!!!,"I'm a huge Stones fan and just wanted to warn other Stones fans before buying this CD. Most of the songs have been edited to make them shorter. This has been done in a really horrible way. Just listen to the first opening notes of Brown Sugar and you'll see what I mean. But the absolute most horrible ""cut"" is in Rocks off. In the middle of a sentence the next chorus is started. So if you like long, original versions, you shouln't buy this CD. If you're no Stones fan, you probably shouldn't buy this eigther, but buy the (more expensive) DVD set Four Flicks.Only positive side: the uncut songs are pretty good. Street Fighting man is probably shorter than it used to be, but still sounds good. And Can't you hear me knocking also sounds great. But these are the only two highlights to me, so I am really frustrated after buying this CD."
4,A good album from a great band- calm down,"I like this album, it's not my favorite, but it is a good live album. I think it is my second favorite, after No Security, with Flashpoint at a close third. I have heard other live albums mentioned and I don't think that I have enjoyed them enough to listen to them more than once or twice. There appears to be some aggravated folks out there, but I don't see the merit of their complaints. First off, the Stones are, for good and bad, tied to their old discography. If there hadn't been the old songs there would have been people complaining about no old songs. They are fun, and expected, that's why they are on there. Jimmy Buffet can't quit playing Margaritaville, either. Second, the album does not say ""All live and unedited like you have on your dvd."" It what it proclaims it is, a fun live album. This is still better than at lesat 90% of the rock stuff that is out there. So anyway, y'all, calm down, it's only rock n'roll."
2,"(Generally) Good Performances, Bad Editing","Although this set contains too many of the same old songs, the Stones play them quite well. However, botched editing marred what could have been a memorable live album. ""Rocks Off"" is a prime example: Jagger badly muffs the lyrics, and the problem is compounded by the amateurish editing. It seems that it would have been better to have eliminated this cut, if a better version could not be found. Also, do we really need Sheryl Crow on ""Honky Tonk Women""? I don't buy Stones albums to hear Sheryl Crow. Further, why is Keith Richards singing ""The Nearness of You""? This song just doesn't fit in a Stones set. Aside from the less-than-careful song selection and dreadful editing, there are a few worthy moments here; unfortunately, there just aren't enough of them to justify buying this album. There are bootlegs which are far superior to this."
2,How low can they go,"I am not a great fan of the Stones, however having seen them live several times in the 70's I thought a live disc might be the way to go. I added this cd to my Christmas wish list with the thought it will be easy for my kids to pick up for me. Well, it was, but what a mistake. I've stopped paying to see the Stones because $300 ticket prices (Chicago and Milwaukee) is just too much for any band, much less an over the hill group of seniors who are only in it for the money. This cd illustrates it fully. With one exception all the songs are 1981 or older which shows the band has lost its creativity. The vocals on some of the songs are so horrendous, particularly Richards, I played it for my kids as a warning about what happens when you abuse alcohol, cigarettes and drugs too long. I was hoping for a snapshot of what I remember to the world's greatest rock and roll band. Instead I got a reminder of why the state of rock and roll is so bad."
4,Not Bad At All!,"While I agree with some of the criticim regarding the editing of this double disk, the sound is excellent and the performances are very solid. This CD is very representative of the Stones live sound and is a good listen. I've been a Stones fan all my life, I have every one of their albums, and I'm happy to add this CD to my collection. The first disk covers a lot of ground that's already been covered on other Stones live disks but the second disk especially will make a nice addition to any Stones/music collection."
2,Beware: EDITED VERSIONS!!,"First of all, if you already own ""Four Flicks"" then DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!! But on top of that, MOST of the songs are edited and cut down in one form or another; and some of them POORLY edited at that!! ""Brown Sugar"", ""Honky Tonk Woman"", and the worst edit of all, ""Rocks Off""!! When I listen to a song, I wanna hear the WHOLE song, especially when it's live!!I mean, some of the stuff on here really rocks, but a lot of it seems ""run-of-the-mill"", ""paint-by-numbers"" stuff. Even the packaging seems thrown together! And I'm sick of the SAME songs coming out over and over again. Instead of ANOTHER version of ""Start me up"", how 'bout a kick ass new version of ""Midnight Rambler""; which we haven't had since ""YA YA'S"" 35 YEARS AGO!!I love these guys, but I get sick and tired of spending all my money on 'em! My copy has already been sold to a second hand store!! You're better off buying ""Stripped"" or ""No Security"". AVOID THIS ONE!!!"
3,A redundant live album!,"I love the stones. no doubt about it. I have all there albums that they had ever released. Im just wondering why almost all of the songs in LIVE LICKS,particularly in side 1, they had done before in previous Live albums. Any die hard stone fan would be very happy to hear live versions of songs they had done in the past. Live licks could have been much, much better if they had included songs like....SHE'S A RAINBOW, DANDELION, SHE'S SO COLD, ONE HIT TO THE BODY, ALL ABOUT YOU, LOVE IS STRONG,AS TEARS GO BY, LADY JANE,WE LOVE YOU, 2000 LIGHT YEARS FROM HOME,INDIAN GIRL, LITTLE T&A;, HANG FIRE, MOTHERS LITTLE HELPER, DON'T STOP,WINNING UGLY, SALT OF THE EARTH, PLAY WITH FIRE, etc, etc.Anyway, im still anticipating another live stones album in the near future. Hope they do included some of the songs above. Im sure they will release another Live album because the Roliing Stones are here to stay!!!!!!!!"
4,Works for Me,"Out of the six live Stones albums I own, I'd have to put this in the top two. I don't hear anything tired and weak here. Keith shines on this disc. 1 star my ass."
3,Where the Hell is Sympathy for the Devil???,"As anyone who attended this unbelievable concert will know, the best performance was Sympathy for the Devil with the main stage bathed in red. While the band seemed to show their age, they rocked the house with this song. I don't want to dissuade anyone from buying the CD, as it is incredible, but this is more to the producers for omitting what was clearly the best song of of the concert. Oh Well!!"
2,"Stones Commercialism - It's a Crass, Crass, Crass.......",This disc consists of less-than-stellar renditions of songs that we all know (and love). I was most suprized by the sound mix as it certainly does not sound as good as the Four Flicks DVD or other Stones concert recordings.Let's all hope that the Stones next studio effort has more to offer.
3,"Set list taken from the ""Four Flicks"" DVD's","Not a criticism, since you can't play the DVD's on your CD player, but for those wondering, if you already have the ""Four Flicks"" DVD set, you have all the songs represented here."
5,"Take it Easy! Listen to ""Live Licks"" Loud","Why are we fighting? Why are we fighting? Sure, some of the edits are weird, but guys, this is a band and on this CD they are tight. Listen to ""Live Licks"" loud! To me the CDs sound JUST like the Stones sounded in Tokyo in 2003 -- loud and locked in with each other. No Stone stands out on any of these tracks. Everyone is good. Again, play it loud, dance to it, crank it up in another room or in your car, make it part of your daily life and it will grow on you. Don't be like ""Rolling Stone"" and pan it right out of the gate, like they did with ""Exile"". This band is the best -- as a rock band, and ""Live Licks"" captures them."
3,Primarily for Stones Fanatics,"The performances (as well as the audio production) on Live Licks are extremely slick and professional. There are flashes of personalty here and there, but, for the most part, the 13 piece band sounds more dedicated than inspired. Stones fanatics will get some satisfaction, but most would be better off with a good collection of Stones hits."
1,Great Sound but...,"Some of the songs & solos are cut short. Great rare stuff that you haven't heard in a while. The mixing is good, but again.... songs don't flow right. Not in the same order that you'd find on the DVD 4 Flicks. Spend the extra $$ & get that instead."
2,Muffled Old Men,"You can almost hear their shawls blowing in the wind on some of the songs. I'm a died in the wool Stones fan. I have everything. But this is far from their best effort. It sounds muddier than some bootlegs. The playing is poor and the energy - the boys need some Geritol! You can hear Mick running out of breath on Rocks Off. Everything Stripped was, this isn't. While it is nice to get some of the more obscure songs, this is for only real fans. There are plenty of other better examples of how great the Stones are live."
1,Very tired and weak,"I also love the Stones, but this is awful. There is terrible choppy editing of some of the greatest rock every written. The sound quality is poor and the performance is weak at best. It sounds like the band is phoning it in. I was amazed at how lackluster the performance was when I listened to it. Do not buy this."
2,"Man, what is happening here?","First McCartney now the Stones. They feel they need to issue a live record of every tour? The same songs over and over and over again? I dont care how good this album is or if its the best album since get yer yayas out. I am not buying this, I've had enough. Why not giving them for free at the concerts? After you pay 60 dlls for a ticket, a 3 dlls CD is not that much (that's preety much what these things cost to make). Most likely, Mick needs to pay another alimony, or Keith needs some pocket money to hit the strip clubs, and they released this piece of garbage to collect our money. Until they come up with something better, I am listening to Stripped again and again."
2,18ft pool cover pretty flimsy,Cover came fast and undamaged which is great but quality of cover isn't great ours lasted 1 season (not even a full year) seems the draw string that you use to keep the cover snug over pool tear into the plastic easily and renders the cover useless.
3,Disappointed,"Beautiful but...If you are a fan of the Mountain t-shirts, you will be disappointed in this one.The artwork and printing process is as good as you would expect from the Mountain.The problem comes from the t-shirt itself. It is of MUCH lower quality than their norm.Even after many washings, it continues to retain the 'stiffness' of poor quality tees.It also shrank more than the other dozen or so tees of their's I've purchased.I will still wear it and I do get compliments on it but the comfort rating of this tee compared to others of theirs I own is about a two out of five.Just so you know."
3,"Clever idea, but not that clever","I am a star trek fan from way back. I enjoyed listening to the CDs, but from a purist standpoint, Q couldn't lose to spock, and the overall presentation was not as captivating as I would hve liked. Worth a listen, but probably cheaper to buy for your ipod"
5,Saboten Cut N Hold Rose Shears,"I had been using the Fiskers Cut-And-Hold rose pruner and it worked very well. However, I've wanted a cut-and-hold ""needle-nose"" pruner and was delighted to find this one. It's a wonderful product that does exactly what it was designed to do. And, it looks like it will last a long time."
2,Disappointed,The phone is cute and worked fine for about two weeks. The top part of the phone that allows you to hang up broke off when I was answering it. Now the phone is nothing more than a decoration item. Not built to be used for any length of time.
4,Porcelain Phone in Rose,I really like this phone. It has a good reception and looks attractive in my bedroom. My only complaint is that the numbers don't light up at night. What can I say? This Biker Chick likes Pillow Talk.
1,Cheap for a reason,"This swing set will surprise me if it last a year! The sea-saw broke after just 3 days. The assembly instructions were very confusing, there several of the punched holes in the poles that I had to force to line up. My assembly time was about four hours. I will not order another one of these."
5,Good natural antibiotic,"We in our family have used Olive Leaf extract for tooth aches for years and nearly all the time the pain is gone like overnight. It doesn't work every single time but almost. We also take it for colds, flu and the such."
3,Just another supplement,"I found no different in my memory with these supplements. I just kept taking them after two months because I didn't want to waste my money. It work well for other, just not for me. Others may recommend it for memory, I won't. Its just another supplement as far as I'm concern."
3,Everything but the picture,"Nice design, nice ergonomics, nice features. The only problem is that the lens is not very sharp, even for 4x5s. Tried indoors with flash, and outdoors in bright light. I can understand this camera having problems with 8x10, but the small format shots should be better."
5,A great CD!!!!,"I love all of Treble Charger's song on this CD. My favorites are ""Ever She Flows"" ""How She Died"" and ""Christ is on the Lawn"""
5,Amazing CD from an underappreciated band,"RED is such a stunning track. The CD is worth buying for that song alone. That said, the rest of the CD is pretty good, but pales in comparison with the haunting, epic feeling of Red. Very few other songs give me the same feeling notably - ""the unforgettable fire"" (U2), ""black star"" (radiohead), ""behold! the night mare"" (pumpkins) and a few other more obscure songs."
5,Terrific,"Terrific book, good for learning jazz would recommend buy this book, yes, yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes"
4,Great Pictures of Maine,"This book wonderfully depicts the Maine coast and all its beauty. Jim Arnosky not only portrays the Maine coast, but also the way the sea provides Mainers a way of life. As a Maine resident I feel Jim has captured many aspects of the Maine coast that make it so wonderful. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful paintings of the wonderful coast of Maine."
1,Burned out within a couple months!,"I ordered twenty bulbs for the two fixtures in each of my bathrooms. The light is nice and bright, and the turn on is quick, but within a couple of months, two of the twenty bulbs burned out.I contacted the seller, and although he provided me with a replacement, he chided me that these bulbs are not made for bathrooms--that the humidity is bad for them. Are you kidding me? They show a bathroom vanity strip light right on the box!Now, with a couple more months passed, two more have burned out, including a couple that were replaced.Do not buy!"
5,very good value for organic treats-good for your pupper,"These are very inexpensive at this site because they are usually twice the price in all the typical pet stores you usually go to. They are an awesome deal for organic. I try to feed my dog only organic food and treats as close to all organic as I can. I had a dog that was very young, 2 1/2, and he died from cancer and ever since then, I have been very cautious of what I feed my dog now. Organic does make the difference and these treats are low in calories so they are a good treat to give your dog if you are trying to control his weight. You don't have to feel guility giving him/her these treats, they are small and as I mentioned low calorie. I would reccomend these to any dog owner and I have also purchased the chicken, duck and salmon treats made by Plato, all good choices. The Salmon ones are very very stinky though, beware of those, good for your dog though, lots of Omega 3's in them."
5,My dogs love them,"These don't have a lot of unnecessary ingredients in them, which is a big plus in my book. With all the worry about dogs getting sick, where treats are made, and what's really in the treats themselves, I have done a lot of research. Plato treats are made in North America, with only North American ingredients (with the exception of their natural preservatives which are imported from Europe). It's nice to have that peace of mind when giving these treats to my dogs (who don 't care where they come from, but they do love them!)"
1,Dissapointed because my doggie hated the entire line!!,"My Dakota LOVES duck & when the recall happened I endlessly searched for USA made products imparticularly DUCK!! We bought the entire line & she HATED it all with the exception of the 'chicken thinkers' & she's only 50/50 on those.... So, I wouldn't recommend them to 'picky' eaters."
1,Mold all over the treats..in a brand new bag,I have used these treats often for my dog..she loves them. You can imagine how horrified I was to open a new bag today and find the treats covered with mold. Here is the really bad part. I called Plato to report this and their response was that they knew the batch I had (expiration April 2014) had a mold problem and they have corrected the issue that caused the mold. If they knew about it...WHY did they not notify their distributors to pull these bags from the shelf? The gentleman I spoke to told me he would send me a new bag...not good enough for me..my pet store can give me a new bag in exchange for this contaminated product. I am so upset and disgusted with not only the product but Plato's response to this disgusting product of theirs that I bought and almost gave to my dog.
1,My Chihuahuas HATE This Product,"My two Chihuahuas loved ""Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets"", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco. However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death. So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats. I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag. This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips. My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away. It doesn't even smell like duck. Rather, it smells somewhat fishy. A waste of my money!"
2,Niether a ChickenStrip nor a Chicken Jerky ( or Duck Jerky),"This product is more of a crumbly cookie. My beagle ate it for a few days and then refused them. I thought that his digestive system was a bit disrupted by this product, as well. Of course, I cannot say for sure that these treats were the cause of his upset...perhaps my beagle can. Anyhow, I will not be repeating this order."
2,Old Merchandise,"My dogs love these treats and buying them online was much cheaper than retail. However, both bags that I ordered had dry, crumbly treats inside."
5,Healthy Treats-Breaks easily for training,"Well liked by my dog. Order was shipped very promptly, packaged great. Would order again. Like the Made in USA"
4,Duck treats,"Although this seemed like what we were looking for, the picky dog we bought this for wouldn't eat it. Duck is his favorite meat treat buit he didn't like the texture of this one. The other 3 found it to be delicious."
4,Review for Plato Duck Strips,"I purchased the Plato Duck Strips for my 12 1/2 year old Golden Retriever. They are chewy, but not hard, for her old worn down teeth and low in calories as she is less active now due to arthritis. I was very pleased to find them available at a good price through Amazon. Thank you."
5,My dog loves these things!,"I got these from my local pet store, where they carry quality items (made in USA, no grain fillers, etc.). I brought my pooch in one day for his regular food and the shop owner gave the pooch two of these. Needless to say, I am a sucker for my pooch so of course I bought them. After my dog had one of his legs amputated due to bone cancer, I switched from the common store brands to higher quality items like this. I have noticed a marked improvement in my dog's overall recovery. Even if your dog isn't suffering any kind of terminal illness, I recommend that you consider these sticks."
2,maybe it's ONLY my Dog,"but he won't got near these treats. i'm so sad because i have a large package of them. my chuggle/puggle put one in his mouth and spat it out. again, sad."
2,Old Merchandise,"I ordered four containers and two were fine, but the other two were not. The bad treats had a greasy coat on the sticks and when I tried to split the treats in half, they crumbled and fell apart. I am debating on whether to purchase another container because they are much cheaper online, but prefer the consistent quality of the retail store in my neighborhood."
1,These are terrible!,"These treats are the worst I have ever encountered. Yes, they are natural, but good? No. They are dry as hell and I liken them to particle board because of the way they shred and crumble. I would choke if I had to try to swallow these dried up things. Nothing about them resemble duck meat. My dogs wouldn't eat them, and one of them would pretty much eat anything. Would not recommend these at all."
4,Great through and through,This is a well put together cd from start to finsh. Could have been a excellent band for times to come. I still recommend Dry Kill Logic however
1,Not Dry Kill Logic!,"This band is not Dry Kill Logic, please do not buy this if you're trying to here their old music!"
2,Naet didn't work for me,"After reading this book (very dry read, hard to finish), I had NAET over the course of several years with 3 different practitioners. I figured when it didn't work with the first one that it was their technique at fault, not the method. After thousands of dollars, not covered by insurance, and absolutely zero results I gave it up. I had chronic back tension which I hadn't had before but no allergy relief. I did try Bowen work, which is a similar idea of opening the energy channels which doesn't involve the spine. After 10 sessions I could grow flowers again and have them in my house, after sneezing for 3 years solid. Another 10 sessions greatly reduced my asthma to managable levels. I didn't have further improvement, but by then I'd moved to another area and I think my Bowen worker had a different technique. I don't recommend this book."
3,Metal Guru Is It True....Yeah Yeah Yeah,"Metal Guru is a nicely packaged, well put together collection of Marc Bolan/T Rex's Musical Career. Interviews with former band mates Bill Legend, Herbie Flowers and Paul Fenton make this 3 Disc collection a worthy addition to the DVD collection. Insights from Marc's son Rolan and record producer Tony Visconti add value also.The collection includes versions of T Rex songs by The Metal Guru's, a 'sound-alike group'. If you already have ""T-Rex On T.V."" and T-Rex Up Close & Personal on DVD, then steer clear as about 80% of the footage/Interviews on Metal Guru is recycled on these also."
5,Sweet and bubbly!,"You'll be sure to love this delicious fragrance. It's perfect for that little extra gift for a teen, but be sure to buy an extra for yourself."
4,good seller,"Overall, happy with the purchase. The book was a little more worn than I expected though."
5,Stuck In A Moment And You Can't Get Out Of,"Stuck in A Moment is the theme of overcoming crisis (""this time will pass"")and forging on established.Modern pop-soul sound an agreeable shock.Edge keeps it Steve Cropper simple.A keyboard rings out like a bell.Clayton and Mullen punctuate sparsely.And Bono's beutiful voice makes this whole single the perfect one."
1,NEVER RECIEVED ORDER,"I never got this order and had written to the seller several times without a response. I would not recommend ordering from this seller. Waited 30 days for the order to arrive, it never did and no communication from them."
2,mmm...I expected another thing,"When I bought this filter, I expected a different effect in my photos, i was worng when i chose this."
3,So so... Probably not for an absolute beginner,"This book is so so. It's got me through some tight spots while designing. The down side is that it has no real structure to it. It is all over the place when looking for specific topics and doesn't seem to have any coherent order to it. The index could be better. There are also not a lot of good examples. If you are an absolute beginner, you should pass this one by and get O'reily's CSS Definitive Guide instead."
3,"Until IE8 comes out, this book is useless for designers","As Jakob Nielsen said, CSS2 won't be fully implemented in browsers until IE8 arrives. CSS2 holds a lot of promise, but for working day web site designers, it's pretty useless. Most of CSS2 is not implemented in the main browsers: IE and Netscape. The only browser that fully implements CSS2 is Opera. No wonder, the author of the book is the CTO for them. Unfortunately, Opera doesn't show up on any of my logs as a browser being used. I would love to use CSS2. Can't. That's the final word."
5,Beginners: begin here!,"This book is amazingly well-written. As a beginning web designer with basic knowledge of HTML, Cascading Style Sheets, as it's name does not tell you, not only gives a fantastic insght into CSS but also gives the reader a stronghold on HTML.. Also, for all web designers with interest in starting XML and XSL, this book is invaluable as a lead-in as to the why's of XML and XSL's existance. Well written and informative. Buy it."
1,Waste of time,"I wish I didn't read it. I didn't like the way Christy kept sticking up for her sister, making excuses for her and not believing what people would say about her sister. Too much boring conversation about Indian archaeology. Much of the book wasn't that interesting. Certain scenes didn't make sense for me. For example, Cain asked Christy if she would like to have sex. She said yes, they began, then Cain stopped because he thought she might be using him. The next day, he said he was wrong, and asked if he could he have a second chance. For clarification, this book was originally published in 1993 as The Secret Sisters under the author name of Ann Maxwell."
3,Lite Lowell?,I'm a real fan of her work. This book will not make my list of favorites. But it's still worth a read. This was really fiction. Her other works have deeper character development and the action at least possible.
4,Great Story,"This was the first E. Lowell book I read. I thought it was great. Having lived in the Southwest, I enjoyed the Anasazi artifacts storyline and thought it was pretty accurate. Christy and Cain made a good couple and enjoyed their chemistry. Overall B+."
2,eh,"I'm sorry, but I could just not get into this book at all. It's so implausible, and I couldn't get over it. The main character ends up with the ""hero"" after he helps her escape from security guards after an attempted home ""break-in"". She does not know this man, but then lets him take her back to his house. An admitted murdered, he then proceeds to order her around and she follows blindly and cheerfully, falling in love with him despite the fact that he has technically kidnapped her. One of her reasons for following along? He wouldn't drive her back to her hotel (she could have walked, no? or called someone from her cell phone, which she uses to check her messages) I found the whole situation to be rather creepy, and the main character to be somewhat stupid. However, she did handle descriptions of the West and the Anasazi artifacts well.I wanted to like this book, but it fell short of my expectations. The whole story seemed kind of flat and uninspired."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a reissue of one of Lowell's earlier novels. While it's a pretty good read, it is nowhere near her later excellent work. The characterizations are reasonably well done, but the plot stretches the reader's credulity quite a bit.**SPOILER AHEAD**The ending is disappointing: You never get to meet the ""Secret Sister"" and form your own opinion of her, because she's been dead all the while. This would have been a much better book if it had been told from both sisters' points of view, rather than just one.To sum up, not bad, but not great, either."
1,ok but not recommended,I've read other Elizabeth Lowell novels some are pretty good but this was is a real dud! This novel twists and turns but not in a good way. I rarely give up on a book so I really had to push myself to finish this one. I don't recommend this book.
5,The Best Mafia Book,"Plain and simple, this book is great, all you need to know about the Mafia from Capone to Las Vegas. You'd hate to put this book down, I give The Mafia Encyclopedia 2 thumbs up!!!!"
3,Good but not comprehensive.,"Not that user friendly either. No charts, no stats, and no bibliography and thus very risky as a reference source."
2,alot of inaccurate information,this book has great pictures and some of the informaton isn't acurate and while it would be a great find for the amature and beginning mob watcher it is a dissapointment to the novice and experts alike.
3,"Not bad, but...","...page 405 states that ""The forces of Harry Riccobene...did kill Salvatore Testa, the 28-year-old son of the slain Chicken Man Testa, regarded as a real comer in the mob.""(He was in fact hit with a shotgun blast but he survived). Page 406 says ""Scarfo had too suspicious a nature and he soon turned to ordering the deaths of loyal followers, starting with Salvatore Testa, his most competent hit man..."" Testa did not survive this one, but who knew you could die twice? I don't know if there's any other mistakes in this book but that one is brutal."
5,Knowledgeable,"I bought the first edition of this book when it first came out, and found it to be both knowledgeable and unbiased. There is no romanticizing of the mob, simply straightforward descriptions of the major players and events. Highly recommended."
2,Peace Pendant,"This was not as pictured. It looked larger and better looking in the picture. When I received it, I was very disappointed.I did return it, and they were very good about the speed and the credit.I would buy from them again due to excellent customer service if I found EXACTLY what I was looking for."
4,"For the price, these are fine","Hey, caligraphy pens arent cheap. You get what you pay for and these pens are perfect for a beginner. I was more impressed with the company as my first mailing was lost by the post office so they hurried and sent another one by christmas. thank you guys. But back to the pens. with a little practice you can do some halfway decent lettering. real pens go for a hundred bucks or more...so its really on how much you wanna spend"
4,Has enough nibs,"I like this set because it has the type of nibs I want to use in my artwork. I'm not interested in calligraphy, I am more interested in the fine lines that 2 of the nibs produce. It comes, additionally, with 4 calligraphy nibs, which I may experiment with, but that isn't why I mainly bought this set. I think it is well worth the price; the wooden pen it comes with is standard. All you need to do is buy ink!"
5,replaceing a set...from about 30 years ago,I have the nibs from years ago...prob. before I was born. The nibs can last an extreemly long time if properly cleaned and the user doesn't press hard. I learned caligraphic writeing when I was....maby 7 years old...summer camp! I find it fun so I use them a lot...and they really lasted. Now with the old set bent out of shape...happy for a new set!!!!
3,Boring,"Compared to the original series it was boring. I'm a huge fan of the cult classic. I would run home daily to get my Dark Shadows fix, but this didn't do it for me."
5,Dark Shadows The Haunting of Collinwood,"Very good video, brought back many memories of watching Clinton Collins in the original episodes in the 1960's. I think this is how the series ended with Collinwood abandoned because of the ghost's haunting."
5,Quentin's ominous grin,I'm glad I made this purchase. I had never been able to remember how quentin's character came about on the series. A great value for DS fans.
1,Didn't work at all,"ComputerCOP is very good as a way of neatly viewing any picture stored on your computer, but as an internet monitoring program it doesn't work at all. I've gone to hundreds of sites over the past little while, but when I scanned the computer with ComputerCOP, there were only three pictures from the internet in the list ... and perhaps I had downloaded those, I'm not sure.Oh, and the customer support is pretty lousy.Pity I had to give this a star, it doesn't deserve to get it."
3,"Quality gameplay, but is weaked by it's short length","The Playstation version of Strikers 1945 is a near-perfect port of the arcade game. Basically, it's an old style overhead-view shooting game with a theme loosely based on World War 2. There are several different aircraft to choose from, each with their own attack style and bomb shots...but the levels are just way too short. It only takes about 20 minutes to beat from start to finish, and the whole game just has a ""rushed"" feel to it. The enemy design could use some work in a few places also (giant humanoid mechs do not belong in a WW2 setting). Despite it's short-comings, Strikers 1945 is still worth a look if you like the old shooting games like Twin Eagle and Raiden. As with all games of this type though, play it in 2-player co-op mode with a friend if you want to get the most out of it."
4,Best so far,"I really enjoyed reading Ben Bova's Jupiter. I liked the short chapters with endings that make you want to read more. It's one of those books I just couldn't put down. I've read Mars, Return to Mars, Mercury and this book is my favorite of the bunch. Just stated reading Saturn...hope it's as good!"
3,Poor editing on e-version,"I won't repeat the synopsis as the Amazon page gives a good explanation of the story line. I did find this to be one of the better Bova novels that I've read. I do like his near future, hard science approach to the SF genre. For a Kindle version charging the same price as a paper back, I found myself somewhat chagrined at the numerous errors in the book - spelling and grammar.He does a good job of developing the main character - Grant Archer, but the other characters are less well developed. As always, at least in my experience, with Bova, the real main character is the science.I would have rated it at 3 1/2 stars but for the sloppy editing."
1,The Best Written Bad Book I've Ever Read,"What an agonizing disappointment this book was for me. Ben Bova is an amazing author with great talent. The book instantly caught my interest and kept it rock solid till the end, when I wanted to throw it out the window. It's an adventure novel without any of the satisfaction I get out of most Sci-Fi books. If you looking to explore alien ""ideas"", ""culture"", and ""technology"" don't read this book. Bova has so many unexplored thoughts I wanted to cry. So good yet soooo bad."
3,Could have been good if he'd spent more time on it,"Too many science and logic flaws. He talks about the hydrogen/helium atmosphere getting denser until it's liquid, but then talks about a ""water"" ocean. He mentions a space suit having a small rupture on Io, and gasses from Io go IN to the spacesuit. The lack of pressure on Io would make a rupture vent gas - no way for it to come in. Reactions of some characters are unrealistic - and it's obvious they were unnaturally forced to be that way to make the plot go the way the author wanted. There are several more of these type of flaws which dropped it from ""good"" to merely ""ok""."
4,Pack it for the weekend away.,"An entertaining book, fast read. Loved the plot. A little too close to reality at times..."
2,Embarrassingly flat,"Bova gets points for creating a hero with religious convictions, but beyond that this book was startling in its general lack of imagination. The characters had no dimensionality, the plot seemed predictable, and the spirit of adventure and tense anticipation that could've been created by the exotic setting was M.I.A. In all, a bland and excruciatingly juvenile read."
2,"No sublety, SciFi of the lowest order","I love scifi, but I'm at a loss to explain the success of Bova's books. His writing is predictable and often repetitive, his plots are loose, and his characters are flat. His technology is contrived, and thinly explained. This book hits you over the head with his philosophy on science versus religion, and instead of asking interesting questions on that front, resorts to near lecturing using the unispired device of character thought monologue. About halfway through this book I lost interest."
2,Cheesy but occasionally exciting,"Really unconvincing, stereotype characters with painfully corny dialogue. Solid, tense pacing though."
3,"Very similar to Venus, but a bit better...","Jupiter is easily compared to Bova's earlier novel, Venus. Like Venus, it follows a familiar form of someone reluctantly adventuring to another planet. It also similar to the Mars (Mars and Return to Mars) and Moon (Moonrise and Moonwar) series, and actually shares the same ""universe"" as those books.However, I would recommend the Moon and Mars books before reading either Jupiter or Venus. Then, if you like those, I would then recommend Jupiter and Venus. Furthermore, the books are all loosely connected, in sharing the same ""universe"", time, and making some references to one another. They also seem to take place in approximately the order they were written.However, beyond the throw-away connections, each ""planet"" stands alone, so they can be read in any order and independent of one another."
3,Sometimes the science was better than the fiction,"I almost put this one down during the first part of the book. The writing was in parts cringingly trite, choppy and simplistic. I'm glad I persevered, because once the protagonist gets to the Jupiter station, it picks up speed, and the author hit his stride more. The end was quite a page turner. It could have been better with some editing at the start, but it was still worth reading. Unlike others who have reviewed this one, I liked Mars better."
1,Disappointing,"Having read Bova's books on Mars exploration I was very disappointed in this book. It was not up to the standard he set with Mars and Return to Mars. I found it to be juvenal. It was hard to believe it was written by Bova. The characters were shallow and it contained goofy elements like a talking gorilla and dolphins on the space station. Much of the book was what I consider ""fill"". The whole story could be written in a few paragraphs and it was expanded to novel length by silly arguments and conflicts between the shallow characters. I know he can write a good yard and I hope he does better in the future."
3,An SF thriller worth a read (minor spoiler),"I managed to read the entire novel in one day, and it kept me entertained. It has enough mystery, action, and adventure to keep you engaged, and the personality is enough to make you care somewhat about the central character, Grant Archer.Now for the romance. There isn't any. The story has Grant getting married early on, then the newlyweds are separated for the rest of the story. The only point of it seems to be to set up some level of continuous frustration, but it somehow seems to be felt by the reader more than by the protaganist.Favorite line: The next few weeks were quickly dubbed ""The Wrath of Wo."""
4,reveiwed by that one kid..,"Ok...this band is great and all..but not the best..and I saw someone call them ""melodic death metal"" HA! these guys arent remotly close to being melodic... One thing I got to hand to these guys is..they're not a bunch of hypocrites like todays death metal bands... Like you know how todays death metal bands claim to not like religion ,but then all they do is attack christianity then ,run around wearing pentagrams (a gay RELIGIOUS symbal of many beleifs whether you wanna admit it or not)but anywho...these guys.they claim to hate religion...and they actually thrash on more than just Christianity *gasp* They attack Satanist TOO!..Dont get me wrong..IM %100 Christian ,and I dont like them thrashing on my beliefs...But I also think its more thatn awesome that there not hypocrites and actually know the true meaning of not likeing religions, so if your looking truw beleif ,non- hypocritiacl death metal ,then buy this album"
2,Strange...,"I bought this tape a few years ago at a used music store for a dollar, just to see what it sounded like. I was somewhat impressed, having been accustomed to the morbid metal of Cannible Corpse, but greatly amused. I can't figure out how he got his voice to be so low the whole album. It's just strange..."
2,Overated!!!,"This CD is really overated.1. First, think of the voice: it's plain and monotonous (listen to the voices George Fisher can get in Monstrosity's Imperial Doom).2. Second, the music: Songs sound very simillar, there are no much difference bteween them. Even in an early Death album you can guess what song they're playing. The guitars are muddy, and the drums go the same thru the entire record.I recommend you to buy a Death, Indwelling or Monstrosity album. You'll be more satisfied."
5,Brutal and Malevolent\m/,"This is one tech death band that you will not forget. There's plenty of songs here to listen to over and over, and you will not be disappointed with this buy. I know I'm not\m/ this is one of the best death metal bands I have ever had the pleasure of letting their sound pound itself into my brain relentlessly."
4,So Informative,"This book chronicles the journey Vancouver has taken from being just another random Canadian city to being ""Hollywood North"" and a hub of Canadian independent filmmaking. Being a part of the Vancouver film industry, it's great to learn its history and the major players, many of whom are still in the game today. I like the personal stories of the actors and directors living and working in places I work and live."
1,Sold Individually! Not A Set!,"Item description says ""Set"".....which means two or more.Buyer's beware! These are packaged individually.....not in ""Sets"".You will need to purchase two of these items if you want a ""Set"".As far as the product? I give it 5 Stars! Product is just fine. Good quality Gasket!Pat from Minnesota"
5,Riveting History of a Seminal--But Almost Unknown Civil War Campaign,Closing the port of Wilmington cut-off the last viable supply route to General Lee's army invested in the trenches around Richmond and Petersburg. The capture of Fort Fisher--the Gibraltar of the West made the capture of Wilmington inevitable and sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The largest amphibious assault launched by the United States up to 1865 and not bested until the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944--is almost unknown by the average American citizen. One of my ancestors fought at Fort Fisher and I have devoured every book I could find on the subject. This book is the hands-down the best. Well-written and comprehensive...the kind of book you find hard to put down.
2,"Lots of pretty pictures, little information","A pretty book with lots of full-color illustrations throughout, but not nearly as much information asThe New Natural Cat: A Complete Guide for Finicky Owners,Cat Care, Naturally: Celeste Yarnall's Complete Guide to Holistic Health Care for Cats,Dr. Pitcairn's New Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs and Cats, orNatural Healing for Dogs and Cats. Get one (or more) of those instead of this."
4,Still has some of the best features available,"We've been steadily adding lines to our home phone set since 2004 when we received the base station as a wedding present. The phones have been invaluable - there is even a baby monitor feature which we've used religiously and you can use it on more than one child at a time (if you've got a dedicated handset for each room and each monitor).The refurbished item had some minor scratches and cost as much as the new handsets originally did, but I have yet to find a newer Panasonic DECT system that has the baby monitor feature. So for now, we're sold."
1,CAUTION! Do not use in planted tanks with shrimp :-(,"I selected Flourish Excel after viewing (and rejecting) several planted tank fertilizers that listed copper on their labels because I planned to add freshwater shrimp to the planted set-up. I used this product, and was pretty cautious with the dosing because the tank is a small one. I added the shrimp about a week later, but sadly, they did everything but ""flourish"" even though the tank was lush and green and the water parameters were perfect. When I tried to pinpoint the cause, I discovered that Flourish Excel contains copper after all! This should be clearly on the label so that planted tank enthusiasts don't unwittingly kill their copper-sensitive invertebrates.Bottom line: It might be a good fertilizer, but if it kills the tank inhabitants, it's still no good. Don't buy it if you have (or may have) freshwater shrimp or copper-sensitive plants or fish."
5,Great Product,Product is a great supplement to get some solid quick growth. I combined this with some extra lighting and instantly could see daily growth on most of my plants.I highly recommend this if your not running CO2 in your planted tank as a little booster for initial growth.
5,Brand is #1 for me,"Excel is used for a few reasons. No need to restate the product description here, but it works. I personally use it mainly for algae control, as I have CO2 injection for plants' fuel."
5,Eliminates algae in a planted tank!!,"This product was suggested at an aquarium gardener's club meeting as something that feeds aquatic plants and knocks the algae right out of the tank. I tried it out, and in less than a week, the hair algae that was plaguing my tanks was blasted out. Try it if you want a gorgeous aquatic garden with healthy plants!"
5,Flourish excel works,"I've had difficulty getting my plants to grow, primarily java fern, and anubias. I had plants just melting away due to to much light and not enough nutrients for the plants. After using the flourish excel for about 3-4 weeks, the plants have new growth. All in all the product works, who would have thought if plants are given co2 and enough light they grow."
4,good product not great,this helps my plants alot and helps them grow the only problem I have is when I pour it in after a hour it makes the water smell weird and the smell lasts for 3-4 days this is bad for me because my tank is in my room and it makes my room smell bad and I constantly have to put air freshener but other than that this works great
5,Good stuff.,"Best aquarium invention since fish. I use it usually mostly daily in all 4 tanks, with a nutrient fertilizer (Tetra FloraPride) on weekend water changes."
3,Old Version,"AquaChurch has recently been updated and I would suggest the newer version. This version is old and antiquated. If you are a fan of Sweet, then you probably understand and love his writing style. If not, then it will be difficult to engage with text."
4,The adventures of an obscure hero.,"I was very surprised to see that this book is now in print. I searched for years to obtain an original copy of it, which was privately published in small numbers, and apparently given to Burnham's many admirers. The book is of most value if one first reads his fascinating book ""Scouting on Two Continents"". Burnham was one of the most fascinating adventure characters of recent history. His adventures covered the American Old West,Africa, and Alaska during the Gold Rush. He was a very tough man, and his entire life was filled with dangerous adventures. I hope ""Scouting on Two Continents"" will soon be available. Burnham's life should be the subject of a major Hollywood movie."
2,Typical Greatest Hits (Not),"As with most Greatest Hits collections, the record company leaves off just enough hits to make you wonder ""What they were thinking?"" They also put on a few tracks that make you wonder ""What were they thinking?"" Here, there are some obscure tracks that clearly are ""filler"" while omitting some of his best tracks from rock radio and even Top 40 Hits? Where is I Found Somebody? (Oops, that was only his first Top 40 ""hit"") Where is ""Partytown""? (Probably his best party song and a big hit on AOR radio in the early 80's). ""Don't Give Up"" was also a rock radio track and a great song from his first album. I would title this album ""Some Hits, Some Mediocre Stuff, Some Stuff Sorely Missing, Sorry."" Now, where is that Eagles box set we have been waiting 20 years for?"
3,"its not the worst, not the best","You get what you pay for, some hits, some lost melodies, and some I am just not sure of but OK"
5,Glen Frey cd review,"CD arrived very quickly with no damages as it came very well packaged, it had also a reasonable and competitive price, will buy again for sure, I am very satisfied with service."
5,Hakeem The Dream,"DreamShakeIt displays pure basketball essence of the ""The Dream"".Hard work and fundamental mastery with monster talent making him a man amongst boys. Defensive dominance, intimidation, and unstoppable offensive prowess are too few superlatives to describe Hakeem Olajuwon and his game. Watch as he leads the Rockets to NBA titles in 1994 and 1995."
4,Hakeem,"To all the basketball fans is a good chance to watch one of the greatest centers of modern era. A master of the fakes and spin moves wit outstanding defense.Maybe was missed to add his last championship again Shaq's Orlando Magic and before that the match we won, humiliating David Robinson. It would be excellent."
2,"Humorous, but potentially dangerous...","This book is much more humor or biography than business reference. I was looking for something, not to teach me how to play the normal game of office politics but to play it in a different way or combat it with dignity, self-respect and a respectable work role in tact. If you have a cold heart and no concern for others, or are just seeking some humor then by all means, take a look at Lichtenburg's book. But tactics described in this book are very sleazy and will be a gamble to put into practice for the caring and professional person. They worked for her, but she's lucky. And I bet she has trouble looking herself in the mirror. Then again, maybe she doesn't, but I would."
1,Despicable and backward look at workplace politics.,"Make sure your worst enemy gets a copy of this book. After a week of putting these ""lessons"" into practice, you'll no longer have that enemy around. Another book that tries to sell high-schoolish behavior as a way to get ahead in business. After putting down hard work and trying to get along with people, the author tells a bunch of war stories that sound more like episodes of ""Melrose Place"". Then, her ""Evil Twin"" gives advice on how to really screw your victim (unwarranted or not). There is a slight tinge of prejudice here when the author declares that no one at the office likes a sick person. I guess being in a wheelchair or having MS makes you a perfectly legitimate target for these kind of office games. A waste of time and paper, this book is a great argument for why the workplace is changing. If America is to compete in the new global information economy, we can't afford to play these wasteful and demoralizing office games."
1,How to Get Ahead - by Stepping on People,"I've read my fair share of management books - and this is the first one I've literally thrown away so no one would be tempted to borrow it. It gives a cynical, spiteful, and even cruel perspective on ways to advance your career. The only example this provides for career advancement is a bad one. Perhaps she might still be (successfully) employed at Prudential if she treated people like human beings. OK, I'll admit that not all coworkers always fit into that category, but it sure makes for a better overall work environment.Shred this one and purchase _Jesus, CEO_ and Blanchard's books (One Minute Manager) instead. You'll sleep better at night."
1,Weak and weird,"The ""lessons"" learned in many of the stories would be hard to turn into practical techniques. One thing that struck me as odd about the book, is that the people who work in Lichtenberg's office seem to spend an awful lot of time thinking up mean nick-names for each other. Maybe it's an East-coast thing. Anyway, my advice is save your money for something else."
3,Too much salmon,"I never thought I'd say this about a spread but there is actually too much salmon and not enough cream cheese. As packed, it's a bit salty and dry to the point that is crumbles as opposed to being spreadable. When I opened the second can I mixed it with an equal amount of fresh cream cheese and threw in some capers with excellent results. I couldn't find anything to do with the tin can so I threw it out. I bought this on sale at over 60% off of the list price - which is a pretty good value."
2,Not at Top of List as Pate,"I agree with the previous review, the product looks like ground up fish which it is of course, but the taste is marginal. I haven't tried to ""doctor"" it up as yet, but on its own, it is lacking.And as to the ""votive,"" well, that is a nice idea but unnecessary."
3,"Beauty, Madness & Money","The movie is very grotesque even for a parody. Most of the characters in the movie revolt us by their ugliness, madness or greed. The movie seems to suggest us that the concept of beauty is NOT relative. Well, I agree, however the main character appears ugly not as much because of her body size not even because of her acid-scared face, but because of her pure madness. She is a sick, mad woman, and she does a great job in portraying it. But equally grotesque are her employers who try profiting from suffering and madness of others.The movie is a bit too lengthy in getting its points across, and some of the scenes and characters are mediocre. Still three stars is a good rating and it shows as much of my admiration for it as it revolts me."
5,TOTALLY BRILLIANT TRASH,"This as got to be my favourite movie of all time, I never ever get sick of watching this. I watched this film many years ago when I was looking at videos to rent and I found this, the story line itself should make any one want to watch this, all my freinds have been forced to watch this, some loved it, others horrifed by it, take it all with a pinch of salt and sit back and laugh at such trashy behavior. Its not to be taken serious , but I dont think these films ever where ment to be. Just outragous and crazy humour, if you like shock value, watch this film. The wonderful Divine plays her best role to date"
5,"camp, drag, cult classic ....","divine is at his best in this one !! be prepared for a john waters bedtime story... .. mink stole as ""taffy "" dawn davenports, not so young and or attractive looking daughter .... and the wonderfull edith massey as her ""mucho"" less then attrative nieghbor !! ""aunt ida"". is to much for one person... this has camp , gore , degradation , drugs , and a story line that is disturbingly funny i highly recommend this for any john waters fan and or divine fan !! this was my first ""divine experience"" and trust i havent forgoten it yet ..... i recommend ""pink flamingos"" as a companion !!"
2,Good taste but a real disappointment,"I'm the naysayer here on this product from Nabisco, I'm so bummed that I bought these, have this box sitting here-is useless for me. First of all, no one mentioned that these are tiny-more like a cereal size than a real cracker. I was looking for a healthy cracker to put my sheepmilk/Manchego cheese on, which would be impossible with these tiny things. PLUS, I prefer a cracker that doesn't compete with cheese or a nut butter, these are really a snack onto themselves, but because Nabisco doesn't list all the ingredients, I stupidly took a chance and assumed these would be safe for me with my food allergies, but I was wrong, they have onion powder in them. AHHK!. A wasted puchase."
5,Anthropology and the bloke,"A smart, insightful and endlessly funny piece of writing. This is a profound book about men that hides its profundity exceedingly well.Hornby takes male readers to places we know only too well, but were never able to describe quite so eloquently or hilariously... and gives female readers an anthropological tour of the bloke that does for the unmapped, confused, confusing and often simply ludicrous regions of the male psyche what Diane Fossey did for the world of the African primates. (Actually, the subject matter is probably a lot more similar than many of us would like to admit, except apes learn that if you hit yourself on the head with a branch and it causes you pain and distress, it's probably a good idea to avoid doing it again - and Hornby would suggest that most blokes haven't quite reached that advanced level of reasoning yet).Highly recommended for anyone in possession of a penis, or anyone else curious about the owners of said organs."
1,"Dreary, at best","Even though I have written dozens of reviews, I have never disparaged a book before. Never. Until now. I read this pathetic piece of rubbish about a year ago and every time I pass it on the shelves I want to punch it. Fat lot of good that'd do. Maybe I'll just burn the copy I have. Not because it's so bad, but because Hornby is clearly a smart guy, can string words together, and yet concocted this god-awful tripe. Frustrating waste of talent."
4,Fun and relaxing,"I had big expectations on this novel and fortunately, it didn't disappoint me. It's easy to read, all the cultural references just make the text even more entertaining. The best part? It really gives you lights about guys' behavior."
2,Liked the movie better,"This is only happened to me two times but you know when you are reading a book and all you can think about is you can't wait to start reading another book you had your eye on to read. Well, this is exactly how I felt through this entire book. I always feel like I have to finish a book even if I do not like it, so I kept reading it because I felt I had an obligation as a reader. Throughout the entire read, Rob (main character) kept repeating his opinions and how he felt about the depressing world around him over and over again. It was like revisiting a really [junky] day over and over again at the beginning of each chapter. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because of Barry( a character in the book). He helped me get through this book that I thought would be better. Maybe I will not fully comprehend this book till I am Thirtysomething but until then this book stunk."
3,not his best,"this is not nearly as good as his subsequent novel, about a boy which was much more meaningful. this is a flighty novel about a young man in London and his problems with women, which are kind of run of the mill and not too profound. there is some humor here, the way rob and the guys in his record shop make endless top 5 lists (top five episodes of cheers, etc.). but it's not enough to sustain the novel, which is somewhat weak. the book was highly acclaimed and i do think nick hornby is a great writer, but this is definitely not his best work, despite what others think. it's an enjoyable and amusing read, but definitely not a deep one. sorry nick."
3,whiny start that got better,"it was hard to get through this book at first. I got annoyed with the main character's ""woe's-me-i-got-dumped"" schtick in the beginning, but it got markedy better as he developed. by the time I finished it I was glad I stuck around."
5,Number One With A Bullet!,"This is definitely on my ""top five"" list! Being approximately Rob's age and a pop-rock fanatic since 1964, he hit the nail on the head. I thought I wasn't going to like it at first, but, OH MY. Well, I can't do it in order, but here's my top five: Searching for Caleb (Anne Tyler) Harriet The Spy (Louise Fitzhugh) The Time Garden (Edward Eager) Operating Instructions (Anne Lamotte) High Fidelity (NH)Thanks to my ex-husband who practically held it in front of me until I opened it!"
3,"It was just ""ok""","It was o.k. I think most of the reviews were over-rating the book. Its really a ""one-time-read-only"" book because there isn't that much emotion in the book that would draw you back to it."
4,Very Believable London Lifestyle,"Lately, I've been reading a lot of books set in metropolitans and this was a wonderful blend of 1st person monologue and good British dialogue. Nick Hornby, while not a writer of great depth, certainly knows how to capture the mood of a generation. Cheers!"
5,For guys who want to read about relationships,"As a guy, It is difficult to admit that we are interested in reading an occasional story about male-female relationships. Of course, it is also equally difficult to find a story that effectively connects with male readers about such a topic.Rob would make a lot of guys top five list of guys we most identify with. He is immersed in his record albums, spends countless hours in frivolous conversations with his friends and is constantly belaboring his complete inability to start and sustain a relationship.In Rob we find a soulmate, because he has a philosophy about making a good cassette mix, constantly organizes his music and makes lists of his favorite things.Even more so, he connects to our own equally stupid habits about relationships. Fortunately for Rob he finds an answer about how relationships should work. Too bad so many of my buddies haven't gotten the same clue."
5,This Book is Brilliant!,"With ""High Fidelity"" Nick Hornby succeeds in creating a believeable, sympathetic, intelligent character in Rob Gordon. Hornby's style is conversational yet aviods any hint of cliche. As an aspiring writer myself, I only hope that I will one day be able to articulate my thoughts in such a refreshing and though-provoking manner as Hornby has. This book was impossible to put down and when I was finished I longed for more. Now onto his other books. This is how I wish I could write."
3,Annoying and Whiny,"While Nick Hornby is often a funny and concise writer, it was really difficult for me to like reading ""High Fidelity."" That's because the protagonist is a 36-year old proprietor of a record store who truly excels at whining, being a selfish jerk, and basically acting like a sixteen-year old. His girlfriend dumps him, so he promptly sleeps with a hot singer and when that doesn't satisfy him he begins stalking his girlfriend. And when his girlfriend decides that life is too hard as it is and she doesn't want to start over again all he wants to know is how good her sex life was during their separation. There really isn't much to like about him at all, and when it's entirely clear that he'll never be punished for his bad behavior I found there wasn't much to like about this book as well.Honestly, who reads and enjoys this crap?"
5,"If you thought the movie was funny, you will like the book!","That may sound cliche, but it's true. ""High Fidelity"" is a book I bought more out of a lack of choice - I was in an airport about to go on an 11 hour flight, and it was that or some lame Robin Cook medical thriller! I knew I loved the movie, but I thought for some reason I wouldn't like the book. For the first like, 25 pages, I didn't even enjoy reading the book. But then I suddenly GOT Nick Hornby's sense of humor, and the book was hilarious! I read it probably twice during my trip, and I've read it a couple times since then. Right now it's on loan to a friend, and I know she'll love it too. There are too many funny parts to even rememeber them all, but I just thought of the one where Barry joins a band - and by coincidence it is called Barrytown? Well, I would HIGHly recommend this book, no pun intended. :)"
2,Review of High Fidelity,"The book ""High Fidelity"" deals with the story of Rob who has his own record shop and who has been left by his girlfriend Laura. Now he wants to start a new life. To clear up he wants to see five of his exes again.I did not like this book very much. For me it was too pretentious because I did not understand much of the vokabulary.I also find the characters of the main persons strange. The book is too unrealistic and too long for the instruction.I think the characters are very crazy. I prefer other books.If I had to give stars to this book, I would choose two stars."
3,"REVIEW of "" High Fidelity"" by Nick Hornby","I like the book High Fidelity because it isn`t an ordinary book.Most of the books in school are very boring, but High Fidelity isn`t boring because ist describes the development of a life of a crazy young man. It is interesting for teenagers besause we also have problems with love and relationships and so on.I think that a few teenagers could understand Rob, the mail character, and his problems."
5,Hornby makes you feel like you've been there done that!,"This book makes all men (at least this one) feel like, yepI know that type, she broke my heart. Rob (protagonist)makes you sympathize with him because you have been therewith the girl too good looking, the one not good lookingenough but won't leave you (yeah right). And you can almostalways agree with any top five list in the book as spoutedoff by Rob, Dick or Barry. A nostalgic look at past women,music, movies and pop culture in general that has you noddingto yourself; Exactly!!!!!"
5,Feel like someone had read your mind?,Hornby's terrific in describing the thoughts and painof those of us who can never seem to figure it out. I lookforward to his next book.
3,Moderately amusing,I bought this book with the expectation it would be as funny as the two Bridget Jones book. It is not. It was fun reading the various top five lists that the characters came up with for almost every situation. However the abortion of the girlfriend was a turnoff. I sold my book to the used book store for credit rather than reccomending it to anyone.
5,High fidelity kicks butt.,High fidelity is the best book that I have ever read. It is thousands of times better than the movie. Nick Hornby's style of writing has earned him a place in my list of top 5 favorite authors (read the book youll get it). I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of music and/or owns a music shop. This book gives us a frighteningly realistic look into the lives of Record Shop employees. Saying that this book rocks would be the understatement of the year.
3,Do guys really relate??,"Being a women, of course, I would really like to know if there are guys that are actually like Rob. I found this book interesting in the fact that Rob is very insecure (being an insecure women I can relate, or should I say women in general). Rob is lost. He can only describe himself by using his ideal ""Top 5"" pop music lists. Even though Nick Hornby has created Rob as an insecure individual he can teach the reader a lesson. Rob explains a lot about the adult lifestyle. He explains about relationships and the mind of the male species. I especially enjoyed the symbolism Hornby creates with Rob being so attached to his pop music that it is the only thing he can relate to, at first anyhow. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to figure out themselves. I would even suggest it to those girlfriends who may want to figure out their boyfriends and their pop music."
5,Hornby has a remarkable talent.,"To say the least, Hornby has a great talent that many of us wish we had. I'm most like Horny, in terms of thought. I just don't have the ability to write them down such like he does. His observations are incredible. This is more than just a fictional story, but a view on life. His Top Five lists have more meaning than just being a Top Five list. Afterall, everything (and everyone) needs a reason to be within the top five.Overall, I'm speechless in response to this book. Not only is the story flawless, but Hornby's writing and observations of life itself are amazing. The end where Rob (main character) realizes and admits to his on faults is ingenious.High Fidelity is a quick, great read. I recommend it to anyone (especially younger adults). Sit down one weekend and read this book. You'll be amazed. The next weekend, check out the movie. John Cusack does an excellent job with the character and has great chemistry with Jack Black."
4,Generation X-er Analyzes Love,"This book is one I am highly recommending. Nick HOrnby takes his real-life background of working with music & writing & combines them flawlessly. The story revolves around Rob, a Generation X member who is reflecting on how his past loves (musical loves & human loves) impacted him. Rob tells of stories of young, naive love, followed by young adult love, & leads into his current love. He has some help in telling his story along the way with two sidekicks from a music store he owns. The two co-workers bring humor & help in trying to put things into a simple list of top 5...ANYTHING. Rob divulges more about how his heart is hurting throughout. This book is written VERY well & anyone who is a child of the 80s will have a stab of nostalgia as an added bonus. A must have!"
5,"Much like Ann Beattie's first Novel, Chilly Scenes of Winter","The best novel about agonizing over a relationship since Ann Beattie's first novel, Chilly Scenes of Winter. So Much of High Fidelity reminded me of that novel. In fact that girl's name was also Laura. This certainly is a great first effort! One of the best since Beattie's"
2,Not one of the top,"High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is not a very interesting novel because it doesn't have much suspense and there are long passages in which he describes the shop or something else. That is boring but there are also a few funny passages, even if they are rare.The main plot is that Rob Fleming is dumped by all of his girlfriends and now he wants to see them again.Rob is a ""macho"" because he is egocentric and doesn't think about his girlfriends' emotions and thoughts.Laura, his last split-up dumped him because he didn't develop and she couldn't cope with this situation any longer.The language the book is written in is very colloquial. Rob speaks like a teenager. He isn't very respectful and mature. The language reinforces this and it shows Rob's emotions. This is typical of him.All in all, I think the book has a few funny passages but exept of these it is boring, but readers who like stories of not much suspense and many descriptions would like it."
2,High Fidelity,"On the one hand I didn't like the book but on the other hand it was okay. Nick Hornby is a good author, I think, and he is very creative. His speech is funny and varied. He has chosen many different and also extreme characters. ""High Fidelity"" isn't a book like others. I think it is both, a diary and a novel because you find out a lot about Rob's thoughts and feelings.But what I didn't like was Rob's character. He often is selfish and egocentric. He can be a real macho and isn't interested in someone else than himself. But after a while ha changes. It seems as if he has matured. He develops from a boy to a man.All in all the book isn't the worst I have ever read. It has a few boring passages bur if you don't take Rob seriously the book is funny, too."
5,Someone wrote my life story.,"Since I run a record store, and have had some pretty horrible relationships, I thought this book was written exclusively for me. Sure this book is funny, but, it hit so close to home, that I'm sitting at home in the dark all Sunday, with Etta James to keep me company. Caught them filming some of this movie over the summer in Wicker Park. Between this and Lloyd Dobbler, John Cusack and I have some sort of bond. He knows me."
5,Give this to a man that you love...,"I picked this up in anticipation of the movie and tore through it one rainy Sunday afternoon. This is one of the best books that I've read in a good while. I agree with the majority of the male reviewers that said that this book described them perfectly -- I'm not a man, but I think this book helped me understand the ones in my life a little better. I sent my copy to a friend of mine who reminded me very much of Rob, and sure enough, he not only agreed that he was like Rob, but he wanted to send copies to his friends so they in turn would understand him better. The movie is pretty faithful to the book, but I urge everyone to read this at some point in their dating lives. In the meantime, I'm buying another copy for myself since my friend is keeping mine!"
2,lousy,"1. It is very original; 2. Biting wit and numerous laugh out loud moments; 3. Several pop music and movie references; 4. Startlingly accurate depictions of male post-breakup pathos; 5. Numerous London colloquialisms let us know how they live and speak in England.I absolutely loved this novel. It was witty, exploring with a keen eye relationships and the reasons why men and women get together, and sometimes drift apart.'this is so nothing' yes i know hes successful......"
2,Depressing,"I thought Nick's life was really depressing, even though it's probably the truth. I mean, his relationship is falling apart, he works in a record store and well, he doesn't think about anything besides his past failures. Also, he kept talking and talking about music, and which kinds are 'cool' or whatever. Overall, I really felt down in the dumps after reading this book because it made me wonder if my future will be like that."
2,Utterly Depressing...,Ok now here is one book that is so sad it will make you want to snuff it! Not a good book to read if you're already feeling depressed- despite it's uplifting ending. It has some mildly amusing moments and some interesting theories about relationships. However the book left me feeling completely empty.
2,Overrated,"This book was very highly recommended to me. It was an easy read, but did not deliver any of the promised wit and sparkle. In fact, it was rather dull. The arguments over musical taste were the highpoints, but otherwise, the characters and events were flat and boring. Plus the constant self-bashing, supposed to elicit sympathy from the reader, was pathetic. And no human being, no matter how dim witted, would lie in a muddy flower patch in their only suit to avoid being seen by an ex-girlfriend. No wonder she chucked him."
5,Hornby hits the bulls-eye,"It's rare that I find a book that is so true-to-life on the subject of everyday life and the relationships that surround it. I kept finding myself nodding in agreement at so many of the Rob character's observatons. The musical references were hilarious...and being in possession of an enormous CD collection myself, I could feel Rob's pain. The characters are expertly drawn out, to the point where I genuinely wanted to get to know them in person. Unlike the pretentious blatherings of Bret Easton Ellis in ""Less Than Zero"" (which I enjoyed -- when I was 17), the characters and situations in High Fidelity ring true. I didn't want the book to end. Now I have to check out Fever Pitch and About A Boy! Bravo, Nick Hornby...this book is a wonderful read, even though some of the British slang escaped me."
4,I felt like he had used my relationships as research,Laughing and wincing I definatly enjoyed this book. Frightingly accurate
5,Frightening!,"If your in your mid thirties and wondering why life isn't turning out quite the way you dreamt as a kid, read this book. A wonderfully crafted tale that strikes a chord on every page. It allows you not just to see the thoughts of the central character but to believe in them, to really feel their authenticity and the reasonableness, even inevitability, of their illogicallity. It casts a light on the thin line between success and failure, choices, the path dependency of life in general, hopes and regrets. A must read!"
4,"""High Fidelity"" meet ""Bartleby""","I read the 1853 (yes, 1853) short story by Herman Melville named ""Bartleby, the Scrivener. A Story of Wall-street"" the day before seeing the movie ""High Fidelity."" I am struck by the similarities between ""Bartleby"" and ""High Fidelity."" Both stories are about the boredom of dealing with records and copies of records. Both focus on the owner and his clerks. Both are about transitions:- In ""High Fidelity"", from youth/vinyls to adulthood/CDs- In ""Bartleby"", from rural/farm to urban/industryNone of the reviews of this book that I have read have mentioned this relevance or ""coincidence."""
3,"A spot on ""boys own manual "" about record geeks","This is now released as a movie I believe. I cannot say anything better than Tina B's review below. I can only add that I identified completely with the language and priorities of Rob even though I'm old enough to almost be his grandfather. Some things never change! The only difference is my music is jazz and classical. Rob thinks about what music he would like played at his funeral! How many of us have thought about that? I'm torn between PEACE PIECE by Bill Evans and MILESTONES by Miles Davis. Shades of THE BIG CHILL! Shades of ego-centric adolescents! Do all men remain boys at heart? HELP! It's extremely well written, and captures the language of record ""geeks"" well, but is no masterpiece. Excellent read for that long flight."
4,straight out of my head,"while i was reading this i kept finding my self saying this is being pulled straight from my head! very witty real and hysterical, the only thing holding it back from a 5 star is the fact that its too british but still a classic"
3,For the Tape Makers,"Anyone who has ever made a compilation tape for their girlfriend (instead of actually expressing their feelings direclty) will enjoy this book. The British slang gets a bit thick, but overall a good airplane read, with a half-dozen LOL's. Don't expect too much insight into the human soul.I just saw the movie and it's a bit disappointing. It glosses over the personal complexities that make these characters interesting. Tom Robbins' performance saves an otherwise dull adaptation."
4,If you are male and single... you can relate.,"I read this book at a time when I was actively dating, and trying to deal with multiple X's. The talent that N.H. has for puting complex feelings and situations into highly amusing writing is amazing. Aside from the fact that this book is highly amusing, every man that has actively dated has a lot in common with the protagonist. The book follows him through multiple breakups, and manages to turn tragic and depressing situations into comedy. I highly recommend this book to any man."
4,High comedy with High Fidelity,"Nick Hornby's book is a must-read for any man, woman or child who has ever encountered that fanatical zeal common to musicians and record collectors alike. Having lived with a musician for years, and having a father with a record collection that is slowly taking over the house, I found this book with it's cast of characters somewhat re-assuring, as well as a damned good read. I love Nick Hornby, his characters are the Bridget Jones' of the male world: full of insecurities, obsessions and neuroses but ultimately lovable for all of the above. Read it and laugh."
4,"Fun read, some thought provoking too.","Never saw the movie from start to finish, so the book was fresh for me. A nice read, gets you thinking about life, especially if you're a guy who has been through some relationships...."
4,fun,"This novel was fun to read and it has a very engaging voice, I liked the main character, the music references, AND it does a very good job of explaining what it is like to be in the post-relationship blues."
4,The View From The Mind Of A Guy,"""Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content.""Being a thirtysomething musician, I can certainly relate to this book. (Thankfully, I sorted my things out long before Rob ever did.) A great view of what goes on in a guys mind, it's a recommended read for anyone who feels like things ""didn't work out the way they planned"" but needs to realize that things did indeed ""work out."""
2,yawn...,"The book starts on a promising note with Rob recounting his top five heartbreaks of all time... Yet, the upbeat, jazz-like rhythm of the intro gradually stumbles into a series of indistinguishable vignettes that progressively stunts any kind of character development, and leaves you totally indifferent about Rob's outcome. The feeble ending is thus comiserate to a story that is lacking in content."
5,"Sharp, intuitive detail.","I loved reading this book. The author vividly describes the happenings of the main character; a music store owner, looking for love. If you enjoyed Trainspotting, you will also enjoy this."
5,Hilarious and accurate,"I daren't give this to friend of mine in London - it seems directly aimed at parodying himand many similar hip, middle aged sex starved males there. Has enough in UK jokes to keep theBrits happy, but also has some worrying but universal truths about the male (sub) species.Good background reading for feminists!"
4,Brings back good memories.,"Just a fun, easy read about guy/girl relationships...from the guy's point of view. While the main character was different from me in many ways, I could completely relate in 9 out of 10 experiences. I hope you enjoy too."
4,Woody Allen with a Twist of Brit,"Whining, 30's something, music obsessed, English guy can't get it together. He searches in all the wrong places to blame everything in his life on someone else. His character is so well written, he becomes annoying and there is a real need to hang in there with him to find out if he ever figures himself out. Self centered, going nowhere, taking advantage of others seems to be his lot in life. Interesting presentation of how some men view the world, waste their lives, and those who are drawn to them."
5,Hit The Spot,"This is a story about love, friendship, sex, rejection, getting older and knowing what you want in life.It is full of humor and some poignant moments too. Fans of Nick Hornby (like me) will love this book. Anyone who hasn't read anything by him before read this one first - you'll be hooked. (Suggestion for a perfect partner - Steve Horsfall (You Are Here), i.e. captures all of the above)"
2,Not for me,"I personally don't like this book, because it is only about everyday life of one man, Rob, who has got the same problems like thousends of other men have. Okay, I confess some parts of the book are quite funny, wehn you read how Rob is simply to foolish to handle his relationships with hie (ex)girlfriends an all these typical mistakes he makes."
2,Loved the movie but the book.....,"I loved the film High Fidelity starring John Cusack. It was witty, funny, enjoyable and engrossing. So I bought the book thinking that a book is also better than the movie, especially when the book came first. At first it was enjoyable, very similar to the movie, but the I came upon many scenes that had been left out of the movie, and for good reason. By the time I had gotten two thirds of the way through I had gotten so sick and tired of it that I had to put it down. In the movie you liked and hated Robert, but in the novel you just hate him. I could barely relate to his bleal outlook on everything, and many of the ""humorous"" lines which appeared in the movie and the novel didn't have the same feeling in the novel, the came off as sad sayings of sad people, not as abnormal sayings from abnormal people, which in essence is better than the former. It was in whole a dissappointment."
1,A true arse-hole,"I wish I hadn't seen all the Woody Allen movies and just read Dave Eggers, because then I might've liked this book. I found this book extremely pretentious and boring. The theme of losers content with being losers is in all of these ""slacker contemporary novels,"" and it's getting so tiresome. If you're a loser, don't read this book, because reading a book about losers is a waste of time."
3,A little over-rated,"Firstly I should state that I am English and I like Hornby as a writer, his Fever Pitch is the perfect testament to the British football fan (okay Soccer to you lot in the States). So I was quite looking forward to this, many of my friends rate it as one of their favourite books, and it does seem to appeal to both sexes. Having said that I was a little disappointed and I suspect that it is because of me rather then the book. I never lived my life through music when I was young and did not associate many events/people with music and songs. I never wrote endless lists either.If that sounds like you, then this will be the book for you, if not then perhaps it is not. Likewise it is an insight to a certain type of male, but not all males!This is no bad book but I think it works if you see yourself in it. I didn't!Much as I hate to say this, the film was probably better."
3,Are men REALLY like that?,"This quote says most of it:""... a very funny and concise explanation of why we men are as we are. If you are male, you should read it and then make your partner read it, so they will no longer hate you but pity you instead."" -Harry Enfield, Independent on SundayI really do hold out hope that Rob, the main character, is not as much like every man on the face of the earth as the critics seem to think. Because if that's true, then I'm depressed. I didn't like Rob. Even though he had some moments in which I sympathized with him, and I really honestly TRIED to like him, I couldn't. I wanted to slap him. He knew he was being an idiot and went ahead and did it anyway. That's kind of unforgivable, to me. Men, if you're really like this, please just leave me in ignorant bliss."
5,Read it! Read it!,"This is my first Nick Hornby book. I also have seen the movie based on the book several times and would say that it makes my ""top five"" movies, or at least top five comedies. With that experience, I have John Cusack and Jack Black quotes burned in my head and I was acutely aware of the differences between the book and movie (it does transfer well, though). So I enjoyed the book immensely but made comparisons throughout.The book has perhaps a little more acid to it - it's in a gritty part of London and the protagonist comes across as, well, less nice and less attractive than Cusack. I am not saying this is bad - the book perhaps has a more realistic feel to it. Hornby has a sharp wit and gets inside the 30 year old unmarried male brain perfectly. The book's language, while not particularly sophisticated (we are talking about an non-college educated record shop owner), flows nicely.Read this book (add a bullet for emphasis)!"
3,Must try harder,"Probably worth three-and-a-half stars.This novel has some very funny moments but I did tire of it a bit.I'm not sure I liked the point of view character a lot - and that's a problem when the book is written in the first person and you've really only got one character to choose from.There's comedy to be had using a combination of what the first-person characters says and what they really think . But that becomes fairly predictable over the course of a novel.Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood to enjoy this novel. Perhaps I hungered for meat and three veg and what I got was blamange. Sweet enough, but it didn't fill me up"
4,Hornby nails the male psyce,"Ive read that men should not let their girlfriends read this book, because it gives up all of our secrets. I don't think High Fidelity is so devistatingly honest, but one thing is for sure. Hornby knows how to relate the male experience better than most of the contemporary authors I have read. This book, in particular, has a stylish quality that is refreshing. The constant categorizing and listing the main character does is so perfect. It is easy to relate, as a music fan, to this character, though one cannot help but wonder how he gets by, especially in London of all places. Hornby prooves witty and charming in High Fidelity. I would give it 5 stars, but I didn't want it to end the way it did. If you like good music, or being a man, or even if you want to get a bit of an idea how we think, I definately recommend this one."
2,Typical modern British writing,"This novel is in the same vein as the Adrian Mole and Bridget Feilding stories; simple observation dressed up as literature. The book is amusing, but remains on the level of a simple statement of facts (or observations) and never analyses any of them. I draw an equivalent between this and easy listening music, literary Dire Straits, to maintain the pop metaphor of the book. Lots of froth, but little or no beer."
3,Ehh,"Only the second time I have ever thought the movie is better than the book. Too wanna be hipster for my taste. The characters were mostly unlikeable. The movie, on the other hand, has Jack Black."
4,By far one of the top five books I read last year.,"Reasons: 5. A music shop in London as the setting - the land where music is born. 4. Passion for the music overwhelms the main characters being, even more than football (Fever Pitch) 3. His life is analysed in the most meaningful of all soundbites. Not to trivialize the moments in his life but to show him it's always been worse at another time. 2. F#!$*%g Hilarious. 1. Articulates the meaning behind a man making a mix tape for a woman."
5,"Funny, and wonderfully self-depreciating","A great book, the intertwining of pop culture throughout made it a very human book. It shows how not only music and movies affect us but how they affect everyone around us. The story of the relationship between Rob and Laura is bitersweet. Everytime Rob makes another attempt to regain Laura you want him to succeed, no matter how illogical the plan. All in all a great book that reads fast."
5,this is my life.,"Really. I feel cheated. Someone stole my current life and put it in a book. A must-read for all men, in or out of relationships."
3,"See the movie, save a few bucks","After seeing the movie (which, BTW, I thought was merely okay) I found that it had originally been a book, and moreover, the book was considered far better. It wasn't. There is one thing this book is full of: little life lessons. I can't imagine anyone picking this thing up and not getting to thinking about onesself. It has very light prose and easy dialogue--the themes are mature, but anyone with an IQ over 80 could read it--you'd almost think this thing were written for a movie. Its a quick read, but most of the themes and important dialogues are in the movie. Save yourself the cash and time."
2,A let down,"I was let down by this book. It was hyped up quite a bit by my friends and the reviews. Details said to keep it away from your girlfriend. I was told it was Swingers in book form. However, i found it boring. Not funny, not witty look at relationships, and stale characters. I was very disappointed"
1,"Boring, boring book","""High Fidelity"" is about the life of the record shop owner Rob Flemming who has just been left by his girlfriend Laura. To find out why every girl breaks up with him he meets all of his ""top five most memorable split-ups"". Eventually Rob and Laura get together again and they will live happily ever after.I think the book is not very interesting but maybe this is just because I'm not intelligent enough to get the point."
2,If this is a comedy we're all in trouble.,"I am amazed by the number of people who said, ""The funniest book I've ever read!"" while I thought it somber, even depressing at times. It did indeed possess comic elements, but to label this a comedy is missing the point. Rather it is a four-hour therapy session(or however long it takes you to read this book), poking and prodding the ins and outs of relationships between men and women. The book was not so much eye-opening as it was startlingly accurate. Rob is without a doubt one of the most concrete characters to come out of recent fiction. Still, I felt that the author let us down at the end, in not having Rob stay true to form. I can say no more without spoiling. All in all: half a thumb up."
1,Bad edition,This Kindle edition of HIGH FIDELITY was not spellchecked and is littered with typos introduced when it was scanned by optical character recognition software. Incredible.
4,Nice to get a guy's point of view...,"Its taken me a while to get around to reading this one, but I am glad I finally did. In a literary world full of Bridget Jones and her ilk its nice to see the flip side of the coin. While no where near as funny to me as the books with Brittish female singletons as the central characters this was a very entertaining read. I enjoyed the song references very much and many of them brought back some memories from my own past. What I liked best of all was that in a sexually reversed role from what we normally see, Rob was raised out of his stagnation by Laura, his girlfriend, instead of Laura waiting for Rob to rescue her. Now I am off to watch the movie based on this book and see how they compare."
4,Bridget Jones means her match,This book is as neurotic as bridget jones is in her diary. The most refreshing thing is that it's about a guy (not a girl) in the nineties trying to figure out why he always ends up in dead end relationships. I think Nick Hornby is not only an honest and quirky writer but he writes in such eloquence and ease that one goes through this book in a matter of hours.
4,A True Music Lover's Guide to Relationships,"A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book for Christmas. What a revelation! I had never heard anything about Nick Hornby but his book seemd to be describing me as if we had been close friends since childhood. The way his narrator uses music to classify and understand life is something not only myself but I'm sure countless others as well. The story is thoroughly entertaining and anyone who is looking for an insight into the middle aged man's mind need look no further. Fans of pop culture will laugh (or at least knowingly smile) at the references to Cheers, Elvis Costello and James Bond. Those people who are looking for simply a good tale will find Rob's journey to relationship nirvana a rewarding and compelling trip worth taking."
4,A contemporary mirror in which we can laugh at ourselves.,"Being the same age as the author, I was all too familiar with the unending diatribe that exists in the head of a fairly hip yet not-so-young person. Hornby's protaganist is very much like alot of folks I know with his vast knowledge of entertainment trivia and how it relates to day in and day out life. He is also ridiculously funny in his attempts to be ""deep"" and ""authentic"". Aren't we all? Just the other day I was on the phone with a very close friend and every other line of conversation was a direct reference to a song or movie. Our lives are deeply intwined with the media, I mean, come on, where were we all in the 60's and 70's! Kill your television"
4,Really interesting,"I tend to read books from the female perspective but I like Hornby's insights on the English male perspective. As a musicholic who is married to a bigger musicholic I could relate, Having been in many independent record stores he was dead on with the descriptions of the characters and their obsessions with record buying and lists of favorites. Again he creates an interesting character study. Much better than the movie."
3,High Fidelity is OK,"The novel starts out fine: good character build-up, great little lists about songs and women in our protagonist's past, etc. then, it gets kind of boring and staid. The end was very predictable. the character's voice is lakable and funny... very charming. Now, put some meat behind this character and a better novel would appear."
5,Just Read It!,This book is brilliant -- a laugh-out-loud experience. It's definitely a book I'll buyoften and give to friends. Nick Hornby's characters are almost *too* real. Do as I say... just read it!
4,What a fun book to read!!,Never boring...very entertaining look at the insecurities of the male mind. There should be more books like this one!
4,The male Bridget Jones,"Definately one for the boys this one. I know a few men who Rob was so like in a number of ways. Thats not to say of course that being a woman I didn't enjoy this. Hornby has such a great writing style and wit that I did find it hard not to laugh out loud at the absurdity the situations he got himself and the musical snobbery. A book that is funny, honest and at times touching and which I suspect, Mr Hornby, was fairly autobiographical. You can't really ask for much more from a novel really can you?"
4,Real Romance,"High Fidelity is a glimpse into the way REAL relationships work. Throughout, the narrator, Rob, contradicticts the reality of love with the fantasy that he always thought love was. There are the mundane details of the break-up and the move out, plus the ""lets still be friends"" attempts that never work. Occasionally Rob seems like a bit of a dolt, and this observation makes one not always totally sympathetic towards him. His life seems to be drifting along and he doesn't seem to care either way. But this is the character and at least he is honest. I wouldn't call High Fidelity a ""page turner"". But it certainly is an easy read and a good one at that."
4,High Fidelity,"I did read the book before seeing the movie, but believe John Cusack was the best possible actor for an American version of the book. In a quirky, semi-neurotic sort of way, Rob portrays an underdog type of persona who chooses to live life by his standards, not that of the current status quo. Cast for the X generation but universal in many themes. Should women be allowed to see how men actually think?"
5,A quick read that leads to a satisfying ending,"Let's not mince words. This novel speaks for itself, so I will spare the plot summary, and simply say that this is a fast read with much to consider and delight in. You will be there, right in the story, smiling and laughing. And for your efforts you will be treated to a wonderful ending which avoids any trace of sap. This is no small achievements, and I tip my hat to Nick Hornby. Thank you, sir."
2,"Good philosophical passages, but boring plot","The book ""High Fidelity"" is about a guy called Rob, who talkes about his girlfriends and ex-girlfriends through the whole book. It's also a little bit philosophical, because he talks about death.I didn't like the book very much, because there's only a simple, short plot, and a lot of thinking passages. The story wasn't that interesting, but Rob's attitude towards and thoughts about philosophical themes were sometimes really interesting.Because these good and boring passages exchange I would give the book two stars.**"
2,Middle good,"I would give ""High Fidelity"" two Stars. ""High Fidelity"" has not such an innovative and fascinating plot that you could give it more than two stars. But the plot is not so bad that you would have to give less than two stars. I think it is a middle good book. And because of that I give it two stars. I would not say that it is a must to read it, but you could read it if you like lovestorys and storys in which a character changes."
4,Very enjoyable,"This is one of the rare occasions when I actually enjoyed a book more than the film (and I did like the film). Nick Hornby has a knack for just writing about things I like. The regular references to Top 5's is a clever touch as it nudges the reader to compare to their own. This is entertaining from start to finish, not too dissimilar to the film and very easy to read."
4,a good read,"Like so many other books I have read lately, I ordered this one based on the advise of other amazon reviewers. Forty pages into the book, I was not sure if I made a good choice. I thought the book might be a bit shallow, and a waste of my time. The more I read, though, the more I realized that this wasn't just a slice of life story, but the bearing of someone's soul. It is a very honest account of the things that go on in a man's mind in regard to his relationships with friends, lovers, and circumstances of life. Even though on the face of things I am a very different person than the main character, I was amazed at how much we thought alike about so many things. This book does not try to paint a picture of a superhero. It, rather, paints an honest, revealing picture a real person trying hard to figure out just who he is. Once I got involved in his thoughts, I didn't want to stop reading. It's a book; buy it and enjoy it."
4,Why SOOOOOOOO expensive,Nice Album with catchy Tunes but Amazon....WHY is it so expensive?? This is not even the import version?
4,Love the waves,Frederic Fekkai Luscious Curls Wave Creating Spray works rather well with my hair but without some sort of product to control the curls you really couldn't tell so I use it with mousse and together my hair has some really nice waves to it.My hair is thick and can be rather coarse and I have my hair thinned out. Prior to thinning out my hair this product did not seem to work as well and I suspect it's because of the weight of my hair.To use this product all you need to do is spray it on wet hair and either let your hair dry naturally or blow dry it.
4,Slapstick 60's Genre,"A film starring a few of my favorite cast members; Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole. It's great for the time period that it was filmed and this should be the prospective with which to watch the movie. Having said that...I'm not certain if any editing was done from the version originally released 40yrs ago. I've heard that this is done when older films are released on DVD, which is a disappointment. The original should be left untouched. Since I have no comparison, the rating I gave it is based on my viewing this movie for the 1st time."
2,Hasn't aged well,The song is so famous I thought the movie would be interesting. Sadly it wasn't much more than a weak slapstick Benny Hill like comedy except with hot 60s women. Pluses for that but pretty dorky. Hopefully the song is not tainted for me.
2,Am I hard of hearing?,"The sound quality on the DVD was atrocious. Too bad, given the great Burt Bacharach score."
2,This definitely was not a 'funny' movie,"And by funny I mean funny 'ha ha'. It had a funny beginning, but that was it. Very disappointed in buying this one, I thought that since Peter Sellers and Woody Allen was in it, it would be funny, but it wasn't. No funny lines, or any creative situations. Pretty bland movie. I'll have to stick to movies by Blake Edwards instead."
4,"What's New, Pussycat?","Peter O'Toole, as a troubled fashion editor, visits psychiatrist Peter Sellers for help with his fanciful and complicated love life (Romy Schneider, Paula Prentiss and Capucine). However, Sellers has problems of his own and at time the roles become reversed. Ursula Andress also drops into the fray. Woody Allen is present in what I believe is his first film as both actor and writer. The film shifts back and forth from sophisticated comedy to slapstick. I always liked this funny and outlandish film. The VHS copy is not bad. I did find that the sound level was not consistent."
3,Would have been a better movie without the silly go cart chase scene ending,"This movie has all the elements of a well done classical farce however it does not have a great finish and I feel that really slides this movie from being a good piece of work to an average piece with the ending being a total flop. When I get the urge to watch this movie , I never watch the ending go cart chase scene. I think the ending became the beginning of our current movie genre of humor for the masses in our society, vulgar , silly , over the top nonsense."
4,The Ridiculous and the Sublime,"Maybe sublime is too strong a word. This is one mess of a movie. It's like a nerdy kid trying desperately to be cool. Most of the jokes are unbelievably juvenile and even lame, and it's often obvious many of the cast members realized they were in a piece of crap and decided to at least enjoy themselves-- which actually helps.That said, there are moments (and I mean moments) that make it worth watching. Paula Prentiss steals the show from everyone, there are some laugh-out-loud lines in the picture and some of Peter O'Toole's reactions are priceless. Another good scene is the one Peter Sellers and Woody Allen share. Finally, there may even be one emblematic shot in it too, during the getaway at the end of the picture.What's new Pussycat is endearingly goofy and AWFUL, but I'm looking forward to it coming out on DVD."
5,A Golden Oldie,"Having heard the title song by Tom Jones long ago, I never knew from where it originated until MGM played this on the tube. This sure is one funny movie. Peter Sellers and Peter O'Toole, two of the biggest actors in the sixties, make a great pair and provide a unique chemistry with many laughs. Others will also find appeal in that this movie was Woody Allen's silver screen debut.What's New Pussycat?, like most movies, won't find favor in everbody's hearts, but it sure tickles my fancy."
2,It gave me a headache,"There were a few (not more than 5) funny, Woody Allen type remarks. The movie was much too long, repetitious, just chaos around a simple theme. For once I agree with the Amazon staff reviewer, it wasn't as funny as it should/could have been. Hell, it wasn't funny at all! According to the Amazon reviewer, Allen's script was rewritten (let some washroom executive try a stunt like that today!), and that probably accounts for the tedium. It had a clever (kind of) premise, and probably would have been funny if Allen's script had been left in tact and if it hadn't been nearly 2 hours long. Peter Sellers was outstanding and delivered the Woody Allen (?) lines with all the perfection they could hold, and of course Allen was funny with his (?) own lines. Other than that I thought it was a drag. Sellers shone."
1,Unwatchable,"I recorded this from TV, and tried to watch it. I even tried to just watch a little each day, to see if there was anything remotely funny in it. I finally gave up yesterday, and erased it. I actually felt sorry for Peter O'Toole, that he had to do the unfunny things he had to do in this movie. Life is too short to sit through this thing. Amazing that some people think it's great. Unbearably bad."
5,Metal Slug X,"In the land of me too 3D everything this game is very refreashing even for a PS2 owner. The game a very good conversion from the arcade version of the slug series. This is the type of game that you play just to enjoy the art work , as you blast your way through each level the games art and background just get better and better. Unlimited continues mean you will beat the game in one sitting but the skill and and challenge of trying to do this without the continue along with co-op 2 player will have you stomping through many times. Action , Comedy , 2D shump.."
5,just great!!!!,"metal slug X is a very fun, entertaining game.there is no real plot but its fun anyways, you go around shooting, bombing and killing the bad guys; very simple. at the end of each map there is a boss like figure that takes you a like longer to kill and when you do that level of the game.the only problem with this game is that it is too easy and you have an unlimited amount of lives. the creators should made it like:(1) a limited amount of lives and should of left the game play like it is.(2) unlimited amount of lives and made the levels harder and also add levels (because the game could be beaten within the first hour or 2 of playing.)nevertheless the game is very fun; a good buy and has great replay-ablity."
3,Don't know.....,"It's hard to describe this game. When I first got it, I loved it. But after I beat it about five or six times, it got pretty boring. This is just one of those games with a good concept but it gets ruined by how short it is and how quickly it loses your interest. And, after you beat the first mission, you can except all of the others to be exactly the same. Shooting, shooting, and more shooting. Not that there's anything bad about that but it gets pretty pointless after a while. Rent Metal Slug X and beat it once. But make sure you don't beat it over and over because you will dislike it in no time."
4,well worth the buy,while the xmas periods postal service was abysmal. the package finally arrived. in good order. fully sealed. and was just as good as i remembered it as a kid. a great blast from the past. my brother loved it. his late xmas present / early birthday present went down well. very happy now its here. though next xmas i'm ordering 3 months early lol hate the xmas postal problems.
3,Pretty Good,"I purchased this one because I enjoyed it as a kid. I watched it with my son (11) and he enjoyed it, too. Kind of like a Star Wars type-story that's animated, with the young naive hero setting off on an adventure to save his people from oppression with the help of a smuggler with a ""heart of gold."" Decent animation, though not what is available nowadays. Interesting characters and storyline with a happy ending. Some shoot-outs and explosions but not a lot of violence - plenty of action."
3,Unique Story with Star Wars Basis,It is a unique story with a few characters having a remarkable likness to several of the Star Wars characters. I originally saw this movie in the Theaters (Oh so many years ago). However if you look past the obvious above it is a very good movie. I purchased the Video years ago and wore it out. I have been waiting for this for over 10 years and pre-ordered it the day it was announced. I hope this helps.
5,Still an awsome movie,"I loved this movie when I was a kid and I still love it, Definatley a must buy for any collector."
2,money maker!,"I'm a Deep Purple collector for many years! and I hate money making style! it had been released for 10 years ago as a 2 CD Set SCANDINAVIAN NIGHT - Live Stockholm 1970. the gig was the promotion of IN ROCK album during 1970, what Deep Purple had done on that tour.I bought it ten years ago. Why does the record company re-release this one again?MONEY MAKER STYLE!"
3,Just OK,Similar to my review of other books this type. OK but turns out a little less than what you first expected.
2,Superficial and biased,"This story is very interesting and would have become an excellent true crime book, provided another author had written it. There is a complete lack of background information on the victim as well as on the murderer: only the most basic, superficial facts are stated. We are left in the dark as to why Gail was so unhappy in life, or why Bob turned out the way he did. Imagine if Ann Rule had written this story! What a difference it would have made. Also, I dislike Crowleys way of portraying the victim as a person with almost no positive qualities. He is far from unbiased here, and he doesn't even hesitate to go inside Gails mind and relate what she felt and thought when she tried to commit suicide. In my opinion, this is a most unethical behaviour on part of the author."
2,Undeveloped,"I had not read Kieran Crowley before and now I probably won't again. After reading this book I felt somehow cheated. I have read countless true-crime and murder mystery books and the only reason I finished this one was because I really can't stand not finishing a book. The characters seemed completely undeveloped until the very end, when the author finally seems to come through and add what seemed to be lacking throughout the entire book. I would not recommend this book and would instead direct true-crime readers to Harold Schechter."
2,Lacking,"I have been a fan of the true crime genre for many years now, and can say that this is the first time I have felt that the victim actually played a part in their own death. This is the story of an obvious sociopath who happens to become an MD. The victim in this story appears more concerned about her status and bank account than she does about her safety or her husbands mental health. The victim knew her husband's rage and continued to stay with him so that he could finance her education and pay for her new lifestyle. I don't see how anyone who knew them would later be surprised that it ended in such a horrific manner."
4,The Question: Would You Have Voted To Convict?,"An interesting analysis on the circumstantial evidence leading to the conviction of Robert Bierenbaum of the murder of his wife Gail (Yes this is technically a spoiler, but its right on the back cover)Crowley paints both characters in impartial light. In fact the ""victim"" may be portayed as worse than the monster killer (though I don't think I'd like to be neighbors with either of them).Crowley discusses the background of both Robert and Gail, the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the subsequent life of Robert up to and including the trial. One wonders if Bierenbaum had been more sympathetic, or had a different judge in his trial, if he still would have been convicted.The coincidence are almost fictional except that this is a true story.As another reviewer mentioned, the style and tack taken by Crowley is what makes this book interesting."
4,Intense Read,"For those who enjoy real life crime drama, this book is for you.The author reels you in immediately, and once hooked, you can't put it down."
3,I went to grade school with the two sisters...,"The younger one was the one that I knew, a high achiever, apparently to the present. While I'm sure Ms. Katz (Bierenbaum) was a difficult person, the circumstantial evidence was in fact overwhelming. It is too bad it took 15 years to get to trial while the violent lying psychopath continued to live free. Relieved that justice eventually was served. A. Katz continues to devote her working life to the law and to helping those in need."
4,Interesting,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. Kieran Crowley really got us into the minds of both Robert, Gail and all the characters involved in the story. It was a book that I had to stop and think about many times while reading.Did Robert Bierenbaum kill his wife? I honestly don't know and that's after reading the entire book. There is a lot of evidence that says he did, but I am not convinced and I don't know why. I would have had a very hard time sitting on this jury. I probably would have been the one that everyone hated because I could not make up my mind.All I can say is I hope he did it since he is spending his life in jail but again, I am just not convinced. Kieran Crowley's writing is great. Very easy to read and never boring. I will again be on the lookout for more true crime by this wonderful author."
2,not very accurate,"There are several inaccuracies in this book. I grew up in the area, and we did not have to put electric blankets on our batteries, nor take them in the house every night. We did have to connect the electrical cord from the block heater to an outlet, or there would possibly not be enough cranking amps to get the vehicle started the next day. Makes you wonder what else is incorrect."
3,All right game,"This game takes a while to master, especially the side-scrolling sequences. For a Nintendo game, this wasn't bad, it just took some patience because in the side-scrolling game, you had to earn power-ups to be able to perform special moves, but if you moved through the levels patiently (enemies could jump out) the game was easy enough to beat. This game is about the second Karate Kid film, not the first, and you fight Chozen in here."
1,Stupid movie even worse game.,"This game is the poster boy of flaming cheap games not worth playing. Terrible and not fun what so ever, this games causes suicides."
4,final fantasy 8 squall figure,Very cool looking figure. Nicely made and it feels pretty durable. Mainly for collectors of course. Most kids wouldn't know of FF8. Looks cool put together with the sword and the stand sitting with my other Final Fantasy figures.
5,Great Figure,"Wonderful display figure for FINAL FANTASY 8's Squall Leonhart. He's my personal favorite out of all the heroes, and is excellently crafted here. Sculpt is very good, and the jacket looks perfect. The Gunblade has a very sharp point, so this is not for play or for kids."
4,Chemistry Help When Stuck,"What can you do when your grandchild is stuck on a Chemistry problem and you are far away? My very brilliant grandchild does get stuck from time to time. This is her first year to take chemistry and once in awhile she does get stuck on a problem. My response is to order a copy of the Chemistry Problem Solvers and have it shipped directly to her. She has already benefited from using this book. We have learned that when she has spent an entire weekend trying to solve a problem for which she has no preparation in the class, this approach is like a visiting tutor.We have a number of the Problem Solver series and have passed them on to our granddaughter. As she takes new courses, we give her the next book or order it for her."
4,Fascinating insights into African history and culture/gender,"I highly recommend this book. The author writes a compelling account of both the history and culture of her tribe, as well as of cultural tensions in leaving Africa for America. It made me rethink assumptions I had always made about what's best for women because the author presents what would normally seem very chauvinistic attitudes and customs in a light that is at once objective and also subjective, but subjective from a non-Western viewpoint. She also presents awe-inspiring pictures of several generations of women in her family who, though possibly idealized to some degree, obviously overcame huge adversities and exhibited amazing strength of body and mind."
3,it works,It works but you end up with an obvious patched area. The color matched well - almond. I was looking for something that would look more professional when completed.
1,What a mess!!,"I really hate this product. If the crack was on a horizontal service it might have been a little better. I was repairing a vertical surface, and the first problem was getting the patch to stay in place. The actual epoxy mix was difficult to keep it where you wanted it, as it kept running. The finished job is probably water proofed, but it looks really crappy. Would recommned seeking other options to using this product!!"
4,Not perfect but fixed problem,"My only concern with this stuff was that there wasn't enough ""bone"" pigment to actually match the shower color. it was a little messier than i expected but, it fixed the crack and i didn't have to buy a new shower stall so it's a win."
2,Worked Somewhat,Worked to patch the hold but does not have a professional look. I was looking for a product that would restore the tub to it almost perfect condition.
3,Works ok,"I had a couple of chips in a metal bathtub that is almond-brown in color.The almond color of this kit is much lighter than my bathtub - it would have been nice if they included a couple different mix-in colors.The process was pretty easy, I cleaned the chipped areas in my tub well, mixed the ingredients together including the almond color additive, then painted it on with a brush.I think I brushed it on too thick, as the repaired area is raised up, but at least it covered it well. The dried repair surface is very hard, I expect it to be quite permanent.Work fast, it hardens quickly.It's not a perfect repair kit, but I'm satisfied with the results - I didn't expect a perfect repair."
2,Not as good as hoped,"I used the product to ""repair"" a chipped almond sink. The patch material is in two pouches that are difficult to re-seal if you only want to use part of the quantity. the working and cure time are ok for the epoxy. I was not able to get a good match for my almond with the provided colorant. The prep procedure is a little tedious, but reasonable. the patch material went on reasonable well and seemed to cover the damaged area. It seemed to cure well within 24 hours. The major downside is that within a week rust streaks started to show though the patch.A great idea, just not right for my problem."
1,Missing items in the package,"I was not satisfied with this purchase. I got it. Opened it to repair my tub that is almond, and it only came with white repair. Dissapointed."
3,Epoxy bathtub repair kit.,"I read the reviews, carefully followed instructions both from reviewers and the manufacturer, and found it easier to apply than I had feared. However, I encountered two rather severe drawbacks. I purchased the white/almond kit, and used only the white, since my tub is glaringly white. Once you mix the epoxy into the white coloring, though, the color becomes a creamy yellow, which sticks out like a sore thumb in the middle of that expanse of white. I am quite bummed about this; it certainly ruins the appearance, however well it may have fulfilled its purpose in sealing a small crack.Secondly, nowhere in the instructions was I told that it was necessary to cut the selvage from the side of the fiberglass strip. I did not do so, and was left with a very rough uncomfortable surface, which I have tried to ameliorate with sandpaper.I would not have purchased this product had I known how unsightly it would end up being."
2,Not a great product,used this to fill a shower base crack. Worked great for three months and then started to peel off and turn yellow.Now I'm having to re-do it again. I followed the directions and it still didn't last. Would not recommend this product to fix a crack in a shower base.
4,Using Bath / Tub Epoxy Repair Kit,"The color and finish was perfect, the only issue I had was that you mix all the product in one go.Therefore if you need to give a second cover to a larger hole then you need another packet.But overall and excellent product."
3,Did not hold up very long,"The epoxy repair kit sealed our sink up for about one month, but did not hold up. We only ran a low pressure stream of cold water through the sink and the epoxy wore off quickly. It is not the best epoxy that I've ever used and at the time I bought it -- I thought that it was a bit pricey for what I ended up getting in return. I would not recommend this particular product for fixing a sink. It may be great for other applications, but not that."
3,"It works, results may vary","I got this to patch a factory defect(air pocket between fiberglass and inside shell caused shell to break) in a fiberglass shower/tub. The hole was about the size of 2 quarters, and was located slightly above the bottom on the sidewall.I only needed half of the included fiberglass, and a quarter of the epoxy.You have about 5 minutes before it becomes too tacky to work with, after that time the epoxy is still fluid and will flow downward if the patch is on a vertical surface. This will be a noticeable glob at the bottom that you can do nothing about.The Fiberglass included has one long edge that will bunch up and cause a ridge that can not be smoothed out, cut it off if you can.The White epoxy is somewhat transparent over the hole.It the end it is hard, glossy and functions, but it is ugly, and I will need to sand down the globs at the bottom, though there is really nothing I can do with the large ridge caused by the one edge of the fiberglass."
2,Review of a Shadow In The Forest,"I was deeply disappointed in this book. It reads like a graduate student's thesis; full of statistics and graphs. I guess this is o.k., if one is interested in raw data. But, as for the average reader, it might take some effort to complete it and not just ""skip through"" to the end, which is what I did.At the begining of each chapter, one of the authors tells an aluring story which captures the reader's imagination and interest, but the book immediately reverts to the same old boring statistics.This is a graduate study paper made into a book."
1,Annoying,"I honestly tried to like this one but I ended up hating this one too. I'm just not a fan of her videos. She's too perky for me. I felt like throwing a shoe at the TV screen every time she said ""Pump it up, Pump it up!"" or ""Wooooooooo!"" Nonetheless, I still find her fitness tips informative because she a respected fitness professional."
2,"It's NOT literary, although a fair read","Corson is brilliant at times, coming up with similes and situations that remind me a little of Hunter S. Thompson. But he's so intent on lecturing about his ""extensive"" knowledge of Hawaiian history, wildlife, and legends through the mouths of various characters that he loses points on characterization because they all sound alike! The plot was interesting but, for some reason, I already knew what was going to happen in almost every chapter, except for the Kohe part. The romance between Caddy and Starr was just left dangling at the end and I got the feeling that Corson himself was getting bored or under pressure from his publisher to finish up and start another book."
3,Not Exactly Hiassen or Leonard,"The author makes a valiant attempt to remind readers of the quirky and offbeat characters of Hiassen and Leonard novels, but doesn't quite pull it off. I never really cared what happened to the main character, Star."
2,Needs an editor,"I had this book for a class last spring. It is apparently one of the few books available on this subject so the instructor didn't have a lot of choices. The book is very poorly written. There are sentences in this book that are an entire paragraph long. An editor is needed to bring much of the list-type material into a table or organized bullet points.The point the author makes about the diversity of elders is well taken, but does it need to be repeated hundreds of times under every category? A special note to the author: Get an editor and listen to them."
5,The nihilism that isn't,"This book was fantastic in almost ever way. The plot was complicated and interesting. The characters a bit exaggerated, but solid. Motivations always lined up well with actions. And dig that authentic lingo!However, the best part of the book for me was it's virtual lack of any underlying moral judgment. Characters are shown as they are and their actions are presented without prejudice. No philosophical asides here. I found it extremely refreshing to be able to evaluate the morality of the characters without any sort of leading by the author."
3,"AWESOME CHARACTERS, BUT CUBA STORY LULLING AT TIMES","I really enjoyed this book at times especially the development and transformation of the characters Ward Littell, Kemper Boyd, and especially ""Big Pete"" Bondurant. I felt the weakest parts of the story were the excessive parts about the Cadre organization. The Outfit and Kennedy family story lines were more exciting, but I guess you can't write about JFK correctly without the effect of the Bay of Pigs. Clinton could learn a thing or two about how to use the power of the ""Executive Branch"" from ol' JFK. Littell, Boyd , and Big Pete were my favorites because to see them essentially switch personas by the end of the book was what kept me interested. I never would have guessed who turned out to the Badass connected man and who would have been the sentimental type. Not his best, but worth the ride!"
5,strap yourself in for a wild ride.,"""American Tabloid"" is James Ellroy at his nastiest and most compelling. The best living noir writer has honed his wordplay to frighteningly effective levels. Get ready for a wild trip through the late '50s and early '60s and leave the Kennedy mystique behind. This book grabs you on the first page and won't let you go. Reading this book requires some effort - there are seemingly hundreds of names, places and events coming at you at breathtaking speed. But hang in there; it's a ride worth taking. Ellroy's earlier Los Angeles books - ""The Big Nowhere,"" ""The Black Dahlia,"" ""LA Confidential"" and ""White Jazz"" - are intense reading experiences, but with ""American Tabloid,"" he has taken his razor-sharp style to its maximum. Where can he go from here? It's hard to imagine. But it will be great stuff, i'm sure."
3,didn't like it as much as I wanted to,"I loved Elroy's LA Quartet (The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential, and White Jazz), so was looking forward to this book and really wanted to like it, so much so that I read it a second time to give it another chance after not liking it much the first time.But American Tabloid doesn't work nearly as well for me as the Quartet, mainly because I bought into the noirish world of the first four books, but not into the interlocking conspiracies of American Tabloid. It was too over-the-top, and frequently seemed a parody of itself. How could Boyd, Littell, and Bondurant be in the middle of everything? American Tabloid also lacked the narrative drive and focus and the deeper characterizations of the Quartet. Elroy has written some of my favorite books, but this wasn't among them."
5,A favorite paragraph:,"From Lenny Sands' ""Hush-Hush"" dirt-digging memo:""Bing Crosby's drying out at a Catholic Church retreat for alcoholic priests and nuns outside 29 Palms. Cardinal Spellman visited him there. They went on a bender and drove to L.A. blotto. Spellman sideswiped a car filled with wetbacks and sent 3 of them to the hospital. Bing bought them off with autographed pictures and a few hundred dollars. Spellman flew back to New York with the DT's. Bing stayed in L.A. long enough to beat up his wife and then went back to the dry-out farm."""
3,Sloppy Conversion to Digital,The book itself is a fascinating and compelling read but the conversion of the text to e-book format was substandard. Many typos/misspellings throughout the text that I can't imagine would have made it into print.
4,An American Tabloid,"I HAVE BEEN READING ""NOIR"" NOVELS FOR SOME TIME. MOST OF THEM TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH.MANKELL, SIMENON, CAMILLIERI, PADURA, HAVE ALL CREATED THEIR OWN DETECTIVES CHARACTERS.I CAME ACROSSS JAMES ELLROY BY AMAZON O HEARSAY, AND READ AMERICAN TABLOID WHICH I FOUND FASCINATING IN THE SUBJECTS AND THE HANDLING OF REAL LIFE CHARACTERS INMERSED IN A DRAMA THAT STILL HAUNTS US NOWADAYS...WRITTEN IN AM AMERICAN WAY .PHRASES CONSTRUED MACHETE LIKE. CONCISE AND DIRECT TO THE ACTION. NOTHING SUPERFLOUS.GREAT WRITING !!"
3,Interesting but frustrating,"I enjoyed this book immensely for around 200 pages. Many of the characterizations, particularly Hoover and JFK, were dead-on, and Ellroy's perspective was compelling. About halfway through, however, the book starts to unravel. The plot becomes baroque and ultimately incoherent and the violence is so routine and excessive that it is ultimately cartoonish. In fact, I think it's fair to say that this book is essentially a cartoon version of Libra.."
3,Non-Fiction Novel,"A non-fiction novel mixing history with the characters that, I take it, Ellroy is practiced at evoking. Publisher's Weekly piously calls the history ""revisionist,"" reassuring us that nothing really happened that we need to worry about. In this environment, Ellroy's is about the best history we're liable to get."
3,Not his best.,"I agree totally with this comment: I enjoyed this book immensely for around 200 pages. Many of the characterizations, particularly Hoover and JFK, were dead-on, and Ellroy's perspective was compelling. About halfway through, however, the book starts to unravel. The plot becomes baroque and ultimately incoherent and the violence is so routine and excessive that it is ultimately cartoonish. In fact, I think it's fair to say that this book is essentially a cartoon version of Libra."
4,Good but just misses greatness,"Ellroy is certainly a master of his medium - that is never in dispute. However, this book is in daanger of losing the reader with all of the subplots and supporting characters. Also, the characterisation is a bit sketchy. Perhaps I'm rating more against what I would have expected as opposed to how good the book actually is. Again, as with all Ellroy novels - it's worth reading for the payoff and seeing each character trying to redeem themselves before it's too late. Not bad, certainly an interesting view of recent American history. Definately worth a read - but the LA Quartet was far superior"
2,Had To Give Up On It!,"When I first started reading American Tabloid I thought I was in for a real treat. However, after reading a few hundred pages, I started to realize I didn't care about the characters due to the one-dimensionality Ellroy gives them. Further, the plot, while moving at a fast-pace, was not well-developed and I was really tiring of Ellroy's writing style. While I pushed myself to read further(largely because I had already bought Ellroy's sequel to American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand), I finally had to give up on it after getting to the half way point. Now I have to see if I can exchange The Cold Six Thousand. I know many of you reading this review will be skeptical given the many very favorable reviews previously written about American Tabloid. The only thing I can say to this is if you feel you must read this book, take it from the library. Please don't waste your money like I did."
2,Every good writer is entitled to...,"...one poor book. And this is Ellroy's. Pretentious nonsense populated by one-dimensional psychopaths and their supposedly sophisticated, but actually incredibly silly, women. ""Love"" comes out of nowhere, at the drop of a hat. A weak-sister FBI agent begins a ""relationship,"" out of the blue, with a physically scarred girl who, up until that moment, had been his de facto niece. She writes him a note that begins ""School bodes."" School bodes?! And she cries the first time he touches her scars. Yuck! Give it a miss."
2,Too hardboiled for its own damn good,"This novel is fun for a couple of hundred pages, but Ellroy gets lost somewhere along the way. The plot took so many twists and turns that I decided to just go along rather than make myself seasick trying to keep the big picture in mind. One of the book's best points, the fact that it puts a human face on the mythology of the Kennedy era, is also a weakness: who cares what happens to these scumbags? Ellroy's perspective is interesting and his (near-)complete lack of moral judgment is impressive. It's too bad his self-indulgent badass style gets in the way; some sections are so clunky, they come off as self-parody. Still, if you don't let these things bother you, it's not a bad ride."
2,started off rather interesting...,"Started off rather interesting, but degenerated into absurd non-stop cussing and comic book-style violence. It seems that every paragraph or two people were getting their teeth knocked out and getting casually executed by the ""heroes"". I finally discarded the stupid thing when Super-Pete knocked out this guy's teeth, and then kicked him in the balls, just to ""test"" him, to see if he was OK. What a crock! This guy should be writing comic book story lines, or wrestling scripts for the WWF.I also strongly object to his falsification of history, taking real people and putting them into his fictitious ""docudrama"" to get their teeth knocked out...I was overly generous and rated it a 2."
3,history book substitute,The book is not bad even though it's boring sometimes. I prefer to learn the history from the fiction books than from non-fiction and then look up additional facts in the encyclopedia.
2,Disappointing,The book was long. The price too high. Six hundred pages of writing like this. I want a refund.
5,Excellent Book,"One of the best books I read last year. Ellroy is a master of the ""three-man structure."" We follow three main characters and how their lives intersect one another. Highly plausible JFK theory, although it doesn't assume to answer the questions of ""who"" and ""how"" the assassination is finally committed.Instead, we follow the assassination that almost was. Yes, the ugly event occurred, but in this story the men who are trying to bring it together -- fail. I think it was the of the reasons that the story succeeds on so many levels.One of my favorite Ellroy novels. It is extraordinary."
1,Tabloid trash,I heard an enthusiastic review on NPR calling it the best novel of the year! It is far from that. Even allowing for the subject matter (greed-violence-corruption) it is poorly written and only adds to our cynicism about our nation's recent history. I was very disappointed in the lack of imagination and poor handling of character in thiss tabloid novel.
2,I was expecting so much.....,"When I first picked up American Tabloid I expected the history lesson on the 50's and 60's that I didn't get in high school, instead I got something that is simply unreadable. The characters are exceptional and I found the progression of the plot to be good as well however the style of Ellroy is one that I have to admit I simply couldn't get past. I wanted to love this book but in the end it wouldn't let me."
4,Perfect title,"It reads like a long tabloid. I've never read any of Ellroy's books but I liked the movie LA Confidential. I had seen a program featuring Ellroy and didn't think much of him...but he can write. In this book there is a huge amount of violence/action, but so..so repetitious. And there are no good guys. Really. I kept putting it down, picking it up, putting it down... It's not horrible, but there's really nothing to reccomend it."
2,check your morals at the door,"This is a good book--if you're the kind who likes to stop and look at car wrecks. There's a murder a minute, and some multiple murders to make up for any minutes without one. I'm hardly a prude, considering ""The Choirboys,"" is one of my favorite novels, but this thing is loaded with gratuitous violence. The best novels are like long love affairs. This is a long, bloody road leading to nowhere, like a lengthy meaningless series of questionable, if not dangerous, sexual encounters with ugly people because you don't have the clout to rein in anyone better. the random madness can hardly be considered a plot, and you wouldn't mind if a nuclear strike took out all the characters in the book. I only gave it any stars at all because it was fascinating in its unbridled ugliness, and I had to keep slogging through to see what dead end lay ahead."
4,Wish it was here,"I heard that this is a good book, but since I never received it all I can say is that Amazon has let me down more than once.I hope your readers enjoyed reading my review."
1,"this is the wrong flag, IMAGE IS NOT CORRECT","hi, genius the EU flag has 12 starts in which ALL STARS FACE IN THE SAME DIRECTION"
5,Why wasn't History like this in High School?,"If history had been presented like this in High School I would have loved it! The information was presented in such an interesting and cohesive fashion it was a pleasure to read. It introduced history from different points of view instead of the traditional one we were taught in the 60's which focused primarily on the English. I learned so much about how Spain, the Dutch, and the French impacted Colonial America. Insights into Native American Indians, Slavery and even religion were compelling and certainly broadened my understanding of Early America as well as America now."
4,very good,"This book is excellent; the only book on colonial history you will ever need (although after reading it, you may be inspired to dig deeper). I wish more historians could write like Talyor. Only one small complaint -- I wish there had been more detailed maps."
4,Informative and Interesting,"This was a book that was used for a class titled, ""Colonial History."" It was a textbook. However, it wasn't written like a textbook. It was written like a novel. Which meant that it held my attention (mostly) and provided information that I did not know before. I got a B in the class but that was because of another book that I could NOT read.If you are reading this for fun, I think you will like it.If you are a student, don't dread it. It's really pretty good.If you are an instructor, please use this book. Much better than most!"
4,More of the same!,"The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend!"
1,Boring.,Boring book. Couldn't stay awake while reading it. It is very uninteresting. The author's writing style is boring and dull. I had to read this for my AP US History class and it is a complete waste of time...
2,Verrrry Dry,Verrrrrrrrrry Dryyyyyyyy book. Tons of info on every page. Very boring and time consuming. I HAD to read it for summer homework for AP US history and it sucked to be honest. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND unless you like getting bored to death with facts.
3,"Good history, but EXTREMELY biased.","This is a good history of the American Colonies, but it's so biased I want to tear my hair out when I'm reading it! He passes off his biased opinions against Christianity as fact, which, as a Christian, annoys me to death!!! He'll just classify Christians as being stupid imbeciles who wanted to kill everyone. Does he give a source for his ""facts"" about such things? No. Last time I heard, there weren't any historians who could read the minds of people who lived 350 years ago. THIS IS THE MOST LEFTIST AND LIBERAL HISTORY I HAVE EVER READ. Histories especially should be NON BIASED and written in a dispassionate tone, which American Colonies by Alan Taylor is quite passionate about trash talking Christians. Perhaps Alan Taylor should ask Jackson J. Spielvogel for advice on writing historical works."
5,A Love Story,"Little Sis inspires everyone to follow their dreams. It is adventurous, spontaneous, and sweet. Lives might have changed forever after you've read this book, but tears will fall, no doubt, when you get to the end. Tears from reading an awesome book! Billy, can't wait for the next one!"
1,Inspect your box,"I had purchased this product as a gift, which was just opened today. It is missing two of the larger knives. I am very dissapointed that this occured, make sure to check your box as soon as they arrive. Im sorry I didnt. =0("
4,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH THESE,"I BOUGHT THESE BECAUSE I WANTED TO REPLACE THE SET I WAS CURRENTLY USING MADE UP OF LITTLE BITS OF AT LEAST 12 DIFFERENT SETS ACCUMULATED THROUGH MOVES OVER 10 YEARS. I WANTED SOMETHING THAT MATCHED SO I LOOKED ON AMAZON.COM AND FOUND THESE. I CAN'T SAY THEY'RE THE BEST KNIVES I'VE EVER OWNED BUT THE LOOK COOL ON MY COUNTER. DON'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU, THESE KNIVES ARE WAY ON THE LOW END OF THE CHART WHEN IT COMES TO CUTLERY."
2,MADE IN CHINA!!!,"I shouldve looked and returned the set (i had already trown away the box and everything else).look at the stamp on the blade. it says MADE IN CHINA.there is NO WAY, to trace this material back to Germany. obviously, they dont (sure will not) provide an MTR for the material used to make the blade.I assure if it was MADE in china, the material also came from china, which they normally alter / lie about the materials (carbon content, Nickel content, Mg, Mn, etc...).This is now what I had wanted to have/purchase for my kitchen.can I still return them???I will try to contact the vendor."
4,Like,"I only got 11 of the knives, but they are shape and durable, I love the quality, I just wish they were all there!"
3,They're Sharp!,"The knives are sharp...I already cut myself...but the feel is ""cheeper"" than I expected. Price is okay too based on the more expensive sets."
4,Very Nice!,"I love these new knives. However, even though it says *Dishwasher safe--don't do it. Take really good care of these knives and they will last a life time. The chef's knife cuts through a lemon like butter...you will really like them."
2,What a disappointment...,"I purchased these knives hoping that they would be the quality that I expect from the Henckels name....NOPE! The handles are great...the blades are not. Mine are rusting and I have never put them in the dishwasher. Not one time. I am careful to wash them asap, just to avoid rusting, but it doesn't seem to matter.Truly a disappointment for the money spent."
3,13 Pieces?,"FYI, the 13th piece of the set is the block. I just bought this set and read some reviews before I purchased it that said they only got 12 knives or it was missing 2 large knives. Well, they were counting the block that holds the knives as a piece and the block has 14 slots, so when you get it and put all the knives in, you will have two unused slots for large knives, unless you have other knives to place in it, which could be a good thing. Otherwise it looks slick and they're really sharp, but I don't know too much about kitchen knives."
5,Nice set!,This is a nice set. It comes with all the knives you really need. They are pretty sharp. I love the handle. Very comfortable to use. It looks good in the counter. There are many more that are probably better but this does the job and the price is about right for the set.
1,Buy something else!,"This was a gift that I quickly became disappointed with. I had other Henkle knives that were great. This set has serrated knives that just performed poorly. Several steak knives quickly lost their pointed tips. Knives are not shiney. If the little man on the blade has one head, as this set does, it is Henkles International. My other Henkle knives, which I've had for years, have a double headed man. This indicates the real deal. Shiny metal that you can resharpen and use for decades."
2,Not Sharp,I have this set and I have never been impressed. They don't hold their edge. Thin and cheap. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,RUST! Beware,"good sharp edge. maybe a little too light in weight, so the balance is not great.One thing I am really annoyed about is that at least 4 of the knives had rust on the cutting edges after the first month of use!!! Really thinking about sending them back to Henckel (or Amazon) for my money back.If you have the money, spend it on the higher quality lines."
4,Great knives...but what is with the extra slots?,"I purchased 35 sets of these knifes for an event where they were used as centerpieces. Of the 35 sets, 12 of them were missing misc. knifes. Additionally, the knife block has slots for 13 knifes, but only 11 knifes come with the set. It is called a 13 piece set; however, the block itself and the sharpening rod are counted as part of the 13 pieces. Very misleading for the consumer."
1,"Ready to chop, without the proper knife...","Ok, I was so excited to receive the box containing my new knives. The photo showed a beautiful, complete set. What I received were 13 pieces with 15 slots. So, where are my two large, missing knives? I am so confused and unhappy."
2,Stylish but rusted!,"These knives work fine, and are certainly sleek and stylish in the kitchen, but the blades rusted after just a few uses. I cleaned them as directed."
2,Rusting Stainless Steel???,"I didn't realize stainless would rust, I own other stainless products that are 20 years old and they have never rusted, not one spot. After 1 week 4 of the knives have rusted. I should have known you get what you pay for as these are the low end Henckels made in China."
2,Henckels Fine Edge Synergy 13-Piece Block Set ok product,"Knives are sharp,I'll give them that and they look nice however kinda of cheap as made in china and not what I expected from Hennckle. One of the steak knife tips already broke off and if they are left wet they get rust spots quick.like I said and ok product, guess you get what you pay for..."
2,Not what I expected from this brand.,"I guess no matter what brand the saying you get what you pay for is true. My family has always used this brand of knives so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was wrong. These knives LOOK fantastic on my counter. They look sleek and modern. However, the knives themselves are just awful. They are not sharp at all. I have never seriously cut myself until I started using these knives. I have worked as a professional chef and have worked with the head chef of one of the best restaurants in the country so I do know what I'm doing and have good knife skills.Secondly, these knives rust! What kind of good knives rust? I do not put them through the dishwasher, I carefully dry them, and they still rusted. I was being very careful so I don't know what happened there. I am definitely replacing these as soon as I move. I reach for the knives I've bought separately every time I can. The steak knives are very useful as letter openers though..."
3,Good looking but not long lasting.,"Me and my husband received these knives as a gift for our wedding in July of 2005. We have had them for almost 5 years now. My overall impression of these knives is that they are a great looking set, maybe even a great starter set for some people like they were for me but, as others have stated they do tend to rust easily, they get dull pretty easily (after sharpening them they get dull within a week of use), over the past year the rubber on the handles has started to come off and crumble so, after 4 1/2 years I am looking for new set of knives."
2,I agree w/ J. Almand...NOT Henckels quality!! CHINA!,"These knives are not the quality of REAL J.A. Henckels knives!! To be quite honest I'm surprised they would put their reputable name on them! Sharp, yes but that's about where it ends. Two of the knives in my set were warped; e.g. you slice straight down and the knife veers off to one side! The chopping knives are not well balanced. Upon arrival the some of the blades had stains or blemishes. I will say the best feature are the steak knives..razor sharp and cut flawlessly."
5,The best money can buy,I am familir with Henckles Love the brand. They always stay sharp and even if it needs sharpening the tool comes in the block and belive me that is all that is needed. The company is true to its warranty when its needed.
1,Plumbing the depths,"My review is full of superlatives sadly all of them negative. It must be the most disappointing film I have seen in years. It is a must for anyone who wants to see how to take the most compelling themes of drama, justice, retribution, revulsion, that humanity can raise and then trample them in a travesty of poor research, wretched script writing, and one dimensional characterisation. Oh and I forgot -the most unbelievable European accents ever to be mangled by otherwise fine actresses. The only departments to acquit themselves well were the wardrobe and props which are delightfully 1970's kitch. Finally, though I do not know much of the American legal system, whoever heard of a potential witness of fact for the defence trying to double as a lawyer? It's stupid for the defendants and repugnant to the court and the profession. Viewing this film seems a waste of part of my short span on this planet."
4,An informative guide,"This guidebook is an excellent buy for anyone who wants to travel to Britain and/or Ireland without spending a lot of money. The book gives HONEST reviews of what to see and what to skip, as well as listings of budget places to eat and stay. The book's writers seem to have a sense of humor and are good at combining the factual and the entertaining. As for another reviewer's complaint that it contains no driving directions/maps--sorry, but most people on a budget can't afford to rent a car and pay for the expensive petrol (gas) in Great Britain! :-) Over all, I would recommend this book."
3,My expectations were too high...,"We have a dog and two small boys so our floors are always dirty. I was willing to spend almost $500 on a vacuum that would restore some order to our home. I am disappointed because it doesn't get my tile floors very clean. They still feel gritty after I've vacuumed. I also don't like the smell when I first turn the vacuum on and there is a really high pitched sound when the vacuum is running that isn't pleasant (kind of like a flourescent bulb that is about to go out). There is an amazing amount of ""stuff"" in the canister when I'm done so I guess I can't argue with that but I was hoping for more."
5,All I can say is Wow!!,"After reading the other reviews on this item I was hopeful that it would be as reviewed and advertised. After recieving the item fromAmazon today ""All I can say is WOW."" It is everything as advertised and works better than I had imagined. I have a long haired dog and 50/50 split of carpet and tile. After 20 minutes of vacuming my floors and carpet have NEVER been cleaner. This is one of the few things that I have bought in the last 10 years that have met and exceeded my expectations. If you are thinking that it is not worth the money, think again. You will not be wasting your money buying this product.."
1,Its Like Zappy Training Collar for a Dog!,I didn't find out that this machine constantly gives static shocks every time it is used until after I purchsed it from Amazon. If you don't mind feeling like a dog with a electric shock collar on or you truly don't mind the sudden and random jolts of static electricity then this machine is fine. I am amazed that they could even put this machine on the market without fixing this defect. Since my expensive and shocking purchaseI have gone to other online sites and found that this is a common problem. Shame on Dyson!
4,Best vacuum I've had ~,"OK, so there's not a perfect vacuum that fits everyone, so you just have to weigh the pros and cons of your choices. My con with this one is that it's just too heavy for someone my size.It's been used regularly for 7 yrs. without a problem but it hasn't been abused. If the dust bin gets full, it's emptied instead of letting debris pile up into the filter. It's wiped down before being put away. Several different people have used it without complaints other than getting used to the ""ball."" It still looks like new and I don't anticipate having to replace it any time soon.I have to give 4 stars instead of 5 because of the weight and not being self-propelled."
4,Best So Far,"We have owned or used very expensive vacumes ($1,000 plus) in the past, but this by far has been the best we have used. The first time we used it, we were amazed that the pattern in the carpet returned (actually I didn't know there was one). We have a Golden Retriever and needless to say we are amazed, every time we vacume, in the amount of hair it picks up. We have had this vacume since the beginning of April and use it no less than 3 times per week. I suffer from allergies and have seen my symtoms decrease in severity. If there is one thing I could change is the way you empty the container. I do not recommend emptying indoors or into a shallow bag because you still get the ""plume"" of dust. The container design is much better than other bagless vacumes, but there is still room for improvement (that is why I did not score it a 5 star). None-the-less, I recommend this and have offered any of my friends and family the use of it so they can see what I have been praising about."
4,Dyson Models,"(...) We have used the DC14 Animal on hard wood floors, leather couches, tile, and carpet and could not believe all 'stuff' that was in the canister.PROS DC 15 (opinion)The beater bar on the DC15 is rated better than DC07/DC14 modelsIt's lighter and easier to maneuverLooks coolCONSPriceOther reviewers have complained of wrist discomfort & rated customer service 7 on a ten point scale with 10 being 'best'.When purchasing, keep in mind the Dyson 'ball' vacuum is first generation for this product line. How will this unit respond over time? Anyone dealt with customer service on the 2 year warranty?Other brand attachments that cost less fit on the DC07/DC14. Attachments from the DC07/DC14 do NOT fit on the DC15. Humm."
2,wonderful vacuum for a jolly green giant with size three feet,"bought 'the ball' a week ago. it's heavy, awkward and doesn't vacuum under beds/chairs, etc - unless they're four feet off the ground. The stabiliser wheels are a bitch to operate, unless your feet are tiny - your toes get caught in the small space. the jolly green giant probably would find 'the ball' a doddle to manoeuvre - which it is if you're about 240 pounds. If you don't use the brushbar button, 'the ball' screams like a raptor in labour. But it doesn't lose suction. Not a sausage. My advice is:take weights training for six months or so, then buy 'the ball'. otherwise, it'll break yours."
1,Waste of Money,"I clean houses for a living, and I have used every kind of vacuum there is. All styles and brands. I have to say that this is the worst vacuum I have ever used. I have used both the ball version and the normal upright one. Although I dislike both, this is the worst of the two. This vacuum is way too heavy for the average women. Not only for carrying up stairs, but also for just pushing. After an hour of pushing this vacuum, my arm is very sore. I find the ball movement very akward too. It does not make movement easier in my opinion. It is a heavy, bulky, machine that is not worth the money."
5,I'm in love...,w/ my vacuum. This has to be the best purchase I have made this year. We have 2 dogs that shed a lot. I vacuumed our TV room with our regular vacuum and then ran the Dyson over the same area. I had to empty the canister 2 times! That is horrible...I had no idea that my house was not clean!Thank you DYSON!
5,This is one of the greatest albums in the history of rock!,"Scarecrow is the greatest band that ever existed. I know the bassplayer in the band. His name is Stephen Palmer, and I take lessons from him. HE IS A MUSIC GOD!! THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!! BUY IT!!! Along with Kings X, this is perhaps the only rock band left who makes music for the sole reason that a band should make music, becuase it rocks and they love to do it! Excellent Job!"
1,"Lost Treasure , Excellent Album !","I bought this CD as a recommendation from previous purchases that I made through Amazon. I really enjoy the concept of being able to do this because I am finding artists that I would never have heard of.In the case of Scarecrow this was a CD that I bought because it was cheap and it looked cool. There is no filler in this album at all. For fans of I Mother Earth, Freak Of Nature, Tuff's album Religious Fix, Saigon Kick and My Little Funhouse, Scarecrow's A Touch Of Madness is something you must own.All songs on this album are well written, hooky solid tunes.It's as simple as that!"
1,wire cracked within 1 month,"The replacement was not as good as the original which had lasted a long long time until it was abused. But having learned my lesson in what abuse not to subject the battery pack, I was much more careful with this one, and within 1 month the wire plastic coating cracked. Will see what I can do to complain. But for a little more than I payed for the battery pack, I could have gotten a new video player."
1,DANGER!,"We purchased this stroller with the Companion carseat as a travel system.The carseat's only attachment to the stroller is where it clips onto the food tray, and in ours the food tray did not fully latch into the stroller arms - but we didn't know that. We put our 11-day old infant into her carseat (strapped in, thank the Lord), put the carseat into the stroller and went for a walk in the park. Coming down a paved incline, the carseat, food tray AND MY DAUGHTER went tumbling, landing face down.I like many features of the stroller, but it should NEVER be used with the Companion carseat. BAD DESIGN - CARSEAT NEEDS ADDITIONAL SECURING TO THE STROLLER!"
1,too hard to use,"This stroller is very difficult to fold, and I envy the parents who have the one-handed gravity fold strollers. With a baby in one hand, there is no way to fold the stroller. Even with two hands, it's quite difficult. You have to jam it into the ground, which wears it out. Given that it's not easy to take anywhere, it's not worth owning. I would suggest you get a stroller that has an easy-fold option. This stroller can be bought for $65 on many websites and is discontinued. If you plan to keep the stroller in the garage and take it out from there (and never put it in the trunk or fold it), I'd say go for it. For $65 it's fine until you have to transport it. It steers well, but the wheels will need oil to stock squeaking. I do think that the brake bar is too near my feet so it's awkward to walk, however. This stroller has many glitches, and you could do much better."
2,I sold this stroller to get rid of it!,"I am one of those people who paid $150 for this stroller when it first came out. It's no wonder why Britax is not manufacturing this stroller anymore!It's a pain to open and close, it's big and heavy, and the storage basket doesn't stay in position which is annoying!It also squeaked when I used it on walks so I had to spray the heck out of the wheels with WD-40 to make it stop.It looked nice with the companion carseat but overall is just not what you would expect from Britax. Good thing I am not using the companion carseat anymore b/c I heard it can remove itself from the base in auto accidents. I now have the Decathlon which is descent.If you can get the forerunner stroller for like $50 bucks it may be worth it."
1,WHAT A MESS,"this stroller is a TOTAL MESS i feel sorry for the people who paid 180.00 then shipping and tax they totaled over 200.00 ooh how mad i would be, any ways i paid 64.99 so i dont mind its MANY problems this thing needs 3 hands and a chest to fold it 2 hands to pull up 2 leavers your chest to push it down and 1 more hand to fold the back of the seat i gave it 1 star because i paid 64.99 for it so if you dont need to fold it and you can get it for 64.99 go for it as others said i wont feel bad to replace it when iam done with the matching car seat"
3,"All-Star Cast, But Something's Missing","Intriguing and innovative plot involves the president of a large corporation seeking the perfect man for the No.2 job in his company by examining not only the candidates, but their wives as well. Starring Lauren Bacall, Arlene Dahl and June Allyson as the wives and Cornel Wilde, Van Heflin and Fred MacMurray as the husbands, not to mention Clifton Webb as the wealthy corporate magnate, the film should have had no problem scoring big. But something is missing. The plot is absorbing enough - who will finally be offered the big position? But there should be more zing, more sizzle, among these acting greats that just doesn't, for some reason, come off. One is left with the feeling that all these Hollywood big names had gathered for nothing but a grade B film that wouldn't be remembered. And it hasn't been. Too bad - it was a great idea."
4,Blades ARE Available!,"First...this is a tolerable saw. The cuts in typical molding (pine, birch, maple) are clean and accurate. There are preset cut angles that you must use (no moving it 1 degree). If you need a saw that can cut compound angles, this is not it. What this tool can do is give you much better and more accurate cuts than a cheapie miter box. With any saw, you need a sharp blade and finding a Stanley blade is impossible. Lee Valley stocks 22"" blades in 12tpi, 18tpi, 24tpi and 32tpi. You can find them online www.leevalley.com or you can call them at (800) 513-7885. They also sell more expensive miter boxes if you wish to explore that idea. This Stanley miter unit works fine for me as long as I keep a good blade in it."
1,Junque,"I debated getting this, but I did anyway...And after a couple of cuts, this ""saw"" is off to Goodwill.First of all, although the saw shows degrees of cut from 0 to 45 each side of the center line, you can only effectively use the limited number of preset (notched) degree settings. So unless you are making a 4, 5, 6, 8, or 12-sided item, you're out of luck. I needed to do 42 and 21-degree cuts. No dice.But don't worry, it won't even do a 90-degree cut correctly. The stock I tested it on did the 90-degree cross-cut OK, but it also added a 2-degree bevel. So if you-re planning on doing any work with stock much more than 1/8-inch thick, things will never fit together properly.This is probably due to the lame mounting of the vertical guide rods. The included allen wrench was make of metal so soft that by the time I finished tightening (finger tight only) the set screws for those guides, I had managed to put a 240-degrees of twist on the wrench.This ""tool"" is junk."
1,Plastic in all the wrong places,"I bought this stanley miter product to replace my Craftsman clamping miter, which I recently ran over with my car. Alas, Craftsman no longer sells this particular model anymore.The Stanley product is similar, only not nearly as heavy duty and has plastic parts at critical areas, such as the blade guides. (My old Craftsman was all-metal and endured lots of projects before it met its untimely demise at the hands of mr. goodyear...)Now, the blade guides can get torqued on with some significant forces. Bad idea to make these plastic. (I won't even mention the other plastic clamping parts.) In fact, the one I bought had these broken inside the sealed box. I suspect it was a return item . The blade guides simply won't last more than a few strokes, IMO. I will be returning this item. I'm willing to pay good $ for a good quality one, so I'll keep looking.Bottom line. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Save yourself a headache...don't buy this!,"Although Amazon promptly sent it off with free shipping and I was very excited to use this bad boy, it is simply not worth it. A very important piece of plastic(?)was broken right out of the box making the unit utterly useless. It simply has too many plastic pieces and is not built well enough."
1,Too many pieces of plastic - junk,Cannot use it much. The one of the plastic piece holding the blade broke off right away. I cannot even use it at all
3,Better the second time around,"As first received, the saw was unusable, as two black plastic saw holder/guides were broken.Stanley was prompt in mailing 2 replacement units, and the saw works just fine now.We feel the initial broken parts were likely the result of lousy packaging...inadequatebuttressing, with only minimum of loosely crumpled brown wrapping paper, and no bubblewrapor similar protection.Sum: good product, faulty packaging.CLFPoquoson, VaStanley 20-800 Contractor Grade Clamping Mitre Box"
1,Save your money,"I needed something just a bit more useful than my old wooden miter box, so I got this at my hardware store. I am a single woman with an old house and just the occasional project. I'm moderately handy, but this tacky tool just frustrated me to tears.1) I don't know for whom it is ""ergonomically"" designed, but its handle is cocked at an awkward angle and made my hand ache almost immediately. Trying to create eight cuts for a picture frame is a terrible struggle.2) I have used it for three (very small!) projects with soft wood moldings and the blade is already dull. I cannot replace it anywhere -- there just simply aren't spare blades.3. It is almost impossible to adjust off a simple 45 degree angle-- the cheap plastic base won't hold true.I ruined a picture frame trying to hack through it with this dull awkward tool. I'm saving my pennies now for a powered miter saw."
2,Not Suitable for Picture Framing,"I was looking for a hand miter saw for cutting simple 45 miters on picture frame mouldings. I purchased this model at Lowe's for $50. First thing I noticed was the ""cam"" clamps left indents in the moulding rails when enough pressure was applied to keep the wood from shifting while sawing. Second thing I noticed was it was nigh on impossible to get a square cut on small (1 inch) picture frame moldings. So the joins are not perfect enough to pass my standards. While a 1/64 inch gap on a 45 miter may be fine for carpentry, for picture framing the joins must be square, clean, and flawless. This product didn't do what I wanted it to do. I think the strange surfaces make it difficult to use clamps, the flimsy plastic parts have too much ""give"" to hold the steel parts steady, and the cam clamps are pretty useless."
4,BF Lives 2,Some compelling footage and eyewitness accounts in this documentory where Tom investigates sittings around the lower 48. A must see for any bigfoot fanatic and the production succeeds at subject and pase. I would have given it 5 stars but some of the background music was a little annoying.
3,A pretty cool way to show that you care,"In This movie Grams Recounts how an apple tree fed an intire villiage until greed distroyed it and Then in Lotsaheart's wish, Forrest Ranger Lotsaheart is tired of being a forrest Ranger and wishes for a more exciting job. By savin a unicorn lotsaheart gets three wishes with unexpected results."
5,punks origins are in 77....,"1377 that is.Ive only got the first version of this but its a wonderful album. It shows the roots of ""protest music"" through what we would consider old folk songs, it shows that people have always been struggling and gives a bit to chew on. Its great for fans of punk open-minded enough to accept that punk isnt just 1 2 3 4 and some screaming (which is good in its own right) as well as being great for folks who realize that Chumbawamba were much more open minded and intelligent than the punks who've cried sell-out have given them credit for."
5,Excellent Service,"I ordered the Thomas Kinkade Artist Lighthouse Beacon of Hope Mantle Clock for a Christmas gift. My friend said it's absolutely gorgeous and has it displayed on their fireplace mantle. The service was excellent, it arrived early and in perfect condition. Thank you."
4,Big men growling to big music,"If you're familiar with Crowbar, you are well aware of the brutality and anger underlying each and every song. Heavy, harmonic and steady, few bands accomplish as much with as few notes. If you are new to Crowbar I recommend picking up the self-titled copy first... one must see the progression the band has made to Broken Glass to appreciate it fully. There is nothing wrong with Broken Glass, however; I love it because it is so different than anything else in my collection. Buy Crowbar, any Crowbar, and revel in the pools of oily sludge oozing from your overworked amplifier. Heavy heavy heavy!"
2,Some missing original brother Jimi original cover tracks.,"According to the amazon. com CD track listing/s, 7 tracks exist.>Myself with friends hitchiked to Monterey, got to meet Brian Jones, bumped into 'Mr. Jimi', again for the second time. We were startled to watch Jimi play 'THE BEATLES' ""Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band."" ""Somehow"" 'Sgt. Peppers was not included on this 'original soundtrack' CD. HBO released a VHS ""Jimi Plays Monterey"" video. It's got the correct original performance + the usual insights and opinons from some of the intervews of other artists about Jimi's sudden rise then demise, a great loss for us all. Brother Jimi was from the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division, so a Veteran, respects overdue.Jimi was one of the nicest human beings I've ever met, still is.>apa_musica@yahoo.com> Honolulu, Hawai'i KH.>"
1,Very hard to get through,"I'm a fan of Alice Walker (read the Color Purple too many times to count) but this book was very hard to get through. If you are not familiar with the language that she uses it will take you a long time to get trough. I usually read a book in about three days, this one took me all on August."
2,New Age Hooey,"Starting with the positives, the book had interesting parts, was generally well-written & had a good heart. But what a lot of new age hooey. The lowest of the many low points was the section near the end about aliens who have been around for thousands of years in the form of snakes. Alice was clearly ingesting too many mind-altering substances. How did this every get good reviews from respectable publications?"
2,Not in her list of best.,"I have great respect for Alice Walker and have loved many of her books. This one I found hard to follow, unrealistic, and not very recommendable. I think she knew this before it came out, the dedication in itself is an apology basically stating that with all it's flaws it was time to publish the book anyway.In many ways I thought this book read like a memoir disguised as a novel. Maybe the exact retreats or experiences aren't the same, but she is clearly trying to impart information learned in retreat like settings in real life.The avid Walker fan will of course have to read this book, but if you haven't read her before, start with a different one to get a true flavor."
2,Not Nearly Her Best,"REVIEWNOW IS THE TIMEI usually love anything by Alice Walker, but this book bored me.I kept falling asleep trying to get into it. I took it back to the library after only making it to page 87.I wanted to like it, but I recommend any one of her other books in place of this one. It's too dry."
4,Following your heart,"I fully enjoyed following the journeys of Kate and Yolo while they were figuring out their place in this world, as we all are. This is the first book I have read by Alice Walker, and she is to be commended for writing an inspiring novel. This is a wonderful book for those of us who are ""soul searching."" I would recommend it to anyone who is contemplating or starting out on their own spiritual journey."
5,A Great Read!!!,"Rochelle Alers seems to create the perfect alpha male characters in her books. And Michael Kirkland is no exception. I mean honestly, what woman wouldn't want a man who is protective, with a little possessiveness, and a side of demanding nature (in a sexy way)and who is willing to give you anything your heart desires. Michael is mysteriously sexy and will always protect what belongs to him. Jolene was headstrong and career minded. She was very much into helping those who could not help themselves. These two made the perfect love story. And, the love scenes were steamy with a story line that was filled with suspence. This book was a great page turner."
5,Risking it all for love...,"Once again, Ms. Alers has taken romance and passion to another level with the second generation of Coles/Sterlings/Kirklands/Lassiters/Delgados.Michael Kirkland was all military like his father Joshua. Jolene was all business and a force to be reckoned with. Neither was looking for love -- that is until their eyes met across a crowded room. And then it was on!The intensity and the passion between Michael and Jolene practically burned through the pages and left me sweating, gasping for air and needing a cool drink. I hated for the book to end.Michael, Salem and Chris are the kind of men dreams are made of. Jolene, Sara and Emily are the women who can love them. Ms. Alers thank you for sharing your gift. Your words truly keep a hopeless and hopeful romantic -- hoping and waiting. Much respect!"
3,Okay Read,I am a huge fan of Mrs. Alers books. I waited a long time for Micheal Kirland's story which I was a little dissapointed. I thought the story was dragged out to long and they fell in love to quickly. It was to much over the top but toward the end I thought it picked up a lot. What's the deal with the heroine always tall and slim some of them sound anorexic. Although I didn't care for this book I will continue to read Mrs. Alers books and recommend them.
1,Living under the old creation,"The author wants us, christians, to live under the old creation dispensation. The Bible clearly teaches that we must not keep saturday, which belongs to the old creation. Colossians 2:16s: Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ"".Paul wrote against the judaizers: Galatians 4:10 ""You are observing special days (=saturday) and months (new moon)and seasons (=jewish festivals) and years (= sabbatical years)! I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you"".We celebrate the 8th day, the Day of the Lord, not the saturday, because we believe Jesus brings the new creation. Blessed be God that this book won't deceive most of christians."
2,Whole thing runs small,"I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO."
5,nice,"I like the fabric they use to make this product. my husband enjoys when i wear it also, it came on time. Thank you"
2,Very Disappointing!,"If you like processed rhythms and weak transitions, along with a very political stance that could have been stated in one song, then you will enjoy the menial effort by the boys. I'm a huge fan since the release of ""She's On It"" and have supported them in all their previous work. But this release really must be for the record company's best interest- where's the usual creative genius of the jazz mixes, musical depth or even a single unprocessed instrument? Don't get me wrong- the 2 stars are for the mastery of lyrics (as always), the skills that pay the bills, and the thumping bass, but I reserve the other stars for what I know they are capable of producing. Buy the record, but don't expect LTI, PB or CYH. Those days are long gone, and not for the better..."
2,So so,"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this album. It sounds like they went back about 8 years in time and branched off from there. It doesn't work for me."
4,"more party as in ""the democratic"" than ""an off the hook""","Listening to ""Ch-Check it Out"" all over MTV2 and college radio, you can't help but rock the hell out, but after the first track, you'll quickly learn it isn't the party ""Ch-Check it Out"" seemingly promised. With much more subversive beats than the single, ""To The 5 Boroughs"" is definitely more lyrically driven. After a couple of listens though, you'll start to glean your favorite tracks and enjoy the hell out of them, and (assuming you're a liberal) will appreciate the entire album's lyrics as relevent political gospel, one that succeeds without naming too many names or getting down on itself."
3,Mediocre effort compared to their other CD's...,"Now I love the beasties, but Boroughs is a mediocre CD, compared to Ill Communication & Check Your Head.The lyrics sound contrived, and the political messages lack subtlety.This album is shorter than their previous efforts, and there aren't any tracks that really stand out.Compared to other CD's out today, i'd give it 3 stars. But by beasties standards, this is a poor effort. :("
3,Not Like They Used To Be,"I've listened to the Beastie Boys for quite a while now, and this CD just doesn't measure up to most of their other ones. The music is pretty dull except for Ch-Check It Out, which is the first song on the CD. The lyrics on the other hand, have the same classic Beastie Boys style. This CD isn't bad, just don't get the explicit lyrics version. I won't get mad at a couple of cuss words every now and then, but f*** popped up every 5 seconds.In short, get the CD, if anything just for the first song!"
4,The Boys are back... and never lost it!,"If you don't like the Beastie Boys, this probably isn't the CD you should start with. But if you're more than 15 minutes old and have been a Beastie fan, this album is no disappointment! Retro bass hooks with goofy rap and sound clips is what this album's all about. It's no Paul's Boutique or Ill Communication, but this is definately a must-have for your collection."
3,A Low in the Beastie's Career,"When the single ""Ch-Check it out"" was released, I couldn't wait for the Beastie's new album to come out. Now, after buying TT5B and hearing all of the songs, I must say that I'm quite dissapointed.The songs don't follow the Beastie's old style that most of us have come to love. The lyrics are tired, as well as the backbeats, which, for the most part, sound like they were made by a bad Techno DJ.The songs do tend to grow on you, but ""To The 5 Buroughs"" is nowhere near as good as the Beastie's 5 other studio albums.Excuse me while I go listen to my copy of Paul's Boutique..."
5,Turn this motherf*ckin party out...,"I've liked the beasties since i was in elementary school and i own all their cd's and i wasn't disappointed by this, in fact i was impressed. It's old school, good beats, good rhymes, good times. I was compelled to write a review in response to whoever gave it 3 stars because the Beasties weren't catering to their republican fans' viewpoints. Artists are going to speak their minds when they find it necessary, and if you don't like it, you don't have to listen. This cd rocks very very hard, no complaints here..."
2,What happen to the party!!,"What the . . . What happen to the party? The Beasties used to be unique and transedent of time and relative current events, now they are nothing more but another c average political science major. Their raps are nothing new. The protests have all been rapped before. Their beats are uninspired, and even though at first hint old school, that's just an excuss for nothing inventive or new. The Beasties inventive side is gone in this lackluster affair. I suggest Paul's Boutique or any other Beastie Boy album before giving this boring disc a spin."
1,Disappointment.,"I was so excited when I pre-ordered the new album 4 months ago. Then I got it yesterday. What a disappointment. First of all, they do not play instruments at all. Second, none of their songs have a chorus. And third, they need to bring Hurricane back. There is nothing original here. It sound like just another rap album. Very sad for a fan since 1986."
1,This album is horrible,I can't believe this is the best the Beasties can do after 6 or 7 years. All their albums have been awesome and they have never let me down. BUT THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!! The lyrics are terrible and their attempt to go 'Old School' has flopped. They definitely sound old though. The only half-decent song is RIGHT RIGHT NOW NOW. the rest is garbage. B-boys are my heros and I gotta admit is heartbreaking to listen to this dismal record.
2,"I want music, not a message!","This album is nothing but an anti-Bush soap box. I know other artists do it, but I never thought the B Boys - one of my all time fav bands - would put so many politics into their album, it's really bad. Second, most of the songs are just awful. Usually on every B Boy album I liked the majority of songs. On this album I only like 2 or 3 of the songs. Really, it's not worth buying. Just download the few good songs from iTunes or something. All the politics have got to GO. I want MUSIC, not a message."
3,stop trying to change the world.,pick up the new afroman.. its a much better buy. join the streetteam on his website
2,The heck?,"Is this a Beastie Boys album or did some 15 year old sit down with a Mixing program, the lyrical tracks and some ripped off, cruddy Hip Hop backdrops?I don't even give a flying monkey about the politics. It's like... something that someone who enjoys media will have to endure for the rest of eternity now, but this is just... generic.I think the BB's have forgotten that MC's are a dime a dozen, even when they're some of the oldest and most revered MC's in the game."
1,what the heck happened?,"Every Beastie Boys CD earned my approval until this piece of trash came along. I expected to love it, but in reality I rather hated it. The main problem is the lyrics, which suddenly are unbelievably terrible. Their lingo on here sounds like things a sixth grader would come up with. They took a huge turn for the worse here, and it's quite obvious why the Beastie Boys ended their career after this album came out. The only good track is ""Triple Trouble"". ""Ch-Check It Out"" has no reason to be a hit because it's so awful."
5,bush fanatics,"thank god we have a band fully supportive of the bush administration. I especially liked the lyrics "" to be a democrat is to be a silly rat "". This will be good back up to destroy the Kerry campaign."
2,We can think for ourselves...,"The Beasties are not political figures. I don't care to hear their views about a world that they don't really live in. They live high on the hog and to me seem a little naive, don't they realize all three put together pay more taxes that some small Iowan town. They should be trying to keep their money in their pockets instead of giving more, which is what Kerry's plan calls for. Same old Beasties for the beats and mixes. That's worth a listen to, but the lyrics pretty much kill the album. Remember Beasties the youth that fell in love with you are now 30 or so and making middle income wages!"
1,C-can we try using real words...,"Oh c'mon...Nothin that involves 3 old white guys rapping can possible be good music. the people who enjoy this cd are the high-school white boys who tell everyone they LOVE rock music but lock themselves away and play ther old snoop dogg records...honelsty, who do you think your foolin? not me... y dont you all just drop the act and relize that this isnt music! if u want good music ill be waiting for u in the pop/rock section! BEYONCE ROCKS!"
1,What is it with these fools....,"You know maybe it is just me but I always found the concept of jewish kids rapping to be a joke... These 3 are pathetic, all they do is take turns shouting nonsense.... It is a barometer as to how far american civilization has declined and these hams are listed under ALTERNATIVE MUSIC....PLLLLEASE.... And now they rap about how bad bush and the war is.... and they are JEWISH AND THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAR HUH!!! Very trendy thing in h-wood and the music biz to slam Bush... They should take a walk in Iraq and see what it's like to get taken hostage.... Yea...."
2,I think that 2 stars is being generous,"The Beastie Boys have finaly lost it. The quality of their albums have gone down hill since check your head.(although Ill communication has some really good cuts) I think they stopped making worthwhile music when the quit using drugs. This CD has too many political statments on it. I don't care about their political views. When I listen to Rap music I want to either hear about ""partying"" or ""thuggin"". I don't want to hear about how they think that the President is doing a bad job. It's not like any of them have a masters degree in political science or anything. Infact I would be surprised if they have anything other than a GED. Enough doggin' the B-boys... If you really want to purchase a good disc I would reccomend Paul's Boutique. That is one of my all time favorite CDs. Check your head is really good too."
1,Country Music Is Better Than Rap!!,"I get made fun of a lot for listening to country music and Japanese techno. People tell me to listen to rap and rock music. One of the people I know at school listens to rap and rock music and he told me that the beastie boys were good music. I dont know about that! There music dosent make a twanging sound like country, so it scares me! I love Toby Keith though! I have one rap album and that is the Baha Men, that is good music, just like Toby Keith! I get made fun of alot, but I love my music, country and japanese both!"
1,They hate America,"Why don't they move to France? I am appalled that today's youth seems infatuated with the Beastie Boys and I fear how that will effect the future of this country. I'm just glad that no one over 20 takes these chumps seriously. I have nothing against so-called rap music, in fact I consider myself a woman of color at heart. But these guys are whiter than Pat Boone and are sending a message that the United States are unfit to live in. Shame of them."
1,White is not the color of rap!,"What happened to the Beastie Boys?! I hate punk and heavy metal and mostly even rock, but that's what they used to be! They're white!!!!!!! They are also rapping!!!!!!!!! If you don't know me, my name's Gerad Dunn (G.D.) and I hate it when white guys goin' RAP! I'm the white rapper cop, kind of. I'm just sick of it. STICK TO YOUR OLD WAYS, BEASTIE BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--------G.D. signin' off"
1,Just terrible!,"They sucked back years ago what I did I expect now? First ofall, it's already known that rap sucks. These oreo's only makematters worse. These guys should have been out of the pictureyears ago."
2,Its worst crime? It's boring,"To the 5 Boroughs proves that the further away that the Beastie Boys move from Paul's Boutique, the album I think they peaked with, the less interesting they become. I had a lot of expectations for this new album but I came away bored by this. Rote lyrics combined with a drum machine make this very uninspired effort."
1,Even the Dali llama thinks it stinks,It's time to call it a day home boyz. This just is not happening bros.
4,The Beastie Men.,"I've found this album to be just as good as I hoped it would be. It's not the best ever, but it's a solid release from these 3 guys, and it's great to hear them again. Unlike ""Licensed To Ill"" and ""Check Your Head"", there's almost no rock or punk on ""To The 5 Boroughs"", it's just strictly great hip-hop and good samples. Some lyrics get a bit political as others have said, but I don't mind that since they're still delivered in that ""Beastie"" style. Not every track is a winner, but ""Time To Build"", ""Rhyme The Rhyme Well"", ""Triple Trouble"", and ""An Open Letter To NYC"" all make up for that. Overall it's great hip-hop, and definitely better than ""Hello Nasty""."
3,"They're talented, but semi-entertaining","""To the 5 Boroughs"" is a great CD, don't get me wrong, but there's nothing new or freshly impressing. The whole time, the Beastie Boys' perfect rhymes flow over MixMaster Mike's skilled turntable old skool beats. ""Check it Out"" stands out on the album, so does ""An Open Letter to NYC,"" but the rest seems to blend together. That's not a bad thing, though. The Beastie Boys have a way of pulling off stuff like that smoothly. Secondly, the album seems more like teh soundtrack to that new movie ""Farenheit 9/11"" at times. The boys bash George W. Bush and his decisions in probably 3-5 songs, slurring out that it's time for a re-election. I bought the clean version of this CD and after a few listens... there basically was no serious foul language. They say ""F**K"" like 3 times, they say ""ass"" once, ""S**T"" only pops up twice and there's a couple of ""damn""s and ""Hell""s. Otherwise, this CD isn't very ""explicitive."""
3,Get's better and better,"This album is a good time. If you care about someone makin' a stink about the war then you should go find some Perry Cuomo. Rock/Rap should always be stickin' it to the ""MAN"". Buy this and any P.I.L. cd and get to hating your parents.Go vote, but don't vote for either Bush or Kerry.Oasis still SUCKS!"
1,beats can only hold you attention for only so long,"Well in the overall scheme of things, the Beastie Boys are back to making rap songs that seem to entertain little purpose. They've harnessed all their creative energy into ruining okay beats. Maybe I'm ignorant to their message but every song I hear by them seems to have none. They just say whatever they can to establish a ryhme. Sometimes the lines are ironic or odd but mostly ignorant. And some of these reviews say they make gangsta rap. Three White Jews don't make Gangsta Rap. And unbeknown to a few, they are extremely talentless where their shelf life wasn't meant to survive past 1989"
4,"I would give it 5 stars, but....","This is great listen, no doubt, But I listen to vaious music so that I can avoid the grind of and especially politics. Leave the politics to the politicos and I promise they will not try their hand in music (thank god) and leave the entertainment to the artists. They are the last thing I want to use to ""understand"" politics."
1,Where are the Beastie Boys?,"Wow, have these guys fallen, this is by far the worst Beasties Cd (and I own all of them). Most of the tracks are just flat out annoyingly bad (""Check It Out"" is good? C'mon...) The song ""an open letter to NYC"" tries to suck up to the 911 tragedy, nice try boys but next time why dont you release a song like that sooner. This CD is very very old skool beatish but it's lacking that Beastie edge from all of the previous CD's. Guess the grey hair is getting to them, time to retire boys if you going to produce more schlock like this, I want my money back."
5,Well worth the wait!,"6 years after Hello Nasty we FINALLY get a new Beastie Boys album. I couldn't be happier with the results. The Beastie Boys have given us a pure hip-hop album that isn't bogged down by layers of sound. Some people might call it too simple, and uninspired. I call it genius. It sounds old school, and the B-boys have shown that they still have it in them to lay down some awesome rhymes. This album puts the spotlight on their talent as rappers, rather than the production value. The beats are wicked, you'll never hear better beats on a Beastie Boys album.They get political too, and keep up with the times. The best track on the album is probably ""An Open Letter to NYC"" Its a sinister sounding track about post 9/11 New York. Other highlights are ""Right Right Now Now"", ""It Takes Time To Build"", and ""Triple Trouble""All in all, this may very well be the best album the Beastie Boys have ever made, and although it took them 6 years to get this out to us, it was worth the wait."
2,Disappointed Longtime Fan,"Some of us have been through years where the Beastie Boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players (that's cassette tapes, in case you are too young to know). Anyway, I was hoping for another album that would stay (now in my 5-disc changer) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out. Unfortunately, this is not what I got in this album. While there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the Beastie Boys of old, too much of this record feels like preaching. Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.Truly, there are some great songs on this record. But if you listen to this album and then to Paul's Boutique, Licensed to Ill or another great one, you will quickly realize that this is not the Beastie Boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century."
2,through the Motions&average,this is the kind of album the Beastie Boys could do in there sleep.they are without a Doubt One of the Most Creative Forces Ever in Hip-Hop Music but this Album seems tired&contrived.going through the Motions&Lacking any real edge.they have moments here&there but it doesn't merit a wait of 6 years.
4,"good condition, bad CD...","I've heard a few songs from this album I liked, so I thought i'd try it out... I couldn't finish listening to the whole thing. This doesn't sound like the beastie boys. They got really political sounding on this album... I wouldn't really recommend it...But the cd was in great condition, So i'm in no way blaming the store owner. I blame the B-boys for this one."
3,Respect for the Beastie Boys but not their best cd by far,"I like the Beastie boys but this cd is just disapointing, the mixes are bad man sounds like it's all been just thrown together the day before the release."
2,Do not buy this CD,"Don't get me wrong, the music is - okay. In a time when everything has become political, the Beastie Boys are no different. I was looking for a piece of entertainment, perhaps even a throwback to some good 1990's times, but instead I got political CD. If I want a political message, I'll read the paper or watch CNN.That's isn't even what pissed me off the most. I attempted to play the CD in my computer, only to find that Capitol records has placed a block that disallows this CD to be played in any Desktop or Laptop. You may read more here:http://www.gnutellanews.com/article/12729I don't have (and can't afford) a fancy home theater, so I have to play my CD's in my computer for some good sound. This is my first CD purchase in awhile - and I regret it."
2,Weak... Doesn't it seem like they've been downhill for years?,This review will be short and sweet.The only song I like is Right Right Now Now.The rest... it's like... I can't even explain how bad it is...
1,What happened??,"This cd should have a colon in the title . . . To the 5 Boroughs: (Circa 1985).Ok, maybe that is overstating the case a bit, but this album sounds like it should have directly followed Paul's Boutique. Lacking any of the funk and real instrumentation of the amazing Check your Head and Ill Communication, this cd is a collection of raps over boring drum machine beats. Yep it's ""old school"" but not in a good way. Although some of the sounds are new and interesting, the raps sound like recycled 80s rap and/or previous Beastie Boys tunes.I'll keep giving this album a chance but I'm starting to think this is one of those albums where your first impression is dead on. If you really liked Paul's Boutique you may like this album (I'm not a huge Paul's Boutique fan but there are some real jems on that album and enough solid tracks to warrant keeping it around; 5 Boroughs lacks any true jems).What happend? Where's the funk? Where are the instruments?"
4,Excellent!,"While some consumers are mixed about this album, I tend to agree with the critics. This album is definitely better than average and it is a different sort of rap/hip-hop than all the gansta/east/west coast rap out now. While I don't always agree with the Beastie Boys political views, I love the fact that they include such political allusions and such into their work. Also, the simplicity of the production is a plus in this setting. My favorite songs are ""Ch-Check It Out"", ""Right Right Now Now"", ""Triple Trouble"", ""Hey F#@$ you"", ""Rhyme the Rhyme Well"", and ""3 The Hard Way"" among others. 4 1/2 stars for the ""FRESSHHHH"" Beastie Boys!"
4,True Hip Hop,"This album, while not as varied as previous Beastie adventures still is great. It is easily better than the trash out there in the world of hip-hop and rap these days. The Beasties, who have obviously aged quite a bit, are much fresher than any of the kids who are popular today. This is a great record, it isn't quite Paul's Boutique it is still amazing."
1,what the hell happened?,"since when did the beasties start singing about political topics? And even if you don't pay that much attention to the lyrics the sound of this album just isn't that good, like they spent to much time trying to get their political messages across and not nearly enough putting the music together, but what do I know? .. This CD just does nothing for me and I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
1,All of the tracks,This whole anti-copying thing is getting crazy. The first 9 tracks will not play in any of my players. We'll see if I can return.
1,"politics and entertainment - oil and water, disappointing","I love the beastie boys...i think i've listened to their older stuff over and over again since I was 10...but this CD is pathetic...people complain about seperation of church and state...how bout seperation of entertainment and state? I'm all for freedom of speech, but don't sell a CD citing it as ""entertainment"" when it holds a clear political agenda.Lets assume there are no political messages. I'd still rate it 1 star. EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME. There is no varaition which the Beastie Boys have been so well known for. Where are the rhythmic instrumentals that last for minutes on end? Where is the innovation in musical style that had, previous to this album, been their hallmark? Seeing as how they had years to develop this album i'm rather disappointed.If this is in anyway a hint as to what future Beastie Boys albums will sound like, you can count me out."
1,IM Sorry,yea this is the worst rap ive ever heard in my life!!!its so god d*** annoying!! ch chh ch check it out!! uhhhhh its so annoying!all the other songs suck too the only good white rapper is eminem! im sorry but this is garbage!definatly dont buy this one!this belongs with your bananna peel from 2 weeks ago....in the garbage! i mean cmon the clean version???nothing silly? thats so stupid! yea...you see the NO button under the review? knock urself out
1,BOR-ING,"I tried to like this, I really did. But there's nothing to like. The lyrics are boring, the music is boring, and the whole thing is repetitive..and, well, boring. What can I say? The only thing I really enjoyed was the one beat of silence in between tracks. This would make a really good coaster--other than that, I've no further use for it. What a waste of money. If I could, I'd award it no stars at all (and get my money back, too!)"
4,Solid Buy,"I have never been a big listener to the Beastie Boys, I mean, I have many of their MP3's on my computer, but i have never bothered to buy an album. I heard Ch-Check it out on the radio and had to have this album. I wasn't dissapointed. My only problem is that they dont have any instrumantals or jazz like songs. But its a solid hip-hop album with some of the best raps i've heard in a while.Right now stand-out tracks for me are ""Ch-Check it out"" ""Right Right Now Now"" ""Time To Build"" ""Triple Trouble"" ""Thats it thats all"" and ""We Got The"" I think my favorite right now is ""Oh Word?""Overall if you're not into hip hop, this album will probably still appeal to you. Beastie boys have a style all their own. The only rapper right now who reminds me of them is SA from 311."
1,An expensive drink coaster!,"I can't see how anyone can like this, unless flat and boring is your thing.It's kinda funny: when Licensed To Ill was released it was the BBoys joking around and it turned into a gem. I assume they are taking themselves serious on this one, and it turned out a clunker.How can a band have such a great string of awesome music and then release this piece of junk followed by their latest release: Mix-Up (more junk).If the BBoys were playing baseball, they would've switched to DH long ago. Instead these guys are still starting, and at best hitting the Mendoza line.Retire while you still have some pride, unless you think selling corny music for lots of money is cool. I don't. Some poor sap bought my trade in."
1,not simon and garfunkel,what has happend is we have an album that is strickly a love affair with Republicans. Listen to the lyrics. Sounds like my car starting up with teenagers reading foul nursery rhymes. I will have to stick with Neil Diamond.
4,Same old Boys but........,"Awesome music on this CD, but there are no instruments! No guitars! I liked their older guitar hip-hop crap, but this is still good Beastie Boys material. Plus all that Bush bashing makes me sick.......... they're not polititians!!!!"
3,Not Bad,"Its a mediocre album. Not bad compared to whats currently out there. However its a little weak, I was expecting better."
5,Awesome.,"I just purchased this CD about 30 minutes ago. I listened to about the first 10 tracks, then came on here to look at the reviews that people were giving it. I'm so surprised that so many people have given this album 1-Star Reviews. (...)? The beats are great, the lyrics are alright (Just like any Beastie Boys CD). The political points of view are their opinions. Just because you don't agree with it, doesn't make the album bad. So far, there are only 6 copies of this CD used for sale on here. If you don't like what they have to say, get rid of the CD.If you're (...)about the copy control, get over it. Search under your couch cushions for the $12 and go buy the damn CD instead of burning it off of your neighbor."
3,Good album but my least favorite Beastie allbum,"While it is refreshing to hear an album that is so old school, all of the songs begin to blend together and it sounds like one long track. I liked the way the Beastie's always blended rap, punk, funk, rock, and just about whatever else they could get their hands on. Despite this, this is great album to listen to while driving and has some very enjoyable songs, including the heartfelt 'An Open Letter to NYC' and the extremely old school 'Triple Trouble'.Also, the politics on the album can be a little overwhelming. Whether you agree with them or not (and I generally do), how interesting will it be to hear them bash Bush five years from now? On the other hand, you can always 'Fight for Your Right to Party' or listen to something mindless and catchy such as 'Sabotage' or 'Intergalactic'."
3,B-boys are awesome! But Politics dilute it!,"Once again the Beasties defy formula and come out with a unique and interesting sound. My favorite is song #6 Triple Trouble.Unfortunately, their political views tarnish the quality of the album. I'm not being critical of what they are saying (nothing profound is said). Nor do I care what their political views are (I would be just as annoyed if some of the tracks supported Bush or bashed liberals).This album feels close in some ways to Paul's Boutique (although not as dense), but won't stand up over time like that one. Overal this is an average album. I will probably just take the 5 or 6 good songs and add them to my BB mix cds so I don't have to listen to the others."
2,Decent Album DRM copy protection.,"I just bought this album and it has some great sampling and licks. It has a terrific variance of sounds with great layering. You can tell they had a lot of fun making this album.However, it is DRM encoded, so you cannot copy it to your MP3 player to listen to while you run, or your car's MP3 player to listen to while you drive. Fair use!? Evidently, its not their concern. All I know is (...) the record label is going to tell me how and where to listen to it!? I can understand Lars pulling crap like this, but Mike D!? Free Tibet!? How about FREE MY MUSIC!!!"
1,Tired and Tedious...,"It's not the Beasties' neo-commie politics that bother me - keeping the world safe for terrorists is certainly the cause du jour for all entertainment industry types, not just these 80's relics.It's just that this CD is uninteresting lyrically and musically. In other words - monotonous and boring.As other reviewers have suggested: if you must buy this, pick it up used."
1,Another $12 coaster!,I would only recommend this album to those that want to know The Beastie Boy's latest politcal views.
4,It's been six years . . .,"Ok, f--- you to the people who say this album is annoying. It is pretty obvious that you haven't listened to too much of the Beastie Boys. And if you've ever been to a live show you would realize that the political agenda is important to them.Now for the album. it has been six years, but they are finally getting back to their roots. Sure Ch-Check it Out and Triple Trouble are great, but the meat of the album is not found in the good, albeit somewhat superficial radio tracks.If you are into the Beastie Boys that we all grew up with, buy this album, the form hasn't changed a bit."
2,Missing cd booklet,"The booklet that goes in the front of the cd was missing, the seller didn't mention that, and really wasn't in that good of a condition."
2,Monotonous and Forgettable,"I'm not a big fan of Beastie Boys. I like them more for the music they sample and humourous lyrics. These are missing on To the 5 Boroughs. The samples are mostly of other rap artists and lack soul. There are no dense layers of samples as used on Hello Nasty, Ill Communication and Check Your Head. All we are left with is the Beasties themselves which isn't that interesting. The lyrics aren't nearly as funny or interesting either.The music is monotonous and forgettable. For completists only.[DW]"
3,Where are the hooks? It's no Paul's Boutique.,"Lyrically, it's excellent as always.Musically, it's lacking. To me, it's missing great hooks. Without knowing anything about this record before I bought it, I couldn't figure out which track they were going to release as the single. So far, it's had a mere two spins through in my deck. I'm trying to like it, but it's just not doing it for me so far. I wish the Beasties would fork up some royalties for some samples and make more music like they did on the masterpiece Paul's Boutique.Technically, it's not even a true Compact Disc, and you won't find the official CD logo anywhere on this disc. It's considered an 'enchanced CD'. But it's an enhancement that I could do without. They've employed some anti-piracy software and techniques that try to auto-load onto your PC. No thanks. Note the others that have had difficulty playing on their PCs. I think this unmentioned fact is shabby, and both the Beasties and Capitol deserve the backlash they're getting."
3,"Not bad, but not worth a six year wait.","If you liked the last few Beastie Boys Cds you should like this as well. Pretty standard fair for the Beasties. A bit of old school flavor dedicated to New York. A solid if not too exciting release, but still infinately better than m&m or d12 or any mid-west or southern crap, I mean rap."
3,B-Boys and politics? You may NOT want to CH-Check It Out!,"I agree with a few earlier posts. I am a big Beastie Boy from way back and I was really excited when this album came out and this album definitely has a few great moments like ""CH-Check It Out"", ""All Lifestyles"", ""Rhyme The Rhyme Well"", ""An Open Letter to NYC"" but some of the other preachy departures and references to ""Columbine bowling"" quickly diminish and date this work. Throw in a few songs like ""Crawlspace"", ""Hey F*** You"", ""Time to Build"", and ""Shazam!"" that in the old days would have been to end up as b-sides and you end up with a diappointing addition to your B-boy catalog. Most songs on this album just seem to fall short of what the B-boys use to produce. Perhaps its their growing older or they are just too distracted nowadays with other endeavours. My advice to B-boys if they were to put out another album is to focus more on the music and lyrics and leave out the preachy politics."
3,Allright......,"I bought this CD hoping for something along the lines of Ill Communication and Hello Nasty, but I recieved nothing close to that. This album is 100 percent hip hop, the samples of old have almost disappeared, and there Isn't one instrumental, not one! Although I enjoy some of the songs on the album I was really hoping they would go back to having killer bass lines and amazing samples but I geuss I can settle for this."
2,Check my style out! Put cha tape decks on record!,"Strangely dated and humorless. Without the humor the Beasties come from the land of suck, without the nasty, crazy ass samples and backing tracks I just don't give a sh... Now excuse me I gotta go dig up a bee's house and eat some larva."
3,well....,"reading all the reviews going both good ways and bad, and seeing as i own this album, my opinion here is gonna have to be neither really good or utterly horrible. this is the kind of album that has amazing songs next to songs that just arent worth it. the good songs, in my opinion, are the single Ch-Check it out, Right Right Now Now, It Takes Time to Build, Triple Trouble, Oh Word, An Open Letter to NYC and We Got The. and the bad ones are well, the ones i didnt name. and yes, this album is more political than anything else the beasties have ever done, but hey! lets not hate on them for that, theyre just expressing their opinion and i happen to agree with them. overall, id say this album isnt for newcomers to them, and i think this is the album where the old fans split in two groups, the loyalists and the rebels. i guess well just have to see how things turn out."
3,get ya' mind right,"this is definitely not the best album these guys have ever put out. but overall i think it was a great effort. but you have to give them credit, because not many senior citizens possess their rhyme skills. as for those reviewers who have complained about the beastie boys' political views my question is: have you not been following their career? could you not have predicted what you were getting into? just like many great artists before them (i.e. mr. lif, public enemy, rage against the machine, etc) the beastie boys have continued to stand up for their beliefs. this shows in both their actions and their music. i'm not saying everyone should agree with them, though. i'm just saying educate yourself before you start spending money on things. it'll save you a lot of trouble. peace."
2,the boys have lost it,"sorry boys, but coming from a fan of many many years, the boys have lost it. who the hells is responsible for this one? oh that's right, the boys are! what can I say? maybe now adam (A.K.A MCA) can now go solo. yep, the beastie wrote this as propraganda for the national democratic socialist commies and are close to being as rich as them (see john scary kerry). this is evident on tracks 1,4,8,10 and 15. the best tracks are triple trouble, which should have been on pauls boutique, thats it thats all and shazam, even though it starts with one of the worst raps EVER ( gorgonzolla cheese) yep, the boys have lost it and worse still, have become what they always rapped about, sucker mc's. Im just glad I didn't pay full price for this one. it was fun while it lasted, but Diamond, yauch and Horovitz are no longer viable. oh, and were the hell was mixmaster mike? back in Cali?"
2,This album is totally forgettable,"I have listened to every other Beastie Boys album hundreds of times. I stll listen to Paul's at least once a week. This album, however, will never make it into my stereo ever again. There's just nothing special about it. It's really sad that they say they are going back to their roots when it was actually their evolution beyond the simplistic style of hip hop that is all over this album made them so special to begin with."
3,"Great beats, but the politics are a little much...","As a long time Beasties fan, I think this falls somewhere in the middle of their albums, with Paul's Boutique the greatest, and Licensed to Ill the worst (though still a solid rap album). The album definitely has grown on me, though I think the Beasties are in danger of alienating some fans with their somewhat naive and simplified political views. Hey, but that is what this country is founded upon, and what people like President Bush are fighting for, so more power to them. Overall, a very solid album, as long as you don't let the political overtones influence you."
2,"I Don't like it so, Hey F@&$ ME!","I love the Beastie Boys but this CD is ruined due to the fact that they decided to get all political. Heep your politics out of the music. Do we want feel good music, YES. Do we give a damn about your or anyone else's political views....?...NO!"
3,My first Beastie Boys album...,"I'm a big fan of Chevelle, Slipknot, and Linkin Park. I got this album after listening to Ch-Check It Out and Rhyme the Rhyme Well...which in my opinion are the best songs on the album. But overall I really feel this album is overated. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't a big Beastie Boys fan."
2,"Better beats, wacker lyrics","First off, I was a die hard for a long while of the Beasties. I quit being a die hard, cause it pxssed me off how long I had to wait between albums. Now in total honesty, I was impressed with the production. I only wish someone else was rapping over it. Their musical style is outstanding, but man I don't feel the political stuff. I consider myself an independent, but stuff like this pushes me towards Republican. I hate hippies, and I especially hate musicians/actors who know nothing more than what the liberal media feeds them. Now they think they have the right to critique our President? He makes decisions based on shxt they know zip about. Anyways, I'm sure they feel they have the responsibility to educate us and they're rich enough not to care what the ramifications are. I definitely miss the old school style lyrics. So to the Beasties, here's a big F U. Everyone download it instead!"
1,oh and one last thing...,"...who the hell are all these 'sucker mc's"" that the BBs are refering to? That's the biggest irony. They rap like they have all these enemies..they're just yelling into the void. Everyone's out to get them? Hardly, they won't be noticed for this junk. Childish.One more album like this and they'll be forgotten. If an unknown band came up with this they'd never get signed."
2,Disappointing,"Licensed to Ill, Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication...these are all 5-star albums in my estimation.Hello Nasty I give 4-stars. A bit too many of the non-hip hop songs don't quite work. But overall it's still fantastic.To the 5 Boroughs just doesn't cut it. It sounds rushed and not at all like the meticulously crafted albums I've come to expect. I want to like it. I try to like it...but there's just not that much there to enjoy. It sounds like an album of outtakes."
4,"A little new, a little old","This album was almost exactly what I expected from the Beasties. As a die-hard fan of Licensed to Ill, I found myself reminiscing back to those days and the old-school sampled beats. The difference here is that the beats are more complex and modern sounding, and the Boys now sound a bit more like men. The lyrics are more mature, but this album is really fun to party to (I've included some of the tracks on mixes i havent touched for years). This is one of the few recent hip-hop records I can honestly recommend, and I imagine (if i can find it on vinyl!!) it will be appearing on my turntable for quite awhile.Summary: Old-school gone modern, the Beasties don't think they're pirates anymore, but they still have attitude."
5,A Point For The Beasties,"Look back into the past of the Beastie Boys. Every album they released was one step ahead of the last one. Each one introduced new weirdness into their sound. TT5B shows the Beasties as what they are, mature and thoughtful, but, instead of blazing forward on the path (no funk instrumentals are to be found here, no weird turntablist tricks), they retreat back to the beginning and record a classic hip-hop album. This album absolutely glitters with Golden Age samples and sound. The overall theme is worshipping at the altar of almighty NYC; as such, this is an album that is not as universally translatable as some are. If you hate NYC with a passion or are fickle to it, this album's lyrics will not interest you in the slightest. Fortunately, you won't need the lyrics; the beats are tight and the bass is booming.This is a classic-sounding album from the maturing Beastie Boys. It is a relatively straightforward hip-hop album, but it is fun and occasionally even thought-provoking."
3,Awkward,"I'm just not sure if I like this incarnation of the Beastie Boys. Some of this wearing of their politics on their sleeve? Some of the lines are horribly awkward. I hope this is not their next direction. Their first two releases had great energy, and their 90's stage, Check Your Head to Hello Nasty, mixed a lot of styles together for a unique, fresh sound. But this? It's like they're taking old styles from their early days, but without any of the fun energy, giving sermons instead. It's awkward. That's all I'll say (if you're a diehard liberal, you may love it... independents would prefer not to be preached to, but rather, have it a bit more subtle)."
2,what happened??,"I own every beastie cd and this ones a flop. It sounds like it was made in half an hour with a casio keyboard. Every song sounds the same besides check it out. I don't know maybe its just me. I guess you gotta be from one of the five burroughs to appreciate this one. Who be rockin' y'all in sterereo??The beats are all in mono laced with hype rhymes.I gotta give it up to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego though for the rhyme thats right on time. I'm tellin' you.... is that echo?"
2,"""What's the time? It's time to retire!""","I have tried over and over to like this disc, but I can't. It's just not very good. The lyrics are sloppy and trite, and there is no consistency at ALL in this record. Some beats work well (the title track is probably one of the best songs the Beasties have ever done), but other's fall flat. I truly am a long time BB fan, and I have seen them live 4 times. But, it's time for even me to face facts, that their days of Paul's boutique and Check your head are long gone."
2,Ch-Check it out - we're politicians,"I love the Beasties but this album is not the best. Check it out is a great, but the rest seem like purely political speeches slap together in a VERY awkward way. I appreciate the fact that a band has an opinion - one song will do, but an entire album? It almost contradicts what they are trying to put across - we have a choice... but we're going to cram ours down your throat!"
5,My favorite beasties album,"I don't know why people aren't into this one, maybe they wanted more of the punk sound ala sabatoge and less of the old school/electronica sound featured on this album. I dig it, it's killer. One of the best albums I've bought recently along with Mr.Deviant's ""Techno Obsession""."
3,"Good, not great","Reminds me of licensed to ill, a good CD with nice beats and lyrics, just man they decided to add their two cents about politics. Like many other artists, they think that putting a few albums out gives them some special insight into the human psyche that no one else has. Wish people would shut up and lets us in the military do our job and get it done. The music is good, it would have gotten 4 stars except for their stupidity. If you liked licensed to ill I suggest this, though its nothing like Paul's Botique."
2,"Too Bad,","This album has unfortunately turned out to be a huge disappointment. The beats are pretty good in most places, and some songs have some good flow, but f__k their politcal bullsh*t! Their mainstream approach to politcs is LAME, LACKS INTELLIGENCE, and makes their music sound increadibly DATED!!!!!!!! Pacifism does not counter insanity! I'm no right winger or even close, but come, on these lame political lyrics should annoy any beastie boys fan who has half a brain."
2,"Old, Tired, and Gray","That about sums it up folks. With regard to the complaints about the political nature of some of the lyrics, I say this- This is a product of just getting older and feeling the need to make music that ""matters"" or is important in a social context- but these are the Beastie Boys- they have just run out of steam- waiting 6 years to make a record will do that to you. I never like artists that get to much into politics- I don't care if they don't like the president, but these lyrics are straight off the talking points of the Democratic Party- This is supposed to be fun party time stuff, but now they have a social conscience- good for them- I just don't want to hear about that stuff in music-"
4,Music solid...could very much do w/o the political Bull sh%t,"For the most part, this album is very solid. The beats and the rhymes sound more old school which for rap I love. However, why in the world do we need a bunch of childish late 30(almost 40 yr. old) something rappers forcing their liberal political agenda down our throats? I get so sick of these left wing and out of touch entertainers not trying to unite the United States. Didn't 9/11 teach us anything people? We can't just cower to the terrorists. The Beasties should stick to making entertaining albums and shelve their political agenda. No wonder this country is so divided. We can't even get along and realize who the real enemy is."
2,Irrelevant,"And just like that it was irrelevant. To quote from track four -""We got a president we didn't elect.""I have given this record a few months to sink in. I bought it on May 8, 2004. I kept thinking that it would get better and more enjoyable. Instead it just got worse and worse. Remember how the Beastie Boys used to dress up as preachy old people in their videos? It isn't so much of a stretch any more. The Beastie Boys have turned into a bunch of bitter old men who sit around whining about politics and they have a record to prove it. I would have given it one star but I gave it two because I did get some use out of it. Last night I used it as a coaster for the champagne I was drinking to celebrate an election that was the complete repudiation of the beliefs on this record. Cheers!"

2,too political,"I really regret buying this cd. I didn't know it was going to be so politically-motivated. I really like a few of the songs (hence the two stars), but too many of them seem like an attempt to brainwash, or at least influence, listeners with a Liberal point-of-view.They should have stuck to songs about girls and parties."
4,Get over it...,"Okay, the CD is good. I've always been more of a fan of the hip-hop Beasties than the punk Beasties. It's a pleasure to hear the silly rhymes again...especially the 'dissing (and slamming beat) on ""Well F___ You"". The bad is mainly that this CD musically lacks the creativity of most of their former CD's. Do we really need to hear ANOTHER song that samples ""Rapper's Delight""? They could've dug a lot deeper on some of these songs, especially with six years to work with.For everyone that doesn't like the fact that they mention politics...get over it. Music has always been a venue for freedom of speech and God willing it always will be. It's one of the things that makes our country great and the Beastie Boys know that. If you were somehow unaware they were political then you've had your head in the sand (or somewhere else) for quite a while now. If I have to start seeing ""Caution, political ideas expressed that may not agree with yours"" warning stickers I'm going to be really upset..."
4,This is what hip hop is about...,"Good lyrics and great beats run through this album, and the Beastie Boys use sampling and scratching to perfection as usual. This is what hip hop is about. No blinging or ""let me talk about how rich I am"", just hip hop. I've faded away from hip hop after it's all become about marketing but this is a great month for it with the release of ""5 Boroughs"" and the Roots new CD. No, its not ""License to Ill"" or ""Pauls B"", but it's definetly worth picking up. Every hip hop fan should just because their the Beastie Boys. Legends."
5,Great CD and I am not a rap fan of note,"I am nbot a big rap fan - I may own maybe 2 CD's out of thousands that would be considered rap/hip-hop. That being said, I love this CD. I bought basically off the Rolling Stone review and I am glad I did. I remember the Beastie Boys from the 80's but didn't even own that CD. I have since bought Licensed To Ill and Paul's Boutique. The music on Boroughs is outstanding and the sentiments heartfelt. This CD is NOT overrated and these guys are more than ""fight for your right...."""
3,WHa?,"So, what happened?A mix of Hello Nasty and Blah. THis album is full of songs that sound like re-hashes of older ones. There are a few songs that grab your attention, but it's only because they were sampled.Th rhymes are ok, but the musical journey you go on is about as long as my driveway. I put the cd in and for the first time I wanted to fast forward to the next song to see if it was better. The next thing I realize is....I'm at the end of the cd...Pretty much a let down cd...hopefully they will rebound like they always do with a break through performance or EP."
4,still good,"First of all i want to address all of the people dissing this album becuase of its emphasis on politics. Only about 3 or 4 songs are soley based on politics. And these songs are still great and have awesome beats. So even if you don't want to hear the beasties rapping about politics there are still about 11 tracks you can enjoy. But, all in all this cd is very solid. A lot of people dissed for being too generic and not as experimental as other albums. They wanted to make a NYC album, and thats what they did. The beats were produced by the beasties themselves and they did a great job. The lyrics are up to par as well. If this type of straight up hiphop is not your cup of tea don't buy the album."
3,Not up to par,"I've listened to this album - that's right the LP - 10 times and it does not add up to a bona-fide Beastie classic, in fact with the 4 stars I gave Hello Nasty, I hope I'm not seeing a downward trend here. The rhymes are sophomoric and politically charged but they are not as well crafted as those found on the trio's 3 masterieces (Paul's, Check your head, and Ill communication). Although I do agree whole-heartedly with their politics, the construction of the songs lyrically just doesn't do it for me. The production also varies and is mostly minimal. All you have to do is listen to the track called ""f*** you"" to hear the decline in action. I do still recommend the album because hey, it's the Beasties and still better than most."
5,Kickin',"Fresh lyrics, not too familiar with their other material, but this is what music is about. Got a lot of old Run-DMC feels to it. Open Letter to NYC absolute brilliance. Once again, fresh and worth owning.-d"
3,Flimsy fun,"A more party-oriented, minimally melodic work from some of the better produced emcees around does become repetitious with a limited, scarcely electro palate and endless New York braggadocio but the underlying current of cool never fully recedes."
5,Loved it Before I Bought it,I had checked out To the 5 Boroughs from the library and fell in love with it before I purchased it.Track after track makes me want to dance and rap right along. I enjoy their beats and sense of humor.
5,A fave - again!,"Think of any other bands that have lasted this long - and still put out great (no, I mean GREAT) albums. The list would be pretty short - but the Beasties would be on it. This album is fantastical: great beats and better lyrics ... A band that has given us some of the best lyrical lines has just put out a whole new album of stuff that goes on my ""Fave List""."
4,"Great album, but much too political","I would have given this album 5 stars if the lyrics were a bit more varied and apolitical from song to song. The political lyrics make the songs all sound a bit cheesey.On the plus side the vocals are excellent, the rhythms are intricate, and the rhymes are right up to par for what you'd expect from these guys."
2,Beastie Boys Are All Washed Up,I cant believe I waited 6 years for this garbage. It doesnt contain the cutting edge nature of their earlier albums. Rhythms are flat and lame. This is by far their worst album. Heed the reviews folks. If you really like the Beastie Boys wait till the album hits the .99 cent rack. Dont waste your hard earned dollars.
3,Cheap collection of sports anthems,"For the price you can get it here on Amazon, this is a decent little collection of pop sports songs and random obscurities. Hey, they had me at Happy Organ and Shout. Here's a track listing, with times as observed:Check It - The BoonDockMen (4:16)Jumpin' the Gun - Meatloaf (3:10)Happy Organ - Dave ""Baby"" Cortez (2:01)I Want Candy - Bow Wow Wow (3:32)Tequila - Duane Eddy (2:00)Good Morning Judge - Buster Poindexter (3:38)Shout (Parts 1 & 2) - Isley Brothers (4:22)I'm So Excited - The Pointer Sisters (5:36)Hot Hot Hot - Buster Poindexter (4:04)We Built This City - Starship (4:50)No Time - The Guess Who (3:19)Intro / Sweet Jane - Lou Reed (8:01)"
1,Poor Design for Utility Knife,"I got the Stanley 10-799 as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift from my wife. Its a great looking, well balanced knife. But the functionality is poor. To begin with the blade does not retract as the picture would lead you to believe, it's fixed. There is no way in the world to change blades easily, especially while wearing work gloves. You can't simply hang this knife on your shop peg board hook, it has no hole in the handle. A very poor design. btw, I told my wife it's perfect....shhh"
1,A strange dichotomy,"Denise Glenn is all in favor of women embracing the grace and freedom that Jesus offers. But, for some reason, she does not believe it should extend to young women--girls. Or boys, for that matter.Grace is for ALL. It is for children, too. But Denise Glenn promotes a very legalistic environment for children. No wonder so many adults have difficulty accepting God's grace--they've been trained that there's a punishment around every corner.If you've read this book or chose to read it, I highly encourage you to also read a copy of Families Where Grace is in Place by VanVonderen. At least look at another viewpoint. God said the Kindgom of Heaven belongs to such as these (children). I don't believe He is pleased when we accept His grace for ourselves but then turn around and deny grace to our children."
5,Gist of Genetics,"I've had Dr. Davis as a professor and he used this book as a reading for the course. It is very helpful and straight to the point, will help you see the big picture, as well as providing the important details."
5,The Heads rock on...,"Hooks, hooks, and more hooks. The tightest album the Headhunters have released since their debut ""Pickin' on Nashville"". Everyone is in top form. And, the songwriting is begining once again to equal the musicianship these boys posess. Buy it and turn it up loud."
5,Kickin' Country!!,"If like me you believe that country music on the whole could use a serious kick up the butt, then you've just found the band that can do it. This bunch of southern boys are wearing some extra large kickin boots and well and truly in a league with Webb Wilder for style points.They blend Rock and Country seemlessly with a healthy dose of southern witt. ""Neck of the Woods"", Kentucky Wildcat"" and ""Southern Belle"" are the highlights on this album.Warning: Best listened to as loud as ya wife will let ya!! (sic)"
4,A mixed bag...,"...mostly interesting, occasionally excellent or pedestrian. I found the editor's own essay tedious. Overall good fun."
4,Nice,"A nice gift for the salmon lover, comes in a nice small wooden boat than can be hung on your wall when you are finished with the food products."
4,Great book for all budding physicists,"This book is rather elementary for the graduate level, but does a great job at explaining concepts clearly, concisely, and eloquently, using laymen terms where appropriate. I also deeply appreciate the occasional comedy implemented by the author. I would personally recommend ""The Essential Collection of Elegant Solutions for Doctoral Physics Qualifying Exams,"" by Shijun Liu (2000)."
5,Great natural looking tan!,"I heard about this product from a friend. I told her how tan her legs looked and she told me it was from using this stuff. I had to go out and get some to try for myself. I really like it! I plan to only apply this when I wear dresses or shorts so I am not looking for something that lasts forever. I have naturally pale skin and I don't like tanning. This product went on great and gave me a nice, even tan that as subtle but really pretty. What I did was applied it and then waited a few hours and applied some again. This gave me a darker tan but not so much that people would start to get suspicious of my sudden tan. It has a coconut smell which I didn't mind. I'm really pleased with this product especially for what I need it for."
1,Nice color for a day,This gives a nice tan/bronze color for the day that you wear it. The next day when you wash-it's gone. I wouldn't spend my money on this.
2,Great for Snookie..,"If you like the Snookie fake 'n bake look, than this product is great for you! I felt that this product didn't last as long as other on your skin, smelled of that funky ""tan in a tube"" smell, and made this white girl look like she rolled in mud. If you are already tan, and want that extra super-duper fake look, than this will work great."
4,Works,"Not too streaky. Goes on Easily with a nice coconut smell, not the yuck self-tanner smell. Actually changes the color of my legs on application, but not in a too-obvious way. I like it. Just have to make sure to take time when applying to get it even."
5,Ubiquitous,"Anybody who does any kind of framing, at any time, has one of these. Not the best hammer by any means - but it's a darned good hammer all the same. I have a pile of bigger framers, but this hammer just rocks in general. And it drives a spike in two shots.This is my all time number two hammer for nailing. Only downside is that because of the waffle head, I refuse to use it for punches and the like.I might sound harsh, but I love this hammer. I keep coming back to it, no matter how more expensive my newest acquisition is, this one does the job beautifully."
2,Not so reliable,"I had a entirely new garage door and chamberlain door opener with an additional Chamberlain 940D Wireless, Keyless Entry System, 315 MHz opener outside on the wall.The opener worked for a short time and then intermittently worked and did not work. after awhile the buttons stopped working with the 4 digit code. (contact issue)also sometimes when you change the battery the code erases and you have to reenter it. not very good quality."
4,Works perfectly,"I had my automatice garage door refurbished and needed a new digital key pad for outside access.. The installer said he could furnish one for about $50 and said I could probably do better buying one retail. At two major home repair stores I found them for about $40. This one cost about, if I remember, about $12 and works perfectly. Simple to install and program."
5,Works Great,"I have a 2010 Chamberlain (purple button & wire) garage door opener. Ordered a 940D, received a 940CD Keyless Entry for it. Appears to basically be the same thing. Programming was very easy, worked perfectly first time when programmed. Instructions are accurate, took about 30 seconds to program, 10 minutes to mount on door frame."
3,Doesn't work in cold weather,"The clicker doesn't work at all in weather below 25F which I needed it to. Lights don't turn on, no signal, etc. Otherwise the product works great when it's warm.Use the Klik2U product instead for cold weather. I've used it at -15F and it's perfect."
1,Sustituded Product Without Notification,Beware. I ordered the 940D. Without notifing me they sent me a 377LM. The 377LM is available 15% less from other Amazon vendors. I paid a premium because I wanted the 940D. I have contacted them to resolve.
2,functional but flimsy,"It does what it says. But the cheap plastic shell is in no way adequate for outdoor mounting, especially here in Minnesota. The mounting consists a single slotted hole on the back of the plastic case, which means it bobbles around as you try to use it and is easily knocked off. Instead of a rugged weatherproof keyboard, there's an irritating plastic cover to flip up every time.The cheap construction makes it overpriced. And yes, I'm sick of these plastic clam shell packages too. In fact I'd say the packaging appears to be sturdier than the product."
5,Awesome & Easy!!,The Chamberlain 940D Wireless Keyless Entry System is simple to install and easy to use. I put it up in less than five minutes and had it running right away. The instructions are right on the flip up panel so you can set temporary passwords when needed that can be set for the number of hours you want it to work or with the number of attempts to open the door. I will never lock myself out of my house again! ;)
4,Good beginning book,This is a useful book and provides a good basis for learning how to design and assemble a dollhouse built from scratch.
1,Loud Buzzing sound after 1 week,"I bought this item and used it for one week. Now when I cut it on, it makes a LOUD buzzing sound and I'm afraid it might explode! Bad design, bad product, don't buy."
4,Easy energy,"After being away from running for 30 years, I have run 4 5K races in the past 4 months. Gu is easy to carry, easy to open and does help me maintain energy to finish my races. I really like the Espresso Love flavor."
5,Great for running,I use these occasionally when I go on runs. They're very rich tasting (think thin frosting) but pack a big energy punch for being so small. I prefer the chocolate over the other flavors.
1,Yuck!!!,This gel in nothing but a tube of sugar! Bottom line... It DOES NOT increase my energy level.
1,Horrible!,I would rate this product with zero stars if I could. It tastes like a tube of absolute sugar.
5,Love it!,This is one of the best yoga books I have ever read. The knowledge and insight I take from Lilias' experience and expertise is invaluable to me as an ongoing student and teacher of yoga.
5,Inspirational book for children,I owned this book and during the 17 years that I led Sunday School classes I read from it to the children- recently I met a lady who is now 40 and she said she still remembers how we read from this book! I lost my copy and amnow so happu tp have one again.
3,For my family tree,"My great-grandfather was in the Civil War Southern Confederate Army based in New Orleans. No one knows how or why he wa,s there from Canada, so I'm always looking to find information about him. This little book is very interesting even though I didn't find anything to help my search."
3,A Good Book for Dad,"My husband bought this book when we found out we were expecting twins and so I decided to read it too. It really is more of an overview on the subject with very little detailed information for mom. I read it in an afternoon and didn't find it helpful in detailed nutritional information, indepth discussions on birthing options or logistics for after babies arrive but its posative and upbeat tone is perfect for alaying dad's fears and giving him a good brief of what's in store without all the additional information that mom would find useful but he may find pointless. Written in more of a ""for dummies"" format it is a quick read but if you rely on details you will probably want to research a different book."
4,great for first time mom expecting multiples,This book really helped me get through a triplet pregnancy. It gave me some ideas for the future as well. It was well worth the read.
4,Triplets,Very informational and is helping to understand the events that have happened and will happened.
4,Great!,"The Saddle Club is bored with riding and even their horses. Lisa and Stevie are training for a competition with Alex and Carole thinks it's time to sell Starlight. I thought this was a great book, I hope everyone else likes it."
4,Answers to the Dressage person,"Well, first of all, the piaffes. Horses that have benn trained to do a piaffe can, and it IS realistic. And IT'S A FICTION BOOK! Carole should not of gotten a dressage horse, because she's into jumping. Stevie is the one into Dressage and she has a dressage horse. Also, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THAT BOOK! Well, I think if you're like me, you'll like the book, but t won't be the best book you've ever read. Tired of horses? But everything else was good. I especially like how Bonnie matched up the tasks with the characters."
2,There are better books out there...,"I do not recommend this book.It's one of the older ones out there, you can tell by the looks of the photos, most are riding rigid fork mountain bikes.Being an older book, some of the trails listed are no longer opened to mountain biking. One for example is one of the Palos Verde rides. I drove 20 mins to make this ride only to find out that bikes have been prohibited here for several years.The map and trail diagrams are too small and crowded.Don and Sharon have a road bike that is much better than this mountain bike trail book.The book's writing style does have charm, but the maps are what's important and these maps could be better.The only redeeming value to this book is the altitude graph. This did save me on some rides.Don and Sharon... if you are reading this, please update your book with current trails and maybe some new photos. Your Los Angeles road bike trails book was good, but not this one."
2,Kind of rinky-dink...,"This is kind of a dorky, rinky-dink book. There's better ones out there. Seems out of date, and out of touch with things."
4,Great artworks but lousy workmanship,"I love the artworks in the book but the workmanship is lousy. I ordered 2 of them and they both have creases on the cover and glue on the pages. In some pages you can feel the bumps from the excessive glue inside the pages. I have alot of pop books and this one has the worst workmanship. But I love the contents and my kids love it too. They need to send the work to some experience paper engineers.Review updated on 12/01/06: I ordered my 2 books from Amazon. Last week I went to the gift shop in the Metropolitan Museum of NY. They have 6 copies of ""One Red Dot"" in the store. And they all have creases on the cover. :-("
4,One Red Dot Pop-ip,This book is OK but not nearly as intricate as some of the ones I've bought for my wife. But overall it's not bad.
5,Kids LOVE this!,"I bring this book out occasionally (delicate, definitely needs supervision) and my kids go nuts over it. Very well crafted and a joy to read/play with"
2,i don't know if this is the real thing,"I received this product. It looks the same as what I had purchased in a parfumerie about a year ago. Same bottle, same printing, same box. However, I am suspicious that it is not the same. The scent is slightly different, less intense. I would assume that Hermes has quality control, especially as something as sensitive as a cologne. Other than passing it through a gas-liquid chromatograph (which I don't happen to have) I am unable to effectively determine authenticity."
1,"not as advertised, doesn't fit older chrysler products, info not specific, can't use","read above, can't use as intended, no bit storage in handle, bought unit at Advance Auto, works fine $2.00 difference."
5,"Finally, an update source of information!","Im a teenager and was diagnosed with CF when I was born in 1989.It was recently that I wanted to do some more reading on my disease. I looked through some books and was shocked by what I was reading. As many of you know, the out-of-date books on CF can have some very frightening information, like death and more infections, and etc. It was I discovered this book that I was so much more relaxed about my condition. This book is up-to-date and tells the real facts about this disease. After reading this, my disease doesn't scare me anymore.If you are a teen, like me, I suggest you read thid.If you know anybody with CF, you should read this book or have them read this. Don't let them read those early books on CF with the grim facts...have them read this with the true and helpful facts."
2,Good while it lasted,This oven worked great for about 2 years. The toast was consistent and I even baked a couple of frozen pies in it that turned out great. Pizza reheated well and Pillsbury biscuits came out well. Only problem is it just didn't last! The toaster part works but the oven and broiler died.
3,Consumer Reports Ranks This As A Mid-Quality Toaster-Oven,"Consumer Report's ranks the Black and Decker CTO8000 and CTO9000 7th out of 13 toaster-ovens. They say that it is 'very good' at baking and broiling but only good (in my opinion so-so) at toasting. Out of the 6 toaster-oven's that ranked above it, 4 were less expensive: Delonghi, Panasonic, Toastmaster (2).Conclusion: You can get a better toaster-oven for less."
2,Must be a lemon,"When I bought this oven...it was so my teenage son could cook without using the large oven. I loved it when I first bought it..but soon grew to call it a POS....The knobs started falling off...the aluminum pans were a mess, they are hard to clean. I have to keep them covered in foil because I wouldn't put food directly on them the way they look. The toaster part of the oven doesn't work. It only toasts on one side.It won't turn off, I have to unplug it to get it to turn off. I am very disappointed with this oven. Glad the rest of you had a good experience with yours, because I didn't."
1,DOES NOT LAST,I purchased this to replace an old B&D model that lasted for years. The first one of these I bought had to be returned after 3 months because the toaster button would not work. The replacement only lasted 4 months. I'm going to have to spend the money and buy a quality one.
4,A real work horse,"This toaster oven gets a real workout from me. It perform's just as advertized, but has one annoying drawback. It could be engineered so as to afford an easier way of cleaning the interior. I toast, bake and broil in it, and wish some of the interior part's could be removed to a dishwasher."
3,Great When It Works!,"CTO8000 arrived October 29, 2004 but October 12, 2005, toaster button refused to stay on! No Toast! B&D; honored warranty, but was not aware that they would send what they wanted me to have.Very unhappy with item sent. Original choice was white (for a reason); this is silver; the size is off, unacceptable. Called B&D;/Applica w/my complaint. Said sorry but CTO8000 no longer available, hope can find satisfaction w/CTO650. Other choice is to shop around, make another purchase of white & size!"
4,Does the job!,For the price it is great the antivibe handle seems to do the job and the hammer feels well constructed and strudy with alot of the weight in the head and very light in the handle and neck which is nice it really drives the nailes well. Workmenship and polishing could be better look a bit ruff around the edges like it just came out of the mold but it works fine.
4,"It's not a stiletto, but...it was $20, so theres a tradeoff","I like my hammer. It is a good hammer. Good weight distribution, good leverage, cool look (minus the safety warning sticker - I blame Ralph Nader, Helen Thomas and other self-righteous liberals). It only took me 30 years to figure this out, but you get what you pay for, cliche' I know, but true - no more of those 3/$1 hammers at Timmy and Tina's discout tools."
3,Hammered,"Nothing fancy here. Just a hammer. I wanted a 20-ounce claw hammer, and that is what I got. I have others that I like better, but there is really nothing wrong with this one. Don't really know what I was expecting, but it is just a hammer."
1,Crooked Hammer,I don't know if this is part of the design but the hammer is bent to the left. Looks great when not being used though.
1,Impenetrable,"Rowe's obtuse, convoluted writing style buries his ideas in a morass of verbal sludge, rendering them totally inaccessible to the layman and barely comprehensible to the typical architecture student. After encountering this book several times in the course of various classes, I was surprised to realize how comparatively simple the ideas it contains are. In the typical fashion of upper-level humanities academia, however, Rowe hides his point behind impossibly twisted sentences and an onslaught of outside references that seems designed more to impress the reader with Rowe's own wide-ranging knowledge than to enlighten. The ideas of this book could be condensed to a short essay, and the only thing lost would be the page count."
4,ANOTHER SEASON-HEY HEY HEY!,I own the first season and watch episodes of it on weekend mornings. Glad to see they are bringing the 2nd season on DVD!! I hope to get it soon. They just don't make any funny shows like this anymore. It is a shame there are only 3 surviving cast members of the show now. Too bad the 1st season doesn't have any extras on it like outtakes and whatnot (that is the only bummer I have on the 1st season set).
5,The Second Season,"They are all good. but my favorite show was when they had the talent show at school and Dwayne performed and sang the song ""Hanyman"". Oh God!!!!! LOL!!!! I literally start crying everytime I watch that episode!!!!!This has got to be the funniest sitcom ever made. I can't wait for the third season to come out."
5,always a cool Show,"dug all the cats on the show plus Dee,Shirley,&Mrs. Thomas who always had that Belt ready for Rog. this was a Fun Show that had everything work together.I've been waiting for this show to get released&this is really cool.can't wait for the next season to arrive as well."
2,Band too long!,"I would only purchase this watch if you have a large wrist. When I put the watch on, the band wrapped around so far that the end of it overlapped the watch face! The strap is definitely a longer length than normal. I could have saved myself the hassle of returning it if the description of the watch would have included the length of the band."
3,Not worth the price,"Maybe the dollar buys less or this is just overpiced, either way I don't think this is worth the price. Maybe 10 dollars or less."
5,WOW,"I have always been a huge fan of the Marleys ive seen a couple of his sons in concert and the entire family never stops amazing me, what a book i love it!!!!1"
3,I have all moby's music but this one doesn't cut it for me,This was only a mediocre album for me. I doubt I'll listen to it much in the future. Oh well.
1,Only Jean-Luc Picard can pull off shave-man look okay!,"I am thinking to self > drinking all day, almost run over old lady on street. Maybe I find something mellow to calm the nervesI see Telly Savalas on CD. WOW! Kojak busts a hard co' beat. I buy it and take home. Stop drinking for an hour to listen.Oh my Adolf! I can not even think to myself ""what the hell is this?"" I look again at CD. NOT Kojak, oh no! Some guy named for whale is making electro-waves in my head!I get up to destroy CD player but can't make it across room. Suddenly my legs starts moving and I am dancing to crazy guy with Captain Picard look playing xylophone with stale twinkies!Finally wheat beer Hefeweisen wears off and time to sleep. Moby is now quiet, because my shoe went through speaker and ruined 4000 $ stereo.Buy this CD if and only if --- you can find no other way to torture your neighbors who are too old to handle phunk-transe-ssycho-electro in their walls."
1,Crap,Moby knows his music is junk. He just wanted to create another crappy album as an excuse to put the back of his flaky baldhead on the front of an album cover.
1,Outrageously B_A_D,"i've been a Moby fan since 1999 when ""play"" came out and got used to this style of his and even enjoyed ""18"" when that was released.beware: this cd is nothing like either of these. it's incredibly bad music. the lyrics are more simple than usual and there is a hinge of happiness in most of the songs, but this cd is terrible. moby sings on most all the tracks and then some other lady has a few tracks of her own in a very slow story like way.if you are lucky enough to get the 2-disc version, disc2 is the only saving grace of this waste of money (if you have the soundscapes or atmospheres sound channel on satellite, that is basically what you get with disc2).i honestly don't see how anyone could enjoy this HOTEL cd...massive letdown.-cwc."
2,Moby Goes SOLO?,"Being Moby's fan I purchased this album on its first release date. Very dissapointed with his new HOTEL album.Weak songs,boring bits,bad singing.CD 2 (Ambient) is a magazine cafe reading music.I wish I could bring this cd back and get my money back from the store.Save your cash on this one."
3,Hotel won't Play...,"Just got CD, listened to it & read other reviews. Yes, Play is his best album. Yes, Hotel is not very commercial....it is so uncommercial that it's bland. Yes, do buy this for disc 2 - ambient. This is where his talent lies and always has. I hate to think he had a fluke w/ Play. I didn't care for 18 as much, and this CD is worse than that. Unfortunately, what most breaks it for me are his vocals. He sounds as uninterested in what he's singing as I am in hearing it. The monotone vocal is his style, fine..... I say, stick w/ samples; take a listen to DJ Food or DJ Shadow if you liked Play. Unless you're a diehard Moby fan, I'd say skip it. And, as always, look for the remixed singles which will always outperform the album version. And at $12 a pop for those singles, you will have gotten better music than the 14 songs on this 1st disc."
1,in italy is for cellphone commercials ......................,uffa uffa el nuestro heroe al strike back againah. nu me place nu me place. En italia funzionaza for cellphone commercial si eu cred ca se accordaza prima multo prima de comenciar ca tanto èste sigur che produze melodia comerciala. This is why Moby SUCKS AND SUCKS AGAINAH. Eu nu reserva el dinero sesterzio pe cumparar acest disco. Nu. Customers escuzaze me pe aver written el commentar cu esperanto desparsido but i think it is facil de comprender. Asta la puerca vaca semper.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
2,Full of himself,"This is Moby at his worst. By the time I got to the egocentric ""Beautiful"" I felt like returning the cd for a refund. The 2nd disc is O.K., but the first is a great disappointment. Last Moby I'll buy new."
2,5 Stars for the bonus ambient disc,"I think fans have to be honest about Hotel: It is a disappointing effort. The album begins with great promise. The intro is an excellent, subtle, synth piece. It suits the sterile, soft colours used in the cd art. From there the album drops off. Moby isn't much of a guitar player-so a near whole album of ""post-punk""-ish pop tunes is hard to enjoy. ""I like it"" is particularly bad. There are some bright spots. ""Raining Again"" and ""Lift Me up"" are passable. The cover of New Order's ""Temptation"" with singer Dawn is actually fairly good. The album ends well with some nice ambient compositions. ""Homeward Angel"" is excellent.If you can find a copy with the bonus ambient cd, buy it. The second disc is unapologetically electronic, slow, long, and beautiful. It is one for the fans and more than makes up for the short-comings of the first disc."
2,Moby runs out of ideas,"First off, the biggest problem with this CD is Moby himself. Lyrically insipid and dominated by Moby's listless monochromatic voice, it feels as if it was composed by Moby Composition Software 1.0. Start out with a guitar hook of some sort. Then bring in dry robotic vocal for verse. When catchy hook chorus kicks in, double the vocals and add some synth string washes for dramatic effect. Its all so predictable and manipulative its laughable. Nothing feels spontaneous. The more you listen to ""Hotel"", the more the facade peels away revealing an artist adrift and creatively bankrupt. Even a shoe gazing, stripped down, female-voiced version of New Order's ""Temptation"" is unoriginal. Flunk has perfected this New Order remake stunt already on both their albums."
5,Beautiful & Breathtaking,"I recently picked ""Hotel"" up, and I have really enjoyed it so far. My favorite songs on the CD are Hotel Intro, Spiders, Very, I Like It, & Homeward Angel. I don't know if this is necessarily Moby's best work to date, but I think it is right up there among his best. I really enjoyed Moby's 18 B-Sides as well.However, the Ambient CD that is included with this purchase is in my opinion what really shines through here. As an amateur film editor currently in college, (hoping to make it big), Moby's ambient music is both inspiring and mystifying and it truly motivates me in my work. I can't even put into words the emotions that I feel when I listen to these tracks, especially ""Blue Paper"" and ""Chord Sounds"", and if you do not know what I am talking about then I pity you. Moby is truly an amazing artist and I just can't get enough of his brilliant work.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album. You WILL NOT be disappointed. Keep up the fantastic work Moby!"
3,Worth A Listen,"A very enjoyable CD. ""Very"" brings this album up. Way up. Reminiscent of 80's dance club stalwarts ""Earthquake,"" ""Rain,"" ""Danger for Love,"" or Sandy Marton's ""Exotic and Erotic,"" Laura Dawn is excellent on this track with its catchy, flirtatious, euro-pop dance club energy that's hard to resist. Other goodies are ""Beautiful,"" ""Raining Again,"" ""Lift Me Up."" If you don't like Moby, that's fine, but then don't buy ""Hotel,"" and certainly don't review it. Just because you don't happen to like it doesn't mean that it's garbage."
5,Moby Gets Better with Age,"If you follow Moby's work since the early nineties, you'll probably agree that this is one of his finest works. The album concept (make sure you read the inside album jacket) is surreal to me, and makes this album so real. A must have for us Moby collectors and followers. Just as a heads up, it's much more ambient than some of his popular stuff, so if you are still stuck in Porcelain and South Side (or in other words, mostly his mainstream stuff) this album may not be for you."
2,A disappointment,I am a big fan and have all his cd's. But this one won't get played a lot. Double music doesn't mean more enjoyment when the songs are so monotonous they might just be one long song.
3,Definetly not Moby's greatest work,"I've been following Moby's work ever since he did his album 'Play.' The song that got me interested in Moby was 'Natural Blues'--one of the best songs ever by Moby! Once I bought 'Play' then I was convinced that Moby was truly one of a kind in his beautiful melodies and simplistic lyrics. Then I bought his album '18' and really enjoyed it, but when I recently heard samples of his album 'Hotel' I thought it was way off the sound that I was used to hearing from Moby. I'm sorry but this album was terrible...although I did enjoy a couple of his tracks--'Forever' and 'Love Should.' These tracks were beautiful...but I just did not feel that this was Moby's greatest work."
1,Disappointing,"I bought Hotel on faith, Moby has been awesome and up until now his albums have always impressed me (even if 18 sounded a lot like play). But Hotel was a huge disappointment. It's boring and average, the vocals are... Well, I hate to say it, but poor. The lyrics mean nothing; they're trite and repetitive. I prefer when he was just making music, just interesting stuff to listen to, and now every song has lyrics but none of the songs are saying anything. The whole album blends together for me, most of the songs sound very similar. Sure, a few songs have stood out and made me pay attention, but they're definitely not what I would have expected from an artist like Moby.Disc two is interesting, but it's background music and not nearly good enough to save this album. I know Moby is capable of more! But next time I'll listen to the album before I buy it."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!! Buy from Amazon - get half the music!,"This CD is available in TWO CD set -- Amazon only offers the one CD version in spite of the fact that the two cd version is the SAME price at other retailers. When I complained to Amazon I was told essentially ""buyer beware"" -- not the service I usually expect from Amazon. It's a slightly below average Moby album but I can't really review it -- because I only got half the music.My first unsatisfactory Amazon purchase."
2,Much better producer than vocalist,"I'm a huge fan of Moby (""Play"" remains one of my favorite cds ever), but ""Hotel"" was badly disappointing. I knew this cd didn't contain the same level of high tempo music I've heard previously with Moby, but aside from a few tracks, the music never caught my attention. I don't mind his vocals, if they were placed properly, but Moby tries too much to be a lead singer on this disc, and it just didn't work for me. If you must buy it, I'd get it used."
2,This is why you shouldn't pay for music,"What was I thinking...I actually paid for a CD without listening to it first, only because it was Moby and I love everything he has ever released. Big mistake. This CD is neither evolved or refined, just a quick and dirty release. Listen to this one before you buy it and decide for yourself."
5,Moby is awesome,"I absolutely love the Hotel Cd.In fact I am going to order it for my daughter for Christmas.The song I Like It, is just so sensual. I think moby has a very seductive voice. This is my first Cd of his. if anyone knows of one of his others that is very seductive please advice me.Its awesome!"
1,*yawn*,"Oh wow, I was really expecting more than what I got. I heard ""Beautiful"" on the radio and was very impressed with the sound and feel of the song. I popped the cd in and was hit with a feeling like I should be on a yoga mat finding my inner self. That's what I expected but I already had a cd like that.I was bored with this cd and I would suggest that you don't waste your money."
2,Not Surprised It Didn't Impress,"Ambient CD aside, the album sounds generic. A few songs sound almost identical. The lyrics are full of cliches. The beats are all too familiar and boring. I agree with the other people on here who don't think Moby can carry an entire album vocally. What made Moby so wonderful was his ability to combine beautiful melodies, beats and vocals. This sounds like U2 to me in some places. We'll never get another 'Play,' but I'll keep hoping. I'll shelve it up there with Medulla, The BeeKeeper and Dear Catastrophe Waitress. What's happening to all my favorite artists?BTW...Check out Halou - 'Wiser.'"
1,BORING!!!!!,Moby has released a very bland Album that is lifeless&just background filler. in the past he was able to have soemthing catchy&Hide His limited vocal skills but this Set has Him flat vocally&Musically.
1,Moby makes a huge departure from his usual style,"I am a loyal Moby fan, as I own just about every one of his CD's and listen to them often, without tiring of them....but what a disappointment Hotel is. Moby makes the huge mistake of singing on nearly every song...and he can't sing for his life...horrible voice, not even able to reach certain ranges. Hang it up Moby and stick with the keyboards...and keep borrowing other's voices...this is what has worked for you so well on Play and 18. The only saving grace is the Hotel Ambient, alas, because Moby's voice is nowhere to be found.Not even Teany tea and honey can help that voice. Save your money."
2,a disappointment,This album is a total disappointment. I am a Moby fan and this album is crap compared to the other ones. Do not spend money on this junk. This is some really populist and commercialized songs which are not original at all.
2,"Find the 2CD Set with the Ambient Tracks, that's good. However the Pop Songs on the Main Album are Horrible","There was a limited edition of Hotel released. A 2CD set that had a bunch of bad pop-rock music on CD1 and some soothing, evocative ambient music on CD2. If you can find that 2CD set, good, buy it. Otherwise beware of pathetic, pandering pop music that's more awful than U2 or Coldplay at their worst. The lyrics are uninspired and pleading, the melodies are trite. I felt like I wanted to throw the damn thing away as soon as I heard it!Hotel Ambient is another matter, it's very much Moby doing what he does best. Those Ambient tracks are not the best he's ever done in the genre but they add to his catalogue, not make you hate him like the asinine pop-rock drivel he produces."
4,Worth the purchase,"I really dig Moby's latest effort - it's a great album to drive and walk to - great grooves. Def. some party tunes on here - ""Lift Me Up"" and ""beautiful."" some really nice ballads too. My fave is"" Spiders"" - they should use this song in Spiderman 17 or whatever # they are up to... i love the artowork too - it's a great deal - two full cd's and great packaging and great music!"
3,Something of a disappointment,"Maybe Play and 18 left me with expectations that were too high, but I don't expect an 'average' album from Moby, and that's what this is. There's nothing bad about any of these songs, but very few of them have anything of a spark either to lift them above the generic sound. The second disc doesn't justify the price difference - my advice would be to go to iTunes and cherry pick tracks rather than pay for the whole album."
4,KT Oslin music,My husband wanted this cd since he'd heard her music before. KT Oslin has a terrific voice and the music is great.
4,"Interesting, Good Read","While I enjoyed the book, the problem I always have with books of this type that contain several stories on the same subject, is that they invariably all kind of blur together for me.Of the 46 stories contained in this book, all but two were very well written and expressed, and several of the stories were unique enough to stand out in my memory.Enough detail is given that the reader feels well acquainted with the individual writing the story and with the other people mentioned in the story.I would have liked for the year, or the decade at least, to have been mentioned more frequently, it would have given a greater reference to what the lesbian environment was like for that woman at that time."
4,Read it alone (or with a friend),"Passionate encounters and near misses. Ribald and innocent. Incredible diversity and a some incredible stories. Best friends and exotic strangers. Women of all ages and class backgrounds, all over the globe, prove there is an infinite number of possible combinations when two women meet. (Or three women, as in Remi Newman's story ""Three Women In A Hot Tub"")As interesting as when they meet is where they meet. (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Bible camp, etc.)My favorite stories are G.L. Morrison's ""Firsts"" a time-traveling retrospective of first loves, including an elementary school romance with a polygamist's daughter; and the startlingly honest (and not surprisingly ill-fated) love story ""The Sounds of her Hands"" by Taj James."
4,Hot reading...,This book is full of interesting stories about lesbian encounters and what happens to the people involved. 70% of the stories are good.I would have enjoyed a bit more passion in some of the stories and a bit more romance in others but still a good read.
5,"Exciting, sensual and passionate","This was a great book, i have to say. I hate to read, but yet i read this long 350 page book in one month. I just could not put it down. It is well written by all these wonderful people who's lives are ventured into. It is neat to read about some ones lesbian life, and then compair it to my own. I have lived a short 15 years, and it is an honer to read about what i will experience in my future. I cant wait to get old and experience the great gift of loving women! I have had an interesting first experience with a women, one i will always remember. This book lets me see that i am not the only person who has had a bad ending to their relationship. It also lets me see that there is more to life than just one woman, there will be more, and the right one is out there somewhere,waiting for my touch!"
1,One early Hendrix performance only--the rest are fakes.,"Hendrix scholars (see Electric Gypsy) agree that only one of these tunes--She's a Fox--has Hendrix on it. It was recorded with Lonnie Youngblood in 1963 and has some lovely, Little Wing-style chording in it. The rest of these performances do not have any Hendrix on them, in the opinion of the most respectable discographers."
4,Carstairs Review Followup,"A year or so back, I had the pleasure of contacting and receiving communications from Herman Hitson, who is now living in Georgia, but not yet retired. We discussed his new music and some latter day ventures, but I couldn't resist asking about the old days with Jimi. As Mr.Carstairs proclaims, those sessions in question indeed were Jimi and Herman jamming in 1966. Herman remembers every note, and a story attached to each."
3,Not what I expected,"The Book isn't what I expected, It really doesn't show how to correct the Problem, except that it exists. Not worth the price."
4,Different Is Ok,"This book is about a colored boy who just moved into the neighborhood. At first nobody likes him, but then Luis (who is not popular) becomes his friend. Luis is trying to become popular with David Lear, considered a ""cool"" being mean to Luis and Dewitt (the colored kid) by stuffing food and junk into Dewit's locker, because he dosen't like colored kids or kids who aren't ""Cools"". I really liked this book because it told how some people are treated, or have been treated. It also said how being popular isen't everything."
3,the heat is on,"LIFE.IS.Not.FairLife isn't always fair. DE Witt Claeson moves into the neighborhood. School starts and DE Witt finds himself in a hot seat. He is not liked due to the color of his skin. The hoods trip him, trash his locker and call him names. Louis lives next door and wants to be friends with DE Witt. They walk to school together. Louis wants to become a cool, but is not accepted due to his friendship with DE Witt. Read the book to see what happens. I like this book because the conflicts are worked out and the friendship remains"
3,Could be a favorite,I love the shape of this pot but it is a bit larger than 12 inches. I actually bought it as a replacement for a much loved pot that came as part of a set and I have not actually been able to part with the much loved pot because this one does not have a cover. I have hunted unsucessfully for a cover large enough for it and even went so far as to contact the manufacturer who informed me they do not make covers in the size of this pot. If I could find a cover I would have given it 5 stars.
2,Arrived with some scratches around the top,"The pan arrived with some scratches around the rim of the pan - not what I'd expect from a brand-new item. It is also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but this will be an advantage for a larger household (I live alone.) I kept the pan and haven't used it yet, but it feels very hefty and seems sturdily built with the exception of the rim scratches, so as long as the insides aren't easily scratched, it could be an ok pan. I do think the price should be reduced, due to those pesky rim scratches."
2,Does not last long,"Bought this around Feb. 2012, and in just 6-8 months the non-stick layer starts to peel off, to a point it's totally sticky. In comparison, the Calphalon, Anolon ones I used last much longer, 2 years and still in decent shape."
1,Only good for few months,My phone had problems soon after purchase. It starts having trouble registering with base and tech support is not much help
3,Panasonic KX-TGA5223M phone review,"Great product, just be careful when you order the product make sure it comes with a jack to plug the phone to."
2,Reset...reset...reset,"I like the item, because of the small amount of space it takes up. However, it's annoying to have to constantly reset it when the lights go out. Sometimes I think the alarm is set and it is not. I really would not recommend this item to anyone."
4,"Good books, but make sure you do at least 200 sample qs","These are all you need in terms of study material. The performance tuning is a little weak, and so lose one star, but overall, quite good.The first book, on SQL, is excellent. All you need. For the other four exams, make sure to purchase some sample questions (200 per exam). The questions in the the second and third books are not representative of the questions on the exam. Basically, the real exam questions are much tougher - more scenario based."
4,Good for what they are,"Remember that these books are study guides. Certainly the books cover the necessary amount of topics for the exams. I would recommend getting sample questions, as the sample questions in the book are too easy compared to the real thing. Overall, well written and structured, I haven't used any other study material (bar sample questions) for the exams and am passing comfortably. Good purchase. Note: When you buy, the CD for the Perf. Tuning book may not work - all test links point to the one test. You should ensure that this is not the case in your copy, as fixing it one week before the exam is not possible (as Sybex are ignorant and unable to admit fault, but will replace eventually)."
2,Very bad for Backup and Recovery Section,I bought this kit about a year ago but I just got chance to read them. Everything is fine until I read the Backup and Recovery section. There are so many mistakes that I wonder how it got published. I know I should not doubt the author's knowledge about the principles of backup and recovery. But I could not understand why there are so many errors in it. It is very comfused to the readers who are new to Oracle. I hope the 3rd book won't be as bad.
4,Good preparation material,"This is good preparation material for OCP. Each chapters are very simple to understand, can complete each chapters within 3 hours. And at the end of each chapters, you can see some 20 questions. These questions and explanation will give you more clear idea. Only few of them have wrong answers. [Any way, if you able to identify it is wrong, then it is good sign for passing the exam also ;-) ]Out of 5 books, 3 books are good.(1) PL/SQL => Good, This book is enough to pass.(2) Achitecture and Administration => Good. This is enough.(3) Back-Up and Recovery => For basic concepts it is ok! Once you finished all the chapters, then go for Exam-Cram. This will help lot.(4) Performance & Tunining => Good. This is enough.(5) Network => For basic conepts it is ok!. Exam-Cram will do better.At conclusion, you can buy this kit. It is worth. Exam-cram and this kit is enough to pass all the exams.Wish you all the best."
3,"Good content and presentation, but....","I found the study guides well laid out and easy to read. The content was good, and the practice exams had the look and feel of the actual tests. However, there are number of typos/errors in the text, and several typos/incorrect answers on the exams in the book. On Network Administration ""bonus"" test contained on the CD, there is even a question which asks you to ""Choose all that apply"", but the answers are implemented with ""radio buttons"" which allow you to choose only one. In order to get the question correct, you must choose three. The problems have not prevented me from passing the OCP exams, but i think that the editors of an exam preparation book should pay more attention to accuracy."
4,"A pretty good kit, but......","Sybex is perfect about SQL, A&A and PT exams. B&R lacks information (specially RMAN stuff) and brings a lot of script listings not useful at all. NA chapters are good, though, even with a few errors.I had some problems with that kit:- Some questions had wrong answers (however, the explanations points the right ones).- In PT/NA cd, questions aren't separated sometimes (there were PT questions in NA tests)- The cd that came with PT/NA book was defective (only 1 test was available). However, Sybex promptly replaced it when I asked them.- On NA book, chapter 20 is missing. It appears only on cd (e-book).Anyway, it is a good purchase, if not the better, for OCP 8i. My advice is, use the SQL, A&A and PT without fear. Use NA carefully (along with Oracle manuals) and forget B&R book."
4,OCP,"Excellent starting book for aspiring DBA's.From the exam point of view,1Z0-001- Excellent book. Sufficent material and sample questions match the type in the exam.1Z0-023- Excellent book1Z0-024- Refer Oracle documentation also1Z0-025- Sufficent for passing1Z0-026- Refer Oracle documentation also"
5,Excellent for OCP exams,"I was roaming on this site , & finally I purchased this set before I started my exams.I finished my OCP DBA exams in 10 weeks.Writters have done excellent job for explanation ,very easy & fun to learn.Allthough I am not impressed by Books questions/Answers.I would advice others,In addition to reading this Set1.Get somehow Oracle 8i OCP Training material, Because exam question language matches with that Oracle training material.( questions are selected 100% from training material)2.Go to selftestsoftware.com, It has given me good confidence."
5,One fantastic set!,"This is one of the best sets I have ever heard. I listened to it yesterday at work (with earphones of course) and it took me all day to get through it. It starts from the beginning of his career and goes to the end. You can tell the difference and hear the maturing of his voice. One great set, recommend it to every Presley fan."
1,Tub Sprout,Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.
2,the MH cd and adobe,The book is of course excellent. However the cd is anoying because the authors somehow did not make it upwardly compatable with the newest version of adobe reader (7.x). Therefore one needs to remove the latest version of adobe reader and install version 6.x . The two versions of adobe reader are not allowed to exist on a windows system at the same time.
1,Machinery's Handbook 27th Edition CD (Machinery's Handbook (CD-ROM)),This is nothing but overly secured PDF file that takes more time to use than the old book. This is poorly done with no effort towards user interface. An internet connection is required for the live math to work. I use the book often and was exited to see it on CD. I am extremely disapointed by the CD version. I think I will stick with the book until they decide to actually make a PC version that is useful. I
4,Excellent book,"This book is very good for mechinical engineer. As an engineer,I often need to check some refernece or parameters for my working, I found this book is very useful after buying this book using couponsky.com discount. It not only provides basic material in mechanical, but also tell a lot about some advanced knowledge."
4,book review,"It was good, just as expected. Since it was used it had some shelve ware but they added a really bad ""used-book"" stamp in the side of the book. Besides that the book came fast and didnt have any other problems."
5,Great Deal,The book was brand new and $30 cheaper than the other book sales company. Delivery was very fast. Thanks.
4,Excellent buy,"As you might imagine, this book is indispensable to manufacturing engineers. The thumb indexes (absent in some previous editions) are useful. The only reason this book did not get 5 stars is because of the physical binding. The binding is simply not going to endure the daily use. Also, a couple of the pages were actually glued together."
1,Maybe ok if you never have to reload,"The CD is essentially just a pdf file. I have never used the interactive math portion. I can find the info just about as fast in the paper version. If you never have to reinstall the software I would say it rates about three stars. However, if your hard drive crashes and you have to reinstall it like me then it should rate a zero. To reinstall the software you have to call the publisher Monday thru Friday 8:30 to 4:30. After your done sitting on hold you give them a number thats on your screen which changes each time the screen loads. Consequently you better be sitting in front of your computer when you call. If you are really going to buy a CD version this is better than version 28."
4,Acrobat 7 is supported; patch required,"Industrial Press has a notice on their website that Acrobat 7 will now work as long as it is patched to version 7.0.5. Just an update from the earlier review which states that Acrobat 7 is not supported at all, which it probably wasn't when it was written."
3,Questionable value,"This really isn't a bad little (pocket-sized) book. It's well written and has good information. But information contained in Lonely Planet London or Frommer's, while not as extensive, will get you going. Then, if you'd like more information on a given museum, look it up on the internet.Knowing what it is now, I wouldn't have purchased it. But I'll hold on to it now that I have it."
3,Doesn't match what is stated on internet,I got this book because I now have a holland lop and thought it would be a good resource. There are several things in this book that doesn't match what is stated on the [...] The most glaring is on how to pick up a rabbit. The internet says to never pick up by the gruff the books says to do it that way. Who is right?????
4,The Rabbit Handbook,"The book is very informative. However, there should be more information on baby rabbits - all their stages of growth."
4,Pretty good!,"I received this book a few days ago and have basically read it from cover to cover.I feel the information in this book is for the most part accurate. One thing that I think should be added into all companion animal informative books (whether it be a book such as this, made for the average pet owner, or a book as a tutorial for beginning breeders) is more information on reasons to NOT breed your pet. The overpopulation of companion animals in this country is outstanding. By educating the uneducated regarding breeding this problem can be brought under control. I was happy to see that it was mentioned to not breed your pet, however I think a more in depth discussion of it should have been added.I thought the feeding guidelines were a little off as well, but I have seen much worse.4 stars to Karen Gendron and Michele Earle-Bridges for a great book!"
2,Shotgun writing style didn't work for me,"If I had to sum this book up in one word, it would be 'scatterbrained' ...I have referenced it a few times; most of those times I have found the topic I was looking for but the examples/steps presented in the book didn't actually work or at least didn't work the way I needed them to.I couldn't really find any logical flow to the book, either. It jumps from one topic to the next (maybe that is what they were striving for with the 'notebook' approach). To me, it made it difficult to use/follow. The index isn't bad, and since that was where I always went first I guess it doesn't matter too much that I was bouncing all over from chapter to chapter.I'd say this book was of below-average usefulness. Course, there are not a lot of 'beta' books out there, so you have limited choices prior to launch."
2,An expensive paperweight,"I really have not gained anything from this book. I bought the book having extensive 1.1 experience with a bit of 2.0 experience.The examples are way to simplistic. I can see this book being okay for an absolute beginner, but advanced developers aren't going to gain much.And all of the examples are in vb.net... *sigh*"
4,Listed Instructions,"I don't mean to rain on the parade of excellent reviews for this book but there is one thing you should know; this book heavily uses listed instructions, much like the Microsoft ""Step by Step"" books. I happen to be one of those people whose eyes glaze over when I see a list of instructions! (I tend to do much better with books that discuss technical features within the context of their usage.) If you are like me you should know that before you buy it.Having said that, many people find that this type of book suits their learning style (as we have seen in the other reviews), and I have no doubt that the content is excellent.Bill"
1,Tucson,"I never bought this item so I don't know why it is in my list of purchases. When I go to my account and ask for a list of what I've bought, Print Artist 4 does not show up. I'm curious how this one got on my list. I've used Print Artist in the past and I do not like it very much."
2,Pretty dire,I found this book very hard going. DesJardien's writing style was not very fluid at all and the book was an awkward read. It also lacked period detail which means this is not a good one to read if you are a true fan of the Regency era. 'The Reluctant Lord' started badly but did pick up. The characters were quite enjoyable though not compelling. It was basically an Ok read though I wouldn't read any more by this author.
3,More R&B than Jazz,"I bought this CD thinking it was going to be a jazz vocal group like the Mills Brothers. Although very similar in tallent, this is more of an R&B or pre-rock & roll group. None the less, it is very enjoyable!"
2,"adaft, amuck and asludge","I got the book mail order: I was looking for a reference on sailing.If you want to learn about sailing, not this book.It is what can be only called upper class yacht social humor.For a poor person related to an out-board motor mechanic,this is just grindingly class oriented humor.A book for indoctrinating rich people into in jokesthat really aren't too funny?"
4,"Sailing - A Sailor's Dictionary - A Dictionary for Landlubbers, Old Salts, & Armchair Drifters",A very funny book especially adequate to recreacional sailors. Anyone who loves sailing will like to read this book. Recommended to be read when the crew is joined
4,Very Controversial Book,"In the beginning I found Morning Song to be very unsettling, because these characters held raw emotions that most people would keep intact without acting upon. Then I realized that exploring these emotions is the mark of a good writer.I would not recommend this book to the faint of heart, or someone expecting a simple romance. It wasn't. Regardless, this book haunts me and now I can't find another book that grasps me as this one did."
4,good! love her older stuff...,"COmpared to her recent contemporaries, her older books are hardly recognizable as Robards.. that being said, this book is great. You will get sucked in and she actually pulls of a somewhat difficult plot line very well."
3,Sweet Tale Worth Reading,"This book is about a young lady who cannot help but fall in love with the sexy man that lands on her doorstep ~ on her widowed stepmother's arm, of course.This book is a page-turner b/c it has it all; scandal, shame, romance, adultery, murder, etc. The romance aspect of this novel was sweet b/c Jessie and Stuart had developed a relationship before they fell for one another.I'm only giving it three stars b/c Jessie's character seemed to lose her innocence and sweetness after she recognized her feelings for Stuart. Another reason I'm giving it 3 stars is b/c it was hard to believe Stuart was really in love with her."
1,Awful- even to a Robards fan,"I enjoy Karen Robards' books. They're fluff-- airplane, swimming pool reading. That's what I bought this one for. My expectations are for entertainment, not brilliant fiction or even a gripping storyline.But I think it's one of the worst of Robards' I've ever read. The plot is appalling-- an 18 year old girl is seduced by her 28 year old step father. (Alright, the husband of her stepmother, but still) Yes, yes, they fall in love. It is a romance novel, after all. But I still found myself astonished that this was an acceptable relationship and I'm very disappointed in this one. There is a disconcerting incestuous overtone, that simply wasn't good reading. So much so, that I won't resell this one or even put it on my bookshelf. It's going right into the garbage can. I won't be buying any more Robards novels for a while."
1,Crap infinity!!! -100 stars,"This is the most horrible excuse for a movie that I have ever witnessed. If I could give a negative star rating, I would. -100 stars!!!"
1,FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE BAD TASTE MOVIES,"this movie is about babs johnson(divine) the filthest person alive and connie and ray marbie(Mink stole and David Lochary) two challengers who are jealous of bads notoriety. DONT LOOK FOR BRILLANT ACTING OR A GOOD PLOT. THE POINT OF THE MOVIE IS TO SHOCK. IF THIS DOESNT, NOTHING WILL. DUE TO VIOLENCE AND NUDITY AND VERY POOR TASTE THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE RATED X AND NOT NC-17 RATING. YOU NEED A STRONG STOMACH TO WATCH THIS MOVIE"
1,what is this???,This film is probably the most boring and stupid movie ever. It is pointless crap at it's best. Pass on this one. Don't waste your time.
4,still shocking,"Divine and company at their vile best. VERY worth watching if you are a big fan of John Waters and his friends. Eggs Eggs. Chicken sex. Great hair. Turkey baster. I feel better knowing that even my most jaded friends are still disturbed by at least 2 scenes in this film. I like Multiple Maniacs better, in fact I like every John Waters movie better except Cecil B Demented (what a stinker)."
4,Pink Flamingos DVD,This movie is wild and crazy!!! You will enjoy watching this because it is unlike any other movie you've ever seen!! Sinful!!
4,"sick, sick, sick","This movie was absolutly vile, disterbing and wreched.......and yet I think I'll go out and buy it. It's not that the acting was up to par or that it didn't give me the dry heaves several times during the course of it all because it wasn't and it did. It has an unnautural lure to it, you just have to keep watching it to see what the hell could possibly happen next! The chicken sex scene still makes me nautious so I fast forwarded through that but surprisingly enough I could watch everything else with only the occasional vomit reflex or an ""Awww! that's disgusting!"". The movie was supposed to disgust you and shock you and make you sick so I can't really complain too much. If you do get sick easily pass on this film but if you are terminally sick, like me, pick it up quick!"
3,Poor Taste! Anyone?,"""Pink Flamingos"". This is the most vile film I have ever seen (not saying it wasn't entertaining). There is one disgusting scene after other. The film is about a women named Babs Johnson(Divine) who is known as ""the filthiest person alive"" and she want to keep that title! Oh, boy does she. There are always people getting in the way of somebody elses fame and this movie isn't an exception. There are two people, a married couple named Connie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole and David Lochary) who will do almost anything to stop them. This film has a bizzare cast and style that is not for everyone. This is Water's most explicit film and is definently not children or the weak-hearted(or stomached). MPAA Rating: NC-17(explicit sexual content, nudity, gore, violence, explicit example of poor taste, and intervals of strong language and dialogue)."
5,just hilarious!!!!!!!!,"i thought this movie was sooo outragous, crazy, and brilliant!!! i luuv the scene where DIVINE relieves herself right on someones front lawn, i laughed so hard, and i was shocked that this was in a movie i was so lucky to come across late night on sundance channel. i luved it so much that now i am buying the dvd and plan on passing it on to everyone i know!!! my favorite quote ""get my balls, mama"" HAAAAAAAAHAAAAAA!!!"
1,"Foul, foul, foul, foul","This was absolutely the one of most discusting films I've ever seen. If you are beyond sick and twisted, you'll probably love it. I had to be tricked into seeing it."
1,God help us.,"I watched this with four of my college buds. We are not of the faint of heart, yet half of us felt physially sick after viewing the film. I do not recommend this...for anyone. We actually underwent a purification rite afterwards, and none of us are Christians. If you do choose to view this 'movie', may whatever deity you believe in have mercy on your soul."
2,Do u think incest is funny?,"This is the dumbest film I have ever seen.its just not funny,i mean its cool to have lots of sex and nasty talk in movies,but I rented this expecting it to be a comedy. The only reason why I rated this a 2 is because I like the fat lady in the playpen. But everything else was just sick and senseless"
3,The album was not be new,"This album was a gift for a friend. He liked it very much. However I upset because the seller assured that the alabum was new, and yet the cd I received was used. If it was not new, the price was too expensive. If I had known that it was not new, i would probably not what would have bought."
1,Couldn't finish it...,"I tried, but I could not finish this movie. It started off quirky, mildly amusing, but just started getting foul and vile. I made it up to the cannabilism scene and gave up. I couldn't watch anymore and I feel I have a vey high tolerence for things like this. I didn't puke, but it deeply disturbed me and disturbs me still.Is this film worth it? Is it valid? Sadly, yes. I believe humanity is capable of anything and I'm sure there are actually people like the ones portrayed in this film. Sometimes you have to see the worst that humanity can dredge up from its diseased bowels to appreciate the best it can achieve.I say see it, or as much of it as you can handle. It will definitely change your view of the world one way or another, for better (not likely) or for worse (most likely)."
2,Not as Funny as You Think,"Really, not as funny as you would hope it would be... I only saw it once and that was out of curiosity. The mailman scene was rather funny; the rest is pretty sad... I'm no prude, it's just that there's really nothing there. I'd rather seen Waters parents reaction when they saw it. The onlookers in the film are pretty funny; I assume they had no idea what was going on. But what a sad claim to fame..."
5,Trailer Park Chic!,"UGH! If you love immorality, debauchery, and the twisted sense of humour that IS John Waters, you must see this. In a sense, it is ""Multiple Maniacs"" refined, older sibling. By the way, has anyone seen the Egg Man?"
1,Poor Chicken,"I love John Waters, but I REALLY didn't appreciate the chicken scene. Animal cruelty isn't art in my opinion."
1,Geez Menneez,"If you get off on people eating dog poo(or if you enjoy eating it yourself), then this is the perfect movie for you."
1,BARF,"Actually if they let me, I would go lower than 1 star. However, I have seen it...twice. Don't ask why, I couldn't tell you but it is still bad the second time. And the second time I was mainly watching the expressions on my friends faces which rated about ten stars so you be the judge."
