2,ordinary,"Nothing special.Just one among many others similar choices.If you are an architect, looking for a good source book and innovative ideas, that's not the best choice. Just an ordinary book..."
4,Fine & Dandy,"Arrived brand new, unopened, as expected. We're enjoying good quality Peanuts footage we haven't seen in years, including She's a Good Skate."
3,I Clapped at the End,"It's not exactly a classic, but ""She's a Good Skate"" definitely has its moments: Peppermint Patty wears sandals in the snow, the teacher talks in English for the first time (no wah wah wah), Snoopy wrestles with a cassette deck (very '80s), and Marcie invites Patty in for hot chocolate and cookies (yum). The bonus material, an episode of ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show,"" has its moments too despite a dreadful theme song. Sally as usual steals the show with edgy one-liners, and Lucy has a punchy line or two as well--pun intended."
2,Another half-baked Peanuts release...,Please don't buy this or they'll never release anymore chronological sets. The main episode is on one of the sets I have (think 70's PT 2 And the Saturday morning shows aren't all that great from what I've seen. Not that the main episode is one of the better ones either....Please go back and release 1980's PT1 and then PT2.
4,A joy to watch,I bought this because my children (aged 25 - 39) kept talking about it and with great fondness. Snoopy as the skating coach and where Woodstock steps in to save the day have been watched many times.
4,soccer shelf,"very nicely built, great for my needs. I just could not use it because was to small but a great product. waiting for my credit"
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to read this book since I thoroughly enjoyed HEG's The Forgotten Queen. Aware there is little to no information on Aethelflaed I was disappointed at the portrayl of her character. Lae seemed out of place: a woman with 20th centurty values stuck in the 10th century. Lae's worries about her balance between family and ""work"" and her desire for female solidarity were awkward. I believe this weakened the book considerably making it far from credible. I commend HEG for her Warrior Queen Series but did not see the need for modernizing her main character, a true warrior queen."
2,drat!,"I'm a long-time UB40 fan, and I have to say this album is the only major disappointment I've ever had from the UB's!"
1,Their worst effort yet,"I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time.I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but ""Homegrown"" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4.Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent ""Who You Fighting For."" Now that one is worth the $$$."
5,"El Scorcho, The Good Life, Why Bother?","Weezer has it all it the newest album- Pinkerton. Those three are the best songs on it. Across the Sea comes in a close second. Weezer is the best band ever. If you don't like Weezer, you've got problems."
5,fuel != creed,"I also believe that FUEL came out before Creed did, and accusing fuel of ripping creeds work is a mis-statement."
4,One of the best Ep's by far,"The Good Life Ep is definately one of the best EPs I have ever heard. It boasts a great mix Emo Core style from the Pinkerton era of Weezer. Along with the Good Life single, also included are an acoustic version of the song, ""Waiting On You"" (one of the band's best B-sides), ""I Just Threw Out the Love Of My Dreams"" a collaboration between Weezer and the Rentals, and an acoustic version of ""Pink Triangle"". Any Alt-Rock fan should buy this one. If you are not a Weezer fan before hearing this you will become one."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR DS LITE!!!","First, let me warn you, this case will damage your Nintendo DS Lite, and I STRONGLY recommend not buying it! After trying this product out, I noticed placing the DS unit anywhere near the magnets in the case causes the screen to completely white out and blink. I contacted Nintendo Customer Service, and they told me not only will this case damage your DS screens, the magnets in it used to keep the case closed will drain the color from your screens, AND quickly drain the life from your battery, not only per charge, but it will shorten the overall life of the rechargeable battery, causing you to have to replace it much earlier than normal. Like Nintendo says, stick to products specifically liscensed by Nintendo. You have been warned."
2,Flawed design,"The case was designed so your NDS unit can be played without removal from the case. The major problem with this is that there isn't any cut-out for the stylus (You can see this design flaw in the picture). If there was a cut-out, I would have given it 4 stars. Cut-out holes for the volume control and headphone are provided, however. I did not experience any of the screen troubles that the first reviewer reported relating to the magnetic nature of the closure mechanism."
2,Not bad but cheap,"okay - i bought the case and didn't know about the magnet issue.What sux is the lack of a slot for the stylus. so i cut that in...Anyways it becomes more trouble than its worth.The ""leather"" started ripping apart after only 6 months of use.In fact i stopped using a case all together for the DS lite."
2,Good case. Flase advertising.,"This is a great case. However when I ordered the black LEATHER case for my new DS lite, it arrived in the mail. The packaging says Leather case on the outside of it, however the case itself is CAMO color and NOT leather. The operation of the case is the same but someone dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Just be aware, if you want BLACK LEATHER you may want to try elsewhere."
1,This case = DS Lite return/repair,"My wife an I both have this case, and, while her case has caused no problems, I've had to return my DS, b/c the screen was permanently damaged by the magnet in the case lid. Buyer beware!"
4,"A great video, but....",This is a good video but if you like an instruction video with Gretzky I would definitly suggest that you bought Hockey My way that one is a lot better...
5,Wayne Gretzky is the best.,"Wayne Gretzky is the best he changed the way we play and watch hockey. Anyway the movie was great if you like hockey you'll love it, but you still don't have to be a hockey fan to watch this great movie. So I guaranty a great movie for you if you get this film."
4,very solid songwriting,"If you like Guided by Voices, you will like this very solid effort. The songs take interesting twists (signaled, usually, by strange changes in terms of guitar chords), and the melodies are instantly memorable and always pleasant--yet challanging. Kinda shows you that Bob Pollard of gbv fame maybe should rethink his attitude to overproductivity cause so many of his albums have total throwaways. i don't think doug gillard listens to Genesis the way Bob does (early Genesis--a good but very tricky influence). Also: you won't get sick of this CD--it keeps surprising you. I want to plug something here too: Robyn Hitchcock's Spooked. It is very haunting!"
5,Brilliant melodic rock from Cleveland's hidden gem,"Gillard steps out of the post-GBV shadows with Salamader, proving once again his brilliance in both melodic pop/rock/prog songwriting and performance. This album is a delight from beginning to end- introspective, spirited, honest and provocative with heart-on-your-sleave lyrics that ring true. Highlights are the driving ""Going Back (To You), the emotional and alternately lovely and creepy ""Present"", and the lightning bolt that is ""Symbols, Signs"". Here's hoping Salamander will not be overlooked in this age of Clear Channel, American Idol and corporate rock..."
5,Our new chosen curriculum,"As Director of a DUI counseling program for first and multiple offenders, I had been looking for a new curriculum based on the Stages of Change model to equip counselors with the latest and best tools to facilitate progress. This manual is the finest on the market and was chosen to update our program. Of particular help, are the introduction objectives, summary and implementation steps layed out to assist the counselor to focus and prepare each lesson. The initial 35 pages are especially useful to lay out the foundation of the entire process, procedures and underlying dynamics involved in assisting people to process through the various stages. I am certain this work will become normative as the primary source core material in many therapeutic programs."
3,Group Treatment for Substance Abuse: A Stages-of-Change Therapy Manual,I work in a 30 day IOP and I love the technique of Motivational Interviewing. 1/3 of this guide has enough information for me get my clients through treatment but most ideas are too simple and I find that most clients are already in the Action phase and are ready to address more advanced problems. This guide would be excellent for working with less experienced populations.
2,Addiction counselor comment,This is a great outline for first time treatment substance abusers. It is also helpful for those with co-occuring disorders with some minor adaptations.
4,Basic Starting Point for History of Lakota,"Hyde began rsearch in the 1920s and published in 1930s. He had dug into agency records, other written sources, and interviewd Indian elders. He gives a good account of Indian policy and its effects on Lakota, and he is quick to criticize, siding with the Lakota most often, but giving little credit to Indian memory of historical events.His style of writing is engaging, and he pulls no punchs in evaluating some of his sources as well as government agents and their policy."
3,Very Pleased,I am very pleased with my book. This is the second one I have bought. I gave it as a gift to a good friend who loves butterflies.
1,Waste of money,"Although these pool toys were a great idea, they broke right away. Inevitably, a kid would toss the toy and miss the water and the toy would hit the patio and break. They should be made from a more flexible or durable plastic."
2,seahorse dive toys break easily,"I bought these dive toys for our new pool based on the good reviews. Yes, they do sink gently and are easy to retrieve but two of the four are already broken. My boys told me that they threw them in the pool and missed and the toys hit the cement and the lower plastic that hold the weights broke and the weight fell off. Disappointing. We also have some other fabric dive toys that are holding up much better that these sea horses. :("
3,surprisingly uninspiring,"The first is pretty good, but the 9th symphony, whatever Shosty's hidden motives for writing it, is pretty mediocre, and one of his worst symphonies in thie writer's opinion."
4,The evil doctor lives again.,"I was thrilled to death to find these titles in print--although I regret I didn't get the entire series while they were still available. Wonderful, wonderful books, many of which haven't been printed in years; now I want the rest of them!I should mention that my copy had an AWFUL typo in it--about 3 paragraphs of the first book, inserted incorrectly into the second book. But considering these titles are virtually unavailable anywhere else, I was still happy with my purchase."
3,Great product- not great Amazon fulfillment,"These toaster pastries are great. They taste just like pop tarts, but are organic so I can feel slightly less guilty about feeding this stuff to my kids.The order fulfillment is not great assuming this is a personal order and not a buisness. Toaster pastries, like most processed foods, have a very long shelf life. The order I got in the mail was an entire case of toaster pastries with an enjoy by date ONE month away. A case of toaster pastries set to expire in a month... Not so useful for a family with just 2 kids."
5,My kids eat these like candy,"My kids, and truly my husband and I too, love these pop tarts. They are super soft and great without toasting them. They are a convenient snack and a great source for breakfast!"
4,Well worth it,"Very good mix of downtempo with a positive vibe - nice to work to as not too drowsy - worth it mainly if you have none of the series, which has 8 volumes, but at 2 discs for under 20 bucks worth it generally too."
5,GREAT DIVING TOY,"Excellent diving toys for ALL ages. Even I enjoy diving and grabbing these with my daughter. The 12 feet and 15 feet area at our pool is challenging for my 10 year old but she gets them. We exchange the turtles for quarters and she really goes after them, then."
4,"Tough to open, but lots of fun","When we first received these eggs, we had a tough time getting them open. My 9-year-old eventually found the trick - put them between your palms and sqeeze hard til they pop! Once we figured this out, the kids (ages 9 and 12) have had a great time with them, and so have their friends. In addition to the games listed on the instructions, they have thought up several more variations. Looks like we're going to get a lot of use out of these.I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because of the initial difficulty in opening the eggs, and because the turtle colors aren't great. Our turtles are dark blue and black - a little hard to tell apart. I wish they had used a different color on the blue turtles."
3,NIce idea but cheaply made,Nice idea and kids love it ..BUT.. the one black turtle looks just like all the other green ones- especially when wearing goggles. Should make the one odd one stand out more. One of the weights was broken on arrival and since then 4 more have come loose. Egg box hinge broke within a week.
5,Perfect for a gift,Bought for my hubby and he was pleased with the weight of the sword/workmanship. I would recommend and would buy again.
4,Karon's characters give insight into small town life .,"The endearing characters in Jan Karon's second book in the Mitford series, 'A Light in the Window', have given me insight into my own small town parish. Often as I read I find myself recasting the script with the folks I know. Jan Karon may not win a Pulitzer prize in literature for these books, but she has won a warm place in the hearts of many men and women who enjoy a gentle read before retiring. Any book which makes a person smile or laugh out loud performs a fine service. After so many murder mysteries, war novels, and expose books, this genre is a pleasant relief."
1,A Common Life - The Wedding Story by Jan Karon,"I've read the five prior books in the Mitford series by Jan Karon and loved every one of them. I waited all winter for this book to be published and couldn't wait to read it. I don't know what Jan Karon was thinking about - perhaps money. But, it wasn't the contiuation of the wonderful stories in the Mitford series. All this book does is retell the story of Tim and Cynthia's engagement and marriage in a more detailed way and some perspective of some of the people in Mitford. Not in any way up to her uplifting previous five books. When the next ones are published, I'm going to take them out of the library before I add it to my collection. I'm sorry one star was the lowest rating. I'm so disappointed!"
3,Reading more about Mitford because my book club wants me to!,"""High, Green Hills"" is the second ""Mitford"" book I've read. While I find them entertaining and relaxing, I think my time would be better spent reading other things. I may read a third the next time I need to rest or am in the hospital. But, if my Book Club insists - that is what I will do."
5,These High Green HIlls,I love all things mitford and no one book is better then the next. Karon is constistant in her writing and they are a positive in a now very negitive world.
5,Jan Karon Books,"Mom and I have ordered Jan Karon's large print and audio books. While the audio books were all new, some of the large print books were used.All books arrived quickly and in nice shape.We appreicate Amazon. com."
4,"These High, Green Hills by Jan Karon","Had a bit of a problem with delivery, but after talking to book owner, it was resolved and was a mail problem."
4,not bad,"I have more complaints with this book than I did with the first two, though I still enjoyed it overall. I got very tired of Father Tim's constant contemplation of his new marriage, how much it had changed it his life, and how he could hardly believe his fortune. How had he survived all these years without Cynthia? How could he have not known what he was missing? And so on, over and over and over again. This book seems filled with more cheesy dialogue, old-fashioned language, and quaint expressions than the first two. And it seemed to me that nearly everything written about Father Tim's and Emma's new computer was completely made up by someone who had never used a computer before. However, all criticism aside, I still enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the fourth one."
4,Just as good as the first two in the series. Excellent!,"This series[Jan Karon, Mitford] is one of the best I have ever read. If the whole world turned off the TV, and read these books, it would become a place like Mitford!These High Green Hills is just as good as the first two in the series. Our pastor gets a little older, a little wiser about himself and his parish but does it with a smile the whole way. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could see life as such an adventure the way Father Tim does? I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is tired of reading legal murder mysteries. This is light hearted reading at its best"
2,Not What I Expected,"After reading the cover description, I did not feel that this book was anything like the cover portrayed it to be.I don't like mushy Regency romances and that's what this turned out to be. If you like them, this book is for you. If you don't, then forget it."
3,weaker than hoped,"The remixes are less than hoped for, no real imaginative elements. Glad to have it for the price but had hoped for something more."
5,Worth picking up...for sure,"This is a great single, all in all. It's a very emotional song and is better than a lot of album work. The remixes aren't any big deal to me and I couldn't care less about Korn. The instrumental is cool though...like a karaoke version to sing along with. For its price, it's worth it for an import. Pick it up, you'll like it."
3,Could've Been Better,"This song bridges the gap between AntiChrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals. Overall, one of Manson's best songs and videos. However, what the ...is Korn doing on here?! The remixes are alright."
2,Not for young nursers,"While I do appreciate that this product is good for preventing gas and that it has a tri-flow nipple, it proved much too fast, even at the slowest setting for my 2-month old nursing son! I pump during the day for him and provide him bottles while I am at work, and the speed was much too fast for him, even at the lowest setting. It is a quality product, so if you are only using bottles, it will probably be wonderful!"
3,"Not bad...a bit dated, though.","This wasn't a bad DVD set. The jokes were a bit dated, as this was taped in 1999 and 2000 (jokes about Y2K? Yeah...it's a bit old).A word of caution. If you're buying this for Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, or Larry the Cable Guy, don't. The material they present here is the same the present in the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" movies. And that's understandable. They have to try out and develop their material somewhere, so why not Nashville?The other comics were pretty decent, too. Overall, this was pretty clean comedy, and family friendly. No ""F"" bombs, but a li'l profanity. Nothing kids probably haven't heard before.Enjoy two hours of comedy at a decent price. Yes, ""Blue Collar"" was better, but you'll pay more, too.If I could've given this 3 1/2 stars, I would've."
2,Terrible as most sony products,"I bought this Sony D-ej200 in Japan and realy disappointed about Sony and knew they were not much different from Japanere products. Looks beautiful but they really stinks.Playing normal CDs is OK but whenever I try to play my CD that I burned with mp3 file in it . It often stops. I thought it had smoenthing to do with my CDs so I burned it again but I got the some results.Even though in menual it say you can play CD/RW format,but in fact it' impossible to play CD/RW format.The remote controller has broken after using just a few days. It such a piece of crap. Even if I Push and Sound mode button is . they do not go up so I cannot change the sound type any more.Plus the warrenty is not valid in my country. You might not want to buy electrnoic gagets in foregin country even if they are cheap.Don't buy this product."
3,Fine while it worked,"The overall sound quality was good if:- you use it with some decent headphones (those supplied are garbage)- keep the ""bass-enhancement"" (a pointless waste of electronics) switched offHowever, the unit packed up after a few months moderate use. It was eventually replaced by Sony after ALOT of hassle."
2,"Sleek Design, problematic the rest","Sound is not impressive, probably it requires better acoustic headphones. Design and remote are the best part out of it.Overall quality is questionable, this is the second unit that won't charge the batteries after 3-4 charges (it lights up after pressing stop/charge then light goes out) and batteries are empty."
1,"Awful formatting, awful text","This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever used. The formatting in the textbook is completely counter-productive and terrible to use. The titles and beginning of every section is almost indiscernible from the text of the chapter making navigation tedious and difficult. Important equations are not boxed or easily findable in the text, and example problems are in the same typeset as the instructional material, making reference to a previous chapter very difficult.The book changes tone several times within a chapter with off-putting dry humor that seems forced and out-of-place.Overall, this book made learning differential equations much harder than it needed to be and should be reformatted at the very least."
1,Don't waste your money.,I bought this product and it did not last two weeks. The sorrounding clips are flimsy (quite like those on CD jewel cases) and they're all broken.
1,The picture was a deceit,"I thought I was ordering a phone cover. However, what I got was a plastic phone protector. I was highly disappointed with the product. As I write now, I am not using the product"
4,Babylon,"A significant portion of our knowledge of the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia comes from non-literary sources, such as art and architecture. As such, this volume provides a large selection of black-and-white illustrations, which are themselves almost worth the price of entry. The text is also very interesting, if a bit dry. It is essentially a history of Mesopotamia from the time of Sargon to the rise of the Achaemenid empire, focusing, obviously, on the city of Babylon. It is written in a scholarly but accessible manner, though some parts might be tough going for someone totally new to the subject."
2,Really Quiet,"People said it is quiet, but it's REALLY quiet. Its stock quiet. It sounds a little better than stock at higher RPMs but it doesn't sound great. I don't know if thats because I put it on my 08 VW passat which has 2.0 liter turbo 4 cylinder engine. Maybe it sounds better on a V6 or V8. The guy who installed it told me we can mek it louder by removing the resonator."
5,awesome look great quality,awesome sound had a muffler shop install them pretty good price take note the core size is 2.5 inches even though the inlet outlet is 2.25 to 4 inches
5,great kodak colors!,"this is a solid point and shoot camera. easy to use, it produces pictures with rich, vibrant tones kodak is famous for. there is also a printer dock that recharges the batteries (no need to remove the battery--just put the camera on top of the dock). the dock also prints at the touch of a button. no computer is necessary, but if you hook the dock to one, you can even send e-mails! the prints have a clear coat so they don't run or smudge, like some ink jets prints do.anyhow, a great camera at a great price."
5,The best (top of the line!) camera I have ever had!!,"This camera is very nice. It is so easy to use. And the pictures are wondeful! Kodak really made an awesome camera! The camera, dock (not printer dock), and the kodak software are very nice and easy to use. Great cameral for any and all events!"
4,FANTASTIC!!!!,"This camera is easy, takes GREAT pictures, and is an all around great digital camera. If I had to state any drawbacks, it would be that the flash range makes it difficult for indoor long shots (kids concerts, kids indoor sports etc). But, other smaller compact digitals have the same problem, so unless you want to get a camera with a detatchable flash (and lenses) this a great choice. The lithium rechargagle battery lasts a lot longer than other rechargables. I absolutely LOVE this camera."
2,I now own 2 digital cameras. (no thanks),"Three problems:1)NiCd battery holds a insufficient charge, lasting for only a few minuets.2) Auto focus provides infocus pictures about 50% of the time with no ability to use a manual focus.3) It has completely died.Two silver linings:1)The customer service people are as helpful as they can be and rapaired the focusing problem for the cost of shipping. Upon return they gave me a free photo printer.2) For the short time that it did work (kinda) the camera had an abundance of features."
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT EASY.","I have had my Kodak Z760 for a few months now and even though it is a great camera, it's not as easy to use as it might seem to be. You have to know a litte about photography to really get great results from it. I have a Nikon 3100 and I found it to be a lot easier to use. You do have a thousand options to work with the Z760, but it does require some basic knowledge about photography. It's not a ""beginner"" camera.One of the things I love about this camera is the battery life. I love my Nikon but I hate its batteries life. The Kodak Z760 battery life is just wonderful. You don't have to recharge it every time you take pictures using the flash.The picture quality is great. Overall, it's a great camera. You only have to dedicate a little bit of your time to really learn how it works; and perfect everything the camera has to offer you."
2,Not worth the repair,"I enjoyed this camera for about 13 months, and it was very user friendly. Two cons: It does not take very good quality pictures in low light situations and the mode dial ceased working altogether. The camera will not even turn on now. Estimated cost of replacing the mode dial is $125 which is 60% of the initial cost of the camera and more than a new purchase of a Z760 today. Because of the cost of repairs, I will not be buying another Kodak to replace my relatively new camera."
4,A beautiful little book!,"I bought this for my 11-year-old who reacted by baking muffins all summer long. The pictures are beautiful, the instructions clear, and the recipes delectable. A sweet little book that inspires one to bake."
3,Traps Dirt... =*(,"I bought this case for my iPod 60gig Video right when I bought my iPod. The case looked great and I was looking for something solid to keep any dings out of my iPod. It works well in that it kept the scratches away, but if you tend to use this case, clean your iPod often. There is no top or bottom closure, so dust and little particles can and will get inside through the top and bottom. When they get trapped for a while, they get VERY difficult to clean off. I have a nasty small gunky thing on my screen now and I can't seem to rub it off.This thing comes with a nice circular shield for your click wheel. But I seriously recommend the screen shield to use inside this to keep stains or gunk from your screen. It gets frustrating when you buy a case and your $400 machine gets dirty because you try to protect it. If I could, I would use a soft case, be advise, clean often unless you don't care much for your iPod."
4,Nice Loretta Young film !,Paula is an enjoyable drama Loretta Young did shortly before her great television series.She does well in a role that has her not only look beautiful but do some good acting.Tommy Rettig is the boy she helps and makes whole.If you love Loretta Young don't miss this film!
5,Buy this and Kondrashin On the Russian Disc Label,",then you'll have two of the *great* interpetations of this startling, amazing work! Yevtushenko is also very good here, very interesting indeed!"
5,An Excellent 13th,"This is an excellent recording of a powerful work. The orchestra's sound is first rate, and the individual instruments shine throughout. The percussion at the beginning of III is very effective and does an excellent job of depicting the text. The choir sound is very good, but the soloist's voice could be a deeper sounding bass. Masur's soloist often performs as a bass-baritone and his voice has a slightly higher sound than other soloists. Yevtushenko's reading is also powerful. The chance to hear the poet read his poem ""Babi Yar,"" coupled with this outstanding performance, equals a CD that is hard to turn down. I agree to also add Kondrashin's account of this work on Russian Disc to your library, if you can find it."
2,Great -- if it worked,"This was offered during the Friday Sale for an unbelievably low price, and so I bought one to try it out. It worked great for the first bag -- and then the vacuum mechanism immediately stopped working.We had bought a ton of food to store in these bags, and so we completed the storage process using my friend's more advanced model. From using my friend's version, I realized that this is a great concept (and product). But given the immediate failure of this entry-level version, I would give some pause before buying a reconditioned one."
2,PowerPoint 2003 by Grauer,"Very frustrating. They have stopped including the CD with the Comprehensive edition and instead tell you to download the lessons that go with the book. Unfortunately the lessons are not at the website posted in the book. I spent 2 weeks trying to get someone, anyone at Prentice Hall to help me. I finally got the lessons (at http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_grauer_exploring2003-1, I think) but there were multiple versions and Im still not sure what all's missing. The first 10 pages are just plugs for other Prentice Hall computer books. Finally the lessons are.. OK. It lead me through the steps to create nice .PPTs, but there is no glossary, and the index is very thin. This is no comprehensive ""bible"" for looking up specific problems. It's much more of a ""one step at a time"" do in sequential order book."
3,"War World v1, The Burning Eye","The first of many and a good read, J Pournelle was ahead of his time when he put together this book. Many of his and his coauthors stories and issues ring true today and fit well in the sci-fi genre. If you haven't read this one you need to to get the full flavor of the series"
5,Small But Mighty,"This small book, ""Pitfalls In Genealogical Research"" by Milton Rubincam, paperback ISBN 10: 0916489280, is a wonderful inexpensive gift for anyone who is interested in genealogy and is indeed full of pitfalls in genealogical research. It is excellent for beginners as well as advanced genealogists who have sometimes forgotten a few of these common mistakes or pitfalls."
5,Still memorable 40 years later,"Saw a special on Nova about tracing the DNA of the 18th Dynasty to find out whether inbreeding caused its fall with the last pharaoh in line, King Tut. (Very touching---did not know there were two fetuses/stillborn children in his crypt.) Remembered how much I loved reading and rereading ""The Lost Queen of Egypt"" and I am amazed that it's not in print! Yes indeed, let's try to get the publisher to do a new editon."
2,not what expected,I think the seller should have given a more detailed rating such as this film being soft core and not having any explicit sex scenes. The story seems to start out very sensual and misleads the veiwer the women are drawn very sensual but there is no hardcore sex.
3,The manga was much better....,"to those who have actually known this title as futari h (or futari ecchi), this is one very disappointing adaptation. It's not terrible, and, to be honest, it does have some good things about it. Again, not too bad, but lacks the things one who sees the cover would expect. If you want some soft-core stuff, it's actually pretty decent, and I'm actually really glad there's no English track, because of the piss-poor voice acting in many other titles that exist. overall, it's one of those ""the manga was much better"" type products."
4,Blood on the Dance Floor: Another Great MJ Song,"Look, Blood on the Dancefloor is one of MJ's Finest Songs. But I really Dug TM's Switchblade Edit (Track #2) because of its upbeat tempo and great intro. It truly is one of MJ's best Re-mixes."
1,Do not purchase this item,"Plese, Do not purchase this item.I received a CD Album Blood on the dance floor.I purchased a vinyl single, but they didn't dispatch the correct item. it is a wrong item."
4,Surprisingly good.,"Usually these ""Somebody Vs. Somebody"" One-shot specials that Marvel does have boring plots, inconsistancies in character behavior, and over-the-top meaningless fight scenes.This one was surprisingly well done. Both Wolverine and Spidey's characters are true to form. Spidey cracks jokes and, as usual, gets in a little over his head by trying to do what's right. Wolverine proves just how much of a [tough-guy] he is, and also says and does things that show that inside he is a very intelligent man who also understands how to manipulate people.The story is an entertaining and self-contained one, yet still one that manages to have far-reaching implications in the Marvel Universe; traits that all Marvel comics creative teams should try to emulate.The dialogue and art are well done. Chronologically, this story takes place soon before the ""Wedding of Spiderman"" storyline."
3,Bad shipping,The shipping package was extremely big for the item and the courier company charged me too much extra money because of the volume of the package...
2,Poor quality,"When I plug in my iPod to charge and listen at work, it sends electric shocks to my brain. and when im listening on the go the left and right sides fade in and out as the jack moves around, probably because its not goldplated."
4,Great earbuds for the money.,"These Fontopia earbuds are well made earbuds that fit nicely in your ear. I found they fit my ears better than the Apple in-ear earbuds, and they never fall out when I ride my bike around town or campus. I like the shorter than average cable too, because it doesn't have too much slack when I plug it into my iPod remote contol.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that evert now and then, some frequencies distort at moderate volume levels.The only product I would recommend over these Fontopia earbuds are the Philips HE591 and HE592 Surround Sound Earbuds. I never had any distortion problems with those headphones, and the sound is a little fuller than the Fontopias."
3,Great earphones. Bad quality/durability,"I love the sound of these earphones. They performed quite well considering they're only 13 dollars. They also are quite comfortable to me despite the comments saying how it scratches your ear. It takes getting used to, which I have. They fit snugly and the quality of the sound is great.The real gripe I have with these earphones is the durability. I've been through 2, 2 pairs of these earphones and they keep breaking. I don't abuse it, and I use the case provided. This will be my 3rd pair of earphones and I sincerly hope they will last, it always breaks with 1 earphones not producing sound and the other does, and the first one just broke completely with both unable to produce sound. Very disappointed in SONY's quality control.But besides this gripe, the quality of the sound is excellent and the value of the cost makes up for the horrible quality control Sony provides."
4,decent sound at a decent price,"no better , possibly less sound quality than the ipod buds i was trying to improve upon.the bud does fit into the ear with an angled soft rubber thing that may improve the aim of the sound and may provide some protection from moisture while running or wearing a hat skiing."
4,Good but not great,"I had already owned Sony Mdr-E10Lp/Blk which are around 8 dollars. Trust me I find no difference in sound quality between these two types of earphones. These are actually very top quality earphones and I like it that they adjust well to my ears than most earphones I have wore in the past. However, if you are looking for high value and cheap earphones go for the Sony Mdr-E10Lp/Blk which are cheaper and actually wonderful for sound quality and durability."
3,In the Ear phones,"Great sound when I can get them to stay in my ear. Not good if you run. Also, upon extended session of use (say > 0.5 hours) sometimes they begin to irritate or hurt my ear and I need to fiddle with them to get the comfortable. For a few minutes, when walking or sitting, they are fine, and the sound is great. For long use or activity, not comfortable and not useful."
3,Sony headphones,"Sound is good. The earpieces, however, should have some type of cushion or padding to ease placement in the ear and also secure them in the ear. They can shift when user is perspiring."
4,ear phones,These earphones have awesome sound for the price. I have purchase three or four other earphones for the same price for crapping sound. These earphones have great bass sound. The negative is that I have a hard time fitting them in my ears and staying in my ears. But overall I like them
3,Better than expected,"I've had these for several months, and that really surprises me. The wires are thin. They feel so delicate that I'm constantly living in fear that I'll break them. Yet they still haven't snapped, so perhaps they're made better than I'd thought.Sound quality is great for the price (I paid $16). And they fit my ears perfectly.**UPDATE**It's now been maybe a year since I purchased these, and overall I'm still pleased. The only real drawback so far is still the flimsy wire, which, although it has not yet been broken or damaged, has become worn by friction associated with the little piece that holds the two earbuds together when not in use."
2,I wish I didn't get them,"I don't know, I guess it depends on your ears. I always liked and trusted Sony. I will like and trust Sony in future, but these simply weren't made for my ears. It hurts just trying to put them in. And the sound isn't that great (if you think this sound is the best, you simply don't know what good quality sound is), quite average. But if they fit you ears, I guess it's not a bad deal for the price."
2,"Good, but didn't fit my ear","Used them while working out. Spent more time pushing them back in my ears. Base response good, OK product, but not for me. I bought Koss ""Sparkplug"" ear headphones, they are outstanding."
2,Discomfort makes them not worth it.,"While the sound quality on these ear buds is good, they are highly uncomfortable. I agree with several other reviewers that there is no comfortable position in which to wear these. I have had the earbuds for several months and found myself going back to the $20 Sony earbuds I bought with my last mp3 player.These are not a good value since they can't be worn for any length of time."
2,Its not great..,"After I bought a Creative Zen M, I wanted to buy earbuds that might enhance the player's bass. I chose these after doing some research. It was a mistake. These earbuds are average. My mp3 player's original earbuds (made by creative) are more comfortable, provide better bass and conduct better sound in general. These earbuds are good if you want decent quality, but if you want superior sound quality, look elsewhere. Additionally, these earbuds produce a weird feeling in your ears because of how deep they go. It was not too annoying at first, but you have to wonder if they are completely safe. Finally, the wire is too short for running or any activity other than sitting or walking."
5,All I wanted.,"Headphones are great. Audio is OK, I am not a sound engineer to tell how good the sound is, but they fit my ears perfectly. I am not sure how I was able to live before with the regular, round, non-ergonomic headphones that made me jam the a silicone tubes up into my brain to make the sound audible, or to make them stay in place. Buy them!"
5,Well Pleased,"These things have some serious sound with out being too loud. Rich base clear high end. You can hear tones and words you don't from system speakers. As with any earphone, you have to fit them in the ear correctly. One thing to watch for is bending the rubbery extinction. If you do it will decrees the volume on that side. Well worth the buy. Makes even the smallest mp3 player sound great. Enjoy."
2,Any accessories to make these fit?,Just bought two pairs because of the great reviews. They hurt and won't stay in my ears. Also the cord is so short.
5,These are the earbuds to get!,"Wow! I never realized that earbuds affected lots when you listen to music. Man, these earbuds are outstanding. They are really bass boosters, and they won't fall out. They are made of really comfortable material, and the tip is soft rubber. The cord doesn't get in the way, and the sound quality is great!The sound quality is really great, and it immerses you well into the music.There aren't really any bad things about this. Unless you are a really tall person, the cord length is very nice.GET THESE EARBUDS!!!"
2,Very Uncomfortable!,"This is a good headphone at a very low price. The problem occurs to me is that it is too uncomfortable. Every time I use it to listen to the musics, after 15 minutes, my ear hurt badly, even cause the pain to my head. I love listening to the music while I'm writing my paper, but this product completely keep me away from the keyboard. As a result, I don't recommend this product to you guys."
3,"Great fit, but keep breaking after less than a year","I have really tiny ears, and these are the only buds that will confortably stay in my ears when I'm jogging or working out. I love that part of these headphones, however, I'm on my 2nd pair now, and after less than a year, the sound in one bud goes out!! It all starts by making a crackling noise, then the sound goes out completely in one bud, and only goes back if you hold the wire a certain direction (a connection problem?).I thought it was just a defective 1st pair, but no, this is the 2nd pair that have had exactly the same problem. Once is a coincidence, but twice borders on being a trend."
3,Good sound for the right ears,"I bought these headphones to use while running on a treadmill. The left bud tends to work it's way out of my ear while I'm running. The sound is very good though, and they would probably work well for someone with smaller ears or for a non-runner. Decent headphones for the price just not for my intended purpose."
2,disappointing,"I got these for my 14 year old son who loves music. They were fine for the first few weeks but broke very soon after. He still uses them, but keeps ""fixing"" the earpiece. I wore them when they were new and found them very uncomfortable in the ears. I liked the JVC HAF120A Gumy Headphones that I got for myself much better, and cheaper too."
3,"Good sound, doesn't stay on ear while running","I bought these headphones primarily so I can run while listening to music. The headphones provided by Apple iPod's jiggle too much and fall off while running. I figured these would stick in the ears better and stay there. Well, overall, these headphones have great sound. The bass is deep and sound is full. There is noticeable improvement in sound quality over the default iPod headphones. However, while I run, they did not stay on my ear as consistently as I would've hoped."
3,"good sound, but tough to wear","It gives you good sound, but its plastic edges are a little rough to wear, especially hurt my left ear."
3,Great sound...but uncomfortable.,"For the price, these are a great set of in-the-ear headphones. The sound quality rivals much more expensive models. The design also makes it difficult to accidentally yank them from your ears, which is a plus. However, the comfort level leaves a lot to be desired. The rubberized inserts are too hard to conform properly to the ear canal making them uncomfortable to have in for any length of time. So if comfort is important, look elsewhere."
3,Pretty Average,"The headphones is shaped to fit the the indentations of your ears. They do not fall off as easily as those cheap earbuds that typically comes with your MP3 players, but they do fall off. The sound of these headphones is pretty average too.Overall, this product is pretty average, hence the three stars rating."
1,Uncomfortable fit,"You get what you pay for. Don't get these earphones unless you try them first. I haven't found a person who feels their comfortable in their ears. Sound quality is pretty good, but not nearly has good as high quality earphones like shure & zen earphones."
2,Spend a little more money for better headphones.,"I am here now ordering a replacement for these which I bought at a nearby electronics store. First of all, they do not stay in the ear very well at all. The cord is too short and the sound is very lacklustre. Spend a little more money for better headphones."
4,Sony headphones,The headphones work great and have great sound quality. The only negative that I can say about them is that they rate about a 7 in comfort fit. They are a bit large and do not offer any type of sponge covering or optional sizes.
4,not very good,"Instead of these headphones, I recommend the the $12.99 Sony fontopia. They are much better, cheaper, and you can find them in stores easily (so that if you don't like them, you can easily return them). You can even get them with the inline volume control for $15; those sound much better than the MDR-ED21LP."
5,small price for big performance,"After reading thru dozens of reviews for different earphones, I finally gave in & ordered two pair for my wife & I. Turns out I made the correct choice! These sound great, are easy to insert, & the build quality is impressive. I LOVE the ""rubberized"" feel of the wires, they do not get tangled up nearly as easily as others I've owned & they feel like they are sturdy enough to last a good long time. Sound quality wise , they seems pretty balanced overall, no real emphasis at any one frequency. Perhaps a teensy bit reduced in bass response, but I think this is more due to getting them fitted right versus any real shortcomings. Besides I would rather have less bass response with smoother overall response anytime. Nice job, Sony!"
4,My favorite earphone.,"I continue to buy the Sony Earbuds year after year. They're reasonably priced, are the most comfortable to me, but more importantly seem to offer the best sound quality. I am able to hear many musical details using the earbuds that don't seem to be audible using other speakers (like my car). They are my favorites."
2,All I can say is ouch!,"I bought these headphones for my iPod because I had a problem keeping the iPod ones in my ears. Maybe I have really small ears but these Sony headphones really hurt. I find them terribly uncomfortable after just a few minutes. I was also really disappointed with the sound. It sounds like a lot of static. I tried adjusting the bass/treble/vocals (which changes from song to song or artist to artist) to get better sound, but it's a lot of work just to get rid of static that shouldn't be there in the first place. The iPod headphones have much better sound but I need a better fit. I will have try again..."
3,awkward-fitting,"I bought these since my boyfriend had them and loved them, but they're a bit awkward-fitting for me / my smaller ears. There is a small protrusion, which makes them ""in-ear"" but they're not really in-ear, which is why I wanted them. However, when I have them in for a while, they make my ears sore. I tried putting them in different ways (and they were on the correct ear) but they don't sit quite right. Sound quality is good and crisp, but I can only have them in for about 20-30 mins before I have to take them out for a while. Maybe I'm more of a headphone-type of person, or maybe they do fit awkwardly for smaller ears."
5,they do the the job!! good quality,I wanted to buy one of those.. headsets that fit into ur ear to ease the volume needed ... found this one for cheap and they work great!! i have them for over a yr now.. and still Great!! i use them regularly... 1-2 a weeks.. but they havent ripped or broke.. so totally worth the buck
5,IN THE GYM,"The only reason is choose to upgrade is because the Ipod ear phones do Not stay in my ear while working out and more specifically Jogging. So i upgraded to JBUDS First. Wow how disappointed I was. Any how after a bit more research I cautiously purchased these. I CAN""T believe how great they stay in. I can jogging, jump, pretty much any physical action without having the sweat loosen them up. Yes If you wear them for an extended period (3hrs+) of time they make your ear sore a bit. You gotta give a little to take a little. Plus they have great bass. AN Absolute BUY If you need WORKOUT ear buds !!"
3,Possibly defective product,When I took these headphones out of the package i was expecting everything to go wrong. I've always have bad luck with sony earbuds. So i plugged them in to my iPod and what do ya know. They scratch pop and cut out in certain sides when the plug is nudged a slight bit. Yes it is plugged all the way in and when i plug my sennheiser hd457's in they work just fine. Im going to return these and see if i cant have better luck with another brand. But when I could hear them the audio was phenomenal. Highly reccomended if you dont get a bad pair.
2,disappointed,"I purchased these to use with my new IPOD, as I had heard the included earphones weren't too good. These weren't even as good as the ones that came with the IPOD. I am returning them."
2,Skip it.,"If you're planning on doing any movement with it, then find another pair of earbuds. I used these at the gym and the left earbud failed within a few months. Then again, at this price I really shouldn't have expected much more than that.That being said, the sound quality actually is decent. And it blocks outside sounds pretty well."
2,"Bass is weak, treble is bright, ""bass booster"" these are not","I've had these for a few hours now. I've played with the equalizer on my laptop, and tried to get a satisfying sound out of them, but I've just not been able to!The bass is weak, and the mids seem to be too loud. The ""bass booster"" appears to be a rubber shroud placed over the speaker element in an attempt to ""drive"" more sound to your ear. It doesn't work all that well; I'd recommend Koss's ""The Plug"" or ""The SparkPlug"" ear phones. They deliver a MUCH more satifying bass, and reproduce a more even sound. I like the Koss models because the ear cushions they provide are for a MUCH more snug fit, and deliver more of the sound directly to your ear.These earphones also provide a very poor isolation from the outside environment (my primary reason for purchasing them). I can't drown out office noise with them.These will be returned immediately."
3,Sony MDR-ED21LP,"This was not what I expected. I was looking for buds that have a ""cone"" shape. At least that is how they looked to me in the picture. But they are round shaped - they just do not fit my ear very well. They certainly increase the bass sound very nicely. They also let in more outside noise then I expected, making it sometimes difficult to hear the music."
2,Good sound but very uncomfortable,"The sound is great (for the price) but it is very uncomfortable ... the fitting is awkward. Also, the cord is too short. I bought them to be used while writing code on a PC; but alas the code is very short: I have put the PC on a prop to use the earphones."
4,Awesome in-ear headphones,"I received these headphones quicker than was originally told. They have incredible sound for headphones so small. Very rich bass and no crackle, even at loud volumes. I am still trying to find a comfortable position for them to sit in my ears. I would strongly recommend these to anyone."
3,"They sound ok, but they have too much bass.","I just got these earbuds and they sound ok. They fit fine in my ears and the sound quality is ok. The problem is that they have too much bass and depending on what you're listening to the bass may be way too much to the point that it will hurt your ears. I have used the Sony MDR-E829V Fontopia Earbuds with In-line Volume Control for years and loved them! I wanted to try something new that's why I got these and I can honestly say that the Sony MDR-E829V Fontopia Earbuds with In-line Volume Control will blow the ED21LP's out of the water hands down. The MDR-E829V are also much cheaper, they are about $6 here at amazon.I don't think I would recommend these earbuds to anyone. I can use these as backup in case something happens to my MDR-E829V's.Don't buy these there is better out there for cheaper."
3,Good value for the price,"These are my first earbuds. The sound is good, but I have a hard time keeping them in my ears. They slip halfway out, and then the sound quality drops off sharply."
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought a set of these to replace my original iPod earphones when they started malfunctioning. On the good side, the sound is decent. On the bad side, these earbuds are very uncomfortable. After more than a week of usage, I still can't find a positioning that will let me wear them for more than an hour without getting seriously annoyed. Also the cord is both short and not as convenient as iPod cords when it comes to folding/unfolding, tangling/untangling.I wish there was a way of testing earbuds before buying them. All I can say is, look at how many people writing these reviews are complaining about the ear fitting issues, and decide for yourself. I did this and bet that I wouldn't have problems, but obviously I lost. Clearly, I'm recommending that you pass, even though the offer is tempting."
3,Ok....I' changed my mind,"Man this earbuds are not all that great,,I mean for the price, they are ok but they sound just slightly better than the head phones that came with my Zen, I was thinking of returning, but since I deceided to purchase a new player after my Zen died,,, I'll update u on weather they have a different effect on a different player.They Rock and they rock hard,,,,,I give this earbuds 5 stars, I was ready to send these babies back where they came from, Im glad I didn't, I quickly unpacked them when my CowonD2 came, plugged them in an I am amazed, I listen to all types of music, r&b;, hip-hop, rock, rap, jazz, gospel, etc.. and they bring so much to your listening experience,, the price is cheaper than when I purchased,,, for the price this phones are a steal, they really should be a lot higher for the sound quality"
4,Nice for the price.,"These earphones appear to be intrusive, but I was surprised at the comfort level. They also stay in the ear nicely without coming out, even while doing things such as working in the yard. Very nice for the price. The sound quality was much better than other headphones of similar price that I have used."
3,pretty decent for the money,"Surprisingly good headphones for almost nothing. I've used and enjoyed the $30-$40 fontopias for years and tried these; not bad. The fact that they don't stay in place in my ears as well the others and I still think they're okay soundwise actually says something. To get an idea of my pickiness level in earbud headphones, I think the stock iPod earbuds are embarassingly bad and completely unusable for music."
2,"ok,but uncomfortable","I purchased the ear buds after reading all the reviews, and thought for the price, it was a good deal. I think the sound is great, but finding a good position in you ear that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable is a challenge.Working out, they do slip out of your ears."
3,junk,"well what can i say....it's a $10 headphones, i didn't expect too much from this. i hoped it would work for at least a year, but nope. it lasted me almost 4 months. the wire on the right side lost connection. the earpiece did fit my ears nicely, but it might be too big for ppl with small ears. the diameter is about 1 cm. so if ur ears ain't that big, don't buy this."
3,"Good overall, but..",These headphones provide better bass than similar models but the highs are lacking what you'd get from more expensive ones. I like the rubber ear casings. The only issue with these is that they have to be positioned perfectly in your ear to get good sound. After listening for longer periods they fall out of place and have to be repositioned. I would recommend these as a replacement for pack-in earbuds. But for the money Koss Ksc-75 are around the same price and sound a lot better than any earbuds I've heard in the price range.
4,Overall good headphones,"Being someone with funny-shaped ears, I have previously found it hard to find earbuds that will fit into my ears. These were the first ones I found that would not fall out. Sound quality was good, and they kept me company through many a train ride, with lots of background noise. My only complaint is that I found that they would not last very long, even though I am very careful with my belongings. The wires would fray and eventually lead to the demise of stereo headphones; only one side worked. They were good enough, however, that I bought another pair before moving on to greener pastures (i.e. the Bose in-ear earbuds -- much more expensive, but worth it, too!)."
4,great product for the price,"Sound great and at a great price, I used them all summer and i sweat alot when I do my cardio outside."
2,Uncomfortable,"I was looking for a non traditional ear bud headphone, and while the style of these headphones fit the bill, I found them to be very uncomfortable after just a short period of time (20-30 min). The sound quality was very good but did not make up for my discomfort. I should note that although I am 5'7"", I have rather small ears."
2,I thought it would be better.,I expected more than a plastic shoe box at this price. Once it wears out (as the directions say it will) I'll use an old shoe box and a phone book like Daisy has suggested for 75 years.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought these to get through a high-grade 1/8"" steel bracket. They barely scratched the surface. I will say that I also bought some Ridgid brand cobalt bits that didn't get the job done either. Surprisingly some cheep B&D; 'Bullet' bits made it through.This set comes in a really nice case and the bits look good too, but are just not going to get through the tough jobs. For basic drilling they are fine and I'm going to keep mine around for easier projects."
3,"Great Price, Medium Quality","These are made in China. I found they did not drill straight for the small od bits. I went with Montana Brand, made in the USA titanium bits which drill true. The case is nice on this product, but I wanted good high quality drills made in Canada or the USA or Germany. I guess I should have known from the price point. That said these make nice back up drills or an project where your likely to drill a lot and throw the drill away when done or not need it much thereafter."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The flap on the inside says things like ""The book will certainly come in handy whenever you're going up against your right-wing adversaries"". My response to that is, how so? Most of the book is just nasty things said by other people. How is that handy? People said nasty things about Jesus Christ and Gandhi!! It also has quotes from Lisa Simpson and Sideshow Bob. Come on, these are cartoon characters!! Of course, it commits the fallacy of appealing to inappropriate authority by quoting celebs like Rosie O'Donnell and Sean Penn. Since when is either one an authority on anything? All this book showed me was how childish the Left can be."
5,Sometimes it's better to laugh than cry.,"I bought this for my sister, who greatly enjoyed it. The quotations are witty and contain more than a grain of truth."
3,Lifts the veil on vaccines,"Don't expect to be entertained by this DVD. It is consists of a videoed lecture given to a live audience by presenter, Sherri Tenpenny, substantially from fixed camera angles and the occasional Powerpoint(tm) screen dub. However, that should not deter anyone wanting to know more about the health risks associated with vaccines and immunization (yes, there is a difference I discovered). This may be the only DVD in general circulation on this important and neglected subject. It is informative, authoritative, and thorough. Parents in particular will derive benefit from the knowledge and arguments presented."
4,Dr. Tenpenny sure makes the case against vaccinations,"At the minimum, you will re-consider your vaccination strategy after having listened to this lecture.When coupled with other resources on the subject, one will eventually cross the psychological chasm and let go of vaccinations as a sustainable disease prevention tool altogether.The lecture is well founded on science and formal CDC publications (I checked the references - they're real).Only challenge is following Tenpenny's fast speaking pace for more than 2 hours lecture, packed with details, at times too technical.Mor"
5,The Best info on Vaccines!,"This is the best info I have seen on Vaccines. I wish that everyone would take the time to watch this video, I wish I had before I vaccinated all of my kids and now I have 2 that are vaccine injured. You can also see Dr Tenpenny speak on vaccines on google video..."
2,A little disappointed,"This media resource was a little dissappointing, since I purchased it with the intent to include it in a health course. It was not a good fit for classroom use. The delivery of the content includes speaking & powerpoint. It may be useful for individual parents looking for a deeper understanding of vaccinations and possible dangers."
3,Video,"I bought this thinking that it was on DVD, but it came in a video. I just checked my history and I did order a DVD. I have contacted the seller and am waiting for a reply."
5,"Dry, informative, with charts, stats, and reasonable conclusions","I thought this DVD would be of the anecdotal kind, telling the story of someone affected by vaccines, or switching from interview to interview. It was nothing like that. The format is that of a lecture with Powerpoint slides given by a credible speaker. Being a data scientist, I was pleased to be shown (finally!) some actual numbers. My wife and I feel empowered after having watched this video."
2,Naaah...,"Me, I don't like it. I don't think the cartoon style fits the Conan canon at all; it should be drawn more realistically. And the Conan character himself doesn't look like the ""usual"" Conan that is now more or less firmly ensconced in the public mind. He looks more like Tarzan than Conan.So yes, I agree, go for the Savage Sword version instead."
5,Great CD,This CD was purchased as a gift. The recipient has repeated thanked me and stated that the CD has been greatly enjoyed. Score!!
4,A wonderful blend of remarkable voices ...,"My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing/listening to Chanticleer at Tanglewood (Lenox, Mass.). A wonderful range of voices and a wonderful range of musical selections.Reminds me of the Yale Whiffenpoofs, with more mature voices.A real treat."
2,Take a class instead,"Pilates is difficult enough to learn through the ""help"" of a book, let alone one that is as wordy and convoluted as this one. If you're looking for a good book that details pilates moves with helpful pictures, diagrams and less superfluous chatter, I suggest ""The Pilates Body"" by Brooke Siler."
1,Buy a different book!!!,"Nothing against Pilates, but this book is horrible! It is poorly written and the instructions do not match the pictures. I'd recommend trying another book instead (any other book)."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been machine knitting for about 18 years and most of the stitches included in this book I learnt to do quite early on. This is probably a book better suited to a beginner who may not have any other source for learning these stitches. I also found the majority of the stitches outdated. They were big in the 1980's when everything was big, bulky and oversized. Only some of the stitches would suit todays fashions. I wouldn't reccomend it but others might like the stitches in this book."
5,Knitter's Bonanza!,"I obtained this book after I had been machine-knitting for about 2-3 years, and have found it an inexhaustible treasure-trove of techniques, tips and patterns. I refer to it over and over. It's worth 10x its price. Whether you are a brand-new machine-knitter, or a seasoned one, this book will never collect dust on your shelf----you might even find yourself needing to buy a new one!"
4,Great Resource- I would love to see an updated version,"This is one of the better machine knitting books out there. Like most on the subject it is very dated, and tough to read, but you will be able to use all the patterns and techniques on newer machines. I use it with a Silver Reed 150 and its a great resource."
5,Heads Up,"The ""Track Listings"" on the Amazon product page are incomplete. What this disc DOES have are the 15 tracks listed on the product page as ""On this CD.""And, yea, this disc sounds magnificent."
1,save your money,"I agree with the reviewers that say this DVD is not that great. Cohen is a very stiff player and the things he shows you would only impress beginners who had no knowledge of chords.He also assumes you know music theory , which many do not. If you play worst that Cohen, this DVD will not help you. Most players are much better than he is and have more feeling in their playing. Not to mention his predictable solos.One star because he does explain the drawbars , but he doesn't show how to use them in performance. I've learned more watching real Hammond players, who would probably make a better video. Cohen is probably not a real Hammond player. This video will not make you one either. Save your money."
1,Jumpy,"Cohn jumps over the place. He starts you out on one topic, jumps to another topic, says that he will talk more about the subject later, then trys to jump back into what he was talking about in the first place. I watched it several times through. I was so confused by his method that I trashed the DVD."
2,Not Worth The Money--A Disappointment,"What can I add, most of the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. This man does not come accross as a real player's player. He does not show or share great chops, or teach great licks and answer long asked questions. I imagine a beginner would find a lot to learn here."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I had heard some of this artist's music on DirecTV's new age radio station. Based on that, I ordered this CD - in its entirety it is not as enjoyable as the single tracks were."
5,A completely original thinker,"This was Watts' last book and the one many consider his finest. Written beautifully and eloquently, it is a work of both scholarship and poetry. The depth of clarity in spiritual wisdom is remarkable."
5,Excellent Used Product,I'd paid new price for this before but couldn't afford to buy another new one after I'd misplaced the book and wanted another one to read and study. I purchased the lowest used price one there was and got a same as new product. I'll buy used from now on.
2,I didn't want to learn the language.,"Didn't like this book-- honestly i prefer to hear alan lecture, so far none of his books have had the impact that him speaking has for me."
5,THE BEST & MY FAV,"I've had several different kinds of chocolate and have had the pleasure of trying several kinds of Leonidas products offered. This one happens to be my favorite for many different reasons. I like it's soft, smooth, melt in your mouth with a hint of almond and hazelnut flavor. It's pure heaven. They are very rich and I can't have more than one or two a day, but it's awesome.If you've never tried Leonidas Chocolates or have always thought other chocolates were just as good (Godiva, etc...) then I highly recommend Leonidas Assortment Product (see link below) to try the various styles and chocolates offered.I promise you wont' be sorry and you'll love the service of this company as well!!!Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment"
5,Yummy Yummy!!!,There are no words to describe these pralines except delicious. I love to order a ballotin once a year and indulge for few weeks on the chocolates. Must try!
4,Great Over all Book,I loved the pictures and I loved the training help in this book! Though like all horse books I disagreed with some aspects of the book but I am horse person and you know we are all so opionionated. But I would reccommend it to anyone training thier 1st horse!!!
2,Far from expectations,"This book was terrible. It provided no helpful information whatsoever. It was lacking in even the most basic ridership information that everyone knows. Also the pictures were vague and hard to follow. It seems to be written for a two year old, using no words longer than three letters except for ""horsies"" instead of ""horses"". Overall I'd say don't buy this book unless you want to throw your money away."
1,Not worth a penny,"This book is terrible. Not only does the author try and steal ideas from other authors, he doesn't even do a good job of it. There are sections in the book where paragraphs end in the middle of a sentence and never seem to finish anywhere. I do not recommend this book."
4,Another fun outing for Mrs. Pollifax,"(Based on the audiotape, no longer available (?) )Mrs. Pollifax is called upon by the CIA to undertake another mission, this time to photograph members of a safari, one of whom is an international assassin, nicknamed Aristotle. She innocently posts an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact her old friend Farrell from the first book. This leads to major complications as Farrell is involved with the freedom fighters across the border and has made some enemies. Another entertaining outing and with a bit of romance as a fellow traveler takes a fancy to Mrs. Pollifax. Barbara Rosenblat does another excellent job reading, coming up with clear, distinct, and identifiable voices for a myriad of characters."
4,Hunting an assassin,"Whenever Mr. Carstairs of the CIA needs an innocent tourist, his first thought is of Emily Pollifax, New Brunswick, NJ. Now he has information that an international assassin-for-hire is going to be part of a guided safari in Zaire, and he wants photographs of all the participants to share with Interpol in hopes that they can put a face to his code name. So off goes Mrs. Pollifax to the not-so-dark continent. But as always, her mission acquires unexpected complications--Cyrus Reed, a retired judge who shows more than a mild interest in her; his grown daughter, who seems attracted to two of the young men in the group; and Mrs. P's newspaper ad for her old Albanian prisonmate, John Sebastian Farrell, which attracts first a police inquiry and then a sinister trio of kidnappers. Mrs. Pollifax's delight in her first visit to Africa is especially well portrayed (""She would *demand* lions""), and she's lost none of her quick wits and courage. An excellent entry to the series."
2,OK if you don't know Africa,As a yarn goes this novel is tolerable but I write this review as a warning to anyone who has actually spent time in Africa - this book will irritate you.The characters are all lazy stereotypes which is tolerable until we come across 'freedom' fighters being portrayed as such.Having had family in that part of the world it is just too much to read about them as they are portrayed here. These 'freedom fighters' were terrorists and yet they were the darlings of the bleeding hearts. It is nauseating to read this novel when you know that the author had the opportunity to do a bit of research but chose to reinforce the fluffy stereotypes instead.Am I wrong? See how things have turned out in Zimbabwe.
3,oatmeal,The oatmeal is kind of bland and there are only 2-3 tiny pieces of nuts per serving. It was filling and OK
4,The only blueprint?,"Dr. Derrick has written a quite wonderful book. I wish we had more scholars like him, and more philosophers to think and write about the liberal arts. And one cannot but be impressed by that college in Ojai, although it appears to be a response to the spiritual upheaval caused by Vatican II without the critical distance toward that disastrous event. In the true liberal tradition Dr. Derrick should have dug deeper.And the author fails to tell us anywhere why a recrudescence of the liberal arts must be Catholic, rather than catholic. Many are happy that Dr. Derrick's college is pointing the way, but a true and lasting revalorization of the arts in the 21st century, while taking into account religious truth, must be outside the gust of denominationalism."
5,Simply put -- well worth reading!!!,"If you any interest in Atlanta history, including Coca-Cola history, then this book is a must read at only 250 pages. The writing style makes the reading very enjoyable. The author previously wrote ""Secret Formula"", a history of Coca-Cola."
4,re: reader from florida,"The reader from Florida exemplifies why schools are failing black students. He/she is a teacher who does not believe in minority students' abilities. Evidently, this is not a wise teacher; this is one who has adopted the racist dogma of Murray, Levine and others. (Dogma that can not be scientifically proven. this teacher would be surprised to know that tests show that black babies & toddlers are more advanced than white babies and toddlers.) This person should not be allowed to teach in schools where he does not believe in the students' abilities.Black students quickly sense and tune-in to racism--they know when someone is being condescending or does not respect"
5,No excuse for not answering the culture question?,"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down as it put in print what all good teachers know. We can't make all kids do their homework, come to school, behave in an acceptable manner, get parents to care, charter schools are great because they are selective...In other words, we can't change the culture. I continued to read for the real solution to the achievement gap--culture. I also was hopeful another wasteful, ineffective program like Title I and Headstart, IDEA, would be discussed. Understandably, I was disappointed when I finished the book and never learned the Thernstroms' solutions to the culture problem. Once again, the achievement gap has been discussed; we all know what causes it, but no one has a solution. Maybe there isn't one."
4,On Point,Very concise and informative resource.I am glad I purchased this book. I suggest it for anyone investigating the racial gap.
4,Bad news and lobbying for charter schools,"Get ready for some really bad news if you are a liberal. The authors go to great lengths to outline the academic gap between white versus black and hispanic students. The authors analyze all the excuses for poor performance and come up with the No Excuses truth. Its the cutltures of those ethnic groups.However, their answer is charter schools and not parental accountability. With the exception of some anecdotal evidence there is nothing to support this conclusion."
4,The Designer Wedding!,"I found the Designer Bride planning binder and software to be a ""must"" in the planning of my wedding. Every detail, there was nothing left to chance. It provided an oustanding guide for the elegant wedding that I had always dreamed of.The software is very easy to use and works very well with the planning binder. It allowed me to stay very organized and able to enjoy all of the events leading up to my wedding day. I recommend Ms.Berte's Designer Bride to all of my friends that are getting married."
5,A must have for all brides to be!,Fabulous! The software is easy to use with the planning binder. I kept me organized and not too stressed out for our big day.
4,Packaging is the added value for this poster.,"I bought this poster with some other ones, and this was the only one that arrived in perfect shape, it came in an hard plastic folder, that kept it intact, the other ones, from other sellers came with wrinkles and some scratches.The print quality is ok, but not the best, it is digital not offset, but for the price this is more than what you can expect. I put it in a frame, and looks so good."
3,Unorthodox,"The book is written for an esoteric group and is not readable for many. Milbank does a good job presenting his complex philosophy on the work of Christ. However, his view is essentially that evil has no ontological substance. Therefore, Christ did not die to take on sin or do away with evil, but rather to identify with us as homo sacer, or an outcast. Essentially, his take is the unorthodox (at least for Western churches) position that the cross is much more about moral example and mystical identification than substitution, penal satisfaction or cleansing."
2,This book is obviously mis-titled!Not amazing nor amusing.,"This book is full of the kinds of tricks we did as kids (i.e. - stick our finger through the bottom of a large match box, stuff cotton around our finger, squirt some ketchup around it, and tell our friends it's a ""finger from an ancient mummy""). The calibur of these tricks is meant for kids ages 4-8 (if you dare putting your children at risk of being ridiculed by their peers for performing these LAME tricks). I do not recommend this book for ADULTS. I only recommend this to children as reading material only, not performing."
1,Shaver does not work,I don't have a particularly tough beard and I have used other electric shavers. This one reminds me of the product when electric shavers first came out: marginally effective even after spending 3X longer than shaving with a blade. Don't be fooled by the price - it doesn't work
1,Great Razor if it could last a trip in the plane,"I actually loved this razor. It was cheap; it was easy to use, and it did what it was supposed to rather well. Other than having to get used to an electric razor after only using the Gillete brand of razors, this razor was great.But then one little trip back home to California on a plane and the razor couldn't handle being the trip. When I opened up my bag to grab and shave, the head had fallen off and when reattached, it simply would not stay attached.The point of this review? If you plan on taking trips often, don't buy this razor, otherwise I'd actually recommend it."
2,Shaver Fine - Attached Trimmer Worthless,"If you want a shaver this one works well. I feel the ""pivot"" portion is a marketing ploy versus actually helping with the shave. However I purchase a shaver for both the shaving portion and the attached trimmer (not the ear/nose trimmer). I have a mustache. I don't need much, just something that can occasionally trim that mustache. The trimmer is a total letdown. Maybe they forgot to sharpen mine but it is truly worthless. Now I need to purchase a mustache trimmer or a new shaver. I do like Panasonic shavers. And, again, if you just need a shaver this one does a good job. The nose/ear hair trimmer is also solid. It's just not large enough to do a mustache."
3,Not for international use,"When I purchased the shaver, I was under the impression that it would work on US or European voltages. I was wrong! I thought all of the ""wall warts"" would work on any of the international voltages, but I guess you found one that wouldn't. That's a shame since I intended to travel to Budapest with it. I guess I will have to find another. I do not like using the voltage converters-they take up too much space when packing."
2,Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver,"Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference."
5,so good...,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
5,LOVE IT!,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
5,Great Pastry!,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"". She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school. I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush. These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
3,Better option than the name brand,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories. A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
5,Yummy!,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
5,Still buying these...years later...,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.~The Rebecca Review
5,Who knew organic tasted so good?,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
4,"Great alternative to ""PopTarts"", but add more filling!","These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
3,better than the non-frosted,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted. Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
2,"Well, it's a toaster pastry, what can you say?","I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either). For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle. However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again. They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside. The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"". Just not really worth eating, in my opinion. A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
1,Not Whole Grain...!,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Invert, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Whole Wheat Flour"
3,very sweet & 5 grams of fat per pastry,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
5,loved by kids and husbands alike,"These are great! Excellent alternative to p**t****. All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up. Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
5,Better alternative to pop tarts,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the high fructose corn syrup, I say no. I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts. The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
3,"Tastes good, and organic but refined sugar and flour.","Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour. That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature. Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.They taste very good, like a dessert. It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth. It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
2,Lots of Sugar!,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about the Teldec Recording of Faure's ""Requiem"". I like the interpretation, especially the ""Sanctus"", ""In paradisum"" and most of all Bonney's sensitive, beautifully shaped and controlled ""Pie Jesu"". Bonney's rendition contrasts with Battle's ""Pie Jesu"" in Giulini's interpretion of the ""Requiem"":I dislike the excessive tremulo in Battle's version. However, I was disappointed with the sound quality of the Teldec pressing when the volume swelled; it sounded like a worn vinyl record. So, there was much to enjoy; but some disappointment."
3,Seriously Lacking,"Whether it's choirs that don't know how to blend, an orchestra that doesn't know how to stay together, or any combination of choirs and instrumentalists that don't know how to play in tune, the Duruflé in its full orchestral version does not yet appear to have received the treatment it so desperately needs. I am sure the Fauré has been done better, though. Someday someone is going to do justice to the Duruflé, and give it the interpretation it deserves."
2,Cute -- but not a great resolution!,"I loved the poster online, but when I got it in the mail, it was so pixely. I felt like someone went to Kinkos and just blew up a postcard. Not impressed for the price I paid."
4,Beautiful recording,"I am so sorry that I discovered this work by Mozart until recently. I have been captivated by his operatic work, and just started listening to La Clemenza di Tito about a month ago. It's definately a masterpiece, and this recording shows it. If you'd like to have an introduction to this last of Mozart's operas, choose this recording, it has beautiful sound quality and voices. Grabawski and the chorus are amazing."
4,good dramatic performance,"this is a good recording of lcot that emphasizes the dramatic potential of the work. the singing and acting are well matched by harnoncourt's driven conducting. the only problem are the women's voices are not easily differentiated. there are four girls in principal roles, two sopranos and two mezzos, but they all have very similar timbres and it's not easy to tell who is who w/o following along with the libretto.not a bad performance, otherwise, though personally, while i prefer the more courtly and elegant approach of hogwood on his recording (with bartoli, jones, bonney et al). with hogwood one can see why lcot is considered by some mozart's 'most perfect opera', a 'beautiful work of art'."
4,Hidden Gem,"This is a brilliant little game. Although little-known, any gamer who likes good story and imaginative world-design should pick this up. I love it, my daughter loves it - you will too..."
4,Very fun game,"This is a very fun game:) You can control both Sphynx and the Mummy. U use the mummy if you want to rely on stealth and puzzle solving.So whats the point in Sphynx???!!! I don't knowPros1No delays when making the game, (thank God)2Long levels and pretty hard gameplay make it so that you are for once not wasting your money.3Good story4Lots of different moves, and puzzles and monsters so you don't get tired of the same moves, monsters,(etc)5EXTREMELY FUN GAMECons1No dialogue2You cant save your game unless you approach a saving statue (sometimes their isn't a saving statue for the entirety of the level:(3If you want to start the game over, you cant skip all the dialogue and talkingOverall, a fun game."
1,This game sucks!!!,I thought this game would be good when my friend showed it to me but i was wrong! This game is supposed to be violent but most of the game is trying to figure out where to go.Everyone says that this game is really good but believe me it stinks.
5,Great Resource,"I've been waiting to purchase this book for quite a while...... and it was worth the wait.It's packed with numerous projects, detailed instructions, and clear illustrations to help you visualize the process.A timeless resource for all clothing enthusiasts."
5,Draping book,"Awesome book, was a gift for my daughter who is going to school for fashion design. She loved it. Brand new book for a great price."
4,Draping for Apparel Design,I bought this book because my college course told me so. I would like to say that you can probably save money by just buying the other draping book. i forgot the name of it but it's just simple draping 1 book that has purple and green on the cover page. this book is a great book if you do not know the basic of draping. Or if you are not creative enough to create your own design without a step by step manual for how it is done. All in all it's a great book. I bought it for 80 dollars and used it quite a few times just to create outfits for myself.
4,Draping for Apparel Design,"Excellent book about drapping and worth to buy especially for the beginner who learn how to modify your basic pattern, it would be better if in the next edition shown how to modify the pattern more specifically, with measurement sample."
1,More grist for the propaganda mill,"The reviewer below is too generous in allocating his stars, but I essentially agree with the views presented. Dragnich is otherwise a quite effective propagandist for the Serb nationalist cause, at least in America, since he has the veneer of academic legitimacy. This book is essentially an appendix to his earlier epic of pro-Serbian historiography called ""Serbs and Croats."" Read this only if you're doing an analysis of propaganda in the recent Balkan wars. The only thing I can't believe is that this was published as a part of the ""East European Monographs,"" otherwise a series of fine scholarly works, which this book definitely is not."
2,Sophisticated defense of Genocide,"The author provides a slick, articulate defense for the actions of his thuggish kinsmen extending the boundaries of ""Greater Serbia"" (Milosevic, Karadavic, Mladic). Revolutions may be won by illiterate, gun-toting gangsters, but in order to justify their existence they inevitably turn to members of the ""intelligentsia"". The author performs an admirable job of providing just enough pontificating to appear unbiased, while eagerly embracing the antics of a group of wannabe Storm Troopers. Give this material an ""I"" for idiotic."
3,The Gun that won the West,This movie is another look at the first clash between the US Army and the Indians in the Post Civil War Period. Richard Denning and Dennis Morgan are the Leads. Why it plays with the truth it is a film to enjoy on a day when there is nothing to watch.
3,= * * *,"I infer from the title that this book is not primarily for end users or DBAs, but instead for developers who want to interact with PostgreSQL as part of a larger application context. I do not see any other books in mid 2002 which seem to have the same target.I would say this book goes into a little more depth for the application developer than the other notable PostgreSQL books I have seen (Practical pgsql, pgsql Essential Reference, Beginning Databases with pgsql), but not much, and the more useful information is mixed with a lot of less useful information.I do not think this book is a waste of money, but it is definitely not a must have."
3,"Touched too many things, but not very deep on anything","This book touched too many things but with very shallow coverage on each subjest. It looks a direct copy from the online documentation. It is a pure waste of trees. In certain places, the author missed very important things. For example, the ExecCommandOk command is totally missed from this book.As an reference book this book is too shallow. As an tutorial it is not good enough."
3,Nothing spectacular,"I am really, really trying to like this book, but on the issues which are most important to me, it has let me down. If you are new to PostGreSQL, this book will suit you fine. However, the book doesn't give you any information that the documentation does not. In fact, it sometimes gives you less information. For example, when writing functions in C, the book fails to mention VarChar* as a data type. Additionally, the book states that compiling and linking require special flags, and that your compiler docs will provide this information. In contrast, the online docs explicitly give you the flags for BSD, Free/Net/OpenBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, Solaris, Tru64, and UnixWare.If you want to learn PostGreSQL, this is a suitable book. However, if you want to explore the more advanced features of PostGreSQL, this book is not for you."
2,Code glitch,"I am fairly new to PostgreSQL although i have nearly 6 years of solid database experience. I brought a brand new copy of this book, so i could quickly pick up the essentials of postgresql without having to read through a lot of fluff.Unfortunately most of the code of the code samples that i have tried testing has given me erroneous messages.I have tried contacting the support team for this book and am yet to get a response.To me as a reader the purpose of buying this book is defeated.I wouldn't recommend this to any serious PostgreSQL developer:("
1,the cover is fine - the pool is horrible,"The entire pool was horrible. The cover was fine once we got it on, but we finally got rid of the pool after 2 weeks because it was so hard to set up and keep clean."
1,Solar Pool Cover,"This is not a toy. It is a pool cover. It is not real durable, but will last for the summer."
3,The 22-20s garage rock blues,"Interesting how the 22-20s are from the UK considering that their sound is right out of the 70's deep south. Just think The White Stripes meets the The Kings Of Leon with a touch of the MC5. Most of 05-03 swaggers at a frenetic pace, almost like a country-tinged Jet, intertwined with some mellow blues songs. Another description would be Black Rebel Motorcycle Club meets Lynyrd Skynyrd. There's really no other way to describe this CD other than is southern fried garage-rock, down and dirty, energetic and brash, making for a foot stomping good time."
4,Potential,"Oh these crazy English blues boys have got the 'tude alright, but have they got the songs? The answer is mostly yes, even if they manage the feat of being more derivative than Jet. This live record is mostly decent to good blues-punk but it's debut single ""Such a Fool"" which casts an overwhelming shadow of brilliance over everything else. No doubt about it - on the strength of that song, it's clear that these guys have potential."
5,Great alternative rock,"the guys from 22-20s have produced a short but good album and relly displays their talents, they're amazing live too."
1,I Received Two Copies Of This Video And Both Were Blank,"I had planned to buy the entire ""Missions OfCalifornia"" series but after receiving two copiesof this video and one copy of another video in thesame series that were completely blank I returned allthree videos and decided not to order any more.$... is too much to pay for a video that is only10-15 minutes long. If someone is interested in theCalifornia Missions I recommend that they order ""TheMissions Of California"" tape for $... It has thesame information as the ""California Mission"" series andincludes Mission San Antonio De Padua that the ""CaliforniaMission"" series omits."
1,Should have purchased the brand name....,Back in February my laptop battery offically died and I bit the bullet to get a new one. I got this one and about two months ago I noticed that my charge was fading. Well now a full 100% charged battery lasts me all of 3 minutes before it dies.
3,Accurate but not for motorcycles,"Okay, this gauge is accurate. Bravo. Now, if you have a motorcycle, prepare to have a fun time trying to find a good position to check your air pressure. It's too bulky for a motorcycle tire. On my FZ6, the gauge keeps getting held up at the rotors or brakes and sometimes the wheel gets in the way. Also by the time you have a good seal between the gauge and the tire, the tire has already lost a hefty portion of air. As much as 10 psi have been lost trying to fit this gauge onto the valve stem. So, don't check your tires if you are away from a pump.Other than that, it does it's job. When you get it to do it."
2,"Batteries died, then wouldn't work properly after replacing.","While it worked, it was great. Then, the batteries died, which is expected. But after replacing the batteries (3) the unit no longer works. The display lights, but it will not take a pressure."
2,"Works good while it lasts, but that isn't long.","The gauge works very well for a couple years, then you replace the batteries, then it doesn't work anymore. It just gives you a -0.0 reading followed by ""E."" Batteries are exactly the right number and installed right, but it's done. Can't recommend."
2,It's to big,"I brought this thinking it would be easy to read, but in the daylight it isn't so easy. It works fine for a car or truck tire, but it's TOO BIG for a motorcycle. I can't squeeze it in to take a reading of a motorcycle back tire. It was cheap so I threw in the trash and got a different one down at the local auto parts store."
1,also dissappoited with age usage,My gauge was great also in the beginning. Slowly after 10 or 20 uses it began to be more difficult to get a reading. Now it is nothing more than a paper weight.
3,"Quick reading, awkward shape","This thing works fast. Way easier than the old tire gauges I've been using all my life. The rubber handle is pretty nice. It's also lightweight.On the con side, it could have been made a bit smaller. It's a little awkward, and although it works well for cars, it does not for bicycles as I have to weave it into the spokes just so. Even then, it's difficult to keep it from releasing a lot of air from the tire in an attempt to get a reading."
4,Is it not accurate only for mine?,"It is not accurate at first time. The other gauges show around 34 or 35 psi whereas this show 39 psi. I tried to calibrate several times according to manual, but it doesn't help to fix issue. I put it in to the trunk and I had not used for several month. Recently I try to use it, It works fine now. I don't know why it works now. Anyway it is fine for now"
4,"works, but hard to fit on moto wheels","The gauge seems to work. I have no idea how accurate it is, but a motorcycle magazine rated it among the best in a test of scores of digital and mechanical gauges.It's fairly flat, so you can throw it in your pocket without it bulging too much.The downside is that it can be difficult to fit on the valve. Mine leaks a little each time I push it on, especially in the rear where the drum interferes. If you have double disks in front you would need an angled valve stem to use this.This is another great gift item. Sometimes these particular gauges are crazy cheap, and everyone needs a good gauge."
2,Bothersome to use,"For someone who just wants a quick pressure readout, without having to mess around to make sure the gauge is inserted correctly, this tool is not that easy to use. It's much easier to get an air pump nozzle over the tire nipple then to get this over the same nipple. At times I've had the gauge show me 29, then a few seconds later when I tried again, it showed 31. I assume I wasn't using it correctly. There must be easier gauges out there for people like me."
5,Great Tool For Fair Price,I based my purchase on a favorable review in Consumers Report. I also been very satisfied with it`s accuracy and consistant readings. Far easier to use than a pen style tire gauge.
3,Accurate but NOT Durable.,"It worked great while it lasted. Unfortunately, the pin inside of it that pushes on the tire valve is PLASTIC!! Needless to say, the plastic wears over time. This past weekend, I accidentally inserted the tire pressure gauge at an angle and the plastic inside that pushes the tire valve pin, broke off and now it does not work. I'm a techie, but there's no need to spend extra money on a digital tire gauge when the analog ones at your local auto parts store are just as accurate, cheaper, and more durable."
2,"Pros: Cheap, Digital. Cons: Mediocre accuracy, 0.5 psi precision","This digital tire pressure gauge measures pressure in 0.5 psi increments (e.g. 29.5 psi, 30.0 psi, 30.5 psi, but nothing in between). It terms of accuracy, this gauge has always been within 1.0 psi of the actual tire pressure. However, if you use this gauge to take two measurements of the same tire right after each other (i.e., no change in pressure due to temperature or other factors), the readings can be up to 1.0 psi above or below the first reading.However, if you don't have a tire pressure monitoring system in your car, this is a reasonable gauge for a reasonable price that is far better than the old fashioned metal analog variety."
1,Did not work.,The item looked promising until i put it to test my Elantra's tire pressure. It had only one pressure to display! I checked and there were no sticker or wrapper on the LCD! Had to return it.
5,Excellent purchase...,This Digital Tire Gauge is an excellent bargain. It's completely 100% calibrated out of the box and has stayed that way. I highly recommend it!
2,short battery life,"Just be aware that you will need to replace the batteries in this air gauge. I've had this gauge for 18 months and it worked fine the first two times I used it. The third time I tried to use it the batteries we dead. $15.00 to replace them. I threw the unit away and purchased an analog device. If you're willing to be without it when you need it and willing to pay through the nose for batteries, this unit will be fine for you."
2,Leaking air,"The accuracy seems okay but the air leakage has become a real pain to me since I recently switched from solid tires to normal ones for my toy at home and am trying to figure out a best performance air pressure for the normal tires since the company provides info only for the RFTs. I purchased this guage to avoid the air leakage that goes undetected when checking tire pressure or just when riding . Sorry to say, I am very disappointed. My cheap analog guage is doing the same job except that fancy display."
4,Good for money,"This is very lite in weight and handy to fit in your pocket. I have onlcy one concern about batteries, I don't know form where I'll get them and what type of bettery its required."
5,Accutire MS-4021B Standard Digital Tire Gauge,Great. Works easily and FAST!! You actually don't have to put more quarters in because it's so fast you finish on time.
2,Not too good,"Its hard to get a good seal because its hard plastic and has no gasket. it works, but i lose a little bit of air compared with another one that my mother bought years ago which has a rubber gasket. i don tknow where she got it from though, maybe id go to wlmart to find one."
2,Please ignore the 5-star reviews... this gauge eats batteries @ $5-a-pop,"Save your money for a better gauge - there's a reason this flawed gauge is so cheap. The tire gauge works fine, but it eats batteries. I purchased the unit 6 months ago, have used it 4 or 5 times, and when I went to use it this morning, it briefly flashed 'LL' on the display and then went dead - it needed new batteries. The unit requires 3 watch batteries, which would cost $5+ to replace, almost as much as the initial price of the unit. I'm just going to toss this unit, rather than sweat replacing watch batteries every 6 months.The 5-star reviewers on this page clearly were a bit hasty in giving their reviews - especially the gentleman who was patting himself on the back for having figured out that he needed to remove the protective sticker from the display."
1,Not solid - the plastic part comes apart,"Even though the handle is quite solid, the silver portion where the LCD display is housed, is made of two pieces of plastic and is not secured together properly , hence when I press the guage on to the valve this portion splits apart due to the pressure and I am unable to get a good seal.Useless now :("
4,Accutire MS-4021B Standard Digital Tire Gauge,"I read about this tire gauge in Consumer Reports Magazine. Having had really bad luck with the non-digital gauges I had purchased at auto supply stores I was anxious to try out the digital unit. I am quite pleased with the device, so pleased I bought one for my son as well. Until tire pressure is completely monitored by the automobile computer system, the Accutire MS-4021B Tire Gauge will do just fine!"
4,handy gadget works well,"This item does exactly what it is supposed to. Easy to use, and gives accurate readings. I intentionally keep one of my tires a little over inflated because it has a slow valve leak, and this device detected it, so I am sold. Bought one for my son too."
5,Best purchase I have made since my G3500!,This is the best purchase I have made here since myNOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5A Automatic Multi-Purpose Battery Charger and Maintainer (Grey). You need to keep up on tire pressure for cars that sit.
4,Sturdy and accurate,"I purchased my second of these digital tire gauges - my other one is 6 years old but my son needs one. Well made and quite consistent, battery replacement is cheap and easy (when you buy your replacement batteries online from China). Readability is OK to Good."
5,The best tire gauge I've owned,"For me, tire gauges never seem to get used under ideal circumstances. Usually I end up needing them on a dark windy night in the middle of nowhere, or worse, on the outskirts of nowhere. So I had a slow leak and needed to make sure the tire was reinflated properly. This device worked flawlessly, with a clear digital readout. Well worth the price."
5,The best tire gauge!,"I am very pleased with this tire gauge. It is so much better than the older type slide-out gauges. Accuracy is excellent, and it is very easy to use. Not sure about battery life yet."
5,I was leery..,"I received this gauge as a stocking stuffer and I was very leery at first. It seemed kinda junky. But going on 11 months now, this gauge has not failed me once. I've tested it alongside a manual gauge, and it is dead on. It's now survived a Minnesota Winter and one half in my glove box.The key to an accurate reading is making sure you get a tight seal when you test your tire."
2,It leaks air !!,"I purchased this guage for only one reason - to avoid the air leakage when checking tire pressure. Sorry to say, I am very disappointed by the top reviewer here mentioning there is no air leakage! FYI - The air does leak! My $2 analog guage is doing the same job except that fancy LED display.The air leakage has become a nuisance to me since I recently switched from Runflat tires (RFT)to normal ones for my BMW and am trying to figure out a best performance air pressure for the normal tires since the company provides info only for the RFTs."
1,Incapable of making necessary seal with tire stem/valve.,I found it almost impossible to get a reading because this gadget would not fit tightly on the valve stem. No other tire gauge I tried afterwards had this problem. I notice several other reviewers had the same experience
3,Uses lots of batteries.,"While this product works fine, and is accurate, it uses (3) A76 watch batteries. That's a lot of batteries. and the batteries generally only last about 6 months. I have to pay $2 ea for the batteries. Total $6 each time. That's $12 a year. and the unit only cost $8.Maybe a unit that uses lithium or other long-lasting batteries would be better.Next time, i think i will try one of the better, more-expensive units."
1,Accurate but not durable,"I found the tire gauge readings to be accurate, and initially this meter was easy to use and quick to take a measurement.However, within 5 months, the plastic part of the gauge that you put onto your tire had deformed to the point that it would no longer take a reading from a tire. I do not work at a mechanical shop, and I have one car and I had taken a reading about once a week for 4-5 months.I would not recommend this product."
2,"Reliable and accurate, but with one fatal flaw","I've owned two versions of this gauge: An LCD version that I bought 7 or 8 years ago, and the more recent LED type. Aside from the display technology, they looked identical.They were both accurate and reliable, but they both also had very poor sealing against the tire valve. The rubber ring that seals against the valve is too hard and uneven. You have to line the gauge up very precisely, and press very hard to avoid a burst of air escaping from the tire. If you don't get a good seal, the reading can be off, and a couple of bursts of air is enough to drop a tire by 1 psi. Every time I checked my tires, this happened on at least one or two of them. It's bad enough that I got into the habit of overfilling the tires by a couple of psi so that when this happened I would not end up below the desired pressure.I finally got tired of it and bought a $26.00 gauge at Sears that seems to be just as accurate and does not have this problem."
4,"If you work it right, it's great","I purchased this gauge for a bike tire that needs 55 psi, and I thought this would work well because it is digital and has a relatively high psi limit. Turns out that it only works if you get the gauge at just the right angle. Any deviation from this angle and you lose ~10-15 psi per attempt at measuring pressure. This can be frustrating if you are using a hand pump to fill up your tires and must repeatedly replace the lost pressure by pumping again. I have not had any problems measuring the pressure of my car tires, however, which salvages a 4th star for this gauge, rather than 3. Though I think my true rating for this gauge is 3.5 stars..."
3,Not so good as the MS-46B / no es tan bueno como el MS-46B,"I own both of them, and i recommend the MS-46B. Not that big, not that impressive but it's better. It's more precise, always give the right reading and doesn't use batteries. With the MS-4021B you get different reading the first 2 or 3 times, and the one decimal 1/2 lb. doesn't really help.---Yo los tengo los dos y recomiendo el MS-46B. No es tan grande ni tan llamativo pero es mejor. Es mas preciso, siempre da la lectura correcta y no usa baterias. Con el MS-4021B uno obtiene diferentes lecturas las primeras 2 o 3 veces, y el decimal que da 1/2 libra de precisión realmente no ayuda."
4,Very simple to use and accurate,"Bought this to keep in the garage for bicycles, cars, and other pneumatic tires in the garage. It sure beats the standard tire gaugees, especially when reading low air pressures (I have a pair of devices that want 16 lbs of pressure in the tires). I've compared it to all my other air gauges and it's neveer been off. I took off one star for the reset process which I find annoying but is rarely required."
1,Amazon shipped the older model?,"The one Amazon shipped does not look like the picture, it's the long thin one with tiny red LED. Got it reshipped and still the same tiny red LED one and not the one in the picture."
2,Nice gauge...but didn't work long,"I bought one, and used it twice over the course of about a month. Seemed to work just fine, and was easy to use and accurage (the first time I checked it against another gauge). The third time I went to use it, it was dead...with no way to replace the battery."
2,Disappointing Experience,"I'm happy for all the people who have had a good experience with this tire gauge, however I didn't. It seemed at first glance to be great. It was easy to use and read and I thought that it was perfect. A few months later I brought it out to use it for only the second time and it had died. I guess those watch batteries don't last even six months. Reading other reviews I note that one must either remove them after every use or replace them every few months or so. I don't have a screwdriver that fits the tiny screw in the handle, so in order to use this product I would have to buy more batteries and a tiny screwdriver, which certainly increases my cost over the original purchase price. I don't think so."
4,Great Gadget,"I typically have used the cheap metal Gauges to test for air pressure, the ones that leak as much air out as possible. This gauge was a different story, it locks into the value and within a half second throws out a fairly accurate PSI reading. I keep this in my jacket pocket and measure before most rides, its a great little tool. The build quality could be better but for the price I recommend it."
4,Great little product,"I have had my trusty 20 year old tire pressure gauge, and it was time to retire. I first saw this product in Consumer Reports. I saved the article but did not track down this gauge because my old one was still working. Finally after dropping my old tire pressure gauge and breaking off cover, I found the article and ordered the Accutire. This is a simple unit to use. I only wish it had a bleeder valve like my old one to properly bleed pressure to get the exact pressure I want.When I try to bleed a little pressure with the Accutire, this causes the unit totry to re-calibrate to zero, which is a little annoying. So I have to let the unit fall asleep, then wake up the unit and then check the tire pressure. Other than that, this unit is very affordable and useful."
2,Dead battery - poor quality,"We bought this brand of tire pressure guage because I've used another one of theirs previously and was very pleased with it.We did not use this right away during the holidays, but last week when i used it for the first time, it worked once (for 1 tire), then died!I'm assuming it is a dead battery. I opened it to find 3 button cells, each of which probably costs $1.50 if I can easily find it!This is unacceptable for any product."
3,Fine while it worked!,This tire pressure monitor was accurate and worked fine for about 2 years. Then the plastic at point of connection on this monitor to the tire stem broke. So now its very hard to use it.
4,It's alright.,"After getting the gauge and tearing off the 28.5 sticker, I tried to measure my tire pressure, but it kept say 188.88 and sounded like air was leaking out when I pressed on the valve.It takes a little while getting used to it. I found it best when I put my thumb right behind the nossle area, when you look at it from the front, to the right of the ACCUTIRE logo. This way I press on the valve straig on instead of lopsided.I had a gift certificate left of $7 so I used it to get this, I'm not sure if I would pay ~$13/shipped for this item."
2,Not Recommended,"I purchased this tire gauge becuase I wanted a digital display gauge that provides1 psi resolution. While the Accutire MS-4021B generally does the job, there are twoannoying features that should be changed :1. Batteries cannot be replaced by the user2. On some valve stems, the Accutire MS-4021B does not make a seal to get an accurate readingRef. #1 : you have to send the gage in to the manufacturer who will replace the batteries free of charge. However, their turnaround time is more than two weeks, and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore, the batteries do not last more than a year or so, but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehiclesRef. #2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design, i.e. the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries"
5,Easy to use,"What can I say, easy to use and accurate to a half pound. Love it love it love it love it."
5,Excellent and accurate,"Very pleased that I purchased this tire gauge for my cars. I love the digital, something I never had before. Very good price for a quality product."
5,Easy to read display,Red lit display is easy to read. Tire gauge has the best ergomics. Does not leave air escape while taking reading.
4,A purchase of value,I went by previous comments.Find it easy to use with a good grip.Enables one to use it with minimal air loss from the valve.
1,Eats Batteries,"My Accutire tire gauge eats batteries, lasting only about 5 months of weekly use. It takes 3 watch batteries, so this is a very expensive tire gauge when replacement parts are considered."
2,Battery = Short Term Life,"Like other digital gauges, this one lasts a year and then its dead. Battery can not be replaced.Its better for your wallet and environment to go with a mechanical gauge."
1,accutire MS-4021B ~ DOA,"Gauge is easy to read. Only read it ever gave was -0.0.I requested a replacement, hope it works. The return procedure is easy and prepaid shipping, so 1 star for Amazon, 0 star for the gauge."
1,Easy to use but not accurate and not precise,"Puchased on sale at Sears. Very disappointed but didn't save receipt. In taking multiple readings, the values ranged from 28 to 36 psi on a single tire. No trend. Just jumps around. My old $4 Harbor Tool dial gauge and $7 Wal Mart gauge gave accuracy and precison reading +/- 0.5 psi when eying between lines."
3,Not bad.,"Very accurate. Easy to use. After a year of using it, the plastic tip broke off and pressure was used to read accurately. Overall good while it lasted."
5,Very easy to use,"I bought this so I didn't have to guess which tire needed air when the low pressure light came up on my vehicle. It's very easy to use and it's a time saver. I bought it back when it was cheaper, around $7.50, and it beat my expectations."
2,Short life,"Has stopped working after 2.5 years. Used it maybe half a dozen times, stored in glove compartment. Shouldn't it have lasted longer?"
5,Works well - no complaints!,"I'm impressed with this gauge. I've owned it for several months now, and have no complaints. It feels solid and well-made, the display is easily visible, and it's fairly easy to press over the valve stem. Haven't had to replace batteries yet. It's apparently accurate - it reads within 1 PSI of my other digital gauge (different brand) and my old ""stick"" gauge, and it's much easier to read than either of those!Great gift idea!"
4,Great item but needs an improvement,I bought this because it got high rating by Consumer Reports. It works great and it's very well designed...except...the thing missing is a little knob (or whatever you want to call it) to release air from the tire. I have to have another old stick gauge handy to do that job. Otherwise I love it.
4,Tire Gauge,My husband received it as a Christmas gift. He tested it out today and really likes it. It will do the truck tires just great.
4,Accutire ms-4021B Tire Gauge,I Have several of these gauges. They all work good and are accurate. The battery lasts a long time. The price is very reasonable !!! They are fairly easy to read in normal light. The value for the money and quality is good.
4,Seems good so far...,"Though the gauge itself looks pretty slick, the feel is a bit cheaper than I'd anticipated. Doesn't let out too much air when checking, and drops roughly .5 psi every 2 or 3 readings. Sensitivity is good enough to show a reading just from me blowing into it, and displays for about 8 seconds. All and all I'd say a worthwhile purchase, and while not the highest quality, for the price it's hard to beat."
4,Accutire Digital Tire Gauge,"I bought this to be able to easily check my tires. It is very compact, easy to use, and fits right in the glove compartment."
5,Hubby is very happy with this,Hubbs bought this to put in his trailer. He seems to really like it. It is fast and pretty accurate. It was a consumer reports reccomemdation
5,big bright LEDs,"Big bright easy to read, accurate. Can't beat it! Price and quality are great. A must have for the glovebox."
4,Super quick way to check tire pressure,"I love this gauge. All that is needed to get your pressure is a quick tap on the valve and voila! The only downside to this gauge is that it has a somewhat awkward curve to it with the handle which makes it somewhat hard to measure my motorcycle's tire pressure because it is in the middle of the wheel with a large disc brake in the way. It would be nice to be able to disconnect the black handle part of the gauge for this reason. Also, it would have been nice for some sort of beep when it has the pressure, because the screen is hard to see while I'm jamming it into my motorcycle rim. Other than that, its a great product at a great price."
5,finally,now we are able to check the pressure in our big tires without having to go to a gas station
2,Very fragile.,"I've bought two of these. Both broke after being dropped from tire height. (OK, I'm clumsy.) Great otherwise, and cheap enough, but I'll buy something else next."
1,DO NOT BUY!,Gauge works but after a week THE BATTERIES DIED?$5 for batteries at Walgreens.Plus the hassle.
1,Broke after only one use,"Used it once when it was first purchased. Didn't need to use it for 12 months. Tried and it didn't work. Replaced the batteries ($12 cost), still doesn't work.Rubbish."
3,Don't Get What You Buy,"You don't get what you buy in this photo, which is really weird in my opinion. So part of my rating is that.Otherwise, it's a decent tool. I doubt it works too well, and I doubt it is terribly accurate. Gets the job done with the ease that a normal stick tool can't do."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"Unit arrived dead on arrival. For what I paid for it it wasn't worth the hassle of sending it back, or troubleshooting it to see if the batteries were dead."
1,The product description lies,"Amazon's product features description says, and I quote directly, ""Accurate to within 0.05 PSI, reading air pressure from 5-150 PSI in 0.5 pound increments."" That has a specific meaning, and that is a lie. The product's own packaging says, ""Accuracy +/- 1%"" which is something quite different. If, like me, you were fooled into thinking that this is a higher quality gauge that simply reports a reduced accuracy for the sake of making things simple for a normal consumer, well, now you know that it is not. It's a cheap gauge like all the others; may as well save $5 and get a cheapy.I've been an Amazon customer since the beginning, and it is disheartening to see the increasing frequency with which it gets its product descriptions wrong."
4,Good Product,I have one of these and they work great. The only short coming I have found is that the display does go away a little bit quickly. Very accurate and easy to use.
2,Hard to get a good seal,"This device is disappointing. The 1st time I tried it, I couldn't get a reading other than 0.00. I was ready to give up on it, but I tried again a few days later. I was able to get a reading but it took multiple attempts per tire. I must have lost a few pounds of air pressure from each tire since it was so difficult to get a tight seal. I wanted to send it back to Amazon but according to the invoice they will only take it back within 30 days and I had waited too long to test out this device."
1,Broke after a few uses,"I bought this one and the other model MS-4652B to try both, but this one stopped showing the pressure after a few uses. The battery still works, but the pressure is always shown as 0.It was great while it worked."
1,Second Worst Guage I Ever Bought,The seal between the valve stem and guage is non existant.It is hard rather than rubber or something. Impossible toget a non leaking reading with out lots of air escapingwhile trying to take a measurement. The guage's accuracyis of no use. Never make a good seal with the valve stem.Worst guage was the Accutire MS-4000B Tire Gauge. It wouldnot seal but was harder to work mechanically.
5,accurate tire pressure gauge,I bought 4 of these and checked them for accuracy as soon as they were received. 3 of them read the exact same pressure (35) and the 4th only differed by 1/2 pound. This is better accuracy than any dial type gauge I have ever had.The gauge seems very accurate right down to 5 psi which is good for the mower tires.Would definitely buy this again.
5,very accurate,"checking the air pressure in tires was a hassle. i never knew which pressure gauge to use because they all had different readings (i have about 6 from wal mart). now i just use the accutire guage on trucks, tractors, cars, and rv."
1,Dead on arrival,After changing batteries it was stillafter changing batteries it was stillAfter changing batteries it was still DOA.I threw it in the trash.Sorry but I had to be truthful.Phil W
4,A Top Tire Pressure Gauge,"The Accutire MS-4012B is easy to use and accurate. Seems durable enough for household use, but probably not one for commercial use.It could be improved if there was something to let air out of the tire when the tire is over inflated - somewhat of a pain to check pressure, remove gauge, insert nail or something to let air our, recheck pressure and start all over again, until you get the right pressure."
3,Alright,"For the few times that I have used this gauge, it has been pretty accurate. The size as well is convenient for me, so I can keep this in my car without it being a nuisance.However, the fact that the batteries cannot be changed is a rather large nuisance. Apparently only the manufacturer can change the batteries for you, but the wait isn't as expedient, so do give yourself time if you are in extreme need of a gauge."
5,Does what it should do!,"I've had this for about a year now,used it to check pressures in my truck and also my wife's SUV. I'd say that I have used it 20 or so times with out any problems,and it is still working to this date. Works as described."
5,Great Tire Gauge,This gauge is accurate and repeated measurements yield identical results.I particularly value that this gauge is accurate to less than 5 psi. That makes it very useful for the small tires on lawn equipment.I have been using two earlier models (without back light) for over 5 years and have had no problems.
5,Great gauge for the price,"This digital gauge replaced an older digital gauge (also by Accutire).Overall I am very happy with this gauge. My car has a 19"" chrome wheel with a 4"" lip. My old gauge had 2 problems: its not easy getting to the valve stem, and during measurement, its easy to leak air, hard to find a position NOT to leak...This Accutire MS-4021B fixed both problems. Its also alot cheaper, if you buy from Amazon that is.5 stars."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had the same problem as Peter, the gauge would read 28.5 on all tires and even during ""calibration"". No display movement,a constant 28.5. This must be a comman defect."
1,Defective,Received tire gauge and upon first use it did not give a reading and the screen was blank but the light on it was glowing. Tried multiple tires and multiple times go get a reading and nothing. Returned it and am looking for a different model.
1,Useless,Did not work at all. Only registers 18.88 and LL. No way to fix. Unfortunately did not try until 60 days after purchase so it goes in the trash.
5,Good product,Seems accurate so far. Easy tu use. Good grip. Reasonably priced. Wish it would have included a case. Would recommend this product.
4,Good value for money,Readings were fast and accurate (as far as I could tell). Definitely worth the money - saw it on sale at my local carwash for twice the price.
2,Don't keep in car!,Don't leave the pressure guage in the car! It will be toasted. I lost two the same day because the temperature in the car got too hot. The 100 deg F temperature limit is simply too low for practical use.
5,An essential tool for proper maintenance of your tires,"A digital tire gauge is very helpful in maintaining the correct pressure for your tires. It has a bright digital display of the tire pressure and holds it for several seconds even after you have taken it off the tire valve. The pressure readings are in 0.5 psi increments. I had one that I have used for over three years. When I bought another car, I purchased another Accutire gauge so that I could have one in each car."
4,nice little digital tire gauge,"cheap, works well with accurate digital reading and easy to read display. Only reason i gave it 4 stars is because im not sure how long it will last or how accurate it will stay since as with everything else in this country, its made in china"
5,BEST TIRE GAUGE FOR THE MONEY!,"I have two of these now, one for each car --and I use it for my horse trailer tires. Definitely better than a base pogo type gauge and best digital at a great price! There is no need to spend more money on a gauge and I have had my other (original)one going on 5yrs and it still works perfect!"
1,Very poor battery life,"Seems like every time I go to use this gauge I have to install new batteries. Gauge is accurate and very easy to use, but, next to worthless as the batteries drain down quickly when stored between uses."
4,Consistent but tricky measurement,"Measurements are repeatably consistent and seem to match other gauges I trust. However, this gauge results in more missed connections that end up leaking air than other gauges."
2,Good at first but not durable,Bought it 3 years ago. It has been used in our 2 car family (i.e. residential use only). Dead last week for no reason.
1,very dissatisfied,I tried this gauge on my vehicle. It was not accurate by any stretch and not consistant. It also let a lot of air out of the tires. I cannot recommend this at all and will be sending this back right away a different one.
2,My experience,"I bought this gage 3 years ago. I was very happy with it, however after 3 years it quit working, kept saying ""L"" (I believe is what it said. It has a life time warranty, which is really worthless, because you have to pay to ship it back, and what it costs to ship it, is not worth it for what I paid for the gage. I expect a gage that is carefully taken care of to last for many years, and this gage did not do it. I will not buy another Accutire gage. The instructions said to return it to where I bought it from, AND SEE if they will exchange it. They wanted the receit. I did not keep the receit handy where I could easily find it. Buy a better quality gage."
1,Never showed up!,"Almost forgot I had ordered this, then just gave up. Thanks for nothing. Paid so little for it, just wasn't worth the effort. Guess I know why it was so cheap."
1,"poor performance, temperatur sensitive","Difficult to get a seal with the fitting, too loose. Hard to read. Read 2 lbs lower than premium mechanical gauge. Very dubious. Weird calibration method in instructions, hard to carry out. forget it.specification emphasizes temperature sensitivity and operating range no higher than 100f. If kept in glove compartment in summer, may get too hot to operate.It's normal for electronics to have limited high temperature operation. The old mechanical meters have their advantages."
4,A Great Tire Gauge,I love this tire gauge. It has always worked perfectly. The batteries lasted over 6 years from the day I bought it. I highly recommend.
5,Great,"This gauge is insanely easy to use. Had it for over a year now, use it every week (me and my workmates)on our bicyles and it's still on the original batteries. It's accurate, easy to read and perfect for the job."
3,Not good in the cold,"As long as the temp is above freezing, works fine, accurate and easy to read. In cold weather rubber becomes hard and does not give a good seal; lcd screen stops giving an accurate display in very cold weather, below 10F. The workaround is to leave it in the house during the winter, and only bring it out to take the tire pressure."
3,Very good but only two years...,"I bought two of this 2 years ago... the tool worked very well, I can't complain about that.Sadly, mine died about a month ago with the ""L"" error (Power supply depleted) which is covered under warranty ""free of charged""... but for a tool that says ""5 years warranty"" I think 2 years of life is not good enough 'though my father has the other one and it's still working...If possible I would give it a 3.5 stars rating, taking away one star for dying in less than 50% of the factory warranty time and half a star because sometimes it was a little difficult to gauge some tires without the air escaping (just some times)...Even if I could send it to the factory (with package freight prepaid) I think it's easier and perhaps cheaper to just buy another two.Will I buy them?... Yes, It's a good product."
4,"Quick, efficient, easy to use.","If you need an easy to use, easy to read tire pressure gauge, this one does the trick and does it well. The product description is a tad misleading as I found it to feel a bit cheap from the plastic it's made from."
4,Good tire gauge,This digital gauge is no-nonsense in design and use. It is rated as very accurate by a leading testing publication. The gauge is easy to use and does one thing well...measure tire pressure. I would have given this a perfect rating if the tip was more sturdy and made of metal rather than plastic.
5,"Accurate, good hold, rough and tough","I'd originally bought an analog gauge from some car store for like 4 bucks; which turned out to be very inconsistent in its readings. So, after this arrived, this first thing I did was to check the accuracy of this gauge with my Jeep which just returned from the dealership after servicing. They'd set the tires to 40 psi, and sure enough this one showed this exact reading. I've used this with gloves in snow, with mud while offroading, and its still going strong. I'm just ordering another one to keep in my other car. Its a high quality product, and I'd buy it, even if they'd charge more for this thing. The batteries it takes cost like 2 bucks for a pack of 10 or something."
1,Maybe I just a (really) defective one!,"Perhaps mine was just bad, judging by some of the better reviews. However, I returned mine to Amazon immediately. No point in messing around with it. Really lousy instrument. Does not create a seal on the air valve and instead allows air to be released and the nozzle on the instrument separates and has to be clipped back together again. Useless."
3,just started,I have recently just started to take the weight smart regimen. I believe that this will help me to establish a healthy wight. Since I have started taking weight smart I have lost 10lbs and I feel so much healthier and happier. I feel energetic. I would reccomend it to those that would like to get there lives feeling a bit better. I think that 10lbs in 2wks is totally awesome.
4,Works for me,"I started using Weight Smart One a Day two weeks ago and have lost 2.8 Kilos (6 pounds). I have combined this with some minor changes in my diet, like drinking only water (no sodas)and replacing very high calorie foods with lower calorie choices, but I am convinced that this product is speeding up the weight loss process. The only draw back is that you definitely need to take it with food as I experienced strong nausea when I took it on an empty stomach."
1,Weight Loss by Nausea,"OK...I've tried to eat with this vitamin, too, and it always causes nausea. Today, I actually got sick...Not worth it to me...I'll just stick to my regular multivitamin."
2,Not Worth The Nausea,It's just a basic multi-vitamin with awful side effects. I found that I got better results by taking a normal vitamin - that DOESN'T cause the day-ruining nausea - and drinking a mug of green tea. Mix that in with a healthier diet and moderate exercize and you'll have a winner.You don't have to suffer the ill after effects of taking this pill without food -- take something normal with a yummy mug of tea and walk around a bit. It's healthier and less painful to the digestive tract.
3,A horse is a horse....this isn't Mr. Ed.,It's a multivitamin. It didn't cause any weight loss with me...only an upset tummy when I took it w/o food.Ruth
4,You have to sacrifice something!!,"I've been taking this product for over a year now. I started when I joined Weight Watchers. I successfully lost over 20 lbs using this product, exercising, and following the Weight Watchers program. The things I noticed is ""sleepless nights"" - especially if it is taken late in the day. I have to allow my body time to exercise and burn the metabolism down before bedtime. Also, ""nausea stomach"" if taken on an empty stomach. Otherwise, I believe it does what it promises to do. I guess you have to sacrifice somewhere or something!!!"
1,"Supposed to make me healthier, but makes me sick!","I took this a couple of years ago and LOVED it....got lazy...went back to it last week. Turns out, they changed the formulation and it makes me so SICK! Nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, headaches, crankiness....steer clear of this one!"
3,Yeah...,"...it does give you nausea. A lot. I suggest taking this along with some herbal stomach settler thing, which is what I do. And stick to healthy food and exercise and all that stuff. Maybe the nauseousness is supposed to prevent you from eating...? Don't know. Seems pretty common among everyone who's taken it. I haven't been taking it long so I don't know the results of it yet, so I'm sticking with the middle-of-the-line 3 stars."
3,mixed opinion,"well about 3 years ago I took this vitamin daily combined with running a little bit a day, and I seriously went from being 118 pds to 105 pds, now 3 years later at age 20 I have started taking it again after gaining a bunch of laziness weight here in college and I am constantly full and my stomach hurts no matter what or how much of anything I eat, I am hoping that my body will adjust to the vitamin so I'll stick it out a little longer, if not then screw the vitamin I'll go back to the other ones, I do recommend Women's ONE-A_Day though with extra calcium"
2,Nothing special. May require iron stomach.,"As others have said, this is just a regular multi-vitamin. They put the Weight Smart tag on there for marketing to those of use trying to lose weight.I guess some of us have more sensitive stomaches, but I get nauseous even when I DO eat at the same time I take this (as is suggested).Not sure I will keep using this when the bottle is gone unless my body can handle it better at that time."
1,Horrible...,"I do think that adding the b vitamins to my diet did improve the texture of my skin, but it just has way too much caffeine. I guess taking this multivitamin made me realize that I am caffeine sensitive. Just an hour after taking it my breathing and heart rate increased and I became jittery, resembling an anxiety attack. It didn't just last a few hours, it lasted ALL DAY. I wish they had just increased the b vitamins for extra energy instead of adding so much caffeine. I'm thinking of buying a different $10 dollar bottle of multivitamins because this one is so hard on my body."
3,Suggestion for stomach upset,"Well, I actually just bought this product and I haven't used it yet, but I have a suggestion for those worried about stomach upset while taking this vitamin. Take a ginger root capsule with it. Ginger root is AMAZING at keeping your stomach settled and ""in its place"". I use it for motion sickness all the time. I will try this and repost later on. Ginger root can be found at any health food store and its not very expensive, and its safe and natural."
1,Pain in my stomach,I didn't feel nausea at all. I felt pain in my stomach as if there was a huge knot in it. Took me awhile to figure out what was causing it. I've never had a problem taking vitamins before.
1,Burn calories- add caffeine,"I didn't see if anyone had problems sleeping after starting this supplement. It has caffeine powder as well as green tea extract (EGCG, Epigallo Catechin Gallate), not ECGC."
2,Not much has changed,"I have been using this product for over two weeks now and I feel no change in my energy, metabolism or weight. However, everyone taking this product must realize that it isn't a miracle pill...and things that claim to be will most likely kill you in the long run anyways. Just keep in mind that it is a multi-vitamin so you are getting something good out of it, but most especially...all us lazy people really need to work out and stop wishing for a miracle...it's so upsetting!"
4,No problems,"I have read many reviews on this product about nausea and how terrible this product is. I decided to buy it to give it a try. It is not a weight loss pill, it is just to help boost your metabolism. I feel that it has helped me a little. I started excercising and taking this and I guess that combination of the two helped. It says that it is supposed to help give you energy, but it does not give me energy at all. Also many people say they have experienced nausea. It is a multi-vitamin. You must eat something when you take it. I have taken it on an empty stomach before though and I felt no nausea at all! It all depends on the person, but it does not hurt to try. What doesn't work for some might work for others! I would definitely suggest giving it a try though. Again, this isn't some miracle weight loss pill!!! Don't expect to shed 20 pounds. It just helps with your matabolism."
2,This was so horrible compared to the other movies.,"In the first seen Belinda and her friend look like two models on their way to the next photo shoot. Not like doctors on their way to a town in the old west. I can't stand the actress they picked to play Belinda. She was so expressionless and lifeless. I much prefer the darker haired actress of the prier film; she was spunky and full of life. This new girl was like ""yes I'll marry you"" with absolutely no expression or emotion.They turned the last two films into more feminist rhetoric then a Christian message. In fact there was no Christian message.And what is with them making the first husband of every main character die????? It's like a family tradition.I enjoyed Patrick Duffy and Cloris Leachman but I didn't like seeing Lou Diamond Phillips as the bad guy. Over all not a great story but not bad directing and a wide range of acting from really bad to great."
5,Love is and always will be alive~!,"I rented this movie having no idea what it was about and in the end I was crying like an idiot. The movie (as described in so many reviews) reminded me of the 'old times' - the old Hallmark movies or made for TV movies. These two gals - excuse me--two women doctors come to work in two dirty, rustic and whatever you want to call crappy towns in those days (I'm sure glad I wasn't born then-yuck).Anyway they save the day and though it's sort of predictable it never-the-less was a wonderful rememberence of the old western or western-type shows I watched as a kid. No cussing, no nudity, just plain good story where everything is horrible and then things turn and there are heros. If you want to see a wonderful family movie get this one--it's totally worth your time and a few tears!!Sher Holtz"
1,Nothing like the books,"These movies are awful. Love Comes Softly was the best since it stuck closest to the actual story line of the book, but the later movies are nothing like the books. Having read and loved the books, I can't stand watching these movies. If they are going to stray so far from the original story, then perhaps they should have different titles and not be associated with Janette Oke at all. I'm surprised she approved of these movies being made."
4,My opinion and the Love comes softly series,The first three movies in the series followed the books by Janette Oke to a tee. The director in moviesin 4-8 took way to many liberties.In the books Belinda was Marty's youngest daughter.Melissa's husband didn't die either.Also when is the last movie Love Finds a Home due out on dvd?
3,Not quite as expected,"The movie is a great move and it plays well, however, it wasn't received as I had thought from the add. The movie had been opened and it appears to be a movie that had been pre-owned/rented out. This movie has a label on it from ""Video News""."
3,Love takes wing,"Love takes wing was not as good a the first Loves comes softly, but still entertaining."
1,sadly dreadful,"Well after loving the first couple of ""love comes.."" I have no idea what happened to the latest one.From the dreadful continuity of silver wig in one scene (why - she is young?) to the same scene but she suddenly has blonde/red hair. To over sermonising - shoving down throat (which wasn't in the first couple of ""love comes""). And most of all lack of development of character and story. The characters weren't real and you end up not caring what happened to them.It was a good theme - ""loosing faith"" but just wasn't explored or allowed to develop correctly.It looked like the director, producer suddenly had the smallest budget and gave up.The last ""love comes"" wasn't as good as the others but it stood head and shoulders taller than this one.Give this one a miss and just remember how good the others were."
3,Too cute to be true,"This movie takes place in the late 1800s, but in a ""magical land"" when good guys (and girls) are smart and beautiful, bad guys are ugly, the diseases are cured, and everybody lives happily ever after. In a way, this movie is more a Christian fairy tale than historical fiction. Some parts of the movie are anachronistic, such as female doctors and a frontier doctor inventing intravenous injections. Nonetheless, this is a decent family movie. The acting is good and the story is moving. The Christian overtone to the film sometimes gets annoying, particularly the orphanage manager's comments, but it's not too bad. Appropriate for kids."
3,The Artist on the album,"The one main problem with this album is that some of the artist on it was not properly recognized or promoted. Some of the groups on the album actually did have great songs during the 90's I think the problem was really with the guy King George himself not giving them the recognition that was deserved. For Ex. there are songs on there and you do not know which one of the artist actually performed it because the track was not titled correctly. Personally Im trying to find out who is the group that performed the track on the cd called One Shot One Kill, and its not even listed on the cd but it is on the cassette. Who organized this material???"
3,Breezy world-beat fusion from former Spyro Gyra sideman,"Jeremy Wall's second solo release presents a consistent set of his breezy world-beat jazz compositions anchored by his piano and electronic keyboards. Additional instrumental spice is provided by Grant Geissman's nylon-string guitar, Jeff Pevar's electric guitar, Dave Samuel's vibes & marimba, Richard Stoltzman's clarinet, Lew Soloff's trumpet and flugelhorn, and Tom ""Bones"" Malone, on trombone of course. Danny Gottlieb on drums and Barry Campbell and Jay Anderson on basses provide solid rhythmic backing. Vaneese Thomas provides a good lead vocal on ""Fly Away"", the sole track with English lyrics. The third-world ethnic flavor is particularly prominent on the opening and closing tracks, via a chanted group vocal that fades out a-cappella. Current Spyro guitarist Julio Fernandez and Israeli singer-songwriter David Broza lent their voices to this chorus."
5,Great story,"Love the humor, characters and storyline. Lauren Royal has quickly become one of my favorite HR authors. When she has a book come out, I don't even bother to read the summary, I know it will be awesome!"
3,Good story-too much sex,"Good story line-unnecessary description of sex.Not for teens. I enjoy a good book, and am mot a prude, but too much is too much!"
4,Loved it. Would recommend this bk to any n everyone!,"Absolutely wonderful. loved the characters of Lily & Rand. Rose, Lily""s elder sister wants Rand for herself n makes Lily promise to leave him alone. Lily tries to stay loyal to her sister but Rand has absolutely no interest in Rose & has never forgotten Lily since they 1st met 4 years ago at Ford & Violet, Lily's eldest sister's wedding (bk 1). Their attraction soon culminates in love n i liked that Lily realized that keeping her promise to Rose was meaningless. I was surprised that the declaration of love part occurred less that 1/2 way thru the bk. The 2nd 1/2 was just as interesting. The path to Lily n Rand's HEA was a fantastic read indeed.Lily's menagerie of animals were most endearing n amusing too.I totally agree with all the reviewers who gave a favourable review to this book. I've read several of Lauren Royal's book n i liked all of them other than Emerald."
4,The Lodge,"So since this movie doesn't really have any reviews from people who weren't involved in making it at the moment, I figured I would give my two cents. So I hadn't heard much on this movie and frankly expected crap so I must say that I was pretty pleasantly surprised. The movie does get off to a slow start, but the bulk of it is paced very well. The story is derivative of many survival horror flicks that preceded it but it still manages to be entertaining and does add a unique angle to the happenings that works very well. I don't want to say too much because it would reveal too much. The acting is pretty good, but there is a lack of nudity and bloodshed, which didn't hurt the movie too badly, but some gore would have been nice. The Lodge is a pretty solid horror flick that may not tread much new ground, but packs a rather large entertainment factor."
2,"Slow, boring, but good atmosphere","This film obviously tells the story of a couple that decides to rent a remote cabin for the weekend, only to find its rentor go bad on them. While the film maintained a good atmosphere throughout, it was largely uneventful. The film opens with a scene that pretty much lays out exactly what will happen throughout this film. This is a dangerous approach, imho, telling your audience what the ending will be well before you get there, and it doesn't work on this film. Rather than the discomfort that could have stemmed from the creepy unknowns of the rentor, we know exactly his intentions throughout, which largely marginalizes any tension that would otherwise be present. And without that tension, we're left with a film that takes forever to get to anything meaty, so its boring. Its too bad that the great work in creating atmosphere wasn't matched by engaging action and good content."
1,Wow...not very eventfull,"The movie has a very slow pace throughout. I found myself bored but kept hoping it would pick up. The actors didn't seem very scared, happy, or much of anything....they seemed bored. When the ""bad guy"" was revealed...he was rather boring. Considering all the psycho/sociopathic killers featured in movies this one was very bland. His looks (no mask made of human flesh) and his actions (no derranged orphan who killed off everyone) were very vanilla. The bad guy even died very easily, no tense, end of your seat, struggle to the death fight. The only interesting point in the movie was the girl with the bad guy; but the movie never gave much information about her."
2,Meh.,"Let's just say the film's two best assets were on the chest of the lead actress. Other than those, there's not much to recommend this."
5,Rock Princess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i just saw the 4 most beautiful dolls eva made .the bratz hollywood dolls are georgus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you want to see what they look like go on to ebay .Hint:buy the myscene Lindsay Lohan doll so she can be the celeb of your bratz .I hope this was helpfulP.S stop saying bratz rule my scene drule .even though im a 1# bratz fan its not nice.If u dont like it how they bad mouth us .They wont like it either.And any way it will show were more macture.
3,Not as good as I expected.,"I am a big fan of Benjamin Zander's Mahler. His 4th is the best I have ever heard, and the 5th, 6th and 9th are highly commendable. Zander's insights in his hour long lectures included with each symphony are worth the price of the package which is already a bargain. Thanks to Zander, after 30 years of wrestling with the 9th, I finally understand it. The 3rd, however, is a bit off the mark. It isn't by any means a bad performance, but there are better. My favorites are Bernstein with the New York Philharmonic on DGG and Riccardo Chailly with the Concertgebouw on Decca (a knockout performance by any standards.) I also recommend Bernstein or Michael Tilson-Thomas for the 1st and 6th and Bernstein or Claudio Abbado for the 7th."
5,Does the trick.,"The book provides the info needed. It does not provide the jeweler's loupe or microscope, judgment or practice needed. Judgment comes with practice. The sample prep technique is very important. When I started trying out the technique outlined by the book, my first impression was wow, this is harder than you would think - then I started to see what the author was talking about, and started identifying mystery wood with certainty. Very satisfying to do. It takes more time to learn the method than you would think, but I cannot think of a better way to go about identifying wood. A very good book, if identifying wood is your goal."
4,COOL,This book was a new experience for Goosebump fans. I personaly thinkthat they got better as he wrote more.
2,Very confusing,Very hard to follow and not very interesting. You can't even tell what is going on. I gave it two stars because the plot was a good idea. The rest of the book is -------{} a pie in the face. I reccomend you stay away from this book.
5,Not a bad deal for the price.,"It's a great deal. Walking around with it on takes some getting used to, but I can't complain. It's wild seeing deer walking around and eating the plums off the trees. I've taken back the night PEOPLE!;) Have fun all!I'd like to see what the difference between Gen I and Gen II and III. But the price will keep me from being that curious."
1,Lens are reflective!,Title says it all brotha. The lady I was looking at through the window saw my lenses clear as day.Useless product!
2,Not a good enough upgrade from 2004 to warrant the $50,"Pros: the more customization of players and courses.New courses such as Colonial, Troon North Monument, Turnberry. Edgewood at Tahoe.Cons: Dropped great courses (unless I somehow can't find them), including Torrey Pines, Pinehurst, Bethpage, Royal Birkdale, Spyglass Hill, Sahalee, TPC Scottsdale, and Poppy Hills.Game play is pretty much idential to preveious years.Equipment manufacturers OK = Taylor Made, Ping, Cleveland, Callaway, Nike, and this year Dunlop. Also can buy shafts. But where is the big boy of the golf ball market - Titleist?I'm all for adding improvements in the area of customization for players, but not at the expense of courses to play on. I suggest that if you already have 2004, don't bother buying 2005. If you don't have 2004, 2005 might be a good purchase."
5,A Yuri Must Have!,"Simoun has a ""mecha"" feel to this Yuri style story. However from the beginning, you do get hooked on the concept for the basis of the story behind Simoun. And if you like Yuri Style Anime, this is a collection must have! Aeru (blond) and Neviril (pink) are the main charactors and you quickly become attached to their backgrounds. Simoun has a great Charactor Base and a heart warming story with a slight bitter/sweet ending! Buy you copy today!"
5,A new Wagner tradtion rising,"Tradition is always important for music, composing as well as conducting. This recording starts what I would like to call a new tradition in Wagner conducting. The flow of Böhm and Karajan is combined with the power of Solti in a constellation never heard before. One of the most excellent recordings of the opera, of cause Anne Evans is not Birgit Nilsson, but she might be the new Birgit Nilsson, at least under Barenboim's baton. Poul Elming a powerful Siegmund, Nadine Secunde a brilliant Sieglinde, and of cause John Tomlinson's absolutely excellent Wotan. The new Wotan, in power and control in his dispair: 'Watch out Hans Hotter'. Barenboim makes the most out of the score, in a unconventional tempi, playing with a dynamic that makes the myth of past time enter your living room. Highly recommended. If you love Wagner, You can't live without this recording."
2,We now know what?,"The worst type of Cold Warrior propaganda. Gaddis dares be outraged by the Soviet Union's spies in the US, as if the United States didn't have their own spies in the Soviet Union. More of the same tired, ""The Cold War was all the fault of the USSR. The noble United States would never be anything less than completely fair and objective."" HAH!!! Forced to read this for a graduate seminar, it was a waste of time. A little more objectivity would be nice, and perhaps a touch of reality outside of the Reagan sphere of influence. Although, if the phrase ""We're from the government, we're here to help you,"" does not strike terror into your heart, you'd probably truly enjoy this one-sided treatise on the causes and effects of the Cold War. I give it two stars because even though I couldn't sell it back, the size was perfect to block a hole in a baseboard so one of my cats wouldn't get stuck in the wall anymore."
1,Really awful,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
1,Terrible Event,"UFC 51 is a joke of an event, especially the main event. The decision in the Tito/Belfort fight is atrocious and robs the rightful victory of the win, leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind."
2,Rent it first.......,"A lot has already been covered in previous reviews. My biggest gripe is a lack of head to head play in season mode! If you are playing another person you have to play on the same team unless you are in quick game mode. In season mode you can no longer have you and your friend pick 2 fav teams and play the season out. You now have to select all 30 teams and sim all the other games which seem to arise out of order and you and up doing a sim game on the one you wished to play.Secondly, the manual for this game is about 4 pages long. If you are not already familiar with previous NHL gameplay, you will be a bit lost.Rent this game even though it's under $30......"
2,major disappointment,"just not up to par...limited game modes...awkward game play...no ea sports bio or rewards...ESPN 2K5 is much, much better at under $20"
3,Meh?,"I really like Junko Mizuno's work, but for whatever reason pure trance failed to grab me. The art is all there, and if you like her stuff get it, but her re-tooled versions of Hansel and Grettel and other European folklore are more interesting, more focused efforts"
1,Disappointed,"Not as soft as it looks, actually kind of rough, wears poorly. After a few days it looked matted and very worn. The satin backing is not satin/silky at all. AND it smelled kind of funny when I took it out of the box. AND to make matters worse, this balnket is DRY CLEAN ONLY!"
1,Not a full workout,This DVD is only a partial sample of a workout. If I had to guess it was intended to be a free giveaway with the purchase of another item once upon a time. Do not buy!
1,Bad!!!!,Not good!! No examples solved in the book and no answers to all the execercises. Really bad book. Book only for professors
5,Under This Roof,I read this book for the first time when I was in Junior High School--aroound 1961--and loved it. Our local library had a sale of old books many years later. While going through the books I found the book I had read years earlier. Under This Roof is a very endearing tale of a young woman and her younger siblings trying to make a life together after the sudden death of their parents. I have read the book many times and never tire of reading it.
1,Caution! Might not fit! EXPENSIVE.,"These bulbs, in addition to not being bright enough, may not fit through the plastic backing of your rear light assembly. I could not get them to fit on my 2008 Honda Ridgeline. Not Recommended. It might work if your vehicle rear lenses remove, and not the whole plastic assembly. All in all though, not a good value for the price. A package of two regular incandescent 7443's will run you $6 at the auto store. This is a 5x markup for two."
1,Check fit,I was assured that this would fit my '06 Subaru Forester. The opening is too small.BEWARE of info given as to fit may not work!
2,Be careful Buying this,I don't actually know how well the bulb works. The problem is that the outside dimension of this bulb is large. It was too large to fit in the space of the OEM tail light. So be extra careful and take some measurements of where the replacement bulb is going.
2,Not a good compilation of cartoon,Not the cartoons I wanted....would have like the titles of cartoons to be listed in the description~so I could see if I wanted it...not the sellers fault...
4,beautiful tunes,"I discovered this CD when it was recommended to me as a result of my other music searches. I was familiar with one of the songs played on a local NPR station, so decided to give the CD a try. I was very pleased, and this CD goes into my player anytime I feel like winding down, contemplating life, or making art. It's great music to mellow out to, and I highly recommend it."
4,"No Need To Weep, Just Enjoy","What a refreshing album! Simple, smart, catchy folk pop. There are no bad songs here. Fans of vocal harmonies will love this album."
3,Reminds me of Buckingham Nicks . . .,". . . though less flashy. Buckingham Nicks + Bonus is the album that led Mick Fleetwood to invite Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to join Fleetwood Mac.Any guitarist who wants to be truly versatile should listen to that album -- and this one.A few portions of the vocals are a little too ""sweet"" for my tastes but there are many beautiful passages (harmonies, melodies and guitar) that nearly anyone can enjoy."
5,so sweet,"I love the weepies. This husband and wife duo have such a sweet back story (Check out their website if you are interested) that seems to carry into their music. The music can get a little pop-ish for my tastes at times, but most of the songs are uplifting. I think the groups greatest asset is Deb Talan's voice. It is completely unique. I much prefer her songs (and her solo work) to her husbands. This is a good sunny day, skippingly happy day cd. If you are looking for melancholy, look elsewhere."
4,Better Eat Your Weepies,"True to the group's name, this album is mournful and introspective, what Jack Black's ""High Fidelity"" character would describe as ""sad bastard music."" But that doesn't mean you won't find yourself bobbing your head and tapping your foot along with the highly-melodic rhythms from ""Say I Am You."" There are no throw-away tracks, and several gems, including the enormously catchy ""Painting By Chigall"" and the understated beauty of ""Stars."""
4,Suprisingly amazing,"I just bought it because I liked the cover art. That's not entirely true, I did hear one of their songs on the Paste sample CD. Anyway, this is smart music; smart lyrics, smart melodies and smart writing. It's very soft, subtle music (which is where I'm at musically right now). Most of the songs focus on the vocals which means that the listener will listen to the lyrics. I can't say enough about the song ""The World Spins Madly On"" Blew me away when I first heard it and still does. It sounds like a Fountains of Wayne song, not to mention he sounds a little bit like Adam Slessinger. Never before have I heard a song about the world moving on while I silently sit still and think about the opportunities I've passed up, sung so well.I also love ""painting by chagall"" and I don't even like Chagall's work all that much. This is the Belle and Sebastian album for people who don't like Belle and Sebastian."
4,Like spending an afternoon in a swaying hammock,"A friend of mine sent me the link to this and I fell in love instantly. It's cool and soft without being boring. When I got it, I listened to it non-stop for days on end. This is not pumping, thumping club music. Nor will it incite riots amongst angst ridden teens. It's more along the lines of what it would be like if Paul Simon had a child with Shawn Colvin. It's soothing yet smart. Highly recommended for any Sunday afternoon."
4,New Folk Sound,I heard The Weepies on the season finale of Everwood on the WB and loved them. I bought the album right away and have been listening ever since. Say I Am You is filled with fabulous lyrics and such an original sound...if you enjoy folk music you will want to own this album! Enjoy!
4,great new cd from weepies,i love this cd. i think its better than the last weepies I bought. worth owning.
5,Best Album,"I'm not much of a folk song fan, but the weepies' albums is something you cannot ignore.i gotta day, it's the best =)"
3,Memory Foam?,"The product makes it sound like this is really soft and the picture shows a hand with indented foam. This mouse pad is pretty hard. The part for your wrist is not very soft.If you want a firm pad...this will be good for you. But if you are wanting a soft place to wrest your wrist ""foam"" is a bit mis-leading.Overall it is a good pad, but for my I prefer very soft pads like gel pads."
5,Very nice,"Soft, supports my wrist perfectly. Exactly what I needed.Bottom is very sticky, doesn't leave any residue or anything like that, but when you want to move it you have to pretty much peel it off from where it was first stuck. Not complaining, just saying."
4,The cushion for my wrist is somehow a little hard for me,"I have been using it for a couple of hours, and I am not feeling bad except that the cushion is too high for me. I think maybe it will get down some time later. Actually it's good! The price is a little bit lower than the same product in the market."
5,The return of Disco Music @ CIRCUS DISCO Night Club,"Gino Soccio has some of the great music to dance hustle/disco to. You can now hear more of that music at Circus Disco in Hollywood, the place where it all happened. Well it's all back again and those songs of yesteryear are being played again.Can't go wrong with any Gino Soccio purchase."
4,Back to 80's,This album seems to be a clasic 80's disco dance. An excelent album which any disco's fan should be listen. Congratulations Gino!
5,Great modern an'funk music with italian style,"Gino soccio maked great music to us. He is a excellent performer musician,producer and keyboard player.Funky music with a little italian touch! Cool feel! from the '80.Listen it!!!"
2,spend more and get something better,This doesn't fit weaver rails without modifications. I don't have anything I can put it on. I guess the battery will be a backup for my bsa red dot.
4,Its okay,"Maybe its my bad adjustment or my airsoft gun, but no matter where the red dot is, the bb goes over the target. I try to adjust it, but its still the same. At a closer range(10ft), i can hit the targer most of the time. All in all its good."
2,Nothing New,"I was expecting more in-depth information on running injuries, but this booked contained less information than a lot of other general running books.For example this morning I referenced the book on hamstring injuries, and the only information they had on hamstrings was on stretching.Very disappointed in the content."
1,injury prevention,Not very helpful if you have an injury. Very basic information. I have been a runner for 28 years and there is nothing helpful in this book that you can't get anywhere else for free.
3,Basic,"My second foray into the Runner's World series on running was another good yet overly basic, and generalized plan to running effectively without injury over the long term. It begs the question: do we really need another one of these types of guides? The author touches briefly on some special populations such as youth and women. She profiles a number of common running injuries and the usual course of treatment. There are also a number of basic exercise and stretching routines with illustrations to benefit runners. Finally, the importance of choosing the right shoe and staying open to the possible need to change shoe type over time is stressed abundantly throughout the book. This is really a book for beginner runners. Clearly, a seasoned runner should not find a thing in this book that has not already been realized. Those looking for more in depth information on running injuries should look elsewhere."
2,Didn't learn anything from this book.,"I am pretty disappointed with this. It's mostly common sense, and if you're not a total newbie, you could have written it yourself."
3,A powerhouse of a book,"I never read Haley until now and I am sorry it has taken so long.The story starts off like an after school special but, suddenly picks up speed and turns into an amazing novel.Haley has a way of just giving enough to spark your imagination. I thought about this book for a long time. I guess what I got out of it was how each of us can over come our percieved ideas and become better people."
4,Amazing Insight,"Alex Haley probes the depths of the Southern mindset of the times with regard to the horrific prejudice Whites had against Blacks. Slave owners regarded their slaves as less than human, yet loved them and depended upon them when they kept their place. The social and spiritual awakening of Fletcher Randall, a prominent slave owner's son, is an amazing story. The Quaker influence on this young man's thinking is rightfully and skillfully acknowledged as he commits himself to being an agent for the Underground Railroad with a challenging assignment. My only regret is that the ending felt abrupt to me, leaving me wishing for more details about the outcome over the Christmas holidays. Perhaps Mr. Haley is wise in letting the reader use his/her own imagination about that."
3,Johnny Depp Star Biography,Interesting. Good pictures. Would be great if the book were in color instead of black and white.
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!,It was a complete sham! They only sent us one bar of the ladder rack. Called the company to make it right and send out another bar to make a complete ladder rack and they would not work with us at all!
4,"""SPAGHETTTI"" WESTERN","Italian western. Release April 19, 1968.Starring Richard Harrison II, Claudio Camaso and Spela Rozin.A man tracks down 5 men who murdered his brother Richie, all the while being followed by a mysterious Pinkerton Detective.Gold, betrayal, and vengeance.Lots of action. Lots of small cigars and smoky saloons.I had heard that Charles Bronson saw this one and wanted to do a remake. Too bad he didn't.Good to watch."
3,It's not realy best from Van McCoy,"I was looking for Van McCoy's CD for years. Yesterday I accidentally found this one in HMV. I purchased it without hesitation for HK[money] (about US[money]) - too expensive.I like Van McCoy. I owned many vinyl albums 20 years ago. I am disappointed with this CD because some of his famous songs like ""Get Dancing"" and ""African Symphony"" cannot be found in this CD. Instead, it includes some not so hit songs (in my opinion) like ""Boogie Down"" and ""Shuffle"".The CD includes a Hustle Remix (track 1), but I prefer the original mix (track 14).I am still finding Van McCoy's CD like ""Disco Baby"" from Van McCoy and The Soul City Symphony. And a CD version of the vinyl album titled ""Magnificent"" or something with the word ""Magnificent"" (with a chain machine printed on the vinyl album cover).AW"
4,KEEP ON HUSTLIN,I UST TO LISTEN TO VAN MCCOY IN 86 WHENI WS 6 HIS MUSIC CONTINES TO INSPIRE THE DEEP SOUTH IN MY SOUL.
4,The Best Ever,"The young son of Mike McCoy has struck gold with this record. It is amazing that before the age of 1 he has written and performed such classics. It is also amazing that he wrote and performed them over 20 years before his birth. Way to go Mr. McCoy, that child will some day be the next Lord of The Dag."
3,"Van McCoy, the second best man named van ever.","second to van morrison. But here's the weird part, Mr. Mike McCoy is from Morrison Illinois, as far as I know. and Van Morrison, is a singer. and so is Van Mccoy. i wonder if there is anyone named mike morrison, from mccoy. that would be weird.to be honest, i havent' listened to this, i just wanted to review it. i guess if you are a fan, there's probably a better collection out there. if you arn't, then don't buy it."
5,DISCO ISN'T DEAD!,"If you like disco or just like to wear platform shoes and a leasure suit, this CD is for you! ALL of the classics that even the younger generation will love (I am 19 and I LOVE IT)! Will have any Disco Baby DANCING under the Disco Ball!"
4,the 70's disco,"i guess this is the one that started it all or KC & the sunshine band ?great times & full of fun. shaft, pam grier (my big crush), etc. nice beat & memories. enjoy.********"
5,...A Truly Fabulous...,"and classy CD is this one here. I only knew 3 Songs before, obviously the Hustle, The Shuffle (still probably one of my all time favorite songs ever) and Soul Cha Cha. Besides the Super Hustle Mix (Song Nbr 1) of The Hustle, they are all original recordings and thanks to digitally remastering they sound superb! If you only know Van McCoy because of the Hustle and if you love it as much as i do, then go ahead and buy this CD, you won't regret it and *Keep On Hustlin'"" :-)"
5,a genius,the grooves never died from this genius.The Hustle was one of his many classics.his arragements are incredible.a fun classic disc.
5,Great light,I use these behind clear lenses in rear of my R1150R motorcycle as brake lights/turn signals with a Kisan Signalminder. They are as bright as the stock bulbs and don't produce any of the heat. Behind clear lenses they look great - highly recommended.Note: These do match the picture with the two surface mount LED's on the sides. There is another version of this same light using three regular LED's instead which adds additional length.
3,Deluxe Rectangular Table & Chair Cover,After 1 year it ripped from wind. Was disappointed I thought it was suppose to last longer then a year......
2,DElux Rectangular Table & chair cover,"Hi, I am some what disappointed with this product as I was under the impression that it was a water proof cover when to my surprise all the cushions on the chairs were very wet and now damaged on further investigation every thing under the cover was wet.It does say it's water resistant but I guess its how U interpret resistant!!."
3,Somewhat satisfied,"We are somewhat satisfied with this table and chair set cover. It fits fairly well over our rectangular table and six chairs. We wish there were more ties or some other way to secure the cover to the table and chairs. On a windy day, the cover was being blown up, causing a sail effect. We were very pleased with the price of the cover."
3,Didn't last.,"We purchased this in November of 2009. It lasted 2 winters, then got brittle and died during the 3rd winter. We live in Southern California, so there is no freezing, and we store it in the garage during the warm weather months. We only used it to protect our patio set from the rain. Very disappointed that it gave out so soon."
1,Cheap!,This cover is made of cheap material and ripped after only one winter! I would not purchase this brand again.
1,cover review,"Product lasted less than one year. We live in Broomfield Colorado and have had a very mild winter so far. We have seen ~ 10 "" of snow total so far and no more than 5 "" in any storm. This cover decayed and fell apart already(7 months old). Definitely not worth the money. A large sheet of denim would have been a better purchase."
1,Very low quality,"The manufacturer's description starts, ""Protect your outdoor items from winter's wrath...""I would not know; this product did not make it to its first winter. The material is very thin & fragile and tore within a few months during a rain storm, even though it was well secured and there was nothing sharp under it (e.g., an umbrella) to create a weak spot.Look elsewhere if you want something that will hold up."
1,Lasted 6 months,"It tears quite easily, the material tends to brittle with time, it sticks to the table when it rains, and overall it ruined our table more than protecting it. Highly not recommended."
5,Another Amazon Great Buy!,"I picked this up as an after thought when we bought our patio furniture. It was less expensive than the ones I had seen in store and although there were no reviews yet I decided to take a chance and I am so glad I did. This cover met and exceeded my expectations. We have a rectangle 4 chair set with 4 additional folding chairs and side table and this covers it all! We take the folding chairs and lay them on the table, put the side table underneath the larger one and the cover fits over nicely with a good amount of extra room. It also has 4 tie downs to keep it from flying away. All in all I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase one. After all we spend on our patio furniture it only makes sense to keep them covered when necessary to extend their lifespan."
1,TOTAL JUNK: DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Bought this in May and it was ripping in August. Total junk, after it sits out in the rain if you put your finger on it, your finger will go right threw it. I was so disappointed I should have just covered my patio with a blanket, I would have been better off."
2,not for outside use!,"If you live on top of a hill where 40-50 mph arctic blasts blow through your town over the course of a long winter, guess what? This Rectangular Table & Chair Set Cover will rip and tear VERY easily. In a matter of days even. Maybe if you live in southern California or Arizona such a cover is considered reliable, but here in southeast Pennsylvania with wind being a constant nuisance? Yeah, this thing is useless. Also, too much rain will make it rot, especially if the water is sitting in the middle of it for an extended period of time. Always make sure you drain the water after a rainstorm. Oh, and in case someone says ""This is intended for summer weather"" guess what? Wind occurs frequently in the summer too -not to mention heavy downpours from intense lightning storms- so it doesn't work THAT time of year either. It's just a bad product. Don't buy it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this cover because of the claim that it was heavy duty. Unfortunately, it's anything but. The cover is big enough to cover our entire set, but that's the only positive thing I can say. After exposure to the sun for a couple of months, the material has become brittle and has formed multiple cracks and rips at the points where the cover contacts the patio set. It's probably fine if you want to use it indoors, but I would not recommend exposing it to the elements."
1,Very Low quality product,"I bought the product in May 16, 2009. It claims that its made of heavy material, it resist craking, tearing, etc... Sure it does all that if its protected from snow, rain, wind, heat, cold. Basicaly, its good item for indoor use and NOT for OUTDOOR. So I contacted AMAZON for replacement, and been told the warranty is only for 2 months which was expired in July 5, 2009.Return Window expired on July 5, 2009/// [...] \\\Advise: Find you another better quality product."
2,Not so good after a year,"Bought this almost a year ago, and it was good for a year, but now it's all rotten and its breaking down. We're going to have to get a new one. Most probably from the store where we bought the outdoor furniture set."
5,Outdoor Table and Chair cover,I am very very pleased with this product. The quality is excellent and it fits my table and chairs correctly. It also has ties to keep in down during a storm. I also bought a separate chair cover and am very pleased with that as well.The ordering and delivery were easy and quick. I have purchased from amazon in the past and will continue to do so. I recommend them to anyone.
3,"Good start, fails to finish","I bought this in February 2009. The reviews looked good, so I took a chance.The cover lasted a few months and then started to get brittle. Not long after, it began tearing at every opportunity. The UV resistant duct tape used to patch the tears lasted longer than the fabric of the cover.I was initially impressed with the weight of the fabric, construction, etc. But, this cover did not last a full season."
2,not so bad if you don't mind replacing every 6 months...,"It seems like a nice cover. It's large enough to cover my big patio table and six chairs. It has ties on the four corners to tie it to the table or chairs to keep from blowing away, although the ties are difficult to tie around anything because they aren't very long and something with a buckle or clasp would be easier.The biggest problem is that it falls apart and tears after about 4-6 months. I've had to purchase 4 of these in the past two years. Maybe it happens because I'm down in Florida and it can't take the heat... After it sits in the sun for a while, it rains and the water puddles and the material tears under the weight. I think the material is not thick enough. I finally found another brand with more durable material that is big enough, has clasps to secure it to the table legs, and is only a few dollars more expensive so I'm done with this cover."
5,Deluxe rectangular table and chair set cover,"The item above purchased came perfectly wrapped and easily opened. I am pleased with the material of the canvas due to gale winds, I am confident knowing my furniture will be fully protected this winter. The size of the product is quite large which enables me to store other furniture pieces with the main set as well. I would highly recommend this canvas to anyone in need of winter outdoor storage."
4,Good Quality for Price,"Overall seems very durable but time will tell. Make sure you measure your table and chairs. This product was much larger than I expected. But would buy again for the price.Update: As others have mentioned, this cover ripped in about a year. I live in Los Angeles and the weather is fairly mild. Not much rain and definitely not much snow. It's big enough that I can move the rip to still cover the furniture, but it's somewhat tacky looking now."
2,mistaken,"I thought I was purchasing a CD describing the road along the way to Hana (Maui). Instead, the CD was music having nothing to do with the area."
2,"not the ""Maui's Best Cassette Guide"", but I have that, too!","Dee, your review amused me, because I DO have the audio cassette ""Road to Hana"" (side 1) and ""Haleakala Crater, Iao Valley"" (side 2)! It is c. 1996 from the Activity Information Center. I have not played it, but it is said to be a very good drive-guide on the road to Hana. As to this cassette (Lift) we are supposed to be reviewing, well, I think I'd rather listen to the drive-guide & play some other music along the way. P.S. Dee -- if you want the cassette I have, it can be arranged!"
3,An Encyclopedia for US History,"While the quality of the book seems good, the organization is unusual for a history book. It should be emphasized that this is a reference book set up like an encyclopedia on people, battles, and wars (listed alphabetically). It is NOT set up chronologically!"
2,Not impressed with this lamp.,"It looks like a great deal since its marked at such an incredible discount. Sadly, its not so great. While it looks good, its flimsy."
2,One Word,"the one word that came to my mind when i finish this book was, ""huh?"" I mean i got it was about finding yourself and friendship, but come on. that was the strangest and most confusing ending ever. it didnt even finish the story."
5,It was worth every penny I spent,"I love this product. I clean my hard wood floor every once a week and vinyl sheet. It did an awesome job. Some review said that the wet vacuum doesn't work very well. Mine did, I just go slowly and the result is very dry. So I am happy with this product."
2,Waste of Money,"I am so disappointed with this machine. I bought it thinking it would be convenient not having to bring out the mop and pail BUT this is heavy and a pain to use.It also doesn't work all that well for me, I find it doesn't clean as well and I can get the floor MUCH cleaner using the mop and pail.I am selling it and returning to the good 'ol fashioned method. I had high hopes."
4,Great little machine!,"I purchased this floor cleaner because I found it difficult to use standard mops and the throw-away kind didn't get the floor clean! This is easy to use and cleans very well. It missed five stars simply because it doesn't have a set of brushes for heavy scrubbing; however, going over the floor twice achieved the desired result."
2,Doesn't really scrub very well,"This machine doesn't really quite work right. Yes, things spin around and water gets sucked up, but it really doesn't work the way you wished it would work. After it has been used for awhile things work less like you expect them to work ... yes, it's better than by hand."
2,An over-priced wet/dry vac,"We recently bought a home with a lot of ceramic floor tile, so I bought this item last January, paying around $250 for it. I am disappointed with both the quality and performance of this machine.The Hoover cleaner that it supposedly requires is expensive and not readily available. Save your money and use either Armstrong Floor Cleaner or NON sudsy ammonia. The detergent container locks securely about 30% of the time; requires multiple tries (read:spills) to make it stay on. The wand cracked after 1 use. The hose connection, like the detergent cup, does not latch securely, rendering the small tools ineffective, since the cleaner cannot be dispensed or removed. Neither the floor nor grout brush (mounted on the upright unit) is effective in cleaning the grout in between tiles.If your floor is very lightly soiled, it may work just fine. The best thing I can say about this machine is that at least you aren't using dirty buckets of water to clean your floors!"
2,Just not that great.,"We have owned the 800 for about a year now. I am unsatisfied with its performance.My biggest complaint: the reservoirs are much too small. I don't have that much floor that needs mopping, and yet I have to stop repeatedly to empty the dirty water and put clean water in. A point in its favor, adding water and dumping the dirty water is pretty easy.My next problem is with the plunger in the dirty water reservoir. This is what stops the suction when the container is full. The problem is that jostling will caused the plunger to set even though it isn't full yet. You have to turn off the unit to fit this. It is very annoying.I've actually went back to regular mops, and have experimented with using my carpet cleaner vac instead. It seems to work much better, and its reservoir is huge, no unnecessary stopping.I'm actually surprised this thing is getting as high a reviews as it is."
3,Cool but short-lived,"I loved it at first, it certainly does what it says it will do. But the top tank empties fast and the bottom fills fast. Very soon began mopping separately and using this to suck up water. That was best use for us.I used it only a limited number of times before it was parked in closet for a while. (I had surgery and spouse refuses to use new-fangled contraptions.) Got it out recently and it won't work. Just stopped suctioning. Cleaned it out every which way. Probably used all of 15 times total. Two years old, so warranty gone. Final analysis: a little too frail for the money."
4,It's great!,"I received my Floormate yesterday and it's great! It was easy to assemble and easy to use! I'm so happy to get rid of brooms and mops! The only reason that it got 4 stars is that I found it to be a bit heavy. I'm a petite girl and I found it a bit heavy, but other than that, it's perfect!"
5,I LOVE IT,"I have a big house all tile throughout; plus 3 dogs and two cats. I like keeping my floors really clean (kinda contradicting for a person with 5 animals!); however, this product, I LOVE. I have had other Floormate versions, but this one is great. Not only the noozle is bigger, but the cord is longer and the caddy works, although I really never use it.It is a wonderful product, a little bit loud, but picks up all the animals hairs, and all dirt with the dry setting. I LOVE IT!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"This product takes twice as long as a regular vaccum and mop. I felt that by the time a did a dry vaccum, wash floor, dry floor, and then clean the unit. I could have long been done the old way. Not good enough to get yet. Good idea, still needs work."
1,I hate it!,We live on a ranch and have pets in the house. This machine does not have enough suction for tile or hardwood floors. I used it twice and it sits in the pantry unused. I would gladly sell it if anyone wants one!
2,One Year 2 Months/Light Duty/Gone In A Puff of Black Smoke,"This is an okay ""light duty"" unit, not even close to commercial grade. It was fair in cleaning kitchen and basement floors. I would not say great or even good but it was fairly easy to use and did really help with clean up of pet ""accidents"" for a no touch clean. Still, I used the unit maybe twice a month tops, now 1 year and 2 months (making it 2 months out of warranty) a puff of black smoke, a blown circuit breaker and a very dead FloorMate, so it goes."
4,Exactly what I expected,"My Hoover H3060 Floormate arrived exactly the day they said it would. Very well packaged, even came w/ some unexpected samples so I was able to start on the cleaning right away. Does the basic cleaning, my water was almost black, however it does not scrub in the grooves of heavy textured tile. Overall does a much better job then just a mop."
1,Not for me...,"Read most of the reviews before buying this, thought I could live with most of the downsides, but found otherwise. I found the dry vac mode too weak to pick up all of the debis. I had to sweep up small stuff that really should have been drawn in the vac. Also found the unit tough to turn becuase the back wheels seemed to prevent (rather than enable) a good swivel action.Next, I tried the wet scrubbing mode and was surprised at how hard the unit was to push once it sucked against the floor (vinyl). In vac mode it was easy to push forward and back but in scrubbing mode it was MUCH harder to push.Other drawbacks were - finding a storage place for this large unit; it is heavy; dragging the electric cord around.Given the cost, effort to prepare the machine, operate and store this unit, I found I prefer my broom and mop after all."
4,why would anyone scrub floors again!?,"this machine can scrub and clean your hard floor surfaces, and I wonder why anyone would mop or scrub a floor again!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought the FloorMate for my wife... she was complaining of back pain for having to sweep and mop the floors. We live at the street level so our floors need to be cleaned regularly... a lot of street dust accumulates easily. I was skeptic at first... but decided to try it myself. I ended up cleaning the whole floor myself.This vacuum did the job and was easy to clean after finished. My only complaint would be that the water reservoir is quite small, so I had to refill twice. I like in a small 700 sqf apartmet... so if you live in a bigger place... be ready to refill at least 4 -5 times every time you clean your floors. Aside from that minor issue... this product is worth the investment."
4,It really helped me,"I have reconstructive knee surgery and was talking to a co-worker who recommended the floor mate. It was so much faster than the old ways I washed the floor and safer for me. My floors are beautiful. I did call Hoover's customer service, because sometimes I have issues putting things together, and they were very helpful. If I couldn't fix my problem, they would have given me a local dealer to take the product to. I didn't need to do this, but it's still a nice touch."
4,Love It!,"This floor cleaner is great! It's easy (and fun) to use, and it leaves a dry floor behind. I have tiled floors in most of the house, and the machine does streak slightly, but less so than other methods of mopping. I would recommend it to others."
3,Hoover Floormate Deluxe,"The product is a step above the original Floormate, but just one step. It was shipped promptly and I would do business with this seller again."
5,Love my Floormate,"I just got this machine and I love it. It has two sets of brushes, one of which I used on my wood floor, the other on my rougher tile. It cleaned beautifully and clean up of the machine was a breeze."
2,"Great Dry Vac, but Terrible Wet Vac","I have owned the H3060 now for several months and the dry pickup is great and the unit moves easily across our tile floors (our entire home is tile). But under the wet vac mode it is extremely difficult to push across the floor. They really need to install a ""power assist"" under this wet vac mode if you are going to get through your whole house. For small jobs it is probably OK, but definitely not for an entire home."
4,No comparison,I purchased this floor cleaner a few months ago and I'm very happy with the result I see after I clean my floors. It's stays clean longer and the shine speaks for itself. I recommend this product to everyone that likes neat beautiful clean floors.
1,Not Impressed,"At first I really liked this product, however after 4 or 5 uses I started having problems. 1) you have to empty the tank alot 2) the unit stopped picking up the water consistently 3) if you use the vacumn feature the dirt gets wet and clogges up the tubes. Great idea but alot of design flaws."
1,Still Not Working,"A few days after receiving my FloorMate, I put it together. It took about 2 hours to assemble. I tried to use it to pick up the loose debris on the floor before attempting the wash function. It picked up less than my Swifter and seemed to blow things all over and I got VERY frustrated. My husband tried it and determined it was defective or something was loose. He called Hoover and they said to bring it to a service center. The alternative was disassembling and packing it to return to Amazon, a daunting prospect right before Christmas. I just got it back last week and still have not tried it. At this point it is too late to return to Amazon and I hope it works. There is nothing worse than a vacuum that blows dirt all over the floor. I will hold my breath and try it next week, almost two months after purchasing it. I am not a happy camper and probably will not buy another Hoover product."
4,Hoover hard floor cleaner,"Our home has mostly tile floors. Mops are inefficient and hands-and-knees scrubbing with rags is just too difficult. I'd love to find a true steam cleaner that would really clean the floor and pick up the water, but they just don't exist. The Hoover is a decent vacuum, and it will actually do some scrubbing and then leave the floor comparatively dry. It still takes some effort and it won't save you a lot of time, but it does get you off your knees. A mop just seems to smear the dirt around and not really pick it up. I can walk barefoot on my floors after using the Hoover, and it really does feel cleaner. The tool caddy is kind of an abomination and not very well designed, but it works. I'm still looking for a good steam cleaner, but this will suffice until I find one."
2,Should have waited...,"I'm going to give this machine 2 stars because the alternative of scrubbing with a mop is worse.That being said, this machine is easy to assemble and it's directions are clear.I use this machine on sealed wood floors in my dining room and kitchen. It is easy to use, however, no matter what I tried, I could not get the floors clean without streaking. I used less water, more water, moved it ever so slowly, agonizingly so in fact. To no avail.The machine does get the floor clean but if I want a shiny floor I have to add an extra step and use a mop with a polish to remove the streaks. And the whole process takes three times as long to do as the back-breaking mop method.So since I've had poor performance from Hoover vacuums, I should have known better and just waited for Dyson to demonstrate the right way to build one of these machines.Others may have had a better experience with tile floors, however my experience on wood floors is abysmal."
1,doesn't last very long,"The machine does what it says, it scrubs all kinds of floors and sucks up the water, but the motor goes bad quickly, in fact mine stopped working after less than a year, and I've had two 500 models burn out within a year also, so much as I liked how well it cleaned my floors, I'm going back to a tried and true mop.Bottom line, not worth the cost, motor doesn't last, easily burns out."
1,I hope that I get it back in the box,"Very disappointed. More work than mopping my laminate floors. I guess I was hoping for a miracle. Plus every time I turned it off, it started leaking badly. Now I have to try to put it back in the box for shipping. Forgot to take pics of what it looked like before I took it out.Save yourself time and money. This is not working."
4,Hoover FloorMate H3060,I love using a hard floor cleaner versus a mop. There is no comparison. You are putting clean water on the floor rather then using the same dirty water over and over and cleaning out the mop over and over. The only negative to this product is that it is a little heavy. It does work good though.
4,Really nice,"This really really cleans floors very well and dries them nicely. The vacuum feature worked fine for me! It doesn't get behind toilets, I was thinking that I could get it back there somehow, but the tools work okay. I use a scrubbing sponge to get the edges. This cleans the floor so well you could eat on them, and I have big stinky dogs. Before using this, you could still see the dirt on the floor, but this cleaned them up great with ease. I'm thinking of firing the cleaners after using this product. It's so easy to use, fun to use, and cleans the floors so well."
3,Good vacuum,"Pros:1. It does a great job on tile floors. Much easier than a regular mop and it seems to get up more dirt. It does my kitchen floor very quickly and the floor really does seem clean afterward.Cons:1. It does not do a great job on tough dirt spots but I think those require a hand scrubbing anyway.2. I've noticed that it leaves streaks on the wood floors but I'm trying to figure out if it's something I'm doing wrong.3. The attachments are more trouble than they are worth. Although they do clean in tight spots, it's a pain to clean the hose and attachments at the end. I've concluded that it is just easier to get those small spots by hand verses having to spend the time at the end cleaning the attachments.Overall, I would buy this machine again. It's the best thing out there in my opinion. And I can't say enough about how well it cleans tile foors."
1,MACHINE DOES NOT SUCK AND TOTALLY BLOWS,"I purchases a Hoover H3060 FloorMate SpinScrub 800 Hard Floor Cleaner with Portable Detail Kit. I was not only disappointed, I was fairly disgusted.The dirt from the vacuum feature and the floor cleaning feature all end up in the same tank. It is so disgusting to clean. There are nooks and crannies that will not rinse out. The vacuum feature only works for a short time, and then you have to take out the filter and clean it. It was such a G-d-awful mess to clean, that I can't imagine why anyone would go to all this time and all this trouble, rather than just use a mop.Even returning it was a pain. Once the upper handle is snapped into place, it cannot be undone. I verified this by calling Hoover.So that meant that the box it came in would not fit it for the return.I did manage to get another box and shipped it back. Goodbye and good riddance."
3,Floormate Review,"I purchased the Hover Floormate to use on my tile floors. At first I was thinking I had made a big mistake, not to worry, because it could go back. I used it the second time and I liked it a lot better. Cleaning in the bathrooms was really great! I used the attachments around the baseboards and around the commodes. Worked really well. My floors seemed cleaner to me. I didn't have to get my hands messy. The little debris that normally flies around when you sweep no longer flies around while cleaning the floors. That means less dusting! If I could improve or add something, it would be a brush with longer bristles on the scrubber. My tile is not even and I need something to get in the groves."
5,I'm over the mop,"My husband bought this for me after using my mop. I have extremely arthritic hands and wringing a mop put me out of commission for the rest of the day. I have 1900 sq ft of tile and this machine works great. It's easy to use and even the trigger doesn't hurt my hands. I couldn't believe how dirty the water was and I had just mopped the floors. We live on 3 acres and have a dog,cat, and birds and grandkidlets. I'll never be without this machine again. Cleaning the machine is easy as well. The only down side is the small tank but that's not that big of a hassle. It vaccuums well and cleans the water up easily. It's easy to push also. I read the reviews and did the research and this is the best buy he ever made."
1,"STINKS, wait til you need service","Doesn't clean worth beans, it fell apart. I called customer service, on hold for over 40 minutes, then told ""SORRY"" they are in a conversion, customers aren't important, I can take it to Montreal Canada for service!!! This thing is less than 6 months old, I live in MAINE!!! Warranty? There is NONE! They were SO RUDE, so uncaring. I will NEVER buy a Hoover product again."
5,My hardwoods never looked like this...,"I've been cleaning my hardwood floors with the recommended mop for four years. One time with the FloorMate and they shine like the day they were refinished. A week after the floors were cleaned, a realtor told me she had never seen hardwoods that look as good as mine. In the kitchen I could never remove the gray from my white linoleum. One attack with the FloorMate and the linoleum is also as white as new. I can't recommend this highly enough!"
3,Doesnt clean grout,Easy to use but isnt powerful enough to properly clean dirty grout. Even when switching to the grout brush and using the hoover grout clean chemicals. Tiles are nice and clean but grout is still dirty.
4,Money or Time Saver...........Works for Me,Before purchasing the floor mate. I was a swiffer user. And a happy one. However the cost of swiffer products can run high. When one uses them five days aweeks. We just laid new tile floor in 2/3's of our house. So I started looking into floor vac's for hard floors. Upon checking out the floor mate. I learned I wanted the Hover Floor-Mate 800...It seemed to do it all. And it does. Having the hose use as well helps to get around the toilet. We also tiled the shower walls. The floor-mate cleans the walls effortlessly. I did my homework and shopped around for the best pricing. Which was found at Amazon..saved on the shipping as well as the total cost of the floor-mate..I'm now able to get a drity job done with ;ittle effort and very little cost.
3,An OK floor cleaner,I have used this cleaner for 2 years and it is good for large area jobs. The brushes have one speed and intensity and that makes for an average performance on a really dirty floor and it is too harsh on my wood floors. It requires refilling and emptying the tanks and then cleaning the brushes after each job. This machine leaves a puddle of dirty water when left standing every so often. It takes up a lot of space in my utility room and I would have been better just buying a Hoover carpet steam cleaner that has spin & scrub brushes. I just tried that out and it works just as well on my linoleum floor.
2,Maybe we got a defective unit,We had this for over a year. It worked just fine until one day when I was cleaning it caught on fire.
4,Happy in AZ,"I was in desperate need of clean tile floors! I chose this product based on product reviews and comparison shopping - there isn't anything else out there to scrub tile floors. My tile floors were filthy and I could not keep up with weekly mopping. There are 2 adults, 2 pre-teens, 1 dog, and 3 cats. We live in the AZ country - which means we have a lot of dust and dirt that gets tracked into the house. We have about 1500 sq ft of coarse tile and unsealed grout. Although this product isn't the greatest ever - it keeps me from having to hand scrub or killing my back and arms from scrubbing with a mop. I was also pleasantly surprised that the hoover cleaning products work just s well as/better than Pine-sol, Clorox bleach, and Mr. clean. The hoover grout cleaner works the best on the tile and grout - just can't find it in any local stores! The only thing I don't like about this product is that I wish the brushes were harder - so they would clean more into the tile and grout."
1,I got old used Vaccum Cleaner while I paid for brand new,"I got Hoover FloorMate Spinscrub 800 Wet/Dry Vacuum cleaner which had tale-tale signs of being used in the past without its original packing or box. When I called customer service at Amazon, I was informed that product has been discontinued. I was given a refund of $40. This experience has shaken my confidence in online purchase. When I paid for a brand new item, there cannot be any reason for Amazon to send me a used product."
5,This Thing Works,"We live out in the country in a house with about 2400"" feet of laminate floors, a tile mud-room, and four dogs. It's not easy to keep these floors clean. Previous to purchasing this Hover SpinScrub, I would broom sweep, vacuum with the Dyson All Floors, and then hand mop. Now I can simply do my sweeping and finish with the Hoover. It gets the floors clean and really does pick up the dirty water efficiently. My only gripe is that the two water tanks (clean and dirty) could be bigger ...to eliminate multiple refill and empty cycles. I have only used it once so far, but it works as advertised."
4,Does the Job!,I think this product works great with one exception. The only problem I have with the machine is that it leaks a little water back onto the floor after it is turned off. It cleans great and is very easy to use. I think that it is well worth the money.
3,Not bad...,"Cleans well, but does not have much suction to dry vacuum or pickup leftover moisture. Pricy for the performance. Stick with the Swiffer WetJet, works just well."
2,Works about as well as a mop,This works but isn't any better at cleaning than a simple mop. It also isn't any less work than a simple mop. Not worth the money.
4,A Bit Better Than My First One,"Floormate works OK but still needs better downward scrubbing presure. I'm not happy that it is Chinese built and will buy American at every opportunity. Corporate globalization is a sad thing for average Americans. I guess that Ross Perots' ""giant sucking sound"" was right on the money. I hope this changes before the world becomes a slave to the super rich. Anyway, this machine is fair, and better than a mop. It could be much better. The fluid tanks should be larger also. The scrubbing pressure could be cured by some springs between the brushes and the case."
2,it's a really LOUSY dry vacuum,"It is bad vacuume for Dry floor. If we spend money for a Vaccum cleaner, we expect that it should do atleast the basic work, that is vacuum the dry floor quick and best. Washing comes next. But this is a very lousy dry vacuum. It pushes the dust away rather socking. I think the claim of dry vacuum should be taken away. For Washing and wet socking is good, but not good for dry vacuum."
1,Save your money and buy a Scooba instead,"I purchased 2 of these when they first came out. I gave one to my mother. Within about a year they both stopped working. They easily become clogged and try as I might, I just couldn't return the suction to any level. It just pushed dirty water around the floor. I contacted Hoover and they could care less. So I threw them both out. Total waste of money.I have since purchased 2 iRobot Scoobas and they have been outstanding for over a year and a half. Not only do they clean better than this piece of junk ever did, they are completely automatic. set it up, come back in 45 minutes and the floor is clean and dry! All the areas can be easily cleaned so you never wind up with the situation that happened with the floormate. Also, it takes up less than 1/10th the storage space.Do yourself a big favor, before you invest in a Floormate, checkout the Scooba.No, I don't work for iRobot. I just hate being ripped off like I was with the Floormate!"
4,The only way to clean your floors,"The floormate is fantastic. You never put dirty water back on the floor.When you see the filth this thing picks up, you'll be amazed.The caveat is that it is so good, you have to constantly clean out every place it sucks up dirt. It can clog easily if you have pet dander or long hair all around. You must also empty the reservoir after each use or it will stink up your home.The absolute best way to use this is in conjunction with a swiffer and an electric broom. First, sweep the floor with an electric or regular broom/dust pan. Then, use the swiffer if you have the time.After you've removed any ""large"" items from the floor, cleaning with the floormate will be a breeze and you will have less debris clogging it up.You don't necessarily have to sweep/swiffer first, but it's wise since you'll have less maintanence on the floormate when you're done.Use the Floormate once a week and your floors will sparkle."
4,Floormate,I had the old floormate model 3000 for 2 years..But the switch that controls the wash and dry vacuum would get stuck..and finally the vaccuum wouldn't dry up the foor or wet it. I bought the new 800 floormate and they redid the switch..made it a knob..which I think is better. The new floormate seems to work alot better..the base is a lot wider..and the attachments make it easiler to get into tight spaces like behind tables..The only thing is the cord gets in the way while cleaning..Otherwise it's great for tile floors.
4,hoover floormate,"Works as designed. Only clitch is the anti spiphon valve in the return cannister prematurely closes down, stoppping suction. I weighted the valve and that corrected the problem somewhat."
3,Pretty good cleaning,"I have had a previous spinscrub, and I bought this new model. It is a fast way with minimal muscle to get a clean floor. This particular model doesn't have as much brush contact with the floor as my last one, which I kind of miss. Some other drawbacks is that it doesn't make the floor really shiny, and the scrubber can be too wide to get into small places, or under cabinets, etc. The pluses are that it is fast, it cleans thoroughly and is pretty convenient to use."
1,Not The Greatest Invention,I bought this for our small office with linolium tile floors. The unit is not heavy enough or have stiff enough scrubbing bristles to be very effective. After trying several times and going very slow unit would not clean drip spots or scuff marks. A good old fashion mop did a much better job. Unit would probably be good for only mildly dirty floors. Vacuum feature would pick small light items such as loose dirt or dog hair but not a small leaf. I am packing up item for a return and see if there is anything heavy duty on the market at a reasonable price.
5,Floors Made Easy,"We have lots of ceramic tile. My wife used to use extra large sponge mops and became frustrated when looking for replacement heads, both locating and replacing. I inherited this chore from her, and I tried Swiffer Wet Jets. They went bad after about 18 months, and you buy another. My wife complained about the smell. They did not do grout, and the grout required on-your-knees work with chemicals and tools, and it looked bad in places. With both of these methods, the floor was wet afterwards.With the Hoover H3060, it does it all. It scrubs tile and grout, and picks-up the liquid from the floor too. The tile floors look great and the grout is clean too without getting on-your-knees."
2,Poor performance.,"I set it up by the manual, but the performance was poor. It does not pick up the powder and water as easy. It would be better to use a mop."
5,I didn't know how dirty my floors were,"I am another person who took a trial run with the Hoover and almost threw up when I saw the dirty water in the tank. That reinforced our need for this product! The key definitely seems to be going back and forth slowly. And, make sure you clean all of the parts after every use! They get really disgusting, but they are fairly easy to clean just by running them under hot water. I use ammonia as my cleaning solution -- it's cheap and effective, and unlike other products, it does not leave any kind of a sticky or waxy film.The only cons: like others, I think the grout brush attachment is pretty much worthless. Also, if I stop using it for a few minutes, it will leak some water droplets on the floor, but I just wipe them up with a towel after I'm done."
4,Hoover 3060- Great for Floors!,"I have used all of the floormates from the first they came out with. The $99 range one is not recommended!! They tear up easily, as I went thru 2 of those in a year before getting this model. The design is much improved, it will scrub, then dry(great suction) your floors in no time. I would NEVER go back to a filthy mop again(even though i would mop, rinse & remop over & over!)This or the model just below(have it too, without the attachment)are great!"
4,Beats being on your hands and knees,"I bought this unit about a year ago. Believe it does a pretty good job. Observations. I don't use the Hoover cleaning fluid. I use Fabulosa, Lysol or Spic & Span. Use only a 1/2 of the measuring device or the floor will be sticky. Yeah the tanks are small but not that much of a pain to fill or empty. My biggest gripe was that the two plastic levers holding the brush cover would constantly work loose. After about 9 months of this infuriating problem I decided to fix it. Drilled two small holes through the levers and then two smaller starter holes into the base. Attached retaining screws and problem solved. Wish I had thought of it sooner."
1,"HP Everyday Photo Paper, Matte",I was expecting a much heavier paper than what I received. This product is only 1 step above regular copy paper. I do not recommend this.
2,I never thought paper could be so confusing!,"I received this product on time and promptly went to go try it out, much to my dismay... it felt like normal printer paper! And even though it is ""matte"" finish, I cannot tell which side to print on! Both sides look the same, so I took two pieces and tried printing the same picture on both sides, well, it looks streaky on either side.I guess this product is ok for the price, and fine for pictures you don't much care about, but its a little disappointing to hang up a streaky picture."
1,Just a little thicker than normal,"This paper is not good for photographs. It is simple a plain white paper that is just a bit thicker than regular paper. There is no coating to help hold the ink, and it is so thin that there will always be thumbnail dents in your photographs if you handel them even a little. It would be good for flyers, but not photographs."
3,not as expected,"This photo paper is like a heavy copy paper, does not have any type of gloss or finish. It is ok if you don't want a real photo looking picture. I didn't know that everyday photo paper was just that, a heavier copy paper and when it said matte I thought it was a low sheen finish, not a no finish. If you want a real photo look get a different paper."
5,HP Everyday Photo Matte paper,"Excellent product for regular color printing demands, especially on HP printers. This stock eliminates the glare that is associated with glossy paper."
2,Adventures in photo paper,"I purchased HP Everyday Photo Paper, matte (100 sheets, 8.5 x 11-inch) for use in printing a calendar for family members for Christmas. I had tried to get the paper I usually used at Sams and found only glossy paper which doesn't work very well for calendars. The HP was a disappointment compared to Royal Brite paper that I have used before. It was adequate but not heavy enough to produce a really professional looking calendar. I tried to find the other brand at Amazon but it wasn't available. I'll keep looking."
2,COUD BE MISTAKEN FOR COPY PAPER,"I expected to receive photo paper that was a heavier stock than standard copy paper, but that is what I got. My first impression was that an error was made when ""picking"" the order but the packaging indicated that it was indeed photo paper. I am definately disappointed with the quality that I received."
2,Eh.....not what I was looking for......,"I'm sure this paper is great in it's own special way, but it was TOTALLY not what I was looking for. The vision in my head of matte photo paper was of what I used when I was developing pics from 35mm negatives...this stuff seems more like thin poster board, or perhaps thick notebook paper. I suppose I should have done more research before hastily finishing my transaction, but I can't help but be upset...especially since the shipping was only $2 less than the product itself. So if you're looking to frame a photo or do a quality print to keep around for a while, I suggest paying the extra cash for some premium photo paper."
5,My favorite paper,"This is my favorite ""everyday"" paper. I use it for all my high volume color photo printing, such as photo albums and calendars. When a high gloss print is not needed, this is an excellent paper choice. It produces well saturated color prints at a low cost. I'm not using an HP printer, either."
1,not good,I will never recomend this paper to anyone it sucks!!! the paper is realy thin & is no better then regular paper NOT good 4 photos at all I was disapointed
5,Excellent Book,"I picked up this book because I liked ""Psalms of my Life"" and I had just lost a friend due to a drunk driving accident. The author, in this book, seems to graple with the enormity of loss. From those who die as children, those who die as teenagers, and those who are quickly taken as my friend was.This book offers help & hope. It helps a person understand the feelings they are feeling and drives you into the loving arms of God who understands you best of all.This author knows about what he speaks after losing three of his sons to death. A very very very good book."
1,Dead as a doornail after 12 months,"Just after the warranty runs out, this battery dies completely. Can't take a charge and will only run on AC. I guess you get what you pay for"
5,Worked for me,Battery fit into my T41P snag and nice. It lasted for about 110 min after first charge playing YouTube video non-stop. Can't comment on longevity used it only for a few weeks
1,"Do not buy this replacement battery, period","I just bought one, received, tried, it suddenly died after using for one hour without any AC on. This is the same problem mentioned in some of reviews. When such a problem persists, no one should buy it, period. I am returning the item."
2,Not a perfect fit,"Used with IBM Thinkpad T43. Model 1871-xxxit fits, but BARELY. It is slightly bigger and the edges do not fit flush.battery life about >2 hrs with light internet surfing."
5,Low cost perfect preformer,"I purchased this battery to replace a toasted T41 battery. I am surprised at the life I get out of my T41 running Ubuntu 9.04.With other laptops I usually keep my power supply close by for when my battery dies abruptly (i.e. it says 10 minutes and the next moment ""I am shutting down messages"").This battery has been running great. I have not had the sudden power drops like described above. 10 minutes is 10 minutes give or take. It fit perfect and has run flawless to date. An easy choice for anyone needing a replacement on a T41 (T2374151)."
1,Battery dies with in 1 week of usage,"I bought this as a replacement for my OEM battery. To my surprise this battery dies with in a week. I got it as new from Amazon listing, not sure if they cheated me. But the end result is waste of money and time. No more items from this seller for sure."
5,As soon as I received it worked perfectly!,As soon as I received it worked perfectly for a friend of mine's Thinkpad T40. I was needing this part to repair it. No problem at all.
4,T40 Battery,"Functioning fine so far. Your 20 requirement for writing this review is ridiculous. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
3,You get what you pay for - update,"I have contacted the seller, so this review will change based of the response. I bought this battery with low expectation, but I expected it to last longer than a month. It worked fine at first and then it just stopped charging. Seeing how my laptop was an older one I just dismissed the short run time as a product as old technology, but now I realize it was probably a defective product. I am hoping the seller will work something out with me, but time will tell.Update:The seller contacted me and offered me a refund or replacement. I am improving this review just because he/she was prompt and professional."
5,Very Pleased with my Amazon purchase,I received the new battery for my PC in short time and at a very reasonable price that I could not beat anywhere else on the internet.
2,Only lasts 50 minutes,I got this battery because my current battery only lasted about 40 minutes. This one is not much better ... about 50 minutes. I don't use laptops much and mine is an older IBM ThinkPad r52 but the specs say 217 minutes and 3:30 (hh:mm). So this battery in my mind was a waste of money. I only gave it a decent rating because the transaction and delivery were smooth and timely.
2,IBM R50 No More,"All,Re: Chicken or Egg ResultWell my IBM original equipment AC adaptor and battery had reached their end of life so orderd a new ac adaptorand battery and for about two weeks all was good. Then I started to have power supply issues - fluttering and Windows would not load up. Well within 30 days the IBM R50 was no longer responding to new AC adaptor or battery.So was it the new power items I just bought or a another laptop power supply issue? Had technician look at R50 but based on age and speed not sure worth the cost/analysis.John"
2,Sometimes computer sleeps at 88%,"Problems:1. Sometimes (not always), the computer says 'you should charge your battery' and then goes to sleep when the battery still has more than 80% capacity (after about 20 min use). Maybe the output voltage is not stable.2. I set 'begin charging when below 80% and stop at 90%'. But it always fully charges. Something must be wrong with it.My previous (original) battery never had the two problems.Capacity: Standard 6-cell. Battery life: About 2 hours which is OK.Fit: Not perfect, but OK.All in all, my experience is slightly negative."
1,Thieves,"After less than six months battery failed. Try to get these guys to honor their warranty mission impossible, they have no contact information (even through Amazon) and their phone from the Internet doesn't work. These guys are NOT honorable don't buy anything from them and Amazon damages its reputation with vendors like these. Please have them removed"
1,BATTERY SCAM *BEWARE*,This battery worked great for about a month (just enough time so I couldn't return it) and now it drains almost as quickly as the battery I've had for five years. Do not purchase!!!
5,Excellent item,"Promptly received battery, no shipping damages noted. Fully charged battery and have been getting 3 to 4 hours use of a fully charged battery. Would buy again & recommend it to friends."
4,Works Good,"Was a good price, and gives me enough time to do most tasks. Can't go crazy on it processing-wise and expect too much - but it works good."
4,Accutire safety kit,"This product was on sale at a good price. The tire gauge seems accurate, the flashlight is small, but bright, and the multitool seems adequate for the sale price. The case seems sturdy, and keeps everything together. Should fit in even a small glove compartment."
2,Don't waste your money,I thought this would be a good tool kit but I'm so not impressed by the cheapness of the product. The tire pressure gauge is PLASTIC. And I found it a bit hard to get a reading. I'm so glad I kept my old fashioned metal gauge because it works accurately every time.
2,"There were some good ideas, but untimately disappointing","Kim Stanley Robinson is one of those writers who gets better with time. Icehenge is interesting in places -- but it didn't work for me. There just is not enough meat there to make a book. The book is written in three parts, each separated by 50 years or so; and the parts just don't work together very well. Now, perhaps that was the point...but that point could have been made better...and it's a pretty damn small point to make in a book of this scale.His Mars books (especially the first one) are spectactular. This one...well...not."
4,An excellet book for sci-fi fans,"The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because his Mars Triology is better. Icehenge has the same in depth character development as the rest of KSR's work and also has an intriguing plot, although the novel slows up a little in the middle. The book is told from the point of view of three people over the course of hundreds of different years, and is an enjoyable read just for its setting, but the enigma behind the plot (which is revealed in the end) is incredible.If you like sci-fi, and especially if you're a KSR fan, this is the book for you!"
3,"suddenly, it all makes sense","this is more of a furutist novel than about this thing icehenge. Robinson seems to make an attempt at a probable future, he examines what an interplanetary society would be like. People in this book live 700 years because of genetic treatments, that is handeled well too. By the way, this is the only book in which you'll read someone described as ""an attractive, hundredish woman."""
2,A puzzle,"I didn't get this book. It was somewhat interesting, but at the end, I didn't know why it was written. If you want to read KSR from this time period, read the Three Californias trilogy, they're 4-star books."
4,Cool Book about a Cold Construct,A good story about an impossible construct leads the main characters to search for the meaning behind it and the people that placed it there.An easy and speedy readnot at the same level of most of his other books
4,Really FOUR and a HALF .,"This is one of Robinson`s best earlier works. Icehenge has a good story with memorable characters and events that lead to a good ending. Some what predictable at time, neverless a good read that I would recommend to any Sci-Fi fan. Check out Short, Sharp Shock next."
2,gripping,I am not a science fiction fan and this book didn't make me one. I found it to be a bit too mysterious for me but the first section was rather gripping. Perhaps I just need to watch a lot more episodes of Star Treck to get the hang of it.
5,Who built Icehenge?,"This is a fantastic book by an excellent author. Icehenge gives you the journals of three individuals all somehow connected with a mysterious monolith on Pluto. This is a suspenceful story that keeps you asking ""Who built Icehenge?"" to the very last page."
3,Too Slick!,"OK now, this may be a bit picky but...I returned the book because the slick paper and all the pictures got in the way of accessing content. I love pictures & color but it was all too much!The gutters and margins were also just too small.I did enjoy the PBS special but found the books difficult to access."
5,One of the great books,"This book is not only informative, but entertaining. The drawings are a hoot. The humor along with the information made this book a good read. It was uplifting. I found myself smiling while I was reading. I highly recommend reading this book cover to cover."
4,Great Book,This is a great book for people with health concerns. No matter what your issue having a healthy gut will help your overall wellness. It's easy to read and to understand.This book helped me to trace the origins of my health problems and it got me wondering just which malady started first.
5,Very well organized and well written,Covers a lot of different topics but some are related. I have found it to be pretty spot on.
3,Great Resource: Risk Texts Do not Age Well However,"This is an excellent work on reputational risk and definitely worth obtaining. It is a real shame, however, that there is not a more recent edition. The risk landscape has changed dramatically and a book on risk from 2003 is akin to a book on the Windows operating system from 2003 - significantly less valuable as time goes on."
5,Awesome,"If u don't have this in your collection.... You're collection ain't complete. This is an all time classic. ""Stop, Look & Listen, You Are Everything, If I Love You and People Make The World Go Round"" are definite timeless classics. Get this."
5,The Beginning,"My first experience of The Stylistics was this ""album"". My cousin ruined it by warping. I've since purchased another album and once again enjoy the unique style of the beginning for the Stylistics. I really like all these songs even ""Country Living""."
5,"A contrast to ""EEEEEEWWWWWW!""","Yeah, I'm the the writer of that review. And I didn't see the pics here. I saw the picture of him on myscene.com(HE'S CROSSEYED!) Now I think he's not all that bad..."
1,These my scene guys needs some SERIOUS help!!!!!!!!!,"Its bad enough that that the my scene in general looks ugly but the guys look like who did it and ran! If you think the my scene guys look good then you got a problem. At least the bratz boyz look SO MUCH better than these my scenes. These my scene boys need more than BEYOND help. Im not saying that you have to listen to me but I think bratz are so much better than my scenes. They have nice hot clothing that isnt tacky and even though they have big lips at least there not like my scene dolls that has sloppy butt shapped lips. I really recommend bratz instead of these squishy headed, butt sloppy lipped, ugly dolls, with tacky clothes called my scene. God, Please help the people who makes these dolls...seriously..."
3,Entertaining,"Having spent a month in India, and experiencing first-hand Indian roads and traffic, I found Days & Nights on The Grand Trunk Road to be as entertaining as a travelogue on the Travel Channel...no more no less. Some errors intersperse the book, but are of little consequence to its overall flow. However, Weller should be aware that Muslims normally perform ablutions five times a day, preceding each set of prayers. The Pakistani fellow who advised him otherwise was grossly misinformed."
3,They're great for storage but kinda of a pain for feeding,"These bottles are great for storage, I like that the tops twist tight for a no leak seal, but they are a pain to feed from. The attachments make the bottle so big! And I don't like that there is only one adapter with the set, I was constantly sterilizing it and finally gave up and just used the Avent bottles."
4,Avent's only BPA Free bottle!!,"I love this product because they are the only Avent ""bottle"" that are BPA free!! I love the Avent nipples since they are more natural shaped and my son switches from breast to these easily. I refuse to use any of Avents regular bottles since they are very high in BPA. So these are great! I can pump directly into them and then attach the nipple and not have to worry about poisoning my son. I wish they had more BPA free bottles that are not disposable but I am just happy they at least have these."
3,just okay,"I bought this product with the hopes of making the whole process easier. It is great that you can pump directly into the pre sterilized cup, put a lid on it, label it then put it away for future use. If you are going to use it soon and just put it in the fridge it works great. I have not had any problems with it leaking. My biggest complaint is that it takes about 45 minutes to defrost the frozen milk in the cup. If you know that you will need it ahead of time, you can put it in the fridge overnight to defrost which is the best thing to do. But for me, I usually don't know that far ahead if I will need a bottle, so I am going back to the freezer bags. Hope this helps in your decision!"
1,worthless,"this item never worked,and trying to contact the supplier is hopeless because they don't exist,an amazon is of no help either.Sorry i ever bought it"
1,Too graphic !!,"I bought this book for my six year old son, and I was horrified by the way the book began to change about mid-way through.The details of death and destruction are much too mature for young children, and the illustrations go as far as to show the dead bodies of people and animals lying in the wake of the twister!! I had even flipped through the book before purchasing it but was still unaware of some of the violent images until I read through the entire book. So if you intend to buy this online where you cannot check every page beforehand......beware!"
4,Krishna Biased rendering,"Although this book is indeed a great read, I think it should be fully warned that this book is written by a Krishna Priest, and therefore far more Krishna oriented than e.g the beautiful rendering by William Buck and the great full translation began by Van Buitenen. I too believe that Krishna is a reincarnation of God, but I'm afraid the story doesn't get better by augmenting this point at every possibility."
1,Wrong Premise for the book,"It looks like an ISCON version of Mahabharata. I am saddened that it is rewritten as 'the narration of the factual events which surrounded the speaking of that illuminating text [Bhagavadgita]'. The epic was created, told/retold in various phases. It is a well accepted fact by scholars that Bhagavadgita was added way later in the formation of the epic. It is most definitely not written around Gita. Mahabharat is a masterpiece of an epic that beautifully develops characters in shades of grey, not black and white. Portraying it as evil vs. good and as a fancy cover to Gita is horribly misleading."
5,Very entertaining and fast-paced read,"Unexpectedly entertaining for a literary read like the Mahabharata. The casual tone helps a casual reader like me to understand the story, the people and the events without having to read too much detail."
3,Are you new to the mahabharata?,If you are new to the Hindu classics or dont have the time or attention span to read a 1600 page book then this is for you. You will get the basics and I mean basics of the mahabharata.If you are a advanced student of the Hindu epics this book simply will not do. It is way to short and so much critical info is left out that you come away with only a skeliton of the text. Also this kind of reads like a star wars type tale the way its done by him. I would recommend Dharma's longer version if you like a westernized stream of thought or ramesh menon's Mahabharata is a more complete yet easy to read version. But this book cant be discounted out of hand becouse it is intended for the causual reader.
3,"Good book, bad writing","I started reading William Buck's Mahabharata, and it was so engrossing that I had to read this one as well. Buck's is simply too short and this version promised to include more of the story and also seemed to be more faithful to the language of the original. Unfortuantely, it has none of Buck's charm. The language is unrelentingly flat and dull. The translator has a tin ear and the writing is simply bad. College students have more variety in their diction and sentence structure than Mr. Kenneth Anderson, aka Krishna Dharma. I can only hope that I find another version that is accurate, and long enough, but at the same time doesn't put you to sleep. Reading this can be simply exhausting."
2,some suggestions,"The finest condensation of the Mahabharata, both thematically and stylistically, is by P.Lal (publishers: Vikas, New Delhi)an eminent poet and transcreator of Indian literature. Other excellent insights and creative pieces can be found in ""Vyasa's Mahabharata: Creative Insights"" in 2 volumes (Writers Workshop, Calcutta)"
2,Only a thin slice of the pie...,"Krishna Dharma's version of what is indeed the world's greatest epic, is only skin deep. in fact, the best way to describe it, is only going to the shallow end of the pool.while translating the whole text seems next to impossible, i agree that abridged versions are marketable. and while Dharma's attractive book cover makes it seem like you are delving into a deep saga, that draws you in so that you become addicted to the"
1,Very bad book.,"This book is probably the worst translation of the original epic. The book is totally biased to reflect the writers views rather than presenting the original text. The language is not clear and the editor has done a pretty ordinary job. Also, the writer exaggerates the events blowing them out of proportion. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Was great - now can't record video only audio,"We had this camera for about 1.5 years before it konked out. We can now only record audio. Every blue moon we'll get video for about a minute before it goes black. My husband works in the film industry and this camera was meant to be used at home for the kiddos and he spent hours researching video equipment before he bought this product. I can't stand spending money fixing a camera that was $400 and from the looks of other reviewers, I won't be calling Sony for customer support."
2,My SONY Camcorder quit for no reason,"I had the same thing happen with my SONY DCR-TRV19 after exactly one year. So I called the Sony support number. After holding for 45 minutes they told me my warrenty was 12 months parts, 90 days labor. They were nice enought to wave the parts seeing it is a few days past a year but they want $219 for labor!!!!!If you search the web this is a common problem with the SONY DCR-TVR19 / DCR-TRV22 / DCR-TRV33.I realy wish I'd bought a JVC. They are rated beter and less expensive. I do know that's the last Sony product I'm going to buy. 90 day warrenty for $500 dollar product is terrible.Mine doesn't have a single scratch and has NEVER been dropped.This years models are:DCR-HC20 / DCR-HC30 GARBAGE DCR-HC65 / DCR-HC85 CHEAPJUNKIt appears the first to use the same 680k CCD. A likely culprit for this problem.Check your warrenties.JUNK JUNK JUNKMike Grimm, IL."
1,CAMCORDER GIVES FALSE MESSAGE OF LENS COVER BEING CLOSED,"WE ONLY USED THIS CAMERA THREE TIMES....BOUGHT IT EXACLTY 3 YEARS AGO AND I TRIED TO USE IT THE OTHER DAY AND THE SCREEN APPEARS BLACK & A MESSAGE APPEARS SAYING ""LENS COVER IS CLOSED"" - WHICH IS NOT TRUE.IT ONLY RECORDS AUDIO NOW AND YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT YOU ARE RECORDING - USELESS! FROM READING THE OTHER REVIEWS I REALIZE THAT SEVERAL OF US HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT - IT IS OBVIOULSY POORLY MANUFACTURED. WE HAD JUST PURCHASED A NEW BATTERY TOO BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS COMPLETELY DEAD."
4,Very Good Camera but HOPELESS software,"I so agree with ""brucex"", the person/s who designed this software should really be given life imprisonment...oh my god its just useless.You cant copy raw video to PC but the picture package creates its own Video with its own effects and sounds...What Good is that...I just want my video as it is...For that the online HELP tells me you shud use a Third Party software..ahhhhBut the Camcorder MINUS software is just great....Its very easy to understand and use...The touchscreen feature is fabulous and light/sound clarity is wonderful.This cute camcorder definitely deserves 5 but the BAD software takes point away.I wish Sony could come up with easier and better software for HC-20 and replace our CDs."
3,camcorder,"I haven't really used the camera yet. The batteries are not keeping a charge but the camera will serve it's purpose and that is to transfer my tapes to DVD. I had to purchase a cord because it didn't come with one. When I asked the seller a question about the product after delivery, I never got a response."
2,Did its job until it broke down,"I bought this camcorder for its blend of feature and good value for price. I used it mainly for auto track days, recording video from a suction mount and it performed adequately, returning good image and sound quality and acceptable battery life. Features like the microphone input jack and the IR remote control were precious in that usage model.Unfortunately, the camcorder stopped working abruptly after 3 years of light and careful use, camera still functional but no image. So much for Sony's reputation for quality and reliability."
1,NOt upto expectation,I owned Sony analog camcorder for long time. Recently I bought this one for digital storage and compact size.I am suprised to see very poor quality video compare to my old analog camcorder. video is really dark and not worth taking in home(Even on bright day). I continue use old analog camcorder for family video.
3,So so effort,"Camera is light weight and has plenty of functions, however, the softward to burn the tape to CDR or edit the tape is terrible. Basically, I can only hook up the camera to the TV to watch the video."
1,"fine camcorder, terrible customer service","After receiving this camcorder, which is fine, I read a lot of reviews about the poor battery camera. I was especially concerned about reviews of the battery lasting only 8 minutes.So, I contacted Sony asking if the issue had been resolved or if there are any proactive steps I could take to stem the issue. I got nothing but the runaround and never a straight answer. I eventually returned the camcorder for another brand.I never had the chance to extensively use the camcorder, but I did tape about 10 minutes and it seemed fine and easy to use.However, I would be leary about a company that will not stand behind a product nor give a consumer a straight answer.Bottom line: fine enough camcorder and terrible customer service. I find it extremely unlikely I will ever purchase another Sony product again."
2,"Like the Camera, but not SONY. Beware of Battery Drain","I purchased the HC-40 about 4 months ago. It is a very nice compact camera, great quality pics/videos. However, I too have battery drain problems. Camera won't charge batteries, and the ones I charge in the optional charger I bought are dead within a day (when left in the camera and the camera is turned off). Sony refuses to acknowledge that they are aware of the problem and they say I have to pay $216 for labor since I am past the 3 month labor warranty. Again a nice camera, too bad it is made by a company who won't stand behind their product. Either buy the extended warranty, or sock away an extra $216 for repair, or just save yourself the headache and BUY ANOTHER CAMERA.UPDATE. Sony has waived the $216 repair costs. Still you may wish to consider buying the extended warranty when your buy this camera."
4,Received this camcorder yesterday.,"This camcorder is very small, light and cute. I tested it in my apartment in regular light. The picture was a little bit grainy, but not too much. Would llke to read comments of other people that have used this camcorder about low-light performance. The other issue I see is that you can make still pictures on the Mini-DV tape. However, the camera then records a 7-second sound byte, and there's no way to turn off that 7-second delay. That does not make any sense. Also, the balck-and-white viewfinder is not very good. If you want to be really happy, pay $100 extra and buy DCR-HC30. However, in terms of battery life and weight, this one comes out on top and is probably sufficient for most users. I assume that most people want to have more control over still images anyway and would buy a digital camera in order to make good digital photos.Overall, this is a very nice product, as you'd expect from Sony."
3,"Good ""value"" kettle for home brewing","It's a good size and shape for home brewing, but not a very heavy gauge steel. It weighs about 6 lbs. and has a ""brushed"" finish like you see in a stainless steel sink as opposed to shiny like silverware. The dimensions in the product description are inaccurate; it's approx. 13.5"" wide x 13"" tall (not counting the lid).If you're looking to economize, this is a good choice. I'm sure it will work fine. If you can spare a little more, I'd go with something heavier gauge."
4,Stock pot,"Good stock pot. It's construction is of high quality. The metal is thin, but this aids in rapid heat transfer into the pan. Not a lot of heat is lost to heating the pan. This is doubly helpful when you have to rapidly chill the wort for beer making, the pot won't retain lots of heat. Ideal for beer making."
3,Stainless stock pot.,"Stainless stock pot was pretty much what I expected, not quite as thick and sturdy as I would have liked, but then I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. It will do the job for a while, maybe a long while, we shall see."
5,Perfect for 5 gallon beer brewing,I bought this large stock pot and a 5 gallon beer brewing set for my hubbie for our anniversary. It's the perfect size for it and I will also be using it for canning veggies later on in the season. LOVE how large this pot is!
2,Old School Retailing,"The international market has had much change since the release of this book. The markets have evolved and business model have changed.Additionally for Todays market, It lacks- Concepts of Item Classification- Clearing Customs- Basic Marketing for local markets- E-tailing"
5,True to Life,"I have been a fan of Baby Blues since my daughter was born, eight years ago. I sometimes think that Mr. Kirkman and Mr. Scott hide outside my windows and take notes, because so many of their strips are right on the mark! If you have small children, are thinking about having small children, or just want a god belly laugh, I highly recommend the entire series of Baby Blues collections. Enjoy!"
3,I found this a bit tiresome,This is one of the older Agatha's and feels a bit dated. One of the only ones I didn't read twice. For real fans worth a read.
2,Falls between two chairs,"If ""The Secret of Chimneys"" was supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny enough; and if it was supposed to be a thriller, it's not tense and dramatic and mysterious enough. I'm not sure whether to attribute its problems to lack of skill on Agatha Christie's part or the expectations of the time it was written, though I lean towards the former.Basically, Anthony Cade jumps at the opportunity to involve himself in the convoluted goings-on surrounding the political future of an imaginary Balkans kingdom, saving the day with good old English pluck amongst a succession of silly characters and foreseeable plot ""twists"". Tommy Beresford works as a character, Anthony Cade doesn't. It's a very personal thriller, with mighty events hanging upon the actions of one man; perhaps an attractive idea in the 1920s, but one that doesn't sit well these days.A curiosity more than anything else."
2,Concerning the AudioBook CD Edition,"This comment specifically concerns the AudioBook CD edition read by Hugh Fraser. As an avid audiobook listener, I would like to post a comment about this edition:Fraser is not the most versatile voice-doer I've listened to, and that can be distracting at times. There is little change in pause length between sentence and paragraphs. Also, until you get used to the subtle difference in tones and voices, it is very hard to follow in dialogue who's saying what (especially when there are more than two characters conversing), and very easy for your mind to wander off, victim to the monotonous reading style. Overall, I give the reading effort 3 out of 5 stars.Whether you should purchase this or not is up to you, but at least you've been cautioned. I recently heard The Body in the Library, read by Stephanie Cole, and the quality of the reading was excellent. Happy listening!"
3,Good but not memorable,"Agatha Christie's usual skill is evident here, but for some reason this book failed to interest me as much as other books by this author. Maybe the setting just didn't appeal to me personally. The characters are engaging, but I felt the romance overshadowed the mystery, so that when I finished the book I could hardly remember what it was about."
5,Puritanism at its warmest and best!,"Do you need encouraging in times of difficulty? This book is for you. Do you need strengthening in your walk with the LORD? This book is for you. Do you need help in everyday living? This book is for you. This book in fact brings to every person great encouragement in the opening up of Romans 8 verse 28. How does the LORD make sin and evil and persecution, and life and death and every other thing work together for good? This little book explains how so simply and gently that you just want to dance and sing for joy. One of my top five books ever- if not the joint top with Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Buy and read. Buy and praise Him."
1,Don't even bother!!!!,"I am a huge Bobby Brown fan. Only in my early 20s, I virtually grew up on his songs. His earlier CD's were among my first in my CD collection. What a disappointment this CD was. Don't even bother considering this poor excuse for a CD. Did they even TRY to put out something good???"
1,WTF??,"Why did he release this?His last 2 albums Bobby & Don't Be Cruel were really good. For some idiotic reason known only to Bobby he has dropped the writers & producers Babyface & Teddy Riley who gave him all his solo hits.Instead he has decided to produce half the album himself. B-List producers Tim & Bob did produce a couple of tracks on the album, they are well known for Sisqo's ""Thong Song"" and their work with Bobby Valentino. All other creative personnel are pretty much unknown.I have tried over a number of years dusting this CD off and giving it another spin but the music is generic and boring.I don't know why he thought he could be the creative force behind this instead of using proven hit makers like Babyface & Teddy Riley, possibly ego. Well he's paid the price because not only is this his worst album but it was a massive flop."
2,Not as bad as King Of Stage But Not Good Enoungh,"Like his first solo album, the only good thing about this album are the slow jams in particular She's My Lady, Forever & My Place. Bobby ego's got the best of him on this album and it shows."
1,Ya heard!,Word has it that Bobby's back in the studio recording..somebody's gotta stop the making of the album...NOW!No offence Bob..but its time for u to quit!
3,Sound?,"Is the video part suppose to have sound? This is a gift order that hasnt come in yet, and im already hearing complaints. I just want to know what Im getting into.Thanks!"
5,SURPRISE !!!,IT WAS GIVEN AS A GIFT. SHE TAKES PICS OF HER 6 DOGS 4 CATS AND BIRDS ALL FROM SHELTERS IN UPSTATE NY. TAKES HER PICS AND E-MAILS THEM TO FAMILY & FRIENDS. WHAT AN UNEXPECTED BIRTHDAY GIFT.
4,Very nice camera for price,"I was looking for a small, good, easy to use camera and I found it with this Kodak EasyShare C300.If I had one complaint, it is that I wanted something a bit more compact, and this camera is not compact, it is a pretty fat, and weighty camera.I used it right out of the box. It came with rechargable batteries and I bought the docking station so the camera and recharge. And it recharges quickly.I am impressed by the ease of use of the camera. Without even opening the instruction book I figured out the menu easily.The software is nice and easy to use. Camera really is easy to share."
4,Very good starter camera,"We purchased 2 of these cameras for our young kids as their first digital cameras. Our kids have enjoyed snapping lots of pictures and movies, especially since this camera is easy to use. Our seven year olds quickly learned what all the buttons do and the pictures have come out very good for the price. The pictures look much better on the computer than they do on the LCD display on the camera. Rechargeable batteries are a must."
4,Kodak Easy Share 3.2 mega pixels,"We've loved this digital camera; I'm still learning how to use all the features, but it's very user friendly and the I couldn't beat the price!"
1,A Piece Of Junk!!,Horrible camera. Barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz.Drained the batteries within a few pictures.So not worth more then the cost of a disposable!! Sorry Kodak...but I'll stick with the good ol' reliable Sony.
2,"Easy to use, but...","The Kodak EasyShare C300 is a good beginner's camera I suppose. I read the reviews and saw that this camera was described as being easy to use and with good image quality, so I bought it. I was disappointed when I received my order. Though it is easy to use, the picture quality is pretty rank; horrible even. The pictures it takes outside are barely acceptable, but indoors it's just terrible. If you're looking for a budget camera, I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
5,good deal for under 100 bucks,"Takes good clear pics with nice bright colors, very simple to use, great for beginners. I feel it couldnt get any better for under $100."
1,This should be in the toy section,"This thing is so outdated it's probably pointless to even do a review of it after all these years. But maybe someone will benefit from the review if they find themselves looking for a cheap, used camera. Simply put: KEEP LOOKING because this thing produces pictures that are horribly bad. I bought it for my daughter in '05 and even by the standards of those days the pictures that came from this cam were worthless. You can get something so very much better than this for pretty cheap nowadays so don't bother with this one. A used Canon point-and-shoot with at least 6MP can be had for next to nothing. Don't buy this Kodak except as a gag gift for someone IF you can get it for less than a dollar."
1,Kodak easyshare,"Camera worked great for us for 6 months. Easy to use, decent pictures and good software. The battery life was fine for our use. It quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless. For a six month disposable camera its a little expensive."
2,Eh.,"I gave it two stars because it was great... when it worked.I got it sometime in January, and it lasted until about June.I take good care of my things, so I know its not me.It just suddenly *stopped* working.I'm more than just a little miffed.I've tried getting all different types of batteries-I've tried letting it sit for a while.I've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff.Its dead. I just threw it away."
4,Great for the price,"My sister owns this camera, and I have been very impressed. The picture quality is very good, and it has all the basics.If you need a decent camera but have a low budget, this is the one for you"
1,I thought Kodak had better Quality that THIS?!?!,"I am SO disappointed with this Camera I wish I had never bought it! I've had the Camera all of 2 months and I've taken all of 25 photos ( Half of them had to be deleted because of poor quality). And here's the kicker, now the Camera won't even work! Something internally has gone wrong! Camera and Batteries both heat up to the point where you can't hold them. Don't WASTE you're money on this POOR quality 3.2mp camera!"
2,Zoom is horrible,"I don't care if it had 100x zoom. That's not gonna matter if you cant tell what you were taking a picture of anyways. Its good for some family photos, but only if they're within 5 feet of you. The zoom function is pretty bad. Its a fun camera for a kid though. The price is just about right at about 100 dollars. It is simple to use and download off of. The zoom is just horrible though."
2,Over heats,I bought 4 of these. One for each child in my house. Two of these cameras have overheated the batteries and had to be replaced. Kodak was very good about fixing the cameras but 50% had probelms.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I've bought many items from Amazon and was a satisfied customer until now. This pathetic piece of junk is beyond entry-level. It lacks the most basic features--such as optical zoom. Although it has a digital zoom (which is less sharp and therefore inferior to optical zoom) it also lacks a separate zoom control. Instead you must use menu buttons to control the zoom. The miniscule display also makes framing shots difficult. And the camera has only three shooting modes: auto, night, and movie mode. Obviously, Kodak cut every possible corner for this rubbish. Save your money and buy something you'll actually want to use."
3,Kodak Camera,The Kodak EasyShare C300 has the basic requirements for a point and shoot digital camera. The camera lacks internal memory. You can only store about 15 pictures on the internal drive. The camera also lacks a lens cover which can cause scratches if you do not take good care of it. I would recommend buying a carrying case to avoid this problem. This requires the need to purchase a memory card right away. Another upset is it has no optical zoom. This camera is a great camera for the person who is just starting out with a digital. I think that its great for young teenagers and college students who don't have the money to spend on a more elaborate one. It is more for the casual user.For the money that it costs to purchase it is a pretty good buyCS112nka2
4,Great for Kids,I just want to say that my 2 young boys both got a camera for the old son's birthday. They love then and are having a ball. One is 7 and the other 9 years old. The camera is very strong and has taken a lot of dropping and mishandling. Young boys tend to be that way. We are very pleased.
2,Stay away from this camera,"We bought this camera 18 months ago. It takes OK pictures and is easy to use, but the body is a thin plastic. The battery hatch door on the bottom is very vulnerable to breakage. Drop the camera once and you will easily crack the door. You might think with a big company like Kodak that it would be easy to call in and get a new hatch door mailed to you. The part is worth maybe 2 cents. I tried and was told no, you have to send it in for repair - for which there is a $50 flat fee!Also - don't bother installing the Easy Share software on your PC. The Windows Picture It software is free and much simpler and faster."
5,WONDERFUL,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND HANDLE. DIGITAL PICTURE TAKING HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. THANKS SO MUCH.
4,its great,"I have a few cameras ans this one isn't the best, but it works well and is in great shape. And you can't beat it for the price!"
5,Worth Every Penny,I sent this to a friend as a gift. This is her first camera and she loves it. I have gotten pictures on both email and snail mail - all looked great.
4,"picture quality soso, sturdiness superior","I just want to add to the already available reviews: I agree with most what has been said here. Picture quality is quite below average. The same scene, just seconds apart, and you might get a different coloring in the picture (e.g. picture one is a little reddish, picture two is a little bluish). This is not too bad, though, if you just want a ""I-visited-the-Brandenburg-Gate-with-Grandma"" picture. I do use a Canon Digital Rebel XT for pictures that I want to turn out nice, but most of the times, the Kodak isn't too bad. If it is a little bad, mostly in low light conditions.However: This camera is superior in sturdiness. I have taken it everywhere. I take it skiing and I fall with it in my jacket pocket, I drop it - anything. So it will probably make it a nice camera for kids (if you can explain to them that they need to wait the 0.7 seconds until it makes the ""click"" sound). I wouldn't buy it here, though. Go to ebay, you can get one for $30 there."
1,Its Junk,A year later you can get better quality on your cell phone.No wonder Kodak is in the toilet.
1,kodak c300,This camera is great but only for a short time...have already had it repaired once and now once again it has just died on us and repairs are more expensive than new ones....do not buy this camera if you want it to last.
1,Broke before the first battery charge wore off,"I was really disappointed in this product. It worked great when I first got it. But before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working. It was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera. Like I said, disappointed."
2,not so good,"I have had this camera for about a year and a half. I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one. I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used. However, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used. I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera."
4,A Decent Textbook!,"This book is a pretty decent textbook. It's rather interesting even if your passion is not geomorphology (mine isn't) and the illustrations are useful. A great feature in this book is that after every couple of paragraphs it gives you a summary of the information contained in those paragraphs for studying. Those summaries are so well-done you could essentially read them and not the text and still get an A in the class.There is a newer version of this book, but it's almost exactly the same, so I bought this one as a value option and it was not a problem at all. I got an A in the class and the changes in the newer version were minimal and I never noticed them.The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is two-fold:#1 - too much metric and uses feet/miles only in a secondary fashion.#2 - the CD that comes with it is not worth using at all. Don't even bother installing and using the CD."
5,Stainless Steel Globe,It's round. It's green. It won't shatter if you drop it. What morecould you ask for? It's too early to see how it weathers. I mountedmine on a stiff steel wire rod through the weep-hole and from a distanceit looks like it's floating in the foilage.
2,Wrong part did fit properly,"The Beck Arnley 090-5020 Speed Sensor DID NOT FIT my 1999 Toyota Camry, 4-Cyl, Automatic Transmission. The sensor body was about 1 inch smaller (in length) that the OEM unit in the car. The shaft diameter and the center slot appeared to be the correct dimensions. You may want to check other sites to confirm that the Beck Arnley is the correct part number for your car."
4,Harman Kardon 720 earphones,"If you buy these, make sure they are inserted properly or you will not get the full effect. They must be pushed in the ear canal or they will not work properly. These are above average earphones at a decent price. You will not be disappointed with this product if you follow the instructions that are included in the package. The highs are great and the bass is tight and accurate. The Harman Kardon 720's are what you would expect at this price point. I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Very Disappointing -- Even When Free,"I too got these free from Crutchfield when I bought a pair of Infinity Speakers. At retail ~$100 I figured that they would have to have some redeeming qualities, but I have to agree with everybody else: they have no bass, and sound tinny and scratchy even when properly inserted into the ear canal. I tried both tip types to no avail. I even tried removing the filters with the supplied tool, hoping that would improve the bass; no luck. I compared these to a no-name $9 pair of iPOD-type earphones and the cheapies won hands-down. About the only good thing to say about these is that they come with an iPOD/headphones zippered case that would otherwise cost ~$15."
2,not worth the money,"i too recieved these with purchase of infinity speakers, and let me say that i'm glad i didn't pay the [...] list price that amazon shows. for a set of earbuds at that price (or any price above [...] bucks) they are horrible. the noise isolating feature does work, and they are comfortable enough, but the sound quality is lacking (again for a set of earbuds at this price point) if they were [...] bucks they would be awesome. sorry, but i'm going back to my bose earbuds, well worth the money there."
4,"Ok, but no puff","This is a nice product. It's much darker than the colors, AND doesn't come with the puff shown.You'll have to get your own. I picked the orange because I wanted coral...which what the orange is!"
1,Beware of reviews!,"There are six reviews by the same person. Seems a little fishy, huh? Let the buyer beware.I'm looking for some good SAT prep materials and have taught SAT prep classes for years. I'll steer clear of this one."
1,Ugh,"This book is a worthwhile guide to McBrien's odd biases. As a noted 'dissenter', this book should be a great comfort and resource to like-minded people.To those looking for a credible, well-written guide to Saints - those chosen by God as exemplars off heroic virtue, the book will not do at all. A few lines on great, wildly popular modern saints such as Faustina and Padre Pio? But longer disquisitions on McBrien hobbyhorses such as Albert Schweitzer. Martin Luther King, and Cardinal Bernardin? Please."
5,I felt so much better after reading this book.,"Bride's Guide helped me navigate some tough situations with friends, family and money. It made me realize that our wedding isn't just about us. It is about molding a new place in our lives as husband and wife. A wedding is a social ritual and redefines the role of parent and child. It is important to resolve problems before the wedding, lest they taint the new marriage. With the help of this book my fiance and I decided not to elope and instead we are having a small wedding, enriching our relationship and improving our relationship with friends and family."
5,Review,"Bride's Guide to Emotional Survival was amazingly helpful for me as a second time bride. All of the possible issues that I could face were covered in this book, along with ""solutions"" on how to handle each situation. This book is great whether it is your first or second marriage, or even to help you deal with daily issues that arise when two families merge together."
2,poetry,"I thought it was a book on reincarnation, stories etc, but it is a book of poetry. As I am not a keen reader of poetry I didn't read it. If you like poetry go for it."
1,Garbage,"Had this item about a year but used it only 2 or 3 times. It quit working and I couldn,t even put air in a basketball. I wouldn't suggest buying this item to anyone. The cause might be in the transformer that will overheat in minutes. To me it amounted to a piece of garbage."
1,One Time Use,"I agree with the majority. This device is almost worthless. I really expected more from a name like Motor Trend. I've had mine for about 2 yrs. Fortunately, I was able to use it once to jumpstart my car (actaully my 1st use). At that moment, I was so pleased with my purchase. I had no idea it was a one time use device. It has not recharged fully since that day. I thought about returning it but I feared the cost of shipping. I now use it to charge my cell phone and a small portable tv when the lights go out."
4,Two great Bugaloos episodes!!,"This is a great tape. Here are two classic Bugaloos episodes. The first features Sparky and Gina, plus an excellent song ""It's New to You""; and the second has Benita at her best, and includes the only Bugaloos tune released as a single, ""For a Friend""!! The only reason I give the tape only 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they'd release more episodes per tape!!"
4,THIS IS ONLY VOLUME 1 NOT 1-4,I LOVE ALL SID AND MARTY KROFT PRODUCTIONS . I GREW UP WATCHING THEM AND I'M GROWN UP AND STILL WATCHING THEM . ANY HOW THIS IS THE BUGALOOS VOLUME ONE NOT ONE TO FOUR . I TOO AM AWAITING THE DVD RELEASE . RHINO RECORDS HAS A BOX SET THAT CONTAINS ALL 17 EPISODES BUT SADLY IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE ON VHS !
4,One of the better Sid and Marty Krofts,"In most of my reviews, I do not have kind things to say about the live-action/puppet kid shows of the early 70s (the Muppet Show aside, as that was miles ahead of the pack and REAL family entertainment: Jim Henson, Si!-Sid and Marty Kroft NO!). Most of them, such as Pufnstuf, New Zoo Review, Sigmund, ad nauseum, were too childish and silly to me even when I was a child and look even worse to me now. The Bugaloos was different. This show had good songs and somewhat more clever humor that helps with the whimsical feel (isn't that a young Helen Reddy among them?). In either case, if a hardcore hater of this genre like me could recommend this after seeing it for the first time in 30+years on this set, thaen that says something. Oh yeah, it's also about time for a DVD of this."
5,hype and sooo much more!,"LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE I WONDERED IF UCB WAS ALL HYPE. I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WHILE THEIR MANAGEMENT 3P PRODUCTIONS DOES AN AMAZINGLY WELL ORCHESTRATED PR STRATEGY TO HYPE THE BAND THESE YOUNG BROTHERS ARE THE REAL DEAL. THIS CD IS LOADED WITH SOME ROCKIN' TRACKS ORIGINAL STUFF THAT THE BAND CREATED.I THEN BEGAN TO WONDER IF THIS WAS STUDIO MAGIC .NOT! THEY ARE SO EXCITING LIVE. THEY ARE THE ""PARTY BAND"" AS THEY ARE KNOWN, FOR REAL.GO GET THIS CD YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY AND CHECK THEM OUT IN PERSON. CHECK THEM OUT. PREPARE TO BE ENTERTAINED."
5,D.Cs Finest!!,"This cd is for all gogo lovers out there.I have a copy of this cd myself,I listen to it everyday.Every track on there be rockin. These young men have lots of talent.I would highly reccomend this alblum for any gogo listeners.I would like to give a shoutout to my boo tim and his men yall know who yall are!"
5,Very Pleased,"I purchased this instrument for my 11 yr old 6th grader. At first I was sure that there was going to issues with it being that the price was sooo right in comparison to spending 899.00 offered through the school. Well, the sound is great and both my son and his band instructor loves it. The case is compact and sturdy...more scratch resistant than the one he had. I would recommend to any parent to purchase as a student/beginner trumpet. I am very pleased."
1,Awful quality,"I don't have time to write reviews. But I must write a review on this instrument. Never ever buy these cheap instruments on amazon. I purcahse this instrument, thinking that I would be saving hundreds of dollars... only to have my nephew be frustrated with the instrument. Go to your local music store and purchase a quality instrument. The button on this trumpet does not slide easily...it gets stuck. And after a year of use, there is deterioation inside the instrument with rust. Please don't waste your money on this cheap instrument."
4,"Hisonic Signature Series 2110L Bb Trumpet with Case, Brass Finish","The trumpet is very nice. It arriver in a case as it should have with all that promised. the only problem i am having with this trumpet is that a valve keeps sticking. Evevn when i have oiled it the first valve closest to the mouthpiece sticks quite often. I do not know if this a common problem for this brand this does not make the trumpet unusable, just inconvenient."
1,Don't be duped by poorly made instruments,"Instruments like these result in thousands of kids losing interest in music and thinking that they are bad musicians when in fact it's the horrible instrument that is to blame.There is no way that any decent trumpet could possibly cost that little without severely sacrificing quality in the workmanship, valves and materials. When something goes wrong on an instrument like this (which it inevitably does) most repair shops won't even work on them, because they don't want to be liable for anything on an instrument that will sooner or later disintegrate. I speak from experience here.I'd avoid this and go for a seemingly more expensive but in actuality much more quality Yamaha, Bach or Getzen. You get what you pay for."
3,Fairly good beginner trumpet.,"I've been playing the trumpet for about 10+ years now, and use this trumpet primarily for rehearsal settings. It's a good beginner trumpet, and a good rehearsal trumpet, but if you have been playing the trumpet for more than 3 years, then consider getting a professional trumpet. (Even though they're much more costly) This is a fairly decent trumpet for the price. Nice finish, durable case, valves a little crammed--however a good valve oil should solve it.Can't beat it for $99!"
1,Frustrated,"My son saved his money up to purchase this trumpet. He currently plays 6 different instruments, he wants to learn as many as he can. He purchased this with the knowledge that it was a ""student"" type trumpet, not like what we get from a professional store. The trumpet comes, everything looks great, even sounds good when he plays it but the valves are sticking, which is something that happens, hence the need for valve oil. He keeps oiling it and it will continue to stick, bad. Took it to our local music store for advice and they said this was made in China, the parts are not ""stock"" and we will not work on it and it will be hard to find anyone who will. My son is extremely frustrated because the instrument looks great and sounds great, but he can not play with out stopping to wait for the valve to pop back up! My advice, get one that is not made in china so you can have it fixed if something doesn't work! If we could find someone to fix it, there would be no problems!"
2,"Decent Trumpet, for Beginners","This trumpet is great for practices and rehearsals, but it's not for everyone. If you're a new trumpet player, I'd recommend this trumpet because of it's ability to help musicians learn basics and it has an overall decent tone for a great price, but for higher level players this is NOT for you.If you've been playing for three years plus, I believe it's time you take the jump to intermediate and professional level trumpets due to there richer and bolder tones. They will cost more, but after just seconds of playing, you'll be able to hear your tone dramatically improve. That and I recommend looking for these instruments over Sam Ash or Music & Arts because of their greater selection. Before purchasing any instrument though, always test them out, you might find that you like one more then another, even if they're the same instrument brand/model type...Hope this helped :)"
3,frustrated student,"we purchased this trumpet for a child who was having trouble with a ""garage-sale"" trumpet. figured for a starter, at that price, if he decided later he wasn't interested, we weren't out a lot of money. unfortunately, the valves stick, and he plays very well, but is so upset by the trumpet that he wants to quit band, thinking he isn't any good. local music repair shop won't touch it, ""might dissolve the laquer"". so, back to square one. guess I will invest in a quality unit for a student."
1,Rip Off!!,This is nothing but a bad rip off of the Austin City Limits shows. The video quality is horrible. The song titles are not even correct of the case.
2,yawn. nothing special,"This is a mud mask ..period. It didn't work any miracles for me and as expensive as this stuff was for the amount, I was expecting the holy grail of mud masks. I think I will stick with St. Ives from now on. It was just..ordinary."
3,All you need to know about air,From tires to planes with the wonderfully detailed pictures found in real Richard Scarry Books (not those second-hand rip offs based on the very dull cartoons)
4,Very nice fit and finish.,I was unable to move my scope back far enough for optimal eye relief and searched to find extension rings made of steel (no luck) or aluminum extension rings with screws for the top ring on each side (no luck either). So I bought these. They fit perfectly on the Weaver bases and closed uniformly on the scope even with the over the top two screw design. Remember it's aluminum so tighten the screws uniformly in turn until tight. I had no problem doing this while taking my time. They hold well on a 22LR.
3,"Some nice things, but falls short","Based on the reviews, I eagerly anticipated this performance. While there are some nice moments, the performances suffer on several counts. For one thing, this recording seems to be somewhat harsh, too closely miked, and lacking in midrange/bass. On another count, while the players are individually very fine, especially the tonal contributions of Richard Young's viola, which is amazing, this is not a unified string quartet sound, in my opinion. Another example: In the Heiliger Dankgesang movement of Op. 132, which is frequently done with little vibrato (this section is a conscious evocation of earlier music), Vermeer uses none and there is no luminosity to the sound. I would recommend the Alban Berg Quartet on the Borodin Quartet over this recording."
1,Birds At Your Fingertips,"I am appalled at the bird on the ""Ponds and Lakes"" page. It is labeled a female wood duck and it is CLEARLY a Loon. I would hope others would have caught this mistake and any new editions have been corrected."
1,A very bad experience,"I received the item, it's coated to get the spectrum effect but I was looking for a CLEAR crystal (fooled by the description), even more so, the item had a chip on one edge, I contacted Gem Avenue, they told me to return it but did not cover the cost of shipping it back. I am furious that they ship defected items and are not responsible, very BAD practice, be very aware, you are on your on risk."
3,Lost Already,The ring that held it to the bracelet apparently came apart and I have lost it already. Thank goodness I did not spend much.
2,mediocrity,This book was... disappointing. I expected much more from it. For anyone with somewhat of s scientific background its not worth the money. Everything I read was good and was well written but the depth that it went into was not adequate for anyone except the layperson.
4,Great Camera....,I received this camera as a birthday gift. I love the size and the sleek design. The camera is easy to operate and takes great pictures.
4,Camera,"I have had the XThinn 864 for a few months. The quality/size of the pictures is adjustable, and at high resolution, the pictures are very nice. I added a 2gb memory card, so that it stores hundreds of pictures.The biggest drawback is that it is not very intuitive. The manual is a must. But, if you loose the manual, it is available from SVP as a download."
4,Children Having children,"This novel is about several young girls/women, around sixteen years old, with babies of their own. They are playing house of a sorts. These girls are juxtaposed with older women with very similar, yet very different problems, due to their childlessness.The book is a page-turner. It reminded me a bit of Fay Weldon. There's lots of sex, insanity and other hot items."
4,"Whoa people, THIS IS THE REMIX single!","Ignore the track listing provided by Amazon because the UPC number of 7-1518-73122-27 belongs the the 8 mix maxi cd single and not the 2 track cd single. I arrived at this page using the above UPC number but again, that number belongs to the Maxi cd single."
3,A tale of two captains,"Captain Dani Forrest heads the Boadicea, a ship in the Explora Command's Minority Fleet, where all gay and lesbian personnel are placed. Her crew is suffering from a mysterious malady when they're called on to investigate a potential act of war. Captain Bajana Ki's ship Heaven's Bow is from a different interstellar alliance and is on a mission to find the planet of their origin. The two ships become trapped by pirates and must get over their hostilities to work together. It's a great story, not unlike James Alan Gardner's ""Expendable"" series with Festina Ramos, and I did enjoy it for the most part. I felt that the story was quite weighty though. There are so many plots going on (that I didn't mention above) that three-fourths of the way through the novel I felt it would never ever end. Just when I thought things would be resolved, something else popped up. It did seem a bit much, but I still did enjoy the book overall and would read a sequel."
4,Finally! An intelligently written lesbian novel!,"I had given up on lesbian fiction - tired of the same old story line: Girl becomes involved with another woman. Girl realizes she's a lesbian. Girl has fabulous sex! Girl comes out to friends and family. Girl goes through tough times. Girl works through it and is happy! (And, of course, some obligatory ho-hum erotica thrown in for good measure.)Cognate is so NOT that. It's intelligently written (sometimes the author shows off a bit too much with her vocabulary), and even though the characters in the story just happen to be gay, that's not the point! Ironic, isn't it, how a sci-fi novel (not my usual genre, mind you) can be so much like real life! Yes! We're gay! But that's not the point! Many thanks to Womens Work Press for giving us some lesbian fiction with self-respect and integrity."
1,Gauge Failed after minimal use.,"I bought this product two years ago to check the pressure in my motorhome tires. It appeared to be a rugged, quality product which I thought would work well. Unfortunately, I was mistaken, and wish I would have never purchased it. Due to its construction, it is very hard to use on dual rear wheel tires to obtain an accurate reading. The bleed valve which I thought was a clever idea, never worked properly, and if you overfill a tire and have to release pressure, I still had to do it the old way. The gauge started leaking air where the weaved metal hose attaches to the handle, and is now useless. I would not recommend this product due to its poor design and quality."
1,Stopped working after a year,"Mediocre tire gauge that quit working after 1 year. Replaced the batteries to no effect. Will attempt to return it to this company, but from other posts, it looks like nothing will happen as they seem unresponsive."
4,Works on my Dodge.,"I got the tire gauge just in time to travel. As some of the other posts stated, the hose leaks when bent. I emailed the mfg and after no response, re-sent it with a bit stronger message...got an answer very quickly and a new hose. The only things I don't like about it is it reads upside down the way I use it (not a big problem) and the display could stay on a tad longer. This wand works better than my previous gauge due to the angle. I have to remove the wheel covers and remove an aftermarket TPMS, so maybe that is why the wand works on my Dodge. I wouldn't want to have paid more for this thing but I'm happy with it so far."
4,great,"good gauge for working on DEF systems, had to modify the tire coupler to a air line fitting but expected that"
1,Accutire RV pressure tire guage,"Purchase this unit one year ago..Looks nice, but hard to use on a RV motorhome...After one year of use the stainless steel connecting tube has developed a Leak making it unusable...Just try and find the company that made this guage to get a repair or even a refund...Accutire does not exist?"
4,Good guage,Not sure I like the bleeder.... Almost seems to sensitive even bending the hose will read .5 psi...
3,Mixed Bag,"The quality of this collection of paper dolls is a bit of a mixed bag. Some are wonderful, like Faye Dunaway with gorgeous costumes from ""Network"", ""Chanatown"" and ""The Towering Inforno"", and Liza Minnelli with the expected costumes from ""Cabaret"" and two other films. Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn are well portrayed, but the selection of costumes for the stars is disappointing.The low point of this collection is a goofy looking Meryl Streep with the dowdiest costumes imaginable. For a book titled ""Glamorous Movies Stars of the Eighties etc"" I expected glamorous costumes to accompany the dolls."
5,A Memoir to Remember,"I just Finished-for the 3rd time reading ""Jumping Fire"". Each time I have gleaned more insight into smokejumping and one man's memories of it.The author is obviously a passionate man w/a love & reverence for the work that he did and the people that he knew. Through his eyes we are allowed into a world only a few have actually experienced.The scenes he paints with words help us to visualize what it might have been for us had we been there to see the panoramic view of an Alaskan vista-or to taste the acrid smoky air while on a fire. Mr. Taylor shares with us an accurate account of the work, friendship and heartache that are commonplace in the life of a smokejumper.While living today in a world where heroes and bravery are not as commonplace as yesteryear, ""Jumping Fire"" renews our respect for those so willing to put their life on the line for us and for nature."
1,Give it a miss,"A poorly written, testosterone drenched missive about fighting fires in Alaska. The writer fills the book with lots of macho interchanges between himself and other smokejumpers, acronyms, procedures and buzzwords. However, when all is said and done, the reader is left with insight into what it is like to be a smokejumper that equals the knowledge they would receive listening to a nun trying to explain an orgasam.The author spends considerible amounts of time feeling sorry for himself because he can't begin or maintain a relationship because of the life he leads. I thought the book was going to be about smokejumpers, yet large parts of it read like a 15 year old boy's diary.Completely unsatisfying. I'm truly glad I didn't pay full price for the book. Do yourself a favor and give it a miss."
4,Ever wonder who those people really are....,"The voice of the jumper base comes alive when a crackle is heard and the jumpers, male and female come alive as they are just beginning to hear the news a fire has broken out somewhere on in the forest. The only way of transportation is the unique style of smokejumping, male and female brave enough to enter an atmosphere that feels as you are on the way down a toasted marshmallow. In all smokejumpers and hotshots are the elite fire crews of the west, including ground pounders but nothing matches them more than anything. From the sky to the ground they are greeted to new heights and ways of survival and compatability."
2,A TEXTBOOK ON FIREFIGHTING,"The majority of readers of Jumping Fire rate it as a ""5"" read...a very good book indeed.When I got to page 71 I decided I just didn't want to keep going as there are other books I would like better. Murry Taylor does a good job in telling about his work, however, for me, it was more like a textbook as the vocabulary was firefighter-eze and the detail about exact locations and the descent from the airplane to the ground was so intense that you could draw a map of what was going on. I am not a topographer and that topic does not hold me.The writing effort is heartfelt, but I couldn't keep going after page 71."
3,"Interesting, but repetitious","I usually find books that are not like Hollywood action movies fresh and new, but this one is just plain dull in some spots. There is a certain mystique about smoke jumping, but Taylor's book was countless trips to fire/battle fire/drink free-dried coffee/moan about love life. Now I'm not saying this what they do, but this scenario must have happened at least 6 times in the book. At roughly 440 pages, I thought the book was about 120 pages too long. Overall entertaining, but I would highly recommend this one."
3,Not what i thought i was purchasing,"I bought the foodsaver thinking i was getting a foodsaver kit with the canisters and the suction lids and the bottle savers.What does come with this kit is the foodsaver 1050,large roll of bags,a video tape on how to use it and a tube to fill the accesories that you dont get with this kit. The 179.99 price I saw for full retail included a couple of canisters and a bottle saver and the lid savers that you dont get with this kit so i was a bit dissapointed with this kit for the price. However I think they have a terrific product and the video tape is very informative."
2,No Accessories,"I purchsed this thinking I too would receive all the items the non-reconditioned unit had....it does not. I do love the unit though...use it all the time, especially for marinating beef and chicken and preserving salads. I had to buy all the containers though!"
3,Zipper broke,The zipper on the mattress cover broke while we were putting the cover on. The mattress cover was fine other than the cheap zipper.
5,Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,"Classic Sam Clemens + science fiction. An old favorite of mine, available digitally, now a part of my Kindle book collection."
5,Great read. Mark Twain is my favorite author.,"Great insight into Twain's view of heaven and religion. Very funny and, as always, beautifully written. This is an excellent, short read."
3,Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,"it was just okay. I didn't dislike it, but I can live without it. It wasn't a drama or adventure. I don't know HOW I would classify it, but it wasn't that great."
2,Average war documentary,"This looks at the various weapons inventions designed to overcome German resistance during the years of planning that led up to the D-Day Invasion. It features some interesting recollections by veterans, but is marred by far too much recreated action by actors. There is plenty of actual footage that could have been tapped. A sequence showing a latter day effort to make a tank float is just silly and is out of place."
4,Great story and great lessons,"I bought this book for my twin two year old nephews (along with a stuffed armadillo). I bought it for the lessons (don't cross/careful crossing the road) and the sweet story. They love it and the art work is adorable. They're a little young for the lesson but since they're so engaged with the story now I think they'll keep it around long enough for the lessons, too."
2,B-Movies for sure!,Don't waste your time ordering this unless you are having a low-budget movie night!!! This was just plan awful:(The color is bad and blur through out the movie! Don't Buy
5,Love It!!!,I love reading this every morning. Helps me to start my day in a great mood and continue the mood throughout the day.
3,Accomplished but where's the poetry?,"This is a decent, if not inspired, collection of some of Poulenc's wonderful music for solo piano. There has always been the question of the use of ""rubato"" in Poulenc and I recall reading somewhere that Poulenc forbade it entirely. If that's true, than Tacchino is spot-on in his performances. But I missed the poetry that Artur Rubenstein brought to the wonderful 2nd Intermezzo in Db, especially the cadence of wonderful chords at the end. The tempos in this recording seem so straighforward as to sound rushed and workmanlike at times. The dazzling Presto in Bb (written for Horowitz) is played brilliantly here and overall this is a good basic introduction to this important collection of 20th Century piano music by one of its masters. One can only imagine in despair what treasures might have come from Poulenc's pen had he not died at age 63."
5,ANOTHER CLASSIC FROM THE WEST,"SHADE SHIEST came correct with this smash hit, i remeber when this first came out that this song as being played every wwhere. this was the surprise smash hit of the summer. the tight laid back west coast bat was a amazing. also new comer SHADE SIEST has a very interesting voice that makes you want to listen. also he must have known he would have a hit when he got NATE DOGG, and my favorite rapper KURUPT to be on the song. first off you have the hook king Nate who probably has been involved in more hits then any one alive, and secondly youhane KURUPT who is one of the most respsected west coast rappers of all time. it's no surprise that this was a hit, and i recommend it to you all."
1,Bharatiya Kala Prakashan edition is a Very poor quality work.,The Bharatiya Kala Prakashan edition is simply not usable. It is of very poor quality with many typos and even missing words. Notes and Appendices from the older editions are simply not in the new edition. The older Pali Text Society edition is excellent. BKP should be ashamed of what they have done to this book.
4,Pretty good for the price,"These are very clear headlight bulbs, with a slight hue of blue making them look very cool. Installation is a breeze and the price is excellent. On the downside they are not very bright, i certainly wouldnt think they were 90/100watt bulbs. If your looking for a nice cheap upgrade that enhances the look of your vehicle these are just right for you, but if you want something that is very bright, steer clear of these."
4,Great little coming-of-age film,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, about a precocious Welsh kid taking his first steps toward navigating the so-called ""adult"" world. The director's work is pitch-perfect. Made me remember what it was like to be 14 or 15 -- and that counts as a major accomplishment! The two young actors at the center of the piece are terrific, and so are the boy's parents and their semi-creepy, semi-pathetic neighbor, who has designs on Our Hero's mum.This reminded me a little of ""Rushmore (The Criterion Collection)but it's both more clever and less pretentious. Reaching way, way back, it has a bit of the antic disposition of the early Malcolm MacDowell filmIf... (The Criterion Collection)but ""Submarine"" is way less bitter, violent, and snarky.Only problem I had is that it was occasionally hard to make out the dialog because of the Welsh accents. Don't worry though, it's not mumblecore.Highly recommended if you like whimsy and gentle eccentricity in your Bildungsroman."
1,Forgettable,"Negatives:(1.) Breathtaking scenic backdrop only if you've been raised and spent your entire existence in the urban jungle otherwise just a few quick scenes of brushy small hills and a really run-of-the-mill ocean beach (e.g. a few rocks and a few small waves that a chipmunk would find surfable).(2.) Nothing creative, different or memorable in the recycled countless times before storyline of two socially outcast teens who form an attachment with each other. Also nothing new in the same old issues with parents whether it's lack of understanding, lack of coolness, health issues or whatever.(3.) Actors did a decent job of portraying their roles with appropriate quirkiness but the scripted roles themselves were just unbelievably unbelievable. Almost as if the writer was autobiographically retelling yet embellishing his own growing up isolated problems.Positives:(1.) The DVD was free.(2.) In three days, no residual memory - simply forgotten."
1,Is Whales a county in England?,The women in this movie could have had far larger breasts and there was not a single high speed car chase or explosion.An American!P.S. - Why haven't we invaded Whales yet? We could make far more covering the county with strip malls then we will ever make concurring Iraq and Afghanistan.
4,First half is better than the second half,"This coming-of-age British dramedy has some terrific performances by lead actor Craig Roberts and Yasmin Paige, who steals every scene that she is in. The first half of the film focuses on these two, who play teenager Oliver Tate and the girl he becomes involved with. Unfortunately, the second half is centered around the relationship between Oliver's mother (played by Sally Hawkins) and another man, which is much less interesting. However, I still recommend the movie for its quirky and often amusing screenplay and Roberts and Paige's wonderful performances."
5,A prominent thinker who suffered from unspeakable loss,"The first half of the movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. The second half is fairly depressing but,because of the first, this is one of my new all time favorites. I think it's one of those movies you'll either love or hate but, if you enjoy dry indie films, you should love it. Unsure? ""Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me explore your perfect body. I could drink your blood, you're the only person I would allow to be shrunken down to a microscopic size and swim inside me in a tiny submersible machine. we've lost our virginity but it wasn't like losing anything. You're too good for me, you're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver."""
4,Ayoade did good,"Bittersweet angst-ridden kid stuff well-done!Sweetly done by Richard Ayoade, who played an entertaining role in The Mighty Boosh(correct?). I can easily imagine Ayoade speaking the lines in many instances.Music selection is okay. Maybe it fits the film best. Break down though and use some music that is less, hmmm, eclectic or pretentious(?). Whatever.Nice actors chosen for the roles. Sally Hawkins is always attractive and the dad was excellent.Profanity, sexuality, violence, political tilt are all acceptable and nonexistent.Nothing offensive except a strange message at the film start about America not invading England and rubbish. Is this supposed to reflect a child's attempt at political awareness and making his voice heard? A message as delivered from Oliver, I suppose, which might fit the film context. (Bashing America is old hat nonsense)I was interested and entertained throughout."
3,OK,"""Submarine with Craig Roberts, and Yasmin Paige""; Submarine, is a story of a boy coming of age. He has two of objectives before he turns 16: the first is to lose his virginity before his birthday and second is to break up his mother and an ex lover who has suddenly appeared in her life, which concerns him as she may be cheating on his father. ""This film that is rated R makes some very weird twists and turns. I can honestly say that I was confused at times in what it was trying to actually say! I can honestly say that I have seen other movies that were very good and funny that were of the same subject that did the job much better than this one had done.I will admit that I did giggle in a few areas of this film, but I really cannot recommend purchasing this video unless you have extra money to waste. I would recommend renting it if you're curious to see it.I hope this review is helpful so you know if this might be something of your interest."
5,British coming of age movie,"I picked out this movie because I noticed that was produced by Ben Stiller, one of the best comedians today. I expected movie to be smart and funny and I was not let down. Film is written and directed by Richard Ayoade. This is the first of his movies that I have seen so far and I absolutely loved it. Story is original and actors are carefully chosen. It is a coming of age movie, setup in England. The main protagonist is a teenage boy Oliver Tate, who is romantic daydreamer, experiencing confusion upon discovering feelings of attraction and love towards his classmate Jordana. He is also determined to save his parents deteriorating marriage.The title of the movie ""Submarine"" is highly fitting the story. It is as if all of the characters are deep under the sea and if not careful, close to suffocating. It is also the exploration of the innner feelings and young teenager boy has that are sometimes overwhelming and sometimes over-dramatic or too self-absorbing."
3,Amusing British Indie Movie,I really like British humor so I thought this would be right up my alley. It was a little funny in some parts but less than I expected. Overall a decent movie to watch to pass the time.
3,Meh...,"I generally appreciate British humor and quirky comedies, and I really wanted to like this movie because I liked Richard Aoyade so much on ""The IT Crowd."" (Just to be clear, he's the director of the film; he does not act in it.) It wasn't a bad little movie, but it felt pretty flat overall. The acting was good, and the story was certainly quirky enough (in fact, a bit quirkier than I cared for), but I thought the humor wasn't all that humorous.What it really reminded me of was one of Wes Anderson's less successful efforts; so imagine what Wes Anderson's take on a coming-of-age film set in a Welsh town...directed on an off day for Wes Anderson...and that's pretty much what ""Submarine"" is like. If that sounds awesome to you, then, seriously, have at. Otherwise, you should probably pass."
2,Submarine DVD,This DVD did not work for me straight away because Submarine has not actually come out in Australia which meant the area code was not right .So I had to change the area code on my laptop to US code to actually play the DVD.But Submarine is an extraordinary film.
5,pure wisdom,"This book edited by David Lang, is one of the most accesible books of Douglas Harding. It may bring you from hear - say to look - see. Highly recommanded.Douglas and Catherine have visited me in my house here in Belgium, and they are wonderful people, indeed. I hope you can meet them one day.You can read the preface Douglas wrote for my first book on my website, []Jan Kersschot, author of ""nobody home"""
2,Does not help sweaty feet,If you have sweaty feet nothing helps but aluminum chloride at night/foot powder and good wool socks during the day.gave it two stars because it could help smelly feet.
1,Lavilin Foot Deodorant,"I really did not like the product, it dried my feet out, it did not accomplish for me what I had hoped that it would. I made a bad choice in purchasing this item."
3,Not what i thought,I bought this for my daughter's stinky feet. I applied as directed and it did work.....for a day. Most of the reviews and even the product information says one application should work for up to 7 days. We couldn't get two days out of it. I have since discoverd that a vitamin deficiency can cause feet to stink and we are trying a different approach. If you are desperate it is worth a try but it may not last as long as it says.
2,it could smell better.....,its really thick and doesn't really have a pleasurable smell to itill try something else next timemaybe lavilin will make a better product next time ;)
2,"Maybe OK for others, but not for me","I ordered this product based on the reviews of other people who found it to be very effective on their foot odor. I receieved this and immediately started using it, following all directions. I didn't put any other product on my feet, applied it every few days and in the proper amount to the proper area, but my feet still STINK!! I even tried using it every other day, but that just left me waking up in the middle of the night with itchy feet. In the end, I still use it in the hopes that maybe one day it will begin to work, but for now, I don't see it doing any good."
4,Efective foot deodorant,"I think it was a good buy. I use a very, very, very small amount every week (on Sunday night, before sleep) and I forget about my stinky feet during 1 entire week, even if I use a stinky pair of shoes or if I use socks. The only problem is it dryes my feet a little, but it is the little of my problems."
5,great product!,"This product is amazing!It made a difference the very next day!I usually have to throw away shoes after a ""season"" because they smell so bad. I used to use food powder, shoe deodorant, I even tried putting my shoes in the freezer because I read that helped with the stink (of course they were sealed in a bag).This is the first product to actually get rid of my foot odor.I definitely recommend this product!"
4,"Good Tool, Good Price","I saw a unit similiar to this when my plumber was clearing a drain line in my home. It worked very well. I purchased this item to reduce the call-in cost of $75.00 and labour costs of $45.00/hour, minimum 4 hours. Price difference is substantial. The unit only works when completely inserted into drain line. Mine burst on the second use, as I did not have the unit completed inserted. It swelled at the hose connection and with the use of hot water and pressure, it broke. I still have a larger unit which works very well and I intend to purchase another ""Small"" version. Good Tool, Good Price."
3,Good Examples BUT...a little too theoretical,"I've used this book for a graduate course in Dynamic Programming. Having used many of Mr. Ross's books (undergraduate and graduate), I found this one lacks the detail and lucidity (particularly the end of chapter problems...I believe in ""learning by doing""... i.e. solve lots of problems!) that I have come to know of his books (e.g. A First Course in Probability and Introduction to Probability Models). The bright spot of the book is its examples, which are interesting and fairly detailed."
3,Its an OK book,"The book was vey well written, but not nearly as good as the other Nightmare Room books. If you are reading this review, K am not telling you not to buy it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Good product, reasonably priced.","Could have been better on shipping charges (bulk, instead of charging for 1 each). Product works fine."
2,wrong shirt,i read what people had to say about this shirt. i wasn't so lucky. i got nothing like the picture looks like. no purple or aqua. i got what looks like another pulse concentric tie dye shirt that's for sale. dark in the front with a little white tie dye around the circle. the main color of the shirt is dark blue. it looks like a guys shirt.i wanted what i saw in the picture and didn't get it.i gave the shirt to my husband that was sent to me.i am disappointed.
1,careful about size!! if you're slim then this tshirt is not for you!,"ordered two: one for me, one for my bro. His size L fits on him (he's a lil fat),, but the size M for me is too short and too broad. I guess that's why they reduced the price.. figuring out how to lengthen the tshirt,, any suggestions anyone?"
3,Spectacular claims...,"In short, Exempt from Disclosure, is a compilation of alleged facts, rumours and speculation regarding the U.S. governments involment with E.T. The information is compiled by a group of men who, having once held various posiitons high in the U.S. airforce or like departments, subsequently became privy to information exmept from disclosure.[...]Nevertheless, if the information on offer is true, this is one of the most important books you'll ever read. Admittedly, some of the information on offer here seems very plausible and concurs with the testaments of various others in the field. Just treat it with a pinch of salt for the time being."
2,Plan 9 From Collins & Doty,"First, it is poorly written, with numerous typos. Second, it is poorly sourced, using Wikipedia and UFO websites as references. Even worse, some of the references are emails or web postings by Rick Doty. The foundation of the material is based on unreliable and discredited sources such as the MJ-12 papers, the stories of Bob Lazar, Dan Burisch and Bill Moore. Worse yet, these tall tales are not even entertaining. Skip this one, and read some Gray Barker books instead- closer to the truth, more fun and better written!They Knew Too Much about Flying Saucers"
4,Exempt from disclosure,Makes for good reading states facts as he has been given them by what appears to be credibile sources. It is up to us to decide to believe or not believe wether we have visitors here on Earth.
5,Exempt from disclosure,I have just read the first two chapters and WOW this book answers many suspision I have had about our Goverment. I is a must read book!
4,A hard to find book,My only reason for granting this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that I know that the author is working on an updated version!
4,"Mozart: Piano Sonatas, K448, K501, K521, K381","Mozart: Piano Sonatas, K448, K501, K521, K381 is a 1994 Teldec Classics International recording starring pianists Martha Argerich and Alexandre Rabinovitch. Robert Forster has written the music notes. English translation by Stewart Spencer. I usually love Mozart but the one problem with this recording is the pace. Both pianists seem a little too happy to play at a very high pace. Like they are in a rush to get over with the recording. Where is the love of the music? The intense feeling? Still it is a fine enough recoding. But would have been a bit better with a slower pace. Recommended. 4/5."
5,Mozart duo piano,"Gorgeous! However, I'm trying to learn one of the pieces. My teacher has asked me NOT to listen again. Never in a blue moon will I be able to play like that! Someday, when I no longer care about what I'm able to do or NOT to do, I'll enjoy these talented pianists."
1,Oh.......Paul,"When you hear the name Paul Di'anno, there is probably only one thing you think of...IRON MAIDEN. And this DVD has shown me the reason why you don't think of Paul's solo career...because, to say the least, it is not good. This DVD is full of not-so-great loved-up tunes, in which the keyboard will probably turn you gay if heard for more than 15 minutes straight. Now, one of the reasons this DVD is bad, is because the music sound very dated. When I listen to bands like Iron Maiden, Dio, or Judas Priest, I don't think ""this was the 80's."" I think ""this is some pretty awesome music."" But when I hear the music on this DVD coming out of my speakers, it just sounds to much like the 80's. I immediately think of hot pink tights, poofy hair, and other stupid 80's cliche fashion trends. Maybe it is just me...but I don't want my music to sound so dated"
1,The dictionary is published in 1973,"The dictionary is published in 1973......The use by such dictionary has brought to me more harms, than advantage. For the dictionary respectable age - 25 years. If wine from long storage increases the value, with the dictionaries this principle is very doubtful... I have sad experience of a purchase of dictionaries of this RUSSO publishing house. The majority of the dictionaries of this RUSSO publishing house is stereotyped republishings of the dictionaries issued in former USSR."
3,Country Fiddle could be improved,"This video is made for an intermediate player and not for a true beginner. The instructor assumes that you already know proper hand position, finger positions, name of chords, and other basic elements of playing the instrument. This isn't a negative statement; it's just a fact. The main problem I have with the video is the distance (and angle) from which the video is recorded. The instructor is viewed in the middle 1/3 of the screen with plenty of vacant room to spare on each side. It is difficult to see any of the techiques he is verbally explaining throughout the video. It would have been much more effective and useful to either: 1. Zoom In the camera at key moments or 2. Use a second camera that would show a close-up of his hand positions in a window of the main video (eg. picture in picture on TV's). Overall, you might want to wait for the sequel."
2,Very frustrating video,"This video was very frustrating to try and learn from. This video is not even close to being a beginners video. The instructor teaches by telling you what fingers to use in a very quick and unclear manner. Since notes are never displayed, I could not figure out what note he was really instructing me to play. It was not only difficult trying to figure out what note he wanted me to play, but also what count to give the note. The instructor says to look at his fingers, however the video is not presented in a manner that allows that kind of clear view. I became so frustrated by this video that I didn't even bother to watch the whole thing."
5,Neon yellow,I bought this for my father because after 5 years of his original one the clip broke. I selected the yellow because his old black one was hard to find but this one does everything but glow in the dark lol.
5,Fantastic!,"Tenebrea's Hope was awesome! Roxann Dawson and Daniel Graham have proved themselves extremely talented novelists, once again. I highly reccomend this book.P.S. It's essential that you read Entering Tenebrea before you read this one."
4,Witty and Fun,"A very good show, cancelled too soon. James Woods and a great cast. I wish the Blu-Ray disc was available for this show."
5,Shark Season 2,Great season. Shark's character has depth. Now that Jessica is part of his team makes it even more interesting. Please keep this series in the fall line up.
5,Great baby soft ball,"Got this ball for Christmas for our then 5 months old baby boy - who's initials are MVP :-)I like the quality, my son loves to play with it and so far we did not have any problems - they say you can even mashine wash it - have not tried it yet, though.Would recommend it to anybody!"
3,not perfect,arm not move enough to hold half full roll. very nice looking but not too useful. More thought should go into products this expensive.
2,Too lightweight,"Towel holder looks good, but is not weighted enough to keep it from tilting when you pull a towel off. I returned mine."
1,Unbelievable waste of money....,Not even a complete conversation that has been edited. Three questions asked by HBR with shortish replies from Richard Saul Wurman.Save your money.
3,Meh,"I've owned 3 jack rabbits since 2007 and the one that i have now will be my last. my first one was great! but eventually the cord came out. then i bought another one and it only last 4ish uses. i'm still not sure what happened... and yes, for SOME reason, i bought another. it's the ""newer"" model i guess and they reconfigured the control pack, which i HATE. it kept turning on if something hit the dials, so i started taking the batteries out (which you should do anyways because this sucker DRAINS them). the control pack also doesn't hold the batteries in very well. and i know this is kind of lame, but it's seriously annoying to have to put the batteries in every. single. time. lastly, i found this model was not as strong as the other 2 i owned before. it's pretty weak. anyways, i give it 3 stars because of the good one i had for almost 3 years."
1,If I would have known I wouldn't have bought it. . .,If you buy this just make sure you take the batteries out after every time you use it because it will drain them. . also it doesn't hold the batteries in very tight so sometimes the batteries will move around and it will turn off . . .thats not cool when your almost. . there. . .
3,It does it job,"My only complaint with this product would be he cord and remote. It was a little awkward, but I guess i works fine other than that. I wish I just would have gotten a cordless."
4,Loved it.,It's a really great product. I had never used anything like it before. Just one word of advice: take the batteries out after every use. It can turn on without your knowing it. Nothing sucks more when you're in the mood with no batteries.
2,Average at best,"If heads are aware this King George cat used to share mic time with Master P in the earlier days. If anyone told King George that rap was for him, they were mistaken. His production is average, the lyrics suffer greatly from unoriginality and his gruff voice cuts right through his beats. Borrow this from somebody cuz you'll probably return it the same day."
4,IRT,"This is a good ""second"" book for those interested in the theory behind IRT and how various IRT models interrelate. If you're interested in learning the basics about IRT or applying it toward your research, then I recommend you also purchase an introductory book such as Sijtsma's introduction to nonparametric IRT."
5,Excellent Quick Guide,This book does an excellent job of quickly covering a broad spectrum of concepts pertaining to Polytomous Item Response Models! I found it to be well written and easy to understand. It is a very good resource for someone seeking to learn more about these models or to refresh their memory.
1,pain in the ass: not for chronic constipation,"This is fairly easy to apply with straightforward instructions. However, I experienced a lot of cramping with this product within minutes. At first I felt gassy and next thing you know I'm on the ground in pain. It feels like an evil mutant oreck vacuum is litterally sucking the crap out of my stomach. I felt like a victim of a very bad sci-fi movie. Sadly, it only helped a little. Even if I did work, I still question whether its worth the pain."
4,"Works great, better than Ex-Lax. It creates a more gentle ""rush"" but it tastes horrid.","I used to use ExLax, it was let say quite a violent reaction however the taste of the ex-lax chocolate is actually quite good. Great idea to keep away from children.Then I used Mirilax, it's great, nice soft gentle release but the effect is not 100% guaranteed, sometimes it will take a few days of taking it before I could see and feel the results.The Dulcolax is right inbetween Ex-Lax and Mirilax time to effect with a gentler reaction then Ex-Lax but not as gentle as Mirilax.Also Mirilax has no taste (you add the powder to any drink) whereupon this tastes horrid and leaves a greasy feel in my mouth."
5,works well !,"works exactly as stated on the box without any of the additional side effects. i, unfortunately have to take narcotics for chronic pain and as result suffer from chronic constipation. i do not like taking yet ""another pill"" so occasionally i will use these suppositories for relief. they work quickly and are effective. enough said."
3,"Impractical, raunchy, and pretty darn funny","A friend lent me this small, vinyl-covered pink book, and I read it in about two days. It's a fun, comedic chick guide for the all-American road trip, packing one-liners and humorous drawings in side-by-side with suggestions for trip destinations and crazy traveling advice. The book encourages girls to get out of the ruts in their lives and hit the highway with their favorite tunes. Packing light, eating junk, picking up cute hitchikers, and taking wild friends are must-dos, according to Tuttle. While most of the book's suggestions (such as using marshmallows to plug a muffler hole or jam a parking meter) are totally implausible, they do provide a few laughs. Not on my must-read list, but a nice, quick little book if you need a light pick-me-up."
5,Fabulous book for woman who need to get away!,"This book managed to fit tons of valuable on-the-road knowledge into a slim book that will travel well in the glove compartment. The humor set the pace, and made me want to get into my car and head out for... well, wherever I end up! Kudos!"
2,Neither helpful nor funny,"Disappointing. The humor is strained and undirected, while useful information is sparse. Silly, rather than genuinely funny. Check out Cynthia Heimel's ""Sex Tips for Girls"" instead, where you'll find real humor and unintentionally good advice."
4,"Incredibly witty, creative and a must-have on a road trip!","Cameron Tuttle does not encourage we women to suddenly go out and do a Thelma and Louise on the unsuspecting back roads of the United States, but she sure knows how to have a good time. For all you gal pals who suddenly get the itch to just ""take off"" this book is essential to have in your purse, back pack, or glove compartment. Think of it as the kind of book you wish you had when you were a child on all those boring road trips, when you didn't know where you were going or how long it would take to get there. Now, you're in control. You have the road games. You have the laughs. It's even a handy travel diary! It's slim, it's chock full of fun and info, and it's inexpensive. It can't be beat."
5,reading it made me feel like i had just been on a road trip!,"this book was great! i never would've bothered getting a ""road trip"" book since i don't even have my licence yet, but reading it was almost like reading fiction - i could feel myself doing all the things she described! she's a great writer. also, now i know more about cars, secret weapons i didn't know i had, and how to keep fit while on the road! sure, you'd look strange doing those exercises, but hey, you might get a few coins for it ;).overall wonderful book. bring it with you even if you're just driving to the 7-11. you never know when the ""mother road"" will call..."
5,As Necessary as TP for the road.,"As Dakota Lawless on the road I have crossed the US in many forms and following many guides and maps. Being a rest stop connesure from before this book was published, I think this book was long overdue. It is hilarious and a great idea finder for when ya just need to get out or need to release your own bad self. Me and my cohort Tess Honeywine have used the book for many a fun weekend. the bad girl of the open road is a great new breed of traveler and now recognizable by the great sticker. Thanx for the bad girl guide!!!! Dakota Lawless"
4,"Very good book on ayurveda, cures and ayurvedic wines",This is nice book to have at home. It has good explanation about deseases and their cures with ayurvedic ways. It gives reciepes to make famous ayurvedic medicines also which are hard to find. Gives information ayurvedic wines also and how those can help in keeping good health.
5,Ayurvedic Heaing,Ayurvedic Healing by Dr Frawley is an excellent book. It is well written and easy to understand. It is a much needed addition to my alternative medicine library. I have dealt with Amazon for a while. They have not disappointed me yet.
1,basic information,I do not buy books on customer reviews but I question book reviews first time after reading this book. I buy books because I want to read and own it. This book gives very basic information which is available online. Its very confusing beyond ayurvedic information on tastes and doshas.
1,The cover doesn't fit the basket,"Bought this 3 weeks ago, the material is as expected.But the big problem is the cover cannot slip over the basket! No matter how hard I tried.After 30 minutes, I was in a sweat and decided just to returned it."
1,"Perpetrates abuse, and spiritually abusive","My mom changed when she got this book as a ""joke"" from my abusive father. haha, sure. ""joke."" She changed for the worse, giving up the little fight she still had in her, and let my father steamroll over the family and abuse the kids.You can download it for free off of the cult's website (Caritas in Birmingham) and see for yourself without paying any money for it. It advises wives to stay in abusive marriages even when the husband abuses her and the children, which is DANGEROUS.One particularly appalling story the book upholds as a shining example of submission is the wife who remained submissive even as her husband tried to kill her with a hammer to the skull.If you still are tempted to buy this book, please google Caritas in Birmingham and Terry Colafrancesco before reading the book. It is NOT Catholic, and it is NOT true to the story of the apparitions at Medjugorje."
5,The Secret of Marriage,"This should be a must read for every couple beginning with the wife or wife to be. This book has the secret of happiness in a marriage. If you want your marriage to be better, then wives read this book! The ultimate in love is knowing thyself, and that your love is a treasure that begins in you with the Holy Spirit. If all women were to read this book before they married, and followed it, there would never be a divorce.JohnLongmont, Colorado"
1,This is not Stepford!,"My mother-in-law gave me this book. I AM a christian and I DID try to read that book with an open mind. Holy cow. Let's just send women back to the stone age. Ridicule working women, ridicule women who use daycare, ridicule women who have opinions and a mind of their own. Let NOW get a hold of this one, LOL! My husband and I laughed our butts off reading this hooey. Yes...it's one thing to treat your spouse with respect and dignity but ""submit""????? When hubby does first!"
4,Gnew monsters in not necessarily the better-than-ever format,"Monster Manual III brings you just what you would expect: hordes of new monsters to challenge your players.The composition of different types of monsters is quite balanced, DMs who like strange aberrations, undead or other unearthly creatures will find as many good new foes, as DMs who are looking for new feys or magical beasts.Also, monsters of all challenge rating levels make it easy for the DM to find the right creature for the game.Several monsters advance by character class, so those DMs who do not spare the time and effort to add character levels to the base creature can create really unique and dangerous foes.The only weak point of the book - at least in my oppinion - is the section describing the monster's place in Eberron or in the Forgotten Realms. While in some cases it gives great ideas for encounters or even for whole adventures, sometimes you can feel that it is only there to add some more text to the book."
3,Just another Monster Manual,"While it doesn't score gold in my book, the MM3 is a decent monster manual. After perusing the book, you quickly get a sense that the monsters within were not drawn from mythological origins so much as niche encounter fillers. From Arcane ooze to Cadaver Collectors, I really feel that the MM line is running out of juice. While most of the creatures are solid challenges for games, they mostly feel just like that - obstacles thrown in the way of characters and not creatures with a history and sense of purpose in the game world, despite the attempts to tie them down to specific worldsets."
3,Useful if your careful,There are many imaginative creatures within the MMIII and I have enjoyed using the new Lizardfolk and Voidminded Creatures. Having more creatures for your adventures is always helpful to keep your players challenged but this book suffers from one major problem. The creatures tend to be under rated and therefore can be extremely deadly if you use the CR ratings in the book to balance your fights. Easily overcomed if you take the time to review the creatures you are using to make sure they fit what you have planned.
2,These Monsters Are Preposterous,"This book simply throws ideas out that are simply ridiculous. I think I'll be lucky to make use of more than 2 or 3 of these monsters. The only ones that are remarkable are the new giants (and seriously you'd have to plan a whole campaign to make these fit somehow). Unless you like to throw random monsters at your players (which is a lame way to DM and is even more boring than fighting the same monsters again and again) this book is just too bizzarre. I'm agonna avoid MM4 too. With this trend, the new monsters could be nothing other than preposterous."
1,garbage,"Wizards is really scraping the barrel with this one. Wizards has obviously run out of ORIGINAL ideas. It's like a bunch of guys got together in a room, smoked allot of pot and just threw together a bunch of chracteristics from other monsters and combined them into one monster. I can't believe people pay for this **it When are people going to THINK for themselves. Wizards does not own D&D. The people who play it do. The game was finished decades ago. Every reiteration is just money for Wizards. Wizards is in it for the PROFIT. If a pile of steaming dog **it on a plate could be sold for profit they would do it. Wake up!"
5,I can listen to this any time of year!,I've had this cd for several years and it remains one of my favorites. There's no substitute for a great vocal performance. Young artists should take a hint.
1,Empress Maud or Matilda????,"Thanks to Ms. Garwood's fiction, the identities of the Empress Maud, Countess of Anjou and Matilda, WIFE of King Stephen have been thoroughly confused. How is it that so many other authors have been able to keep the two women straight?? See Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries and Sharon Kay Penman's ""When Christ and His Saints Slept"" for more historically accurate fiction, in addition to any good listing of English royalty."
2,"Nice love story, but completely fictional...","If you are in a mood of reading some romance staff, go on... If you want real historical fiction, true-to-life characters and atmosphere, go search somewhere else. Although the storyline is within the popular historical myth (or not myth, but I'm afraid we shall never know for sure: That Henry was Mathilda's and Stephen's son etc), the way characters act (especially Mathilda, although she is the King's daughter, would not be allowed by standards of behaviour of her time to spit her newly-wed husband, the King (!), in the face, nor would he tolerate it), is completely unpersuasive. They remind me characters of some modern soap-opera. True, I agree that intrigues and affairs existed in all times, but why dress them in 12th century costumes then?"
1,The worst book I have ever tried to read,"Haley Elizabeth Garwood is both the worst writer and the worst researcher I have ever encountered. For all the research touted on the back of the book, the author clearly made up most of the story, and in the process, trivialized the lifes of some of the most fascinating people in history. Perhaps, had the writing been good enough to carry the story, it would have been worthwhile anyway, but unfortunately, it was not. I was unable to make it through more than half of this book before I threw it away. I felt it would be too unethical to even sell this book at a used book shop as the unwitting purchaser would have been sadly wasting their money and I didn't want to be a party to that."
4,"Great sound, check the package first!","My only complaint about this product is that the parts department missed a little detail. It arrived without nuts for the U-bolt that holds it together. Not a huge deal, but as I live in DE if i hadnt lucked out and a couple of random ones that fit i would have been stuck."
4,Petey Puts Out a Great Sophomore Effort,"Petey Pablo is a rapper who does his own thing. His songs are his own and he brings an individuality that is almost gone from hip-hop these days. These days everyone wants to be Fifty Cent, 2Pac, Biggie. They are all three legends, but to really make a mark in this game you have to be original. Petey delivers. As far as the album goes:1. Part 2 - 4/52. Did You Miss Me - 3/53. Jam Y'all - 5/54. Freek A Leek - 5/55. O It's On - 5/56. Let's Roc - 4/57. Stick 'Em Up - 3/58. Get On Dis Motorcycle - 5/59. Break Me Off - 3/510. Boy's Bathroom - 3/511. U Don't Want Dis - 4/512. What You Know About It - 3/513. I Swear - 4/514. Roll Off - 4/515. Be Country - 4/516. He Spoke to Me - 5/517. Vibrate - 4/5"
2,If your not an avid fan of Petey...,"I bought this CD because I loved the Freak-a-leek song but that's about the only song that's great on this CD. If you're more into the hip hop style and good dance beats, burn the single instead."
2,Petey is wack,"Petey is wack as hell, he can't rap, it makes me disappointed to see that he is from north carolina, and it makes me disappointed to see that his first single was tapped in raleigh, but its all good cause he wont really come bac cuz 9 deuce got sumthang for that azz"
4,"Freek-A-Leek is not the only song on this CD, folks.","It seems that most negative reviews on this CD center around the fact that Freek-A-Leek is a nasty song about sex. Great, (...) I don't really like that song either, but there's a whole album to review, not just one song. If you listen to the rest of the tracks, you'll find that Freek-A-Leek is one of, if not THE, weakest track(s) on this CD. It doesn't even fit with the rest of the CD; it was clearly made to be a single standing on its own, much like ""Hey Ya"" was on The Love Below.The production is fairly good. 25 or 6 to 4 was somehow sampled in a way that sounds good on ""What you know bout it"". The lyrics are thoughtful for the most part, and they do center on repping NC. And he actually can sing (""He Spoke To Me""). Well, for a rapper at least.Is it the best record I've ever heard? No, it's not. And no single track blows me away. But if you want to evaluate the record as a whole, realize there are tracks besides Freek-A-Leek."
1,Mainstream Hip Hop has hit bottom,"Actually, mainstream rap hit bottom like 4-5 years ago. Guys like Petey Pablo brought shovels with em though and are just digging the hole deeper. I will always love REAL hip hop, but the stuff that they play on the radio nowadays is so dumb and uncreative. Every song is about being in the club or hitting girls from the back. This is garbage. That's what you write in your diary? If you have half a brain you probably are aware of all of this already and if you're into this crap you need to see what good hip hop is. Go to your local music store and find EPMD, Eric B. & Rakim, the first Nas album, the first Jay-Z album, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Blackalicious, Madlib, etc."
1,Ugggghhh,"Everyone is hyped up on that stupid song freek a leek. That song is sooo lame, stupid, and dumb....just like every other pop music in tha radio station. I never bought thiz album but i heard a couple of trackz from my boyz cd and then gave up listenin cuz it soundz so pop. Now Mr. Petey has joined the bubblegum rap club and will make money from theze brainless teenz. Seriously mane...I cant believe most people are not realizin that rap haz changed into pop or R&B.;To tell yall sumthin...when you look for a so call new rap album (like nelly, ludacris, lil jon...etc) at amazon...what is alwayz related to that item is that Usher cd and Usher aint a rapper and that album your lookin at aint rap muzik...lol!!! Inna couple months...Justin Timberlake will be related to every bubblegum (or you teenz can call it...""gangsta"") rap album...You brainless teenz make me laugh!!! :-))Helpful votez are gonna be 0 out of 1,286,532 cuz teenz wont get it thru their thick stupid headz...lmao!!!"
1,Petey Pablo was good in his time.,Petey Pablo was good in his time. NOt anymore. He should stay retired. Stupid freekleak is barely a song. ITs barely 2 mintures long. 2 mintures isn't song. 3 mintures is song.his album gets 1 out of 5
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT","This is a pretty average album. The best songs are: ""Part 2"", ""Did You Miss Me"" Featuring Baby & TQ, ""Jam Ya'll"", ""Freek-A-Leek"", ""O It's On"" Featuring Young Buck, ""Get On Dis Motorcycle"" Featuring Bubba Sparxxx, ""U Don't Want Dat"" Featuring Lil' Jon & ""Vibrate"" Featuring Rasheeda."
4,Off Tha Chain,"Aight this cd is off tha chain, after the first album he was gone along time but now he's back and its grazy, With Big producers like Timberland, kanye west,Lil Jon and more. He still rappin tha Dirty Dirty style and it sounds very good. The Number Jam Ya'l and O Its on with Young Buck are the most finest but the rest is also very good!!!!Big Up To My dogz in AA and DNCK whut up!!!!peace out!"
3,"Good series, disappointing conclusion","I first read World of Tiers books in 1974, and enjoyd them over the years. As a whole, I would have given the series 5 stars, yet this one only rates 3.The basic plot is that Kikaha and Annana have been tryng to escape from some universe for 15 years, and when they finally do, they meet up with their arch enemy, Red Orc. Farmer does bring the series to an end, but I think it was very contrived.He does answer some questions from the earlier books, but I was left with the overwhelming question: why did I bother to buy the book in the first place?Saying that, it is worth reading to find out how the series comes to an end."
5,Best Collection of Kids Music,"We bought these CDs for our baby when she was just an infant because we wanted her to know all of the kid songs we grew up with. She is now almost a year old and we still play these CDs in both cars,and I am going to buy the download to have on the computer for using in the home. I enjoy listening to the music and singing along with the songs. I enjoy the grown up singers that do not ""baby-up"" the sound of the songs, or have kids singing,which tends to get annoying. My daughters all time favorite is wheels on the bus, which to this day calms her and usually puts her to sleep. My only disappointment is that ""you are my Sunshine"" is NOT on this collection!!!"
4,Good book,"I have had this book for a few years now and I love it. Hart gives lots of examples of a character in different situations. He also shows how to lay out your comic and gives advice on colors and such. This book /would/ have gotten the full 5 stars, but I felt that the section on animals could have either been expanded to include a basic rundown on construction for beginners, or left out entirely. The section is mainly about the relative height of animals to others and, above that, an intermediate construction of the animal itself, plus a brief written guideline. I should be getting Hart's book on cartooning animals today, so hopefully that will be more of a help to me in the animal area. All in all, this book is great for those who are just starting out or need a refresher."
4,Very Useful,This book was recommended in a class I was taking as a good reference for drawing cartoons. It came quickly and in great condition
1,Complete rip off - do not buy! Nao comprar!,"$25.00 for a 72 page book? What are the publishers thinking? What was I thinking when I ordered it? I expected a full-fledged cookbook, something with chapters and many recipes per chapter. There are exactly 18 recipes in this child-sized volume. I see on the back of the ""book"" that Lerner Books offers over thirty titles in this ""easy menu ethnic"" series. Incredible that they can sell so little for so much. It is the only title I have ever returned to amazon."
2,Pretty average,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is not great and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains some OK recipes but on the whole they seem a conglomeration of African and general South American dishes. Even the Feijoada does not look right and the deserts are sorely lacking that Brazilian richness.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
4,Forbidden Hope!,"'Alison Gregg accompanied a young orphan across the ocean to Canada, to the home of the child's only relative-her uncle, Graham Bennet.Encouraged to extend her stay by Graham, Alison readily agreed, for not only had she grown to love the little girl, but the handsome uncle as well.But as Alison came to know Graham's friends she realized that two other women were in love with him too, and her hope of winning him was just as forbidden as the picking of the trillium, the province's official flower. Still, she could not put him out of her mind or out of her heart.'This was a very confusing book, Graham moved Alison and little Cheryl from one place to another without telling Alison what he was doinging or why."
5,All-Time Favorite,"This album has been number one on my all-time favorites list for many, many years. Nothing can top it.Tony Carey is so ahead of his time on this one that it's astounding. Some of the sounds are absolutely haunting, while others inspire joy and hope, while still others impart great sadness.Pink World is a ""rock opera"" that tells the story of a young boy named Artemis (or Artie) who drinks some toxic water from a polluted river. He gains super-human powers and builds a ""zone"" (or ""barrier"") to shield his followers from the nuclear holocaust that occurs. His oasis proves not to be much of a sanctuary, however. He employs cameras and strict security tactics to keep his followers in check. He ends up vanishing at the end, a ""little pink pool"" the only trace of the once omnipotent Artemis.Buy Pink World, you will not be disappointed."
4,Believe in the Pink,"A must listen for progressive rock lovers.Tony Carey did some more pop oriented stuff under his name in the 80's (pays the bills), but Planet P Project allowed him to explore his more creative side.The album `Pink World' has a post-apocalyptic sci-fi vibe to it that will have you sitting and listening to it for hours."
2,Organ Donor's on Wheels,"I wasn't sure what I was getting, but it looked intersting. The box indicates many form of extreme motorsports, but it is 90% crotch rockets with idiots destroying perfectly good tires for a minute smoke, and trashing expensive bikes, while endangering other bystanders..It is truly amazing what these guys can do on bikes and bounce back for more. I remember driving the interstate through Chicago when this loud roar comes up from behind and passes us going at least 90mph. About a dozen bikes pass with 3-4 doing wheelies. I immediately decide that if one goes down, I'll just have to run them over. I wasn't about to risk my life and my passengers lives and the lives of others, by swerving. This movie depicts illegal, exceptionally dangerous behavior which should not be attempted by anyone."
5,Life Study Of Pentateuch,"I have read many books filled with personal religous opinions and emotional illusions to try to convence the reader of his or her religion. I found the writings of Mr. Lee both facutal and enlighting to my spirtual desire to seek God. This book is not about cults or how to be in cults. Everything I read is in the bible, in sripture. In fact Mr. Lee sights his reasonings from scripture. As someone who has studied over 150 religions I belive I have some idea of the reality of these writings. Any person who is a follows Jesus Christ will only enhance there growth in Jesus Christ by reading his books .Thank you. A reader in Arizona."
1,Oh no! Not another cult!,"... This is perhaps the worst bit of writing ever to blight the English writing. At best, it tells nothing new of the Bible. At worst, it leads the reader down the darkling path to a cult-trap.Lee is obsessed with bitter hatred of God's finest creation: man. Lee preaches the complete destruction of all of human nature, especially his mind. The goal is the loss of the human soul. Lee preaches when the human body is removed of its soul, the spirit of his god will move in, producing a god-man. Demon-possession, no less!He tells each cult member how to do it.This expensive series is a first step to soul-death. It also is important source of funds for Lee's church, the Living Stream Ministry, and its Local Church subsidiaries.Read Chuck Palahniuk's _Survivor_ instead!"
5,If you love Vincent Price you will love this great book,"When I was a kid way, way back in the late sixties to the earlyseventies I never failed to catch a great Price film on the late night Creature Features. This book is hard to put down.Dennis Meikle does'nt white wash the Master of Menace, nor present him in any unfavorable light. All of Price's successesand failings are told here in a very respectful manner. As amatter of fact there were some parts of Price's life I did'nt want to know. This is the story of a great actor the likes of whom we will never ever see again. Well illustrated. A reallyexcellent book."
4,Helps a bit,My dad has various health issues and takes tons of tablets a day. He is severely constipated most of the time. He says this tablet helps him slightly. I am speculating it will helps other pretty well if it helps my dad even slightly. 4 stars as there is not sudden change for my dad.
2,Didn't work for me,"I was taking a medication that completely stopped up my digestive system, so my doctor recommended these for me. I noticed no difference at all. The doctor told me to then take the maximum recommended dose on the box, still no difference. I highly recommend a polyethylene glycol or a milk of magnesia product, those worked very well for me.On the plus side, I had absolutely no side effects."
5,Stool Softner,I don't travel without these! They are great at keeping one regular without being a laxative.I recommend these highly.
1,Another mindless vanity biography,"I fail to see what on earth a fourth-rate soap opera actress like Hunter Tylo has done in her life to warrant an autobiography, much less a pseudo-frank, self-pitying, narcissistic pile of swill like this one. Only fans of the pretty-but-vapid actress will find anything interesting in this amateurishly written piece of junk. While her daughter's cancer is terrible, Hunter seems more intent in getting pity (and attention) for herself than for the afflicted child.The account of the Spelling trial conveniently neglects to bring up an important point: Hunter was fired because she disregarded a stipulation in her contract where she agreed she wouldn't alter her appearance--something she most certainly did by getting pregnant. Sorry, Hunter, business is business, and portraying yourself as a victim of pregnancy discrimination when you're actually a victim of your own carelessness won't change it."
2,Not Enough Warmth,There are two things about this book that disturbed me immensely. One is the quality of writing - which I could get over - but the other is how self-involved she is throughout the book. The latter I could not get past. I was disappointed and saddened.
4,She is NUTZZZ,"Boy do I feel differently about this actress after reading this book! I gave it a 4 because it reads in a Jerry Springer sort of way where you can't turn the channel, or in this case the page, because you can't believe what you are seeing/reading! First of all, she abandons her kids REGULARLY throughout her life (I don't care what her great excuses were), the one son is near suicide (umm, ya think?!), and don't even get me started on her journey to and affair in a foreign land (hubby should have kicked her to the curb for good then and there!). Finally, the childish way she spins tales about another actress was in my opinion defamation of character and in poor taste. I don't care what reborn crap she is trying to pull now, she is a mess and has put herself first her entire life. Doesn't her TERRIBLE new face and lips scream ""LOOK AT ME!!!"" We're looking alright and running the other way!!!"
3,"A touching book, by a surviver","Hunter Tylo is a soup actress, not an author. Therfore, whoever wrote that the writing is too low is just a poser. you could have chosen to read Jamer Joyes if you are looking for for high literature. Hunter learned from her experience and found a new way to live her life. I want to encourage her for being such an overcomer. I hated the religious part,tough. As a jewish, i can't identify with her disregard of oter religins. She could have,instead,described a more encompassing experience. This part with Jesus blood is sordid. Overall, this is a nice book, for whoever doesn't have unreal expectations from an actress's biography."
1,It's All Been Said,"I was shocked and appalled by this book, then saddened. The only thing I would add about this book is that the writing is poor."
5,Good Christian Reading,"I am a 42 year old wife, mother, family physician, and most importantly, a ""baby Christian"". As such, I am continually fascinated by fellow Christians' testimonies. I loved reading about Mrs. Tylo's coming to faith. Her pre-faith marital, financial, and professional trials and tribulations--most of them self-inflicted-- parallel what many of us ""late believers"" have gone through. Her spiritual journey takes the reader to a third world country where false gods are worshipped, and it quickly becomes apparent from the book that this land is likely also demonized. I was both inspired and encouraged by Mrs. Tylo's coming to faith story, and will be recommending this book to family and friends, Christians and non-Christians alike."
1,Don't Want To Judge But...,"I try never to judge others, but Hunter Tylo has put herself in a position to be judged by writing this book about herself. END"
1,Good Book but Paperback is not Good,"I can't believe they made a huge thick expensive book that is only made by Paperback. They should create a Hard Cover because I always carry and drop my Emergency Care during training and Emergency that can ruin the book easily. In regards to the CD, the CD has lack of information. I am expecting that the CD composed of all chapters that is detailed so that students can learn in reading and listening from the CD.The book has a lot of useful information. However, the CD has lack of informations and the durability of this book is weak."
1,Robbed!!,"I have owned a Tracfone for 3 years with OK service which included lots of ""no service"" areas across the US. This month they stopped serving my Nokia phone without notifying me. After trying to use the phone I called their customer service tech reps and after 1 solid hour on the phone they told me that due to age they were no longer servicing that phone. I will have to buy a new phone and a $20 activation card before they will transfer my 852.5 minutes (worth $130) to the new phone.Their service reps are from Columbia and Bolivia and they hung up on me twice when I insisted on talking to someone from the US.I don't want to purchase a new phone plus 20 minutes and then have them cancel my service again???"
4,Nice phone if you have light cell phone usage,"I have been using tracfone for about seven months. The signal is good no matter in the city of Boston or in countryside of PA. Compared to other prepaid services, I would say this one is the cheapest. And you get 120 free minutes if you get invitation from others before activation. Let me know if you need an invitation."
2,Not My Favorite,"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Insp. French books but thisone to my way of thinking was almost to the point of boring.Way, way too much time was wasted on the trial of the twomain characters. Also I had always assumed that in all mysteries,true and fiction, the police had to consider every characterinvolved in the story no matter how unassuming they might beto the case. In every criminal case they must investigate everypossibility no matter how unimportant it might seem. I justseem to not have had the required attention span for this one."
4,Brenda Lee,"To start off the video wouldn't play on myplayer, so I have to play it on my computer. Not the best way to view a video. Her singing is teriffic but the lighting was awful as some of the scenes were in semi-darkiness. I would hope she can come out with a better DVD in the future."
5,excellent quality for the price,I was surprised how good quality this cover is. I bought for the heater and this barbecue cover I used for a wicker side table which was perfect.
4,Good for more than a Kettle Grill...,"I just bought this cover at a very reasonable price for the purpose of a dust cover. But not for a grill. There is a real lack of covers for all kinds of equipment, tools, garden stuff, etc. This product works great for my ""pancake-air-compressor"" to keep grease and grime off when not in use. I just wish this company would not restrick their covers to just yard stuff...full size compressors, band saws, tablesaws, drill presses, cutoff saws, AC units would all benifit from this type of cover...you get the idea...Expand your inventory...there is a Big Market out there.. Most of the people I know that are in the need of such covers have to have them made by boat cover guys at great expense. At the very lease... a couple of universal covers would go a long way."
5,Bare Naked Bearnaise,"Incredible! Worth every penny and then more. I've had Bernaise in fine restaurants in Montreal, Chicago, San Francisco and this is in their league.Swoony on grilled tenderloins. And you only need a dollop so it's really quite inexpensive -- usually six servings per $6.50 jar."
3,instructions with assembly,"the price is a good deal, however the instruction manual was very poorly written. it took me 3 hours to hook the basketball hoop up. the instructions were confusing and not easy to follow. Other than the poor instruction manual, my girls age 5 and age 7 really enjoyed having the basketball hoop outside."
5,Great Buy!,"The shipping was free and fast! I recieved my hoop in about a week! I love it! It was easy to assemble, took me about 2hrs. I enjoy using it everyday!"
5,Lifetime 1221 Pro Court Height Adjustable Portable Basketball System,The product received was as advertised. Easy to assemble. Has withstood wind gusts. The system has been used by young and old alike. Well worth the investment.
5,great for the price!,great for the kids in the cul de sac we live on. lasted great in the hot sun - no leaks or breaks so far. thumbs up!
4,overall good product,"Good value for this item, found it more difficult to put together than stated and can not adjust the height while playing or when the hoop is upright, would actually have to lay it down which is trying if it is filled with sand or water. My son does love it, seems pretty sturdy so far. We had to buy some additional screws as the ones we were provided do not work with the everyday layman's person tools. The directions are horrible, but can be figured out. I think it is just right for a child 10 or younger, my 6 year old loves it and is having fun. . ."
4,Nice Goal for the Price,"Purchased this goal after Christmas on the clearance sale. Really nice price and my daughter loves it. The back board is a little small, but who can complain with the clearance price and free shipping."
1,Missing Tools,"I received my package and all tools and net were missing. I will probably return entire product and just purchase in store. DISSATISFIED. I attempted to call the customer service and was also dissatisfied. They wanted proof of my order with Amazon which I emailed promptly and they still have yet to reply and mail the missing parts, nuts bolts and net."
1,You get what you pay for,"I know it's cliche but you get what you pay for. The name lifetime only stands as a brand name as this product didn't last but a few minutes. After assembly which was relatively easy excluding the backboard connectors which don't stretch out the way they should, as I went to get the water hose to fill it up it for no reason at the backboard ripped away for the connectors bring the whole court done and forever ending it's lifetime. If you want a decent backboard system, $100 is obviously not going to get you any quality. I'm going back to my spalding that took a tornado to tear it down."
3,ok quality,"It's not expensive, I give it that, but the plastic is way too thin where screws tighen, especially the backboard. And the base HAS to have some weight either on it or in it, otherwise it can tip over very easily due to the inherent in-balance. The rolling wheel mechanism should also be secured by bolts and nuts instead of a shaft rolled into grooves. Otherwise it does its job, but never try to hang onto the hoop, the whole thing will break. I didn't bother to fill the base with water or sand and simply placed something heavy on it, but one time it was removed by accident and the stand fell forward. The V-shaped bracket behind the backboard promptly broke free from the bolt/nut secured to that thin plastic wall of the backboard. My mistake, but really wish it is built with higher grade material, or reinforce the nut area better or simply add thickness around that area."
2,Complicated Assembly,This product is a little wobbly but OK since we've put it up. The problem is putting it up. We went backto the store and hired one of their assembler.
3,Great for Young Beginners,"This portable backboard system seems to be a good value for the money, and is great for young beginners, especially because it is adjustable. With free shipping from Amazon, it was a great value."
3,Kids Love It,"A lot of a pain to put together the instructions are not that elaborate and the pictures kinda suck, but once it was together the pain was over. My two boy use it every day and thinks its very cool when daddy comes out to play."
3,easy to install,Product is easy to assemble but very hard to level. Rim and back board do not align very well. Find for little kids just starting but will not be effective for long.
4,Good equipment for the price,Assembly was not dificult and my grand children love the 1221 Pro. The 1221 Pro is a good all around basketball set up for the beginner.
2,"Bought this for father's day, ending up selling it on craigslist for $40","I wish I would have spent a little more and bought one with the adjustable arm, versus this one, which requires you unscrew the knob. I am unable to lower or raise this alone. It is easy to move around the driveway, even with the base full of water (or sand)."
4,My son loves it,I bought this product for my son who is 7 years old. He enjoys it almost every day. One good thing is it provide several height adjustments. I myself started playing along with my son. One thing troubled me is the assembly instructions. It has no descriptive instructions and you got to be careful while unpacking the accessories.
2,Cheap Material!,"If you ask yourself, why this product is cheap, it is just because of very cheap material. 2 broken screws and not a good engineered product!If you can effort another and more expensive one, just go for that."
4,Decent,"It was simple to put together. My only complaint is that it's very difficult to lower or raise the goal with only one person. Otherwise, great buy."
5,Nice!,This portable system works perfect for the kids and the driveway. Very well made and and good looking for the price. Just beware that it really requires two people to assemble.
5,Game on!!,"This was a great product for the price. I put it together by myself, but needed a neighbor to help me stand it up, since I couldn't get enough leverage on it. I filled it with sand instead of water. It did take forever to fill but worth the effort. I live in a windy area in FL and do far no problems. The whole neighborhood uses it."
3,Ok basketball hoop,"I purchased the lifetime 1221 pro court basketball hoop it came when it was promised, the only problem I had was it was shipped with two of the same backets that hold the hoop up. I called the customer service department the same day and they shipped it out that day with a three day turn around. They gave me no problems. I recieved the part three days later and finished putting the hoop together. It was pretty easy me and my 67yr father put it together. My son which is 10 loves it. It is a good starter hoop"
4,"good value, easy assembly","This hoop is an excellent value for the money. I was able to assemble mostof it myself in less than an hour, just needed my teenager to help on the stepwhere you have to put the hoop and backboard on the pole in 1 step. I filledthe base with water and it was very stable even when we had 30mph storm.The backboard itself does vibrate a little compared to a fixed board, but forthe cost and for casual hooping it serves its purpose well."
5,Great Value,"This product was shipped promptly. It was easy to assemble, seems durable.Kids love it.Height adjustment is a bit cumbersome, but for the price, it's easy to put up with.If you anticipate no height changes, this one's a no brainer for the price."
3,Adequate for the price.,This product arrived very fast after ordering. We got it for a great discount at just under $100.00. The product is a little more difficult to assemble than you might think. Two adults are needed and it will take you about 2-3 hours to put together. The instructions are not that great. The only real complaint is the quality and size of the backboard.....but we knew that would be the case at this price point. Overall the unit should serve our purpose....an entry level hoop with some adjustment for height. Note: it takes two adults to make height adjustments. If this is not a concern or if you know you will likely keep the hoop at one height...go for it! There really isn't a better deal out there.
5,Well worth it,"We bought this for our six year old. It is perfect. The set up was certainly a two man-job. But, my wife and I were able to do it. My son loves it. Like the other reviews - it is impossible to pour sand into it. Also, I'd recommend that you adjust the height of the rim prior to set up. The directions don't tell you to do this.But, for the money - you can't beat it."
2,Hardware store needed,"The Lifetime Pro appeared to be the perfect gift; stylish, portable, and adjustable.....until I began putting it together the day prior to Christmas.The necessary parts/sizes needed to asure the structure is safe and secure were not included. Therefore, as long as there is a Home Depot close you will be good to go, however, I suggest putting your goal together long before you will need it, to make sure you are not missing something even more signifigant."
4,Simple and yet sturdy,The product was really easy to put together. It does take about 2 to 2.5 hours to get everything together. The pictures with the instructions were a little vague. My son loves his new goal and I recommend this system.
3,Inexpensive quality,This basketball hoop definitely for a small child. It not for aggressive play because of the location of the pole. Assembly works best with two people.
3,Daughter bought for my grandchildren.,This was a Christmas present that I did not purchase. I am sure it is fine or my daughter would have let me know. It came to my house when delivered and it was rather heavy so it must have been pretty good quality.
4,incredible deal exceeds low expectations,"Exceeded my very low expectations. Works as intended, gave me a full size hoop in my backyard.. Kids love it.. Its fun for me. Rim and net are solid, backboards doesn't provide much bounce, took about an hour to put together... I did it myself, requires basic tools. If you just want a hoop this is great, if you want competitive tourny play, you're gonna need to pay for it. Great value overall. 4 stars because a very inexpensive hoop is only that good.. Very satisfied."
5,"Great product, great customer service","Item arrived on time, missing a small part which upon request was promptly shipped by seller at no charge. During assembly we got stuck and called customer service, whereupon we received prompt and helpful service and were able to finish assembly with no problems. The item works great and our boys love it. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
3,Okay for the price,This was okay considering the price. I do wish the backboard was sturdy because I am worried that it will not last very long.
4,Works for us,"I ordered this item from Amazon, since I couldn't find one locally. The only problem with it was putting it together. It really takes two people. However my son got it done. The instructions could be a little more clearer. Since it's up, everyone enjoys it. Thank you."
3,Good....not great,Purchased the basketball system for my son who likes to adjust the height of the backboard frequently. This product is difficult to adjust and took more than 2 people to assemble. Although put together correctly (finally) the rim tilts upward.
4,"Great for kids, height adjustment bit of nuisance","My kids are 6 and 9. They've spent many days now enjoying hoops with each other. Construction has been adequate for their use and I've been pleased. My only complaint is that the height adjustment is not as easy as I thought it might be. All in all, a good goal."
5,Basketball Fun,This was a very good purcahse. We had a portable goal for 9 years and I decided to get another for the boys. It was easy to put together and the kids are playing with it every day.
2,"Good, once you set it up","The middle pole did not fit inside the top pole as it is supposed to. My wife and I are both mechanically inclined, and it is clear to us that the pole was not manufactured to specs. Whoever packed the poles in the box knew they didn't fit properly, because they ""made"" them fit by reversing the direction of the poles when they packed them. I had to add WD-40 and stand on a tall ladder to pound down on the two poles to make them fit together (not an easy task!). Also, the two plugs to keep the water/sand in the base were made of cheap plastic instead of rubber and broke easily (minor complaint). The only reason I did not give this product just one star is because, once we got it set up, it's good for the price I paid. However, I can't give it more than two stars because many people could not have assembled the actual misfitting parts we received."
1,3 attempts and still cannot get 2 missing parts!!!,"The package arrived without 2 supporting brackets for the board. Tried contacting the company by e-mail twice with explanation for the missing parts. These are the only brackets to support the board. The company requests me to contact them by phone, which I tried and was waiting on a phone for about 10 minutes with no replay. I am wondering if I am ever will get the brackets...???"
5,Very solid,"This basketball system is very solid, and so far seems to be holding up well. It was a bit hard to put together but we figured it out and our girls love it! Right now we have the base filled with water, but will end up using sand. Like the fact that you can adjust the height as they grow. Over all, great system for the price."
5,excellent set,"Very impressed with this basketball set.It was quite easy to put together but as the instructions show, you need 2 people to complete the assembly.It is solid, ideal for 6-7 year old children and the price cannot be beaten."
1,Awful instructions,"My review is for the set up. I'll have to get back to you on durability as this took all afternoon to set up. The assembly manual is AWFUL. They go to great lengths to label all the parts in the manual...and stamp different numbers/letters on the actual pieces so what is the point? Two bolts and two washers are not even the right size. The assembly book is all pictures, very few are helpful, and no words. The tube inside tube packing tacked on twenty extra minutes for assembly. I realize this is a cheaper model but a gas tank type cap would have made sand pouring a whole lot faster. I have never had such a mess with assembly and have assembled far more complicated things. If you really don't like a kid's parents by all means give this as a gift."
2,Not at all Stable,"First, this product is hard to assemble. Secomdly, it's not at all stable. The back board is very weak.I would not recommand this product."
2,Does not wash dishes well,"There are a number of problems with this product:1) It does not wash dishes well.2) The wash cycles are too long for such a small machine: the shortest cycle is 70 min, and it's called ""rapid wash."" The longest, called ""normal wash"" is 130 min.3) The poor design of the crate in one area results in dishes dipping too low and interfering with the rotating spray arm. Thus, this area of the crate cannot have dishes placed in it and is essentially useless.4) The washer does not dry dishes. After taking the dishes out, they are still wet."
1,Not worth the money,"Bought this unit 2 years ago. Within a year the heat sensor failed giving an E3 error. The company sent a new sensor due to it still being under warranty which worked just until the product was no longer under warranty. Next, the front window began leaking which gave off a horrible high pitch sound. Next the pump began to leak. I called customer service and spoke to Mark who informed me that the pump would cost $50 and take 3 months to come in. After 2 years I can honestly say that this machine has be a waste of money and time."
1,do not buy,"I thought this purchase was a good choice. Unfortunately, it was not. The main issue is this product has not option to return. If for any reason, you need a different size or credit that is not an option either. Also, this dishwasher is cheaply made and runs for too long. The shortest cycle is 70 minutes. I am a new mom and have a small kitchen and thought this would be perfect problem solve for efficiency- the exact opposite. Think twice before follow thru with this purchase."
2,"unable to use due to ""low water pressure""","I lasted 3 years without a dishwasher but it was driving me nuts. Our kitchen is tiny so we got this EdgeStar countertop dishwasher. We might have got the Danby but it's only available in white and all our kitchen is black/silver so we got the EdgeStar.Had to go to the store to get an adapter to make this work with my type of faucet... no big deal. Plugged it in and it will work for up to ten minutes before shutting off and noting ""E1"", error message 1 ""taking too long to fill up with water"" which is likely a water pressure issue.I don't have any method to change the water pressure in my home so must return."
2,Disappointed,I loved this machine for the first 4 months--after that it has been nothing but trouble . It leaks from the bottom and from the hoses that will not stay tight. I have to put towels everywhere to stop from damaging my counter and floors. I bought a year contract to return and I am sending it back!
2,Frustrated,"I'm giving this product two stars rather than a one star because I'm cheering for it, but I'm really not happy with my purchase so far. I plug it in and it seems like it's going to run, but then it just starts beeping and beeping. No error, just beeping. I have yet to have a successful wash. I will call Danby on Monday, so I'll update this review when I find out more."
3,Fairly Good Product,"I bought this product because I paint my nails a lot and always have those little ""slips"" that happen to everyone. I tried this out and it does work, I just had to scrub more than I expected to. From the product information it appears that all you have to do is swipe once and the nail polish comes off, mine did not do that. I had to swipe it over several times before it came off my skin. Still a good product though."
5,Satisfaction Guranteed!,"This is a fantastic live compilation which brings out the best in WMO. Special Guest Dave Ellis (sax) appears on several tracks. His extensive musical experience (Charlie Hunter Trio, Ratdog, The Other Ones) adds a little pinache to this 6 member ensemble's very full, funky sound. Ellis appears on tracks Movin' Free, SLM, Hell Ain't For Me, Space and Brainchild. Robbie Helm (sax) puts in a guest spot on Thyme and Grass Skirt. Finishing out the disc are three tunes from Humpty's in Lake Tahoe, Colorblind, Demons, and Pack it Up that absolutely smoke! Buy this cd today!"
5,Loss for words...,"These folks were always great when playing live at Blind Melons in Pacific Beach many years ago. I'm just at a loss for words because there are many great elements to this bands playing and songwriting. The instrumentalists deliver a funky, gutsy groove yet with a jazz-like finesse---and then there is the singer...She's just incredible"
4,Works well with one caveat,"This worked perfectly as a plug and play. I used it with a PS2 controller. It gives you a smoother analog than the third-party Gamecube controllers, which is useful when playing games like Rogue Squadron II and III in tight places like the Death Star II core tunnels. The only problem is that the analog on the directional control is not the widest range available. So, hard banking is less effective with the PS2 than the gamecube, but it is more precise overall."
5,works for three,"works great. I use it mostly for my xbox because all of my original xbox controllers are broken. It has two switches, one is for switching between xbox or gamecube. The other is for switching between ps2 gamepad or ps2 wheel.I have also used it with the gamecube and the wii,and it works great."
4,"Great product, but only for DualShock 1 (PSOne Joysticks)","I bought it for using my PS2's DualShock 2 on my XBOX. Buttons are too laggy! This is a shame, because this is the third adapter I tried and there's a .25 seconds lag between button press and real action, just like the other ones.It works great on PS1 Dualshock 1 controllers though."
3,Too expensive,This item was too expensive for the quality it has... I just bought it because It was cheaper than buying controllers for my gamecube and xbox.... It seems cheaply made
4,Memorable melodies,"I enjoyed the music and thought that the melody hooks were really great - they definietly pass the ""can't get the song out of my head"" test. I give it 4 stars because I thought some of the songs were too long and repetitious - not sure why the title track was first...some of the other songs like Unrestricted Entity, Cousin Fran and Legendary Mama might have been better first track choices."
4,"no oscar winners, but nice instant move collection","i read the reviews of these set that they are cheap and unwatchable but all the ones i have are ok and play fine. sure some of this are not in the best shape but what did you expect for less than 25.00. as always some good ""b"" movies and some ""z"" grade films, but for the price a great way to build your dvd collection. don't expect ""gone with the wind"" but if you give it a chance you will find some gems here,enjoy"
4,50 pack is back,"i own many of these 50 pack collection and i enjoy most of them. this pack is no different. there are some good,some bad,and some that, well you'll see. as always if great transfers are what you want stay,but if you want some good old b-z grade films this is a great way to build a collection"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.","This entire DVD Box set is horrible.The only thing suspenseful about it is the picture and sound quality.Someone at Mill Creek Entertainment needs to realize it's 2010.Releasing terribly recorded VHS on DVD is not something we want to spend our hard earned money on.Most of the films are just unbearable to watch and not well made.Even the cover is way off.It features a middle aged Robert De Niro and the two film he's in, he's gotta be in his twenties.This set features a lot of films that are not even on IMDb.So you know they are terrible and forgotten low budget pieces of garbage.If you absolutely have to buy this, don't expect any ""classics.""You won't find any here."
3,ITS JUST FINE,IT'S WAS OK. IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE HORROR MOVIE COLLECTION BUT WORTH WHILE TO SEE IT.
1,Not so good,Perhaps I have become a bit spoiled by new tecnology. After viewing several of these movies I am not impressed.
1,Awful!,"I have not watched all of these movies, but considering the ones I have seen so far I don't know if I have the stomach for them. I am old enough to have seen many of these when they were released and now I know why I never heard of them. A big waste of time!"
1,VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY,Very poor sound quality. Entire scenes have garbled sound. No closed caption - of course - these are old movies that would be fun to watch if we could hear the words.I will update if we find movies that we can hear.Received this set mid May 2009.
3,50 Movies - Suspense!,"A great deal of fun in this. Some classic movies, many I had never seen. Not the big name movies, but with many big name stars. Overall, a great package for the price."
4,Great gift for a movie buff.,Many hours of great movies (and a few not-so-great) but definitely something for everyone. A great gift for the movie buff in the family.
3,not bad,"I am usually a big Millcreek fan. This particular set isn't bad, but it isn't great. There a a few TV edits in here, but a lot of the movies are pretty good. If you know what you are getting here, mostly 70s and 80s flicks, you won't be let down. Heck Cat 'O Nine Tails and Escape from Sobibore are worth the prise alone."
4,Suspense Classics,"The product is of good quality, actually quality you would expect from the older movies. My only disappointment was I ordered more than one movie pack; Box Office Gold, Suspense Classics and Best of TV Detectives. There were many, many duplicates. If I had only ordered one movie pack this probably would not have been a problem."
4,"At eighty cents per movie, you're getting your money's worth.","This is another ""pile-of-crap"" collection that rates four stars because it's an ~interesting~ pile of crap. If you look these movies up on IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find that only a dozen of them are generally considered good, and some of these are so bad that they're funny in a ""Mystery Science Theater"" or ""Fractured Flickers"" way. So, no, your average viewer should buy something else. But for those of us who enjoy movies for what could be called their historical insignificance, this is an essential collection."
2,Disappointed!,"I love Lisa Tucker's other books, but this one seems kind of formulaic or something, like she was trying too hard to write a ""serious"" book. I'm surprised that it's getting such great reviews because by the end of the book I didn't really care about the characters, and I never connected with any of them, and there are a lot. I think the author is wonderful but this book just didn't do it for me. Sorry! I'll still read her next one, though. I just hope she goes back to what she does best."
3,just ok,"i was looking forward to reading this book based on other reviews and the plot summary. i was bored during a large portion of the book and found myself skimming many pages. the author had an excellent idea for the novel, i just didn't feel it developed well (plot, characters, etc...)"
2,Blah,"The only interesting thread in this story was how the wife came to understand the husbands controlling nature and his tactics as she freed herself from it.I found the characters boring and without depth. I could make no connections with them.The ""Hollywood"" stuff was perhaps supposed to show how bad things could happen to the ""beautiful people"" class, too, but to me it was all banal.And the ending is silly; everyone ends up loving everyone despite everything and they all ride into the sunset, group hugs and all. Blah!"
1,"EW, EW AND MORE EW","ONCE UPON A DAY is a dark book containing dark subject matter and I thought it was a really unpleasant read. It's way too heavy and depressing without any relief save a smattering at the end. Everyone in the book is broken, shipwrecked, damaged. The girl Dorothea, is way too trusting and leaps into bed with the first man she sees (almost literally) and is set to marry him within an 11 day period (in her mind anyways). It's just too ridiculous! I'm not panning this book because it's not a light read I'm panning it because it's too grisly and relentlessly unpleasant. Even real life with it's irony and tragedy has moments of levity. This books is full of all kinds of yuck and ewwww factors and I didn't enjoy reading it. Therefore, I cannot recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"This one sounded really good to me, and Ipicked it up to read soon after it arrived at my door.Sadly, it dragged for me from the beginning. The ideafor the story was a good one, but it didn't deliver.It seemed clumsy and failed to flow, in my opinion.I kept reading because I kept hoping that the ending would makethe journey worth it, but that didn't happen. What reallyfinished it for me was that the ending was abrupt andfailed me as much as the story."
2,Unbelievable (and not in a good way),"The relationship between Stephen and Dorothea drew me in right away, until the sheltered Dorothea jumped in bed with him within a few days. Charles was so controlling that I wondered if he had orchestrated the attack on Lucy himself. After that, the plot is just muddled. I was hoping the novel would redeem itself in the end. It didn't. Charles ends up being a hero and poor Lucy the victim-again. How realistic is it to drive two characters to insanity, then to have everything turn on a dime, and all is forgiven? The only reason I didn't give this one star is that it kept my interest wondering how it would all turn out. The ending was unsatisfying and simplistic. Miss Tucker is capable of writing a better book than this."
5,Natural story teller enchanted me again,"Some things can't be taught. Lisa Tucker has the innate sense of how to tell a story. This is a rare art.This is the complex history of the O'Brien family discovering its past. Though each parent could have been button-holed by a clumsier author's hands, there are no heroes and no villians in this story. The darkness that is revealed at the center of the story is ultimately balanced with hope. Lisa Tucker is able to tell the truth about a world in which terrible things happen and we can all still find happiness."
1,once upon a day-never in our lifetime,"This, much heralded, book sets the work to empower women who survive domestic violence back several decades. It is another of the ""bad boy"" fantasies where a man who controls every move of his entire family, culminating in the kidnapping of his children, is finally forgiven by his wife and children, when the children finally reunite with their mother after 19 years of being held captive by their father and paternal grandmother. The children, ages 6 and 4, are abducted by their father after their mother is brutally attacked when resisting rape by home intruders. The father raises the children in remote AZ, where they have no contact with the outside world, under the guise of protecting them from the horrors of the world."
4,Very Engaging Read,We read this for our Book Club and everyone enjoyed this book. It was highly readable and told a good story! That alone made it a good pick. It also had interesting themes that lead to a good discussion about domestic violence...older husbands and loss and inpact of environment on development.
5,This is a workout for the heart!,"The characters in this novel are so well written that I found myself feeling anxious, laughing, getting angry, being appalled, and wishing the story wouldn't end. The premise for the book is so creative (think Lovely Bones), that I honestly could not predict what was going to happen next. I read this book in 2 days!"
4,Good overall,"I've bought this and other books in the series. As others have mentioned, they give a good overview of major European cities. The information is helpful and it covers a lot of ground.It can be a little cumbersome to carry around/use while abroad. In the past, I have had success getting the binding removed(you can do it at most copy centers i.e. kinkos) and making smaller booklets by stapling together sections that had a common focus. This way, you don't have to handle the giant manual to find an address and you can leave the parts you don't need at home.One thing to keep in mind is this series doesn't get updated as often as others. This book specifically was released February 1st of 2005. Because the information has been out there for a while, the info will be out of date and some of the places to stay/eat could be pretty busy with others who bought the same book. Just something to keep in mind."
5,"Great guide for low-budget travelers, albeit a little big and heavy!","I had no idea how big this book is. It was the heaviest item on my after-college backpacking trip to Europe, hands down. But what it lacks in portability, it makes up for in comprehensive, well-written information for the low-budget traveler.My only complaint: the maps are sometimes hard to read, and local maps will often give you a better, caricatured look at the landscape."
3,Lonely Planet Europe,"For massive information pre-europe travel, this book can help with planning, sites, fair amount of maps, eating and drinking sites for many european cities.Pros: Based on budget travelling so you receive good info on affordable places. Multiple maps, where to go, what to do.Cons: small print, book is bulky and can't lug to Europe very well. Covers maybe too much in one book....3 stars, good Europe planning guide."
4,Great Guide Inside!!,"This book is really useful. However, the problem wih Lonely Planet in general is that you need to buy he most updated version everytime because things change and the lonely planet people know this. And they keep updating it.Luckyly this edition is the newest one because it has the wedding of prince of denmark in it which is pretty recent.All in all this is an excellent bok!"
4,A gut-wrenching account of wilderness survival.,"Hamilton does an excellent job of describing the physical demands of a pack trip into a mountain wilderness.Reading his detailed account, a person can almost feel the unforgiving weather and participate in the bruising, torturous trek through the mountains.Add to this the indecision, moral dilemmas, and complacency of the hunters and your in for a great read.The fact that this was a true story really kept me in awe."
4,Echo Valley Hiking Gnome,"This is a smaller gnome but has a great deal of detailing. It has a small solar panel on the back side. The light may be small, but at night I can even see it from the house."
4,cute,Cute lighted gnome is lovely. I have had it for about a year now. Light still works but as other people have stated the paint does fade and it does chip away. Still cute enough to be very glad I have him!
3,Be warned,"I bought this little guy & he looked & worked great. But I also bought two other (much cheeper) gnomes from walmart at the same time. The paint on the walmart gnomes still looks like it did when I bought them - well over a year ago. But the paint job on this solar gnome has completely washed out. The only color left to him is his hat (still much faded)the grass at his feet, and the butterfly. His once red shirt now looks grey, his staff, face, and all the muchrooms have faded to white. So if you buy this gnome anyway, I would suggest spraying him (careful not to spray the solar panel on back) with a clear ""outdoor"" acrylic sealant - about twice a year. And, strange as it may sound, try to keep him out of direct sunlight as much as possible - unless you dont care if the paintjob fades."
1,Not as expected,"The gnome is cute, but very small. The height was not given in the description and if I knew how small it is I wouldn't have purchased it. Also, it said it could withstand the outdoors, but the paint on the hat peeled off after one rain."
3,Its....... okay,"It definitely helps and has cut down on our ball chasing time, but it doesn't ""return"" as well as a bigger one we've used and if the angle isn't right, it doesn't work. For the price, its still worth it."
1,false advertising,"Even though the product packaging clearly states ""fits all home rims"", if you call Spalding because it will not fit your rim, you are told that it fits all SPAULDING rims. Since I bought it through amazon and was over the return deadline, Spaulding told me there was nothing they could do, since amazon had their money, they couldn't refund it to me!!"
4,Didn't fit,I am sure this would have been great if I could get it to fit on our breakaway rim. I am disappointed that it didn't work.
2,"no, back atcha","Too flimsy to really return balls, tends to dump them at the base of the pole. My kids took it off after a month."
3,Almost 4 Stars,"I really enjoyed the last entry in this mystery series but this one fell a little flat. I noticed that, similar to the earlier books, there were some phrases repeated a few times that makes it a little repetitive. However, the mystery itself is interesting and, having lived in Indiana for a few years, I found it nice to recognize some placenames, etc.In this entry, Jessica is a visiting professor at a small private university in Indiana. While there, a tornado strikes and leaves a professor dead; but was he truly killed by the tornado, or, as Jessica suspects, was there foul play involved? The mystery is wrapped up nicely and I found myself staying up late one evening to finish it. Looking forward to the next entry."
2,Not that good or interesting...,"This was not worth the 7.99. the story is not interesting. The writer was pretty lazy here and I think needs a break after ""writing"" 38 books in the MSW series.Jessica is pretty wacky in this, she actually asks someone where they were at the time of ""death"" before the ""death"" is even rerealed; really poorly done. I guess i will finish reading this junk but wish I could trade it. Most of the MSW books are great, the best of course are set in Cabot Cove, but some are great out of it (Savannah etc.)I wouldn't waste my money on this, unless u find the paperback in a used bookstore for a buck or two."
5,Excellent CD!,"This is a wonderful CD. It is both fun and restful, and I can identify with so many of the songs, like ""Small Piece of You"" and ""Prayers for this Child"". Sara Groves is an amazing song writer and after realizing how busy children make you (my daughter is 6 months old) I think it is amazing that she could write and record this CD while being mommy to 2 kids!I highly recommend this for any parent. Enjoy!"
4,"A difficult, but highly recommended read:","If you are a stutterer, or you have an interest in speech pathology and desire to learn more about stuttering, this book is an interesting place to start. Now, granted, it is not an easy read for the layperson, and it certainly does not discuss issues of indivudal stuttering concepts, but if you want a history, if you want to read about different strategies welcomed in the past, and if you want to learn a little about those famous people who have endured through many uncomfortable situations of ""tongue-tied-ness,"" grab a copy of this book!Keep in mind though, that if you're looking to learn about the causes and therapies and in-depth experiences with stuttering, this book will not fulfill that venue. This is a book on history and the interesting and absurd methods of ""curing"" the stutter that were utilized. At any rate, if you are a stutterer and you want to see that you're not alone, please pick up a copy of this book. :o)"
5,What a ride!,"For anyone who has ever lived, visited, or been fascinated with the idea of living or visiting Egypt this book has wonderful insight. As an avid reader of books about different cultures and an Expat myself, I found the book to be honest and entertaining as well as informative. A page turner from the beginning, Jeanne had me hooked and wanting to read more. The descriptions are vivid and reading this book puts you right in the middle of the adventure. This is a great discussion book for groups and clubs!!!"
2,mish kiteer,"While one does learn something about life in Egypt and its culture, the writing style is grating. Here's an example after the author is visited by a male doctor: ""While I was touched by their concern over my health, I was also spitting mad. I felt violated. Here it's assumed you're doing something wrong until proven otherwise! On top of that, phone cards haven't been available for nearly a month. Mo's mobile calling card had no minutes left on it. Neither did mine. While he could receive calls, he couldn't make any. He was leading a tour and had no way of reaching me. Being an Egyptian man, he was close to hysteria.""(p.96)According to Eck, Egyptian men are very emotional and cry easily. She on the other hand often feels violated and ready to slug somebody. (pages 95 & 102)"
4,An American in Egypt,This is a fabulous read written from the heart. Jeanne Eck has written about daily life in Egypt through the eyes of not just a tourist or an academic but as one person who has made her home there. She has taken risks in her life and is not afraid of exposing and sharing the good and the uncomfortable. Her writing makes Egypt and her experiences there come alive.
5,Happier After Reading This Book,"Very few American women decide in their middle age to sell their house, leave the city where they've lived for years and move to a foreign country. Even fewer decide on a country with wildly different cultural traditions. But Jeanne Eck did just that, after visiting Egypt once and finding a piece of herself there that required further exploration. This book describes her journey, her adventures, her friendships, her discoveries and her frustrations. It does so from a unique, personal perspective that brings the reader directly into the heart of her experience. In addition to revealing a culture most Americans know little about, ""I Am Happier to Know You"" will, hopefully, inspire many to pursue their own ""mad"" longings."
2,Not as expected,"At a glance you think the tire depth is also digital but it actually isn't. Part my fault for not reading everything therefore why,I rated as a 2 star....otherwise it would be 1 star"
1,Don't waste your money on this junk,The battery is soldered so you can't even change it. It lasted less than a year in my case. Dont waste your money on this garbage!
1,A problem with the battery?,I read where this item has a lifetime lithium battery warranty. So there should be no problem!!!!! Just return it. Right??
2,Lasted over two years,"This gauge seems accurate, it gave similar readings to the other gauges I own. The downside is that it doesn't seal to the valve stem well, so that one is tempted to apply maximo pressure. However, sooner rather than later, the head of the unit will break from the body (only make of plastic). More frustrating, that area can crack before it fully breaks, so that one is getting artificially low readouts (so one applies more pressure, and ""crack""!). Also, for motorcyclists, I prefer to place the wheel so that the valve stem is around 9 or 10 o'clock, so I don't have to stoop so far, and I can use my other hand to place the head firmly on the valve stem. But then, one can't read the LCD. For on the road use, a metal pencil gauge is less fussy."
1,tire gaiuge,"I purchased this tire gauge last year opened it today and it doesn't work, how do I get it replaced ?????????????"
5,Tire gauge w/ tread depth gauge,The tire gauge and tread depth gauge works very well. It is nice having both in one unit making it easier to carry one tool around. The digital read out for the tire pressure is easy to read. The tread depth indicator is okay for the small size. I don't think there is anything that would work better.
4,Good cooling but a little noisey,This fan provides good cooling for my AMD and is quieter than some fans I have used. The fan does not have PWM (pulse width modulation) and so the fan speed cannot be controlled to reduce the noise further (you also must have a motherboard that is PWM capable). I have been using the fan for more than 6 months (runs continuously) with no problems.
3,Another Dawn was o.k. - not great.,"I thought the book was too long. So many pages were filled with Banner or Jake agonizing over their feelings for each other. I agree with the reader who said that the way Banner convinced Jake to make love was wrong. However, I disagree with all the readers who thought Ross should not have died. He had been a criminal and killed people, include law enforcement. His dying words about being fortunate to have the time he did live with Lydia were true. And as other readers stated, Ross, Banner, etc. are FICTIONAL characters!"
5,BUY! BUY! BUY!,"I Love IT! Sandra Brown a Great Writter. Another Dawn is just one of her Many GREAT books.I Think Everyone Hated the part where Rose died ! I did ! I Cried because I read Sunset Embrance & How Ross Loved Lydia & Vice Versa! But i have to say this book is no dissapointment! It's as Great As Sunset Embrace But SE is still No.1. I have read it 5 X! Any lover of S.E must Buy this book as it tell u what happen to Ross, Lydia & The Langtons.I'm still waiting for a Story on Lee! This is a KEEPER!"
2,SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"This book is a spin off to Brown's SUNSET EMBRACE, which I loved. I was looking so forward to reading this sequel...only to be sadly disappointed and let down by the direction Brown took this story. To put it bluntly, I was sorry I bought it. It just proves that even the best of the best can make mistakes once in a while."
4,"Emotional Rollercoaster, but worth it","unfortunatly, I never got to read Sunset Embrace. But, I thought Another Dawn was riveting. I enjoyed the way Jakes consciences played on him about making love to Banner.,I also hated the fact that Ross had to die. Was that the only way to show Banner that Jake no longer held those feelings for Lydia? But anyway, my favorite part was when Jake asked Banner to marry him and had to tell her about the baby.l"
5,misery?,"Well, first I'd like to invite you customer reviewers to grow up. Sandra Brown is an author; she creates fictional stories how SHE thinks they will best read. She is the inspiration for the story; thus, the story is HERS. For all you who hated the story because Ross died, remember Stephen King's Misery? Does Kathy Bate's character ring a bell for you? Ross and Lydia are only CHARACTERS, no matter how vividly Brown's stories bring them to you. Certainly, I am no less an ardent fan of Brown and other novelists; I love to lose myself in the plot highs just as much as the lows. This book is no exception in its ability to captivate the reader. I recommend it to any of you who may be reading these comments."
2,Very dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed in this book. Jake aka Bubba has been in love with Lydia for the past twenty years. Where is there a 16 year old that falls in love and stays in love for twenty years? Banner was spoiled and selfish. The secondary characters were horrible. Priscilla wanted respectability when she was the one that wanted to become a... It kept going back and forth with Jake and Banner. They'd get along then they'd fight, etc... I thought that was unacceptable to this series. Overall it was a big dissapointment."
1,I should have listened to the others...,"I read all of the reviews here before reading this so I knew what was coming, but I liked SB so much that I thought it would be worth it. Wrong. It's because she is such a good writer that I care so much about her characters, and the ""surprise"" plot twist in this novel - even though I expected it - was so upsetting that it distracted me from the story of the main characters and I almost couldn't finish it. Ms. Brown must have known that her decision to include this would bother many fans - I wonder if she knew it would sour some of us on her work for good?"
1,"LOVE SANDRA BROWN, HATED THIS BOOK!","I'VE TRIED TO REVIEW THIS BOOK FOUR TIMES! I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG, BUT HERE I GO AGAIN! From the start I had probelms with this book. What Banner did to persuade Jake to make love to her was despicable. To use his feeling for her mother(Lydia) against him and ask him to use her(Banner) as a substitute? What kind of a self respecting lady would do that? I can understand that Banner was young and was in need of comfort, but she should have been woman enough to persuade Jake on her own. Then she makes Jake spend the majority of the book trying to convince her that he loves her and not her mom! As if that wasn't bad enough then Ross(her Dad) is killed. Was this so that the author could show once in for all that Jake only loved Banner? What a shame that Lydia would have to suffer so much because of an insecure selfish daughter. I HAVE LOVED ALL THE OTHER SANDRA BROWN BOOKS I HAVE READ, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS ONE WAS WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR'S EVIL TWIN!"
4,A good sequel,"I don't usually read historical romances, but after reading 'Sunset Embrace', I had to try 'Another Dawn'. I must say that the idea of an 18 year old girl and a man old enough to be her father was at first unappealing, but the romance between them was great. The love scenes were hot and I loved the development SB did with the secondary characters too! I felt for the Coleman family at the end and teared up a bit. If you like old west romance, then this is definitely a book for you."
2,It made me cry,"Why? Why, Ms. Sandra Brown did you have to kill Ross Coleman. I love him. He is the best. If there is any way to contact Ms. Brown there should be a petition that she rewrite this book. She must let Ross live. How can anyone dream of killing a man like him? Please, lets contact Ms. Brown and tell her that we hate that she killed Ross off, and would she Please, I am begging her to let Ross live. Lydia cannot be left alone in this world. Haven't she suffered enough in her youth to last a life time. It is not fair that she must see the man she loves die in her arms. That is the worst injustice ever. So, Ms. Brown if you care about your readers' feelings please think about rewriting this book and let Ross live and I guarantee that I will buy it if you write it."
3,Great Continuation of Sunset Embrace,"I enjoyed the continuation of Ross & Lydia's story as well as the new romance we saw budding between Jake and Banner. What I liked most about the book was the portrayal of strong family values and relationships between the characters. It was believable, sweet and occasionally romantic and suspenseful.I recommend reading this book only if you've read Sunset Embrace. It's worth it to catch up on the characters if you enjoyed them, although this novel is not as good."
1,The obsolete dictionary of a beginning of the ninetieth year,"The obsolete dictionary of a beginning of the ninetieth years. To type the stereotyped issuing for former central state Russian publishing house is simply of shame!I recommend newest and largest (3 Vol., 600 000 terms) English-Russian polytechnic dictionary of the Moscow publishing house ETS - ""Comprehensive English - Russian scientific and technical dictionary"". Edited by prof. V.V.Butnik, ISBN 5-93386-011-5. This dictionary is issued and as computer version - Polyglossum-dictionaries-family. The very convenient program. And book + PC dictionary - AAAAA+++++!"
1,Beware! Old dictionary 198? but stereotyped &copyr. 2000,"The is masked cheat! The dictionary is printed out of the diminished format. The font is very badly read. The interlacing of the book was disorganized in some days. I have rung up the director of RUSSO Publishing House Zaharov Galina. And I have not received the answers to my questions.... dodges, tergiversations and ruse...."
5,"Excellent Weber, good Beethoven; 4.5 stars","The ASMF is a major asset in the Weber-the textures of the chamber sized orchestra maximize the clarity of Weber's frequent wind-led themes. As a symphonist cusped between faux sinfonia concertante writing-with winds introducing and developing themes- and more rhapsodic romantic lyricism as in Oberon and Freischutz, Marriner is especially good at the wind music. He recorded the clarinet concerti twice-with Karl Leister and Andrew Marriner -and a disc devoted to bassoon works. However, he also responds well to Weberian romanticism. Sound is excellent.The Boult Beethoven overtures with the nee LPO are sufficiently dramatic and incisive //Boult's fine Berlioz and Mendelssohn discs. But here he faces enormous competition from Szell, Klemperer, Kempe and Jochum, and the sound is a bit dimmer then with the Weber. Conclusion-primarily for Weber mavens."
3,Ireland and the post-Roman world,"This book examines the fall of Rome and how the Irish, who were late converts to Christianity, became stalwarts against the darkness that enveloped Ireland. Their religious institutions led to the preservation of much of the classical works then in existence and Ireland, for a short time, was considered the source of learning in Europe, with Irish monks in high demand among feudal courts thanks to their piety and education.I think this book might have made a stronger case but it is interesting reading."
4,Extremely Well Done!,"Cahill's book is superb and despite what his detractors may say, this easy to read style may be instrumental in getting a broader spectrum of readers interested in his book and in the Irish. The chapter on St Patrick made me think of him in a new light...as the man he was as well as the Saint he became. Much better than the ridiculous statues of him in Green robes chasing the snakes with a shamrock. Mr Cahill has become one of my favorite authors!"
2,One chapter maybe worth reading,"After my recent trip to Ireland, my advisor recommended Cahill's book to me, so I ran to the store and grabbed one of the many copies of the shelves. ""What was America reading?"" I thought. ""This book must be great!"" Not only wasn't it great, it was greatly disappointing. My loves of history, religion, and Ireland were supposed to meld into beautiful prose and a well-woven story. Sadly, they did not, and there's only one chapter even worth reading (the one with the same title as the book). Much of the information attempted to be profound, but I found it to be a fairly superficial look at history and religion, and these two areas, especially in this case, deserve a better book than this one"
4,a history of the Irish,"This book being read by the fellow with an accent is the best. He is very capable and reads the Latin, Gaelic, French, etc., very precisely and clearly. I still did not know the words, but at least I could understand what he was saying.This is a history of the Irish, it just so happens that the Irish did preserve a lot of ancient literature which became an important part of our civilization after the Dark Ages. This history begins and ends with the sad review of the Irish in recent years, from 1800 to the present. The interesting part is St. Patrick's conversion of the Irish into Christians and how that became the basis of saving civilization."
1,Where did they find this narrator?????,"I am very interested in this subject and plan to purchase the book and read it. Though I love to listen to audio books I found this one so annoying that I had to give up after the first CD. The narrator is so in love with his own voice, and so overly dramatic, that by the time a sentence ends you have totally forgotten how it started and who was saying it! This is the first negative review I have ever written but I mean it from the heart: buy the book, not the tape or CD. You will lose your mind trying to listen to this pretentious windbag. It's bad enough in English but the book is laced with quotes and he has most excruciating Latin pronunciation I have ever ever heard in my life (5 years of Latin in my education!)."
2,And what of the Draft Riots?,"They may have saved ""civilization"" per se, but based on the Draft Riots, the role of the Irish in the history of New York City is a wee bit more complex (and I say this in all due respect)."
3,interesting historical read,"I read this book for my book club, so it is a selection that I would not have normally made on my own. It took a a little work, to delve into, and catch the mood. I had to read the first chapter twice and then I was hooked."
4,fun and interesting,This book really gave me a feel for WHY the Irish of the time saved so much of western literature when the rest of Europe lost it. Showing the different world views and the behaviors that came from them was what I found most interesting. The book is an easy read while having something to say.
4,Insights into Ireland,"The title always bothered me, but the content of the book was wonderful. I came to the reading with little knowledge of the history of Ireland. I came away with the story of St. Patrick, a glimpse at the Druids, a telling of early Irish Christianity and Literature. Entertainingly written. Highly recommended."
4,How Christianity Saved the Irish,"This thoroughly entertaining book is sometimes weak, sometimes strong in its arguments. The evidence to back them up can't always have been easy to find. Overall, though, a vivid picture comes through: of how life-giving Christian faith is; how it changes individuals, peoples...and civilisations"
3,Good for what it is,"As long as the reader remembers that Cahill is more of a journalistic or narrative writer than a historian, this book is a good choice. It is not entirely accurate, and makes the kind of inferrences and assumptions that the historian would never attempt. It is, however, a good read, with a fun and interesting plot. As long as you take it with a grain of salt, I would reccommend this book."
5,Thoughtful and thorough,"A classic reference on the the dfall of the Roman Empire and the history of Ireland, Viking and Norman Invasions, the deeds of St. Patrick Prehistory-19th c.. Cahill is an intelectual whose writing is full of toungue-in-cheech humor. Pleasant read."
2,"A muddled, meandering disappointment.","Cahill obviously loves to write stylishly and with charm, but lacks the organization to write a coherent history. He constantly seems to be guessing at the motivation of historical figures, rather than producing evidence of their actions. Add interminable quotations from sources that predate the actions he's describing by several centuries and the result is a shambles"
2,Worth Reading,"Cahill is a very skilled writer and many will find this a fascinating read. He is also a skillful researcher. Unfortunately Cahill seems to be unable to see characters outside of his twenty first-century context. He essentially ignores any evidence to the contrary (Historian John Bury for one) and describes Patrick as a devil may care schismatic. Then with the same myopic twist proceeds to paint Saint Augustine as a bitter representative of a dying religion. He bemoans the fact the Church has followed Saint Augustine, gleefully reports an instance of ceremonial bestiality, for some reason which only he is aware of, inserts gratuitous profanity, and insanely credits Irish piety as a chance to out ""Victorian"" the English. Still all in all the pluses out weigh the minuses and this book is worth reading."
1,A narrow-minded book,"A book that obviously endeavors to be pro-Irish but is in fact quite narrow in its appreciation for Irish Celtic heritage. In praising the literacy, ingenuity and key historic role of the early Irish Christians, the author also makes a number of cutting remarks about earlier Irish culture. It's a book that obviously considers the Classical (read: non-Celtic) to be the standard of civilization. Thus it presents a highly misinformed opinion of anything that relies on oral tradition, pagan religion, or a tribal government. As an historian I was excited to read about the accomplishments of the Celtic Irish, and instead I got the accolades of the Irish-acting-Roman. Doesn't seem to me that this is at all a credit to the Irish, but rather to the invasions--both military and cultural--which began the downward trend for Eire. The types of events that interest Cahill are as likely to have been root causes of Irish culture-loss as they are to have saved civilization."
1,Very over-rated,"This book is poorly written. It is historically inaccurate. The author seems to pick and choose his data. I looked forward to this book so much and was consequently so disappointed.In reponse to ""Spaniard"" above, the author clearly and repeatedly states that Patrick was a Roman albeit incomplete and not an Irishman."
1,Catholic doctrine masquerading as history,"This book purports to be about Ireland, but it is really about Catholic doctrine in Ireland. The historical material concerning the Roman Empire is already well known. There is some Irish history, but only as much as one reads in the lives of the saints. The title is misleading and the book, at least up to page 127 where I quit reading, is not worth buying. A one star rating is too high."
1,History Lite,"The author pads three-fourths of this little book with stultifying exposition on ancient history and a quickie intro to pre-Christian Ireland before getting to his thesis, which doesn't live up to the preposterous title. ""The Irish read a lot. They copied some manuscripts. Hooray for the Irish."" For perspective, the Arabs and Jews did far more to preserve Greek thought than the Irish ever did, but they don't even get a mention.It's too bad for Ireland that cruel, cruel fate chose the under-talented Thomas Cahill to introduce their cultural accomplishments to the world. His treatment reduces this area of Irish history to the level of a mildly interesting footnote.Maybe a historian will come along and give the topic the time and effort it deserves."
2,Not the best on this subject,"I first read this book a few years ago and then again recently. While it is written in an easy way and is a quick read I find that Cahill is not good at presenting recent scholarship or indeed in backing up what he is saying with references. Some of his ""facts"" are actually mythology but he does not state this and there is no clear line between actual Irish history and myth. In this he does a disservice to Irish scholars. I recommend that readers also read ""In Search of Ancient Ireland"" the more recent publication that gives a better overview of the same period in Irish history and with greater clarity and detail."
1,Assumes!,"Very good history, but the analysis presents a fictitious schismatic Celtic Church and beats the heck out of great thinker and saint, St. Augustine. Cahill brings his disagreements with the Roman Catholic Church to 5th century Ireland."
1,The unabridged audio is poor,"I won't weigh in on the merits of the work itself--it is fine for my taste, though not to others. But you ought to be warned that the narration for the unabridged edition, by Donal Donnelly, is deplorable. He reads with almost comically exaggerated vocal inflections. He often pauses after ever few words (sometimes after every single word) so that you can hardly follow the flow of the ideas. I found it so annoying that I had to stop listening, though I was engaged by the book itself. This criticism does not apply to Liam Neeson's reading of the abridged edition--I haven't heard it, but it seems to get good reviews. This is the rare instance when I wish I had bought the shorter version."
1,"In a word ""LUDICROUS!""","Very wishful ""revisionist"" thinking by Mr. Cahill. These books that the Irish monks merely copied, and never revealed or published for the world to truly broaden its knowledge, are akin to all the other monks across the mainland of Europe that did the same thing, yet revealed nothing to the public. It was the humanist Italian seekers of secular knowledge, during the early Renaissance, that uncovered these writings and most importantly made use of them, such as the Medici family that almost single handedly initiated the Renaissance. That is why Florence and Rome were pinnacles of the era, because this knowledge was UTILIZED in Italy, which clearly set the pace for other nations to follow. This is fact that cannot be revised by wishful thinkers. This is just a lame attempt to give monumental importance to a race, that although has many nice and humble traits, is insignificant on the colossal world-scene of Western Civilization."
1,WRONG! TRY HUMILITY.,"Does any thinking person truly believe that the Romans and Greeks needed far more primitive peoples to preserve their HERITAGE? Guess again! There is a mountain of evidence that a wide variety of peoples were maintaining the Classical Heritage. The Armenians, both the pre-islamic and moslem Arabs, Jews, Franks, Goths, Britons, Welsh, and obviously the Italians and Greeks. The Armenians were the first Christian nation by 80AD. Clearly, the Irish saved nothing since all of these other groups were at work long before St. Patrick was ever born. ""It is shocking how many of the positive reviewers Mr. Egolf, refuse to RECOGNIZE this fact! I'm half Scottish and I am keenly aware that Civilization in the Americas, Rome in the west to Japan in the east was doing great without the Scots. The Irish should have the same HUMILITY! This book is a sad Vanity Piece with no merit."
1,"OXYMORONIC TITLE, ABSURD PREMISE.","As a foreign exchange student I was shocked when I heard him speak at NYU. He even claimed that there was a conspiracy against his book. Talk about paranoid! Every time he did not like a question, he jumped to the next student. Exs: Where did the Irish get their books? There were other monks copying books? What about the Romans and Greeks, they and their cultures never vanished? How about the thousands of Arabs and Jews who built libraries wherever they settled? How about the scholars in the Roman and Greek Orthodox Churches? When did the big bad Germans destroy all the boooks? As a German I found his thesis very offensive. So too, should any other logical reader. This is bed pan history, and bigotry."
4,A interesting book that tells of monastic preservation,"I think this book was an interesting book. Cahill has opened my eyes to who the Irish are. I also learned about their personality and their literature. The little literary quotes he puts in there are interesting and charming and make me want to read some Irish poetry. Also, with his quotes from the Tain, it makes me want to read that book, seeing how the Iliad of Homer first got me into epic poetry."
4,"Informative in an entertaining way, a new look at the time.","Informative and entertaining at the same time. Worth the read, although a little too much reference to poetry for this technician, it did not distract from the overall work.Mr. Cahill did an excellent job of presenting this history of in a context easy to track and understand. Opened up a few doors for me and answered some questions."
4,A well written introduction,"I found this book to be utterly enjoyable from start to finish. While it should not be considered to be a fully accurate history of Christianity in Ireland, it is a lot better than most ""Celtic studies"" books that are out there. Cahill takes the facts, the stories, and the rumors of early Celtic Christian days in Ireland and presents them as history using his descriptive and enticing prose. The result is an easy to read, but entirly fasinating picture of Ireland. He focuses on the Celtic Christian monastaries' role in preserving the written documents of Western Civilization and makes a very good case for their role as preservers (savers) of that knowledge. Anyone with any interest in Celtic studies, Christian history, or Western Civilization should read this book."
1,Hideously researched and very biased. Don't listen to him.,"Cahill fails to cite almost any sources for his historical ""facts,"" and the few he does cite are either mistranslated or misquoted. The gist of the book is that the way in which the Irish saved civilization was by embracing Christianity. His definition of civilization is any Christian society; the surrounding Pagan cultures are referred to as barbarian hordes living in darkness till the light of God is thrust upon them. His point seems to be that Christianity took hold of Europe and the rest of the world largely because it managed to take hold of Ireland, but he fails to understand or tell us that Christianity was repeatedly rejected by the Irish, and that the older Pagan ways continued on for a VERY long time underneath a thin cover of Christian rule. In short, he Pagan-bashes like crazy and has the WORST historical methods I have seen in years of study"
1,FIVE NEGATIVE STARS!!!!!!,"This review is for all of the 1 Star reviewers who were insulted by the last reviewers comments. First, the 1 star reviewers actually reviewed this FICTIONAL PACK OF LIES. Second, every single one of them made good points. This woman was born and educated in Germany and trust me the Irish are not held in any regard, that is if they are even mentioned. The last reviewer like Mr. Cahill did not prove anything by his childish tirade. I for one am going to be signing any petition by any ethnic group that wishes to censor this hate filled book. Calling all German, Italian, Greek, Hispanic, Asian, and any other group that Mr. Cahill chose to attack. I for one expect that Amazon will remove my rev. Which is fine, only if they do the same for Mr. D's rev. Regardless, I won't be reading any more books by Cahill!"
1,Historically Inaccurate and Very Misleading,It's premise and it's title are false. It grossly overstates the disorder on the Continent at the time and grossly overstates the accomplishments of the Irish monks. One of the most rubbishy history books I've ever come across.
2,too cursory and not the best on this subject,"This was not as compelling or thoughtful as this subject deserved. It seems to be written (or transscribed) with the audiotape in mind. Cahill's statement in the preface that this subject (How the Irish Saved...) has not been addressed before is wrong. I recommend James Charles Roy's Islands of Storm. This is an earlier book and does a far better job of explaining this subject. In addition it adds far more Irish geography and meanderings about Irish religious development and influences. At 280 pages a far more worthwhile and enjoyable read. In fact after reading Cahill's, I immediately re-read Roy's."
1,Hinges Of Hate??????,"What's next, how the Irish built the great wall of China? How anyone with even a 4th grade education could believe that the Greeks and Romans needed others to preserve their ""rich heritage goes beyond all logic and reason."" The 3-5 star reviewers have unintentionally endorsed the bigotry and misinformation that the author spews throughout. How can any reader overlook it? Even some reviewers who share the authors ethnicity have expressed their disgust, like-""I'm Irish."" The author failed to mention that most of the Continental monasteries they founded barely lasted a generation. The locals understandably got fed up with their ""PARASITICALLY LIVING OFF THEM!"" The Benedictines were self suffiecent Mr. Egolf! Where did these saintly{HAH} monks get their books? Other more educated reviewers had to tell us since the author refused too! That in itself made this book stink of Lindberger! I hope Amazon dumps this into their bargain bin."
1,Any Irish/N. Irish schoolchild could have written this,"Very disappointing. Unfortunately, I fell for the catchy title. I felt the whole book's tone was summed up by Chahill's statement on the final pages that Jackie Onassis Kennedy had been kind enough to review the book and give helpful comments (or words to that effect). Well, unless I am much mistaken she is hardly the most eminent scholar of Irish history and nor is Cahill judging from this book. It is badly written, lacks both profondity and originality, and has a most irritating and condescending tone. I could have written it myself based on what I remember from school history classes a few years ago."
1,Disappointing at least,"I read this book due to the reviews found here at Amazon.com, what a disappointment. This book is not only disappointing but at times downright offensive. Cahill talks about Cicero being boring and Ausonius being pretentious, both these descriptions could and should apply to Cahill. The level of scholarship in this book is dismal at best. His attempts at being clever are no more than weak. His snide comments about Mormons and Jehovahs Witnesses (very out of place in a book proporting to be a history of the fall of Rome to Medieval Europe)are proof of his lack of study. The one thing that this book has to offer is the concise story of Saint Patrick, however there are many other and better sources for this."
2,Quaint but historically uninteresting,"There is lots of good historical evidence, circumstantialand factual that leads one to believe that Ireland playeda crucial role in the development of Western Christian Europe.Unfortunately, none of that can be found in this book. Ithought the book wandered and was filled with too many interestingbut inconclusive stories. The information on St. Patrick wasprobably the most effective part of the book, but the title wasnot ""A Biography of St. Patrick.""I felt that it wouldn't have been too hard for the author todig a bit deeper into historical fact to give us something thatwe could sink our teeth in.Jeb Bolding"
2,Book is merely a good intro to the subject.,"Being half Irish (my grandfather came to the states after WWI) I am always interested in reading current views on Irish history. As far as the book goes, it is excellent. But that distance is a mere chapter. After every section there were many questions that should have been answered. This book is barely the ""Cliff Notes"" version of how the Irish monks saved the Western literary civilization.Submitted by: don (Kavanaugh) shafe"
3,Good book - worth reading,"I found the book to be a bit sparse. This book is a good read, but there are certainly better books available, such as the PBS book ""In Search of Ancient Ireland"" by Carmel McCaffrey & Leo Eaton."
3,What happened between then and now?,"While it's always interesting to get a short refresher course in classicism, ""How the Irish..."" seems hardly a balanced work. He briefly mentions other sources, like the moorish library at Toledo, as possible other contenders for the revivals of the classics, while trumpeting the role of the open-minded, scholarly Irish.If he's right about this, there's another book waiting to be written--about what happened to the Irish Catholic church between the time of the vikings and its current state--one only needs to hear the name Parnell to remember its regressive role in more recent history. What happened to make that worldly, scholarly society decay into the painfully unenlightened and reactionary church that has tormented both old and new worlds in more recent years? Cahill avoids a seeming contradiction between his view of history and our common notion of the present."
2,A rare send-back,"Cahill has exaggerated an historical sidelight (and not a unique one, i.e., a culture with a bibliographic tradition that survived the relative chaos after the fall of Rome) into an overblown rumination on illuminated manuscripts and monks. Plodding and dull, with few surprises for the literate. A disappointment."
2,How the Irish Saved Civilization,"This book came highly recommended by a couple of people. I'm not sure why. It was interesting if you're a history buff, but expect the reading to feel more like you're in school again and have to read something for a paper coming up. It could have been more engaging. I wouldn't recommend it, but I did learn some interesting facts about the Irish."
3,Complex,Still trying to get through the Roman era of understanding - will comment once finished. Truly hinges on the edges of history.
3,how the irish saved civilization,"It's a good read, but some parts the author just goes on and on. I did enjoyed it. I would recommend the book to someone who want to understand Irish people a little more."
2,Short and lacks Focus,"For a product who's title makes a claim for the product, this book did little to back the claim. Mostly I saw it as a biased catholic and Irish catholic survey of a brief period of history. I have not done as much reading in the area as others might have, but from what I do know about the so-called ""Dark ages"" is that it is the east that we should be thanking for the preservation of cultural documents from Roman and Hellenic times. My largest complaint is that the author includes several overly broad generalizations about both the Irish people and the continental peoples they came into contact with and the cultures of both groups of citizens. The author seems not to be a professional historian, and thus perhaps should not be held to such great rigor, but the grand claim really is not backed up in the text. On the plus side, the book is both short and the writer is a good storyteller, so even if you feel that time is wasted reading this book, not much time is wasted."
3,"Interesting, but incomplete and poorly cited survey.","This book has a wonderful premise, and the author an engaging style. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver on its promise. Cahill seemingly wants to keep this book to a size pleasing to popular readers, and to avoid direct citations of facts, theories, and other key historical elements.The book feels like the synopsis of a more carefully researched and cited, but lengthier tome. This could easily have been a 5 star book, if only the author had been willing to take more time with the details and better documented his facts and theories."
4,"Good, but does not have the depth that was needed.","Cahill's book sets out to prove a bold premise (that would hold NO water with anyone born east of Istanbul) but doesn't go into the level of detail that is needed for the task. Although I found the book quite interesting, I found myself hoping for more detail at the end of each chapter and not finding it. In fact, I read this book just after reading Brendan Lehane's ""Early Celtic Christianity,"" which I recommend more highly, and found that had it not been for Lehane's strong foundation (particularly on Columbanus) I most likely would not have been able to see deeply into many of the issues that Cahill just took a glancing look at. I am of the opinion that Mr Cahill would be interesting to sit down to dinner with, but that this book only reveals the surface of his thoughts.A good read for people new to the subject matter. Get Lehane's book next (if you can find it)."
2,Cocktail History,"The role of Irish monks in preserving classical literary and historical texts was something of a historical secret outside of Ireland. No longer thanks to Cahill. Yet, the reader learns precious little about this important history. Instead, the reader must enudre the smarmy, look-how-clever-I-am ramblings of an author who fancies himself as a renaissance scholar--seamlessly melding history, religion, anthropology, sociology and literature. Cahill's book reads more like an alumni weekend lecture--designed to entertain more than inform and better received if the audience has been drinking. The subject deserves much better."
1,History this is not,"Unfortunately for the average reader this book reads like a history book but equally unfortunately it is not. It is everything that people say it is in the way of being an entertaining read, an interesting read etc. etc. but Cahill knows very little about his source material. As someone else pointed out his descriptions of pre-Christian Ireland are not accurate. His opinions are based on pro-Christian texts written in later times to denigrate the pagan Irish. The information he gives on St. Patrick is based on later myth and not historical texts of which there are very little dating from fifth century Ireland. As a history teacher I do not recommend this book to students expect as a form of fiction. It should not be read too closely and serious readers who really want to learn about this time in Ireland should go elsewhere for more accurate knowledge."
1,superficial knowlege of the literature and the time,"Mr. Cahill's book is very superficial. He does not deal with the real questions and complexities concerning Ireland in this time period. Instead he presents us with vague representations of Augustinian thought, or misrepresentations, and baseless conjectures. His reading of early Irish literature is specious, and shows no real acquaintance with the subject. It is typical that a book like this could become such a bestseller. It tells readers what they want, and requires no real intelligenmce or understanding."
1,Bad Bigoted History.,"This is PURE JUNK! Here is why? The author fails to touch the topic untill over 200 dull pages. Second he contradicts dozens of scholarly sources that disagree with him,{Richard Fletcher and Norman Davies} yet he does not prove them wrong! Third, the other orders of monks all over southern Europe, the Arab middle east, and the Byzantine Empire were all increasing learning before Patrick ever was born. Read the top most ""helpful reviews of this shockingly offensive pamphlet."" I am sure you will find the one star reviews far more honest and detailed than the ""Naive positive reviewers."" There are always people who will whitewash bigotry if it supports their own ethnic delusions of grandeur. I am the third Asian person to boycott this author. I have noticed that many others agree with us. ""THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE."""
5,Overdue Book,"The eyebrow-raising title pretty well says it all for this book, which presents, in a popular format, the rich heritage and influence of Irish Christianity upon the whole of Western Europe in the early Middle Ages. (Although the citizens of the Eastern Roman Empire would have laughed at the notion that their civilization was in any sense ""saved"" by the Irish!). The author does a creditable job of casting light on a part of Western history that often gets short shrift in the history books: how the Irish monks of the 6th and 7th centuries ""jump-started"" literacy and learning during the darkest part of the Dark Ages. A very informative and enjoyable read!"
1,How the Irish Saved Civilization,"I am glad to see that there were others who actually found the book entertaining. My father gave me the book for Christmas and, since I am part Scotch-Irish and visited Ireland with my father, the title looked inviting. However, Thomas Cahill wandered all over the place with this book. Another review that said 40 pages crammed in to 240 pages (or something like that) is probably the best description. If I wasn't so determined, I would have quit reading this book after 48 pages (which I almost did). I don't think I will be picking anything up by Thomas Cahill in the near future."
1,sloppily done in every way,"This is one of the worst books I ever read. It is inaccurate, poorly documented, racist, and calculated to appeal to ethnic pride alone. He even compares ""hordes of unwashed barbarians"" to Mexican immigrants! He denies to give many sources, saying they are all in his head ""like radiation from the big bang."" He compares Confucius' lack of personalization to ""a Chinese fortune cookie."" He says without the Irish we would have ""a world without books""! This book does a disservice to the Irish, whose contribution to Western culture is considerable, by its exaggerations, sloppy documentation, condescension and outrageous statements. This is not a history. He mixes legend and fact and opinion, without making clear which is which. One star is too high a rating."
1,NO FRANK McCOURT HERE.,"The only way this book would have had a drop of truth is if Italy, Greece, Persia, and the entire Middle East had sank into the sea! As others have painfully mentioned this non-scholarly book is filled with bigotry, lies, distortions, and selective amnesia! I saw the author on C-SPAN years ago, and like a politician he was evasive whenever his nutty claims were questioned. His book proved only that he can pad a demented thesis. He will never be as honest or as talented as Frank McCourt who wrote ""Angela's Ashes."" But, I doubt even he could make the title convincing? I will never waste my time on anything TC writes again."
1,truth?,"Several of my peers repeatedly told me that I should read this book. I've already done some considerable study in Irish literature in my graduate work, so I thought it was about time that I got around to reading this best-seller. Cayhill is a clever word-smith. However, I was sorely disappointed in the book. As a scholar, Cayhill is irresponsible and sloppy. He includes many details -- such as his description of a river running through Jerusalem in Jesus' time (Jerusalem doesn't have a river, only a spring) and his account of the Morrigan -- which are either inaccurate or misleading. His condescending tone and attitudes toward other ethnic groups, namely the Chinese and Mexicans, are also troubling. All of these problems lead me to distrust all his scholarship and writing."
1,Total Rubbish.,"The last reviwer is a bit daft. In some 70 years of reading History I have never read such lies, distortions, and incoherent gibberish. The author is CLEARLY appealing to ethnic sentiment over ""EVIDENCE AND FACTS."" I suggest readers read the dozen or so ""Most Helpful Reviews."" Those reviewers were very in depth and know their SUBJECT."
1,WORST METHODS AND FALSE.,"I have been reading the history of this period for over forty years. This is the worst bunk I have ever read. Here are my reasons. 1, He fails to cite his sources. 2,He fails to prove his thesis. 3,He contradicts the very title by stating that books never vanished from Italy, Greece, and the most Romanized parts of the western Roman world. 4,He pads the book with a ton of extraneous info that has nothing to do with the topics. 5,He inexplicably bashes other groups for no reason. Lastly, the so-called style is a disorganized, and incoherent rambling. I suggest that before anyone wastes their money. They read all of the reviews of this book wih a fine tooth comb and an open mind."
1,How Cahill rewrites history,"Cahill is rewriting history to appeal to the Irish American public. His thesis has no supporting facts and he ignores hard evidence of civilization in Europe. For example, Cahill says that theIrish saved civilization through the monastic work of copping books. However, there were monasteries in Gaul and scattered throughout the Germanic Tribal wilderness who were also copying books at the same time as the Irish. Cahill also states that with the fall of Rome, civilization lost the ability to ""think, read and build."" He again ignores buildings like the Haga Sophia, and men like Charlemagne who built his palace in Aachen and brought back classically humanism. In short, Cahill is rewriting history to sell books to people of Irish descent who want to hear good things about their ancestors. His thesis holds no water and is laughable to anyone who knows the actual history of that era."
5,how the irish saved civilization,This book gives a unique perspective of the Irish involvement in learning in the middle ages. Memorizing dates and names and famous battles is shown as at best secondary.
3,"entertaining, but...","This book was an enjoyable book and entertaining, but it didn't really discuss too much of how the Irish saved civilization. Sure we learn about the saints and other influences in Irish history, but it didn't live up to my expectations (of the title). I do recommend this book, but you need to pick up something else as well."
5,Another great book by Thomas Cahill,"Cahill's done a great job of illustrating how seemingly distant and apparently unrelated events combine and flow over the ages. He's done a fine job of showing the interplay of the waning Roman Empire, early Christianity, and the particulars of Irish culture which were instrumental in preserving Europes's wisdom through the Middle Ages. His book is enlightening from an academic, as well as a religious standpoint. And I must admit, my own Celtic pride was stirred as I read of how my ancestors contributed to the preservation of knowledge; a benefit we continue to reap today."
5,"Ireland, with her love of language, saves the classics.","the score of ""9"" was because this would not greatly entertain a young, modern audience -- but it's a great read! With their love of language and thought the monks of Ireland copy from many of the great libraries of Europe's ""Holy Roman Empire"", soon after discovering literacy. When the Germanic, pagan Goths and Visigoths destroy the Empire and all its libraries all that's left of classical civilization is in the monasteries of Ireland. In their missionary work to return Christianity to Europe these Irish monks also brought civilization back.This wonderful book describes how Ireland has influenced all of modern European civilization and Christianity.We are fortunate those Celts, on their isolated island, loved language and thought so very much."
3,a fun dose of propaganda,"Cahill makes an interesting thesis, though he strays far from the complexities of medieval Europe. In his simplified and glorified view of the era, some of his history is indeed relevant and a good starting place for someone interested in the era, but a serious or even totally accurate history, this is not. Pity we Irish didn't really have that large a part to play in world history, though we like to think we did!"
4,Go Irish!!!,"If ""funnest"" were a real word, I most assuredly would chose to use it now, in description of this exceptional book.Author/historian Cahill does a fantastic job of touching upon several hundred years of history, in just over 200 pages. A tight fit, yes, but that's ok, he isn't trying to illuminate every nook and cranny of the past, but give us a clear and reasonable look at certain pieces, snapshots if you will, of his subject:the slow fall of the jaded Roman Empire (which opened the floodgates to an intellectual hell which very nearly consumed the West), all the way forward to the actions of one of history's most unlikely group of heroes; lusty Irish warriors turned holy men and women, giving us back the gift of knowledge.Heartily recommended!"
4,How the Irish Saved Civilization,The book showed how Irish monks preserved much of western culture during the dark ages. The monks recorded and preserved lititure and other cultural items including Jewish writings.
4,Mixed review,"Extremely well written and accurate, for the most part. HOWEVER: cites Gerardus Cambrensis regarding the alleged mating of the O Donnell with a white mare - apparently not aware that G. C. is not credible, his history having been written as an apologetic for his uncle, the first Norman Fitzgerald who needed proof of the ""subhuman"" status of the Irish to help justify his atrocities. ALSO pushes the Henry VIII compromise: Catholicism with fornication. There is almost no evidence to back up his allegations of sexual looseness during the Golden Age. That came later, after the Vikings destroyed much of the cultural infrastructure, but that is another story and perhaps a different agenda."
4,"Hmmm, interesting theories!",How the Irish Saved Civilization postulates an interesting and charming theory that wouldn't be around today for us to ponder were it not for the Irish monks of the middle ages. Cahill has all of the facts that back up his rather interesting theories. His opinions about how the Irish had it together during the oppressive times are quite convincing. I would have believed his theories had I not already been educated on said subject. It is an entertaining read conveyed by an Irishman with the true gift of babble.
3,"Jewish girl from PA, a lover of history","I read this book upon hearing it was on the bestseller's list, and now two years later my school had a copy so I decided to pick it up. I picked the book for a project and decided to give it a try. Dispite the fact of not having any Irish heritage or knowledge of Western Civilization (unfortuantly I was going to learn that during the other half of the year) I decided to go through the pages of the unknown wasteland a get a small understanding. I found the book intriguing but it didn't agree with me as much. He did give me a better understanding though the title pushes the book for not much more than getting it off the shelves. Good read! A way to learn something!"
