4,Shadow's Word - 3 Doors Down - Away From the Sun,"3 Doors Down's Away From the Sun is quite a moving album. Every track of this CD seems to fill the need of the listener. It rocks and it moves. When you listen to it you feel as if you are truly part of the music.This album is a piece of art. True, it could have been made a little better. Just a touch. But nonetheless, it proves to be quite amazing. I would recommend this CD to music lovers without hesitation."
3,pretty darn good cd,"I got this cd when it came out and thought that if i liked it as much as ""The better life"" then i would love it. but, for me, i thought that it was a little bit of a let down. This is their worst cd(and even then its still not that bad). With the exception of a couple of some songs(ticket to heaven, changes, the last song, and going down in flames is the best song on the album)their a little boring. I would still recommend this cd for any 3dd fans. Overall, its a pretty darn good cd."
4,No filler here,"I have liked every 3 Doors Down single I have heard on the radio, so I thought I just might like the rest of their stuff. Well, I was right there. This is a good, solid, southern rock album with sold, relatable lyrics.Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and Away From The Sun are the three excellent singles that most of us are very familiar with. None of the rest of the songs disappoint in the least. This holds together as being an all around good effort. There are certainly no filler songs, which in itself is a strong testament to the quality of this band and their work.3 Doors Down have their own recognizable style, but at the same time, they are not afraid of experimenting a bit. If you like their singles, I would recommend giving this a listen. There are no disappointing surprises here, but there isn't any boring monotony either. They have struck the perfect balance if you ask me."
2,Away From my Playlist...,"Kryptonite seems to be the only song from this band that I like. The rest is very boring. And that song isn't even on this album. So I don't think I could in my right mind recommend this to anyone. I guess that this band just had a one-hit-wonder and turned some heads for a few seconds, then everyone got bored with the rest. Not recommended."
1,Makes me Sick,"You people make me sick sometimes, 3 doors down putting out the best album ever??? Thats the dumbest thing Ive ever heard. These guys have no talent what so ever, every song is the same repetative thing over and over again. There is no uniqueness in the group. I mean come on my 10 year old sister listens to these guys. I mean I respect your guys opinions of music, but doesnt this group seem a little bit boring?"
1,More pathetic mainstream crap,"I hate this band. Three Dumbasses Down is basicly another made-for-radio band without ANY orginality. The lyrics, guitars, bass, drums, and vocals all suck. For good mainstream music listen to Audioslave, Soundgarden, Korn, Godsmack, System Of A Down, etc., etc. And for good msic in general, listen to Manowar, Kreator, Lacuna Coil, The Haunted, Meshuggah, etc."
2,Somewhat boring....,"Straight up American rock music is what you can classify this disc. Throughout the entire LP you will find heavy guitar-filled choruses, melodic verses for the most part and fairly good production. The album is listenable although there is definitely a pattern here to be heard, which sometimes bored me as the listener. It seems as most of the tracks have a slow to mid-tempo airy verse with some guitar strumming, then the choruses explode with heavy guitar and aggressive vocals. This does work on a song by song basis, but as an album - it seems a bit repetitive. The song writing itself is just average, some songs are pretty boring actually but remain listenable just for the loud guitar and drums and good production quality. One thing I do like is singer, Brad Arnold pretty well without screaming like some rockers have to do."
3,Not the better one...,"Ok, Away from the Sun is not a bad CD, far from it actually. However, it does not have the same hit-potential songs as did The Better Life. There is no Loser or Be Like That here, and of course no new Kryptonite. When I'm Gone and Away From the Sun might get played a lot on radio, but who will remeber them in 9 months?The band has also changed their sound on this album. Some will say their musical abilities have grown, which may be true. But it is that dark, unclear sound I love about 3 Doors. Hopefully they will find back to that on their third release.So if you already are a fan you'll probably enjoy this CD. If you're not, start with The Better Life instead."
3,"Not the definitive work on strategic planning, but helpful.","This book provides a useful methodology to help translate vision into action. While I can't call this book the definitive guide to strategic planning, it is one of the sources I refer to when conducting strategic planning sessions with my clients. - Adam Lefton (adamleft@webspan.net)"
3,This book was OK,"I bought this for its 'classroom' style, but unfortunately, I haven't gotten much out of it. The pictures weren't even good examples for me to mimic. I guess I'm glad to have it for future reference, but I did cancel ""Studio Photography"" off of my order once I read through ""Location Photography""."
3,Not bad; not amazing,"When reading the back of the board, I thought this was going to be so much fun. I mean the game and the essence of it is fun, but it gets really boring after a while. The questions are sometimes funny (would you rather have huge ears or a nose), but overall it really wasn't my kind of game. Also, I recommend to play this game with A LOT of people, because less people is just asking for boredom!"
3,Boring!,"My whole family found this game to be rather boring. We played it once, with the board, it seemed like it would never end. No one liked it. Even reading the cards isn't fun, they are almost the same. Here is what two cards that I just saw said, 'Would you rather be thirteen years old forever OR sixty-three years old forever' here is the other card 'Would you rather be thirteen years old forever OR sixty-five years old forever'. There are other ones similar to eachother like that, too. I wouldn't get this if I were you. Probably worth $8.00 maybe even $6.00, not worth the $30.00 that was paid."
2,Not so good,Game became boring after only five min. The price was high and value low so I cannot recommend it!
2,"Fun for family, but for just adults","I remember playing the original version and that was fun. This version still has some pretty good questions, but they are more for a broader audience. I played with just adults and we got bored. The directions are not very clear. I'm going to either give it to my sister or just hold onto it for the family get togethers."
4,It was okay,I played this game with my family & had an okay time. I think it's a pretty good/interesting game that I would have a much better time playing with my friends.
2,Not For My Family,"I don't know if my family is just weird or what, but we didn't even finish playing the first (and only) game. They took it to be a strategy game, so they were guessing what the other person would say to fake them out rather than guess what the other person would feel in his heart. But the scenarios were weird and contrived so it wasn't like learning something new about each other. Those types of scenarios would never come up. I really wanted to love it. I hyped it up before we started, but ended up with a big let down."
3,Game not what I expected,"I bought ""Would You Rather...?"" boardgame after hearing a radio ad about how fun - and funny - it was to play. It wasn't fun or funny. The directions were tedious to follow, and nobody had any fun answering the questions on the cards. I thought it would be like the humorous ""Ungame"" (a similar card game in the 1970s), during which I laughed the whole time. This game offered hardly any humor. The advertising really was misleading. Since some cards had thought-provoking questions, my adult daughter took it home to use as an ice breaker for serious group discussions."
1,you stole my idea,"These questions are lame. How about some edgier questions:1. ""Would you rather be a hurricane or a tornado?""2. ""Would you rather be head butted or slapped?""3. ""Would you rather be mildly electrocuted or attend an Uncle Kracker concert?"""
2,I would rather not play this game...,"This game was very boring. I tried playing it with my family and with some friends, all adults over 25, and nobody found it intriguing. I don't understand what is so great about deciding if you would rather stand in an elevator filled with fat men with bad breath or an elevator filled with wet dogs. The questions were neither interesting nor funny. Everyone agreed it they would rather play a different game."
3,It was alright,"I was super excited to get this game, I had heard so many good things about it. I guess it would be fun, if you played with people who actually are into games, which I found out my family is not. Sad day. But the questions were thougt provoking and maybe someday I can pull it out at a party and it will be fun."
5,Great for family bonding!,"I purchased this game for my 19 year old niece as one of several Christmas presents. After we had finished opening gifts, the whole family sat down and played. All 3 generations in the rooom throughly enjoyed this game. It is a perfect blend of stimulating conversation and silly tasks. We were all on the floor laughing as my nephew allowed my niece to write ""Spaz"" on his forehead with lipstick and nearly chocked with laughter as my brother performed a belly dance in my parent's living room. I would strongly recommend this as a game to keep around for game night with family or friends."
2,Would you rather... have your money back?,"My family used to play a variation of this game by making up our own questions, and it was tons of fun. We always thought it could be a great product if only you could figure out a way to put it in a box and sell it. We could never come up with anything compelling enough to turn it into a board game, however, and neither could Zobmondo.The questions are uninspired, far too contrived, and are only an incidental part of the gameplay. To win at Would You Rather, you have to do ""challenges,"" most of which involve letting other players draw on your face with makeup. Seriously.Would you rather spend your money on a parlor game you can come up with on your own, or use it to buy something else? No brainer."
3,Would you rather play something else?,I bought this game to play with family/friends and though we had a good chuckle over some of the questions the board game itself was kind of a drag. After playing the board game just once we packed the board away and kept the pack of question cards out and just asked those questions to everybody to get some fun and interesting answers.
3,Would You Rather? Not really.,"Would You Rather is too complicated to be fun, at least for our middle class, blue collar, beer drinking, crazy but happy family. Just too convoluted and silly, actually. The questions are inane and irrelevant and not funny. Other than that........"
5,Just got it today - very high quality,"Just opened the box today and was impressed with the quality of the contents. Tiles are easy to read for old eyes - not only large numbers, but also colors are good contrast, tiles are thick and substantial. Haven't played yet but I read quite a few of the questions and found myself laughing at a lot of them. Am looking forward to a great discussion with the question cards on an upcoming road trip."
2,Would you Rather be Pickled in Alum or Play this Game?,"Personally, I'd rather be pickled in alum! The ""would you rather"" questions are OK, but the rules to the challenge questions change each time, take a ridiculous time to understand, and many are just plain not fun. With a world of games out there, pick another one. Though my 11-year old son loves it, so go figure!"
4,Review of Maran Illustrated 2003,"Although I have not completed the full book, I found it very good especially for beginners. I was not conversant at all with Excel and found that I needed it for my employment as my employer had changed my job and I needed the basics.I found the illustrations very good and easy to follow, and anything I needed to know found easy to find in the book.I would recommend this book, especially to anyone with little or no knowledge of Excel."
4,Indispensable info for fashion retailers,"If you deal in women's fashion, this is a necessary reference book. (Hint: It's so important, when I lost mine, I came right here to buy another!) The information on 20th century fashion leaders is especially necessary for antique dealers, vintage clothing shops, and of course womenswear consignment shops. I recommend this book to my readers in the resale industry on my web site, www.tgtbt.com ."
1,I hate these books.,"The ""dummies"" series of books is really for dummies. They talk to you like a child. I get frustrated with how stupid they assume the reader is. I've never bought another one since. And I never completed reading this one."
4,A great place to start if you want to build a web site.,"If you want to build your first web site and you don't know where to begin, read this book. The authors address all the key issues and tools that you will need to understand to get started. Smith and Bebak help you to plan your site design. They then explain ISP's and the major content sites, and they show you how to get started without spending a lot of money - or none at all. A basic introduction is given to HTML tags. They teach you about broswers and all their versions and how this affects your web pages. Even Web TV is addressed. Both PC and Mac spoken here. Elementary web page creation tools are discussed along with web page design techniques and strategies. This book covers all the issues that the web beginner will encounter."
1,Not for Dummies at all,"People buy this book to learn how to create webpages from the beginning, and I am one of them. But after studying whole book, I still have no idea how to start my webpages. The author write a lot to let readers know computing techniques, but he doesn't write in detail how to do step by step; therefore, I have to check google and some html or css tutorial website to see how to work from my own laptop.The book even doesn't say that people have to open wordpad to start html language before launching webpages in internet. Not recommend any beginner to buy this useless book."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"Do not buy this book. The author, Bud Smith, counts on the GeoCities Web site as a teacher for 90% of this book. The only trouble is GeoCities has changed their web site and the examples listed in the book are no longer on the web site and you will be totally lost when the author tells you to go somewhere and when you do what you expect is not there.I felt really let down. I expected the book to teach me how to write web pages. You don't need this book at all if you follow GeoCities instructions on their web site. But you will not learn how to write your web page.If you want to throw away money, then purchase this book, but it won't work on the GeoCities Web site."
3,have not fully use this product yet,"I recently order this product because i intend to build a website. Hoever, i do not have enough usage to give an informed review. I did recieve shipment on time, and the order process was painless."
5,An Excellent Book For a Beginner Web Publisher,"Since I'm new to the web publishing world, I found ""Creating Web Pages for Dummies"" to be very useful and informative. Because of this book, I actually published three home pages and an entire web site! In my opinion, the authors provide detailed and easy to follow instructions. The book was also humorous and an easy read. I was never bored and I actually read a few chapter over again. I really enjoy this book because it taught me something I never thought I would be able to do. This book is a must for the beginner web publisher."
3,A Good Starting Point For Beginners,"If you're already familiar with HTML this is the wrong book. However, if you're just starting & want to move from a program like Page Mill to creating HTML directly this book will help you with the basics: links, images and text formatting. It also covers web development tools and the elements that make web pages good & bad. The book would be better if the subject matter didn't jump around so much and the author covered more complicated HTML (like tables & frames) a little better."
2,Dissapointed,"If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book."
4,Good Book,"This book is ideal for someone who wants to make a simple web site and not have to get into the gory details of HTML. It tells you some good places to find site builders, but it teaches you the basics of HTML for customization. If you are looking to build professional sites, I would get HTML 4 For Dummies, also by IDG Books, which goes into the more advanced HTML."
2,A programer from NJ,"I found this book leaving you in the dark about various tags and syntax. This book doesn't give you true meaning of each tag and its placemant in the HTML document.I had trouble following this book and I've been programming for years. Don't buy this book if you want to really learn HTML. Unless you want to be clear on the <html>, <img>,<body>,<Head> tags there is more then that to HTML."
4,"If you are starting from square one, this is the book!","Apart from the excruciating jokes on every other page, this is an excellent book for getting rapidly into the business of learning how to design web pages. It also brings home to you the miracle of the Internet and gives you an appetite to get right into it straight away. I comment it to anybody who knows very little and wants to get started on publishing a web page.And perhaps even some of the jokes will make you smile - well maybe."
3,"Has great information, but too program-specific.","This is a good introduction to building a web page. There are simple, step by step directions, and the hints and recommendations are very useful. The HTML section is very clear. However, there is too much space devoted to specialized programs - tips for using Composer, Page Mill, AOL. The reader will only be using, at most, one of these programs, and will end up skipping chapters that don't apply. Someone using Page Mill won't need to know how to install Netscape composer, and vice versa. Many programs aren't included at all. I would rather have seen more information that applies to everyone, and saved the specialized tips for a few pages in an appendix."
5,"Thanks to this book, I published my web site in a weekend!","This is the perfect book for a beginner. Although I had previous publishing experience, I was new to web publishing. This book gave me the knowledge I needed to get our companies web site up and running in one weekend. Very easy to read and understand! My only suggestion: more tips on getting hits on your site. END"
1,An engineer at last,"America's engineers are always bemoaning their lack of public appreciation and knowledge. Finally we are beginning to see some mysteries with engineers as detective. Here we have an electrical engineer, and the author actually talks about engineering and Oklahoma's engineering department. One has the sense that this detective actually has a life other than just detecting. Engineers always say they ""solve problems."" Who would make a better detective than someone who solves problems. Hurray for a new engineer-detective."
4,Cute,"Cute mobile, not too difficult to put together. Looks great with the rest of the Hello Kitty crib collection."
3,music lover,"I was not impressed. The music was nice, but a bit slow and repetitive. It is not a favorite of mine."
4,Generally Fine,"This book is good. The intorduction written by OSC itself is wonderful enough. His comments for each stories are also good and helpful. Stories are well-chosen, and altogether they indicate something OSC wanted to show. I rated it with 4 stars not because it's bad or not enough, but because it was not my taste. And it can be to many other people, I'm rather sure. Before ordering this book please read the introdcution pages in the bookstores or somewhere you can. If you like what OSC says and want to see stories of that, buy it then. Otherwise you won't feel 'happy'."
3,It's overall good,I was expecting a little more pictures and more quality. This is all in black in white. It does the job of showing you a sexy yoga workout though.
2,gneah,For a book that offers intimacy...why the clothes? Seems like the authors or editors have shame around intimacy.
2,future guide dogs,"i was hoping it would have been more entertaining for grades 1-4. was really looking for the dvd for the movie ""Love Leads the Way""...about the first seeing eye dog on DVD!!"
5,Highway Heartbreaker.,"As with all true life stories,i enjoyed this story very much.It just goes to show you what can happen in ever day life."
3,Does not hold up.,This is the second folding wheelbarrow that I have purchased. Neither lasted more than a few months. It is a fabulous idea and a great thing to have and use when it is not falling apart. After two months the fabric rips at the seams. This is not from carrying too heavy of loads. Both wheelbarrows ripped at the seams in several places. Both were stored in the garage and were taken care of very well. Good idea but needs work in the quality of workmanship.
3,rushen,"I like Patrice, but why the same songs for what seems like 20 times each... more like an EP single then a full album...."
3,"It's really a dark navy, not black.","The animals are really cute and funky. But the background dye is off. It's definitely navy, not black, and it's blotchy. Yes, it's a batik pattern so some of that is expected. But the blotchiness is a muddy brown color, so it actually looks dirty."
3,Meh.,"Ordered these for Halloween last year, but I waited too long and they didn't arrive until November 1. Oh well, my fault. They'd be fine for that purpose, but most of them aren't all that great tasting. The sour stuff and the coke bottles are good. The rest is pretty uninspired."
1,mystery of death,"Very catchy title; does not deliver what the title suggests; only mystery is sanskrit quotes from the Vedas;saving grace is the history of the piece;i.e. early nineteenth, late eighteenth century, and author's relation to Swami Ramakrishna Paramhansa."
1,Disappointed,Did not come with drivers. None available online. Did not work with XP. Was not optical -- my mistake for not reading more closely--and not USB.
5,A wise investment,"You know how sometimes you put $15 on the counter to buy a CD and it turns out to be a disappointment? That was money spent (perhaps even wasted). I could have asked you the same question about a movie or a book that you pay for and it turns into an expense, not an investment. Well, this book is NOT like that at all. If you buy it (DO), and if you read it (I was going to say savor it...) and if you and your significant other put most (why not all?) of the suggestions in there into practice, I guarantee this will be money well invested. How else would you describe it when you get hours and hours...and hours of fun for $10.95?"
2,Built cheap...,The power cord was built so cheap that after only 1 year of use the darn thing snapped like a twig. IDK what the deal was built poor quality on external components. Otherwise software and range was pretty good.
3,"Sometimes it works, some times it doesn't.","When the router is working, it works beautifully. It seems that the router will eventually just stop allowing connections (possibly due to overheating). The fix is to just turn it off and back on. The wireless card bundled with the router also seems to be a little finicky. You would think that the card would work perfectly with the router, but it does not. The software that comes with the wireless card isn't great, but it can do the job. All in all, you get what you pay for."
1,Do not buy this product,wireless connection is disconnected frequently. you can not play starcraft with other people. sucks.
1,"Lousy card, lousy router, loust deal","Read the reviews, ordered the deal, got burned. The card is garbage, drops in and out, the router drops in and out, then fried a fews days later. Back to Linkysys for now."
2,Product good - service and support is a different issue,"After purchasing this kid I had read previous reviews and I also needed to download the latest drivers and firmware, before the suplied manuals showed the screens and config steps to get the router, cable modem connection and wireless card working. After that I discovered that there was a cover missing on the wireless network card and I could see inside the resistors and other details of the wireless card. I tried twice to report the problem but the outsourced service support was not interested in the missing cover and wanted to troubleshoot the device - no exchange so I consider returning the product to Amazon even though I like it but without cover sooner or later dirt and humidity will reduce the lifetime of the wirless card."
3,"I""m alway resetting!","I've had my wireless router for a year. I bought this because my college-age kids had wireless connections in the dorm and I thought they might want to use there laptops anywhere in the house when they come home on vaction. That was a good plan and they are able to use it in any room. My problem is that every time the electricity and the cable internet go out, my router has to be reset. You have to do it in exactly the right order or you have to start the process all over again. I finally wrote the order down on an index card so that I wouldn't keep having to get the orginal box up from the basement. I have honed my techique and can reset the router in less then 10 minutes. It is still annoying and I'm dreading the summer thunderstorm season."
5,Excellent product. Easy setup,"The wireless kit works perfectly. Setup was as easy as ABC. The router also comes with some security features which should be sufficient for most peoples. The coverage is good too, I can receive near to 100% signal at second floor (router at first floor)."
2,Easy Setup But Limited Reliability,"I received the Netgear router last month and configured it quickly with WEP and locked down by MAC address (its best secure mode). When I was simply browsing the Internet it worked fine, but when I VPN'd to my office to synchronize mail it was unworkable.Theoretically this unit should just pass packets from PC card to router and make no difference where they are going, but since I know the Linksys has no issues I am returing it for that one."
5,FLAWLESS,Router setup easily (I know something about computers but not networks.) I've had it for a while and it has performed extremely well. My laptop has a great signal anywhere in the house.
1,"Poor quality, dead after 4 months","From the time I plugged it into my cable modem, the router would crash hourly until I was able to upgrade the firmware. After that, the router would crash and lockup my modem once a day. This is the worst quality piece of networking gear I have ever purchased. Netgear offers a short 90 day warranty because they know their product won't last longer than that. My router died after 4 months of use. (...) it is not worth wasting your time or money on. I should have paid attention to the other reviewers. I am so disappointed and frustrated with Netgear. It's probably only a matter of time before those with positive reviews have to revise it to zero stars when their router prematurely dies."
2,I've had a lot of trouble with this,"I've had a lot of trouble with this, and even after walking around the house with my laptop and placing the unit every possible location, I have lots of dead spots, and frequently when I'm using it it drops off.I know it is the netgear broadcast base and not the laptop, because the laptop interface works fine everywhere else I use it.I tested the stability of the wireline signal to my house (my brother-in-law is a telephony engineering geek), and it was fine. Again, Netgear is clearly the culprit.It works great if you are in the same room, or in the next room in a thin-walled apartment, but otherwise, not very robust, and certainly does not live up to the specifications."
2,WPA does not work for a lot of people,"I bought this combo because I wanted to upgrade my wireless network with faster speed and higher security. The speed is no problem, but the security is. After upgrading firmware on the router, I was able to configure WPA security (the best wireless security) with no trouble. The same did not hold true for the PC card...I got installation errors on the software upgrade for the card (you can't use WPA without the upgrade), and apparently for certain computers, especially those with AMD processors, the upgrade software simply doesn't work. Tech support was a big waste of time so far.If you want WPA security and you have an AMD-based laptop, you might want to think twice."
3,Don't Answer That Call!,Ok router but we lose our connection when we answer the 900mhz cordless phone. Works fine at 40 feet from router. Haven't tried it further out. Good deal for $35 after rebate.
1,"Does not work on all computers, poor tech support","I bought this product a year ago. Initially I used it for about a month on my office laptop and it functioned ok. I did not use it for few months and then tried to use on my home computer. I could not load it's software and it had some problems with Windows XP. I called the tech support, they asked if I have registered the product. I replied in negative and they suggested to register first which I did and called them back. Then they said that they will only provide tech support for 6 months from the date of purchase and that I have to pay $40 again for tech support. I said I will purchase new one from another company rather then paying again."
2,Very bad customer service,"If you are not a computer whiz, think twice before buying from Netgear. Customer Service in my experience is very bad -- both the system and the people at the end of the phone."
2,dynajim,"I Too Bought Netgear Wireless Products. There's a Conflict Between the XP Software & the Included CD. But You'll Be Lucky to Hear That from Netgear!! When You Encounter the Problem of Connecting(You'll See That You Have a Strong Signal) and Call Tech Support, 1st You'll Be Routed to INDIA (of Course!)! Then , If You Can Understand Them, They Ask if You've Registered Your Product? HELLO!! If I Could Get on Line With it I'd Gladly Register! When You Tell , Try to Tell Them That You Can't Get on, They Tell You to Call Back When You Do!! DON'T BUY THERE PRODUCTS!! I Ended Up Buying a Linsys Card & Router."
1,crap,"worked fine for like a week, then breaks down everyday. need to turn the router off and restart it DAILY. takes at least 10 minutes to get connected EVERY TIME! and then breaks down as often as it pleases! stay away from netgear!!!"
1,"Product is Fine, Support is crap","Were it not for the horrible support Netgear provided, I would have given this product 4 maybe 5 stars. It works just fine, speed and connections are good, setup was easy enough. Just try to have 1 simple question answered by tech support and you will see why I will never purchase another Netgear product. You have to jump through some very annoying hoops just for the opportunity to struggle to be understood and understand what the person is trying to tell you(and I spoke to 3 of them, all pretty much incomprehensible,... and all of them located in India). Maybe the other brands suffer from the same outsourcing problems, but Ill just keep buying from different manufacturers till I find 1 who speaks english."
4,Funny and down to earth,"I rread this book several decades ago as a child and remember it as a very matter-of-fact book with a good sense of humor. The author had lost her leg in a childhood accident and soon adapted so well to her one-legged that she refused her prosthesis as too cumbersome and, since she was an above the knee amputee, too limiting -- she danced much better without it. She mentioned the shoe-trading clubs popular during WWII where a right footed woman wearing size 8 would trade shoes with a left-footed woman and double her wardrobe. Sorry for the brevity, but those are what stick out, thatand the fact that she did find someone to love her, despite her fears to the contrary."
5,spiritual encyclopedia,"Review of many 3D subjects from 4D perspectives.Subjects most fascinating to me were human cloning, mind control, Armageddon, vaccines, abortion, and reptilian influence.These 4D perspectives resonated with me, perhaps because of my experiences with published material from other disincarnate entities.One new insight for me was on the subject of fear.Who was it who said, ""We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.""?Fascinating discussion of the fear controllers and the many ways they get us to be fearful, which blocks our divine inspirations.The Matthew books pass my ""credibility test"" - they focus on the most-important subject: our Godself.Christians might see this as ""made in the image of God""."
2,Lousy shipping service,"The item is satisfactory but late arriving. I ordered it July 20th, the email saying it was shipped and arrival date between July 26th and 29th, party was the 30th. It arrived August 11th, way to late for the party. They had some flimsy excuse as to why it took longer and would not refund shipping and wouldnt pay for shipping to send it back for a refund. Not going to pay postage two ways just to get a refund on an item that cost what the postage was. First bad experience with a Marketplace seller, will never buy from Hope Rebirth again !!!!!!!!!"
3,Tour the Bay area in 36 minutes,"I have had this since about 1990, and it is strange. I have not listened to it more than 10 times. I can only describe it as Camper Van Beethoven meets The Residents, Frank Zappa, Henry Kaiser, Todd Rundgren, Nick Cave, Fred Frith, and Eugene Chadbourne, with a guest appearance from the backup vocalists from Eskimo. With the exception of CVB, I am actually not convinced all these people are not the same person anyway.The artwork is really odd too. An old photo of Native Americans, vultures on a Muslim tomb, and wallpaper from your grandmother's house."
2,Poor quality transfer,"While I love the movie, the quality of the transfer to DVD is very poor. It's not much better than the VHS tape. It definitely is in need of remastering. If they ever do that, I'll buy another copy."
3,Probably one of the most abstract movies I ever saw,"Mahler is the only Ken Russel film I have ever seen, and from what I read from the other reviews, it's a good movie to start with. The movie begins with a dream (which you don't find out until later). If you want my opinion, it's not a very good way to start a movie- for those ""mild stomached"" people it's most likely to provoke them to turn off the TV as soon as the scene comes on. The movie gets a bit milder after that. Gustav Mahler (if you don't know your history) is an Austrian composer, and in the movie it's basically focusing on his life and his bumpy relationship with this wife. The whole movie takes place on a train. Some his flashbacks include his rejection of Judaism for Catholism (he did it for his career), the death of his children, and some conflicts with his wife. I had to watch the film a few times to get the hang of it, but if you like independent films and like to watch movies out of the box, then this is the movie for you."
4,Wonderful music put to the screen,"If you love the music of Mahler, you will love this movie. Although the picture quality is less that perfect, the way the movie is shot and the way his music is put to life is wonderfully entertaining."
2,Attention Mahler fans! This has a soundtrack for you!!,"I confess, art films are, for the most part, lost on me. If you like Ken Russell and the kind of movie he makes, you will like ""Mahler."" A lame remark for a lame movie. As an ardent and devoted fan of Mahler's music I felt compelled to watch this thing, but books are far more revealing about Mahler and his legacy than this pretentious and overwrought wallow in ponderous piffle. The one part that I did like, of course, was the music. Russell puts it to good use - but regrettably we don't see much of Mahler the conductor. In any case, the movie is too bad to be boring, but I look forward to a less arty and more straightforward motion picture interpretation of Mahler's life. Maybe someday."
1,"Mahler, Ken Russell's movie",I think Russell's production is pure trash! What a waste of money! I love Mahler but seeing that movie left a bad taste in my mouth about Mahler. After viewing it I immediately consigned it to the trash can
1,Horrible transfer to DVD,This is among the worst transfers to DVD of any video I have ever seen. Terrible...abominable.Do NOT buy this.The story has some really offensive intellectual avant-garde tripe as well (esp. the opening sequence).AVOID.
1,The worst DVD transfer I ever saw...,"Mahler was a great Ken Russell film. It should have been presented correctly on DVD. Instead what we get is a washed out, blurry, scratched up mess. The sound is bad and the beauty of the cinematography is totally lost. This would be laughable if it weren't a shame. Honestly, the VHS version of this film blows the DVD away (huh?). Mr. Russell was a pioneer in his time and respected by people who enjoyed his mischievous touch. This film needs to be redone by someone who cares!"
1,A TERRIBLE DVD COPY!,"It is amazing how the company putting out this DVD could get away with selling such poor picture quality. There is a noticeable blur that accompanies most tracking shots, the picture is grainy, the colors are rather dull, and seems digitally transferred from an old VHS copy. And do not believe ads calling this a ""widescreen"" edition. It is standard screen size, possibly because it was never filmed in a widescreen format to begin with. The VHS version may be a bit better, but those with the illusion that DVD is always synonymous with superior quality -- BEWARE!"
5,An Expert Highlights the Best Internet Legal Resources,"This is a superior book that will be an asset to any lawyer using the Internet. Ambrogi is a recognized expert, author of a regular column in Law Technology News, and this book benefits from his detailed knowledge of the subject. Well organized and well written, this book shows how good an Internet legal reference can be."
5,Unmasks politically correct and economically destructive myths about urban planning,"Light rail carries a tiny fraction of the people that a highway carries and if you take construction into account it wastes more fuel as well. This is just one of dozens of PC myths that are refuted in this unique, well written book."
1,"o'toole, the shill","This guy is a 'senior fellow' at the Cato institute, the libertarian lobbying group funded by big oil and the notorious Koch Brothers. It would be difficult to find a planner, or anyone who isn't a climate-change denier, that would find anything of value in his writing.Realistic and informed authors to read on the subject of autos and their impact on the urban environment would be Jane Jacobs, or Donald Shoup.The High Cost of Free Parking, Updated EditionThe Death and Life of Great American Cities (50th Anniversary Edition) (Modern Library)Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics"
5,A Citizen's Survival Book,"This book should be in the hands of every citizen who has been upset by development and planning issues in their Cities & Towns. It is an education and an invaluable resource that levels the playing field somewhat when you have to deal with Planning staffs that don't seem to be listening and zoning decisions that aren't making any sense. It's eye-opening and a long overdue revelation for the average citizen.The two negative reviewers of this book sound like they are more than likely city planners themselves and, of course, would not like this book. Interesting that they resort to fear-mongering and conspiracy theories to discredit it.I have read this book and highly recommend it. It was written for all of us who don't have a degree in city planning."
1,Utopian dreams running on empty,"How can anyone write a book on automobiles and not include information on the coming oil crisis?Simply put, the world in running out of fuel for cars. By not including any information on what is to be done - alternative forms of fuel, etc. - the author paints himself as being a utopian dreamer."
4,Great Goggles!,My daughter loves these goggles. The do not have that hard rim around the mask. The entire mask is soft and just suctions to the face for a secure fit. Had to replace them when our dog found them to be a nice chew toy!
5,Finally,"After buying numerous different goggles my 3-1/2 year old granddaughter finally liked these and would keep them on. She now is enjoying going ""under"" the water and having fun. They keep the water out of her nose and have large enough lenses for good vision. They seemed a bit expensive at first but are definitely worth the price."
4,No more plugging noses - hands free to swim,"Our sons, ages 5-8, learned to swim wearing these goggles. We have 2 pairs that are in their second season of wear. The blue strap still looks new. We have one pair with a clear strap that has yellowed from the chlorine. These goggles are easy to adjust and stay in place even when the kids jump into the pool. No need to hold them in place! We had to replace one pair because it disappeared at the pool."
5,Elegant and exotic mood for the holiday season!,"If you want an elegant, low-key recording for the holiday season, this is perfect. It is as light as falling snowflakes in a zen temple garden....so exotic yet calming."
1,Generalized Information,"The author has taken information which is available in your student loan packet and from your lender, complied it with inaccuate state information, compiled it into a book and given it a title. A total waste of money. I returned the book for a refund."
5,Rare Knowledge,"There are very few books detaiting Psionic practices. You are lucky if you have on of these gems. Psionic practiioners are just that, active doers. The fact that this is not written well just shows me the author knows his subject. It is good fools past this by. They should never get this information in general. Funny the reviewer that does not like this book attacks ALL IGAS books. More Trident & Acorn Press people that hate success, because they have none of it. HA! HA!"
3,Good one but not blue!!!,"Nice mouse, very solid and precise. The only problem is the color which is not what they showed up in the picture.....it's a dark gray!!! That was the only disappointing thing."
4,Page-Turner,"I was excited to see this book had large print, so it was much easier to read then the average book. I have already read her book called Black Sheep, so I was very interested to read this book. I thought it was great, the characters were all very animated. Arlene did a fantastic job of helping the reader visualize the people in the book. It was a dark book and it was very suspensful and entertaining. I read the book in no time....mostly because I couldn't put it down. Worth a read....can't wait for her new book to come out."
5,Best Book,Book quality 5*****Price 5*****About the Book:- 5*****This is a gem of a book. I can read this over and over its so good. Rumi is master of peoms and these are some of the best peoms I have ever read. Very easy read. I have started to collect other Rumi books now..
4,Devotion at its finest,"Sufism is a word tossed around by Sunnis claiming to have any hold on the subject, but further inquiry reveals they don't consider it to be orthodox, with the celebration in dancing and singing and so on they don't think are halal practices. For them, it is outside the realm of Islam. In actuality, it pre-dated Islam but later merged with it in its own branch. The result, however, is something quite beautiful, and the poems here show this. I might even say the poetry is very sensual."
2,"I was there, I'll be there again.","Mr. Utts has done an outstanding job of presenting the military history of Clark to everyone who is even remotely interested in what it was like for the average GI. I am fortunate enough to have a history with the base. Although I only spent one year on base, it was a year like no other. I met and married my wife in 1953, and have many fond memories of the base and the people. Fortunately, those memories are of a lush, tropical paradise. I did not experience the eruption of Pinatubo, or the loss of the base back to the PI government. Whether I am able to return or not, Mr. Utts has seen to it that my memories will remain with me for the rest of my life. I only hope that the friends I had there retain the same memories. I am now looking forward to sharing my copy of the book with my sons and my daughter, so that they, too, can envision Clark the way I do. Thank you, Tom Utts."
5,Sorting the Library that is your mind.,I tried this product after my brother recommended it to me. I even think i read somewhere on amazon about the 'sorting function' that this product gives.I take it every morning right when i wake up before i eat anything. On an empty stomach I feel more awake and clear headed relatively quickly. It is subtle. It really seems like it sorts your brain into a system that is more easily accessible by your thoughts.Very happy with product.
4,It works....,pretty good item for the price.... we used these to mark dive sites while out spearfishing. I replaced the line as soon as I got them because it seemed very thin and I also replaced the lead weight with a 2 lb. lead dive weight to be sure the marker didn't drage the weight along the bottom. I did notice the buoy would continue to spool off line in rough seas (2-3' waves) and this caused us to have to circle back and loop the line to prevent additional line from coming off the spool. Worked well for what we needed... hit our dive site every time.
3,Disappointing sound quality,"There's a persistent buzz coming from the line that wasn't there with other phones. That makes this phone annoying to use, which is too bad because it's cool looking."
4,Money door is cheap!,"I love this phone. It's very cute and I especially like the handset. However, I can hear the money rattling around, lost inside the phone. So not all the change is making it down to the bottom. Also, the keyed door to the money is very cheap. it constantly swings open from the slightest tap. I lock it with the key, but every time money is dropped in, it pops back open so I can't let it fill up with coins. It also pops open from simple vibrations such as someone walking past the phone, a door shutting, a breeze. I'm tired of always finding it open."
3,Thought I would like it more,"The glasses are smaller than I thought. The smaller size dishes are the size you put a coffee cup on, which did not make sense because they did not come with coffee cups, and I didn't need any more cups, so I thought they would naturally come with the medium size plates!Once opening this item there is no going back. Very hard to open and would be very hard to return!!"
5,Breathtaking Regency Romance! Great cast & chemistry!,"This is my first by Ms. Suson & I'll definitely be on the lookout for more! Lily takes as much pride in her acting talent as she does in being very capable of supporting herself & her siblings. Her sharp mind, strong character & fiercely independent spirit are a refreshing change to Damon who's bored by clinging, manipulative ninnyhammers. The emotional ups & downs both experience in the course of their relationship was done so beautiful & moving! The groveling scenes were good, too! In short, the whole story just meshed perfectly. I didn't want it to end!"
3,IT'S OKAY,Interesting history ...not something I would recommend but okay if you wanted a little history lesson on the prison and prisoners.
4,Very Interesting and Readable,"This is one comprehensive book. Lots and lots of wonderful pictures and details, Best of all, it is very readable and interesting. Highly recommended if you have any interest in prisons or Alcatraz."
3,"blurry pictures, buy hard copy","A good and entertaining collection of facts about Alcatraz. However, if you're really interested on the subject buy the hard copy. The book contains a lot of pictures (floor plans, reconstructions, aerial photos, letters etc etc), and in Kindle version they are poor/blurry with unreadable text and labels. Of course you can zoom the pictures, but that doesn't help as the pictures are heavily compressed and in low resolution.The book itself is five stars, but the kindle edition with low quality pictures deserves only three."
3,Lots of history !,I could not get into this book. I am 50+ female and after couple chapters put it down and have not picked back up. guys would like better
2,Poor Editing and Mistakes,"The story of Alcatraz was pretty good but the editing of the book was terrible. There were numerous typos and mistakes. Often three words would run together. Even some of the picture captions had editing mistakes. It made reading this book very hard, also, the photos and letters do not translate to the Kindle format. They are too small too read. Maybe on the next edition they can fix all the embarrassing mistakes."
2,I'm skeptical,"I'm a bit skeptical about the accuracy of this book. Certainly the photographs are excellent; however, I find it hard to believe the author's portrayal of conditions at Alcatraz. This book would lead you to believe every warden and guard who served at Alcatraz was a picture of professionalism, fairness, and compassion towards the prisoners. According to the author no prisoner was ever abused or mis-treated and conditions even in the ""dungeon"" were humane. After reading this book I am amazed that anyone ever tried to escape - not because Alcatraz was supposed to be escape proof - but because compared to any prison I've ever heard of, the conditions there were so delightful!"
5,"Great book, one the best of the subject","I just finished reading this on my Kindle, and I have to say, this is a top level work of research on ""The Rock"". The history from the island being a important military location to the infamous prison years are well covered, as are some of the most famous/infamous criminals who were residents. Example-Henri Young, the central character in ""Murder in the First"" has a chapter and it makes you reasses what he was really like. (Hint: he was not the angel/victim he was made out to be)Loads of great pictues are also present, so you get the gritty feel of prison.My only issue is that the author sanitizes/white washes the guards and wardens a bit. He makes it seem that they were all on the up and up and that things like beatings and excessive punishments did not happen. Which, we all know most likely did happen more often than the Staff would have liked to admit.Don't let that little issue stop you..read this book."
5,Alcatraz history,"Having visited ""The Rock"" twice, I wish I had read this book before going. It really seems to cut through the myth and gets to what happened there."
5,Great!,"If you have ever been to Alcatraz or are planning to go, you should consider this book. It will give you a profound insight into the details of the penitentiary, the people around it, its history. Moreover, the pics in the book are fabulous. 5 stars!"
5,An excellent historical reference work,"Fascinating and absorbing reading. I regard this as an exceptional resource, one well worth having even for those who do not have an interest in history. It gives a first hand peek into the inner machinations of one of the best known yet secretive institutions in modern times. An enviable effort on the part of the author."
4,Great book!,Really enjoyed this book - it takes you from the beginning of time (when man learned how to sail the world) up till present. Alot of information that I did not know about the famous Alcatraz. Highly recommend!
1,Horrible!,"I love John Mayer, but this is the most terrible thing I have ever heard in my life! They made the songs totally weird and they have the worst voices EVER!"
1,This really is terrible,"If they were bringing something new to the songs, that would be great...but first of all, this guy is like 27 (and I do really like him, don't get me wrong) but what the hell are they doing a tribute to a guy who has three (actually two and a half) albums out? Who's next? Beyonce? This is just silly...just buy his normal albums and leave this one alone."
4,The Virtuous Therapist by Cohen & Cohen,"Cohen and Cohen provide a refreshing alternative to rule-based approaches to the ethical practice of counseling and psychotherapy. Their backgrounds in philosophy, ethical theory, and mental health practice combine to yield a solid foundation for arriving at ethical decisions in the delivery of mental health services. While the first chapter on ethical theory is quite dense, especially for those not trained in the field, subsequent chapters are reader friendly. The authors clearly outline the basic tenets of virtue ethics and the seven major principles that guide this type of ethical decision making. Each chapter includes case studies that illustrate the authors' analyses of the degree to which therapists acted in accordance with virtue ethics. This book is especially useful for mental health practitioners who need to earn continuing education credits relevant to ethical practice of counseling and psychotherapy."
4,Curmudgeonly and terse,Not your typical autobiography. It's really a memoir because it is less structured than an autobiography. Ogilvy is an asymmetrical thinker who likes being obnoxious. I liked it because he does not disappoint; he does it his way. I was not bored by it.
5,Linda,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for a young boy, who loved it. He placed it on his bedroom wall, and the laminating allowed him to mark on it with a dry erase marker."
4,Where Are the Four Missing Months?,"A lovely Calendar with beautiful Hubble photos. Unfortunately, there are only 12 of them, not 16. While I have found a place for this in my home, I originally purchased it to hang in my classroom. A 16-month calendar meant that I could hang it in September instead of having a blank area on my bulletin board for 4 months. I now have to go shopping again, as this one starts, as most conventional calendars with January. The product numbers all match. It was the calendar pictured. How did Amazon manage to mis-represent the calendar length? The pictures are beautiful, though. A great 12-month calendar."
5,Saved by Soup,I have never felt more of a need to comment on any book. I have over 800 cookbooks and this is a daily user. I have made over half of the soups and the book is simply amazing. ALL of the recipes rate 5 stars. A MUST BOOK in all homes.
5,Excellent so far!,"I bought this book based on the recommendations I read here, and I have not been disappointed. I made the Lemony Chickpea and Escarole soup the other night, and it was very, very good. It was simple, quick, required few ingredients, and tasted great. There are lots of what appear to be the same type of recipes in this book. I look forward to using this book frequently, especially for quick and warming lunches."
3,Okay I Guess,This book is okay if you want to follow recipes. I find just making stuff up is easier. I am also finding that it doesn't pay to buy any recipe books anymore since there are so many great recipes online and you can pick and choose rather then getting stuck with a book where you may only use one or two ideas.
5,great book!,"very good selections of healthy soups! Each has the calorie count on it, so you know ur not over eating.lol. exactly what im looking for. thank you!"
4,Saved by Soup,"this book has a lot of useful information that helps in our fight for good health, fast, easy cooking and time saving. I have used some of the recipes and find them quite satisfactory."
1,Teen Trends,The hair on these dolls is of poor quality. It tangles easily and then most little girls don't like to play with the doll at all.
3,Great but...,"I bought this doll today and she is great, but there are strands of hair that I can easily pull out and one uf her legs keeps going backwards. That's annoying! If you don't want to go through this trouble, don't buy this doll!"
5,The Best I've used (and abused)!,"I have never been happier with a pocket knife. I received this knife as a birthday gift and immediately began carrying it. I am impressed with the versatility of the Knife, the amount I actually utilize the rope/seatbelt cutter, and the durability of this knife. I am not easy on my tools, and this knife has stood up to cutting cardboard, rope, nylon, Para cord, even bailing wire. Light prying has jacked up the finish of the blade, but the blade itself is still straight. It holds an edge like a champ, and a lansky sharpening system keeps it razor-edged. I did have to replace this knife with another one, not because it broke but because someone stole it.....too bad I know it won't break on them lol.Caveat: This knife is moderately thicker than your typical drop-point or tanto pointed pocket knife of comparable size. It's not a problem for uniform pants, dickies, jeans etc but I'd recommend going with something thinner if you typically wear khakis or dress pants."
2,Returning Holster to Amazon/ not safe!,"I am a huge fan of Amazon and this review in no way reflects the level of service I have recieved from them. DO NOT BUY THIS HOLSTER IF YOU HAVE AN AMBEDEXTRIOUS SAFTY 1911!!! I carry ""cocked and locked"" full time as an investigator. This holster is sturdy and typical Bianchi good quality BUT the way the thumb strap wraps around the rear of my Kimber Pro CDP II it causes the SAFETY TO CLICK OFF during normal wear. Enough said! I gave this item a two star because it says its for 1911 style pistols... well its not!"
1,Bored out of my belly,I just bought this cd hoping it will be able take my belly dancing workout to the next level. Boy was I wrong! The cd sounds NOTHING like belly dancing music. I wish I could get my money back!
3,"Good kit, good fit, could be better plastic though..","This would be a great product if the plastic was just slightly less flimsy feeling.Everything fit well, but the plastic just .. feels crappy. I took one of the accessories that wasn't needed for my install and bent it to see how easily it would break, just snapped right away.None of the parts I actually installed broke, so I can't fault the company... I guess I just don't have high confidence for its longevity. But people throw away cars these days anyway so I guess no big deal.Ignoring material quality, everything else about this kit is excellent."
5,mother goose--made from scratch,"like to cook? like to make food from scratch? this, like all the other mother goose cook books is great. you make food from scratch and you can tweek the recipes to your liking. nothing ntastes better than food made from scatch and not from a box or microwaved. like all M.G. cook books it has crafts and helpful hints for the cook in the family"
5,Love Gooseberry Cookbooks,"This Made from Scratch cookbook is excellent and I got it for a great price. If you enjoy homespun recipes, you will enjoy this book."
4,(...),"If you like Newbery award winners, this book is for you. The Door in the Wall, by Marguerite de Angeli, is about a boy with Polio who goes on an exotic journey through a big forest to get help from his good friend, Peter. He needs Peter's help to warn of barbarians attacking his knight home. This book is for second graders and up. Through this book, you can learn that even if you're unable to walk, you can do great things."
3,A YOUNG knight in shining armor!!!!!!!,I give this book 3 stars for it's creative descriptions.This book is for those people who like Knights in shining armor and exciting adventorious fun! A young 10 year old boy is chosen to become a knight - come on this is greatly imaganitive!!! It draws you into the book and it is though your really there.I recomend this book for the young people who like the Middle Ages. I hope ever one ejoys this book like I did!!
4,"Inspirational, but a little confusing","This was a really inspirational book about a young boy in medival England who must deal with being paralysed in the legs. He is cared for by a monk and numerous other people. When Welsh people invade their keep, it is Robin's turn to serve his king and save the day."
3,BBLC,"Enjoy books on tape, however, not exactly what I was looking for as far as the narrator. Wish there had been some way of finding out who the narrator was before ordering."
3,Pretty good!,It was exciting at some points and boring at others. The story line was unusual. It was sort of surprising. If you like the Middle Ages READ THIS BOOK!!!
3,The Door In The Wall,The Door in the wall was about a kid named robin that early in the book he got sick and lost the useage of his legs. So he makes crutces and gets around on those. so he goes with Brother Luke to a castle. The catle got attacked by the welsh and they didi not have enough people to defend the castle. So Robin journeys to another place and gets the army from there to help them fight. so they won the fight and still sot to keep the castle. After that his mother and father came to the castle.The thing i liked most about the book is near the end at the battle. The other thing i liked about the book is that even though Robin could not walk he did every thing that normal people could do. The thing i did not like about is that it was boring in the middle. over all it was a good book.
1,This edition is horrible!,"This is a wonderful book--I highly recommend it, but don't order this newest edition by Laurel-leaf. It is so small and the print is tiny. I am horribly disappointed in it because I purchased multiple copies for a reading discussion. This book is perfect for 4th graders, but this edition and the font size is not!"
4,Recommended,"Robin, the son of a knight, is all set to set off for the home of a noble lord where he is to begin training as a page. Then tragedy strikes. Robin is beset with an illness that leaves him unable to walk. His servants come down with the plague and he is left alone. Just in time he is rescued by a monk who carries him to safety at a monastery, a monk who helps him find the door in the wall Robin needs to leave his castle home and the doors in the wall Robin needs to find in order to make his life a good one.Though this is a happier story than one might anticipate, Robin experiences no miracle cures and has no easy transformations. Time and love and learning help change a moody, spoiled boy of privilege into a boy of courage and compassion."
5,Great Topic Book for home schooling,"This book was loved by the whole family, a great story about the middle ages. Easy to read but full of complexity that can be a jumping off point for a lesson."
4,pleasing Newbery Medal winner,This 1950 Newbery Medal winner is a charming story of a boy who helps save the day despite problems with his legs. A great story that keeps you interested right to the end.
5,Great to have for Medieval Unit study,Keeps you glued to your seat while Mom reads it to you. Really great book.
3,Fairfax Virgnia book review,"Book ReviewHave you ever wanted to live in a church or be a knight? Well a boy named Robin got to experience living in a church with other people with disabilities like him. Robin can't walk and his dad is off at war and his mom is waiting on the queen. The reason he got taken from where he was in his house is because he was very spoiled and rude to the people that lived with him and they left him alone. He got crutches and he experiences a long and hard journey. In this journey he performs a noble act. He goes through thieves and robbers and almost gets killed. I don't like this book because it is very confusing, but if you like those kinds of books and medieval times then this is the book for advanced 3rd graders and up. I didn't even mention that it's called The Door in the Wall, by Marguerite de Angeli and it's a Newbery award winning book."
4,Good book,"I read this book back when I was in 6th grade. its what helped me to be interested in the midevil times. We really got into the time period and had fun with. I think the book shows just how, if you put your mind to it, you can over come the obsicles in your life. Even if that means changing the goals you originally had"
2,Not exactly fun to read,"I read this book as required reading for school, and it's easy to see why I wouldn't read it by my own choice. I won't say this book is trash, because it isn't, but it is in that league. Though the chapter about the robbers was mildly gripping, this book is no thriller. Reading about Robin, the crippled boy, is a slight waste of time and provides little information about life in the Middle Ages. If you are honestly interested in historical fiction, you might like this. But if you're searching for entertainment, look elsewhere."
2,semi-good book,"This book has a very good lesson to be learned, but I found the book very hard to follow and stay intrested. I found my mind wandering because of the lack of action and diffult foriegn words. I wouldn't have picked to have read this book myself (school assignment) but after i suffered through the boredom of reading it, I found that the moral of the story is a good one to learn, be thankful for what you have and work with it!"
3,Don't remember,unfortunately i don't remember much of this book...I think the style of writing was dry. Or perhaps it was the subject matter.
2,An okay book.,"I thought The Door in the Wall was a mediocrer book;it lacked description of the characters and places. For an example, the book did not describe what Robin looked like; was his hair black or brown, and so on. I was not able to go ""into"" the story.I thought the plot was pretty good, but the only way I was able to actually go ""into"" the story was to look at the pictures, that didn't look so good in black and white."
1,BORING!!!!zZzZzZ,"This is a pitifully BORING piece of Literature. I usually read books that skinny in an hour or two, but this book took me practically a month because I was sooo bored. I fell asleep every time I started reading it. The only good thing about this book was that it helped me catch up with my sleep. I recommend this book for anyone who has to catch up with their sleep."
1,A booring book.,I read this book in the 6th grade cause it was assigned for a book report. It is not a good book at all. If you are thinking of buying it I would reconsider.
1,The Door in the Wall,This the worst book i have ever read. if you like no story line no action and no climax this is the book for you.everyone else it is a waste of time.
2,An Undeserved Yearling Award,"The Door in the Wall by Marguerite de Angeli was a book I was required to read for the summer, and I greatly disliked it (Basically hated beyond all comprehension). It certainly did not deserve a Yearling Award. Considering it was written by a 40 year old woman in the seventies in Michigan, it has absolutely no historical value. If this book were, maybe, Shakespearean, or something, I would appreciate it. I found the ""old talk"" in the book very annoying, and it did not add any charm or romance to the story. In conclusion, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! And if you do, I warn you that this story lacks plot, captivity and any type of entertainment possible!"
3,The Door in the Wall,"I would love to review this book, however, Amazon could not figure out the intricacies of the US Postal service so I never received it. Nor could they figure out how to inform me there was a delivery problem until after the book was sent back. Of course in the interest of E- commerce they make it nearly impossible to contact anyone. Links to no where. I ordered it from Borders and it arrived in 3 days."
1,Yawn...,This is the most boring book in the whole world. I had to read it with my class. We all hated it. You should not buy this book because it is very dumb.
1,Not that Great of a Book,"The Door in the Wall wasn't that great of a book. The way the the characters talk is very confusing to the reader and can become annoying after a while. The story plot is hard to follow, even if you're a teenager. Overall, I think this book is so over-rated."
1,BORING!,"I'm sorry, but this book was one of the worst books I've everread. I read it with my class last year and we all complained aboutit. So, save you're money and go buy a more exciting book."
4,I thought the book was ok.,"It was assigned in 6th grade for English class. I woudn't pick this book to read,but I had to. I also thought it was different from any other book I have read. Door In The Wall had language as they would have spoken in those days. The book did keep me reading more and more. I think it's a good book for kids who like new kinds of stories."
5,Reviewed by a 11-year-old boy - awsome!,"This book was great because it was very inspiring.The main character,Robin, can not use his legs and uses crutches instead. Due to the plague all his servants left him. So a friar named Brother Luke takes him into his care. At the end Robin finds the Door in the Wall. The characters seem real when reading it. If you want to know what the Door in the Wall means you will have to read it."
5,The Door in the Wall by Marguerite DeAngeli,"This is an absolutely outstanding book, both because it is a great story and because it is so well written. It is one of the books that I have read aloud to many children, and it is as interesting to the adult as to the child (age 6-12). Robin, the young lad in this Mideaval tale, has lost the use of his legs from a wasting fever, and as he was supposed to join the household of a family friend as a squire, he feels that life has stopped for him. The monk who has cared for him in his illness, assured him that there is always a door in the wall, and encourages Robin to find it. The rest of the story is an adventure as Robin grows in both heart and skill, and finds that he is indeed able to find the door."
5,Wonderfully Cute Story,"This was a very cute story about a girl whose parents want to begin home schooling her. She spends the summer getting used to the idea, while solving a mystery with her friend."
5,Happy,I really liked the book. It made you feel like you were in a good mood when reading it. The family scenes were touching and I completely enjoyed it.
5,cute,"The story was really cute. It combines kids, dogs, gymnastics and a mystery. And on top of that the main character was moving from public school to home schooling."
1,It is not what you think,"Caveat Emptor. Take it from Bronco Bill, this is not the original music you're looking for. They are all remakes, and like Bronco Bill said Ricky Nelson is missing from the Dean Martin track. Nice art work, but misleading. C'mon now, anyone who knows RAWHIDE, knows Sheb Wooley (the purple people-eater guy) didn't do the Rawhide theme. What you want is out there, it's just hard to find."
2,The Difference Hurts,"If you are a fan of the movie Rio Bravo, and what you are looking for is the songs you heard, as you heard them in the movie, then stay away from this product. I didn't listen to the other reviewers, thinking it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. The difference between these versions and the movie tracks is so pronounced that it is very upsetting. I only listen to the tracks from other westerns. Those at least have some value."
1,awful!,"I buy a lot of items on Amazon. Usually, the products are what the description states them to be. Not the case with this 'Pro Practice Mannequin Hand'. The fingers do flex but they do NOT hold their pose. To state otherwise is flat out lying. Amazon should remove this item from their page."
1,Do not purchase this,I was looking forward to getting this; however it had arrived in a torn box and the stand was broken. The fingers are not flexible like it had described in the description. I am disappointed and returning it. They are completely unprofessional.
1,Fingers do not stay bent nor retain any other position than the one in the picture,"I bought this item because it was clearly stated in the description ""practice hand with flexible fingers... Fingers can be bent and adjusted. They retain position until you move them.""Fingers certainly do NOT stay bent, not a second!! This is basically a hand shaped soft and somewhat thick rubber balloon filled with air)You will end up with this one and only shape.I do not recommend it if you are looking for bendable fingers that retain position!!!Plus, no nails."
4,Slow as molasses in January,"Slow is understating it. Moody. Reality not always obvious. Payoff of plot meager. Yet, I enjoyed it, dammit. Did I actually stay awake through it?"
2,A mystery that slowly reveals that it makes no sense,"There seems to be no theory that can explain what happens in this movie that fits all the facts portrayed. It reminds me of the later episodes of ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Lost"" - the story starts to go off the rails, and you realize it has gone beyond anything the writer can do to justify the previously revealed facts.SPOILER ALERT: The first half of the movie shows two characters who have just met each other; halfway in, there is a scene where the characters pretend to be married, and then the second half of the movie shows the same two characters, but now they have been married for 15 years. It's interesting in a way, but you'll be disappointed if you expect it to come together in the end and make any sense."
2,Two stars for the fact this was made in Tuscany,"Where should I start?Were they married fifteen years ago?Is he the son's father? If he is, why does he care so little about him?Does he live in Italy or in England?Is she married to someone else?Are they playing a part - real life imitating art?Did she know him before the lecture? If not, why does she refer to the fact that he forgot their anniversary?If he is a stranger, why would she take him to a hotel room to show him the room where they spent their first night as husband and wife fifteen years ago?Thank goodness nothing happened in the hotel room. That would have only made the story even more ridiculous.The film raises more questions than it answers. There is no resolution to the many questions thrown into the air. Just a lot of perplexing dialogue that becomes stranger the more the film progresses.I can't say this is a well made film - watch if you have nothing better to do with two hours of your life."
2,Oh my.,"Nice scenery. Moves at a snail's pace and... good script? Really? I wondered in a few places if they were improvising... badly. The wild swings in mood of both main characters is so contrived, it's laughable. You don't care about or like either of these people. Really, don't waste your time."
4,Interesting movie,Movie has substance. I really like about any movie Juliet is in. A bit sad but it's worth watching.
2,Certified Crap,"I'm a big fan of Juliette Binoche movies, I can't claim to have seen them all but I've seen most and it's a credit to her and the movies that she chooses to do that I finally have come across one that made me want to open up a vein. This movie couldn't claim my attention in the first requisite 10-20 minutes that I usually give a movie... I stayed with it because of Juliette's proven track record. Then the plot kind of threw me for a loop and piqued my interest... and soon I wanted to take that loop and tie it around my neck. This movie is like the relationship between the two main characters... something that just didn't work and shouldn't have happened in the first place."
1,Thank God it Cost Us Nothing,"Our first streaming Prime movie-- What a dud. We watched way too long, (the end must have been near) but finally pulled the plug on it."
1,"Boring, Senseless","I was excited to view this movie as I am a fan of Juliette Binoche. What an incredible let down. To say this moves at a snail's pace is giving it too much credit. What appears to start out as an interesting premise, quickly devolves into a totally boring nonsensical ending. The ""plot twist"" makes absolutely no sense and splits the movie into two parts that have nothing to do with each other. The characters are shallow, boring and have absolutely no depth. You have absolutely no affinity for either of them. I strongly discourage anyone from bothering to watch this disaster."
3,"Good, but not the best","The series seems to be fading as it goes along. In ""Saraband for two sisters"" the story line follows with Angelet and Bersaba, the daughters of Tamsyn. The book was fairly predictable and relies too heavily on old story lines used by Carr. I also wonder why they never get in touch with the rest of the family i.e. the new Lord Remus, and the Pennlyons and such.In any case, the story is told by both (twin) sisters and is easy to follow, if not completely satisfying. I would still recomend this book especially if you have an interest in the series. It manages to keep your interest if only to find out what happens so you can read the next one....which I'm about to do."
2,Not for me,"I just really don't like how these fit or work. They are too big even for a 3 'n half inch base and it is cumbersome and awkward trying to fit it into the basket. And, I don't understand having to fold the corners over...this, to me, would seem to make the brewing take longer. I have never used them this way and just used scissors to cut them down to the size of a regular (Bunn) round percolator filter. This works just fine and I will not buy these again."
3,They work.,"These work as advertised. My main beef is that you will need to sort of tuck this paper filter into your basket. If the basket is wet at all, or if you are not careful, the center hole tends to tear (rendering the filter mostly useless). So far I have made about 10 pots of perked coffee with these, the coffee was excellent. I did ruin three filters (in ten, so far) with my clumsiness. I will use these, and enjoy the results. After I finish these, I will order the simple circular filters. Your results may vary. ;)ken"
1,Melitta Percolator coffee filters,"I purchased these percolator filters to go with a percolator pot that I ordered at the same time...thinking that it would be cleaner and easier to handle the grounds....I hate them! They're more trouble than they're worth!...I couldn't get them to fit right, and made more of a mess trying to use them!...will never try them again!"
2,Don't like it.,It's not very easy to put into the coffee maker and does not save me that much trouble in cleaning. It makes the coffee much weaker so I have to use quite a bit more coffee.
2,Percolator Coffee filters,"Great idea, but very difficult to use, especially when you have arthritis in your hands as I do. They tear very easily when adding coffee. They do make the coffee taste better and alot less grounds in the coffee."
1,BEWARE,IF YOU ORDER THIS ITEM YOU WILL BE GETTING ENOUGH FILTERS TO LAST YOU THRU THE NEXT CENTURY. ORDER WISELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,don't waste your money,Good quality filter paper but not worth the money afterall. I found them somewhat cumbersome to lay down into the basket and they really didn't accomplish anything that a regular pleated basket filter wouldn't do. Just poke a hole in the basket filter and use that in your percolator basket.
3,Good but not perfect,These definitely keep the grounds out BUT the coffee seems weaker than usual because I think the water flows around the filter. I added more coffee to the basket and that seemed to help but now I'm using more than I normally would and that's just wasting coffee. I may try and use without closing the top of the filter next time and see how that does.
2,filters for corningware coffee pot,I have been using another company's filter for my on stove perk coffee pot for 42 years. I can no longer get them so I ordered new ones from Melitta and don't like them. Way to thick to get them in the basket of the pot. I use them because I have so many and don't have the paper to returm them and I use to filtering my grounds with fold around wraps.
2,"Great idea, poor performance","These really keep the grounds out of your coffee but they also keep the water out of your grounds. The water flows through the paper filter and around the coffee grounds. Since I bought a case of them I use one to cut a disc filter that I place on TOP of the coffee grounds, as the problem is the grounds floating out of the basket. Sure sometimes there a few grounds in the coffee but I have full strength coffee! Now that I am using a percolator to make my coffee I can't stand the taste of drip coffee! I don't understand how we have let these fine coffee makers almost become a thing of the past.I have a Presto 12 cup percolator and the holes in the basket are rather small. These filters may work better in another brand percolator that with larger basket holes."
5,Melitta coffee filters,This product is excellent. You get no grounds in your coffee. I have a percolator which we think makes the best coffee and there is no other product that can compare to this one for your percolator.
3,percolator filter,"image is misleading. basically, just a flat square of filter paper with a hole in the middle. you end up stuffing it down into the basket and it sometimes makes the water run around the grounds (instead of through them). Would like them to make a pre-fit filter paper ""cup"", but they do not."
3,"Melitta Coffee Filters for Percolators, White Wrap Around, 40 count","These fit well in either stove top or electric percolators. The trick to putting them into the coffee holder in the coffee pot is counter intuitive. One needs to crumple up the filter first, then sort of straighten it out. This makes it less stiff, and more flexible so that when one puts the filter into the coffee holder, the hole in the center of the coffee filter doesn't rip apart as one slides the filter a short way on the coffee stem pipe. It would have been great if Melitta made or offered a nonWhite filter (an unbleached one). Otherwise, these were well made and reasonably priced."
5,coffee filters,The Melitta Coffee Filters are great for our coffee pot. I have been looking all over for wrap around coffee filters so that the grinds do not get into my coffee. I finally found them on Amazon.
5,satisfied customer,I looked every where for percolator filters! Melitta came to the rescue to buy them on line. Thank you for such a good wrap around filter.
5,Good Find.,A real bang for your buck...You get plenty for the value..Great for the older versions of coffee makers. Better pricing than your local stores.
5,Can't find them anywhere around here.,"I bought Melitta filters for my mother, who is 87 and likes only perc coffee. No store in this area sells wrap around filters for perc coffee makers. It's a waste of time and gasoline driving hither and yon trying to find them. The filters are perfect for her coffee maker. I thank Amazon.com again for Amazon Prime and one click. There are many other items that fit this same category. It seems that when one store stops selling a item, they all do."
5,algebraic geometry by hartshorne,"Other reviewers have said a lot worth saying. This is a very good, five star book, but it has flaws. It is fine for an ambitious beginner (and I think it is actually good for that purpose), but even he or she must find other sources, and expect an exciting time, but very rough waters. There are things that this book simply does not teach well. Once you finally figure them out, you will usually find them somewhere in here, tucked away, usually crammed in what looks like a ridiculously pithy statement in a little tiny corner of the page. Then after you are over your initial white hot anger you will be happy that now you know where to find it in Hartshorne. And after awhile you might even start liking the way Hartshorne wrote it. And so it goes!"
2,Unfortunately a better book on the subject doesn't exist.,"The motivation is nonexistent, and the examples are trivial. If you want to learn anything you have to trudge through exercises which require techniques that are not addressed in the text. I don't mind working to learn a subject, but spending two hours trying to understand what a question is asking is a bit much.The best, and most concise review I have ever heard was, ""Hartshorne is the worst book on Algebraic Geometry, except for all the others""."
3,a mixed bag,"A young adult (grades 5 and 6 reading level) collection of stories about werewolves. The weakest of the collection are the formulaic, unoriginal stories (teen wolf, a wolf camping trip). The strongest twist the werewolf folklore (some very aware of the lore) into new meaning (particularly two that deal with parallels to anti-Semitism and another that deals with the Children's Crusade) to create original tales. Not particularly deep, but a good collection for young readers. Grade: B"
2,Wierd Color Reads,"The scanner does its job in the very basic sense, however, I have had mine for 3 years and the last year it has started to scan red tones on all of my images. Also, it scans things very bleached out and loses detail. (Even after adjusting brightness/contrast). I am buying a new scanner as I use it for artwork and cannot put up with these problems anymore."
3,A little too simple,"The title phrases are two of 5 hormone 'types'. The type scheme include:Adrenaline junkiesSerotonin seekersCranky on cortisolShort on melatonin (insomnia)Sugar Sensitive (insulin issues)To determine their 'type', the reader is invited to take a battery of tests. Do you feel groggy in the morning? Do you think loving thoughts about your kids while driving home, then snap at them upon arrival? Based on the results, a variety of diet and lifestyle options are suggested.I wasn't convinced the author's battery of tests were particularly helpful. Biometrics (measuring insulin and cortisol levels, for example) are much more informative. Additionally, the subject hormones all work together. One can't change one without having an impact on the others. These interactions are never explored.If you are interested in how these hormones interact, with a view towards balance, take a look at 'The Age-Free Zone' by Barry Sears."
1,Incomplete recording,"This particular version of the film is incomplete. The tape ends right in the middle of the movie, literally end of the spindle ends. Unless mine was a fluke copy, which I doubt, the whole movie is not on the tape, which is lame, because you're going to want to see where this film goes. The movie itself is pretty good and weird, but this release of it is the pits."
5,Great read!,A great read - and first hand account of a young woman's adventure through PNG. I'm sorry that other's had to post negative comments about this book. Definitely worth reading!!!
2,Does this women need help?,"Please take me to task if I am wrong butMs. Salak seems to be a bit funny in derkopf. On one page she is very angryabout the superstition concerning awoman's period being evil(this is thethinking in tribes in New Guinea)thenshe decides to walk back and forthamongst the men and try to spread 'theevil.' Then the next page she is nakedin a lagoon. She is swimming with a man.Then she comments, ""I now know how Evemust have felt in the Garden.""(!)"
3,hard times to come,"for kira salak in pngit feels good that kalak doesn't hide the somehow ""stupid"" mistakes she made during her journey (trying to track through the highland jungle with a heavy backpack...).still it feels pretty authentic and personal.you can either admire or feel sorry for salak for what she did there and why she had to do it."
1,four corners,I thought book would be strictly about the native tribes. It was about some lame adventure.
5,Best book I read all year,"This book was fabulous. It kept me riveted from page one. What Ms. Salak accomplished in New Guinea (with her intelligence, guts, wit, courage and luck) is truly amazing. Hands down the best book I read all year. A true travel adventure."
3,"Passing insights about PNG, way too much about Ms. Salak","If you are a friend of Ms. Salak and want to know more about her inner life, then I recommend this book highly. For the rest of us, her personal identity struggles and self diagnoses get old really fast. Like many travelogues, because she passes much too quickly through the areas that are her stated theme of the book, one doesn't really get to know much about the people and places; it is mostly an ""author as hero"" kind of book. If you'd like to know more about this area of Papua New Guinea, I suggest the very readable ""The Gebusi: Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World,"" by Bruce Knauft."
5,Cool book!,"Of all the digital photography books that are out there -- and there are plenty -- I was fortunate to have happened upon this one. Most of the 50 projects in this book are top-quality and described in a very easy-to-follow manner. Scrapbooks, personal stationery with a watermark, fine art prints, greeting cards, photo calendar, recipe cards, slide shows, a professional portfolio -- they're all here and illustrated with superb photos. The book also contains a lot of information about editing photos digitally, sharing over the internet, etc. This book will keep me busy and creative for some time to come. (Would make a great gift!)"
3,50 FAst Digital Photo project,Not exactly the book I was hoping it would be. Useful for crafers rather than artists.
4,A truly tour to the Mediterranean,"Excellent traditional Mediterranean music!!I used it for a Mediterranean project at college, everyone enjoyed it, especially the professor loved the music!!"
3,Too much packaging,I selected this multipack of post-it notes because it did not appear to be individually wrapped -- if I'm buying 24 packs I really don't need to open 24 individual packages!!!Unfortunately it IS individually wrapped. In which case I should have just gone with my second choice -- the multipack of recycled post-it notes.
1,Eh...,"Young women are dying in very gruesome deaths in an apartment complex, and one of the tenants feels that she is somehow involved that because of her past she has made this monster come to hurt the women of her building. I really can't say too much more about this book without giving away too much of the plot.This book was horrible. It was so bad that I had to find out what happened to the characters. The heroine annoyed me to no end, but I had to find out what was going to happen to her. It didn't help that 100 pages into the book I already knew who the killer was and why it was happening.I had to read it for myself just to see if I was right. I will give Ms. Reed points for trying to make something new and interesting, but she failed to get me to care about the characters, and despite having a plot that could have been superb, it was weakly executed. She could have really had a winner with this one."
5,Brilliance! A Shining Light Thrust into a Dark World...,"O'Rourke is a genious! My older cousin (a friend of the author) passed a copy to me. I almost felt myself drawn into the group...one of the girls, and as such, felt I was in peril for how the plot turned. This is not a read for the weak-hearted.Eunice"
2,I saw pink,"This was an interesting read. O'Rouke shows room for improvement in her book. Some parts of this book were predictable to me but she appears to be a novice writer. However, the idea of women wearing pink sheets was a wonderful idea that puts extra character into the story. I would say this is an easy read but not one who is looking for a light-hearted read."
4,Song listing,"The copy of ""Belly Dance from Morocco"" that I have has a different track listing. It's the same album that is pictured here. The track listing that my cd has is:1.Khamsa We Khamsine2.Taarida Hawzi3.Genawa4.Shelha5.Solo Darbuka6.El-Andaloussi7.Taarida Shaabi8.Zayani El Rifi9.Genawa Rhythm10.Oud Improvisation"
3,Not what I expected,"I should have paid attention to the date this was made. It is quite old so the technology isn't what I've become accustomed to. Also, the acting wasn't really that great and the story was unbelievable (truly not believable.) Not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it."
1,Casting the Runes DVD,"I was really disappointed in this DVD and returned it to Amazon. This is an old production which is evident in the transfer quality to DVD as well as the corny production which jumped around and used loud music to denote fear. I found it difficult to even sit through the piece, although I felt compelled to see if it got any better, which it did not. As far as I am concerned the production is not eerie, scary, or even interesting. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,casting the runes,Disappointing story and acting. Dated. Badly written acted and directed. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone at any price.
5,Buy this printer,"This is an excellent printer, you won't be disappointed. I run this on a Linux network, without trouble. The configuration tool runs under Windows, so you'll need to have a Windows machine handy to run it."
3,Broken 2 times out of 3,"I ordered 2 sets of these dishes. 1 arrived fine and we obsolutely love them. #2 arrived broken, Amazon replaced it ASAP. However they replaced it with another set that came broken. Now they don't know if they can replace it a third time because it's a ""widespread"" problem. Dissapointing because I do love the set I have. Looking around at reviews of the other corelle pieces I wanted, a lot of them are coming broken to."
5,Love my new dishes!,The dishes came packed perfectly and none broken. They are beautiful dishes - the colors are so pretty and subtle. I love having them in my home. I have used them in the microwave and they are fine. A very satisfactory purchase!!!
4,A great pop album,"Regardless of being christian or not, all the pop songs on this album are superbly composed and performed by Article One. Not even a single song here is to be put aside.It's really worth to acquire and listen to this record over and over, as I've been doing."
2,For the Serious Article One Fan,"Article One is made up of a great bunch of guys. I bought the CD when I found out that they were going to be playing at our church. The sound on the CD is okay, but I could never quite figure out what message the songs were trying to get across. It took playing the CD many times before I started to like it.Boy was I shocked when I heard the songs on the follow-up CD -- Colors and Sounds. I liked most of the songs the first time I heard them and the lyrics are fantastic on most of the songs.So, unless you are a die-hard Article One fan I recommend that you skip this CD and buy Colors and Sounds instead."
1,UMMM,"I can't begin to describe how boring this album is. I saw them recently at shoutfest and was so bored with the cd. Good band live, and that is why I bought the cd.Enjoy them live and stay away from the cd."
2,Design and size good....the rest is marginal,"I like the design and size but have been very disappointed that I can't get the smell of paint out of it. Fortunately, I'm not using it for bread or other food products. I'm using it as storage on my counter for vitamins and various other small items that are in jars or bottles. I thought when we were finished using it for the current purpose, I would use it for bread. But now I question whether that will be possible."
1,Pomerantz Bread Box,"I, too would like to be able to review this bread box but item continues to be unavailable. When I search for the product, the sites are still up that redirect me to sites to purchase the product only to get the message that the product is unavailable. If the product is not available those sites should be removed. I unfortunately am forced to buy a similar box at another store, although I don't like the frosted glass in that one as well. It appears a lot of sales are being missed due to this product not being unavailable."
1,Nothing to Review,"I would love to be able to give you an honest review of this bread box, unfortuntly it was on back order for so long, I finally had to cancel my order. I was patient for over 2 months, but the holidays were coming and I could not wait any longer."
3,Not bad for small jobs.,"Bought this one for only $20 on sale at Ace Hardware with the intention it would be for quick jobs - and that is what it is good for. If you have a little bit to whack here and there, this will do the job. I get about 10 minutes of time out of a charge on the battery.This is a very light-duty weed wacker for small jobs. It works pretty well. Though I don't think I'd pay much more than $35 for it. Just my 2 cents."
1,"do not bother, you'll only get mad","i got the electric Power Glide, so i don't even have the troubles of a dead battery.. the thing is a piece of junk... first time review ever.. but i had to tell, this is just not a good piece of equipment.."
2,Shirly Ann O'Brannon's CD,"I was in 3rd grade when she was my music teacher at school. We were all wondering where she went after she was fired. WE FOUND HER NOW! She put her belt up soooo high...and used too much eye-shadow. THE BELTS WERE KILLERS! Even though we had bad memories, her music is ok. I am not a big fan of tekno funk. It sounds cool.BUY IT IF YOU LIKE! :-)"
2,its okay,"Even though this woman is wierd, she does have a good voice. provided that she hits the right notes. However, the lyrics are out of the ordinary. her music is different. i personally would not buy the CD, but i am sure someone will like it. we all have to have tolerance (or ear plugs) if you like the CD buy it beacuse she deserves to know if she has what it takes."
4,Doug's Great Uncle Tom Sumpter,"This book about Thomas Sumpter (original spelling of his surname) has proven to be not only interesting, but has also revealed important information about my great grandmother, Anna Sumpter's older brother, Tom Sumpter, when they both grew up on Preddy Creek in old Louisa and Orange Counties, Virginia in the mid 1700's (today's Albemarle County); Tom Sumter was closely associated with two other relatives and well known Indian Fighters, Frontiersman, and Revolutionary heros, Colonel Benjamin Cleveland and Colonel Joseph Martin. The three of them were the local characters of their day, and each had exciting lives and adventures. The book is well researched, very revealing, and contains little known facts about the life and times of Thomas Sumter, the Gamecock of South Carolina. Robert Bass is to be commended for his excellent work.Doug LandStafford, Virginia"
2,Not a great product,"This is sort of an example of getting what you pay for. Sure, it's big and cheap, but it also tends to fail a lot. Mine worked very well for a few months but by the time a year rolled around it was failing constantly. It does things like not processing entire pictures, slowing down the save speed and therefore how quickly pics can be taken, and just ceasing to function all together. I fear using it now because I expect my pictures to be lost, so it just sits in my camera bag. I'll probably throw it away. Did I get my money's worth? Probably, but I think you can get a much better deal by buying a better name-brand card."
5,MY favorite converge album.,"even though petitioning the empty sky seems to be the favorite of most, my favorite converge album is definitely this one, when forerever comes crashing. noisy yet technical guitarwork ala rorschach, fast drumming, and plenty of psychotic vocals. this album may be hard to get into at first due to the insane vocal stylings of jacob bannon (coupled with the fact that in many songs he has tons of effects added to his voice) but after awhile, they really grow on you, and the aggressive chaotic music is some of the best out there. fewer emotional breakdowns on this album, but there is an all out melodic song (ten cents) to provide some depth. all in all this album is just pure innovative chaos, not for the weak-hearted. and if these guys ever come near you, i highly suggest seeing them. they rock hard live.fans of converge should check out acme, cave in's older material, and barrit, if they haven't already."
5,best converge album to date,"for any serious post-hardcore metal fan, this is a must have. Very heavy, chaotic, and technical. The kings of crush-matal. Very influenced by slayer. But that isn't a bad thing. If you get a chance, see them live. You will be a changed man. My only complaints are the anti-Diety, hate-full lyrics. Very disturbing."
4,Blue & the Gray on the Nile,A fascinating story of a little-known part of US engagement with the Middle East. Well worth the time.
4,Warm-Hearted Fun,"A regional, independent film with some surprisingly good performances & a decent script. Set in a poor trailer park in West Virginia, the residents each have a fantasy about transcending their bleak lives. The community pulls through at the end (it's a bit corny, but what the heck)! Cameo appearances by country-western singers Johnny Paycheck, Webb Wilder, T. Graham Brown and Porter Wagoner as the Governor of West Virginia! Wrestler Dusty Rhodes turns in a decent acting job as the Sheriff."
2,Skull Bag,"Rockabilly Skulls Stars & Cherries Handbag Purse ClutchI don't think this bag is made particularly well for the price, but my neice just ""had to have it"", and so I purchased it for her. We'll see how long it lasts. Personally I think $5.00 would have been a must more fair price."
1,poor man's WEDGiTS?,These blocks are poorly made - they crumble and fall apart. You can actually stick your fingernail through the blocks! Next time I'll buy the real thing :(
2,Not what I was expecting,I agree with the other person that this was a somewhat dissapointing CD. All instrumentals and no real content. Nice beats to listen to and chill with but otherwise nothing special.
3,Good features; may have quality issues,"The wireless router/ap include good logging features. Many entry level units of this type do not have these funtions. This is very easy to setup for the novice.I am partially convinced that these units have quality issues. The wireless portion on a friend's Netgear MR814v2 stopped working. The router that I purchased was returned due to a similar problem; there was definately a malfunction as some LED lights stopped working after several days. The switch portion remained active, however. If the units did not have any problems, I would have given this 5 stars."
2,Not a long lasting product,"Easy to setup and use. Good connections _initially_. However, product quality is low and support is horrible. After 4-5 months of use with this router, I am going back to my old Belkin router. The reason being dropped connections and expensive support options with the Netgear router.Recommend this for short term and experimental usage."
5,Great wireless router,"This router offers a lot in a small, good-looking, easy to use package. There are countless security features (MAC address filtering, WEP, Firewall, etc.) and it has VPN passthrough, allowing you to telecommute.I have not had any problems with this router crashing in the 2 years that I've had it. The only problem was once it seemed to be running very slow because all of my network traffic was crawling along at only a few MBPS. But after resetting the router, everything worked fine and I haven't had a problem since.Overall, this is a SUPERB router at a SUPERB price. I highly recommend it"
1,do not buy,The router has not worked since the day I bought it. Technical support sucks! Don't waste your money.
2,not for the little ones,"I'm all for science and would be fine explaining to my 2-year-old that frogs eat butterflies, but the fact that this is set up as a love story first makes it rather disturbing when the lover eats the beloved. Funny for an adult, yes -- I told my husband, ""You've got to read this!"" -- and well-written. Not for the little ones, though."
1,What on earth was the author thinking?,"This has to be one of the WORST kids books ever written!Maybe this book would be good for someone who was recently dumped but i think it is a HORRIBLE book for kids! And should not be geared towards kids, especially kids as young as kindergarten!"
1,"change happens, but what a surprise","Well written, but not for 4-5 year olds at bed time. My kids eat ducks, deer and fish and I and we kill. We know about reality. But this is not a good bedtime story. There is one thing for a frog to eat to survive or a hunter to eat what he kills, but a frog to accidentally eat the love of his life?"
1,not for under 6,"this is the retarded book i have seen, i could not read last page to my daughter who is 3. it was shocking, though its animal world, author is showing human emotions through them so little children are going to associate the end with human behavior also.its so not right for delicate minds....."
2,What was the book designer thinking?,"The book is designed so that the print on the pages is a 90 degree turn from it normally would be. I suppose they wanted to be creative and different, but it just doesn't work. To read the book, you need to hold it open long-ways, so the pages are laid out like a wall calendar. It is not easy to turn the pages. I can't believe the School Library Journal reviewer didn't even mention this."
4,Film Music Breaks Free,"As moving Congo rhythms, reflective vocals and choral chants serve the foreground, a striking symphonic palette builds all around. With a magnificent dynamic range, by turns restrained and bold, the music describes a journey toward Congo's political independence, and the story of its leader. It is a powerful blend of African culture and European dramatic tradition, well beyond its share of mediocre passages."
4,A practical set of rules for a new project manager,"This is a book that I wish I had 10 years ago when I was starting out managing major business development projects - the checklist model is sound and works to cut away risks.It has an engineering bias but can be refocused to business development - but this requires some existing experience of project management to secure the maximum benefit.If there is a negative, the book is a little thin - both in size and in business examples.It is worth a place in a serious project manager type of business role."
1,Be sure to buy a magnifying glass to read the examples!,"I bought this book online and didn't realize how utterly unreadable the examples are. I literally have been using a strong magnifying glass to read the code examples (hard to do and type, too). The files are not absolutely consistent with the book either, which can make it difficult in spots to follow along. Sorry, but I also now agree with others that the ""makeovers"" aren't so amazing. I'll keep it as a reference for a couple of ""how-to"" topics."
2,Painful Shoes,"Bought this based on the good reviews but I ended up with major and painful blisters after a short distance. The leather front is actually very tough and so, buyers beware!"
2,Ston-O-Max Exerciser - maxed out - sadly,"I was excited to try this as advertised. Amazon had the best price.The vibrating belt felt like it was doing something to abs, and themassage mode was good on the back. But then it stopped cold dead.The LED control showed working but the heater/motor didn't respond.Disappointed, I was pleased to get a replacement. But again, aftertwice weeks of once-daily use, it also just stopped in mid-use.I think the belt is too heavy and the controls are awkward. Probablyit is the 'heating' element that burns out the motor. Sad, becauseI wanted to see some results after a few months of use. Oh well,I still am on my diet and doing lots more sit-ups now instead. Ratherthan 'shaking' 10-minutes on left flab and another 10-minutes on myright flab and another 10 minutes on abs, I spend 30-minutes doingREAL exercise and feel better about that anyway."
2,Another gadget for the ages,"This is one of those automatic massagers. This should not be marketed for what it claims to be. If you want a massage type belt, this is it. If you think this will make you lose poundage around the waste area, forget it."
1,Ston-O Max Vibration belt,I ordered ONE mashage unit and I received one and started using it. We used it twice and it quit working. The next day we received another one and started using it. It is still working but I was charged for two and there is no phone number or information on guarante on the unit. I would like to return one of the units but the is no phone number any were to get a authorizion number and address of where to return it to.
3,Pre-cursor,"It is not bad for 1998-99, but the new dvds are so much better. Also this VIDEO is very overpriced."
1,waste of time,"I found the book hard to fallow. It never helped me our. Also I paid to much for the set. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone. I don't read that much, and this book was hard to fallow. It realt was. I meen I'm not dumb but it was hard. really hard."
4,A Great Revenge Story,I had been meaning to see this film since it was shown in Istanbul Film Festival few years ago. I had tickets but unfortunately I missed it. Although this film is an animation trust me it is not for children. the story is a straight forward revenge story. The end was very suprising I wasn't expecting the final twist.I Highly recommend this film to people who are interested in independent films. don't expect mainstream revenge stories to have any parallel to the brutality of this film.
3,no good for aluminum,"I bought these on a tip from the internet that they were good for removing gasket material from aluminum engine casings. (The yellow medium grit discs, specifically.) They're not. They don't remove the gasket material all that well and they scratch the aluminum badly. I'm sure there are good uses for these things, but this isn't one of them!"
3,PLEASED BUT DISAPPOINTED,"IM PLEASED WITH THE SHOWER CURTAIN, BUT DISAPPOINTED CAUSE THE DESCRIPTION SAID THAT A CLEAR VINYL LINER WAS INCLUDED BUT IT WASNT. I ORDERED THE SAME THING FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY LAST YEAR AND THE LINER WAS INCLUDED WITH THAT ONE. I WILL BE SURE TO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
1,Run... run while you still can.,"After checking out the reviews for Sidewalks of New York, I noticed that someone who liked that movie recommended, Laughing Boy. Curious, I bought it and then went through the painful experience of watching it. Going back to the positive review, I noticed that the name of the person who raved about Laughing Boy was the same as the director of the movie. So I only have to assume that the positive reviews found here are from the sound guy, camera guy, and the director's mother, respectively."
4,Lots of chuckles -- and some serious ideas.,"The story is about a house party that seems well enough until maverick guy Cody shows up to make fun of all the up-tight people. Even his supportive wife is tested by his shenanigans. Ultimately, he is faced with choosing between his wacky sense of integrity and his livelihood.I expected only a joke-filled, silly, thin plot, because of the first sketch. However, the opening is the least successful part of this film, and the film's true, deeper meaning sneaks in slowly.The true purpose of the film lies in the use of familiar characters that are confronted by issues of social and personal conformity. By use of a good story line, the film is engaging, as well as both funny AND thoughtful.I'd recommend this DVD for the excellent cast and heart-felt production."
2,Phantom Town isn't that great...,"This movie was better then 'Aliens in the Wild Wild West', which also starred young Taylor Locke (who looks and acts exactley the same in both movies) but that still doesn't make it good. The script was cheesy, the acting was weak, and the story was unoriginal. But some parts I found funny and sometimes even creepy. I think little kids would like this movie but don't expect anyone older to enjoy it."
5,Transforming,"The book is very engaging. It reflects the truth about willpower and willing. Resolving is different from surrendering. Desire is basic in willing; choosing God out of desire for God. Surrendering the kingdom of self to the kingdom of God. The concept of taking up our crosses daily is graphic and emphatic. Death is the way to life! The problem is not with one finding the presence of God but being attentive to His presence by turning towards Him in centered and focused prayer. The problem is not with knowing God's will but accepting God's will. God wants to change out choosing not merely our choices. The author is very thoughtful and honest. He is aware of the contributions of others on the subject and makes good and appropriate use of the works and words of others!InBreaking Free: The Key to Empowerment, Happiness & Fulfillmentthe author also speaks of the importance of yielding to God for total healing and restoration."
2,sent not very strong,Did not notice the scent at all. I live in a small condo and could not smell it while buring it.
4,More Bat for your Buck,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son who had become interested in Vampire bats. I was very impressed with the size. 12"" describes the body, the wings are much longer. High quality, soft materials, detailed stiching in the wings and care was taken to give the toy a realistic Vampire bat type nose. I do agree with the other reviewers that the teeth could be better. They are a little beaver like. All in all our family enjoys this toy and it is really very cuddly."
4,Durable,I gave this stuffed toy to my daughter for Christmas two years ago and it is still holding together. So far it hasn't ripped at the seems or shown any signs of wear. This product is well made and is worth the money.
3,NOT the Best Compilation,"Hossam Ramzy's numbers are great (that grand Classic ""AZIZA""...and Sahara Groove) but the rest werenot up to the expectations generated by the title..even though there were many very well-known & respected names....yes...THe BEST of that .... but the numbers themselves were not very inspiring.Perhaps it is just my viewpoint from my ""non-Middle Eastern ears"". It's not a CD I frequently use..either for dancing or listening."
1,Not my best buy,"I bought this cd because I wanted some bellydance music to dance to. I didn't like any of the tracks on the cd and I found it difficult to dance to. This is of course a question of taste and preference, but I prefer the rytmic style of bellydance music. I would'nt recommend this CD to anyone."
5,Beautiful music,"I can strongly recommend this CD to anyone who loves this kind of music. It is so lively, you can listen to it while doing exercises on a static bicycle, while relaxing, anything you wish. It is great. And the bookseller was excellent, too. Thanks Amazon."
4,Best Of Bellydance from Egypt Lebanon Arabia & Turkey,The CD was good and what I was looking for. The only thing wrong was my CD case was all broken up when I received it. But as far as the quality of the music nothing to complain about. :)
4,Contemporary Belly Dance,"This CD has great variety and selection. There's lots of different music to listen to. From the silky ""Ya Cemil"" to the jazzy ""Sahara Groove,"" it's a good cross-section of modern bellydance music. For those who like a more traditional sound, this may not be for you.This is the CD to choose if you like contemporary music to dance to, or want to listen to modern Middle Eastern music. Dancers who prefer traditional stuff will probably not like this. If modern music is your style, there are some terrific selections on Best of Bellydance from Egypt, Lebanon, Arabia & Turkey. Since it's also a compilation CD from other CDs, it's also a good sampler of those other CDs. (The liner notes will tell you where the songs appeared before they were here.)"
1,Not at all what I hoped for.,"Very light on ""ideas"".Yes, you can fry other things in it! Amazing. Who would have ever guessed.A few recipes, true, but a very amateurish booklet.Don't waste your money."
2,disappointed,"about a dozen useful recipes. really, how many of us are going to be making maple syrup in our fryers?"
3,Should be 103 recipes not uses...,"Hello All,I just got this book and have skimmed over the whole thing and it's all about recipes. There are a few mentions about using it as a steamer but all in all it's recipes. I was looking for a more usefull book on how to use the turkey fryers as emergency backup burner, or the use of the burner and how to modify it to get even more hotter like a blow torch effect. Oh well.DOES NOT have any sections on making soups either..."
2,Lame,"I ordered this book for my husbands new toy. Not much for new, inovative ideas...Come on, use the burner on the fryer to make someores!!!!"
5,COOK BOOK,I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT THIS IS REALLY VERY EYE OPENING AT ALL THE USES FOR THE DEEP FRYER
3,oops...wrong suggestioin,Was suggested with a purchase of the Big Easy Infared Cooker. This book is for fryers! Good recipe ideas...wrong piece of equipment match.
5,Guide for the Novice,Suggested item when I purchased my turkey fryer.Lots of delicious recipes for various uses of fryer.Would recommend as a great start for the novice.
2,Not what it seems,"This book was presented with the ""Big Easy"" no oil turkey fryer. It clearly is not for the Big Easy and should not be presented with it. It would be good for a fryer that requires oil as all of the receipes in the book require oil. Amazon is incorrect presenting it as an item to purchase with the ""Big Easy Fryer"""
2,"Okay, not great","It was a decent cookbook with good pointers for frying turkeys, but I don't think it's worth the price plus shipping."
1,Recipe Book Disappointment,"I ordered two of these Recipe books for our sons who have just gotten the Char-Broil Big Easy Oil-Less Infrared Turkey Fryers. This cook book was marketed on the same page as this fryer, which I took to mean it applied to the oil-less fryer. I was disappointed to find it is not - only for the fryer using oil.Good cook book, interesting recipes, but not for the oil-less fryer.Be sure this is really what you want to buy.Thank youChar-Broil 08101480 The Big Easy Oil-Less Infrared Turkey Fryer"
3,103 uses?? I don't think so...,"I was so excited to see a book that would finally get that turkey fryer out of the garage and back to work. This wasn't it. This book was not 103 ""uses"" for a turkey fryer, but 103 ""recipes"" for ONE use...."
5,wow,I like food. You can have a cook out and make new suff that I never made before. Like I said I like food.
5,Turkey Fryer Cookbook,Great ideas in the cookbook for everything other than Turkey Frying! My husband is looking forward to many other uses of the turkey fryer!
3,tales of persia,good book about missionary to persia. good historical facts was a required reading for history class in school.to learn about the area
1,Very Misleading,"Received the camera in the mail today. Searched all over for the card to insert, couldn't find it, called Olympus support. I was informed it doesn't come with a card, that the card must be purchased separately, but that the camera has internal memory for 3-7 pictures. What good is a camera that only takes 3 pictures. No where in the Amazon.com advertising did it convey this information. I am very disappointed and will be extremely wary of future Amazon offerings as a result, and will avoid internet purchasing in general. This is what makes folks suspicious about e-commerce."
1,Rip off!,"I bought the Olympus D-370, reconditioned model and it doesn't work! So, I'm stuck with it! Read the return policy carefully. I'm not a computer dummy so it not the computer! Spend your money elsewhere. I have a $188.00 ""doorstop"" that looks like a camera, if you want to waste it!Mike"
4,good first camera,"This is my first digital camera and I love it so. The, lighting, B&W, sephia options are great. I bought a 128 MB smartcard which takes 200 pictures at SHQ. The Camedia program is easy to load and USB connection is easy to figure out. The only thing, though, is that the camera only comes with and a 2 MB internal memory which means you can only take 3 pictures before you run out of space. Many digital cameras come with an additional 16 or 32 MB smartcard but not this one. With the purchase of a smartcard and battery recharger, the price of the camera is doubled. All in all, though, can't complain too too much, especially since we got the camera as a wedding gift."
3,Easy to Use,"Received this camera as a gift. It is easy to use. With a Smart Card it holds a bundle of pictures so if you were travelling, just bring a bunch of cards along. On the lowest quality (which is still good) the camera hold over 300 pictures. A good buy for the money."
4,A great camera for a great price...,"I bought this as a present for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He has become ""shutter-happy."" It takes great quality pictures (good color and detail), and is very user-friendly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a compact, digital point and shoot camera without having to shell out too much money. The quicktime movie option is really fun. It is great in capturing short, ""moving"" moments that a photo cannot. You just have to make sure you have enough light."
3,Amish Kitchens Home-Style Egg Noodles,"These are the most tasteless noodles I have ever had. I thought they would be good, but they have NO taste whatsoever. I have to donate them to the commoditiy kitchen. Shame, should not have ordered them."
5,Great soup noodles!,"I've been experimenting with various homemade soup and chili recipes in my crockpot this fall and winter, and was looking for a hearty noodle for chicken noodle soup. I thought I'd give these a try, and WOW...are they good! They cook up without sticking together and hold up well in soup, even after being frozen and reheated. I keep 2-1/2 cup portions of various homemade soups in my freezer for a quick lunch, and this is one of my favorites. Great price, too!"
3,advertisement confusion,"anything from the amish clan is going to be good ""eatin"" but the advertisement stated these noodles were wide and they are hardly wide! at best, maybe medium. i always get their kluski noodle and these wide ones are about the same size. i was very disappointed in this product from an advertisement standpoint.wide should be WIDE!"
2,scoobys olympics v 2,"first, i love scooby doo where are you series. second, scooby is an influential inpiration on millions. this is not a series with good morals or values. This show, shows and teaches that good must win even if it means cheating and being bias, and playing favorites. Not entertaining, more annoying than good. bad puns, bad time sensitive material, no education value, run cycles and boring plots. kids will be dumber after viewing, in my opinion"
3,Crimes R Us,"While I've never watched a single broadcast episode of CSI, I've purchased every season set of this core series. Now, the reason I've been purchasing the season sets was because of my initial purchase of the Bones season sets and so I had decided to jump into another crime drama. CSI happened to be that very bet.Now, I've enjoyed the series up until now but I had found this season to be particular dull and it seemed to lack the friendly atmosphere that I had enjoyed from the previous seven seasons. The mix-up of the cast threw me off-balance and it seemed that the characters were bumping around aimlessly with no real purpose. However, overall, the series is still rather enjoyable to watch.The one good thing that fans of this show can expect is that the two-art crossover episode that begins in Episode 806 and concludes in ""Without a Trace Episode 3T6108 - Where and Why"" are both included in this set so there's no reason to buy Without a Trace Season 3."
5,Great product at a great price!!,I was very satisfied with the condition of the product at the price I got it at.
5,CSI Las Vegas,"My children and I like the methods used in sloving a crime. The actors are top notch and come across as actual law enforcement and not just actors playing a part. This goes for all of the CSI Las Vegas series,"
3,CSI The eight season,I was under the impression that when I purchased the DVD's it was new. It was not. The cover was faded and the case actually came off of the DVD set.
2,CSI 8 runs out of steam,"Watched every season every episode so far, Season 8 is hopeless, some episodes are boring and to me were just fillers, You Kill Me in particular, what was that all about, even the first couple of episodes were sparse and self indulgent, as I watched episode after episode I was waiting for that CSI winning formula of old, the only saving grace was the poison dwarf = the short young girl with the big IQ. Has CSI ran its course can there only be so many stories about Las Vegas, there was even one episode that intertwined with Without a Trace that was disjointed. Grissom was god and this CSI was the best series, not sure now as CSI Miami seems to me to more watchable. The characters are worn out and boring, only Jim Brass is ever good, Sara you wont be missed."
5,greaat,"this is great, shame so many of the charcters leave are leaving. will it be the same CSI at the end of next season."
4,Good service,I bought it for my sister and I have not received any complaint so far. So I think she likes it.
2,Difficult to Believe,"Please read carefully. I purchased this dvd from a third party. This makes it difficult to determine if I would say the following had I purchased direct from Amazon. The season had struggles due to the writers strike. The first three discs are episodes that had been repeated during the strike, then the quality of those discs are remarkably different than the remaining discs, they are grainy and unpleasant to watch. I question if the ""new, never used"" description meant???there will be downloads, copies, etc.I should have known..the third party would not reply to my email inquiry..asking exactly that information. CSI's STORY QUALITY remains pristine. I waited a long time before buying the 8th season. At the very least I have the complete collection. Let's hope season 9 will hold up. P.J.Today"
1,yesterday's news,"I was disappointed by this book. I was hoping to get some insight into Italian before traveling there for the first time and found the same kind of pseudoscientific nonsense that charasterized my studies of Linguistics in the late 1980s. I have studied Latin, French, and Spanish, so I might have hoped that I could find an approach to Italian that could skip all the cloudy methphysics that goes into entry-level grammars. Even if you can penetrate the arcane treatment of an apparently overgeneralized subject, you may find yourself asking, ""What's the point?"" in a dialect of English that is alien to these academic types. It was expensive, too."
5,Painting without canvas,"Painting without canvas was what Fr. Bob originally wanted to name the book. I think a better name would be making peace with life.He does a wonderful job of teaching even when he was in such pain and others would feel sorry for him. His words reminded my of Tuesdays with Morrie.He shows that even though we all know that death is coming, to make the most of our time here.It is a short book but it demonstrates his ability to teach adn to command an audience (even of one) very well."
5,Inspiring to all!,"I had read ""Making Peace With Cancer"" when it first came out in 2001. Bob Stewart was one of my teachers at the Franciscan Institute at St Bonaventure University back in 1998. When I had to deal with my own bout with cancer, I returned to the book with a new understanding and appreciation of Bob's message. Over the past few years, I have shared my copy with others who have had to face cancer. They have found peace with their situation by walking with Bob. (Many people have asked to keep the book to pass on to others.) My most recent purchase was to restock my bookshelf so I can continue to share Bob's wisdom and insight with others. Thanks Bob for your life and for your words that live on in these pages!"
3,Fireman Sam: Brave New Rescues,"My Grandson adores Fireman Sam and I have bought many DVDs here and from England. I wish the episode content was published with each DVD information. This DVD contains episodes that are also on other DVDs, thus the 3 stars only. Purchase of Brave new Rescues pushed me towards conducting a research of episode content on each DVD before I buy it. I hope this helps you.It contains: Cry Wolf (also in Towering Inferno in CGI triple pack Towering Inferno / Danger By The Double / S.O.S. Sam [DVD] 2011)Blow Me Down (also in Choppy Waters [DVD] [2011])Dilys's Big SurpriseModel Plane (also in Helicopter Heroes 2011 [DVD]according to research on British Video Assoc.)Open Day ((also in Helicopter Heroes 2011 [DVD]according to research on British Video Assoc.)Mike's Rocket (also in SOS Sam in CGI triple pack Towering Inferno / Danger By The Double / S.O.S. Sam [DVD] 2011"
4,Cute and Teaches Safety,"""Fireman Sam: Brave New Rescues"" is a great DVD for both boys and girls. It not only teaches safety and teamwork but it includes firemen which my boys love! Fireman Sam is also the only show I can think of that features firemen and it also is a show that we always seem to miss on tv. There are six episodes total on the DVD and it definitely occupies my boys, maybe too much since they want to watch it over and over again! The DVD is kid-friendly and for ages 2 and up. Oh and the animation is very bright and well-animated.Episodes:Cry WolfBlow Me DownDily's Big SurpriseModel PlaneOpen DayMike's Rocket"
5,My 2 and 3 yr olds LOVE Sam!,My children love fireman Sam. My 2 yr old got this movie in his stocking this year and loves it. Matter a fact it's on my tv now!
5,Great for little ones!,My grandkids from the age of 2 to 10 have all watched this and love it. It is very educational on fires. My husband is a chief of the volunteer fire department and he likes it for the kids.
4,Never done it before? Start here,"Mr. Lovett starts with the basics, and is careful to include viewpoints not his own. (Most importantly, he includes the words of a female cyclist when discussing topics such as women's safety on the road, hygiene, and clothing selection.) He loves the sport, and it shows in his writing. This is not the advanced treatise that an anonymous reviewer criticized as ""written for morons"" (how brave!), but Lovett does not claim it to be. It is methodical, and it points the reader to more advanced information when it is needed. This is a good book with which to start your touring library."
4,There is a second edition,"Should you decide to purchase this book, condider the new updated 2nd edition which came from two publishers in years 2000 and 2001. ISBN: 0071360190The first edition was in 1994 ISBN: 0070388490"
3,Good,"Good music, would like at least to have English translations of the lyrics so I could understand the non-Engish songs. But like I said the music is still good."
5,Brilliant!!!!!!!!,"One of the best Death Metal bands ever...it is just a shame they are still mostly unknown even in the metal community. What makes them rise above 99% of other DM bands is their unique and original sound...like nobody else...of course you could be unique and suck, but they are unique in a very good way, trust me...check them out you won't be disappointed!!!"
4,Where is the World Going?,"This is a series of short article-type chapters on a whole range of political global issues. It looks at Israel, Al Qaeda, Global Government, mergers of Canada, USA, and Mexico. It relates all that is happening to Ancient Biblical prophecies. It looks at the policies and response of US and UN. It is a book that makes you think, even if you do not agree with some its conclusions."
3,Superhawks Strike Force Bravo,Great story until the ending. What happened to all the main characters? There was no closure. If it were to be continued why weren't readers told that there was a sequel? If its not continued then that was one of the worst endings I've ever read. I'm sorry now I preordered Strike Force Charlie because of the potential same type of ending. Thanks.
3,Decent blues rock jams,"Right out of the gate American Minor summon the sounds of classic seventies rock with ""Walk On"". Rob McCutcheon's vocals bluesy yet slightly weathered, but they suit the music well. Long guitar strums and quick licks control ""Break"". The chorus is catchy and easy to pick up, while the bridge helps set up the melodic guitar solo. The blues rock influences of early Aerosmith and the Black Crowes can be heard on ""Mr. Queen""; a storyteller type of song. ""Shine"" is lead by a sweet, extended guitar lick that's accented by climbing power chords. I loved the subtle guitar and vocal breakdown section. A blaring freestyle solo brings the track to an end. ""Sleepwalking"" has a `jam band' feel to it with its laid back rhythms and vocals.The BadNothing notableThe VerdictWhile American Minor's debut doesn't exactly light a fire under my butt, it does display some decent blues rock jams that combine southern rock and a little bit of country influences."
2,All aerobic,"I was hoping this video would be different-it was all aerobic. I was looking for a workout tape similar to a Jackie Warner, P90X or Jullian style. This is not like that at all. If you're use to aerobics with women changing moves every 10 seconds, you'll love this."
4,Near to Oracle Bible- an eye opener and must for beginners,"Excellent Oracle Tuning book!! Real Eye opener.Starts with MYTHS, Clarifies the FACTS and you live with the FACTS(without myths) FOREVER. Written in simple and easily understandable language. Gaja and Kirti have done a marvellous job.Excellent explaination on complex things like Oracle architecture, SGA, Processes, indexes etc. Real life, live examples and sql scripts. Very good notes on various oracle topics.Different level of tuning and explaination on RAID is one of the best things with all other features.A best buy of mine."
2,Very Basic and found it lot of other DBA books,I thought this book would be great but alas it is same stuff which is found over and over in many books and web pages dedicated to Oracle. I think the matter in the book and cost of the book don't justify. You wouldn't miss anything if you don't own this one. I expected much more from Gaja but it was a disappointment.
3,Incomplete and basic,"I was expecting the book to be more advanced in its coverage of tuning topics. The new Oracle8i features such as multiple buffer pools and STATSPACK are not covered properly. There is nothing special in the book and the tuning techniques discussed can be obtained for a number of other Oracle books and documentation.A ""101 book"" such as this should include some discussion on a ""overall system tuning"" strategy but nothing like that is in the book."
3,MUST USE DRUGS TO ENJOY,"I didn't much care for this CD when I wrote the previous review...and then I had a revelation: to fully appreciate ""Salvation"" it is necessary to be on heroin, or at least presciption painkillers! I mean, the thing is so SLOW we non-junkies can't comprehend its pretentious ""beauty"". I am sure its true genius is revealed when the listener's brain is pumped full of opiates."
2,title of review,"Wow, this is pathetic. Blatant Isis imitation. Not only is the music a second rate Isis knockoff, but the vocals especially sound so much like older Isis stuff. This band is a joke. Well at least we know if Pelican is ever unable to fulfill their duties as redundant Isis wannabes we'll have Cult Of Luna to fall back on. I'd rather listen to Transmission0 though."
5,Expert Instruction,"Pilates is a complicated moving practice and can easily be done wrong. I found this book easy to read and was able to apply the instruction. As a Pilates Instructor, this is one of the few books I would recommend to a client."
4,Overall great book,"I bought this book partly because of the picture on the front. I would much rather have her body than the manly-looking body builders. She looks like a dancer. I am thoroughly enjoying the book, especially her creative ways of describing how you should be positioned, etc. The only drawback for me is that if you are new to Pilates, there isn't a lot of instruction on how often/which parts to do to achieve certain results. I was a little confused as to what made up a full program and what was extras. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase"
5,Getting Started?,"I've been doing Pilates for 3 years now. I did start with some personal one-on-one training. I would highly recommend investing in this before you start your matwork (two to three private sessions should do it.) Then you can move on to matwork exercises. Brooke Siler's book is the best I've seen for covering mat-exercise basics. The illustrations demonstrate how to do the exercise in either ""beginner"", ""intermediate"" or ""advanced"" mode. It's clearly written and very easy to follow. I strongly urge you to compliment your home routine with the private sessions I spoke of before. Although Brooke explains it all very well, there are some very small nuances to doing these exercises correctly that only an instructor can show. Don't skip over the beginning of the book, especially the chapter about ""Key Elements to Mastering the Mat"". This is the section that explains the ""nuances"" that are really key to reaping the benefits of Pilates. Good Luck!"
2,Tried it but ended up painful,"I tried it, but the book is rather convoluted, I find myself confused about the instructions. And I ended up having a sprained shoulder. Dangerous."
4,Easy to follow,"Good introduction, not too wordy. I like the pictures, beginner modifications and explanations about the ""Inside Scoop."" Wish she will write more books."
3,Yes and No,"This book is passionately written, with historical detail and encouragement for the beginner spliced in perfectly.Unfortunately, when it comes to describing the positions--let's take the first position (I can't get past the first!)--Brook has intermittently obscured intervening steps. I.e., #1, #3 and #5 are excellently drawn, but description of #2, #4 and #6 skipped out the back door, leaving the paragraph a cold and windy home for the suddenly bewildered inhabitant."
4,not quite sure,i don't know if i am just dense but i think that this book can be put together better. there was no clear workout for beginner nothing clear except how to actually do the poses... so if that is what you want than this book is for you. if you are new to pilates...maybe a different book.
3,A Caveat to Beginners,"After reading the myriad positive comments on Amazon about this book, and blithely not heeding the advice of some reviewers who mentioned the ""maybe not best suited for beginners"" factor, I forged ahead and ordered it. Although it does offer helpful guidelines to the exercises, I must agree with those aforementioned sage reviewers: the book is not as beneficial to beginners as it probably is to those who have already had some exposure to Pilates. There aren't enough instructional photos to depict the various movements described for each exercise, and the very important section, ""Key Elements to Mastering the Mat,"" isn't as clear and descriptive as it needs to be. Maybe I'm just a quitter (which is undeniably possible :), but I don't feel comfortable using this book to learn Pilates without first getting some formal instruction."
5,One of the best,"As a Pilates instructor I analyze books for my students to use at home. This is one of the Best, with well written and accurate descriptions for form.. and carefully divided into exercises for beginners and advanced. Pilates is precise and it is hard to instruct in book form. This is a great exception; I still recommend a few lessons from a certified instructor"
5,An awesome Pilates book!,"A very good introduction to the exercises of Joseph Pilates. She explains how the exercises relate to the muscles, and the ideas and reasoning behind the workout. I found the book to be very comprehensive. I also liked the book because it is not isolated at a certain level. The modified beginner, full mat, and advanced workouts will allow a person completely new to Pilates to begin exercising, and be a good reference for people at a more advanced level. The reader can work with the book to exercise, rather than having to find something else when s/he is done with the moves."
4,"Practical, effective workout","I've faithfully followed the programs outlined in this book for a year and a half now, much longer than I've ever maintained any other kind of home workout. This book was very well organized, and the instructions and visualization suggestions made it easy for me to teach myself. Helps my low back pain and general muscle tone. The Pilates workout isn't everything one needs for fitness - you still need something anaerobic, like walking, and may want to do something for your upper body as well. But as a daily routine, Pilates seems ideal."
2,not so much,"I had to buy this book for a course on yogalates. I definately was not impressed. This book contained a lot of the basic pilates moves, but it lacked life. The pictures were out-dated and boring, as well as the formatting of the book. I have much other better yogalates books and video. This book was about as interesting as reading an anatomy book or a calculus textbook."
3,I really want to like this book!,"I wish I could be as enthusiastic about this book as all the other readers! I bought it with high hopes, but find that I can't stick with the workout regularly.In addition, I'm disappointed that many components of the workout have to be eliminated if the book purchaser has back trouble (which I do). I'm not sure I'd obtain a well-rounded workout that way.I'd love to make a Pilates routine work for me. If anyone has suggestions, please follow up in your review."
4,The book was just what I wanted,I have enjoyed Brooke Siler's other book The Ultimate Pilates Body Challange so I ordered this one. I enjoyed the fact that it had the main Pilates mat routine in it because that was what I was most interested in. The instructions are very easy to follow.
4,Great Book!!,"This book is excellent in explanation and photos. It's good for those of us who don't have access to a class. I've been doing it for a week or more, and I feel like I'm tightening up some and that my pot-belly is beginning to flatten out. The only thing missing is an explanation of correct breathing, which is found in the Complete Idiot's Guide to the Pilates Method. It seems trivial, but it's so important that Joseph Pilates said that if you don't follow any further instructions, at least learn to breathe correctly. Between the two books, I think I can learn Pilates, though it's gonna take some time. It's definitely not learned overnight but will probably be worth the time it takes to do so."
5,Brilliant!!,"Having no previous experience of ""Pilates"" I found the book very helpful in teaching me the fundemental principles of this extraordinary technique. The book layout is very easy to follow and guides the reader seemlessly through the basic principles to the more advanced. You never feel overwhlemed and each excercise is subtley structured to take you on to the ""next"" stage. The author seems to have judged the audience very well. Having had a personal session with Brooke at the re:AB studio in NYC I can say that the book is just as good as being there!. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for the ""perfect"" mind and body!"
5,This is the best book you can buy!!!,"I started doing Pilates 6 mos ago w/a video tape. I started out in pretty good shape, Ive been working out for 5 years. I started pilates because I heard most pro-sports teams have a Pilates and Yoga trainer on staff. Let me tell you THIS WORKS!!! Weights allways left some areas unattended. Pilates works it all! Its fun to do, and you can see results after every workout. It becomes addictive. Weights became very monotonous, but pilates is never boring. I dropped 2 inches in my midsection and am becoming ripped as heck. This book in particular works like a charm. If you look at the pictures of JH Pilates in the book at age 72 and 82, you'd swear you were looking at a 30 year old below the neck. I'll have Pilates for the rest of my life. In my opinion it is the best exercise availabe."
5,The Pilates Body,"After abdominal surgey my doctor handed me this book. He told me to do only the beginner exercises every day for two weeks. Then move on as I pleased. I'm not used to doctors handing me books, pamphlets yes-books no. So I did as he recomended. After the two weeks I thought ""Why didn't my OB tell me to use this method after I had my daughter?"" I felt results after only a few days, and I saw them by the end of the two weeks. I now practice 2-3 times weekly, and have never had a better looking mid section."
5,Most accurate instruction for classical technique,"Brooke does a great job of giving clear instruction for classical Pilates technique while adding a little extra insight. She provides details that most books don't offer or most authors don't even comprehend. I like her style--it's straightforward and accurate, while giving a visual sketch of how your body should feel during each exercise. Along with a DVD such as Peter Fiasca's Classical Pilates, you can possess the tools to do Pilates effectively in your own home."
4,Worth a read,Good picture demonstrations and instructions. The tips are well worth the book if you are an instructor.
3,Lots of information but need more descritptions,"I found the book good overall, but some of the descriptions of the exercises are not descriptive enough, even with the illustration. I needed to find a demo video online to understand 1 or 2 exercises."
4,A Wonderful Reference but First Take a Class With a Live Instructor,"I use this book everyday, but in reading through the reviews I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out that in the beginning, you must have a live person with expertise to teach you the fundamentals. We moved and I lost my instructor (too far to commute to her classes), and I had already bought the book and then, because of my previous experience, The Pilates Body was perfect."
4,Excellent Guide!,"This guide book is very complete with pictures, visualizations, and thorough directions on how to do the exercises. I especially appreciated the way she marked beginner, intermediate and advanced exercises. She also provided some modified exercises for beginners. However, after using it for four years or so I realized that it is really a stepping stone as Brooke Siler suggests, and should be used as an introduction before attending a Pilates class. I am not near to the fitness levels of Brooke or her models (maybe they're dancers). Without the help of a trainer some exercises are just difficult to execute correctly. So years later I am finally beginning to understand the Pilates philosophy, right as I was ready to move back to weight lifting. Not complete without a live guide or DVD."
1,Unreliable,"I bought a MFC-9700 from Amazon a little over two years ago. For the first year it worked well, and then the scan lamp started to fade on one side yeilding unreadable copies and faxes. A $120 repair fixed that, but then six months later the printer output started having an overall grey background. Brother tech support first suggested a new toner cartridge ($60) and then a new drum ($110) neither of which made any difference. The local Brother service center thinks it's the high voltage power supply, which will run about $150 to replace, that is, if it isn't the main PC board, which would be $230.My advice: save your money and buy an HP. The initial purchase price is just part of the total cost of ownership."
4,Great under Win 2000; dog under XP,"I bit the bullet and moved from XP to Win 2000 with this device. It did not perform well at all under XP -- for example none of the software modules work under XP and the driver seems inefficient. Under 2000 the software works and the printer is engaged faster. I also went with the cable rather than the parallel port and it seems to transmit data faster. I went from being ready to return it to now feeling like it was a good purchase. The printer, after page 1, is quite fast. I recommend downloading both drivers from the Brother website for Win 2000."
3,Nice But!!,"Nice all in one but it will not ""COPY"" to 8x14 without having to reduce the copy to a 8x11. ""Printing"" to 8x14 is AOK. The overall unit is excellent but if legal copying is important buy a multifunction with the ablility to COPY to legal without reducing."
1,Poor print quality.,"When the machine was new, it worked fine. But after printing 1000 pages, there are toner stains all over the printed page. I replaced new drum and toner(cost about $200), but nothing improved.Just like other brother laser printers, this machine has some design or manufacturing defect. The real lifetime of the drum unit is far less than they labled on the manual(20000 pages)."
5,Sooo Funny!,"Laurel and Hardy are so funny comedians. I love this movie especially Jimmy Finlayson who was so funny and best supporting star. I like some part about fighting, and boats flipped over, and police coming to stop the fights. Laurel and Hardy are best ones today and are in my heart forever."
1,Never received chocolate! Avoid!,"Company delivered chocolate, but it was stuck at post office and never arrived. Promised to resend. Product never arrived. Avoid!"
2,Dissapointing,"Chocolates had less flavor that I expected. Good consistency, but flavor is every bit as important as consistency."
4,"It floats, but nicks easily.","As a pull buoy it definitely gets the job done--it floats! It's really pretty boxy-looking, but I do like how one side is bigger than the other for both comfort and amount of ""lift."" What I don't like is that I store this in a mesh bag with all of my other swimming gear and this pull buoy nicks and gouges very easily. It's got small holes and scratches all over it already, but that doesn't affect how it works."
1,Poor workmanship,"This thing looks to be hacked out of a larger piece of foam by hand (by a 3rd grader). It was supposed to have one end larger than the other, but both sides are pretty much equal. No surface is straight/smooth. The whole thing is lopsided. Very poorly made."
3,On taking and follwing,"Robert Aitken's book is well worth reading and does offer useful information, but I disagree that it is for people first taking the path. The book is dry. Some see that as no-nonsense, an important quality is such a confusing arena, but it also is uninspiring. It, further, does not focus on what Zen offers, but is more of a how to follow Zen once the decision is made. If you think Zen Buddhism gives you liscense to ignore societie's rules and standards, this is a must read. If you want advice on meditation, it is a must read. If you are still considering whether Zen is for you, or you aren't sure what Zen is, look elsewhere first."
4,"""In walking the path you draw no nearer and progress no farther.""","Robert Aitken-Roshi (1917-2010) was one of the first ordained Western Zen teachers in addition to being a social activist. This is a brief introductory volume for Americans who have decided to take up the Way of Zen and need a starting point. A primer on the bases of practice, this is also a good book for the more experienced practitioner to revisit from time to time as it presents Zen in a clear, concise and accessible (if somewhat erudite) format. Had the book been available when I first developed an interest in Zen in my late teens, my practice would be far more matured today."
3,the most important Zen teachings,"I have to think that this book incorporates the most important teachings of Zen as it has come to be constituted because this book was given to me by the members of a local Sangha when I attended as a visitor/guest. When I read and review it again I can notice more than I did the first time, both what it contains that I have studied elsewhere, and what I have studied elsewhere that it ignores or glosses over. For example, there is little or no reference to the concept of Purification and the three knowledges that are taught in The Turning of the Wheel lesson, the first sermon of the Buddha. This as I have come to understand is a monumental limitation of Zen, apparently. If the reader wishes to understand more about the turning of the wheel...etc. consider The Path to Nirodha. [...]"
5,very good book on zen ! ! ! ! !,i have to say this is a very good book a joy to read but it does have a few dry points in the book but this is very need info so all in all great book so i gave it a 5 out of 5 joy
5,Warm your Heart - and give yourself and your kids a great life skill!,"On the surface this is a very cute, very heartwarming book about the cutest little Rabbits having pretty crap day and being transported by the magical Bunny Queen janet to a planet where they can experience the day that should have been. But look deeper and you will discover a metaphor for us all - that better feeling thoughts are only a choice away, there for us to reach for any time we like. As each bunny says at the end of each story of the Bunny Planet ""It was there all along"". I'm going to make sure I visit there regularly! The picture of Robert, napping in the green valley is worth framing. I'm going to get a colour copy of it to remind me to relax!"
5,Rare treasure,This is iconic work from a great educator. This is a rare out-of print book. I'm glad I found it!
3,Read and Share DVD Volume 1,"In the description on the back of the DVD says that ""These 3-minute bit-size vignettes are perfect for the attention span of little ones!"" That is incredibly true. This DVD is perfect for little kids. We are going to be using this in our Sunday School class to help keep the kids attention. This is a great DVD! Thanks Thomas Nelson!"
4,DVD great for early learners - will keep their attention,"I was looking for a DVD to go along with my daughter's Beginner's Bible - and this DVD is just what I needed! There are 13 stories on the DVD - 60 minutes in length, and kept my daughter's attention. I look forward to having this in our DVD library and have her learn the stories as she grows.I could see that older children might not like the DVD as much, but for little learners - it is excellent! I plan to get the other volumes to complete our bible DVD library."
5,Great New Bible Story DVD Resources,"I highly recommend this video resource for parents and churches. If you want flying Bibles, time machines, and superheroes set in Biblical times, this is not the video for you. But if you want Bible stories that stay true to the original Biblical text in excellent animation for your preschool and elementary children, you can't find a better resource.The animation is top notch, you can use full screen and wide screen options, and it has DVD-Rom resources where you can print out coloring pictures. There's even a section with trailers, behind the scenes interviews, and other options.But even more important, the children will learn Bible stories that stay true to the Biblical accounts. In volume one, stories one through eight are from the book of Genesis, and stories nine through thirteen, come from the life of Jesus. I give this my highest recommendation."
4,"Simple, slow animation... Great for little ones!","I received the ""Read and Share DVD Bible Volume 1"" and first watched it with my 18-month-old. The DVD is made up of 13 Bible stories told in 3-minute segments. The animation is basic and moves slowly, which seemed to really help keep my toddler's attention. I thought we would just watch the first couple stories, but he was captivated for seven stories before he toddled away. The DVD incorporates lots of small animals which grabbed his attention and kept it. I know that at this point he doesn't follow the Bible stories being told, but he is hearing them and that is important.After watching the DVD I think children ages 18 months to 5 or 6 years-old would most enjoy it. That being said, our older children, ages 7, 9, and 11 all watched the DVD the entire way through and really liked it. :)We hope to add to the collection with Volumes 2 and 3 in the near future!"
5,The Three Stooges Collection,Purchased as gift for my grandson; we ordered this particular collection because of one favorite short. My grandson watched it more than once during Christmas vacation; good quality and sound.
5,"The Combo of Moe, Larry, and Shemp Might have been the BEST!!!","This volume contains some of my favorite Stooges shorts, especially: The Ghost Talks (with the voice of Phil Arnold as Peeping Tom), Malice in the Palace (with the Emir of Schmo), and Three Arabian Nuts (with the Genius of the Lamp). However, I don't agree that this is the best of the Shemp volumes. For me, that title easily goes to Volume 5, with the hilarity of Brideless Groom, Sing a Song of Six Pants, Squareheads of the Round Table, Fiddler's Three, Shivering Sherlocks, and A Crime on Their Hands. These six shorts are EASILY among the best the Stooges ever made. Curly was beloved and was a comedic genius in his own right; however, the more I watch the Shemp shorts, the more I'm thinking that the best combination of Stooges might have been Moe, Larry, and Shemp."
4,"The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 6: 1949-1951",As advertised. Fast delivery and mailed to an APO box. Great Amazon seller
3,Shemp lacked support,"As an original stooge, Shemp knew the routines but it was Curly who brought them to the general public. Budget cuts forced the Stooges to use the same material over and over and the comparison to Curly was unavoidable. Shemp was not a bad stooge, he just didn't get a chance to shine with fresh routines. In those moments of originality, he was really funny."
5,The Three Stooges Volume Six: 1949-1951,"The Three Stooges shorts continue to come out and it seems that they keep getting funnier and funnier! While it is sad that Curly is gone, Shemp makes a great replacement. Here is the episodes that are on Volume Six.Year: 1949113. The Ghost Talks114. Who Done It?115. Hokus Pokus116. Fuelin' Around117.

So, what are you waiting for Three Stooges fans? Buy now and enjoy!"
5,Hilarious!!!!,"The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 6: 1949-1951I ordered this for hubby as he loves Shemp. He's watched the entire DVD, but watches the episodes again with me & finds them just as funny as the first time he watched them!!! Whenever I'm looking for something in particular I go to Amazon & it's there! Fast shipping, great prices & keeps me posted on shipping status."
3,Shemp Mania!,"Curly Howard is sadly missed, but Moe, Larry and Shemp deliver plenty of laughs in this uneven 1949-51 collection. Needless to say, the Edward Bernds-directed shorts are preferable to Jules White's heavy-handedness. Among the best Shemps of the period: ""Fuelin' Around,"" ""Vagabond Loafers,"" ""Punchy Cowpunchers,"" ""Three Arabian Nuts"" and ""Hula-La-La"" (producer Hugh McCollum's only directorial effort). However, ""Pest Man Wins"" marks the beginning of Stock Footage Central. When Bernds and McCollum departed from Columbia in 1952, things were never the same."
1,just awful -,"just read through the 1 star reviews. Don't need to repeat it all.the idea wasn't that bad at all, but the way it has been worked out was horrible. Amazon should add zero stars or minus points. That's the category for this flick."
2,"Okay, But Could've Been Better","This movie was kind of disapointing to me. I thought it could've been a lot funnier than it was. The performance of Britnay Murphy was okay, she could've been better. The Performance of Dakota Fanning was ecxellent it was so good. She's a good child Actress. One of the best i've ever seen. The story of the movie was okay, it was slow and boring. thats why i didn't like it.Plot. Molly(Murphy) is a daughter of a dead rock star who is living of his fortune, one day her accountant runs away with the money and there is only one thing she can do, and have never done. Get A Job. This would bee a new experince for her. She becomes a nanny of a Spoild brat named Ray(Fanning) who thinks the whole world Is A Germ Infested place. There is only one thing diffrent between the two. Molly is 23 and acts like a kid, Ray is 10 and acts like an adult. Can ray show molly how to become an adult?If you liked this movie check out the soundtrack."
2,Gagtown Movie,"The problem with films like this is that the directors and writers don't trust the skills of their actors. They're calling Murphy the next Lucy but they force her into contrived situations that scream insincerity! Dakota is one of the most gifted and natural actors working today but here they spoon feed ""precocious"" lines into her that even she must have choked on for a paycheck. Watch any mature film of hers next to this one and you'll probably gag yourself.Unless you thrive on insipid fluff and happy pap, I'd stay clear of this one for sure."
2,A Bit Holey,"If nothing else this movie was cute. And that was solely due to Dakota Fanning. I think we can expect to see more from this promising young actress. Uptown Girls is a fairly decent but not creatively original story that was rushed. The main character, Molly, was highly underdeveloped, her life was confusing and lacking a certain depth and that glow that warms viewers hearts, making them feel more like a friend then an audience member. And her romance with what's-his-face-Egyptian-cotton-boy was very unrealistic and strewn about. I think this movie should have tightened itself up a bit to create a whole picture instead of a holey picture."
1,The worst movie of 2003,"I thought this movie would be cute, but it was the worst movie I ever have seen. There is no plot to the movie, and it conveys the stupidest message in the world. It leaves you stumped, and the ending relieves you as you can finally leave. All that I got from the movie was a snotty little kid, and a lazy Britney Murphy. The movie ended up with tears from the two girls, and grr, it was horrid. My parents saw this, and I cried when they brought the movie home. They were not fond of the movie, and my friend who I went to the movie theater with to see this movie hated it also. Please, don't rent this."
3,Uptown Girls,I liked this movie especially since it had a happy movie. I would recommend this movie and would buy it again
3,Just bought it as a Brittany memo.,"Just wanted it to remember Brittany by.For that it served it's purpose.May she rest in peace, she was a pretty girl."
2,Crazy Nonsense,"I thought I would have liked it but I didn't! The crazy nonsense about Egyptian Cotton, owning a pig, spinning in a teacup and the how the little girl was so unemotional. I gave this movie two stars because Dakota Fanning's acting was great. I know I said that I thought the unemotional stuff was weird but thats the script, it's not her fault."
3,Uptown Girls,"I don't know how many mature women would like this (lol) but I think it's just really cute! I just think Brittany Murphy is adorable in this movie and could only be beaten out by the adorable Dakota Fanning. No award winning performances, and just a mediocre story but it's just ""cute."" If you're not looking for much more than cute then you'll enjoy this film. I'm sure the really young girls out there will like it!"
4,Molly Smiles,"I wanted to see this movie after the previews, then I kind of forgot about it. I recently saw it and picked it up, the price was a big seller.All in all, it was a good movie.This movie seems the be the kind of role that I've come to expect from Brittany Murphy: sweet, but kind of ditzy. (See ""Just Married"")Dakota Fanning was good, but this definitely didn't compare to her performance in ""I Am Sam""; however, I thought that she did a great job in the movie.The ""Molly Smiles"" part at the end of the movie was probably it's brightest moment. Another part that I took notice of: when Molly tells Neil that he has to give because she's got nothing let to give him. Wow!It's a good movie, and it does have it's endearing moments."
4,Funny and Nice,"Maybe this is not ""The Best Movie of the Year Award"" but all movies can not be made for adults, this is a 8 to 12 year old movie. People have already talked about the substance of the movie and all its components, all I have to say is that I had a very good time watching it and I did cry. If you put yourself in the shoes of this caracters you can feel the joy and pain they live. Growing up is hard and letting go is even harder, this movie expresses exactly that; while showing love between to completely different people that are very much alike."
4,It`s good,"I liked this movie,but my dad hated it.It was hillarous.BritneyMurphy and Dakota Fanning were really funny.If u want to see a comedy see Uptown Girls."
5,Life Goes On After Your Beloved Father Dies,"First of all, I am really sorry about Brittany Murphy's death. She was one of my favourite actresses. I love that her character moves on after the death of her father. This movie shows that age isn't everything. I love that her character is acting younger than her age and Dakota Fanning's character is doing the reverse. The women were portrayed positively. I recognized the guy from Scrubs. He's an amazing actor! Like I said before, I love how Brittany's character moves on after her father's death because when you are used to living comfortably and death occurs, it can be very hard to adjust. I also love the ballet performance because it was very beautiful. I love how Dakota's character flips her hair. She is so adorable and cute! Great story, great actors, and great acting so I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
4,Uptown Girls- The Chick Flick of the Year to See,"If you were to see any chick flick this year, Uptown Girls is the one to see! It is great to see nine year old Dakota Fanning play a snotty brat to twenty-five year old Brittany Murphy, who plays her nanny. They react horridly to each other, but as the movie wears on, grow to respect and even love on another. Sure, this movie has a few down parts and more of Dakota and Brittany together should have been shown, but over all, Uptown Girls is a wonderful heartwarming movie for the whole family, ages over fourteen."
3,Sweet and irresistable,"I enjoyed this film for it's inocence and it's sweetness. The movie is very sweet, enjoyable and it's irresistable. The main reson it's good is the actors Britney Murphy is great as a ditzy young adult and Dakota Fanning is great but what movie is she not. The story it self is a little flat it drags on at times so you'll lose intrest but the charactors will make you love the film."
4,A sweet movie,"It was better than I thought it would be! Besides Dakota Fanning's horrible dance recital at the end, I feel that she did a superb acting job. Without her, I would not have enjoyed the movie nearly as much.If you like sweet, funny, feel good movies, you will probably like this one...but rent it first like I did...Blockbuster is going to hear about the scratched and filthy dvds when I return them on Monday! lol"
2,Not so good,"This movie could have been good if scenes like Murphys relationship with the ""main"" guy was more focused upon. She seemed all hurt about what happened between them but there was no relationship to be hurt about. There are a few funny and sad moments which is why the film is not completly horrible. The bottom line is that there were meaningless minutes of nonsense and not enough emphasis on important parts."
2,Not the best...yet not the worst...,"I did not like this movie. I felt it was a dry movie and was a waste of talent and time. I usually like movies with Britney Murphey but this is not one of them. The plot was short and altough you can tell there is bonding between Fanning and Murphy there is no real click in the movie. Fanning plays Ray who is spoiled and loses nannys fast, Murphey plays Molly who is rich but soon will learn she has to get a job. Together they will learn life lessons and help each other grow but it just doesn't tug at the heart strings. Not a movie I would recommend."
3,Pleasently Pleased!!,Got stuck watching this with my wife and it wasn't that bad. If your going to have to watch a chick flick this isn't a bad one to sit through.
1,Look elsewhere for entertainment,"I have no idea what movie the rest of the reviewers saw, but this movie was terrible. The story line was bland, the charters were not very realistic and the ending was way too sappy. Dakota Fanning was great in ""I Am Sam"", and she was the only reason I watched all of ""Uptown Girls"". if your smart you'll pass on this movie."
1,This isnt a fairy tale,"The movie lags on and on without going anywhere. The character are not even likable. Fannings character makes you cringe. The movie jacket says you'll cry and laugh, but you wont. The only thing you'll do is wasye 90 minutes on a really bad movie. One of the worst of 2003."
4,Sweet.,"I was interested in this movie all the way through. I watched this mostly because of Brittany Murphy, but then I was introduced to some fresh talent-Dakota Fanning. This sweet girl caught my attention with her beautiful performance here. This is a fairy tale story with a lesson to be learned. I even approve of the extras. There's a behind the scenes with the cast and I thought it was highly informative. Don't miss out on this one. My whole family liked it (ages range from 17-48), so you know that it's a pleaser for everyone."
2,you have got to be kidding,"one of the dumbest movies i have seen this year. It held no plot, and the seldom endearing moments were few and far between.If you're in the mood for a comedy, look no further than Kate and Leopold!"
2,I cannot believe someone gave them money for this,"First off hello I am your speaker for todayYou must be joking when Uptown Girls is considered funny, smart, or anything that would actually happen in lifeThan you have Britney Murphy sleeping with the little girl, Michael Jackson is on trial for something similar and these people can use money to make it a scene in a film?That and all the times Britney was half naked, she reminds me of Courtney Love, you know always messed up and on something, are they sisters?Chick flicks appeal to girls and I would expect maybe 2 a year but that all we get anymore on the larger scaleIf you've just read this and are a filmmaker or an aspiring one heed my warnings when I say if you have to make a chick flick at least make it appeal to men as well, thank you and good night"
4,Enjoyable movie!!,"I went to the theatre to see this movie and I thought it was so cute!! It's a very good movie to go see with your friends and family. A very good buy! I thought that Britney Murphy did a wonderful job of acting with Dakota Fanning in this. Dakota also did a really good job of portraying a bratty kid. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a fun loving, caring, comedy! Props to this movie!!"
4,Enjoyable Movie With A Sad Twist,"The plot of ""Uptown Girls"" revolves around a rich daughter of a dead rock star named Molly *Brittany Murphy"" who gets scanned out of her inheritance so she must get a job taking care of the bratty daughter of a record exec. The acting in thsi film is actually very good and the little girl did a great job. Brittany Murphy is amusing onscreen as she usually is. The movie is lighthearted as a whole until towards the end when the predictable ending doesn't come into play and tragedy is introduced instead. Very sad. Still, a very good movie."
3,Cute!,"This movie is definitely one for a girls' night out. It is sweet and moving, but not annoyingly so. Murphy and Fanning both play spoiled rich girls in need of love and attention. When Murphy learns that her inheritance has been wasted away, she must get a job. She fails at the first thing she tries and ends up working as the nanny for Fanning.Murphy's character is a bit too weird and eccentric to be sympathetic, but every once in awhile you feel for her. Fanning, meanwhile, is absolutely dazzling as the lonely little girl who takes everything in life too seriously. You may shed a few tears in this movie, but you'll leave feeling the tears were worth it. All in all, a very good movie."
3,Achingly Sweet Movie,This is a tear-jerker of a movie! While there are some surprising sweet moments in this movie.Overall though the plot is very thin. I liked Brittany Murphy but she was better in Just Married. Dakota Fanning was the save in this movie. For that reason I will recommened this movie.
2,over priced lacking in quality,"I also feel that this toy is over priced. I bought this for my 6 yr. old daughter for Christmas and was totally disappointed in the quality of the materials used to make this. I was lucky and got it at a VERY good sale price, but even so I feel I paid way too much money. She did play with it for a couple of days but now she hardly even looks at it. My 2-1/2 yr. daughter is also bored with it. They do like it but it just doesn't have the thrill to it that we thought it would."
3,A Pricey Suprise,I must start by saying that I paid $50.00 at Linens-n-Things for the castle by price matching and a coupon so I did not pay full price for this toy (a good thing at that). My 3 yr old daughter wanted this soooo very badly for her birthday so of course the little princess got her princess castle. While I was impressed with the beautiful detail of the castle itself I was suprised with the size. The castle itself appears to be a good size but the inside is small and really there is no room to play with the dolls. My daughter has had it for 3 days and really has not played all that much with it. Santa is bringing her the loving family twin dollhouse for x-mas and that I think she will enjoy more since there is all the accesories that you can put inside the house and can actually play inside the house with the dolls P.S. THe carraige that you can buy seperatly (which she also got) the horse does not stand up by itself!
3,Too small,I think this toy is overpriced because it is too small. It should be like $40.00. That is all.
2,Really flimsy castle!!!,This castle is very overpriced and very flimsy. I am glad this was a Christmas present and I am not out the money for this thing. We are giving her a three story large dollhouse for Christmas this year so that we can throw this piece of junk away!!!!
4,I Not that great,I didn't like this movie it was not what I was expecting and it should never even have been made. I only gave a good rating because I don't feel it a necessity to ruin this sellers rating.
5,This rocks,"This is a great tool, so much better than my snap-on wrenches for this work. The size is perfect for the added leverage you need."
4,Amrican Shaolin,"Held my interest! A lot about China and tradition mixed in with understanding, humor, and some relaly good stories."
5,"A funny, fresh memoir on an unlikely topic","I came across this book initially in the desperate hunt for something - ANYTHING - my reading-adverse high school aged son would enjoy. He did enjoy it, and so did I - and I have less than no interest in martial arts. The author's funny, Innocent Abroad persona is appealing, as are the insights he provides into the previously unexplored world of martial arts as they're practiced in China. The personalities jump off the page, and his lively sense of the ridiculous in his descriptions of his encounters and culture clashes in his dogged pursuit of expertise in some of the amazingly challenging and frankly weird practices of the shaolin monks are charmingly self-deprecating and laugh-out-loud funny. A PERFECT book for nearly anyone, particularly that book-indifferent young man on your list."
5,"A special book - warm, funny and thoroughly enjoyable","This book will appeal to anyone who likes a good story and a good laugh. On the surface, the book seemingly appeals more naturally to men, but it is great book for anyone who welcomes adventure, likes rooting for the underdog, and loves great writing ala PJ O'Rourke and Christopher Buckley. Matt Polly is a great new writer -- I'm hooked."
4,"China, Buddhism, Martial Arts, What a story","Well written story of a young American living his dream. A confused college student gets bored with Princeton (how that can be only he knows) and decides to just pick up and go to China. When he gets off the plane he acutally has to ask the Chinese people if they know where the Shaolin Temple is. Who in their right mind would have the guts at 19 years old to do that? What a delightful story of an event filled adventure into the heart of China. Everyone has a dream, but very few actually take this level of risk and live it. Great story."
2,American Shaolin,"I was somewhat disappointed with the book. In particular, I did not find the author/protagonist to be very likeable. I did not need him to push his politics on me -- I can think for myself. The only part of him that I admired at all was his willingness to go off on a big adventure, albeit it on daddy's dollar."
3,"Six of one, half-dozen of the other","As a travel narrative, the book is excellent. It's easy to learn a lot about the Chinese culture from this period of time, and the local characters are likable, well-written, and complex. If read as a memoir, however, it's difficult for me to get over the fact that the author just isn't very likable. He begins as a self-centered college student, and never really evolves all that much. Sure, he gets stronger and more skilled at his art, but I was never able to sympathize with him. No matter why this is the case, the book is mildly recommended if read for what it is--a light travelogue for those interested in China or martial arts. Those looking for an example to follow or a character for which to root ought look elsewhere."
4,Inspirational. Worth reading.,"I enjoyed the book. It is definitely not a literature art of work, but easy entertaining reading with some useful facts. The story gets little bit dull and author definitely little bit too self centered, but I am putting four stars just because I have a huge respect for author and his experience. As a young man with a lot of insecurities, instead of hang out at bars and desperately try to be ""cool"", he followed his dream and establish himself as an individual with strong character. The author is understandably proud of himself and I praise him for what he did. For me, this book was an inspiration, then education about China and martial arts."
4,"I'm No 'Karate Kid""!","I'm a 65 year old woman and still loved this book because I LEARNED some things about a subject that originally didn't even interest me. Great insights into a geographical neighbor and economic competitor we all need to inform ourselves about. This book does it in an entertaining way, and is cool enough to send to young relatives and have them think you are awesome."
3,Too long detail....,"I read this book because the background set in Venice and the romanic feel of it. But I can't even finish it and don't know if I can. I try to keep myself reading it, but the story is broken into different timeline and jump to one place/topic to another, it's not like an on going story that keep reader want to flip the next page and find out what happen next. I lost interest by the long detail of everything and of the detail that not really matter to the topic then I totally lost what it was about...I have to say, Lovric did a great job to bring Venice to reader's mind, you can actually see the image of places and life. But the long detail and the timeline really lost reader's interest that made this book more like a reference then a novel..."
3,Ridiculous,"This is a too-long book with a ludicrous premise: a 13-year old girl, Cecilia, has an affair with the 57-year-old Cassanova in Venice at the end of the 18th century. Her fairly wealthy, merchant parents are completely in the dark, as are the nuns at her school, even though she spends all night having sex in gondolas. Cecilia wants to be an artist, so Casanova buys her some paints and with hardly any training she establishes herself as a portrait painter.Many years later, she is a famous female portrait artist (apparently a prodigy) falls madly in love with Lord Byron, whose sexual appetites and bizarre behaviors are catalogued in far too much detail. I would never have read this (skimmed the last 100 pages) if it hadn't been among the books lent by a friend for a vacation in Mexico, and I finished all my other options!The descriptive narrative about Venice was interesting, but wordy."
3,Sometimes A Memory,"With the Nintendo Gamecube fading into obscurity, many gamers are flocking to buy the Wii in droves. Although that is unfortunate for those looking for great games, they can always still find great accessories for the system. This memory card handles well, carrying 128MB of memory, which can hold over 60 different games in memory, which works well for those who want to hold sports titles like Madden '07 and '06, or great classic titles like Super Mario Sunshine, and The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess (Gamecube edition). Although it isn't bad, it just doesn't work as well as the one Nintendo made. My Gamecube sometimes doesn't recognize this memory card. I really suggest you get one that Nintendo made instead.Price: B-Convience: C+Overall: C+"
5,Gamecube128MB Memory Card,This memory card is way better than the factory-branded cards you get from Nintendo and at a better price!!!
4,Pretty decent,"Great capacity for the price. Not a bad deal if you can manage to get free shipping. However, saving seems a bit sluggish as opposed to a 64MB card I have from a different vendor, so it gets 4 stars."
4,Sis likes it.,I dont know how to rate a poster. If you see my other reviews you'll see I rate PS2 games. My sister likes it when she saw the Giants win even though we like the Pats. She thought he was cute like about 20 other people over 19 when she's 14. It;s a good gift and it'll make people happy.PS- Check out my profile and see what I got... it's awesome!!!!!!!!!!
4,LOVE this book!,I try to read an etiquette book each year. This book is great! It has the basics. Its a pretty fun read too! :)
4,Needed,"I really liked this book, out of all the other ones I researched this one covered a lot that is needed for many women. I took what I didn't already know, and still liked the way she worded everything else.I say a much needed book for women in all aspects; covers an array of information."
2,"deadly boring, but useful","I've got some delicate negotiations coming up at work, so I wanted very much to read this book. It contains useful techniques, but it's a terrible read. It's boring, verbose, and repetitive. Its style sounds as if it were written in the 1950's; formal and stilted. I had to force myself to finish it.My guess is that the book is such a bad read because Fisher and Shapiro wanted to put their techniques into a theoretical framework. (At the end of the book they cite a huge amount of theoretical literature.)One aspect I had to laugh at is that they didn't cite Herbert Cohen! Cohen's first book, You can Negotiate Anything, is much more useful and much more entertaining than this one. In fact, I'm not sure that Fisher and Shapiro said anything that Cohen didn't say more simply."
5,Beyond Reason: Using Emotions as You Negotiate,"This is a great book for helping individuals, families, businesses, and governments maintain relationships and resolve differences. There are real examples of how the concepts have worked in situations as difficult as international conflicts. If this book was widely used as a guide in conflict resolution, there would be hope for world peace!"
4,Another Strong Work,"""Getting to Yes"" deservedly became a classic in its field. This book, co-authored by Roger Fisher, is another strong addition to the literature in this area.I did not like the audio edition's use of both music (very trite) and of ""guest narrators."" These devices were especially irritating when you learn that the audio edition is an abridgement. By inference, it suggests that core material was edited out in order to make room for bad music and guest narrators.But maybe that's just me being emotional..."
2,Moral of the story: negotiate by being nice to the enemy,"This wasn't good. The reason it gets 2 stars was because of the depth of the material. So much packed into 5 discs. I listen while I work in the office, as I don't have time to sit and read a book. I suffered through all of it but got little out of it. Yet more negotiation stuff that unlike Herb Cohen, who offers practical advice, tells you how to kiss up to the other side and make them happy and ""hey can't we all be friends."" That stuff doesn't work in the area of law, my field. There's no bargaining here, just long boring talks about how to reserve the right conference room and pamper everyone. Lots of long drawn-out examples of this too. Roger Fisher, I believe, wrote the book ""Getting to Yes"" and/or ""Getting Past No"", at least one of those. Those were great books. This is not."
2,You better stick to Getting to Yes... this does not add anything new!,"I was very excited when I bought this book. After learning so many thing with Roger Fisher in ""Getting to Yes"", I really thought this book was going to help me become a better negotiator... Nevertheless, it is pretty much the same that Getting to Yes. It adds more examples about emotional negotiations as par example with your teenage kids or a hurt customer, but nothing that you can not infer from your own experience. It repeats a lot the same concepts (that is why you will see reviews saying that it is a boring book) and in general, I was expecting much more of this book than what I got. This is not a keeper. It is one of those books that were made to be read just once. You better get ""Getting to Yes"" (by Roger Fisher and William Ury), ""Negotiate to Close"" (by Gary Karrass), and ""Difficult Conversations - How to Discuss What Matters Most"" (by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen.) Those are real keepers!!!"
2,Worth a quick reading,"I read this book right after reading ""Starting with NO"" by Jim Camp. My key takeaway is the awareness about the core concerns that stimulate emotions during negotiation - Appreciation, Autonomy, Affiliation, Status & Role.It was hard for me to sustain interest with the book. I felt that there is more theory than real life stories & examples. Anyways, it is worth a quick reading."
1,"Very, very basic.","I began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating. As a lawyer handling divorce and family cases, I frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and I was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations. However, this book was incredibly basic, and I'm not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious. There are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique."
5,"a ""bible"" for applicants","I highly recommend students AND parents read this latest edition of Sarah McGinty's book. The student will discover suggestions, examples and techniques to write an essay worthy of a top tier student. As a bonus, the clear, concise writing styles put forth in this book could help anyone create a proposal or presentation."
5,Definitely worthwhile.,"As a high school teacher and guidance counselor, I recommend this easy-to-read and easy-to-understand instruction book to all students. McGinty is knowledgable, relevant and forthright. In my particular educational situation, I find that students find the basic instruction and information from Chapters 3, 4, and 5 most helpful. A number of students that I come in contact with believe that their basic fifth grade writing lesson on the five-paragraph essays is sufficient for all situations. I've downloaded the new version for my Kindle. I found that with the previous paper edition my book would periodically be misplaced...for weeks at a time :). I encourage all students to purchase their own version, as this is a tremendous reference to have around."
1,Awful,I can say that it is a singular waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy a book of successful essays instead
2,Not so fun,"I did not buy this miniatures and a Braxar's War booster pack to play Dreamblade but to play D&D. Well, this collection do not have many fun miniatures. Most are just... strange. If you want to buy dreamblade to play d&d, buy just the basic sets."
4,Review from The Geological Journal,"""Anyone in the business of teaching evolution will find it a useful resource, especially for its extensive referencing..."""
3,Two idiots on tour,"The book is very well detailed when it come to talking about tournament golf and settiing up the hole to give you a clear understanding. But when it comes the behind the ropes stuff, it wasnt that great. Good but not great. All they really tell you is about the personal problems with women and getting drunk. If your a serious golfer. This book will make you shake your head on how these two are blowing it all away."
3,Not your run of the mill golf book,"I enjoyed the book. I think it gives the reader a look behind the curtain of PGA tour golf that you would not get from a seasoned player or writer. I only heard of the book when it was reported the Steve Duplantis was struck and killed by a car while a PGA event was held in San Diego. The news article said Duplantis, made famous by the book Bud, Sweat and Tees and lead me to look it up. As a golfer reading the book you can't help but have some feelings about talent wasted, and many poor decisions, and it seem Rich's father is especially bitter. But, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it but only for people that already know a good deal about the tour and want to look at what it's like a a rookie."
1,A waste of money .....................,"I found this book to be a waste of money and if I were either of the main characters....I would be totally embarrassed to have my immaturities listed for several hundred pages. We've all been young - and I certainly would not want my earlier days in print...I can't believe the characters let themselves be exposed like this - even if it is all true. If you want to read about a couple young men running around to bars, strip clubs, and watch one of them dump their kid off to any new girlfriend he can find -then by all means this is your book. If you were looking for some real insight into the typical tour pro, their caddie, their challenges, wins and defeats - then look somewhere else......"
2,error filled,"I was one of the people interviewed for this book and am quoted several times throughout. It's a slip shod effort by Shipnuck that is filled with factual errors, misspelled words and names and typos. The author is desparately trying to be funny and along the way he stretches the truth. Beem's win at the 1999 Kemper Open and how he got there is a great story. Unfortunately, Shipnuck shouldn't have been the one to tell it."
1,"""Writer trying to cash in!""",This book is a terrible example of someone thinking what they have written is interesting! What a waist of my money!
2,"SOMEONE, PLEASE WAKE ME UP","To put it mildly, this book failed to live up to my expectations. I really was hoping to gain some insight on the PGA Tour, not a story about two lost souls who are trying to find themselves. I don't even understand the title. Where is the Blood (obviously neither wants success bad enough), Sweat (the guy rarely practiced, unless you count lifting a beer can) and Tees (that's exactly what I was: T-E-A-S-E-D)."
2,No Dogen,"Despite having great interest in the subject, this book did not make much sense to me. Perhaps it was writing, perhaps the translation; just when one hoped for at least some anecdote to make sense, it got into some poetic pseudo-strain and so this reader was completely at sea. It surely was nothing comparable to Dogen Zenji."
5,great for listening or dance,I've had this album for a number of years and still love it. As a dancer and teacher I'm always listening to and purchasing new CDs in middle eastern and mediterranean genres. This has been one of my favorites. I have a routine for my classes for Sallam Allay and even as novice listeners they are drawn to this music. This album is light enough for the new listener and true enough for the hard core fans. It is by far my favorite with Hossam Ramzy!
4,"Before you buy this, read the reviews for ""The Atco Sessions 1969-1972""","For years I'd been waiting for ""New Routes"" to come out on CD. Had it come out before ""The Atco Sessions,"" I'd have gladly purchased it and been content. But please read the reviews of Lulu's creative output during this four year period of her career--you may want to spend the extra $$ on ""The Atco Sessions."" You'll get all of ""New Routes,"" and you'll be investing in a real keeper."
2,Disappointed,"I saw the trailer way before the movie came out and was psyched to watch it. I even took a train to NYC in hopes of watching it, but the theatre stopping showing it a day prior. Finally I ordered it from Amazon and watched it with my girlfriend who also was anticipating watching it. We were both hugely disappointed. The previews made the movie look so intense but I thought the movie was weak. The soundtrack was one song played over and over. Their was no great revenge scene, the acting was almost amateur. Ugh, just horrible."
2,An amateur film which shows the filmmaker's inexperience,"This is a film from a young film school student. It's about a group of half-brothers in Arkansas who hate each other and the violence that erupts between them. It's supposed to show the personalities of a certain type of low-class southern men who work in dead-end jobs, drink a lot and do not show much outward emotion.This is an amateur film all the way and shows the filmmaker's inexperience. The acting wasn't bad, but the pacing and editing were horrible. This was supposed to be a serious drama but I frankly couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud at times.Perhaps this filmmaker will get better as time goes by but I just didn't see his talent in this film."
1,garbage,"Light flimsy steel, cheaply made in China, no leg supports so they wiggle and bend, temp controls are pre set so you don't have fine control. They might be a little cheaper but you definitely get what you pay for."
2,Great grill for a mechanic.,"Bought Texas Grill last Aug. Love the food. Been broken 5 times. Including National Chaampionship day, Easter and Today, Mothers day. Trager's response...you still have plenty of warranty left. Thanks. I didn't know I'd have to be a mechanic to own a Traeger, sure glad they moved production to China.Update- I bought it in Aug of 2011 for 800 dollars. As a business owner I could never tell my customers, don't worry about the quality, just call me when ever you need my item to work, I'll have new parts to you in a few days. SO TODAY I GAVE IT AWAY, zero dollars, haul it away, ba bye. Traeger you can insult and disrespect someone else. I will do everything I can to discourage people from buying a Traeger. I have read the reviews and have found I am not the only one with these problems. The Traeger family have made their millions and I'm sure they don't give a crap, but if it is possible to keep one person from buying this grill, I will rejoyce in my accomplishment."
2,not working out of box,"my new $600+ grill needed a new controler right out of the box. The company was very friendly and quickly sent me a new controler but now I have to find and pay some one to instal it. Traeger would benifit from quality control before sending grills out for sale.Updaate:again the grill quit working mid smokeing a rost, keep pumping in pellets with out lighting them. Traeger offed to send me more parts so i could pay someone to change their shoty parts again. Only had it 6 weeks took it back to Costco today"
1,Really?,"Wow, I can deal with pulp fiction, sensationalism, formulaic plots etc but I cannot handle ""don't care enough to make it interesting"" This was drivel. I hope that some spineless corporate lawyer at EA sucked all the life out of this book and that ML wanted to write a better book but was sabotaged."
3,Not too bad,"The story is not too bad and it is quite enjoyable, but it is not grand and too simple and predictable"
1,a few thoughts,"The novel, if it can be called that, was clearly designed for the younger reader, at least as far as the plot and word choice go. The actual meat of the story strikes me as somewhat less appropriate for younger readers, but in a day and age where the average 3 year old has seen sex on T.V. several times and witnessed hundreds of murders as well, there probably isn't much that the average 14-year old hasn't seen already that's in the book.I should note that there is, of course, nothing graphic, with regard to violence or otherwise, in the book. The characters are painted well to appeal to a younger teenage audience, particularly the main character who, while being transparent in his entirety, fits well in a book designed for younger readers.As the first book I've read by this author, Castle of the Deception was a complete disappointment, and it will be some time before I consider looking at another of her works."
2,Not a particularly useful text,"If you are unfamiliar with the field of OMVPE this text would serve as a good introduction. It does indeed cover the fundamentals of the OMVPE process. However, that is about all it covers. For those in industry or academia who are already acquainted with OMVPE, this book adds very little to your knowledge or understanding. The theoretical and mathematical treatment of the various issues listed is practically nonexistent. The sections that actually contain formulae are few and far between. Again, this is great if you are just starting to learn; this is rather disappointing if you are looking for an in-depth treatment of OMVPE. The one saving grace is that there are extensive lists of references that you can track down to find the details that are left out of the book itself. That's a lot of money for just a reference list though."
2,Buy This Book If You're Using Someone Else's Money!!,"This has come to be used as a text or reference in the field of compound semiconductor epitaxy only because of the absence of anything better! This is a cursory introduction to a very broad field by a man whose own experiences have little relevance or bearing on the state of the art. A fair attempt is made at covering the basics of the subject and a good number of relevant publications are cited. Unfortunately the book has all the charm and utility of the author which cannot be quantatively evaluated without the use of negative numbers! I have found a good use for this book in my laboratory though, as one of my workbenches had a short leg under which this fit nicely!"
5,the best,I've had this CD for three years and I still haven't tired of it. It has some of the tightest disco jams I've ever heard and haven't found on any other CD. I've been listening to disco for 10 years and this CD is by far the best. Definitely very good underground!
2,"Loved it on day #1, but things started to sour","PROS : decent range, intercom feature (my wife and i use that all the time), room monitor feature, sound quality.CONS : (1) you can change ringers for different callers, but you can't change the ringer the intercom, and the default ringer is a shrill, annoying, piercing sound; (2) you can scroll through a list of past incoming calls (by caller ID), but long distance numbers don't come with a ""1"" so when you press the green ""flash"" button, it dials the number w/o the ""1"" and obviously encounters a phone network error - instead, you have manually input the entire number; (3) our accessory handset started giving choppy sound quality (and intermittently, no sound quality upon answering calls) after 10 months, and upon following the user manual instructions to de- an re-register it, it doesn't work at all. we're sending it back to uniden to invoke our 1-year warranty."
3,Good Phone - for a year anyway.....,"I would have given this phone 5 stars before last week. My mother and I both purchased this phone in Oct 2006. Hers immediately went blank. You couldn't see anything on the screen period. I thought it was just a fluke and they replaced her phone and everyone was happy. Well 30 days after the return period hers died again. I liked mine so much I just bought her another one to replace that one. WELL, last week my screen died as well. You can no longer use the address book, caller id, or anything. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this phone!"
1,Short calls are your only option with this phone!,"These phones are bad. I purchased two in March 2007 and have had nothing but problems since. They hang up on ANY phone call after 2-3 minutes. I have them on the chargers 24/7, and still they hang up. If I walk more than 5 feet away from the base unit, they also hang up with a message saying ""Out of Range"". What is the range on these things...4 feet?I'm currently trying to find out where to send them back to Uniden for a refund."
1,Phone does not work well,"The phone was not audible. If you received or placed a call, there is interference on the line (a buzzing sound). Whether I was near the base or away from the base, the audio was horrible. I returned it and bought a GE phone which is great!!!"
1,BUZZ makes 2-line feature completely unusable,"This phone has some really fantastic features. As a 1 line phone I highly recommend it. If you add the 2nd line, you CANNOT use both lines. As soon as the 2nd call comes in, the 1st call line is filled with loud buzz and the caller is inaudible."
3,DON'T BUY THIS AS PART OF A MULTI-PHONE SET,"This was listed along with the Uniden TRU9485-3 apparently as an expansion set. This is a free-standing, functional system. (To be completely fair, Amazon was fantastic about taking it back.) The phone system itself is fine. The distance is only fair, but the quality within the house is good and the handset is comfortable to use. The readout is easy to see and the menus are intuitive. Again - the only real gripe is range."
4,Pretty satisfied,"This is a good product at a good price. My only complaint is a relatively small one. It doesn't have the long range that I've had with other cordless phones.It looks sharp, the sound quality is good and it's very convenient to have more than one handset."
2,Does NOT work with Uniden TRU-9466,"I had to return this item because it's not compatible as an additional handset for the Uniden TRU9466 phone system.When I purchased the Uniden TRU9466 unit, the TRU9460 came up as a ""buy this unit also"" choice, implying that it worked with the TRU9466. Once it arrived, I found out that the TRU9460 was a standalone unit and would NOT associate with the Uniden TRU9466 2-line system.The good news is that Amazon refunded my money, including shipping. I was pleased with that, even though frustrated by the inconvenience of not having an additional handset."
3,"Good phone, terrible instructions","I already owned Uniden's 2 phone expandable phone system and wanted an additional extension. While this phone works, it really isn't the right phone for this purpose, but I had to call Uniden after I bought the phone to figure that out. I couldn't match the instructions to the phone; the phone just would not do what the manual said it should do. Tech support admitted that the method to register the phone to the base was different than what was printed in the manual, and that there is another phone that would have suited my needs better. Oh well, in the end it works and the range is pretty good, perhaps 150' and the clarity is excellent for a cordless phone."
1,uniden phone,I got this phone to go with our other uniden so that we had a phone in each room. It wont work with our other unidens. So was a waste of my money and time.
2,poor sound quality,The people I spoke to using this phone either didn't recognize my voice or said I sounded like I was talking down a drain pipe. Also I found the ringer not loud enough.
3,Quality is fine - perhaps a bit dull,This is a fine Halloween costume. My daughter liked it well enough and it's not as cheap quality as many costumes I've seen or owned. Fit seemed about right for the size.
5,Excellent book on plains indian live!,"One of the most complete books I have read about the every day life of the Plains Indians. It share every aspect of the day to day life and how religion, art and cuture intertwine to make up the social strucure of a complece and sucsesful society."
2,Not so good,"My old Panasonic Shaver served me well for years, but this New Ultra Dry has not worked near as well. The batteries do not last too long and the shave is not good on my medium thick beard."
1,Poor Cutting!,Age 63 WASP beard won't be cut by this razor. Hairs growing on your neck under your chin won't be trimmed. Very spotty cutting on cheeks. We returned this razor for a full credit from Amazon.
5,I like it..,"I got this for vacation traveling. It packs very small, runs on AAA batteries and just works like a champ. I am very happy with the purchase as it does everything that I want. It shaves close and does it fast."
3,The Cult of Cartman-Revelations,Nothing was damaged and came on time. As far as the DVD if course it was great but you can have the same with season series. How ever you wish to do it.
4,South Park: The Cult of Cartman,A must have for the south park fan Very well packaged in what looks like a bible. All of the best Cartman episodes
4,Why is this only avaliable in fullscreen ?,Great Series no problems with the dvd or its content.Only that its in fullscreen which is kinda annoying while watching on a Widescreen TV.
2,just S.P.,I really thought it would be more...I like south Park but for this I could of just got the show on DVD and had the same thing...It's sad caues i wanted to like this more..Buy the hold Season on DVD you get a better show...Respcet my Auth.
1,not received,I never got this item bec for some reason unknown the sale was cancelled by the other party.
1,You Can Have Mine!,"I bought this to use in baking. As a low-carber of many years, I have learned to use several dry ingredients together to take the place of plain flour. Even though I only use this as part of the dry ingredient mix, the soy taste is still prevalent in the end result. I now add just a tablespoon or so to my baked goods just so that I can use it up, but I will never buy it again. Everything else I have used from Bob's Red Mill has been very good, so I had higher hopes for this product."
1,NOT good for low-carbers!,"If you are actually a low-carber, you probably want to avoid this product. Read the ingredients list.... it just is not low-carb. All the reviews that say that they like the taste are not for you. If taste was the only criteria that matters, that would be different. But low-carbers make choices first based on whether the food fits their way of eating and only second on how it tastes.If you are just avoiding ""whites"" because of diabetes or other health concerns, this may work for you and is a definite improvement over Bisquick."
5,Great product; great nutrition,"Bob's Red Mill products are all good but this one is really special. Zone dieters (and low carb dieters in general) really struggle to add old favorites to their menu ... especially baked goods. Bob's Red Mill baking mix is very much like Bisquick, but without the poor nutritional stats that Bisquick brings with it. Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix enables us to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, etc., etc. that are ""Zone friendly"" so we can stay ""in the zone"" and still eat many of the things we were missing while on the Zone program (which, if you haven't tried and want to improve your nutrition or lose weight, you really should!). Thank you Bob's Red Mill for another great product!"
4,Good enough,"Does this mix make adequate pancakes? yes. Does it make great pancakes? No. So I give it a ""good enough"" rating."
5,Excellent product!,"I have been on the Atkins diet for the past month and a half (with great results!) But, I am not too crazy about the taste of the Atkins low carb baking mix. I decided to give this one a try, and I am so glad I did! I have read thru some of the other reviews, and for the most part, it was given high marks. I'd like to add to that five star rating by saying how much easier it is to use. No clumping, no harsh after taste, and I love the whole grain flavor! The pancakes are awesome, and its good to be able to have them again! You feel satisfied on a very small amount of anything made with this product, and remain comfortably full, which helps you avoid 'picking' in between meals. Highly recommend!"
5,"hard to find, low carb",Very good of this kind and makes excellent muffins.( try this with the famous Muffin Magic muffin maker.)Good flour and low carb..
4,Best!,"I had tried multiple coats for my miniature, short-haired dachshund until we purchased this shearling coat-reasonably priced & well-fitting...not too heavy, just the right weight & body length for my dachshund...very happy to finally find a good fit at a good price!"
1,Not as nice looking/ quality as I'd hope,"I went by the reviews and I guess missed something along the way..I bought this for my 11 lb Chihweenee, who is about 13"" long...way way way to small in length and in girth...Velcro was pretty cheap as well...Red is not the beautiful deep red as the picture shows, not even the strawberry red as ""they"" had described it..more like a very faded red.... Not a good purchase...oh and it took forever to ship /receive it.."
1,Suede Shearling Coat,"I loved the coat itself. Was pretty and warm, however, the velcro used to fasten it was very poor quality. I had to send the coat back for a refund."
5,great coat,This was not big enough for my dog but I loved the coat. I wish this was available in my dog's size.
3,Wish the sizing chart was right!,"The coat is very cute but unfortunately I have to return it. I measured my dog and ordered according to the sizing chart. When I put it on my dog it was huge! So I looked at the tag on the coat, the sizing chart on the tag is very different than the one in Amazon's description. I am very disappointed. What a hassle!"
2,not for a high energy dog,"i have a sighthound, when it gets cold i want at least part of him covered so he will be warm when he does his business and during our walks. as a puppy at full speed he ripped the strap off completely just playing in the yard there are no arm holes this is a ""cape"" design with a single velcro strap made with the same material as the coat and was easily ripped apart by a 12 week old pup."
4,Best coat ever!,"I saw this on a neighbor's dog and thot I'd give it a try. What I love most is how easy it is to get on my wee yorkies. No arm or head openings. Just lay it on their back and secure the neck and belly straps. No more fighting with them to get a coat on. Easy peasy. It's adorable, warm and durable. As I said, best coat ever!"
4,Nice looking and seems warm,"Nice product in terms of looks and warm and weight. I did not give it 5 stars because the straps are way too long for the coat size--I had to have them shortened by 2"" on each side."
4,Keeps my puggle warm!,"I wanted a coat that was easy to put on my puggle (so my husband wouldn't whine about what a pain it is to put a coat on the dog when they go for walks). My puggle is a little on the husky side (between 25-30 pounds) and most ""mediums"" are just a little too small. I bought the large which is just a little too big, but it does the trick. She hates the coat, but I think it does a good job keeping her warm and dry on her winter walks."
4,Suede Shearling Coat Sizing Issues,"I loved the coat - especially since I have the same wire haired fox terrier as in the picture. Unfortunately, sizing info was not supplied and I had to search elsewhere. Ultimately, the coat was too short in length so I had to return it"
4,Suede Doggie Coat,This coat is very nice. Very warm. The sizing is the only thing that bothered me. I have bought this size for Trixie before; but this is a little big.
1,Suede Shearling Cost for a Dog,"Sizes were crazy as I tried two different shipments to get a correct size and neither were successful - therefore, no good"
1,Fail,"Never even received this item, wasted my money -_- I also called the company who shipped and they said they were going to call me back with a case number and nothing. Upsetting, wanted this for my pupp."
4,"Good coat, but the color is duller than the picture.","I bought the medium pink one for my 20 lbs rat terrier-beagle mix dog. The fit is okay, it is actually a little bigger, but it works. The color is a lot duller than the picture, but it is still pink. It is very easy to put on, and my dog does not hate it. This is her first winter coat, so overall a good purchase."
3,cute but too big for my boxer,I bought this for my boxer. He's 8 years old and in great shape. The length is good but I have to shorten it around the body because it's made for a fat dog. It's also thinner than I expected.
1,Not my cup of tea.,"I bought this book online from Amazon because there were very few recipes included with the pressure cooker I purchased. I was excited when the book arrived via Amazon, but after paging through the entire cookbook, I can safely say there is nothing in it that I want to make. I am not into going out and buying expensive, obscure ingredients. If YOU are into that, this is probably a cookbook you would enjoy. I just wanted a how-to pressure cookbook with basic GOOD food."
1,pressure perfect,bought this book thinking it had a lot of recipes. i was wrong i wish that i had not bought this book. it was such a disapointment. the review on line i thought was very misleading. the best thing i can say about this book is the cover.
1,Pressure perfect,"The author of this cook book is obviously not a writer and has no knowledge of how to write a cook book. This is the worst piece of garbage I have ever tried to read. She writes is as if it were a novel. Such as some of the childrens books I read to my grand kids. Also, it would appear that most of the book is only copies she has taken out of other cook books and has not done a very good job of it. I would like to send this back to amazon for a refund!!!!!"
4,Cooking under pressure,The book is written so that anyone can understand it and has lots of helpful hints.
5,Great pressure cooker cookbook!,"Very nice book, loads of good recipes. Pressure cooking is a great time saver and everything comes out tender and cooked just right."
4,Excellent introduction to the pressure cooker,"Having acquired a pressure cooker with no idea how to use it, I found this book a great introduction to pressure cooker technique, as well as the broad range of recipes that can be made in this way. So far, everything I've tried has been very good-- I had no idea that you could pressure cook a pot of pasta in just a few minutes with only a small amount of liquid. But her pasta with butternut squash and ricotta was very tasty and not at all mushy as I'd feared. I appreciate that after each recipe she lists several variations, including vegetarian versions where possible. I find that many of her recipes require some seasoning adjustments as they can tend slightly on the bland side. But as a book on basic technique, it's indispensable."
3,"OK, but I've got a better one","I have cooked with pressure for 15 years. If you need the basics this book is OK but the recipes I've made aren't all that good--I have yet to find one that I want to make again. If you are looking for tasty recipes, I highly, highly recommend ""Pressure Cooking for Everyone"" by Rodgers, et al. It has recipes that I make over and over, and still has enough basic instruction for the novice."
5,What a cook needs to learn to use a pressure cooker,"When I received my new pressure cooker, the small cookbook included was uninspiring to this cooking enthisiast. Then I found Pressure Perfect. Perhaps not for a novice cook, Lorna Sass's approach to her recipes to full of information and inspriation. By offering variations and transformations, it is easy to see how you can create your own dishes. Yes the includes all the information on timing and use of your pressure cooker that you need to feel confident with this new tool. I'm looking into her other books!"
3,Dated,"I surveyed the pressure cooker (PC) books for one that would provide definitive PC vocabulary, techniques, usage and maybe some useful tables. Sass provides that better than the others I looked at. Still, if you want to liven up PC cooking you need to refer to more recent sources, especially Modernist. Cooking with the PC today involves the Pot-in-Pot Method wherein an open heat-proof pot or bowl is filled with seasoned product and placed inside the PC to be cooked. Canning jars, semi-closed, are now used to create confits and other complex mixtures when cooked under pressure for hours. The PC has also been rediscovered as a great tool for making stock in a hurry.Nathan Myhrvold's Modernist Cuisine at Home is the current best source for new PC cookery. For the less adventurist, Pressure Cooking and The Pressure Cooker Gourmet by FastCooking.ca look promising."
2,Not updated for auto-pressure cookers,"I bought this book along with a modern electric auto-pressure cooker. The book had 20 pages about general pressure cooking in the front and 20 pages of charts in the back. The rest of the book was receipts which all assumed you were using grandma's cooker requiring you to adjust the time, pressure, pressure up, pressure down, cool down, and constant attention. I bought the electric cooker because it did all the programming for me automatically. I just need a book to teach me when to use a pressure cooker instead of another method and what learning I need to make the changes in methods. I returned this book for another focusing on ""when to use a pressure cooker instead of another method"", focusing on differences between pressure and non-pressure cooking."
2,Not much to learn from the book,The recipes in the book are very simple ones. They are no more useful than those in the book came with my pressure cooker.
3,Easy & Healthy Recipes but Mediocre Taste,"This cookbook is a good asset for those new to pressure cooking. Sass provides the reader with information on how pressure cookers work, how to buy a pressure cooker, and how to use and maintain a pressure cooker. She also provides helpful tables on the cook times for meat and beans. The recipes in this book are fairly healthy and easy to follow, however, I found the taste to be mediocre. There is not recipe that I have tried that I would make again."
5,A must have,Very good and useful book. I found important tips about how to use the pressure cooker and deliciouse recipes too. Before having this book I was a little afraid of using the pressure cooker..now it is the cooker I use the most!!!I strongly recomend this book!Federica
3,Mediocre,"I purchased the Cuisinart Electric Pressure Cooker at Williams Sonoma. I also bought two cookbooks, this one by Sass and Miss Vickie's. Sass' book does not provide the detail that makes a reader comfortable with using an electric cooker over the traditional range models. Additionally, the recipes are adequate. I do a lot of pressure cooking during the Winter months but I rarely use this one. Miss Vickie's cookbook has become my pressure cooking bible."
4,good carryon or overnight suitcase,used to replace one very similar .... all the pockets and the roominess is perfect. You can choose to carry by handles or overshoulder.
3,quality was only fair,I received the bag in the expected time. The leather quality was only fair but I did like the organization of the bag. The pictures made it appear larger than it was. I am afraid that this bag will not hold up very long. All in all it is a decent bag for the price.
3,BLACK LEATHER TOTE BAG,"This is a very nice bag. The only problem was that the clasp on the shoulder strap was broken, rending it useless. I'm going to have to have it fixed as the shoulder strap is important to my son."
3,Two year review,I have toted this bag to the firehouse every third day for two years now and here's how it's holding up.The handles were the first to go. The outer covering sharted wearing out after 9 months. Now the leather is totally cracked and worn away and I carry it with the inner cord showing through. The sides are soft leather and not very durable. You have to be careful what you bonk it on because the leather rips easilly. I liked the bag because of all the pockets and compartments but it has not proven to be the least bit durable. I won't be buying another because I need a less fashionable bag and a much more durable cordura nylon or similar bag.All the zippers still work at least :-)
2,"Good quality, BUT...","Pros: The quality and ""fit and finish"" are fine. Not too big, not too small.Cons: TERRIBLE leather tanning/chemical black dye smell. Can't get rid of it. Smells up a whole room.This bag is -not- recommended."
1,Still amazed by the condition of this item,"This bag arrived is such horrific condition. It was folded onto itself and was stuck together. My purchase was in December, so it couldn't have been from the heat. The outside leather had scratched on it and looked completely warped and worn. Was it left in the rain at some point? Also, the metal loops on the strap were covered in rust. I was extremely disappointed. This was supposed to be a holiday gift."
4,"Great bag, great price","Purchased this bag to replace an old one. Wasn't sure how the leather quality would be considering the low price ($25)but am very happy with it. The smell of the leather is not overwhelming as other reviews have said. The size of the bag is larger than I expected which I'm pleased with. Overall, a very well made bag for a great price."
1,Poor Quality,"Poor quality sewing on the straps has ruined this bag for me. I was pleased at first, but every handle has torn at the seam and the shoulder strap broke as well. Do not buy this if you plan to use it on a regular basis."
4,This book is a keeper!,"Howard-Snyder's book is an excellent resource for anyoneinterested in recent trends in the philosophy of religion.Not only does it reproduce in one convenient volume severalof the major papers on the topic in the last 15 years, itincludes several new works by some of the foremostparticipants in the ongoing debate (Stephen Wykstra, AlvinPlantinga, Bruce Russell, and William Rowe, to name but afew).Another reason for having this book on hand is itsexcellent bibliography, both of the works cited in theessays which comprise the volume itself, but also of thewider literature on the subject. As William Alston says inthe book's final essay, these are not likely to be the lastwords on the evidential argument from evil: but they dorepresent, at least in my opinion, the best collection ofwords on that topic produced to date."
5,Nickorama21's review,I think that mythbusters is a great show for people of all ages. it's creative and educational (sometimes). There are many great episodes for you to watch and learn!!!
5,Compact strip,I wanted a compact power strip that would fit into an electronics organizer i had purchased. This fit the bill. Works perfectly.
4,Iceman review,The story of the Iceman was fun to read because it's about people who found a dead body in the ice and because it had cool pitchers.
3,Not our favorite,"We have the little Bunglie mutt dog from Jelly Cat and he's my 3 year old's favorite lovie, so when looking for a potential lovie for his little sister, we looked no further than Jelly Cat. But this kitty disappoints. He's more firm than the dog and not nearly as cuddley. He's also larger than we expected, and despite his firmness, still doesn't sit up on his own like the pictures suggest. We're returning him and starting over in our search."
5,Jelly Purrfect...,"I love all JellyCats and when I see them I get them...this one though has been more special to me than most, partly due to its size...he's quite long and his tail is even longer! The fur is kind of soft but it has a curl to it which makes it more whimsical in my opinion. All JellyCats look floppy and not durable but in all honesty they can take the heat of most wear and tear an average plushie endures daily. I wouldn't think I'd risk getting them too dirty though especially the ones with this kind of fur because I'm unsure in how well it would wash."
4,some weaknesses but she loves it,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday. It has some weaknesses: the wheels don't allow turning, the horse doesn't stay attached, the carriage is really too narrow for 2 dolls (so the door keeps popping open when there are 2 inside.) She was disappointed that there is no seat for a driver. Still my daughter loves it and it was her favorite birthday present. She mostly plays with the carriage and the horse separately, which seems to work better."
2,junk,"My 3 yr old got this for Christmas last year. It's very pretty, but pieces fall off constantly. The horse reigns keep falling off the carriage, so you can't pull it with the horse. The doors also fall off the carriage easily. The feather for the top of the horse's head, and the wheel caps also fall off. My daughter mostly uses the horse to have Barbie ride on. Would not recommend."
3,Horse needs help,"I bought this toy for my 5yr old and it's ok. The only problem I had was that the horse does not stand up very well. You can't pull the horse with out the ranes coming off, but my kid has the whole cinderalla series so she does play with it. Everything else is fine."
4,Mattel Disney Princess Twinkle Lights Carriage,"The Carriage is really sweet; my grandaughter loves it. Only drawbacks are as follows: 1)The horse needs a better fastening system to the carriage, it keeps coming undone during play. 2) it would be nice to fit both Cinderella and the Prince in the carriage, currently only Cinderella fits."
2,Expensive and easily breakable toy,"My daughter loves anything Cinderella. So when Santa brought the entire Cinderella set (castle, dolls and carriage) she was over the moon, until one week after Christmas. My 3-year old gently tapped the foot-step located on either side of the carriage that makes the lights go on, only to have it snap right off the toy! Super-glue was ineffective to fix the damage. She was so upset to have her toy break so soon after Christmas. Horse doesn't stay up, halter and reins constantly fall off. Very disappointing quality considering the price tag!"
4,"Not perfect, but loved!","My 4 year old ( who believes she IS a princess) loves this carriage. I felt that it could have been made better. It is a tight fit with Cinderella and the prince, however she makes them fit! The horse does not stay attached to the carriage, and tends to fall over often. It would be nice if you could make the lights stay on while they are inside, but they only stay lit for a few seconds. Like the other reviewer said, music or actual twinkling lights would make you feel a little better about spending $35.00. However it is a favorite of hers and anyone other child that visits, including her cousins that are 7,9, and 10 years old!Overall it makes the kids happy and I guess thats worth the money."
3,Nice windscreen....maybe.,"I think this is a nice windscreen, I like the extra height that the Sport Touring version gives me. But, I feel it is a little flimsy, the material is thinner than the stock windscreen.But, overall I am pleased with it."
3,Another Differential Geometry Book,"I bought this book as a supplement, and I wish I hadn't. It's more archaic and has a large amount of 'hidden' steps than most mathematical books. It has problems, but no solutions. Not recommended for the physics, applied physics or self-learner. It's really aimed at the 'hard-core' mathematicians, and even they would have to have some experience/guidance in differential geometry.I have an MS in physics, and found this book to be very difficult to get information out of. It has a few nuggets, but can only be seen after going through other books. It might go well with a good lecturer, but as a self-studied person, this is not the way to go."
3,Curious book.,This book is fasted paced and uses somewhat unconventional notation. Reading the first few chapters I didn't really get that much out of it because of how fast paced and terse it is. I would recommend Elementary Differential Geometry by Andrew Pressley.
4,Expensive but worth the investment,"This magazine is excellent if you are serious fly tier. If you are just looking for some cool patterns to tie and catch a couple of fish, y o u t u b e and g o o g l e should offer you everything you are looking for. But for the serious tier, this magazine is great. Lots of great advanced patterns and techniques. I only wish it were at least bimonthly rather than quarterly."
2,Its ok but I wouldn't spend $15 on it!!!,I purchased this book thinking that it was going to be very good. I was suprised to find out that it was NOT! There are some good pictures and a fairly lengthy bio on every actor (the longest is SMG) but alot of facts in the book are wrong. I guess you have to be a die-hard fan to notice them but I was dissapointed. There were errors that shouldn't have been such as the name of SMG's character in I Know What You Did Last Summer. I found the summarys of the episodes to be very wordy and there were to many author feelings added to them. All in all I didn't find it very good.
1,Great movie. Utterly abysmal transfer.,"Don't get me wrong - the film itself is a gem.This transcription, however, is really bad. The original is 16:9, and the transcription is 4:3. There's none of that pan/scan stuff, which would be bad enough in itself - they just cropped the edge of the screen. To call it 'amateur' would be an insult to amateurs. Think 'bootleg copy'.This is the second example of crappy transfers from European productions that I've come across in the last couple of weeks. Both involved British productions currently unavailable in the US. I assume the business model is to provide USA-compatible copies of difficult to obtain European productions (c/f A Month in the Country), hoping that the target audience will accept anything.We don't. Anyone feel like producing something worth buying?And just to repeat - the rating is for the transfer: the film is at the very least ten stars."
1,Cropped and Crappy,"Bullshot - what a great movie. It's a shame there isn't a DVD company out there that realizes this and is willing to give it the proper release it deserves. I picked up this DVD and couldn't wait for it to arrive - I'd been hoping for it to come out on DVD for many years. What a disappointment to see what a bad job was done on the transfer. Looks like a bad VHS copy; not even widescreen and the edges are cropped (actually ruining some of the visual jokes in the film). The extras - trailers for other ""Handmade Films"" titles like ""A Private Function"" are obviously from VHS (they look like they have tracking issues at the bottom of the screen). Betcha if people read this revue and decline to buy the DVD, the assumption will be that this is an unpopular title that won't sell. Which is a shame."
3,Big Contrast With Original Play,"I was one ov thousands who saw the production ov Bullshot Crummond in San Phrancisco back in 1978 at the now extinct Hippodrome. And I anxiously awaited the philm version, and even more so because it was being produced by George Harrison's Handmade Philm company. A bit dissapointed, I must say. The play was screamingly phunny, the movie was not. About the only thing that peaked my interest was Ray Cooper and Larry Legs Smith, both ov whom are connected with Harrison, and Connolly, who I think is one ov comedy's genius's. And the inclusion ov the Henley Armada. Otherwise, because the movie strayed so phar away phrom the play, and the phact that the movie was written by the same people, makes one ponder why."
4,Excellent for what it is,This was a great mouse and keyboard combo. The keys felt good on the keyboard and the mouse was both comfortable and quite functional.That said the two devices did use quite a few batteries which always seemed to need replacing. I have since gone back to using corded devices.
4,Very useful product,"My table looks neat since I got this one. Works well without problems, though battery life of the mouse is a small issue."
5,Great Product,"The Logitech Cordless Freedom Optical is an awesome keyboard/mouse combo. I've had mine for years and it has yet to fail me once. Sometimes it loses its wireless connection or it doesn't detect right, but I think thats just something you have to deal with in the earlier stages of wireless desktop computing. The mouse is very comfortable and the keyboard lets me type for hours with minimal discomfort."
2,Great Mouse & Quick Death Keyboard,"Hard to review the keyboard, it only lasted 3 days before simply stopping working. However, during its brief life it convinced me that I hate white on black keys so I have not bothered with it. The cordless part of the keyboard is for me almost irrelevant.Mouse is another matter. Freedom is not having to drag a mouse tail around. Mouse alone is worth the purchase price. I would like 1 extra key, but that is minor.Do not expect to get any tech support; there is no way to interact except to download drivers."
2,Attention Non-wireless users,"The keyboard and the mouse works with no problems, it deserves to get a good score.However, there are some personal issues that I have with it.For the keyboard, I feel that the tilt angle is not high enough as I've been using Microsoft keyboards all my life.For the mouse, I switched from a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer to this one. I feel that the movement is not as accurate as my wired mouse. Also, the batteries add to the weight of the mouse which makes it tiring job to use the mouse. If you don't need to use the mouse or keyboard acrosss the room, I personally suggest sticking with a wired mouse."
2,Not as great as everyone says it is..,"Yeah, well at first I was excited about the keyoard, the way it looked and the fact that it was wireless, but I have had problems from day one. The batteries last ok, and the set up was not very difficult, but there is a sequence of keys that causes the Logitech website to pop up in the middle of your work causing you to lose EVERYTHING> I used to type really fast ans when I made a mistake I would go back and fix just as fast, but without knowing the sequence of keys that causes this problem, I have to be super careful and type at snails pace. It's not the keys that are used to set up your internet keys, it's soome other way ... It's happende during long e-mails ...,gone..buying products at checkout..gone..it really [is frustrating]."
5,"bought it for multi media controlls, got much more","I bought this keyboard and mouse set up for one reason, the multi media controlls, and the fact that it was wireless. I planned to use it as a remote for my computer, which is attachecd to my sound system. before this I had no way to change tracks in winamp from across the room. So i went out and dropped 90 bucks when it first came out... to use it as a remote. once i set it all up, including the buttons, it made my day to day cyber life much easier. By far i got a ton more than i expected. I would buy it again, and after like 4 days, my roommate, who laughed at me for spending so much, bought one too. Get the keyboard, and bask in the freedom it provides."
4,Takes a little getting used to...,"I just received this product yesterday and immediately replaced my old keyboard and mouse with it. I think that the cordless part is great. It was a breeze to set up and start to use. I guess my biggest problem is that I have so many buttons that I am not used to utilizing. Another little problem is that there are several places for them where you push a button and you automatically go to ""their"" pre-chosen web pages. Like this finance page. There is one touch control for ebay. Maybe I am the last person in the world that doesn't use Ebay, but I don't so I don't need a button for it. The design and set up part was great. There are a few things that I will work around now...it is generally a very good system."
4,"Great Product, but hard to get tech help","I bought this for my mother who does computer work. The keyboard is great and it makes typing so much easier and I recommed it to anyone who types for a long time every day. However the installation was easy, I thought, the keyboard connected fine, bu the mouse does not work. And there is no one to call for tech help. I had to call my companies computer specialist to figure out what went wrong with the installation. If it wasn't for the mouse not working I would have given it a 5 star rating"
5,Lovely,i have not had one problem whatsoever with this keyboard/mouse. i would recomend it to anyone.
1,quality is not logitech's watchword,"I bought two logitech remote keyboard with rodents. After perhaps 60 days, the rodents died. Logitech said ""gee, we only warrant our products for 30 days.""So I switched to other brands, even the hated MS for rodents that worked. Oddly, the Logitech keyboards still work."
1,This Product is a JUNK...,"I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. I really like the keyboard , it works flawlessly , if you dont bother about the battery stuff. But the mouse is really bad. It consumes a lot of battery, the first pair lasted me 5 days as i am a programmer.The mouse hangs up , even though the key board works, so I have to shut down the computer and restart it. The keyboard so far seems to be out of problem.I would not recommend this product for intensive computer users. Unless they want to keep on changing batteries every alternate weeks. And secondly if you have a patience to reeboot when even the mouse stops working. ...Over All , the product is still in the infant stage of development. hopefully they may come out with some rechargable keboards and mouse in the future just like our cordless phones.This product really S U C K S"
2,annoying mouse wheel,takes 2-3 clicks before the page starts scrolling and when it does start scrolling it does it in a choppy way. not smooth. switching direction on the wheel means that the page scrolls in the direction it was previously going first and then it goes in the direction you want it to go.very annoying.
4,Attn: Dvorak users,"This keyboard is very slick and the keys have really nice action; however, I use the dvorak layout with this keyboard and was surprised to find that the stems on the bottom of the keys are rectangles (not squares). Thus, not all the keys can be popped and swapped. When I rearranged my keys to suit my layout, I had to turn four keys sideways to make them fit. Even in light of this, this keyboard is by far the nicest and most comfortable I've ever owned."
5,"Good Company, Good Product","The company is logitech, and what else is expected but great products. There are several good things about this product. Its easy to install, its easy to use, and one can sit in bed, chair or almost anywhere in the troom where the computer is, and still type. This is very helpful when you are on the phone or doing something else, and you wanna be on the computer at the same time. Not only is this product very sleek looking, but it also is a great product. The one CON that comes with this product it....the price, its very expennsive, but I would say its worth every penny. Lastly, This is a package deal, you get two of the same type of product, they a re compatible, they look alike, and they are made by the same company. This is great, you dont have to mix and math to find the best mouse and keyboard for yourself. Buy the product."
3,Watch out for the REBATE!,"I sent in my rebate request in October and still haven't received it yet! It's a nice keyboard and mouse, but the rebate center is totally incompetent. First they said that I sent in the wrong UPC because they thought it was for $10 for the mouse only instead of the $20 for the combo. Now it looks like they are sending me $10. It's been totally frustrating working with Logitech (parago.com)to try and get my $20 back. So do NOT buy this based on getting the rebate back. You may strike out like I have."
1,Logitech itouch,The mouse became hard to control after only 2 months of use. It won't go where you want it to go. One of the rubber pieces that the wheel spins against (inside) seems to be decomposing.
2,"Good Keyboard, bad mouse","I really liked the keyboard, but the mouse didn't feel quite right. It felt too small in my hands and it was hard to control. The pointer seemed to lag as well. I found it hard to navigate with this mouse in most First Person shooters. Another thing I hated about the mouse is that it's always on even when the computer's off."
1,Should be ashamed of themselves,"These condoms are distributed FREE by NYC to organizations who sign an agreement agreeing to then distribute them FREE to people who need them. You are not meant to apply for these free condoms and then turn around and sell them online, and mark up the shipping cost to over $6. They are taking advantage of a non-profit program set up to help at-risk people and they should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Soft and pretty,"This sweater is soft cashmere grey with lime green and a nice blue around the forearms. I like it a lot. The only thing I would comment on specificly is that the buttons that decorate the neckline are somewhat metallic and one of them is in the shape of a heart. I didn't like this at first because hearts on my clothing is not really my style, but it really just blends in and overall the sweater fits very nicely. The v-neck is not too low cut, definitely a nice sweater for work in a business casual office setting."
5,Kids love it,My daughter is sensitive and can't tolerate any other DHA's. It is smaller than the adult size and bigger than the childs.
5,No fishy taste,These are very good dha vitamins. I've never experienced fishy aftertaste as I've heard some other fish oils can cause. I used these along with prenatal one vitamins from Rainbow Light.
5,Perfect,"Small, and they smell good, I am really pleased with this product. They are strawberry flavored in case you burp after taking them, but I haven't experienced that yet."
3,Good CD,"Not my favorite cd, but worthy of keeping in my library. My expectation was set a bit high for this, but was a bit disappointed."
5,Outstanding!!,This product is outstanding. I ordered it and it arrived right on time and perfectly well.Thanks Amazon.
4,Good tasting water,"We have been using bottled water for years, not knowing the water quality of our purchases. The Paragon Countertop works well, producing good tasting water. We also appreciate that the filter needs to be replaced only once a year."
4,Great addition to your kitchen,"Makes coffee, tea, pasta and plain water taste better. Cheaper then buying bottles, pur or brita every 2 weeks. Use it for evrything. Only wish there was a shut off at the tap. It does start to drip for a bit after you turn the water off. Does that more and more as teh filter gets dirty. I will deal with that to have to replace teh filter only once a year. That's the cost of 3 fridge pitcher filters that last only 2-3 weeks. Invest and save. Save money, your health and teh enviroment. Less trash in long run."
1,Less than helpfull,"If you ask a child why they have blonde hair, they might respond with a simple 'because'. To the child this may be a perfectly reasonable response.Such are the attempts of the good Dr. Boice in this book. The questions that are raised are answered with a childish depth and tend to raise more questions than they answer.This is by no means a comprehensive work. The questions that Dr. Boice claims are the most common questions about the bible I have never heard of before.In all, I believe that a total of seven questions are covered in this book. One of which is dismissed as being covered in a paper by another author (who has written the forward to this book), and being to lengthy to bother with in this book.Very disappointing."
4,Classic book on shock waves,"Title self-explanatory. This is a standard reference for all of shock wave theory. Many of the mathematical methods in the book are now obsolete. i.e. We do things computationally now. Still worth having on your book shelf. Excellent coverage of characteristic rays. I have made ""powerpoint"" presentations based on the material in this book, so it must be worth something."
4,Great scope for the price,"I purchased this spotting scope for back country hunts and the shooting range. For the price it is a wonderful scope. It is not as clear as some of the high dollar scopes, but competes with the medium priced optics (e.g., Nikon, Leopold, etc). It is extremely compact and light weight. It is very clear and crisp even at the 36 power. It doesn't give you eye strain even after long periods of use. I would highly recommend this scope if you are looking for a small light weight scope when cost, space, and weight are an issue."
4,Nice book,A very nice compact book on the procedures for filing patents and dealing with challenges. Written by someone who has a valuable amount of experience in this area.
4,Bob Does His Job:,"My 3yr old Grandson enjoyed this episode. It was a little different for him because he's more used to an energetic fare like The Imagination Movers or Spiderman. That said, the slower pace did us both good and now its time for some Elmo. Gotta go :-)Bob the Builder - Scoop's Favorite Adventures"
5,awsome little machine,I recently purchased this sewing machine and i love it! So far it has exceded my expectations and has been very reliable.something that I noticed on the website was that the model number listed for this machine doesnt match mine ....I hope its an error on the website. The model number on my machine says 8260 and the number on this one is the 8620.....odd.
5,Simply Superb !,"Threshold have achieved what I would have considered impossible after their last two outstanding releases: they exceeded themselves yet again!Music so perfect and intense... it almost hurts.These guys just never let you down when it comes to powerful melodies, catchy choruses, brilliant -yet never overboarding- musicianship, meaningful and thought-inspiring lyrics all interwoven into one great masterpiece of music. Divine!They rock like Rush, master like Dream Theater, space like Floyd and yet create their own magical soundscape world that makes them stand out from other bands like a beacon in the night.Something truly special & refreshing.Highlight of the year 2004!"
2,Masterpiece!,"----EDIT-----I'm sorry threshold, I was wrong...this is a really great album.I can never say how wrong I was, high recommended this album is!"
3,"Solid, nothing great here","Again, the masses that praise early on, are the absolute die-hard fans that are just pleased that their favorite band has a new realease.Reality is that this CD is ""Par for the course"" in terms of the song quality. No tracks are bad, but on the other hand, nothing here is great either.I have to say that I feel let down by this release as I was expecting so much more based on the previous reviews, and especially after viewing the live DVD - Critical Energy, which was great due to the diversity. There is nothing new or inspired here.Best CD's so far are Wounded Land and Hypothetical"
2,Dull and uninspired,"There is not much more I can say. The guitar playing is solid as usual. Beyond that there is nothing about Subsurface that is particularly special other than, on the whole, this CD seems less progressive and more fluff. The last track is especially cheesy."
5,"Intense, powerful, extraordinary!","Anyone who says Threshold are less than awesome aren't progressive metal fans and never will be. I'm dumbfounded as to why they aren't as popular or even more than Dream Theater. The live CD is just incredible and explains why I feel that way. I've never heard a band reproduce music on stage so perfectly that sometimes I can't tell if it's live or studio until I heard that CD. Subsurface is progressive metal to the extreme of talent in every way imaginable. I also loved Clone and critical mass just as much. It seems that so many other bands have one or two great cd's and fizzle out. Queensryche is one of those bands, but Threshold seems to achieve the same or greater level of excellence each time. Buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good... but not great,"I was quite disappointed when I popped Threshold's new album in the CD player and noticed the blandness and the lack of diversity percolating all songs... Don't get me wrong, I actually like their music a lot, but I think they weren't able to top Hypothetical (maybe I haven't had time to get into their last work, I don't know...)In my opinion, Critical Mass and Clone are better than Subsurface 'cause they're far more diverse and inspired. If you're new to the band, avoid this and buy Hypothetical or the other two albums mentioned. You can also try their older stuff (Wounded Land, considered a great debut album, or Psychedelicatessen)."
2,I'm so disappointed!,"I bought this book thinking it would be a _general_ guide to the restoration of classic car components. But when I received it I discovered that (other than a brief chapter on shop tools and methods) it only covers the restoration of very specific items... and unless you are restoring THAT SU carb or THAT Motorcraft distributor or THAT whatever, the book is pretty useless. And on top of that, the book focuses on BRITISH stuff. I'm a Ford Model A fanatic and was really disappointed to find that this book was of no use to me at all. Save your money, guys..."
2,It makes me tired just thinking about it!,"This was an assigned book for my college History course, and I can say that I pity all those poor students who have to read this book too. While the content is actually pretty decent, each section is far too long. I had to drink two cups of coffee for every essay, and even then if I didn't have notes I wouldn't have remembered a word. All I can say is highlight what's important, and learn to speed-read!"
5,What a treasure of a book.,"Rachel and her sister inherit a million dollars each from their grandmother...the only catch is she had to live in grandma's house for a year with a husband, she doesn't have. I was absolutely charmed by both the story line and the characters, which all pulled and tugged on your heartstrings. Ms. Harte did an amazing job in plotting this emotional story about a small town and families who had many things to settle from their early childhoods. The love story is intense. I highly recommend this sleeper of a book that I am sure has no where received the acclaim it deserves. A not to be missed book that will be remembered for a long time. A definite keeper. Kudos to Ms. Harte for a job well done."
1,quantity not as advertised - avoid,"I ordered this expecting 24 bulbs and only received 4! The online catalogue description is wrong or the order was short shipped. Given the low cost, it is not worth the hassle of paying for freight and sending it back. Very annoying."
4,AirBake Baking sheets,"These are great and make some damn good cookies, however my only issue would be that they dent quite easily and practically need to be stored separately in their own space."
5,Love Them!,"I replaced all my old cookie sheets recently. These new airbakes are wonderful! Just the perfect sizes for big or small projects. (Only one problem -- will have to find a new recipe for spritz cookies, as the won't adhere to the non-stick surface when being squeezed from the press.)"
4,Good book!,"I tried teaching my 5 year old to read on my own with just a Dr. Suess book. It wasn't working, and we were both getting frustrated. Then I found this book online and tried out the 2 free lessons that are available. My 5 year old picked up on lessons easily. I like that there is a sequence to this and I like that phonics is being used. I would recommend this book to both parents and teachers."
5,Inlove with this book,"I picked up this book in the library and tried with my 4 yo. It worked easily. First, whoever came up with the layout is genius or simply understood which colors and sizes easiest to grasp. It is all black and white with almost no pictures (just a few to help with the first sound of the word). I hate those busy books that have million pictures, colors that stress out the children's mind even though nobody realizes that. It also has a great advice on how to go about the lessons.I will be buying their math lessons books and will be on the look out whatever else this author has. I wish they would have study books for adults and I am serious. I also love DK reference books on pretty much all subjects (I used to drag their travel guides all over for my travels although they all weigh a ton, they use high quality paper and you never need a tour guide when you have a DK book with you). Not related to this book but I thought I would share"
5,Structured approach on learning to read.,I started The Reading Lesson with my daughter when she was 4. Now at 6 she is way advanced in her reading skills (reading at grade level 2). The book is very eazy to follow and well laid out. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to give their kids a jumpstart into reading.
1,doesn't work on mac,doesn't work on iMactried to get support and that didn't work either!waste of money do not buy this
2,Just didn't do it for us,"I sort of hate to be a debbie downer here but this just didn't do anything for my daughter. She knew the letters and sounds of the letters but she totally resisted doing anything in this book. It seems to be the short words and repetition of those words, for instance if the word was ""cat""..she'd make a face and say fat cat rat blat blat blat. (my interpretation is ""I'm not a moron so stop forcing this gibberish on me"")What has worked for her, and beautifully so is the McGuffey eclectic readers.Also, it is probably more respectful to the human being who is your child to allow them their childhood and not begin lessons until they are ready."
1,WORSE THAN DREADFUL!!!!!!!,"this book is SHOCKINGLY BAD;maybe we didn't understand the teaching system, but it has great long texts with little or incomprehensible punctuation.it seems that the texts are written by someone who barely speaks english.how can a child learn from reading idiotic paragraphs in baby-talk, with no capital letters, no commas, no inverted commas?THIS BOOK IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIREWOOD BASKET;LOOK FORWARD TO BURNING IT!my 7 year old daughter and 11 year old son at least had a good laugh reading this nonsense;an excerpt:Everyone says that Ping can sing.Sing us a song,Ping,we asked,a beautiful song."
5,Great basic phonics reading book!,"This gives a basic starting point to teach reading. It is step by step with sounds and blending and very simple to follow. They quickly progress to reading stories, which my 3 year old loves. By the end they are reading on a solid second grade level. Since my daughter is only 3 I also add puppets and games myself to go along with teaching her, but we use this book as our guide and go through one page at a time. The best part is they qickly progress to READING. By that I mean they are not required to learn ALL letters and sounds. It starts out with the 5 most commonly used letters and sounds and then starts forming words out of those almost immediately. Then each lesson, (which is SEVERAL pages - don't be fooled by the title. It may be 20 lessons, but each lesson takes a week or two depending on how fast you move.), adds a 3-4 more sounds until they know them all and are reading. I would definitely recommend it!"
2,Not a great program,I haven't been too pleased with this program. I think you'd be better to go with 100 Easy lessons. This does not provide a structured methodical program that really teaches how to decode the words. It seems like they jump too quickly through the lessons and I think rely too greatly on site reading. My son did not enjoy the lessons and groaned when I brought the book out. Some of the work pages were fine but overall the program is lacking.
4,The Reading Lesson-Helping teach disadvantaged children to read,"Hi there,I am currently mentoring a 9 year old from a residential children's home in a programme similar to ""Big Brother, Big Sister."" The child cannot read, is in Grade 4 and struggling at school. I decided to buy ""The Reading Lesson"" to assist me in teaching her how to read.The book has been a great help to her. She has just completed the first lesson and her recognition of simple words, as well basic sentence construction is already starting to improve.It's always a challenge with disadvantaged children and in South Africa, our schools sometimes have 50 children to a class, putting a lot of stress on the teacher. The Reading Lesson is helping me make a developmental impact on a young child's life.Thank you.MeliniThe Reading Lesson: Teach Your Child to Read in 20 Easy Lessons"
4,Great!,"It helped my kids put the pieces together for reading. I think it was lesson 15 when I realized my child was really reading. I honestly mixed the Bob the Builder books, with this just to mix it up a bit. But within a few weeks my 4 year old was reading. A child's mind is amazing, and my son was reading quickly with this and the Bob the Builder books. It was very easy. I think this book helped everything click, and prevented guessing. If you have little patience, first start with the Leap Frog Letter Factory video. Your child will learn the letter sounds within a few days of watching the video. Then move on to this book. After the first 10 lessons (just a few days) let your child try the Bob the Builder books. Of course every child is different, but this worked for mine!!"
5,Great Book and Other Resources,"This book worked beyond my expectation. My 4 year old loved the book and the exercise pages (matching words with pictures and coloring pages etc.) in it -- I actually had to make copies of the exercise pages so they can be reviewed at a later time. We finished the whole book recently and now my child like to read and can read a lot of words. Now I'm looking at their other resources such as ""verbal math"" and ""the writing lesson"" to provide other enrichment."
5,The best learning to read product ever,"My four year old daughter, is on her 17th lesson of the Reading lesson. She basically completes 2-3 pages a day.We started in early February, 2011 and we're hoping she'll finish the 20th lesson come September when she starts Kindergarten. We are very excited to see her reading books from the library and able to read the instructions from work sheets as well as know all her sight words. She's able to sound out longer words all on her own. I can't thank your product enough and have already made a point of recommending it to all of my friends who have 2-3 year olds. We also have the primary writing skills work sheets which have helped her tremendously on her writing skills. Her writing is far from sloppy and is neat and readable.Again, I can't thank you enough. My only regret is I didn't have the products around when my eight year old son was 3 years old."
3,Not What I Expected,"Due to the spectacular reviews, I decided to buy this program to teach my son. It started out wonderfully and I though it was perfect, but after awhile I began to have concerns. First, it frequently places periods after groups of words that are not a sentence. An example would be the words, ""the fat cat"" followed by a period. Secondly, they attempt to make sentences out of words that have already been taught so unfortunately some of them make no sense. Example: the rat sat at the rug. My child was confused by the use of ""at"" instead of ""on"". There have been words introduced with sound blends without any instruction. A little bit slip shod. I intend to plow through it, but I am definitely supplementing it with a more structured traditional approach. Again, it started out beautifully, but seems to be finishing much weaker."
5,"Best ""teaching reading"" book","I disagree with the ""christi stringer"" review. One star seems such a harsh labeling. This is never a one star book, even when your child is having difficulty, it is still a great book. Easy to use, parent friendly with a thoughtful and scientific approach to reading."
5,Now I have to take my daughter to Disneyland!,"When my daughter asked ""when can I go to DIsneyland"" I always answered ""When you can read"". She is four years, one month old, and with the help of The Reading Lesson, we're planning to go visit Mickey in a couple of months!I love the way the book instructs me on how to instruct her. She loves the sense of satisfaction she gets when she learns a new word. The lessons are easy to understand, well paced, and combine activities like circling like sounding letters with practicing the new sounds and words. She also enjoys coloring the pictures after she reads the page.I'm buying an extra copy for her preschool, so all the kids can have the advantage of The Reading Lesson"
4,good resource,"My 3-year-old daughter loves the book and software. She asks to read the book and use the CD several times a day. The CD is very easy to use, even for a three years old. She can move from lesson to lesson all by herself.I also love the simple clean layout of the book. There is nothing to side track the young readers. But, I don't like the way consonant is pronounced in the CD. It added a vowel to the end of quiet consonants like c and t. When it teaches sound blending, it has a long quiet between each letter sound. For example, it will sound the cat as C - A - T, instead of cccaaattt (sound each slowly and continueously). I think these are the major reasons that my daughter still don't know how to blen the sounds, though she remembers the letter sounds in the first 3 lessons. (There are 3 new letter sounds in each lesson.)"
4,Praise for the Reading Lesson,This book has kept my 5 year old engaged in the learning process and encouraged her to pick up reading quickly!!! I would highly recommend this book!!!!
1,Very black and white traditional book,"My son refused to do this 6 months into the book. We switched to ""hooked on phonics"" which he loves"
1,Pretty Amateur,"Despite the glowing reviews that convinced me to buy the book for my 3 year old daughter, I wouldn't recommend this. There are 3 areas that it fails:1. On a practical level the binding is poor quality - within a few days the pages were falling out; and for weighty tome such as this, getting pages out of order makes the book pretty hard going. (And it is a large, heavy book - again not suitable for small children, or for an adult to comfortably share).2. On a design level, the choice of typefaces and general layout is weak.3. Most significantly, however, is the fundamental icon set used to convey the letters/phonetics. It is an odd, inconsistent mix of nouns and verbs, and some of them are confusing. For instance, in session 1... working on 'A' for Alligator - my daughter was convinced it's a crocodile. And it went downhill from there.So I'm pleased it worked for some people, but it's not the miracle book some claim it to be. There are some nice ideas, but poorly implemented."
5,Great product,Very good product. it is very helpful. Used it for my 6 year old who was struggling with reading. It really helped her. Great review of everything she learned in the first grade. Plan on using it with my younger child when she gets ready for preschool. Highly recommend.
2,found it tedious and boring,my little ones hated this book. We found it to be very boring. My kids did better with hooked on phonics.
4,Good Deal Overall,"I got this saw about a month ago and have only used it 2-3 times since. After baulking for about 2 months because of the price, I finally pulled the trigger after seeing the reconditioned option (I saved about 200 bucks). The only negative I've seen so far is that the base of the unit looks like it was rusted at one point and it looks like someone painted over a used beatup base with silver paint. The rest of the unit looks new and it seems to work fine. I have no regrets with this purchase. As always, no issues at all with Amazon.Also, I purchased the light over the lazer which was easy to install. Not only does the light illuminate the work area, the line shadow from the light is very accurate."
4,Great ideas bu some seem out of line with ages,Creative resources has a lot of great ideas for educational activities with young kids. My only complaint is that some of the activities seem a little too advanced for the ages listed.
4,A good Resource Book,This is a great book. all the developmental areas have been discussed. Good resource book for parents and for early childhood teacher just lke me.
5,Creative Resources Review,The item arrived promptly and in the condition promised. The seller e-mailed the shipment tracking number and the date of shipment.
3,Not exceptional but not the worst,I was looking for a book of exceptionally good ideas. The lay out of the book is one idea per page so it seems to be over wordy and therefore not many super great ideas for as big as it is. I have yet to use one. I guess I needed something a little more realistic for an 18 month old. It might be better for others than it was for us. If it was more expensive I would be really unhappy but I waited and found a used one for $22.
4,AAAAAMAZING,This product is amazing!!!!! I have naturally light colored hair and my lashes aren't very long or noticeable even with mascara on. This stuff totally makes a difference. It looks like I put on false eyelashes when I use it. I use mine with Two Faced Lash Injection mascara. The only bad part about it is that since it is just the fibers in a tube it's pretty messy when you put it on. I'd just make sure to use it before your foundation.
1,A FAILURE,"I have been a Jakes fan since his 1976 series, which were excellent historical novels, and I live in the Charleston area and have studied the history of the city. This book, however, is a ponderous failure. The depiction of an amazon woman, large and masculine, who has sex with two black men during the civil war, who teaches black children to write and read in the open, who escapes death many times because she is so bold, is a fiction that belongs in the trash not on your bookshelf. Not historical, not to his usual writing. He must now be under the influence of the women's movement to depict a Charleston woman of the Civil War in this manner. A major disappointment - do NOT spend your money here."
4,"Good, not great historical fiction","This, my first Jakes novel, is an engrossing tale of several generations of three Charleston families from just prior to the Revolutionary War to Reconstruction. It's in the genre of James Michener and Edward Rutherfurd but not as well-written. Still, I found it an entertaining and educational read, and would recommmend it to all devotees of historical fiction, especially those who'd want a flavor for South Carolina during hundred years or so covered by the novel.One aspect I found disconcerting and a bit annoying - the deaths of several of the main characters in the narrative don't match the dates shown in the family tree charts that appear in the front of the book.If it were possible I would have given the novel three and a half stars but because I enjoyed it, I went with the four."
3,"Too much history, not enough novel","Jakes is the master of the historical fiction genre. The North & South trilogy and the Bicentennial series were outstanding. I had high hopes for Charleston but was left a bit disappointed. If one is looking for a book that is primarily a history of Charleston, then this book is for you. If on the other hand, you are looking for a great story that that just happens to be set in Charleston from the colonial period through the civil war (as I was), then this work by Jakes falls short. The book covers many, many decades with a clear emphasis on historical fact rather than spinning a compelling tale. It is far from a complete washout, but at the same time it is definitely not up there with his best works."
3,overview,"Though not one of his best works, John Jakes has written a version of the history of this beautiful city as experienced by members of 3 families, disparate but interlocked by their own early histories. He skims over the great cataclysmic events (Revolution, Civil War, fires) in favor of depicting the actions and reactions of his protagonists and antagonists. While a number of these characters are rather cardboard, an important few are well drawn. The same might be said of plotting, which is often predictable (don't know if Jakes is aware of the broad hints he drops) but sometimes intriguing. While this book is far from perfect, it flowed along, contained some interesting moments, and I did enjoy reading it ."
5,By far the best book I have ever read!,"John Jakes book ""Charleston"" is wonderful! If you love history and are looking for a good book, this is the one! His tale over four generations of a Charleston family is a masterpiece. The characters come alive in this book and you learn to love and hate them! John Jakes is my favorite author and I plan on reading all his books. This is a must read!"
1,Don't bother,"Very predictable, poorly written, not what I was expecting from Jakes. I gave up before the end of the Revolution - from what another reviewer wrote, I gave up just in time!"
2,Interesting history but the man cannot write decent prose,"This is an easy way to learn a little about the history of Charleston. But the narrative and the writing are so bad that it makes you wince. It's hard to understand what the role of the editor was, especially when dialogue is called for. Any good editor should have been able to sharpen up this silly unrealistic blather. The narrative is like the Perils of Pauline, with people being thrown under trains, eaten by crocodiles, etc. The reality was bad enough without all this dopey violent melodrama being dragged into it. Hard to understand how anyone can be a ""fan"" of such a mediocre writer."
4,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this but felt like it was missing something, maybe just not long enough to have filled in some of the gaps."
3,Same basic story as North & South,"Outside of the history lesson Jakes hands down, the basic plot and characters closely resemble his North & South Series.I listened to the abridged version on CD. Dylan Baker the reader was excellent. Too bad he was reading such boring material. If I was actually reading this book, I know I would have quit about 100 pages into it.If you like gothic romance, this book may be suited for you."
2,BARELY WORTH READING,"There was a time when a John Jakes novel meant adventure, plot, history, sex and excitement. Now a JJ novel is just plodding history. I found most of the story to be underdeveloped and taking a back-seat to sticking in every bit of history that would fit. JJ has been there and done that much better in his Kent Family Chronicles. In my opinion he has not achieved the greatness and richness of those early novels. What a shame. JJ was one of my favorite authors."
4,grand city,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYWhether Jakes intended it or not, Charleston becomes the main character throughout this epic. All others -- British and Americans battling and Yankees and Rebels doing the same years later -- are mere interlopers."
3,Love and Tragedy,This book is a continuous loop of finding love and losing love. It is filled with stories about family against family. It is a true soap opera in a book woven together with the common themes of Charleston and slavery. My eyes were opened to the fact that adultery probably has not increased in our society as much as I originally thought. It has just become less acceptable and therefore more visible as an issue. It also amazes me how you can degrade the life of humans. It had to be extremely hard to change your thoughts on the freedom of blacks when you have lived in a culture ingrained with the idea of a subordinate race.
2,Okay.,"I thought the piece was just the right size and I liked it in white gold, but the stone had no color and I was very disappointed. I will think twice before ordering jewelry again."
3,I Enjoyed this Production BUT...,"I truely enjoyed this revival of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. It has been one of my favorite plays since the original Broadway production with Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. At one time, there was an audio version of that cast (I had it on cassette tape,) which is now out of print. I have looked everywhere! Nobody has it available.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! ---re-release THAT version of the play on CD. It would make a fantastic addition to anyone's collection of spoken word recordings."
4,Brilliant,"This is one of Stoppard's greatest works. He captures the nuances of human behavior in a terrific way and his dialogue is, as always, sharp and full of meaning."
4,Another great play by Stoppard!,"Tom Stoppard is my favorite playwright. Yet, the first time I read The Real Thing, I really disliked it. I didn't find his focus on adultry at all compelling. When I read the play for a second time, I realized that it had a lot of merit that I had not previously noticed. For example, he examines the relationship between polemic and artistic creation, between the artistry of writing and writing which is personal and passionate. Is it a good thing to be able to manipulate words for any occasion, or is it better to feel strongly about what you are writing?"
2,True disappointment,This book is only valid if you believe in the big bang theory of the creation of the universe. It is also light on statistics and gives no detail on the different planets in the universe. You have to buy all the individual books to get that.
3,so so,"This is a cute concept, but my 7-year old daughter played with it for one day and now it sits on the shelf. It doesn't really do enough to keep her entertained. Maybe it would have been better if she were younger."
1,Not impressed,I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. The lips on the doll didn't work and there really isn't much to do with it. She was bored almost immediately. I was hoping for much more out of this toy. In my opinion you shouldn't waste your money.
3,Vivace Review,The first one shipped to us was inoperable. The hour hand did not function properly. A replacement was ordered and received. It works fine.
5,Corelle - Ideal for 5th Wheels,We purchased 2 sets to be used in our 5th wheel trailer for travel. The weight and thickness of the dishes is ideal for limited storage. The Testured Leaves pattern is also inspirational for our lifestyle now that we are retired and moving on to new adventures. My parents had corelle in their travel trailer 30 years ago and I remember how perfect they were for this environment. My kids have them for active young family. Nearly indestructable. Love them and highly recommend them.
4,Great plates -- but the mugs could be better,"We have two sets of dishes -- one was corelle, and the other was not. We finally decided to get rid of the ""non"" for a new corelle set. I ordered two sets from Amazon: one came broken (they really didn't try and cushion the packaging very well at all), while the other was fine. (I returned the broken dishes and recieved a replacement in a very timely fashion. Good service.)The dishes themselves are great: sturdy and attractive. Our only reticence about the set is that the cups are mugs -- normal ceramic mugs not made of that sturdy corelle material. We would have preferred the old type of cups.Still, that didn't prevent us from ordering a third set so that we have enough dishes for guests as well."
2,broken in SHARDS,"We have had this set of dishes for about 1 year. Now we barely have any left. When I was growing up corelle dishes were the best..they did not break. So for my family I decided to buy the same thing. Unfortuatly like many products these days, corelle is not made like they used to be. They certainly break and not only do they break, they break into tiny shards. I would not recommend these dishes to anyone...and I had bought two sets. We just bought some from fingerhut and they are great. At least if they break I know it will be into maybe 2 to 3 pieces. Not a million."
3,I liked this,"I looked for videos on horses this year for my daughter who became infautauted with them. I bought this and two others from Amazon.com My daughter liked this...but she REALLY liked ""A Young American rider"" with Addison Phillips the best. That one was narrated by a peer of hers and taught her not only about horses but also about the values of hard work, discipline and sportmanship."
3,very informative about horses,"This movie shows you the many different ways of riding, from jumping to trick riding, and how to take care of your horse as well."
3,Would have been rated higher but...,"I wanted to rate this book higher. It is well written, high quality, and I still have it not far from my reach. Unfortunately, I just felt like there was a general lack of cohesiveness and flow.It started off great. Chapters 1-4 were excellent in covering project work flow and design approaches (and SOME Dreamweaver integration). Then, just as I was thirsting for more detail, I was hit with chapters on vector graphics, optimization, flash, etc.. Finally, in some later chapters, I discovered there was more detail on the issues I was struggling with from the first chapters. When I jumped to those chapters, I felt I missed some info in between.Any book I review at 3 stars or higher, I recommend to others. I still think it is worth the money. Even though it doesn't have a disc (they are often worthless anyway, and only add cost to production), it is a pretty good deal..."
1,Caution before buying this book!!!,I bought this book two days ago to teach myself Fireworks. The tutorials in this book require files from (a Web site). The site has been down for the past two days. (...)
4,An Intriguing Thriller,"I listened to the unabridged version of this book on tape and found it to be incredibly entertaining. It is long (17 hours on tape) but if you have some time to kill, its definitely worth a go. Although the big secret isn't all that hard to guess and the book does drag a bit in the last third its tremendously enjoyable, in a guilty pleasure sort of way. I forsee this becoming a better than average summer popcorn movie--some of the characters even seem to have been written with big time stars in mind (Harrisson Ford, Danny DeVito, Jodie Foster perhaps). At any rate this is perfect fare for a lengthy week at the beach or a long drive."
4,An ending t o end all endings...,"If you love awesome endings and incredible twists, then this is the book for you without a doubt. OK so it does take some time to develop, but as all good stories should, it more than makes up for it with quickly picking up the pace and building up to a fantastic finish!! The ending is the best you'll ever read..."
4,A good lite read that does raise some questions,"I enjoyed this book and the author's writing style. The plot was some what predictable. I too figured out who was behind the murder or Joe's sister and nephew by page 39. I also figured out what the Dr. was doing once Joe got to Italy. I was also screaming at Joe to read the letter and get it translated. I did not have a problem with him having the money to travel as it was stated that he had a bit of money from his company. He took a leave of absence from his job to conduct the investigation. Granted he wasn't the best investigator otherwise he'd have put the clues together a lot sooner.The last bit didn't surprise me as much as I had hoped, as it was set up a few pages earlier.The questions raised have to do with the premise of the book. If this could be done how long before some one tries it (legally or illegally) with any famous corpse."
2,Disappointing. A (genetic) Protocol of the Elders of Rome.,"Novelist ""Case"" has written a disappointing, Catholic-bashing ""suspense"" novel. The characters lack depth, the plot is slow-moving, and the ""hero"" is an idiot. What really dooms the book in my mind however, is its strong anti-Catholic story line. Without giving away anything, we've heard all this before: in the place of the Catholics, you could substitute Jews, Nazis, Communists, and now aliens from Roswell, etc. running governments, businesses, etc. There are a few interesting ideas in the book, however the strong anti-Catholicism (no, I'm not Catholic) negates these ideas.Finally, ""Case"" establishes at the outset that the protagonist, Lassiter, is a preeminent detective, the head of a huge, multi-national PI agency, however, the character is incapable of connecting even the most basic facts. The reader solves every mystery within the first 100 pages and has to plod through 300 more waiting for confirmation.Ultimately disappointing."
3,longer than necessary,"i feel like im reading the DaVinci Code....i JUST want to get to the point. I think im finally getting there now. The first half was just alot of nuthin. I dont need all the detailed description of every cobblestone in Italy, i just want to know who, what where and when....slow moving book...The good reviews ive read here have made me stick with it."
5,GREAT!,"Uniquely plotted, fast paced, great characters. You will read this book fast just to find out what in the world is going on. And you will not find out until the last few pages. Until then, you won't have a clue! Great plot, and the author moves you along quickly. Mr. Case clearly knows whereof he speaks and conveys his story with talent and skill. Highly recommended."
3,It could've been so much better!,"(Beware of spoilers!) This book had all the makings of a Great Read, but it was way too heavy on investigative technique and much too light on characters I could care about. If only Joe had hooked up with Marie early in the book and they had gone on the run together to protect the child! Instead, we get hundreds of pages of Joe bumbling around alone, looking for a story.""Case"" is a topnotch investigator, I'm sure. Now he needs to learn how to get his characters together before the denouement."
4,Interesting read,"When I began this book, I kept thinking that I had it figured out because of the title's reference to genetics. I read and enjoyed it anyway, so imagine my surprise when in the final chapters I realized I knew very little. This book raises timely questions about the power geneticists have"
1,Abysmal tripe,"If you consider yourself a reader of serious, well-written, well-structured and meaningful novels then avoid this book like the plaugue. The interesting subject matter could have been handled so much better. Cardboard stereotypical characters, tedious plot, contrived action scenes, this book has them all and then some. The whole rambling investigation contained within is simply padding to reveal the final 'astonishing' conclusion that anyone with only half their brain running will have guessed by page 100. A tepid waste of time and effort."
4,Good Page Turner,"I read this book about 5-6 years ago and still remember it well. It came out just in time to dovetail nicely into events of our time - cloning, genetics, in vitro fertilization for 40-50 year old women, etc. While I figured out the twist in the book by about page 70, the plot was good enough to keep me engaged. While I've read others criticize the intelligence of the lead detective, I disagree. The reader has an easier time figuring out the case primarily due to the fact that Case flips back and forth to events in Rome for an omniscient point-of-view. It's a good, topical read and made me a John Case fan."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I can not believe that this book gets the reviews that it does. It is terrible. I finished reading it for the same reason that I might look at a traffic accident, morbid fascination. I could not believe that someone who made themselves rich with their investigative abilities would forget for much of the book that they possessed a letter that explained everything. Or the investigator that does not notice the warning signs and is beaten to a pulp in his own hotel room. It is terribly frustrating when the reader is constantly a quantum leap ahead of the hero. Also, although the idea is a very good one, the science is all but missing. A part of one chapter late in the book is all that is devoted to the science and you will have guessed what is going on long, long before anyone in the book has a clue. Complete with hokey, easy ending. I could go on and on and on.... Oh well, maybe next time."
3,A little far-fetched...or is it? I give it 3.5 stars.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. As a thriller, it was good--definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. It's not so much of a ""whodunnit"" storyline, but a ""WHY was it done"" storyline, and that was an interesting change from the few thriller/mystery novels I have read in the past. When I finally figured out the WHY, I was shocked, because although it is a little far-fetched...it leaves you wondering, ""what if?""Some of the narration, mind you, dragged me down a bit. I just don't think that Joe Lassiter's past love life factors into the story, and yet the author keeps bringing it up. That, and there are certain things (including the main secret) that the reader will figure out long before Lassiter ever does, which gets a little frustrating. Still, if you're a big thriller/mystery fan, or if you enjoyed Dan Brown's books, you will like this one!"
2,run away!,"What a spectacularly mediocre book. For a plot that dabbles across fields as interesting as international private corporate investigation, papal politics, and genetic manipulation, popping to fro between italy, DC and Switzerland, it nonetheless falls on its face. The Boys from Brazil plot is transparent from the beginning yet tortuously dragged out as our moronic protoganist (and possibly the author as well?) is dumbfounded by any scientific term more complicated than DNA. The descriptions and revelations of spycraft, travel, and gene play are generally superficial; only if you were living under a rock for 30 years would they have the cutting-edge, revealing quality that the plot requires. Like many other reviewers, i kept flipping the pages all the way to the end: case does have the sentence-to-sentece storytelling that kept me hoping against hope that this book might redeem itself... but it doesn't. skip it."
4,Impossible but interesting to read.,This story moved fast. It kept the reader quessing for a long time. The ending was a little of a disappointment. Well crafted and well written.
3,Did I read the same book?,"I read mystery thrillers almost exclusively and I think this book was mediocre at best. It started out with a bang and soon started whimpering, and continued to whimper throughout most of the story. I listened to this on audiobook..maybe that influenced me. Although Dick Hill is an excellent reader, the voices of some of the characters drove me nuts.Joe Lassiter is an okay guy/hero, but is a bit slow on the uptake for a very successful investigator..at times I wondered if he was ever going to put it all together.I would have given this 2 1/2 stars if I could have. I will move on to the Syndrome book. I hope it is better."
2,Good plot. Uninteresting character.,"Well, I thought this book had a pretty good plot idea. I gave it only 2 stars because I didn't care at all for the main character. Basically, he was a wuss. Guess I expect a bit more from a guy who owns an international investigations company. Example...He walks into his hotel room and there's some stranger sitting there looking at his computer. He stands there and gawks at him until this guy walks right up to him and beats him up. He was saved my a screaming maid. Later on in the book, he hires a bodyguard FOR HIMSELF! He has no fighting capability at all. And he also had absolutely no personality."
3,Flawed but gripping thriller,"The premise of this book is based on a lack of attention to the details of Catholicism, around which it revolves. For a start, a priest is never, under any circumstances, permitted to reveal the what he hears in confession (remember Hitchcock?!); other errors take away from the enjoyment: St Peter's in Rome is a basilica, not a Cathedral. And so on... but the story itself is really quite good, once you learn to ignore these errors. I read this book just after having finished Micheal Cordy's The Miracle Strain, which I think caused similar troubles-of-the-soul for a minority of reviewers. By the way, I'm Catholic, and I wasn't bothered. If a religion can't withstand a bit of gentle knocking it can't be worth following. raed this book, but don't take it too seriously."
2,Outrageous even though it keeps you hooked,"The beginning of this book really hooked me; I couldn't wait to find out what the whole mystery was. But the more I read, the more preposterous the story became. The main character is supposed to be a talented detective, but at times he's so dim-witted and slow, I threw the book down in frustration. This book really needed a more intelligent hero. Also, as a Catholic, I was offended by some of the issues in the book, especially the main ""mystery"". I thought it was completely ridiculous."
3,The Genesis Code,"This was a good book, but the liberal use of the ""f"" word was very disappointing. It's as if the author suffered momentary writer's block and inserted this profanity to cover his lack of imagination. ""Mr. Case"" is better than that - or could be. He should leave the ""f"" word where it belongs - in the garbage."
2,Overrated,"Based upon reviews here and feedback of friends, I had high expectations, obviously too high. There are far better conspiracy thrillers out there, most without such a ridiculous far-fetched ""gripper"", that in this case the reader can infer by mid-way through the book."
2,300 pages too long!,"This book is remarkably similiar to ""The Miracle Strain"" by Michael Cordy. If you really really really liked that book - you'll quite like this one. Most readers will, I fear, find this effort to be formulaic, contrived and lacking in any real dramatic tension. The only real reason to persevere is because one cannot quite believe that the conclusion will be as predictable as all the clues lead you to expect it to be. Sadly, it is."
2,The world's dumbest Investigator,"I liked the idea and theme of the book. unfortunatly the lead charater, a brilliant investigator, was probably the world's worst detective. The reader can guesse every detail chapters before the hero can put two and two together.The suspense was lost when you kept thinking what a moron the lead was. From forgetting that he had the one Key piece of evidence, a letter that conviently explained it all, in his pocket for half the book. Tjat, and the fact that the investigator's sneaky aproach to finding out iformation was to spill out the whole story to anyone he meets, and he's shocked when the bad guys are on his tail.as for the writing, it's so-so. i found the him repeating phrases all the time and using the same themes."
5,"A captivating drama, sure to please just about everyone.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book, from beginning to end. The plot was mysterious enough to keep the reader guessing throughout, and the author did not give away a single secret. As the plot developed, so did the tension and drama. The characters were well rounded and believable, adding to the distinct flavor of anticipation. It was difficult to put the book down, and I was able to read it in just two days. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a strong read, and willing to dedicate several hours to a most interesting story. The ending is supreme!"
2,"Great topic, should have ended far better than it did","Overall the book wasn't a bad read. The topic of exploring some of the sinister aspects of the Catholic world I found very appealing - especially as I am one ! Unfortunately the book started out promising much but in the end turned out a bit of a fizzer. I was left feeling a great deal more could have been done with the topic - to be honest, the ending was nauseating. However, to the credit of Mr Case (whomever that may be) it certainly makes one want to head off and find out more about the subject."
3,Slow to start. Interesting ending.,This was a slow book to develop. I kept looking for a character I could care about but none of them were really developed enough - ever. The book took forever to get exciting and then the ending was interesting. But I don't think the ending was good enough to make up for the rest of the book's slowness.
4,Great Book.... Horrible Ending,"I love the whole book until the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet, but the folks that have read it will know what I am talking about. it seemed to me that John Case was writing the book and realized ""oops, gotta finish it up. Let's see..."" Up until that part with Joe looking through his binocoulars and seeing the bad guys coming it was an awesome book. I would recommend it to anyone. Great action scenes and a plausible plot. I just hope it doesn't happen."
5,"Hard to put down, thrilling, exciting and very entertaining","""The Genesis Code"" was a wonderful book to begin our book club. Once I started, I could not put it down. I had to know what the confession was... Mr. Case did a fantastic job capturing our minds. His writing style was very exceptional. His explanation of the fertility methods was well done and easy to follow. Of course, there were a few far-fetched ideas in the book, but that is what makes it a great book of fiction. I hope it is made into a movie. I smiled when I read an article on Dr. Seed who wants to carry out cloning experiments. Not only is he as ambitious as Dr. Baresi, but we were able to use his book to explain some of Dr. Seeds ideas. The genesis code is not really too far from reality. I enjoyed it immensely. Great writing Mr. Case. This refers to the hardcover edition of the book."
2,A waste of time for people who know science,"This book is a sort of fantasy based on the topics of bioengineering and Catholicism. But it is VERY clear that the author has no real understanding of either subject. The ideas and events that occur in the book are a joke to anyone with any sort of background in biological science. The only reason I read this book to the end was because I believed that the main theory of the book would turn out to be a red herring. But, no. The implications turn out to be the whole point of the book and, essentially, a huge disappointment.Unfortunately, the characters don't do much to redeem the book. The relationships that build between characters seem to be the result of events that are more convenient rather than realistic. And, in the end, none of the characters have any depth. They're simply two-dimensional figures that pose as the standard stereotypes: hero, villain, and damsel in distress."
4,Thrilling look at ethical dilemnas of the coming age,"I stumbled upon this book and am glad I did! Case examines the potential ethical ramifications of modern scientific investigation. While it's true the reader figures out the mystery before the protaganist does, I was kept on edge wondering how it would all pan out. Quite a good treatment of a difficult and troublesome topic."
2,Interesting concept...,"Theoretically, an intriging concept. However, the sex and testosterone outweighed the science by at least 8 to 1. And the scientific research was poor to midling at best."
1,"the whole book is built on one idea, but it is not enough...","This book rests entirely on one idea, with which you are teased from the very beginning. By the middle, it can be pretty much guessed, but you still have a long way to go before the last sentence finally confirms your worst suspicions.The fact that the main character is the head of the most powerful investigative agency on the planet is also a spoiler, because he can too easily get what he needs at every twist and turn.A further aspect that irritated me was the fact that the authors (a couple, writing under one name) made several mistakes about things Italian (Italy is where a good deal of the book takes place), all of which could have been easily researched. I might be too demanding considering that this is meant for pure entertainment, but even when I read non-scholarly books, I expect some attention to detail.I seriously doubt that I will ever pick out a John Case again."
3,"Very story idea, extremely well-written, but predictable...","I really enjoyed reading this book, but I was oftentimes able to guess the essentials of the plot. I would still highly reccommend this book, but some of it was too predictable. Even still, it keeps you on your toes until the end."
2,"Intersting idea, shallow presentation.","Half way through the book, I was bored with Joe Lassiter's fleeting for the truth. Some of the events that led to the ending were surreal as important clues just fell into place for Mr. Lassiter. The Medical aspect of the book was short-lived and delivered on a junior high level. I picked up the book for its medical possibilities and I put it down very disappointed.Intriguing idea, that could have been presented in a much more believable mannor. I would be very hesitant to pick up another of Mr. Case's books."
4,An intriguing page-turner with surprises to the last page!,"Genesis Code is a Ludlumesque thriller, right down to the creation of Lassiter, the average-guy-turned-superhero. The plot continues to thicken after Lassiter discovers murder and arson surround his sister and nephew's violent death. Lassiter travels the world, utilizing the tools of his high-tech security business to unravel the web connecting a group of religious zealots to the murders. Case delivers his religious and scientific knowledge with perfection, making an exciting and fast read. My teenager daughter picked it up and didn't stop reading for two days!"
3,"Better than Dan Brown, Less than Michael Crichton","I recently read several of Case's books (it's a pen name. who else does this person write as?) and find them all to be entertaining page-turners. Even figuring out the end of this book early didn't slow me down. I enjoyed ""The Eighth Day"" more though. Yes, the chapter divisions and writing feels a bit formulaic, but it's fun. The characterization is much better than what I've read in Dan Brown. But, if you really want to be sucked in and impressed, pick up any Michael Crichton book at the library."
5,Awesome!!!,"This is a superb thriller. Case, with his excellent story telling, keeps us guessing all the way. And even when he reveals the mystery behind the whole thing, near the end, it ain't over. He still hits us with a twist ending, the impact of which is felt only after you've read the very last word."
2,Interesting plot; tiresome characters,"I listened to this book on tape (unabridged). The story was interesting though it took FOREVER to unfold and I had to fight the desire to fast-forward.The characters, however, were incredibly tiresome, especially (unfortunately) the ""hero,"" Lassiter, who shows a remarkable lack of intuition, intelligence, and conversational savvy for somebody who owns his own detective agency.Not only does Lassiter's stupidity get a number of people killed it almost ends his life -- it's unfortunate that the reader is deprived of that happy ending, though."
1,Tedious.,"When I pick up a book of suspense, I expect to be able to find interest in all and each line incuded therein. I found myself skipping lines after lines and pages after pages to find out at the end of the chapter what it really happened. So much background and lack of dialogue makes this book too slow for my liking. (it reminds me of the books by Malachi Martin:tedious, boring, fastidious and utterly uninteresing) Why does it takes a full 4 chapters for a priest to travel from Montecastello to Rome to see a cardinal? Why at page 57 Mr Lassiter is still not conducting an investigation? (considering that the book is 435 pages long). It seems that in order to find a line or two of any interest, one must skip pages after pages of background information, a narrative of unrelated facts, and a summary of character development. After all of that, I asked to myself:WHERE IS THE PLOT?"
5,Amazing thriller,"Anyone who writes a bad review for this book must have read it with one eye closed, because this was one of the best books that I have ever read. It starts out with a bang and keeps you guessing until the very end. You know this person did something, but it isn't revealed until about 200 pages into the book, and even when it is that isn't the end. For anyone that loves mysteries, this is a book that I couldn't put down until I finished it."
2,I expected more...,"I was not impressed with the book at all. I read reviews where the book was a fast pace read, which I like, but to me it dragged. There were only a couple of places in the book that I was on the edge of my seat; the rest was diatribe, painstaking forays and just kind of rambled along.Although, I did enjoy some of the descriptive narrative of the places around the world where the main character had went.The whole precept was hard to believe and I could never get into to why all of this would happen. But even at that it was predictable and easy to figure out what was happening overall. I ended up feeling like it was a waste of my time reading the book."
3,"If you liked Jurassic Park, you'll LOVE The Genesis Code","Instead of baby dinos, we have baby saints! Are other authors wondering where else a little DNA can be scared up for their new book? I am personally more interested in who John Case really is. My guess? James Bamford. He wrote a book called The Puzzle Palace, about the NSA, and also writes for The Washington Post (notable since Case's other book centers around a Washington Post reporter).Do I win a prize if I'm right?"
3,"A page turner, BUT","I enjoyed most of the story, but Joe Lassiter went from the head of a large investigation firm to 'not the sharpest knife in the drawer' in the last half of the book. The plot theme was original and I was wondering how the author was going to tie it toghter. Unfortunately he dragged it beyond the obvious. Still I enjoyed it and would read another of his books."
5,Dickey Betts is hot on this show!,"I really don't see what the other reviewers are saying about Betts being sloppy, drunk or over the hill. He sings the way he has always sang, and maybe this band is not as tight as the ABB, but then who is? Great songs, great and long jams, sharp and melodious guitar solos and great audio quality.His playing here rivals Clapton's in this year's Cream reunion.Between the Cream live double cd and Bett's triple live cd, all jamband afficionados can hear how the original masters still can smoke. Where it all began, indeed.If you like the ABB, southern rock or just great guitar playing, this is a great bargain!"
2,Dickey we hardly knew ye...,"I have to agree with the previous 2 star review of this cd. I was given this set as a gift from an Allman Brothers fan who assured me that Mr Betts was back on form and the music within was top caliber. Sorry to say, as much as I've admired Dickey's playing in the past, this is a sad state of affairs. I can't believe this was even released. Sloppy playing with a band that sounds like the first day of rehearsals at best.I was really hoping DB had gotten his act together. Apparently he hasn't."
2,Dickey is not with it-get off the juice please!!!,This album is a good example of showing how far Dickey has declined in the last few yrs due to his drinking and anger fits--sloppy playing and poor singing--he is not with it any more. I wish Dickey would clean up and play like he could before-he certainly has the talent. Listen to this and the last live allman Bros Alum live with him as mentioned in the other reviews-a sad state from a brilliant singer and guitat player. Dickey --be a Brother and straighten up--we need your talent in the music world--the Allman Bros need you.
3,"Not bad overall, but way too bright for me","I recently (Feb 2009) bought two of the Polk R300's on sale for $50 each for a stereo system. I was running them on my Yamaha RX-V795 ""Natural Sound"" receiver with a Polk PSW10 sub. Music sounded pretty good overall, but the tweeters were way too ""bright"" for me on certain music passages. Cranking the treble knob way down helped, but some sounds were still painfully bright and artificial to my ears. I even experienced this with Robert Plant's vocals on the ""No Quarter"" CD. Maybe I'm just sensitive to bright tweeters, but I ended up returning them and bought a used set of KLK AV5001 3-way speakers, which sound much better to me (and don't need a sub!). I never tried the R300's with movies."
4,Great Value,"These Polk R300 Speakers are great for beginning and budget home theater speakers. I am currently running them on a stereo set up and they are hold up great. I plan on moving them to my surrounds and using another set, probably polk's monitor series, as my main fronts.These are a great value and you will not be disappointed."
4,Great speaker on a budget,"The Polk R300 is great for home theater and good for music. Don't expect to be blown away by the sound of stereo music, but the mids and highs are good, and with a sub sounds great. If you want better, I recommend the Polk 60s, but they are much bigger and more expensive, so if you want a nice sounding small floorstanding at a great price, go for it!"
4,Love it!,I love all of her songs! It's not one that does make me feel the words of her song! True songbird! I would recommend this to someone who wants to take a long drive and need to stay awake or for a get together gospel party!!
5,Engaging Alphabet book for kids,I purchased this book to increase my 4 year old daughter's desire to learn the alphabet. The photos are very appealing and really captured my daughter's attention. I would definitely recommend this book to any parent whose children like dogs.
1,Superficial Overview,"A quick tour through some issues in retirement, aimed for the busy professional without a clear idea of how to switch from working to not working. Short impressions rather than thoughtfully laid out issues. Other books do it better. A disappointment."
3,Voice of the Universe,"I enjoyed the first ones, this one not so much. I hope it's true that the author communicated with God but in my opinion I'm skeptical."
4,Xlnt Guid 2 Wrld Hstry,"In c. 150 galloping pp, author Chris Brazier offers a newly-balanced summary of the entire and astounding mosiac that is the world's history. This reader found much he had only a vague knowledge of - or, honestly, none at all. The organization of the material is forthright. The coverage alloted to a myriad of societies, empires, movements and eras - and especially to women, can be usefully unsettling. The prose is workday. It wins no prize for grace. That may subtly enhance the urgency inherent in the concept. The author admits to political bias. Even so, there are a few passages that seem to stray too far into opinion rather than fact. No matter. The book is highly recommended. I've bought multiple ccs. for giving."
3,Small but cute,"if you need a real bookbag for more than one book, this isnt for you. but it is very cute. i was very surprised to see just how small it was."
2,SO SMALL,"I can't believe they call this a book bag! I received this right before Fall semester and couldn't even fit one of my books in it. So tiny! NOT a book bag!! More like a hand bag, could carry small novels and that's about it!"
4,Synopsis from the back cover,"The three neighboring houses on Maine's seacoast seemed lost in the fog, cut off from the rest of the world. The houses belonged to Vera Waters, her aunt - and now there was a strange new family, who came shrouded in mystery as deep as the fog. Who were the Harpers? Just two men and a woman who, as they claimed, liked the area? If so, why did their first sight of Vera shock them into near silence? And why did Aunt Samantha's astrological readings, usually happy and frequently correct, warn Vera of impending danger? The threat to Vera's sanity and life became brutally clear the day a private investigator arrived in town. One of the Harpers, said Detective Egan, was mad, haunted by an ancient murder - and driven to kill again! Vera, equally compelled, found herself the unwilling bait in a trap more terrifying than her worst imaginings!"
3,WHAT'S THE POINT?,"""The Bachman Cummings Songbook"" marks the first time that the two Guess Who songwriters' career highlights have been assembled onto a single CD collection. Includes all original versions of hit songs from their Guess Who years, Bachman's years with Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Cummings' solo career. Terrific music, of course...I'm just not sure what the point is!"
3,Magnetic tiles,"I purchased this product to help my son learn to read and write. I was a little disappointed with the thickness of the tiles; they are too flexible and I had wanted something stiffer. I also have trouble with them sticking on the magnet board that I had purchased separately. Overall, for the price they were okay, considering there are so many tiles and you can make complete sentences including punctuation. I also liked that the vowels are in red while the consonants are in blue."
1,Not right item,Recieved the wrong item that I cannot use. The company told me that this was an error that the picture on the website misrepresents the product and that they donot have the product in the picture that I ordered. This item needs to be removed or at least change the picture so people know what they are getting. I was given apologizes and promised a refund. So if you want magnetic alphabet TILES like those shown in the picture DO NOT order them from this site because they dont have them.
2,disappointing,"I felt that I could learn a lot from a book touting to be ""high octane"". I didn't think that I knew all that PT had to offer. I did find a few things that were fairly useful but for the most part found myself already knowing most of the book."
4,Pro Tools 7 Session Secrets,"The book is just what I was looking for. It gives me more information and allows me to work twice as fast as I have been.I took a personal hands on course that gave me the basics. This goes into more detail on how to properly use plug-ins. My instructor failed to mention this stuff. Probably so I would spend another $100.00 to find out.Thanks very much,RED"
2,Blatantly inaccurate....,"Unfortunatly, this video on the history of baseball is flawed. The writers and producers of the film seemingly know little or nothing about the game as their are numerous factual errors and misspelling of names (Honous Wagner? ). It doesn't flow very well, either and the portions of facts that are accurate are displayed in an often-not-understandable fashion. The lone bright spot is a rare clip from a silent movie starring Babe Ruth, circa 1925."
4,I Know the Episodes!,"These are the episodes for ""Percy Saves the Day"":Percy Gets it RightWhat's the Matter with Henry?Something FishyThe Old BridgeTrusty RustyBill, Ben and FergusIt's going to be a good video/DVD; but i've seen most of the episodes on PBS."
3,There Once Was An Engine Who Ran Away,"I've never seen the music video! Kate669 can you bring more music videos like Troublesome Trucks & Salty. I'm going to watch a music video called ""There Once Was An Engine Who Ran Away."""
1,"Poorly written, confusing, using too many abreviations","I had to by this book for a class. I thought it would be interesting. Very contrary to my original thoughts this book has become an albatross. It is written for military people, who might have a clue what all the abbreviations are. It is very biased. The author definitely does not have a clue what how a situation might be handled other than in a military fashion. Communists are the scourge of the earth to this guy. If anyone is thinking of using this for a textbook please give your students a break and find something might actually be interesting!"
4,Breathtaking young talent,"Teddy Thompson's voice is stunning, not just it's natural beauty but the subtle delivery I associate with much more seasoned performers. It makes me think of George Jones and Johnny Cash and the way they could turn a song inside out. The arrangements on Separate Ways are similarly nuanced. I'm of his dad's generation, but if I were in my 20s, I'm sure I'd be playing this album non-stop. As it is, I've got it mixed into my playlists."
5,Unique & catchy voice,"I first heard samples from this CD on a Verve sampler CD that I almost threw away without listening. I am glad I didn't! Teddy has quite a unique voice that grabs your attention on the first listen - somewhere left of James Taylor with some youthful grittiness thrown in. ""Everybody Move It"" is the song that has caught my attention & has seen me humming it all day long for a few weeks now. Many of the other songs are equally well-written and catchy. A high-quality album.Unfortunately the CD is only available as a UK import at the moment, with the domestic US release due in Feb 2006. Still, well worth the higher price."
4,A Special Way...,"Like others before me, I was lead to Ted due, in part, to his lineage. But Teddy is his own man, despite guest appearances by his famed parents. While his dad's guitar work can be felt on an odd cut, you don't think of this as an album by the son of Richard Thompson or Linda Thompson..I found every song to be linkable, some like ""Altered State"", and the LP closer ""Front Lines"" jumped out at me more, base don the pure grace of the melody and stronger lyrics, but there are songs, both soft and raucous that fill this CD release with splendor..I have a couple of other things by TT, but will search out all of his albums based on this strong set of tunes. He presents thoughtful words with an emotive voice. His mum joins him on the (hiden track), as they cover a lesser known Everly Brothers chestnut ..This CD is a winner for start to finish."
4,TEDDY THOMPSON,"TEDDY THOMPSON IS A GREAT SINGER,HEARD A COUPLE SONGS ON THE INTERNET BY HIM AND BOUGHT THIS CD."
3,Good singer,Mr Thompson latest release has some awesome songs that stand out with his voice sound awesome & awesome arrangements & awesome musicianship & they are songs 2&4 & 6-8. The rest of the songs feel out of place that just not the right material for his voice & there just fair to so so. So id pass this CD up & wait til the next cd he puts out is different with more songs that would suite his voice that would be awesome.
5,a great 2nd album,"I first encountered Teddy Thompson in the Leonard Cohen tribute show, Came So Far For Beauty, and immediately ordered his first album, which I found a tad disappointing.However, Separate Way shows all the fine singing and energy that I'd seen on stage. Thompson (like his collaborators on the first track, Martha and Rufus Wainwright) is proof that there is a new generation of singer songwriters with a real flair for songwriting and whose singing serves the song rather than just the singer's ego."
5,Diane is the best author!,"This is one book you shouldn't pass up. It keeps you guessing and it's so hard to know who did all the things at the exclusive sorority. Is it Maxie's friend, but non sister? Is it the sorority president? Or is it one of the girls that didn't make it in? I can bet you'll never guess who did it. In fact, all of Diane Hoh's horror books(the Nightmare Hall series) have incredible twists and even though I've read many books, out of the thirteen I've read of Nightmare Hall, I've guessed correct in zero. It's so hard to guess, and the endings are suspensful and a surprise."
2,Too many jokes,"From what little I could get though of this book, it looks like there should be some good technical information in this book which is why I am giving it two stars instead of one.The problem is there is just way too many jokes in this book for me, to the point it's very annoying. I mean literally nearly ever sentence contains a joke.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a stick in the mud and I enjoy humor, but this is just way over the top. It really makes the book hard to read and follow the topics.Unless you like this over the top style of writing, I would look for another book on Xcode."
3,"Good Info, but Annoying Style","I haven't finished the book yet, but I have to say, if they would just stop inserting supposedly homorous asides every third sentence (one of those cases where they think they're funny, but they're not), this book would move a lot quicker, and I would learn more because I wouldn't be constantly distracted by something I thought was going to be useful information, only to realize it was something I should have ignored.Humorous example projects and explanations using odd names and unique problems can be fun and memorable, but using tired, corny and just plain dumb jokes for the sake of seeing them clutter up the page is not only insipid, but annoying to those who put their brains in ""learn mode"" to get information, only to be distracted by ""jokes"" that add no value whatsoever.That said, the book is definitely informative when it comes to the Xcode toolset-- if only there wasn't so much fat to ignore to get at the meat."
2,Xcode for the Easily Amused,"While this book does have several useful bits of information, finding them requires a torturous slog through some of the worst ""technical"" writing I have come across. The authors of this book seem to think of themselves as brilliant commedians, wasting no opportunity to interject a ""witty"" aside. It is a rare paragraph that doesn't suffer from these distractions, making for a very frustrating reading experience if you're just trying to learn something about the topic ostensibly under discussion. The authors also have a fondness for throwing completely unrelated material into the mix in the form of dozens of call-out boxes that, when combined with the liberal use of oversized screenshots, breaks every page up into a patchwork grid of text, images, and call-outs. I cannot recommend this book to anyone serious about learning and understanding Xcode 2."
2,Not a Programmers book at all,"I usually have good judgement when getting technical books. I was wrong with this one. This book will not help an existing programmer get familiar with X-Code, and won't help a novice get started. The main reason? It is full of garbage anecdote's that just distract the user and interrupt the flow of trying to learn something. The book is horrible on explaining the X-Code IDE and in explaining any Objective C or Cocoa references. Do Not waster your money."
3,I feel ashamed for the authors and the editors.,"This book has probably the most aggravating style I've ever read. HORRIBLE DORKY COMMENTS are liberally sprinkled all throughout the book. It's distracting because I'm now on the defensive for these embarrassing comments such that if I suspect an embarrassing comment is imminent, I skip ahead, hopefully not missing any relevant data. How could the editors tolerate this? Jeez, horrible, simply horrible.The info is good enough; you just have to hold your nose while reading. Thanks for killing the extra trees needed to accomodate those dumb quips."
2,This Book Needs a Laugh Track,"Between the lame wisecracks and puns, there seemed to be some useful information. I don't know if it adds up to a book's worth. Much of the information provided seemed to be the kind of stuff you'd simply learn by doing.If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent the money on a Cocoa programming book. As it turned out, the bad jokes got to be too much and I had to set the book aside. This book is just too affected."
2,Comedy vs. Code,"I appreciate the attempt to inject some comedy into what could seemingly be a dry book on programming, BUT it really made this book very awkward and difficult. I spent alot of time trying sifting through the text to find the gems of information that I needed to know on using Xcode. I wished there were more examples of learning by doing.You try to skim over the comedy but at the same time, you fear you may have missed some important fact since both are intertwined in their writing style."
4,great to start out with,"I'm just starting to learn how to use xcode and programming languages in general, and I think this book is a great tool for those of us who have no freaking clue as to what's going on when it comes to xcode."
1,Annoying with little return.,"Straight up this book is nearly impossible to read. It is more focused on impressing itself with it's chatter and giving very little depth on the topic. In particular Interface Builder, which is crucial to understanding how to do more with less in in the Xcode package, is given casual attention. If the gab were eliminated from this book it would be at least half the size, and more useful. I wish I could get my money back. Very disappointing."
1,"Too much silly banter, not enough real substance","This book is written in a very casual, supposedly ""Mac"" style. The first few ""humerous"" witicisms are amusing, but after a while they really begin to irritate. I found myself wanting to scream ""just get to the point - stop with the cutsie stuff"". It was hard to get to the information I needed.I just couldn't finish the book. I then bought ""Beginning XCode"" by James Bucanek. Much more meat and real information, without the silly banter."
1,Trashcan Material,This is probably the worst so-called technical book that I have read in a long time. There wasn't a single useful piece of information in the whole book. Add to that the fact that the authors think they are funny ( they're not) and consequently fill the pages with pathetic puns not worthy of a 4 year old. I would avoid this book like the plague. I've already dumped my copy in the trashcan
3,Not funny,"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the attempt at humor is distracting. Otherwise, this book does a good job of going through many aspects of XCode 2. I wish that there were more tutorials/examples though, but this is not a book about programming."
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought this book hoping it would provide at least a beginner's step into Xcode programming. Although the authors did warn at the very beginning their purpose was not to teach code, I still assumed it would show me the basics of designing my own application. The first chapter went through the procedure of creating and simple ""Hello World!"" app.I spent the next six chapters hoping we'd eventually get back to making a program. I was disappointed.This book isn't going to teach you a thing. In fact, if you're only out to glean information about Mac coding, you still won't remember anything. It's far too much information given in the wrong format to do anyone any good.Stay away from this book if at all possible. Check elsewhere for Xcode tutorials."
5,Loaded With Climactic Orchestra,"When this CD first starts it is titanic style and takes off over sweeping cliffs to great heights and back down through the trees again. I don't know much about this artist, but gather he must contribute to soundtracks in movies because his music is inspiring and will take you to places far beyond where you are currently sitting.I have died and gone to 'soaring over california' territory!!Thank you, nice work."
2,Viewpoint on the Mass by a priest,"While Fr. McGloin is a priest (therefore deserving of respect), he does not respect the laity. Generally his views of them exhibit sarcasm (as when he refers to one of them as the ""parish mystic"".) The artwork supports this view. However, to be fair, priests get a little hazed, as well. Probably, he was just trying to be funny. My intention in getting this book was to learn more about the Mass. Instead, I just got offended. I can't tell you if this is a good book to learn about the Mass, but if you like his sense of humor, then it may be worth the price."
5,Inspired,"Buck plays inspired guitar. Hints of Spanish and Mideast melodies can be heard as well as true heavy metal. His technical ability is unsurpassed, and because of his apparent broad knowledge of all types of music, this CD should be of interest to more that just the heavy metal listener. Highly recommended."
3,misguided talent,Kevin is an immensly talented guitar player.But his vocals are finger nails on a blackboard.If only he would keep his mouth shut. His on stage rantings are filled with foul language and is not apprpriate to the show. However he is blessed with a great supporting team. The bass player lays down some heavy and intricate lines on a seldom seen six string.And the drummer could probably steal the thunder in the blink of an eye.Having seen them live the drummer is very animated and puts on a great show in his own right. While the bassist seems more subdued his presence is unmistakable.Mr. Buck needs to realize his limitations and just play guitar. He has a great shower voice.Leave it there.All in all it is a tight group who blend well and are worth a cover charge and a few drinks.The disc is well worth the used price but 15 bucks is a bit steep.
5,All the elements are there...,"for a solid, thoughtful portrayal of a family suffering after the father deserts them. I especially liked that the protaganist was a boy, and while a middle chld, he held his two sisters together and proved to be the ""rock' their father never could be. This is sensitive book and would be a great discussion book for middle schoolers. It sensitively explores issues without being ""preachy.""Like the delicate fawn in the damaged wicker basket, Smokey in the destroyed barn, and the destitute family themselves, the theme of perseverence cuts deeply through this novel. I liked this book immensely, and as an 8th grade teacher find it very ""teachable"" from a literary standpoint."
4,horse's drama,No Small Thing is a really great book! The way Natale Ghent describes her characters is really good. I would not recommend it for 10 years or under. I'm 11 and I thought it had too much boyfriend/girlfriend stuff. But altogether it is realy good.
1,Don't buy this book!,"With all due respect to the author, this book is a joke. It's like reading a children's book. The book is bound like a children's book, the print is really large, has alot of pictures and the text is remedial. There are 64 pages total, but if it was written for an adult, it would probably condense down to 10. Not worth the money I paid for it!"
5,Great Read in understanding some rituals,"This book is for people who are interested in different tribes and their rituals on becoming peaceful inside and how they coped through their stress; and stress they had as white eyes came and took over their land. It first goes into 4 different tribes and how they worked and lived, then into some of their ceremonies. Finally at the end how you can apply these ceremonies to yourself in modern day ways. They show good examples on how to make certain ceremony items that are needed and give many suggestions on how to work a ceremony for these days."
1,not as 'horrific' as I thought it would be... over hyped....,"Unfortunately the 'sales' pitch for this book from the publisher's website, pretty much gives away all the good stories, so nothing is surprising when you read it. Which is of course disappointing. It's filled with short stories - what is interesting is that a couple of the writers are quite well known in their field now.It's easy to read and would be nice to give to someone as long as they know nothing about the stories (haven't been to the publishers website).Overall I only found one of the stories outrageous."
4,Good stuff but be careful with it!,"The tea is delicious. It is very smooth, and very fragrant but you have to be careful in the brewing. I tend to make my tea a little stronger than most, and this tea becomes very bitter if you leave it in longer than the recommended 2-3 minutes. I have also had some bags tear on me, leading to a few humorous gag reflexes and cursing over the sink while I clean out my flask. If you can stand to pay attention to it, it is highly recommended."
5,~ A Enjoyable Love Story ~,"This is the first book by Lisa Higdon I have read, and let me tell you I enjoyed this book so much, I loved all the characters in this book, Well not uncle Will, he was such a jerk, as I was reading along I kept hoping that uncle Will would get what he deserved. I loved the way Caitlin loved Cole, and how Cole loved her, I thought there son Jamie was so cute, it was an enjoyable love story that I will remember for years to come.Happy Reading Lisa"
1,"Horrible shirt, don't buy...","This is a horrible shirt, don't buy it, it arrived late, and with a stain, its just an iron on shirt, bad quality, and shrinks alot when washed, i was very irritated to find just this shirt in an envelope with a stain on it. Bad customer service."
3,Pretty,"I bought this for my 3 year old as her ""potty training prize"". She is ""princess"" in the brain, and it worked. It is very pretty. I paid $19 for it and now I notice it is less."
1,"Inexpensive, but definately not worth it","Not particularly funny. For some reason, CC didn't use the great clips from Lewis Black, Jon Stewart, and many others that they have available, and instead included endless weird cartoons and lame spoofs. What a waste of $5.89."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this CD. The music is not even vaguely authentic; it sounds much more like a modernistic ""elevator music"" imitation of real beladi music. As a dancer, I would be completely unable to use this album for a performance, since the pieces are much too ""zingy"" and cutesy to use. If I could return it, I would."
2,Stinky Litter,"Well, I bought this after reading reviews of ""natural"" litter.I used this for a month, and sadly, it doesn't hold up.I had to scoop the box twice a day (2 cats) in order to keep the smell to a minimum. It does nothing to absorb ammonia odors.. so part of the house began to smell like wet corn and ammonia.. yuk!Does not clump well at all.. I really wanted this to do the trick because I don't want to go back to conventional litter.. but I don't want to spend one more night smelling the litter while I am watching tv after a long day at work!! (again, thats with TWO cleanings a day!)..Natures' Miracle has some revising to do.."
2,Marijuana Beer:,Very disappointing. More a book for beginning brewers than it is making marijuana beer. I can thing of better ways of extracting the compounds than the simple methods shown.
1,"Next time, hire an editor","I started using this book but switched to the Kaplan and GMAC guides because of the number of editing mistakes I encountered in using this book. Nothing undermines my confidence more than a book that dispenses wrong answers, so for that reason I gave it one star. Save your money - go with the Kaplan guides instead."
3,Useful Too in GMAT Prep,I did not want to spend the money for a Kaplan or Princeton review class. 30 Days provided the base for successful GMAT prep.
2,Poor Editing .Full of printing errors in the practice tests,Poor Editing. Full of printing errors in the practice tests
4,Good Book - Errors are frustrating,"Wish to know if there is a way to contact the author and ask if the errors (which seem obvious), are really errors. This may be a misinterpreted issue, but in most cases the error is hopefully in the book. These books should all have an email address to communicate with the author, to both help the author on the next issue and help the user resolve real issues."
5,something different,"I got this as a present and I fell in love with it. I get compliments everytime I wear. If you are looking for a different perfume, then this is the one for you. It reminds me of something the rich would wear in ancient times. Very rich and full bodied."
1,ewww...,"Shipping and packaging I have no complaints of,however it doesn't have a cap as shown in the photo.It smells gross, mostly like flowers(but not a good flower)with a bit of incense.This scent smells like some other perfume that I cant place at the moment (some funky old scent you get from drugstore or avon).ugh its gross wish i could send it back."
3,Not That I'm Against Canada....,"Do you ever do that approach/avoidance thingie? Where you run up to something and at the last minute veer away? This book/author and I had been doing that dance for months for no good reason. I heard nothing but positives on this series. I'm very well read in this genre. But everytime I picked up this book I would look through it, put it down and choose something else to read. So I finally read it. Very well written, tons of good characters, great settings--but--meah. What I didn't like was the idea of the last and only female were. I didn't like the sneaky way she became a shifter. I didn't like the obsessive nature of the romance where only negative elements occured because of love. Not a recommend from me, but everyone else likes it so I'm just on the outside with this one."
2,Bitten=Meh,"Why Bitten doesn't live up to the hype:Elena: you can throw the words strong willed as many times as you like, but that's never going to change the meaning. Badarse does not equate strong willed. While I will admit that I would certainly not pick a fight with her, her will is easier to snap than a toothpick.Also the characters are pretty bland, they don't stand out well and are easily forgettable.Armstrong is a pretty good writer if you like the way she goes about it(and it much, much higher in quality when compared to a certain S. Meyer), unfortunately she's just not very good with characters, story, and maintaining the suspension of disbelief.This isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's an okay read if you're into guilty pleasures and pure enetertainment."
3,OK but nothing exceptional (or new),"This was an OK read. I just don't understand writers who want to have a strong female protagonist but make her a girl instead of a woman. She wants to be treated just like the guys and even plays the ""mine's bigger than yours"" games. Then she acts like a spoiled teeny-bopper when someone says or does something she doesn't like - and never seems to ""get it"".The male characters are much more believable and likable - hence the three stars. I'll try one more in the series to see if things improve."
2,Weak copy of tired plot,"""Moon Called,"" by Patricia Briggs is not only more or less the same story, it's 100 times better.""Bitten,"" lacks good character development. It also lacks a solid reason for the main characters to be fighting. They fight because the author wrote it that way. The way she was bitten was also very weak. Who talks back to their boyfriend's father in his own house about his own dog?Sorry I bought it, will be selling it back soon."
3,Only existing female werewolf!!! Her life has to be Exciting!!!,"paperback was Christmas gift. I enjoyed it the whole 3 days it took to read! Elena is the only female werewolve in the world. that is just the beginning of how the history and rules are written for these gorgeous wolves right down to their diets & love life's. a good back story fills out each character which is well developed. I could have used a bit more development on the villains but they were bad enough to hold my interest. the underlying current of the love story kept me going but one characters indecision frustrated me! after All, when you have two great lovers to choose between, one must always take their time. buy this book & start your adventure thru a world filled with,murder mystery, crime solving & the closely guarded secrets of the world of the werewolves."
5,I love this series,"I love this series, the first two books really start it out with a bang, This couples story is my favorite. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the paranormal."
1,In a word....BORING!,I bought this book mainly because I love the Anita Blake books and thought this would be a good series to start reading. Wow was I ever wrong. The book took me forever to get through. I found it tedious and very boring. It was very difficult to actually like and empathize with the main character Elena. Just read the other one star reviews already written and posted about Bitten. They say it all and I agree with every one of them. Do not waste your money buying this book.
3,could have been better,"I thought this book was well written , and the characters were great, but, I found the story line to be a bit slow. I found myself getting bored with this book about half way in. Same old, same old, seem to be how the story was progressing.Could have had more of a story going besides chasing down mutts. I am going to try out the Anita Blake series, and a few others I have read about on this site and give them a try. I hope they pack a little more of a punch than this book did."
2,Boring,"**SPOLIER** Wow, this book is sooo long. I think it may be because it dragged on forever! There was no point to this book! It went in circles over and over again! And Elena is such a sl*t!. I can't help it. How could she do that to both Philips and Clay. And serious? How could Clay even still want her? She so annoying! The whole book was pointless. I don't understand why she went back to her home town JUST to go back back home... And why home?? Why would she want to take the evil back home where it can find Phillips, too? And why would they think that the evil won't follow her back there? Wouldn't it be the first place they look for her? DO NOT READ THIS BOOK unless you need it to sleep. Nothing happens until the VERY END. THERE'S NO ROMANCE at all if you're looking for something that will make your heart beat. This one will only pist you off."
3,A different look at werewolves,"I actually read this book out of order in the series, third in order instead of first. I think they skewed my feel for this book, because I missed the different characters in the third and fourth books.I enjoyed it, it was well-written, but I did find it a bit disturbing how easily they had the heroine have sex with the werewolf that bit her. Also the way it was acceptable to kill anyone who might threaten the pack, even by simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.That being said, I tried to put myself in the mindset of the characters, to see their point of view. You felt their pain, all of them seemed to have an issue in the past, the writing is very evocative. I simply enjoyed later volumes better."
3,"Great read, very intense",This was suggested on my amazon recomendations. The mystery was wonderfully creative and the had me suprised when I would read the characters thoughts and reasons behind what they were doing. The love story with Clay was mesmerizing and adictive it kept me reading all the way through.
5,"Two thumbs, and paws, up for Kelly Armstrong's first book","""Bitten"" is a wonderful re-telling of the old werewolf tale. Kelly Armstrong brings Elena (who is telling the story) to life, as well as the other characters. Elena is one of the only female werewolves out there, bitten by her intended -Clayton- and turned. Elena, however, doesn't like being a werewolf so she leaves The Pack and moves to Canada, where she finds a normal life and a normal boyfriend. However, when The Pack's leader, Jermey, calls on Elena to return home, Elena knows she has no choice. However, Elena tries not to fall back into the life she once knew, of The Pack, and tries to resist Clay's attempts to woo back her love. However, when Clay is taken captive by a rouge band of Mutts (werewolves outside The Pack), Elena must make her choice.Kelly Armstrong is a GREAT writer and creates characters you actually care about. It's a ""howling"" (bad werewolf humor) good read."
4,good but not great,I've found all of Kelley Armstrong's books a little slow out of the starting gate - they don't grab me until about page 100 but once they grab you can't put them down easily. I wasn't too happy about the occasional graphic sex scene but it wasn't enough to make me stop reading all together. The book was good enough that I do look forward to reading the other books in the series.
4,My first Kelley Armstrong experience,"I enjoyed being ""Bitten"" by this story of ""family"" and love. Again, it just proves it doesn't matter whether you are born or ""adopted"", love will find a way. Yes, this one is a little different, but I liked it very much."
1,Incredibly slow,"Kelley Armstrong has a good grasp of what she wants to do with werewolf emotions and doubts. In that, she is innovative and skillful. Unfortunately, she has a very hard time of fitting it into a believable, hermetic plot. There is no real pace, the rules and motivations are all jumbled and change from scene to scene. If you want a sappy werewolf love story with gratuitous sex then read it by all means. If you're interested in a good, pacy story, well... Run for you lives."
1,Is it just me? I thought it was horrible?,"This book was so boring and akwardly written, I quit about three chapters in. For one thing, the prologue was written not only in first person, but in first person PRESENT, which is very offputting. The main story itself is told in first person, and not well. The main character comes across as completely self-centered and whining. I had no interest in her or her problems. I felt no connection with the story at all and finally gave up. Perhaps die-hard werewolf fans will like it, but I couldn't stand toturing myself any more than absolutely neccesary."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"The canadian editoral reads, ""she agonizes over ordinary girl stuff .."" Yes. Well, she agonizes over everything. Except cheating on her boyfriend. She just forgets about that. When she's not agonizing over something she's arguing, being stubborn, knows better than everybody or having a panic attack. I could not like this charater. I tried. I even skipped over the sex scenes. I liked the premise but I could not sympathize, empathize or respect the protagonist."
5,a great werewolf heroine,"An edgy, somewhat bitter werewolf heroine; the gorgeous antisocial werewolf who turned her, that she can't forgive. Now there's a romance that you think can never take off! Watching these two warily circle around each other throughout the book is delightful. The murder they are trying to solve is interesting but it is the relationship between these two which is the heart of the book."
2,"Difficult Read, Difficult Heroine","A disappointing and hard read. The author's attempt to portray the heroine as a strong woman only came across as an unlikable self righteous, bratty bitch. It was a fairly straightforward simple plot, no twists, turns or surprises, you knew who the bad guys were and that was about it. Various characters show up and are killed before you even have a chance to care. Others were fairly one note and very bland by the time their turn comes around you still don't care. I had to force myself to finish and it couldn't happen soon enough, lots of pages wasted on uninteresting boring information that leads nowhere most times. The ending picked up a bit but overall, left much to be desired."
4,Good but it made me sad,"(to other aspiring writers)Do you ever have a moment your life when you have an idea and you think ""wow I'm so original for thinking this! My book will be amazing!"" Then you read something by someone else who had the exact same idea but what published before you? Yea. That's how Bitten was for me. I enjoyed the read but it kept me up at night wondering how to change my own novel. Her unique element is that the werewolves actually turn into wolves instead of some kind of demented human/wolf creature from Ginger Snaps."
1,It took me forever to read this book.,"I kept putting it down and then would pick it up again read a little bit, put it down etc. I kept thinking it's going to get good, but it never did. Ms. Armstrong had a great idea, but the repeats in it went on and on. The character Elena was so fickle I couldn't belive it. Jeremy was a good guy but why? Overall, the movement of the book was slow, I got tired of hearing no, no, no and meaning maybe. Elena's age must be about 28, but you would think it was 14. Overall I didn't like it."
4,Bitten,"I wasn't totally blown away by Bitten, but it was enjoyable. It's the kind of book I would only read in my free time. Half mystery novel, half romance novel. Predictable. The dialogue was a bit sketchy sometimes, mostly because it was used to explain details that either didn't need blatant explanations, or it included things that would have been better said within the story. I think what saved it was the premise and interesting werewolves.There were a lot of sex and ""changing"" scenes. I almost quit halfway through after about the third time the main characters changed, werewolf flirted/rough-housed, ran in the woods, tore meat apart, and sometimes had sex. I probably won't read the rest of the series, but I wouldn't rule it out on a rainy day."
4,Very good start to a new novel,"After reading the summary I decided to try this book out, and with a price of only 4.00 I didn't have much to lose if I didn't like it. I am glad that I took the chance becauseBitten: A Novel (The Otherworld)is a great book. The characters are real and likable. There are a few parts that lag a bit, but overall it is a good read to pass the weekend away. The main problem I had with the book was the inconsistencies wen she was in Stonehaven in regards to her interaction with Clay and how she doesn't seem to have the best moral character in regards to who she might be sleeping with when she sleeps with someone else."
2,Juvenile and Disappointing,"Kudos to the reviewer who mentioned that this author mostly ""tells"" rather than ""shows"". But rather than having to read the whole book you can sum it up thusly: werewolves like to run. A lot. I mean a whole lot. They like to eat a lot. And sloppily. And drink water. They like to howl. (So far this sounds like my dog.) There is only one female werewolf so while she and her mate (who everyone can see from the beginning she is passionate about and is really quite bored with the milqtoast human she has cursory involvement with.) have sex, I'm not sure what the others do...except maybe fight over her. So, there you have it."
2,"A dull, thinly veiled ""Mary-Sue"" romp","I seem to be in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the ""only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf"" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future."
2,not the best.,wasn't the greatest book i've ever read. it was kind of overly drawn out and was way too long.
4,Warning ! Later readers's comments contain SPOILERS !,"Enjoyable book! Modern, independent sort of female protagonist. Great for those of us who love those sexy werewolf and vampire tales."
3,"It's okay, but....(spoilers)","I read this book based on the reviews here, but afterwards I felt like I had been cheated. While the basic premise is interesting, there are several ""hoary old cliches"" that bring this down, For example:- all the Pack members look as if they stepped off of the cover of GQ, while the ""mutts"" were all described as less than perfect;- all foster families were were dysfunctional with the males interested in sex with the protagonist while their wives looked the other way;- the courts would not allow a single woman to adopt, no matter what;In addition, the subplots were thin, with one glaring example being a wedding ring worn by a major character not being noticed or questions by a character supposedly trying to make any kind of conversation."
3,Good Romance,"I was expecting a horror novel, but this is more of a romantic fantasy. I don't understand why she's the only female werewolf in the world. It was a good read so I suspended my disbelief."
2,Unforgetable,"Life hasn't turned out the way Elena planed. In this fast paced novel by Kelley Armstrong, Elena believed she just wanted a simple, normal life. As we all know, nothing is ever that simple. Her live-in boyfriend and his family are giving her the normal life she craves, but they don't know she is a werewolf. Then an urgent call sends Elena hurrying back to the pack she has tried to seperate herself from and the love of her life.The danger, action and romance will draw you quickly into this preternatural reality. Bitten will keep you reading through the night. Buy this book."
4,Strong First Novel in Paranormal Romance Genre,"While I am sure I am not the target demographic for this book, I have to confess that I found it to be a strong entry in the paranormal romance field, with a fresh take on werewolf society, complex and interesting main characters, and vivid narrative description. That this is a first novel makes it even more impressive; I am not surprised at all that Kelley Armstrong has had a number of additional works published and developed a strong following. The only thing that keeps this from a five star rating is that the minor characters are less well differentiated and some of the tactical decisions in the encounters between the Pack and the Mutts are not too smart. Still, those are minor concerns in an original, gripping take on werewolves in modern society and the passion that surrounds their lives and their loves. Donald J. Bingle, author of Forced Conversion."
4,Well written and entertaining for a book about wherewolves,"Eana is a young attractive woman who just wants to live a normal life. The problem is that ten years ago a werewolf, who just happened to be her fiancée, bit her. This of course made her a werewolf. The only female werewolf alive. She has left her wolf family, the pack, and is now trying to settle down and live a normal life. Unfortunately, she still has all the werewolf needs, like the need to eat enormous amounts of food.When the pack leader calls her to return to the pack, she is forced to confront her inner demons, or should I say, inner werewolf. She is also forced to deal with her ex who is still in love with her.The plots is a mixture of love story, and also thriller as Elana and her pack hunt down and try to stop killings of the pack members.I enjoyed every part of this book. Thankfully it was all relatively logical, considering the subject. Without a doubt the writer is a gifted writer and made the werewolves seem real."
5,A Fantastic Read for the Horror Starved,"I thank my lucky stars that I managed to come across this novel, because it is by far the best series i have come across since Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Full of mystery and action, Bitten is a fanatastic novel that holds you until the very last page, and leaves you wishing for more.If you're tired of the Anita Blake approach to the supernatural world, where everyone seems to sleep with everyone else, then try Kelley's Women of the Otherworld. There's still a little sex, but the story isn't ruled by it.I would recommend this novel to anyone, and those that have read it at my request have been pleasantly surprised."
3,Not entirely escapist,"This review pertains to the whole series, rather than solely to Bitten.Pros:* Good writing* Likeable characters* Generally well-plottedCons:* Every book has at least one attempted rape, or rape theme (Haunted has a particularly awful scene featuring a raped pre-teen begging for her mother--that's not the kind of thing I read for entertainment. That scene actually stayed with me for a couple of weeks, and led me to stop reading the series. On the other hand, I suppose it was vividly written.)* Pretty gory--if you like horror it probably won't bother you. It got to be too much for me.Depends on your point of view:* Lengthy, detailed sex scenes (these might have been more fun to read if I hadn't usually been trying to rock my baby to sleep at the same time).* Not very much humor. The books take themselves pretty seriously."
3,Okay Maybe 3 1/2 stars,"Good story, good plot, and over all good characters. I would have liked more out of this first book because I really enjoyed it. The book left me with a feeling of wanting more information.It's one of those books like but don't know why."
3,"Not what I anticipated, but not bad","First let me preface by saying that almost all books have to live up to the Anita Blake standard. That said, this one wasn't bad. There are some interesting politics here, with one lone female werewolf involved with nothing but men. I did think this moved a bit slowly though. Over all, a nice offering. I'm not in a rush to read the second."
3,Bitten (Women of the Otherworld),"Good reading. Not as exciting as other Paranormal/Romance books I have recently read, but still a good reading book."
3,Just an OK book,"I must admit that I was quite disappointed with this book.The writing was ok but not more than that and a page-turner it is certainly not.What does make this book reach the OK mark is that the author does a good job of making a believable character out of the werewolf Elena. One can easily belief that a werewolf could operate in modern society and everything that happens in the story is very real and believable.Bitten is a book that I could easily put down, not to be picked up again until maybe days or a few weeks had passed.I guess the fault partly lies with me, I had expected an exciting tale and this is more of a drama."
3,a diverting read,"Elena Michaels is just trying to fit in and lead a normal life. But that's kinda tough when you're a werewolf. She's living with her unsuspecting boyfriend when she gets a call from the Pack. What follows reads like a hard-boiled detective story complete with a romantic angle, wild sex, and plenty of gore. There aren't many werewolves in the world but it turns out that what's left of them are feuding. Elena gets caught up in all of it and she's a prize of sorts because she's the only female werewolf. This was a diverting read and the pages turned easily. The sex scenes were kinda fun too. (See page 87 for the first one). I've also heard that this book has been optioned as a movie which may star Angelina Jolie (I could see that). But looks-wise, I pictured Elena more like a younger Sigourney Weaver. This book is the first in a series featuring Elena and would probably appeal to anyone who's O.D.'d on Anne Rice's books."
1,Not Impressed,"I bought and read this book ""Bitten"". I was so impressed by all the previous reviews that I bought ""Bitten"", ""Stolen"", and ""Dime Store Magic"" all at the same time. I don't have much to say favorable about ""Bitten"". I was so unimpressed and bored by it that I read all of it except the last twenty pages. By that time I was so disgusted that I didn't care how the book ended. I have subsequently thrown all three books into the trash, the latter two books were new and unread. Sorry, but I found it unimaginative, verbose, redundant, and yes boring."
4,Really Good. Can't wait for another!,"Definitely worth reading. I liked the strong main characters and the interaction between them. It made me want to be a werewolf just so I could live with the pack. It's a modern werewolf story that I think Laurel Hamilton (Anita Blake) fans will enjoy. Lot's of fun, but too short. I polished it off in less than 48 hours over Thanksgiving. Please write more Ms. Armstrong!"
1,"Silly, unlikable people do stupid things.","This book is one of the most infuriating books I've ever finished. Firstly, the characters are flat and unlikable. Secondly, they're dumb. We are told repeatedly that some of them are smart, but they do INSIPIDLY stupid things. For example, they know that someone nearby is trying to kill them, yet they all go to bed at the same time. Brilliant. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it has saved me from reading anything else by the same author."
2,Unsympathetic character,"I've enjoyed many of Kelley Armstrongs books, but I was very disappointed in this one. Elena the only female werewolf in existence, has almost no redeeming qualities. Her character is betrayed in the worst way imaginable, her whole future ""stolen"" from her. But she loves the guy anyway. She says `NO' at every opportunity to the guy, but then immediately drops her pants.She lives with Philip, a not well drawn character. Her whole life with him is a lie. Then when she betrays him in almost every way, she says, ""well, he would never of excepted me anyway"". I don't mind flaws in a character, but here, your rooting for the other guy.Her writing style is good, but I could not find this character believable."
2,2.5 stars,"I was hoping this book would be a gem, but it was mediocre. Too much blah blah blah and sex, not enough wolves."
4,Not your typical werewolf story,"I had read reviews on this book, so decided to give the series a try. Glad I did, and will go on to ""Stolen"". The main character is Elena, the only female werewolf in the world. In fact, there are only 35 werewolves. Right there, you know this book is going to be different. She really isn't happy about being a were, and tries to escape that world, but the ties are there, and she returns. The world has a vicious side, and don't get too attached to the characters, cause they do get killed. It's a dark look, at the Otherworld, and makes for a more realistic story. Of course, it is a fantasy, so not all that believeable, but I like the darkness to it. Not just another paranormal love story, with a predictable ending."
4,A very good read,A very interesting book. It kept you wanting to know what happens next. It was a completely different type of book for me and I found it liked it.
3,Bitten Audiobook,"Interesting story, a new werewolf series. Very Slow in parts... I actually fast forwarded thru sections, even though I love audiobooks.Also, this is one of the dumber more stubborn heroines. She does things her gut tells her not to... wants to go back to a guy she has nothing to talk to about. I'd like a smarter heroine. Get on a plane vs running your feet off, etc. Live in the now vs the past. Extra Drama not needed for the storyline."
4,Exciting series!,"It's hard for a book to keep me entertained. Probably because so many of them sound alike or are so predictable. However, Bitten is an excellent book. The character Elena is the girl next door that can kick butt and has a sense of humor!"
2,Really?,I got more than half way through the book before I realized that there was nothing to the story or characters. It's fast paced and sort of interesting because of the subject matter but I found it a waste of my time.
4,Glad I was wrong,"A friend told me to read this, knowing that I'm not into the whole werewolf thing. But to my surprise I really enjoyed this book. Yes, I can say there was some corny parts but what werewolf story doesn't have those. This book kepted my interest, wanting to know what happened next. I will definitly read more of her work."
4,A jolly good read.,When you are in the mood for a fast and entertaining read this book will fill the bill.
1,Completely Useless!!!,"Looking at moving from a 355 to 360 so thought I would be prudent and pick up this buyer's guide. Before buying my 355 I read through a million forum posts on fchat and flife and learned all I needed to look for in buying a 355 (manifolds, bypass valve, fuel lines, etc.). Expecting that a ""Buyer's Guide"" would tell you things like this to look out for on the 360, I read it in complete disbelief. This is little more than a guy who bought one talking about his car and providing a couple useless tips like ""spray water on the car and it should bead up immediately""!!! Seriously? You need to put that in a buyer's guide? How about some detail on how to know the variators are bad or some discussion on the exhaust manifolds rather than whether or not the car has been waxed! He literally says to ""take a look in the engine bay."" For what? Take a look and marvel? That's what I mean by useless info. Don't buy, complete piece of junk."
3,Awful cover-- good formatting,"This is the only compilation of the Jungle Books I could find for the Kindle that had decent formatting and wasn't butchered by a psychotic editor.But couldn't somebody, anybody, put a picture other than a butterfly on the cover?A wolf, a monkey, an elephant, a bear, a tiger.Anything.Hell, even a mongoose or seal would work.Ah, well. Enjoy the book."
1,A fictionalized Pamela Smart story,"Why doesn't this author write a book of her own? Does she have any imagination? Any idiot could take the Pam Smart story and change the names and a few things about the characters. It's a shameless copy of the real story, and Pam Smart should be suing this author!"
5,What a Great Book!!!,"What a Great book!!! It would definitely have to be among the best I have ever read. It's presented in a fresh, unique way and has great characters. I saw the movie first and it does not do the book justice."
1,This is a novelization of the TV movie!,"Joyce watched the TV movie based on Pamela Smart's antics, which starred Helen Hunt, and basically wrote a novelization of that screenplay. Yuck!"
2,Somewhat disappointed...,"I agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines, that was something like ""just ok, not great."" I've been working w/ Server 2003 for a while now, and from my work experience, I knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage. I would read each chapter, read the summaries, take all the practice questions, and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what I'd face on the exam. Unfortunately, I was right, and I just missed passing the exam. This book isn't terrible, but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also."
5,Chalk another one up for Sybex!,"No single book will enable you to pass any of the Microsoft exams, but I've had the best luck with Sybex. The key is really the CD - it has a copy of the book in PDF (you don't need the CD to run it, you can copy the pdf to a flash drive and carry it with you), and the electronic tests allow you to quickly review all of the chapter exams (200 questions total) plus 100 additional questions. Retaking the exams over and over is what allows you to pinpoint your strong and weak areas. You will need to supplement the text with online resources, but this will be the case for any book. One problem area - the book covers SUS but this is now obsolete so you need to study WSUS. I've used Sybex as my main study guide to obtain my Network+, MCP, MCDST, MCTS, and now I just passed the server exam on my way to MCSA. I also recommend the Microsoft Press book for this exam. I give a thumbs down for the Exam Cram one. Good luck!"
4,Another good one from Sybex,"This book is a very good guide if you are looking to take the 70-290 exam. The topics covered align with what is covered on the exam but as always, you should use several sources when preparing for an exam."
2,I have read better,"Like what was stated earlier, I am an experienced windows system administrator w/ MCP status and this book leaves out some details. I like sybex but this one looks like it might have been rushed. I dont particularly care for the sybex CD's also. The questions were to easy for the actual Microsoft exams. Plus the chapter about optimizing Server 2003 left out some noticable details in how to optimize the page file. Its good for beginners but if you really want to know more and better prepare for this exam, read another book."
1,Wilted,"Listening to this CD is like walking into a great Russian restaurant and ordering the best meal on the menu. The waiter brings out a wilted salad and day old bread.This is a cheap way to get a feel for the three symphonies but if you can afford it, look elsewhere.This is not a DDD recording."
1,oy vey,"as a buyer, and one of the worst photos of me in circulatory existence.I had a heart attack when I was sold this book at work, and still have a heart attack every time I remember that I was once an 18-year old kid with bleached blond hair holding a piece of glass...well...never mind that. It's in the book."
3,Average Noir Fare,"Although I've enjoyed Matheson's other work, this is an early effort and it shows some of the roughness in technique that his later work thankfully lacks. Even as the novel progresses, the style improves. I actually found the plot compelling enough. I got ahead of the story early and thought that the ending was going to be more convoluted than it turned out to be. Overall it's a fun read, and I'd recommend it for Matheson fans or curious noir fans."
1,This lamp will drive you crazy!,"Lamp flickers and had to be returned. On, off, on, off, little flickers, off, glows, on, fast flickers, etc., etc. - it drove us nuts. I've got two other Ott lights (different models) for craft work so I thought this one would be nice to have on the nightstand. Thank goodness Amazon has such a nice return policy."
2,wrong size would not fit in the hole.,The pedals were very nice. But the bolt end was too big to fit where my pedals go. It is just a small bit too big. But won't fit.
4,Good instruction. I learned a lot.,"Much vocabulary was introduced in a relatively short period of time with good review of verb tenses. These tapes helped to increase my listening comprehension as well as my verb conjugation. The downside was that some of the sentences that were supposed to be repeated were way too long to remember (like this one!). These tapes are easily worth the money, but I didn't feel the level of instruction was exactly ""advanced."" If Instant Immersion develops a higher level of Spanish instruction on tapes, I would definitely purchase it also."
2,A good infomercial in a book,"This book is basically an infomercial for TradeOut.com. It does have some useful information, but you are none-too-gently steered in the direction of selling your surplus assets on TradeOut's web site.That's great if you don't want to think about it, but TradeOut has lots of competition, and some of it is just plain better, especially for technology assets.Oh, yeah, you can get the book for free if you register on TradeOut's site."
3,Sound Quality is Terrible,"I tried this dvd for the first time and I like the fact that I worked up a good sweat and got my heart pumping in such a short space of time but the sound quality is awful! It sounds like if someone downloaded off the internet and burnt it on a dvd. Anyway I can't return it as I do not live in the states but only because I am accustommed to aerobic workout, I can catch on quickly without needing to understand what Chalene is saying. I will probably continue to use this dvd but the sound will bother each time especially knowing paid so much for it."
3,great workout,"Although I think the workout is great, it seems the best music is used on the commercial. I was hoping for more of the great music."
3,Pretty Good,This workout video is pretty good if you're short on time. It's basically just cardio. I liked the fact that she doesn't waste time explaining - so you just get right to the workout. This wouldn't be good for someone who isn't used to exercising though.
4,Awesome!!,"I bought this a few months ago, then it just sat on my shelf until today. I loved it! It is very similar to the Fat Blaster DVD which is my favorite Turbo Jam workout. It totally kicked my ass. Now I just need to find a way to afford the whole system. The only reason I gave it 4 out 5 stars is the price. It it supposed to be a free bonus and the packaging is just a cardboard sleeve, but I will still be using it often!"
2,Overpriced for what you get,"I bought this just to see what the turbofire series would be like. For a $23 DVD you would think it would at least come in a plastic case, instead it came in a cheap cardboard sleeve. The actual workout wasn't bad. I am not in great shape by any means. I play tennis a couple times a week and go on a treadmill or bike a couple times a week. I actually did not have difficulty keeping up with the video. The hardest part was learning the moves to keep up. It made me sweat which was good. There is a lot of jumping around so I wouldn't do this if you have knee problems. There is one woman who does the low impact version on stage, but her version looks too easy. You may as well not do this video if you can't do the full version. In any case $23 for 15 minutes of exercise and a 5 minute warm down is not good value when you have have something like Supreme 90 with 10 DVDs for $20."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"Let me just start off by saying that you get completely ripped off on this product. This is basicall a free DVD that you get with another DVD Package (Assume the complete Turbo Fire Set), it says right on the DVD Free 19.99 value. So I don't know how they can be charging 23.99 for the product. If you are just trying to get a feel for the Turbo Fire workout, you better be in somewhat descent shape. Don't expect to put this in your DVD player and hit the ground running, because you won't. You will probably winded after 10 minutes. I plan on sending it back, due to the misrepresnetation of the product by Amazon. Shame on you Amazon."
4,Chalene has done it again!,She knows how to make a workout fun! She has been an inspiration to me for years! I love her energy!
5,More than just an introduction,"This is a classic -- the best, most elegantly presented coverage of Econometric fundamentals I've ever seen. Professor Dhrymes doesn't water down the presentation. This is a rigorous analysis, but it's also remarkably clear. As with any mathematical text, some investment is required to get familiar with the author's style and notation, but once on board, the payoff is tremendous. Dhryme's clarity of thought and artful use of algebric notation can reduce many otherwise Byzantine relationships to the simplicy of ""2 + 2 = 4"".Dhrymes is an authentic master of his craft -- this book offers the chance to learn from the best."
3,good,"Gardner's talent ain't bad. But Gardner himself once said, ""I'm the greatest writer since Chaucer."" Well, Chaucer's books are in print hundreds of years after first appearing. Gardner's books are almost all out of print not long after his death! Poor John Gardner. He so desperately wanted to obtain immortality through his works. His life and ego should be a warning to all those ego-ridden artists who step on other's toes, and ignore their kids, for the sake of their art...Give it up. You ain't going to be immortal either."
3,"Its a text book, but not a bad read.","Not the best book ever, but I had to read it for a class and for that it was not bad."
3,Libs are hilarious,"Have you noticed the number of times that the reviews asked about whether ""Bush has helped you??"" The role of government is not to help us...it is to protect and assure our liberty. Bush has been called an idiot in these reviews a number of times...really the only reason they say that is that his opinions are different that theirs. Bush may not be eloquent in his speech...he may not even be that smart. But, he has true convictions...not all that I believe in mind you...but, they are convictions. I will take that over pure ""intelligence"" any time. He has helped me...by helping limit the government's role in my life. The small cranium ones are those that can't accept other opinions as legitimate. Oh yeah...the book IS funny. I can still laugh!"
5,Having a few laughs on the worst president ever,"I'll make this review short and to the point. Reading the quotes in this book shows what a moron George W. Bush essentially is. It's very funny but it's not at all funny to realize that such a cretin is the most powerful man in the world. Although he tries hard to not make such glaring mistakes in his public speaking these days, he has proven his inborn stupidity by racking up an astronomical federal deficit and mismanaging the most useless war America has ever been involved in. Most of the content of this short book is from 2000 but it was certainly a warning of things to come if enough people were stupid enough to vote for this stupid man. Of course, the 2000 election was stolen but if it hadn't been so close, the hijacking of the presidency couldn't have happened. However, stupidity reigns in America so just read this book and have a good laugh. The joke's on us all."
3,Painful,"Dan Quayle must be loving every moment. Quayle's verbal flubs seem minor in comparison to this tome packed with Bush's rather strange commentary on the issues.Personally I found it personally painful to read, seeing the struggles our president has with simple english sentence structure. I did laugh, but then again it gave me lots of insight on what Americans really want in a president. It certainly isn't intellectualism."
5,See....anyone CAN be president!,"Our 43rd president contributes much to laugh about to the political arena. But, then again, don't most politicians? The difference here is that seldom are the laughable aspects of any one person (except for Dan Quayle) attributed to faulty speech patterns! This collection will amaze you, and astound you. It is imperceivable that one human being can speak so ineptly. And to think that this man represents us in fragile areas of foreign diplomacy and international trade. See, your second grade teacher was right! Anyone CAN be president!"
5,Bush with his foot in his mouth,"All I can say is if you are a follower of ""W"" and his policies, don't read this book. It portrays Bush is somewhat stupid and, certainly, semi-literate."
5,Hilarious and shocking,"I knew George W. was a poor speaker, but I didn't realize just how poor until I read the examples in this book. This book is funny, a very quick read, and worth the time."
4,Republicans: Wake Up,"I challenge the republican masses to take a close look at the man and his policies. What has he done to make the average republican's life better? A couple hundred bucks back from Uncle Sam? Thanks to Mr. Bush, more people around the world than ever before hate our guts. Do you really think we are winning the war on terror? Our chances of being blown up at the local Laundromat are increasing exponentially. Bushisms is pure Bush. Any time we hear his ""genius"" we are really hearing a ""Roveism"". George W. Bush is a great leader the way O.J. Simpson is a great role model. Wake up. You want a great republican, try chanting: I LIKE IKE. And, while you're at it, read the book... it's better than the Keystone Cops."
2,Edutainment,"This video is edutainment. There is some science, but if you're at all interested in this topic, you probably know a lot of it. Most of the video is over-stylized BS that is typical of science programs these days. It's what passes for educational television in the 2000s. I'm sure this was a fun video to produce and to edit. You'll get all the cliches: fast wipes, intercuts, dissolves, sped-up clips, corny animations. Unfortunately it isn't all that interesting to watch and parts are just annoying. I could see this broadcast on The ""Learning"" Channel."
1,waste of time,"I'm a big GAE fan, but this was a pointless, boring book. I'm really sorry I didn't but it down before I finished it. At least it's short."
5,wildland firefighting,hi my name is chris j coombes and i have the book from donald parrey it is a good training book and it is a must have book for all of you wildland firefighters out there.thank you for your help. chris j coombes capt- of security. with placer hills fire dept.
2,Ho hum,"My 4 year old daughter is a huge princess fan, and loves Cinderella. So when we got the full size carriage, we got the Twinkle Lights Cinderella Doll too. But she's not very popular with my daughter, because you can't change her clothes. Since her dress is wired to light up and twinkle when you press a button, it has to stay on her. So if your child is like mine and loves to change her dolls' outfits, this doll won't be played with too much."
5,perfect barbie for a little girl,"We have owned this doll for about 3 years or so, it still looks great. It has held up well to many tea parties, trips in the car, and sleepovers. When I purchased it for my then 2 year old I liked that the dress doesn't come off it makes for less little pieces to get lost. There are some little pieces but not so many that you can't keep track of them. I would highly recommend this for anyone it has been a great doll that is still regularly played with years later and I can't say that for most of the toys that have been purchased for my daughter."
4,Shoes should be attatched,"I find it rather stupid that the dress is permanently fixed to the doll, but the shoes come off. I got this for my dd's 2nd bday because she loves Cinderella. Her feet look really dorky lighting up with no shoes on, but those had to be put up. Either way, my dd plays with it for the 30 seconds she plays with all of her other toys, so it was a good buy. Its also very beautiful. :-)"
1,Very dissapointing for my niece..,"This doll was very dissapointing for my niece and for me as well. At first I really liked the music but it got so annoying after a while unlike the Princess and the Pauper dolls. Then my niece was very sad that she couldn't brush her hair, she Loves brushing her dolls' hair. My niece only played with it for about 3 days, and I found it in her toybox with some of her fingers missing. If you buy this doll, buy it for an older collector not a child."
4,exacly what i wanted,"this is such a great item for girls of all ages! it lights beautifully and i do too collect some sort of disney tree but its not a tree! if you love, collect or just a fan of creative dolls than this is for you as for most of parts they could of made look more like cinderella but who never heard of making something better! will be a best buy this christams"
1,A Pretty Looky Looky doll,"We got this doll for my 3 yr old daughter, who loves Cinderella, but this doll, she can't really play with. The music is nice but cannot play with her hair and the only article of clothing that comes off are her tiny shoes. We have the doll sitting up on a shelf, how fun is that for a child??"
5,Extemely user-friendly,"As a mom of 3 young ones under age 11, I am always looking for things to do to avoid the ""mom, were boorrreeeddd!"" problem. I found this book at first at my local library and was so impressed I thought ""I HAVE to have it!""The authors have broken California down into the following areas: Central Coast, Greater Los Angeles, Orange County, The Inland Empire and Beyond, The Deserts, and San Diego County. At the end of each section is a monthly guide to events; seasonal events that happen regularly. Addresses, phone numbers, minimal directions and often times web sites are provided for ease of travel. They also include admission prices as well as suggestions for good family oriented restaurants.As a resident of the Inland Empire, I was impressed with the coverage of both well-known and much lesser known places and things to do. This is my kind of guide: easy to follow, great index in back and a good price. I can't wait to hop in the car and go!"
2,CA Native Diappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. I have a toddler and was hoping to find some new places to visit from this book, but that wasn't the case. I feel that this book only lists the big/major places (i.e., Disneyland, South Coast Plaza, etc.). For example, there was no mention of Irvine Park and the train that children can ride. This book would probably be useful for those visiting Southern CA, but not for natives trying to find something new and different to do with their families."
3,"Good book, but not always economical","I bought this book used, so it is a bit outdated. Many of the places are no longer even in existence. But, even still, I did get a few ideas for some new parks and things that I did not know were really close by. My main issue is that the suggestions are made with no real consideration for budget-minded families. I also wish there was more information about nature walks and hiking area, which I know are in the area."
3,"A bit disappointed, but good single source to look through","I found this book to be useful, it's nice to have a single source to remember all the things to do in So Cal with kids. Although my main disappointment was the lack of detail of where certain activities are located, for instance, the authors have Raging Waters in the Pasadena section. Or in Rancho Cucamonga they list 2 restaurants to go to that are NOT really kid friendly. I wonder how the ideas were suggested, if it was just a search from the web, etc. Like I said it is informative, but not really accurate (and very outdated)."
2,myah...,"So so. By Drake's standards, not his best work. Certainly, the scope and complexity of what he was attempting was larger than anything else he has done. Having said that, I couldn't help but notice that after the third or fourth battle in the Open Lands, everything seemed repeated. And repeated. And repeated. The sex scenes seem rather superfluous, as well.This isn't a bad book, but it shouldn't be ranked as high as some of the classics of the genre."
1,"poorly written, two dimentional characters","Northworld trilogy is an attempt to base a science fiction book on rich norse mythology. This book fails on many levels. The combat scenes are muddy and unclear. The characters are two dimentional, and many of their actions is meaningless and is never pursued throughout the story. The female characters are all oversexed morons who are easily manipulated by the male characters through their sexual urges. Each book goes through repetitious scenes with repetitious metaphors, and is ended when the author is bored (the reader was bored from the beginning). I do not recommend this book."
2,Northworld? Bleh.,"This book (Northworld) was unoriginal and rather boring. The characters were less than one-dimensional and quite frankly there was little to interest me. There was plenty of opportunity here for the author to more thoroughly develop his universe (social structure and characters). Instead he decided to focus on poor descriptions of combat sequences and the occasional deus ex machina to drag the story along. The book featured a main character about whom we couldn't care less, and one surrounded by blithering idiots to boot. Apparently in the author's mind, women exist simply to satisfy the sexual urges of male characters.Now, I understand that this was all based on Norse mythology, but there's no reason to preserve the same intellectual level.Fortunately I read this book without having to spend any money to do so (thanks Baen Free Library!)."
4,Beyond Sci-Fi,"Okay I will keep it short, although there have been criticisms of the ending, I don't agree with them, predictable yes but I don't see how that is automatically negative. But the true strong point of this work is how the author blends craft and wonderful ideas. I do like Simon R. Green and an earlier review had mentioned him as a better alternative, but Green does not have the craft or skill to his writing that Drake does. He has great ideas though. Basically what I am attempting to say is this, Northworld is a wonderfully written series that you can easily lose yourself in."
2,Not my style,Not my style of storytelling but it was free so no complaints about the cost. Glad I didn't pay for it.
2,"Old, out-dated, with some interesting parts","David Drake is one of my favorite authors and I eagerly await most the arrival of his new works.This is an older book, perhaps one of his earliest attempts.This book is actually 3 short novels, and they don't always transition well from one to another.It's sci-fi with a mythology base, and it's more a series of vignettes."
4,Interesting series,I enjoyed reading the triligy. Each book stands alone and is a good read by itself. I would recomend them
2,disappointment,"Normally I look forward to anything by David Drake; his military fiction is almost always topnotch. However, this trilogy was very un-drakelike, so much so I was unable to suspend my belief enough to make it through the first book."
1,Nothwood Trilogy,This book was so sow moving I had to make myself finish it. Historically was probably well done but boring.
2,Wasted potential,I finished this trilogy and thought to myself what could have been. I think the mythology which this trilogy was based on is fascinating. Unfortunately the author tried to make it futuristic. That would have been fine except there was no character development and there was no overall storyline. Perhaps the author would have been better served by writing a series of short stories instead of three novels.
4,very good book,needed this book for my structural geology class at UC Berkeley. Didn't buy the new version because it was too costly. this one works great!
2,Great if you're a researcher but not for beginners,"This book is WAY too much for beginning undergraduates. There are relatively few field/rock photographs and tons and tons of complex drawings of complex geometry of complex concepts. For a beginning American student, this book would surely make them turn-tail and flee as far away from structural geology as possible! Perhaps things are different in Mexico City."
4,"Structural Geology, Twiss and Moores 1st edition","At first I didn't realize that I buy the first edition instead of the 2nd edition which I am looking for, I receive my book and realize my mistake that's why it is cheaper than I thought it should be, but the book is in a very good condition,and the content is quite similar, so I am not too regret on it and I still can use this book in general"
4,affordable small tools,"Slow ship because of the holidays, item not a Dewalt, great little set for the price."
3,WARNING: Write-only memory for MP3 files,"I like the unit BUT: you cannot transfer MP3 files from this unit to a computer. Why? Ask them. Obviously, it's perfectly okay to transfer MP3 files -- that's how you get them onto the Nomad -- but it will NOT transfer the MP3 files back out. This was a real bummer: I had a lot of MP3 files on my work computer that I wanted to bring home. I put them on the Nomad, brought it home, and then discovered, in the fine print, that it will not transfer MP3 files to the computer. Rotten."
1,"Money NOT Well Spent--If I could rate it 0 stars, I would!!","... I decided to try to use the Nomad as an external hard drive (Creative touts the upgradeability of its firmware so as to enable it to recognize different formats)...and it would have served that purpose well, HAD IT WORKED AT ALL!! The device was DOA, and no amount of coaxing, battery changes, resets, and less-than-polite language will produce a display. OK, so I tried Creative's tech support--not even the courtesy of a reply...Quite possibly this is an isolated occurrence, but do you want to gamble hundreds of dollars on this potential paperweight?!?"
1,Worst Bussiness Transaction Ever Had,TMCONNECTIONDOTCOM service was not great then send me a defective product and when I returned It they said that was not the product they sold me. I am still fighting with this company to get my refund do not advise anyone to do bussiness with this company
2,Disappointment,"For me, it's all about the sound quality. I have an MP3 CD player, and am very happy with it, but I wanted to try something with a little more storage. And don't get me wrong, this is a great piece of equipment in every regard but one: sound quality. I was shocked at how bad it was. It has almost no bass, and when you turn it up it immediately distorts badly. Over half of the EQ presets were unuseable due to high distortion, crackling, and so on. Turning up the volume past about three-fourths produced distortion on almost every EQ setting. I returned it to the store and went back to my excellent sounding MP3 CD player within a week."
2,Wait for the second generation,"This is still a first generation product, with first-generation problems - a poorly-designed menu system on the player, flaky USB communications, shaky software, limited battery life, a size that barely qualifies as portable... Specifically:o It supports saving data files (theoretically making a nice backup device), but will drop the connection if you try to transfer a file >200MB or so.o The database gets messed up with ""duplicate"" information (e.g., the same title appearing twice in the same album).o The processor is underpowered, leading to problems if you try to, say, scan through the library while a VBR MP3 is playing.... and any number of minor annoyances.I'm returning mine - I'll try again when their 2nd generation jukebox is out, if I don't try the new Rio jukebox first."
5,The ultimate portable walkman. Period.,"When I heard this puppy could hold 500 hours worth of CD quality sounding music on it, it wasn't a question of if, but when I was going to have it. It's simple use made it one of the easiest purchases I have ever made.Other reasons to buy it? Never having to buy batteries again. It comes with 2 sets of rechargable batteries, providing up to 8 hours of listening enjoyment. It *never* skips, unlike CD players when walking, or exercising. Your CDs will last longer, since you will have transferred the music to mp3, and then onto your portable walkman, you'll no longer be switching out your cds to play another one."
3,Strange,"Steven Seagal really didn't need to play in this. It's really not him. He's better at just being in the other movies. Horror films, unless it's something different than this, leave this alone. He's still the man, though."
2,The Hospital looks familiar....,Anyone else notice that the scene showing the front of the hospital looks exactly like the scene from Stephen Kings Kingdom Hospital? Pretty sure it is the same one. Seagal in a vampire movie kind of struck me as odd but since the wife is a vampire movie buff we went ahead and picked it up. Glad I only spent the buck at Redbox!
1,Against the Dark w/ Steven Seagal cameo..................,"If your thinking of renting/buying this video because it looks like Stevie has done a horror movie well he has.....but that is just because how bad this film is. First-not scary. Second-Bad acting (worse than you would expect, I should say). Third-Seagal is hardly in the movie. The only time we see him is as he and his ""entourage' walk through this bldg easily striking down these creatures as they `step' out one at a time to be sliced and diced!! No thought put into any of these scenes.....it must have taken Stevie a cool 30 minutes on the set to come in and film his whopping < 8 minutes total and then go to another set to start another bad movie. Worst of all how do you have all these creatures running around and the movie is still boring? I was even having a beer and it was still bad........... DO NOT BE DECEIVED!!! THIS MOVIE REEKS!!!!"
1,I recommend this video...for those times when...,"...the paint has already dried on your freshly painted garage and there is no grass to watch grow...At least his last few releases have been MUCH better. Starting with Keeper and A Dangerous Man. But if you are a true fan, this is one of ""those"" that we just pretend never happened."
1,Worse than a Root-Canal,"Steven Seagal was never a good actor, he started out as a high demand stunt man/fight scene coordinator, in his first few on-screen roles he was quite good, he tapped into the vicarious regular white guy who gets revenge and kicks butt. Remember Billy Jack ?? not an original idea but entertaining so long as you weren't expecting a Fellini or Bergman classic.That said, has the guy no shame ?? even by today's pitifully low standards of dumbness, this is beyond belief, I know his movies make big money overseas, I can't imagine why when their own movies are SO much better.Even more surprising is his popularity in France & Italy, both countries have a long history of producing some of the best movies, directors, writers & actors that ever lived.Steven, move to Boca and stop embarrassing yourself.BTW: Try the salad bar once in a while."
3,AVERAGE,"Not great, not horrible. A different kind of film for Steven Segal. Bad news is he wasn't in too many scenes. There are creatures which are a combination of vampire/zombie. He and his team have a sole purpose of ridding the city of these virus-created creatures. They encounter survivors in a dark, spooky hospital who are working their way through by a former intern whose never really sure where they are. As usual, they start separating at which point a few of them get killed. Some guy from the State Dept. is supporting and communicating with Segal and his team and wants to make sure they are not in the area before it gets sterilized, which is what the military wants to do. They don't seem to care if any survivors or the hunters are free of the area. A few good fighting scenes, average acting, ok special effects. It had Steven Segal in it and that was good enough for me."
2,Vampires,"Forgettable vampire hunting flick starring Steven Seagal as a katana master. He and a few survivors are trapped in a hospital. Seagal is their only hope. While a decent flick, it lacks depth and compassion, though worth seeing once for vampire enthusiests."
3,Steven Seagal Movie,"It's not as good as his other movies, I like more action in them. I don't like the setting either but the plot is brilliant."
3,Better than expected. Not your typical Seagal movie,"From his first movie, Above the Law (aka Nico), Steven Seagal has always been the star of his movies (with the exception of Executive Decision where he had a cameo). ""Against the Dark"" breaks the trend. It's not really a ""Steven Seagal movie"" but rather an average B-grade post-apocalyptic zombie movie featuring Steven Seagal, in a heroic role of course, but with limited screen time.Those hoping for an action movie with Seagal as the star may be disappointed, but taken for what it is, a postapocalyptic horror movie, I think it works pretty well, and Seagal is a bonus. It's nice to see him try new things. There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half."
1,I honestly tried to watch it,"But it is to freaking long. At 94 minutes this movie is exactly 93 minutes and 59 seconds to long. I mean walking in the Hallway, walk walk walk walk. Then walk some more. See zombie, vampire thingy and run run run. Avoid thingy then walk walk walk. Repeat this for the 93 minutes. Oh, lets throw in 59 seconds of fighting and call it a day. Bad, bad bad. I really tried to watch it but at about 45 minutes into the movie you will go into the kitchen, grab a spoon and take your eyes out. I almost did and the only thing that stopped me was the movie is so forgettable that I forgot what I was doing half way to the kitchen and went to use my computer. When I got up again I saw this zombie movie on tv and watched a few moments of it before watching something else."
3,Far too traditional,"I bought this cd hoping that I could pick up some tracks for my belly dance performances. I was a bit disappointed because both CDs are quite heavy to listen to and not very inviting for dancing. Perhaps someone more expert than me on authentic middle eastern music would appreciate this style. I personally prefer Ramzy's El Amar, which is more pleasing to the ear."
1,Box of Broken Bits,"I had read another review of Corelle dinnerwear where the customer said she got a box of broken plates. She returned them and the next box also made the same crunching sound. Well, now I know what she meant. The Amazon packaging was very loose and there was nothing surrounding the box of Corelle. This material does not ship well, nor is it packaged appropriately. I am requesting a refund and will buy locally. What a shame!"
4,Pastoral Assistant,This is an excellent product for young children. It's use of verbage and simple explanations makes it ideal for a child's very first bible. Parents wil be amazed at how easy comprehension is with this Bible.
1,"A poorly made, poorly written, and poorly acted tv movie","Don't waste your money buying this or your time watching it. There wasn't a single moment during my viewing of this made for tv movie that I wasn't acutely aware of the poor acting, writing and production of it. A good western must have a sense of the outdoors and the characters should seem like they really do live in the old west. This movie has neither."
4,good western,"I first saw this on TV and liked it. I love the beautiful settings in this western, and the scenery which is different from most. Best of all, I like Luke Perry and his acting. He has a handsome, rugged face, which has the capacity to look kind when needed, and positively hard and calculating when called for. That is an unusual quality and what adds to his acting ability. It is pretty much predictable, for which I would normally only give three stars, but the whole together, for me, makes it a four star film. If you are looking for a western with a difference, this isn't it, but if you are a fan of westerns, this one is great."
3,Sent it back,Arrived with a broken coil and made for a terrible experience. I thought that in no way would the antenna be wrong so balmed it on the radio. I spent over $80.00 in shipping returning and getting a functional radio. Went with a much less expensive antenna and works fine. How does it get shipped with a bad coil?
3,Wilson 880-200152B 5000 Series Mobile CB Antenna with 62-in Whip,"This Wilson 5000 Mobile CB Antenna doesn't work the way I expected. I thought it is better than the Wilson 1000. Actually it's not. It transmits and receives about the same range as the the Wilson 1000, but I like the Wilson 1000 10 times better than Wilson 5000 because it has a very strong magnetic mount and it holds a lot better than the Wilson 5000."
3,wilson 5000 from amazon,"Overall I am well satisfied with a Wilson antenna, finest available for a car,truck, or suv, however amazon did not specify that it did not come with the 62"" whip, however their product description seemed to indicate otherwise. I did inform them of this but seeing that not everyone knows everything about all things, they promptly sent me a replacement and a return label for the first one however the replacement did not have the whip either. It seems that amazon is unfamiliar with this product, and don't realize their only selling half of this product because it is sold complete anywhere else you would buy this product. In closing I plan to keep this antenna because in my installation i will have to have the extended 66"" inch whip any way, this is the reason for the 3 star rating, I feel amazon should change their product description to clear up any further con fusion, maybe ""Does not include 62"" whip"""
1,Wilson antenna,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my dad. Amazon did not ship the whip antenna with the mount. I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent another. It also arrived without the whip antenna. I contacted them again telling them that per the reviews, some people are receiving the whip and some are not, and requesting the whip antenna be sent. They said they can not send only the antenna and I should place another order. Again, it arrived without the whip. I contacted the Wilson company to confirm that a whip should come with the mount. I am now in the process of returning all three mounts. It is unfortunate in that the mount seemed very high quality but due to Amazon's incompetence they can not properly process the order even when the customer tells them the exact problem and reviews are being left that there is a problem. It is also unfortunate that I didn't have my father's present on Christmas."
4,Traditional collection,"I originally purchased this album because it was the only recording I could find with the track Mairi Bhan Og (Mary Young and Fair), the song my wife and I used for our first dance at our wedding. But the entire collection is fantastic. the music is all traditional Scottish music, sung in Scots Gaelic. They range from the hauntingly beautiful Seann Triubhais Uilleachain to the upbeat As a Thoiseach. This recording should be in the collection of all people serious about traditional Scottish music."
2,Swagger Like Us: Ghetto & Country,"Starts off as girls gone mild, 30 minutes of semi-flashy cars and following girls in short shorts around. around 30 minutes in you get a few girls flashing, then more semi-flashy cars. their car shows are much milder than any biker event I've been to. then at 60 minutes it turns to Girls gone Nasty, several pairs of ""ladies"" in mostly cheap motels rooms till the film runs out."
1,horrible,Super ghetto by far one of the worst videos ever. DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT WATCH!!! Garbage is the closest thing i can think of to describe this video
1,Stunk,"Don't waste your money. Definitely not worth it. Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk,"
4,Glenn,"Great mailbox. Holds several days worth of my wife's catalogues. Seems to be made of slightly lighter metal than the fifty year old box that it replaced but it will be just fine for decades, if that kid with the baseball bat doesn't come through the neighborhood again."
2,cheaper elsewhere,"I checked ithese out and was concerned about the ""plastic parts"" and the enormous shipping charge. I decided to check out some of the stores in the area and found a Gibraltar brand that is all steel. There are no plastic parts. I didn't have to pay the shipping charges and it was the same price ($28.00). They were on sale at Menards and Farm & Fleet."
1,soggy wet mail,"I have to hang my mail up to dry. This mailbox is terrible. Even with the door as carefully shut as it can go, my mail still gets extremely wet."
4,Large and Heavy Guage,"Purchased this ~5 years ago thru Amazon; delivered OT and packaged very well as normal, from Amazon…Its ad renders measurement etc but I must add the box is Quality Made, mine anyway…It’s made of good gauge galvanized tin, painted black, albeit the latch and red flag are plastic…It’s not a ‘waterproof’ container and heavy rain/snow will seep into front thru large front door…However, a little foam-rubber self-adhesive weather stripping will remedy this issue easily, quickly and cheaply…The latch is by all account flimsy, but if rubber stripping is placed appropriately onto the rear of door, it’ll facilitate keeping the door closed while keeping water out."
4,Town Snowplow Ran over Mailbox,"This was an exact replacement for my mailbox that was flattened by the town snowplow. I bought it before and might have to buy it again before this winter ends - when I went to the internet to find an indestructible mailbox or method of setting one up - I was disappointed to read that - not only is the death of mailboxes common in rural areas - but all the different efforts to make it indestructible were costly and uniformly not indesructible. So the price for this jumbo mailbox was jus right. I gave it 4 stars - not 5 - because it didn't come bundled with a post, mounting bracket or exact information about what else was needed to get the box up and ready for mail. I searched for a book on ""Mailbox Repairs for Dummies"" - found none - and my web search made me, a 66yo female, frustrated as I tried to put together the best plan to replace mine."
2,Plastic parts do not age well outdoors,I agree with other reviewers that the problem with this box is the lack of available replacement parts for the plastic latch which WILL fail. Simple plastic part now not available at all as far as I call tell. Will spend more for a box with metal latches (such as Gibraltar brand)for a replacement.
4,Huge Mailbox - Recommended,"We picked up this ""Jumbo"" mailbox at a local big box store after our postal carrier decided to stop bringing packages to our front porch when they wouldn't fit in our old standard size box, requiring me to go to the post office to pick them up.The box is very large and reasonably sturdy when properly mounted on a secure post. The door opens and closes as expected, keeping the contents dry even in heavy rain. We almost never have outgoing mail so the somewhat flimsy flag isn't an issue for us, but I'm not sure that it would hold up well to a lot of use over time.This works well for my needs.Recommended!CFH"
2,weak metal,"We were attempting to replace a mailbox here in the country of the same size. Not so. Also, the metal was not as strong as the old mailbox which is now painted and we're happy."
2,quality no longer exists in this country,"When I opened the box the mailbox was in, I didn't notice the damage on one side of the mailbox. There was no damage to the carton but one side of the mailbox had a large dent in it. The box I was replacing is over 40 years old. It has been knocked off the post it was mounted upon several times. It had a couple of minor dents about the size a golf ball would make. The door had finally given up the ghost and rusted off ... after going through over 40 Vermont winters. I will be surprised it I don't out live the new one.I pounded the dent (new box) out with a 'dead-blow' hammer. The metal is about 1/4 to 1/3 of the thickness of the new one. I hit the old box with the hammer and it didn't even leave a mark on it. I should have bought a new hinge and put it on the old box.I rate the new box as what most people would call crap. (Feel free to substitute crap with any other word.JATowslee"
2,Not to happy,I had to beat the dents out of it. I could tell by the packaging that it was damaged before it was shipped.
4,No more little pink notice slips from the mail carrier!,"My uncle has a box like this, and I have often admired it. I am delighted to say goodbye to trips to the post office to pick up every little package because I have dogs.This mailbox is huge. Most packages that are too bit to fit in there would probably be delivered by UPS anyway. It comes with the hardware inside, though we had to buy some additional brackets to get it mounted.I highly recommend this for the modern online shopper :-)"
4,All aspiring musicians should read this book!,"What I liked best about the book was how straightforward and honest it is. There's some great vignettes and insights into what it means to be a professional musician. It's both humorous and poignant.I am a fan of his music, but I've never really understood what makes the man tick until now. That prickly character is a sensitive perfectionist-- a man who sets high standards for himself and who has always wanted to challenge himself musically. It's remarkable, but not surprising, that he's as good a memoirist as he is a musician."
5,A look into creative genius,"Joe Jackson's music entered my mind in 1978 and has lodged there ever since. He's one of the few pop musicians I followed for more than two albums, because he continally reinvented himself. It was a great discovery to find that he had written an autobiography.The focus is on his musical development up to the point when his LP ""Look Sharp!"" made him famous, but it is also informed by what happened afterwards. I enjoyed this book very much, and dusted off the turntable to play his records again. They are every bit as great as I remembered them."
1,He knows nothing,"I am very upset about Mr. Jackson's comment on Workinton, England. He obviously doesn't really know the place. It is where my mother is from, and it is filled with such beauty and warmth. I suggest Mr. Jackson take another visit."
2,NOT a good intro to French,"From a beginner's standpoint, the lessons were difficult to understand. You don't quite know what the point of the different exercises were and there was no real emphasis on explanation or repetition. The French In Action Video series (Capretz method) does a MUCH better job of teaching."
1,Keep searching for a decent audio course,"I don't know what the other people are talking about this series is awful. I bought the set with 13 compact discs and a book ... If you already have a basic knowledge of French and want to practice conversation then it might be good for you. If you are just starting you will be dissapointed. Common sense would dictate starting with a foundation and working your way up. This course jumps straight into dialogue. There is a vocabulary list of the words but the word's aren't recorded individually so you can make sure that you are pronouncing them correctly. Instead the words are included in the dialouge section which flows at a native speed which is way too fast to see if you are saying it correctly. If you buy this course you might find yourself asking ""Parle vou anglais""."
2,Foreign service diplomats?,"I have the CD version of this course, and although I did not pay full price, it was still too expensive considering the content. The repetition is helpful for pronunciation, but the same sentences are repeated over and over in every exercise ... so you walk away knowing how to say three sentences in varying forms, with little useful vocabulary.In addition, the recording quality is quite low, with other conversations often audible in the background of the dialogue and a constant hiss.While perhaps a passable foundation for someone with time to spend, it is certainly not the best course to prepare you to travel in France. At the least, it would need to be combined with a course that teaches some minimal vocabulary useful for travel situations. I just returned from several days in Paris, and found myself essentially dependent upon sign language, even after completing 10 of the 13 CDs in the set."
3,Too Much Info,"This is a very through book but the subject material is not presented so one can read it and pass. The material from all three tests are not divided into any kind of order, instead the materal is broken into chapters that will confuse you if you are reading just to pass the tests. The other problem that I have is some of the questions at the chapters end are experience questions... where the answer is not necessarly in the chapter but you are expected to know it. Microsoft reccomends one year as an Administrator to take the test... really it should be more like five. The questions are going to be too advanced for someone in their mid career. If you are set on buying this book it is good as an overall book, but you will also need somthing like exam cram for each test. Hope this helps"
2,Could be a lot better,"I fell to one of the perils of buying a book online. This book is not organized by exam, rather by tasks. The chapters have material for all three exams. They provide a matrix at the back of the book telling you what to read for each exam.I am undecided if I will keep this book or ask for an RMA. The authors explain the book can be used as a reference in addition to test prep. I am an IT Professional with over five years experience. I have a shelf of reference books, I was looking for a test prep book.I have to say I am not impressed by this book, and if I had been able to find it at the bookstore to look at it before buying, I would not have picked it up."
1,Unresponsive Seller,I ordered Bob The Buildier - Muck's Favorite Adventures with Toy VHS solely for the Muck the Truck toy for my two-year old son. The VHS arrived without the toy! I emailed the seller twice requesting the toy and never heard back. The product description says there are 20 more available. The cost to return the VHS is not worth it. The seller's misleading product description then total lack of service was an extreme disappointment.
3,Not really barefoot per se,"Couple quick notes:Most homes featured are new, few are retrofitted. Most done by architects in a modern style.For a barefoot home, it seems unusual that most floors are concrete. Very few rugs, I didn't see any carpet.I would've liked to have seen the rest of the property or at least how the house sits on the site. Driveways are not addressed. Nearly every house has a large lot and amazing views (which most of us do not have). Does not really address how to achieve a barefoot home with a nominal budget."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a little more advice about how to decorate and organize your home in order to have a ""Barefoot Home"" but it was more about showing designer homes and discussing their traits, rather than making your own."
1,slick professional coffee table book,"I was disappointed; it was slick and well presented but unless you live at the beach or in the woods, there is very little the average homeowner could incorporate into her home to make it more comfortable. We need a book that helps us make our homes comfortable/casual and liveable. This is not the book. The Not So Big House series does a much better job than this. It does look good on the coffee table though; sort of like Coastal Living without ads."
2,Wish I hadn't .....,Guess these are just not the style of houses I like. Wish I hadn't ... bought it. I like and understand the concept but not the styles.
4,"Designed for wilder, more remote locations","This book is beautiful, the writing lyric and inviting.But in looking for ideas for building our coastal home, I found that the windows and outdoor living areas were meant for homes in secluded or tree-sheltered locations, not on a city lot as our will be.I highly recommend this book for those with more remote building sites."
4,"Good, high-quality fish oil","At the recommendation of my doctor and the Crossfit gym I belong to, I decided to start taking fish oil. A friend recommended Nordic Naturals to me and I went with it even though it was not enteric coated my doctor had recommended (to help prevent ""fish burps"") because the quality is higher than the enteric coated ones I found. So far, so good. I do taste it a bit in the 30 minutes after I take it but I got the lemon flavor, so it's not bad and definitely not anything that bothers me too much. If you take it with food, it's better. Overall, happy and will continue to order it."
3,"An entertaining effort, yet without much substance","Krevolin writes a novel, entertaining book that is a fresh and original deeparture from the canon of almost indistinguishable screenwriting books. Yet for all Krevolin's philosophical brilliance, the book is fairly devoid of substance. This book should be read only after readers acquaint themselves with other, more enlightening works, such as Robert McKee's ""Story"" or Hauge's ""Writing Screenplays that Sell."""
5,Great,"It's educational and entertaining. In the format of a student writing to a retired screenwriter. One of the very first books I read on screenwriting and one of my favorite. It doesn't give enough advise to be fantastic or help you a greast deal, but I give it five stars beacuse it's a great read. Don't put it as you're first read but as one when you find you interest weening."
5,"All time classic CD,.","ABSOLUTELY Timeless.... Deep, Soulful, and Tribal House music.... If you live and breathe House you should aready have this, if not you really do need this in your collection. When this set first appeared back in 2002 I knew this was something special, an instant classic that would be revered in years to come. This critically acclaimed set changed the game back in the 00's. Sandy and the crew lay it down from top to drop in the way it (House Music) should be heard and proves that House music oozes soul and drips passion. Without doubt the Sandy's - KOT Sesions is in my opinion the best of all the Ministry Sessions. A lot of today's House music pales in comparison to this, and even KOT have not surpassed this piece of musical genuis since. I only wished they included their killer production/redition of the George Duke classic 'I Want You For Myself' on this..... Thanks for your time reading this."
4,Excellent Find,"I got this CD after I kept hearing ""Life Changes"" on PRI's World Cafe. The whole CD is solid. I'm still trying to figure out how to describe it. The best I can come up with is the Cranberries Dolores O'Riordan fronting Luscious Jackson singing songs written by Beth Orten."
1,ncw did it again.,heard this cd several yrs. ago. still love it- kudos for ncw/spindale- turned me on to an amazing lady. one of my favorites
5,One of the best,"Agatha Christie never fails to amaze. I have read quite a number of her books. The Sittaford Mystery, in my opinion, one of her best. The clues to the guilty party are all there, but so many other suspects were possible. Fully recommended to Kindle readers."
5,A Classic Mystery Tale,"This is a classic mystery novel.This book has everything. A Great setting,great characters,and the perfect season. this is a gripping and wonderful Christie classic."
3,A game of Tommy Rot (table turning)becomes horrifyingly true,It was a thrilling book that kept you wanting more.Once you get past the beginning you can't put it down.The characters were realistic and the story was believable.There's enough information for you to guess the killer but it's not obvious.I would recommend this book to mystery lovers.
4,Good yarn,Vintage Agatha set in two small English villages in the middle of a snow storm. A couple of wacko eccentrics are thrown in for good measure.
4,The Sittaford Mystery,"Not one of Christie's best, but even on an off day she's better than most. A satisfying and entertaining read."
3,Okay but didn't hold my attention,"A ""fun"" séance at a snowbound dinner party reveals the death of the owner of the house, living six miles away. Inspector Narracott soon discovers that one of the heirs stayed that night at the local pub and charges him with the murder, but his fiance Emily is determined to prove him innocent and takes herself to tiny Sittaford to investigate.Never really caught my attention. The focus shifts from a concerned dinner guest to conscientious Inspector Narracott to manipulative Emily. I got halfway through and skipped to the end, so I'm not sure if the clues were provided for the reader to guess whodunit."
2,"The Trail Beyond,Paradise Canyon","These movies are so old that they jump around on the screen.They are of poor quality, both acting and technically."
1,OK But...,Not bad as long as you don't mind the logo (bug)printed on the lower right throughout. I do.
1,This is not a John Wayne Film Title: John Wayne: Stolen Goods,"John Wayne: Stolen GoodsJohn Wayne never made a movie with the title Stolen Goods. Check IMDB.com.As usual, I have to add a note here that Amazon is attaching this review to multiple products. BUT, John Wayne never made a movie titled Gold Strike River either."
4,Good but trick missed...,The series is excellent so no problems with the content of the disc. The packaging is interesting but flawed:This is a special edition DVD but it doesn't come in the cardboard sleeves that the rest of the SE series do. The metal container that it does come in has been designed to accomodate all seven DVDs of the series but ONLY if they are removed from their cardboard sleeves! So are we meant to throw the sleeves away or what?! The T-shirt is OK. My Tachikoma ID card was damaged but otherwise no issues.
5,yes,"if you have seen the others you know what you are going to getif you have never seen ""ghost in yhe shell"" buy it,see it,love it"
4,Nice Package Huge Shirt,Great set. I thought there was a scratch on the second disc but it played perfectly. The metal box is great. I put all my Gits dvds and tapes in it. The shirt is nice to look at. But I'm not a big person. I feel like I could live in it.
3,Fictional city?,Niihama is actually a real city on the island of Shikoku in Japan. It is a highly industrialized port city.
4,Good help for toddlers who hate checkups,"As always, I'm a little disappointed at the amount of song, footage, and theme reuse on the various bear videos, but my 210 month old daughter seems to love them! Bear helps kids to feel good about shots, exams, and visiting the doctor's office."
2,Don't bother buying it.,"So I bought this book and the authorized self-study guide to study for the CCNA Security 640-553 exam. The self-study guide already covered material, so buying this book is a bit redundant.Pros - It was cheap used.Cons - Dated.For starters not familiar with Cisco I'd recommend reading one the Security+ books instead."
2,Reads like a text book.,"This review may not be entirely fair, as the first 40 pages of the book were so dry I could not finish it. It was like reading a text book. Based on the other review on this site, I tried to push on, but just couldn't spend the time reading something that I wasn't enjoying. The map at the beginning of the text didn't even include the places being mentioned in the history described in these first 40 pages. I was so looking forward to reading a historical account, but was expecting more of a story, and less of a text book.If you are looking for a straightforward factual account, this may be the book for you. I, however, was disappointed."
4,not bad tlc video's it could be better,"it could've had the videos of hands up, damage, get it up, hat 2 da back, dear,lie and it could've had 2 t-boz's videos touch myself n my getaway and lefteye's video block party."
4,Old School,It was good to see a blast from the past I only wish this was on dvd. THe VHS is fine. If you like the group you'll like this vhs.
4,Expect the unexpected!!,This DVD is great. What about Your Friends and Unpretty! Have some exrtra scenes in them that you dont see on YouTube. The shipping took 2 days... very quick!!!!
2,Written in book,"This was a book recommended to us by our pastor. It is a workbook style book and I was disappointed to find out when we received it that it was filled out in ink. I feel that the listing should have stated this or it should have not been offered for sale. It is not even worth the price of the shipping. In the past we have ordered 2 books on separate occasions to give as gifts. One was sent in a thin envelope and damaged in the mail. The other was advertised as new and came in a box, but the book was scrunched. I do not plan to buy any more books from Amazon.com."
5,Supurb,I read with awe the interweaving of Arthur Hailey's plot(s). He has done a splendid job of tying all of the characters together. His knowledge of Miami was noted also. I especially enjoyed the way he blended police work with morality.This was an excellent read and I recommend it highly.
5,Rational and non-inflamitory summary of the New Age.,"Father Pacwa is one of the few Christian writers, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, who is able to write about the subject without losing his readers in a web of delusional conspiracy theories. He assesses the dangers, philisophical implications, and silliness of many aspects of New Age culture, and relates them to his own life experiences. This book is already a Christian classic."
1,Poorly researched,"Poorly researched is the best way to describe this afront to the field of behavioral and Jungian psychology. The tone of this book suffers from a kind of psycho-spiritual inertia that tries to keep faithful Catholics from becoming educated. Hopefully, they'll see through it."
2,Don't expect too much,"This is a run-of-the-mill book on the tirade of Christians (or Churchians?) who abhor the New Age for attracting the Western Population. Much like other authors who have attempted to ""disprove and discredit other religions with insufficient evidence"", Pacwa also falls into the same pitfall.OTOH, if you're a Churchian who loves to rant and rave against the New Age, this is a must-read book!"
1,Faulty valve,The bleeder screw had a faulty valve and it would not close. It squirted brake fluid all over my motorcycle.
4,"Great, although little heavy.","Great watch, you can feel the quality. Very classy. The only downside I would mention is its weight.And the luminous paint on my watch isn't doing its job, therefore I can't really read it at dark night, but I still love it!If you are not used to really thin or lightweight watches, you won't regret buying this one. For less than 40 bucks I think is the best you can have."
5,preciso,"Mi ha fatto veramente molto piacere acquistare da te.Sei un venditore, molto preciso e serio.Itempi di consegna sono stati brevi ed i costi molto ragionevoli.A presto"
4,^^,"The music on this first OST is wonderful. Much of the music (obviously) comes from the series. The best track on here is probably Hanyou Inuyasha/ Half-Monster Inuyasha. A few pop tracks are included as well and make a nice addition. I would recommend, however, that those looking for some of the wonderful orchestration by Kaoru Wada look elsewhere. The prices on Amazon are bit too expensive."
2,Sean Faris Fell Off Big Time,"After Never Back Down, I expected Sean Faris to at least follow in the footsteps of NBD Co-Star, Cam Gigandet. Lol! He usually appears in crap also but at least it gets a chance in the theaters. I've played the videogames a few times and am no expert on characters but this film is just lame. The fight sequences are weak and the so-called cgi is super-generic. I wouldn't even rent it. Wait for it to pop up on cable tv somewhere at 2am on a Tuesday night and DVR it if you're interested. KOF isn't even a fun bad film. It's just bad. Sean needs Cam's agent."
2,"King of Something, but not of fighters","Ok. Let me go on record as saying the movie is ok. Maggie Q delivers a good performance, but she is no Mai. Ray Park is supposed to be Rugal and the Rugal i know never skateboarded. I give the movie credit in the creation of a virtual world tournament and the attempt at a story line. deviation from the source is not a good thing. No video game based movie that deviates from the source is great. The reason for the success of Mortal Kombat and Tekken is that they stay mostly true to their source. KOF is a tournament not a showcase for ok acting. If you a fan of King of Fighters do not take this movie seriously. If you are a fan of Maggie Q please watch Preist or Nakita before juding her fighting and acting potential. If you are looking to kill two hours while not playing the game then this is ok. Better than watching grass grow and on par with Street Fighter the movie. It falls just short of Legend of Chun-Li and that is saying quite a bit."
4,only for KOF fans,"This movie really isn't bad, and is quite enjoyable. Definitely a must see for any King of Fighters fan. The story is creative, the action and special effects are well done. Most importantly, the film is faithful to the characters, and attempt to make them appear like their video game counterparts. It's not as bad as the other reviewers state. Definitely better than any Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat film to date."
1,Qué verdadera estafa....,"Acabo de ver la película ""King of Fighters"" que lastimosamente compré, soy amante de los video juegos de peleas desde que tengo recuerdo y sinceramente, después de la película de Street Fighter y la de Mario Bros, ésta es la más mala que hay, es totalmente incoherente en relación al juego, lo único igual son los nombres de los personajes, el vestuario de algunos (2) y como un 5% de la historia: que asco.... no vale ni el tiempo invertido en verla, los personajes no concuerdan en nada a la historia a excepción de Iori Yagami y Kyo Kusanagi, nunca he visto a un Rugal Bernstein y un Terry Bogard más denigrante.... una desepción similar a la que sentí al ver la película de Dragon Ball."
1,pure horrible CRAP!,"im warning anyone who wants to check this garbage out dont buy, first off the story doesnt follow the game actually there is no plot, the acting is horrific, the actors look nothing like the video game characters, the action does not help the movie horribly cheographed. All in out the whole movie suck so bad that i couldnt stomach it enough to finish it, its like watching a Uwe Boll movie. if you want to check it out then rent it(doesnt deserve a rental)."
1,made me cry,Wanted to see it for so long then I got the import about a year ago and it was so so very bad. You best save you money. My friend and I did watch it long time Video game and fighting game fans and all we could talk about it's how bad it was. Now if you want to hear about the movie bad story bad acting bad casting bad fighting not change all the bad's to horrible nightmare and that's KOF movie. Save you money and time.
4,Excellent collection of papers,"There is hardly anything out in the public domain on the subject of gas turbine life prediction, so this volume is a welcome addition to the subject ! Many of the authors are well known, and if you're a graduate student you'll probably save some $$ by ordering their papers directly from your library. If you work in the gas turbine life prediction field, then you probably know most of the stuff contained here .. still, its well worth the expense report. Related books include ""Damage Mechanisms and Life Assessment of High Temperature Components"" by R. Vishwanathan. The problem with both of these books is that they still treat gas turbine life assessment as a deterministic problem when its really a stochastic problem that needs to be handled using probabilistic design algorithms."
1,sugared popcorn,"I wish that I could rate lower. With no information on the package except for ""flavors"" this tastes like it has been drizzled in sugar cane. Why? Why not be upfront and tell customers it has a sweet flavor that obliterates the saltiness. Ychhh."
1,Not quite Iceberg,"Not awful enough to diss, but not good enough to throw 2, 3, 4 or 5 stars at. If it was my 1st Pimp book I would love it, but there is feirce competition from Iceberg, Paradise, Stonewall Jackson, Don Juan, American Pimp, Hoes Up Pimps Down. And frankly if you have THEM you don't need this book. This guy isn't even pimping like a pro most of the time, he dabbles and there are no new pearls of wisdom here to use."
3,"Looks great, but has annoying 'buzz'","Just got this range hood (branded as a 'Kenmore', but looks exactly the same)...Pros:-variable speed fan (not just low and high speed)-good looks-strong enough to move some air on highCons:-Really annoying buzz from the motor (tranformer?) at any speed.(we had a more expensive model that didn't fit, and that motor was perfectly quiet on low...although it only had high and low speed, and the high speed sounded like a jet engine)The noise is a bummer, other than that, it's good."
2,"Broan QT230SS 30"" Range Hood","This product is supposed to be a ""quiet"" model yet there is ""hum"" or ""buzz"" (probably the transformer for variable speed fan) underlying the fan noise regardless of what speed the fan is adjusted to. I would return this product if not for the inconvenience and the fact that my contractor disgarded the packaging."
4,broan range hood,"The range hood was delivered quickly and undamaged. The fan works well. The product information on this range hood states the fan can be unplugged (for cleaning) however, the fan cannot be unplugged! Otherwise the product and quality of the range hood is what was expected."
4,easy install,"I am 62 yrs old & prefer to do my own installations whenever possible. With a little light lifting help from my son-in-law, we had it up in about 45 minutes! I used electrical tape & wire nuts for connection, & done. Does take 2 to do, FYI."
2,range hood not great,"This was easy enough to install. the construction is such that there is an annoying rattle when we turn on the fan. not a great hood but it was the only one that really worked for our space and requirements (no direct vent, no halogen bulbs)."
4,Replacement hood,"I bought this hood to replace a 45 year old Broan range hood. This unit looks so much nicer than the old, plus has a variable speed motor and two position light. It is much quieter than my old hood. I installed it as a duct-less unit. It took less than 30 minutes to remove the older unit and install this one. (By the way, the old unit still worked fine. It was just old and time to update.) Overall, very happy. I guess you could spend more, but this has all the function you need. And yes, I did order the bpqtf filter that is recommended when you install as a duct-less unit. We like the night light feature too!"
3,Looks Great,Product seems to work well. I suspect it is better as a ventless system then when placed with a regular vent. Doesnt seems to work as well but it looks great.
3,Decent Quality but a bit noisy,The hood looks nice and has a nice finish. But the knobs and light cover feel a bit cheap and the fan is too noisy for my liking.
3,it's ok,"the range hood is ok, but you need to be careful because the picture does not reflect what you get... the range hood is totally different to what they illustrate... but there is nothing i can do. Anyway it is not so bad."
1,Looks nice... but...,"We purchased this a little over a year ago. It does look much nicer than our previous range hood. The unit has two major flaws however. First, the fan must be off balance. When you run it, it sounds like a playing card in the spokes of a bicycle wheel.More important is the plastic lens over the light fixture. In one year I've replaced that lens at least 3 times. They keep melting and shattering! And yes, I'm using the correct bulb... and trying not to use it very often! The company is very good about sending new ones, but really???? I've gotten to the point where I'm tired of dealing with it and just leaving it without the lens.Go with a different make or model!!"
2,Fan stopped working exactly after the one year warranty,I bought it for the good rating people had given here. And boufht it from amazon as it was much cheaper than store price. But the fan stopped working within couple of months after the warranty got over. I am confused if i should buy another broan product. I was expecting the product to work for atleast 3-4 years. Broan should consider increasing their warranty if they want to keep customers happy.
2,Allota wind,"Personally, if i had to do it again I would have gone for a different range. The only reason I picked this one was due to size contraints...It looks kind of cheap, the metal is thin and flimsy and even with dual dampers the cold air still rushes in. The unit arrived with a piece loose in the box, which broke due to being jostled around. And the sheet metal used to fabricate it wasnt completely tight and when the unit is on, the metal flaps back and forth making ALOT of noise. I think its 40% louder because of it! I just dont feel like dealing with sending it back and getting another one, and then have the same issue repeat...we just jerry rigged it to fix SOME of the issues....over all I am disappointed. If I had to do over I would get a Zephyr."
3,A+++,"good item not to bad for the price, got to keep it clean all the time unless grease can easily stick to it"
2,not worth the money,I bought this item reading above 3 reviews. I am really disappointed by this dvd.it is definitely not for kids below 4 yrs of age.it does not even last for 1 hr and really not worth $15. i would pay $5 for this kind of dvd.As the title says that i teaches addition and sentences is just not true.
2,Not great,"The shipping was fast, but the product is not great. It looks faded and just not great quaLITY, LIKE SOMEONE TOOK A PICTURE OF THE ORIGINAL, then printed it on large paper. Not bold/crisp for a poster. You get what you pay for! I got two posters and they both are lackluster."
2,Maran Illustrated Mac OS X v. 10.4 Tiger,Much too elementary for someone who has used previous versions of Mac OS X. I don't think I picked up one new idea.
1,so so shaver,"I purchased this shaver because I have sensitive skin and thought this would eliminate the bumps while giving me a really close, smoothe shave. While the irritaion was less, the shave was not close. Good for winter when the legs aren't too exposed but in general not worth the purchase bc the shave is not close. You feel the stubles as soon as your done."
5,Corelle with personality,I love my new Corelle pattern. I enjoy seeing it every time I get it out of the cupboard. I only wish all the pieces shown on the display photo were available and also other accessory pieces. I didn't like the racial profiling in the original description of the pattern given by Corelle. I was so excited to see a Corelle pattern with color and a design without flowers.
1,Bad customer services,"PRODUCTS ARE FINE; AMAZON IS LOUSY!!!You have the worst customer services of all web sites I have dealt with.I can not write to you directly, or even respond to your messages.I will not deal with outfits that do not accept responses to their own email messages!!I WAS a frequent customer. NOT ANY MORE. Look at my last orders and your pathetic responses- wich are mostly computer generated!!! How can you be in bussiness and be so insensitive towards customers!!!Give this to the CEO!!! He needs to knowAnd take me out of your lousy, poorly designed message generators!!!CLOSE MY ACCOUNTS!!"
4,A mystical journey,"""The Journey to the East,"" by Hermann Hesse, has been translated from German into English by Hilda Rosner. The book is narrated in the first person by a musician who, as a member of a secret society known as ""the League,"" undertook a mystical journey. This book chronicles the narrator's quest to write the story of this pilgrimage.""Journey"" is a very ""writerly"" text; it's largely about the challenge of representing life experience as a written document. The book also deals with writing as both catharsis and as a burden, and with the larger issue of finding meaning in one's life. The book has touches of fantasy and offers intriguing glimpses at the inner workings of a secret society.Hesse's prose, as translated by Rosner, has an elegant simplicity and subtle power. Recommended as companion texts: ""The Guys,"" by Anne Nelson (also about the catharsis and burden of writing); and ""The Sun at Night,"" by Roger Williamson (also deals with a secret mystical society)."
4,Very Interesting Book,"I came to this book through Tom Wolfe, who quoted from it at length in his book, ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"". Wolfe drew many parallels between Ken Kesey leading his Merry Pranksters on great adventures throughout America and Hesse's fictional travels in Asia. In both situations the leadership principle was the same: so long as a charismatic individual is leading the travels the time spent together is seen as a wonderful crusade. When the charismatic individual leaves, the travelers begin to quarrel and the fun ends. Both books provide very interesting insights into human nature."
3,A moralistic Tale,"I must admit I was somewhat disappointed with this short book. It seemed to all lead up to Hesse's message regarding the responsibility of the self to accept the responsibility of guiding others and that pure followers are doomed to disappear. One only imagines that Hesse had an idea, almost like a dream, where a couple sentences summarizes an array of experiences whereby one feels like he has been through the entire journey with him yet cannot recall details. Although at times interesting, this book seems to be Hesse's period of contemplation before undertaking The Glass Bead Game."
4,Another take on esoteric knowledge,"This is the account of a novice in an esoteric, international and timeless group (the League) of his failed journey to the East (the successful religious quest). He initially writes with hesitation, uncertain that the League still exists, unwilling to break its code of silence, and confused by the incompleteness of his own memory. As his writing stalls, he recognizes the similarity of his problem with that of a survivor of the World War - how to describe experiences outside the experience of the normal reader. He then seeks out an apparent deserter (Leo) from the quest.Your appreciation for this novel would be enhanced if you (as opposed to myself) were a strong believer in a long esoteric tradition. Without such a belief, you will still find yourself intrigued by Hesse's grasp of human nature."
2,Same theme as Demian But with less force.,"An excellent book, but the same idea is put forth in Hesse's ""Demian"" with much greater force."
4,A GREAT NOVEL FOR A LEADERSHIP COURSE,"Every college course or business seminar or church retreat on the theme of leadership should include 2 or 3 important novels as required reading--or at least for review by the class instructor. This is a wondrful book on servant leadership that fits wonderfully into a Christian context (coming from the author's missionary family heritage). The message is as old as Jesus. I wish I had known of the book when I taught my leadrship course at Calvin Theological seminary, where there was little evidence of servant leadership in the school's administration (""My Calvin Seminary Story""). I'm out of a teaching job, but my next published book is on the topic of leadership--or, if you will, ""anti-leadersip,"" and this novel will find its way into that book."
4,A Good Read but not Hesse's Best,"This is a good short read about self-awareness, hope, Art, and the consequences of self-willed despair. It's also a neat 'road' tale and a nostalgic look at mystical fellowship. I, too, came to it from Wolfe's Electric_Koolaid_Acid _Test! Interestingly, though, I've run across the same theme repeated in the experience of a lot of seekers after Truth."
5,Awesome. The British are coming!!! The British are coming!!!,I love this album. I hope one day that this woman will make her way over to the U.S. Im trying to wonder why Simon Cowell is not trying to Endorse this woman. Heck she's from his country. but I love. If she ever came to the US she would be dangerous.Please refer to my other review for additional comments about her other album.
4,scathing poetic realism from a woman's perspective,"Many will find Erica Jong's writing shocking. This little book of poetry is no exception. The vantagepoint is wholly feminine, and not entirely happy. Deals primarily with the agonies of relationships, including many sexualized references. Wives, housewives, and rejected lovers will all find words to ponder here.Some of the poems also address Jong's poetic predecessor's, such as Pablo Neruda, Colette, and Mary Shelley, and these little poems may probably cause you to re-evaluate the original authors in light of Jong's unique viewpoint. Sometimes scathing realism. Graphic language."
2,Way to short,I thought when I was buying this shirt that it was going to be the best bang for my buck but when I got it in the mail I was suprised and very disapointed.1.the bottom is only serged and it worries me that if I throw it in the washer its going to come undone. Plus it comes down to maybe your hip bone or even a bit higher.2.Just not worth paying 13 bucks for.In the end its better to go to an actually army navy surplus store and buy shirts there.
4,Not too bad,"Overall, not bad. It does have a minor stability issue. The shuttle seems to ""tumble"" a little when hit (similar to the tumble you get when you hit the shuttle with the racket frame). It doesn't seem to affect it's trajectory, but you can definitely see it. Not too big of issue, but can make short serving and net play a bit unpredictable.The shuttles sure last tho. I used 1 shuttle for 5 set yesterday and at the end, it is still playable. Enough that I shoved it back into the tube for next time. In fact, the ""tumbling"" issue seemed to disappear after the shuttle is worn.I will have to see how the other 2 tubes (I got 3) fare before I decide to get more or not."
2,Not So Good -,"I am an intermediate club player in Los Angeles, this birdie last less than 1 game, if play softly it may last up to 1 game. It can't handle smash very well, all feathers tend to fall off after a few smashes, mine slowed down after a few hits, doesn't fly as well. Few may tumble a bit, NOT ALL!!!!."
3,Reasonable quality for the money,"These birds are cheap and for a good reason. They are not consistent and many of them are very, very slow straight out of the box. Durability is average; flight stability is OK, I suppose. They are OK for club play if you don't mind breaking some feathers in to speed them up a bit. I may buy more but would probably prefer Victor or Yang Yang."
3,A little light,I play badminton outdoors so we have winds out there.We play 1 hr each day and it cost me one shuttlecocks per two days...It's not that durable and it's kinda light so we had to put more force in n therefore it gets destructed too soon....
2,Won't last very long,"After going through 2 cans of this shuttlecock, I liked the flight performance when new, but the durability is unacceptable. The feathers easily breaks after a few hard hits. You will need about 2-3 of them for just one game. Now, I only use them for warm-up practice. For game plays, I need to use something else. Sorry, but I would not buy this brand again!"
3,GOGO BS01 shuttlecocks,"I agreee with most low reviews.. I bought about 10 dozen. They tend to break after 2-3 smashes, so I had to steam them which made them decent... almost mandatory for these birds. A few would last 8 points, but very inconsistent. A few will have slight wobble in flight (1 out of a dozen, but low intermediates won't notice). Feathers are medium-thin thickness. Most advanced players (those that have played tournaments) won't play with them at all. Ok for beginners to almost high intermediate. Flight is ok, I'd say around B,B+. Durability B-,C+. Consistency B-.Good for the price, good for warm ups, but can be frustrating for more advanced players. I don't mind hitting with them for most casual-competitive games, but would need a more solid feel and stable flight in high intermediate games - games that have a couple consistent jump smashes."
4,The Search for Amelia Earhart,"This classic published in 1966 is a must read for any serious student of the Earhart mystery. Goerner, who died in 1994 was a meticulous investigator who devoted over 30 years to this research. He later concluded that Earhart was not on a military mission, but that she and Noonan had come down on some islets southeast of Howland Island and were picked up by the Japanese and taken to Saipan."
3,Works outside...,"I bought this to deter strays from bugging my cat at the window. I live in a basement apartment so strays outside are at eye level with my cat when he perches at the window. It drives my cat nuts. I tried powders, crystals...this spray seemed to work. You have to keep applying it. It wears off after a few days. BUT I sprayed it on the corners of my couches to try and prevent my cat from scratching and it had no effect whatsoever."
3,Works for the most part,"Contrary to the other review, this product does work for me. I use it to spray areas on my patio that I don't want my cat bring his kills to. My cat hates the smell and avoids the area (and me if it gets on my hand). BUT, it wears off quickly, so it has to be reapplied every few days (until the cat is trained). The rating is due to this fact."
1,Did not perform as expected,This product didn't keep cats away I think they liked it. Won't ever consider buying again. Beware if you intend to purchase.
2,Eh...,"It kept my dog away....but it was for the cats. They stayed away initially (I mean like, 10 minutes) but then had no qualms walking right over the sprayed surface"
2,wow it smells not good.,it works great on humans for certain..... . . . . . . . . . . . . .not worth much on felines however
