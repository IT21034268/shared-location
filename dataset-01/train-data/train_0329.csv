5,The Best Movie is The Best Man!,"this film captured the essence of another dimension of african-american culture. malcolm lee brought the images of educated, successful young black people to the forefront and i am so grateful. the characters were very indicative of my college friends and the storyline was superbly written and executed by the most talented black actors in the business. terrance howard's character stole the show :) but everyone gave 150% and i'm glad the story was able to be told before a global audience. it is one of the best films ever made!"
3,DVD case was yellowed,"I understand this item i ordered was in 'good' condition, and it was. The DVD played fine with no problems. i guess i was expecting the DVD to look newer than it did. it appeared to be an old used library DVD copy. I suppose it was worth the $5 though."
2,Bad copy,"My copy of Pioneers and Makers of Arkansas was very poorly done. There were several repeated pages, blurred pages, and smugged pages.Even though the reprinters of this 1908 work admit the errors, I was not aware that it contained so many when I purchased it.The information that was readable (almost all of the book) was wonderful."
3,no title,"If you want to learn about the 1921 state of public affairs in Europe, this is a quite remarkable book! It is also a fairly interesting tale of the estrangement of a young war veteran from his aristocratic modern young wife. Written very turgidly, however, with an almost laughable ending. Would make a great Masterpiece Theatre series."
3,"Not Cool, Thumbs Down","Seems like a great deal, BUT the board sucks. It is not durable, bends and will break easily. The only durable thing is the helmet. The wheels are also very cheap, they are plastic and will not give much speed. This is more of a 8-12 year old, 120-140lbs. kid skateboard because of its durability and small pad size."
2,hard to read,If you have not seen the movies the author writes about the book is hard to understand. It was hard to read and I found it quite boring.
3,Not so Bright,The design on the glasses is pretty but the pictures on the net show them very colorful. The reason I bought these is because of the color. When I opend the box you could barely tell that they were colored glasses. I was very disappointed with that. Other than the color they are nice glasses.
1,Dreadful!,Strathern's book simply reproduces the ignorant prejudices against Hegel that have bedevilled Anglo-American philosophy. Who should read this book- anyone who wants to make a few dismissive remarks about Hegel in order to give the appearance of learning at a cocktail party. Who should not read this book- anyone who might want to learn something from Hegel.
1,It deserves less than one star,"It would be ridiculous to recommend this book to anyone, it's about the worst introduction to Hegel one can imagine. The author clearly has no understanding of Hegel and lacks entirely any sympathy for the subject he is writing about. The result is a mucky hodgepodge of all the banal stereotypes and biases that have existed on Hegel in Anglo-American literature. It would be like a German writing a book on Thomas Jefferson and focusing on the fact that he was a slave-owning plantation owner. After encountering this book I questioned the quality of all the books in this ""...in 90 Minutes"" series, and have since stayed away from them. The Wikipedia entry on Hegel is far superior to this book as a general introduction, and its free."
4,Great gift.,The only problem u have with. this gift is that the pieces can be made to fit the different holes when turned at different angles. The toy is well made though and my children like it
3,Paint job lacking,"This arrived still in plastic but one corner of the Ark was cracked and the paint was peeling. The toy itself is neat but in retrospect probably too young for may almost three year old daughter. She hasn't played with it much other than to push it around on the carpet which she could do with a cheaper, lighter toy. : )"
5,Great quality,Bought this for all my nieces for Christmas. they love the shape sorting but also the animals can go in the boat. Perfect for pretend play.
1,DOES NOT WORTH MONEY!!!,"I don't see anything learning in this toy. Does not worth these money. The shape of the windows (holes) in the sides do not allow to hold puzzles in place, all of them fall down inside. Nothing special, just waste of money"
1,Disappointed,The Ark fell apart when it was used. Had to glue it back together. It is not very well made.
3,A bit disappointing,I ordered for my granddaughter and I was a bit disappointed. The door snaps shut quite hard and could hurt her. Also the shape sorter doesn't really work--the animals can be put in through most of the holes sideways.It is nice to have a Noah's ark toy and be able to talk about the Bible story and to have two of each animal plus Noah & his wife.I have been very please with other Melissa & Doug toys that we have purchased for our granddaughter.
4,"NOT s shape sorter, but a quality toy for imaginative play","My kids teased me because they thought this was the worst puzzle ever, since any of the shapes went into any of the holes. But that isn't why I chose it for my grand-daughter. I love wooden toys, and was surprised at the quality of this one. When I went to visit, we played with Noah and the animals, marching them all over the living room, then up the ramp to the ark.No, it is NOT a shape sorter, as advertised, but if your little one (mine was 18 mos at the time) has some imagination, it can be a fun toy. For those kids who want toys that buzz and beep and spin and move, it would probably be a bust.This ark will last a LONG time, and can be passed down to siblings, then other friends and relatives. I would DEFINITELY buy it again, if I had it to do over."
3,"Fun toy, but not really a shape sorter","The ark & animals are very colorful and my 20 month old son loves playing with the animals and naming them.The only problem is this really is NOT a shape sorter as the animals can be put in nearly any hole just by tipping them sideways. My son rarely puts them in the ""right"" hole as it is so easy just to put them all in one of the holes on the top. When we do try to put them in the ""right"" hole it is a challenge to get them in right as there really is no good way for little fingers to hold onto them and put them squarely in the hole.Overall, great toy, but do not buy it if you are really looking for a shape sorter."
1,No Motor Skill Value - Don't Waste Your Money,"This one can be entitled: ""Melissa & Doug, what were you thinking?!"" Except, obviously, my mother-in-law gave them $[...] for this complete waste of space on the toy shelf. Because the individual ark characters are so thin, and vary in size so greatly, most of the pieces can just be shoved into any available hole. Thus, this ""shape-sorter"" is no shape sorter at all. Just find a hole big enough, turn the piece on its side, and it drops right in. The animal pictures are only painted on one side of the character - the other side is blank. If you want a toy that builds your child's fine motor and problem solving skills, this is not the toy for you. If you just want an ark to do some Bible-knowledge building, I suppose this would work, but for my money, I'd say there are better options out there."
5,Great toy,"This is a great toy. It's durable and a great learning toy. But it's not great for my almost 3 yr. old granddaughter with Down Syndrom. When the animals are held sideways they can be slipped into any of the shaped holes. It did not take long for her to figure this out. She has a great time putting the animals in and taking them out - just not into the intended slots! Oh well, she is enjoying playing with Noah's Ark."
3,Good,The book is in good form although its content fell short of what I expected. The packaging was equally good.
5,cheap fix!!!!!,"Have a PSP 1000 series and the joystick started to stray in games. It was really annoying, I bought this and it cleared it right up, runs like new. Apparently a dirty lens can have that effect. Anyways great product and recommend it to anyone with a PSP."
3,Optical Lens Cleaner,"I ordered this for the purpose of cleaning my daughters PSP, but i cannot tell if it's running or not, it's very quiet. Although i know it's doing what it's supposed to :)"
1,Scary Movie 4,I don`t really hate it. I NEVER got it. Ordered the same time as Scary Movie 3.5. which I received in a few days. It`s been over a month and I don`t know where the hell it is. I`ve already paid for it.
2,"Weak, time to put an end to it","There were a couple of places that made me giggle, but for the most part it just had old and/or weak jokes and stuff that really didn't make me laugh. I thought the previous one was somewhat funnier."
2,Not funny.,"Almost every joke in this movie was predictable or just really really lame. Nothing new really, same old jokes we've seen in other movies..... I actually walked out with 15 minutes left of the movie because I just didnt care how they were going to sum up the idiotic plot. Very few of the cast returned.... I think this will be the last scary movie."
1,got tired fast,"on the real aside from the Opening with Shaq&Dr Phil which was funny,but didn't last long enough&the Anthony Anderson Brokeback Mountain take, there wasn't much to this film. this film went into the same cliches&got real tired real fast. thought it might be at least ok,but it wasn't even that much. this series has gone on way too long if you ask me."
1,OH please,Enough is Enough already. There is such a thing as beating a good thing to death. PLEASE PUT ThESE to REST.............. Only a Moron would watch it.......
1,Quite possibly the worst film of the year,"There is a funny opening and I was expecting it to be a good film at least like Scary Movie 1 or 3.....it wasn't. It was not only UNfunny but if you are in a good mood, this film will throw water on it. Just when I was going to walk out, it ended. I truly hope that I never see this again. In fact, I would rather read a dictionary."
1,Save your money....................,I just recently purchased this movie on Amazon and trust me save your money. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I was hoping that keeping with tradition of the past scary movie sequels this would be funny. It took everyhting in me to sit through it.
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If your idea of humor is people hitting their head on things, this movie is for you; if you like actual satire (or humor, if it comes to that) then please look elsewhere."
3,"""number 4""","I thought this 4th installment was probably the funniest ones in my opinion and the least ""dirtiest"" one out of all of them.What made this movie an on going laughing film was1. the japanese talking grudge2. the ""messed up"" faces from the grudge's curse3. the on going pharting in the village4. the great special stars in the SAWWhile i was watching this movie, i would laugh for a very long time, a long pause, then laugh again, pause then so on....Just see it."
2,Where are the laughs?,The first Scary Movie was really very funny. It really hit the mark and I thought the formula would be easy to follow with subsequent sequels. But thats not been the case. The second Scary Movie was painfully bad. Just terrible with no laughs at all. The third was slightly better but still disappointing. Now the fourth installment has been released and is another disppointmeent. I think its safe to say that the series is horribly stale and the Scary Movie franchise should be put out of its misery.
2,Bad,"Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil make an early appearance in this comedy that sees trying to stop from an alien invasion. I thought it was bad, but not horrible."
1,Formalistic comedy that doesn't always work,some of the gags were so bad that I looked away from the screen and groaned. Taking long bathroom breaks was the best way to cope with this movie.
5,The Grudge against The Village in the War Of The Worlds that Saw 2 Million Dollar Babies on Brokeback Mountain.,"I remember seeing SM4 on opening day. My friends and I loved it! Then I bought it on the day it came out...unrated. It was still funny! SM4 Is a masterpiece.STORY: CIndy Campbell goes to look for a caretaking job. Her first job is at the Grudge House. She meets a man named Tom Ryan, and Cindy comes back! When she discovers the ""grudge kid"", and an alien attack. Cindy and Brenda (who has come back) discover a village, and there, they are safe...until the tri-Pods attack again!THOUGHTS: HI-FU[KING-LARIOUS! I love the SAW 2 spoof near the end.So see it!EDIT: 0/2 ppl found the review elpful. WHY! I wrote you a long and amusing review. Stupid haters."
5,DR. PHIL TOLD THE TRUTH IN THIS MOVIE!!!!!,"In the oepning sequence of Scary Movie 4, Shaq and Dr. Phil are trappe in a bathroom. Dr. Phil admits that hes not a good doctor and he just tells people to get real. This is the truth. Dr. Phil does not give good advice at all!"
1,SCARY MOVIE 4,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS....STUPID, STUPID, STUPID....THEY TOOK WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD MOVIE AND RUINED IT WITH THE STUPIDEST OF THINGS....LIKE THE GIANT IPOD....CMON....NOT EVEN FUNNY....TO ME NOT WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY OR RENT...."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers and say that this indeed is not the best one of the Scary Movies.Scary Movie 4, following in the footsteps of its predecessors, is a parody of several films including War of the Worlds, The Village, Million Dollar Baby, and the funniest of all... Brokeback Mountain!It is a humorous movie... at times. The casting is good, though some of the dialogues could have been better. What it comes down to is that they could have worked on the humor much more.Overall, it is a film worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!"
3,Scary movie 4 - kind of dissapointing,"Oh my God, I was waiting for this movie for a while. I bought it right away, and was so excited to get back home and watch it. And there it was. As much as I love the silly comedies, this was just a big dissapointment. My wife fell asleep, but I watched to the end. Don't get me wrong, I would still watch it, but I was expecting something more innovative. You could actually predict everything over there. At one point I thought that someone combine the funniest scenes from different movies, and replaced the actors - that's it. As much as I liked the 3 other parts, and as much as each part was funniest than the precious, this one is dissapointing. Anyway - watch it and you will see what I am talking about. Good luck"
2,Previews outshine the movie.,"The funny segments in the previews drew me to the theater, but I would have been better off watching the previews over and over because those were basically the only funny parts. There were some additional comic moments, but as a whole, the film was disappointing. In fact, I've never seen the other Scary Movie spoofs, and, after this one, I'm not going to try."
2,What's Scary is That They're Making a 5th Film,"I hate that since most people have to see a movie before they'll deem it awful, movie studios will see that as it being profitable and crank out another one. Lord help us all. This movie was boring, and if anything, far too long. The Wayans brothers did such a good job with the first two films, but whoever has taken over for 3-4 has completely gotten the movies off track. When the Wayans were in charge, the movies were crude, disgusting, and laugh out loud funny. Now the films are stupid, childish, and completely unfunny. How can anyone find someone getting hit and knocked down funny when it happens 5 times in a row? Seriously people, it's not funny at all. It's like a group of over zealous 4th graders got together and wrote a movie script and this is what happened. The jokes are all 4th grade mentality - unfunny, uninspired, and completely unaware that no one, besides them, are getting any joy out of them."
4,'Mitsubishi Kimono Saki Fujitsu',"With Good Friday off, my boyfriend and I headed to the local mega-plex for a matinee show (still $6.50!) for Scary Movie 4. It was laugh-out-loud funny! Leslie Nielsen still has his comic timing after all these years and turns in a brave performance, nudity and all. Chris Elliot is hilarious as the 'Village' idiot and Bierko's spin on Tom Cruise's couch antics is spot on! Yeah, so there's some potty humor, get over it! See this movie for some good gut chuckles - and don't forget your nuts!"
4,Much Better than the 3rd movie,"i have to say that i went into watching this movie with low expectations because of the 3rd movie being a bit lame, but i loved it they improved so much from the last one, you should watch it, its nice and light comedy that you dont have to take too seriously,"
2,More slapstick than satire,"The ""Scary Movie"" series was always good for a laugh, but after three sequels the writers and creative directors seem to have worn out the plot. Although Scary Movie 4 has some good gags, overall it is very predictable and almost boring. Better to rent this one, instead of buying it."
3,Bring On the Funny,"It's almost disturbing that this movie looks as good as it does on HD DVD. It's one of the best looking movies in my collection.The movie itself is silly, stupid, funny, and a great pick me up for a gloomy day. Exactly as it should be."
4,My Bowels Have Stopped...Why!!!,"The Scary Movie series always does a great job at joking around with the horror movies of the year, and it still hasn't failed to make me laugh. If you liked the first three, then you will also like this movie as well. You know it's a cool movie is Mike Tyson is on the movie spoofing his infamous biting the ear scene. This is the best series since Hot Shots and really hope that this series contiues, just non stop laughs the entire time"
2,Cornball Sophmoric Parody,"I actually founds some parts of this film amusing. I'm a big ""war of the world's"" fan, so when I saw this film was going to spoof it, I checked it out. Yeah, I'm not a fan of the potty humor (the scene with the old woman getting the sponge bath), or homophobic jokes (Brokeback Mountain parody), some of this film had some amusing bits. Tom on the Winfrey show. The Michael Jackson 'cameo' when the Tripods are attacking, the scene where ""Tom"" is trying to take the minivan.Other scenes were just lame. (The beginning Saw scene), The scene in the Village.I really can't see rating this film any more than 2 stars. It was Trash TV. But some of the scenes were well done, and I thought the actors: particularly the Tom character and his daughter (dead ringer for the kid in the actual movie), did an excellent job.Recommend this film for adults only. Too much sex and potty humor for the kiddies."
3,"Yes, they made yet another one...","I think I must be the only one who hated `Scary Movie 3', so even though this film was no where near as clever or even as funny as 1 or 2, I felt it surpassed 3 with flying colors. That said, the film still lacks a lot compared to the first two films, the first in particular. Spoofing horror films like `The Grudge' `Saw' and the not so horrorish `The Village' and `War of the Worlds', `Scary Movie 4' has a lot of good source material. What irritates me to no end is the impulse to spoof dramatic films with no horror merit, like `Brokeback Mountain' and `Million Dollar Baby', movies that really have no place in a `Scary Movie', but that's just my opinion...although I will say that the scariest, and downright funniest part of this movie is the end where Craig Bierko reenacts Tom Cruise's Oprah couch incident. Priceless!"
2,SCARY MOVIE BACKFIRES!! :{,"As good and funny as the third one was, this one just blew. The movie itself was o.k. It had very little funny parts. But the storyline. TERRIBLE. The movie was too short, the storyline tanked and it was hardly funny.It was about Cindy who lost her husband in a (Million Dollar Baby) accident moves to a new town(WAR OF THE WORLDS) into a new house(THE GRUDGE)to see new people. She gets kidnapped(SAW), finds a new town(THE VILLAGE) and tries to escape aliens. But brings no comedy out of this one.I do recommend you to see it, but I must warn you. If you are a big scary movie fan like I am. You will be somewhat disappointed."
2,Nothing Personal Cindy...,"Unlike the first three movies this one is not laughable. I could describe this movie as a follow-up of the third film with some references of the last film and cameos of the people that were in the last movie.The movie is making fun of ""The Grudge"" and ""War of the Worlds"". Unlike the third movie you will NOT laugh in this movie you will rarely find something to laugh at because all of the ""jokes"" they throw in feels rushed by the directors and the producers. Also some of them are cheesy or copycat of the first films. I didn't find it funny at all. Some of them are exaggerated as well just to make you ""laugh"" but I can say that I liked Anna Farris's performance is as good as the first three films and the come back of Brenda is funny. But the movie is not laughable you will see this movie as a cheap comedy you better rent the first three films because this one is not even close.Make yourself a favour and don't even rent it ok?"
2,This movie sucked.,"Just saw this in the theatre a couple of days ago, and this was a waste of my time and 99 cents.This movie is not very funny at all. As others have already mentioned, everything just appeared rushed. The jokes weren't that funny and it seems that all that the movie focused one was trying to gross out the audience more than trying to make them laugh. When something funny DID happen it was like everyone else in the in audience was waiting on someone else to laugh first. It appeared everyone felt uncomfortable being in the theatre; scared to laugh at jokes that really weren't that funny.The storyline made no sense, it just jumped around all over the place and was very hard to follow. You don't expect much of a storyline in these types of movies anyway, but in any case they should be at least easy to follow...this movie wasn't.This movie was clearly rushed and not very funny at all. I hope they don't make any more Scary Movies after this garbage."
3,At least it was better than the Scary Movie 3,"I couldn't believe that they actually came out with a Scary Movie 4, after the Horror that scary movie 3 was. I do like the the first two in the series, but the third fell so flat. This edition actually gained some entertainment back. Playing on War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, The Villiage, and Saw, this movie actually seemed funny again. Still not like the first two, but ok. Actually, the best sequence was at the beginning with Dr. Phil and Shaq. Funny parts, not as overly done as number 3, but some parts were (the boat yard scene? why the monkeys?). So, This is a decent rental, but I just don't find the urge to buy this edition. They should have stopped at the first two. Again, the loss of the Wayne's brothers hurt the overall film."
3,Silly but enjoyable,Ok this movie was stupid but it's supose to be stupid. I hated number 3 and enjoyed the first 2 and this one was surprisingly good. I really like Anna Fairs she's enjoyable tow atcha dn she's funny. There are funny moments which make this film enjoyable. There are ltos of stupid parts that arnt funny but overall I enjoyed it.
4,Pink Marble Labret,"I really liked the color, and the price was great. The only thing I thought that the clear swirl would be even all around. Mine is only off to one side. I don't know if it's was made to be like that or if they all look different. For the price you can't really complain though."
1,Too basic and unorganized,"I wanted help on how I could more efficiently clean my house. This was not the right video for that. It appears to be designed as instruction for a maid, including tips on closing the shower door so things look nice. If you want a more organized approach to house cleaning, complete with a list of tools and products you will need, you would be better off if you can find an old copy at your local library of ""How to Clean Your House in Two Hours."" That video lays out a cleaning strategy for each room and aggressive tips for cleaning well and quickly."
4,Good Movie,"I enjoyed the movie,but, i wish they had explaned more of why Michelle was so overprotective over her son.But, for me, its rated PG-13, there was language not just by some of the adults, but the kids as well. But, with that being said, i did enjoy the movie, but, its in the spirit of Badnews Bears and Mighty Ducks, so, it would be better for older kids."
4,Milford,"My wife and myself enjoyed the movie for it's storyline and acting. It is an enjoyable good family movie. Most of the movie was filmed in the small town we live in. So, it was also very nice to see the store fronts, parks, and streets in our village of Milford, Michigan."
4,A terrifying vision of the future,"In Michael In Hell, Dennis Latham takes us on a ride into a future of darkness and terror, laced with enough reality to make it believeable. Our hero, or anti-hero, Michael is a Vietnam Veteran on a mission to rid the world of ""scumbags"". In his pursuit of justice he survives tougher battles than he had faced in Vietnam, but manages to always come out on top.Though a little preachy in places on the plight of disabled veterans, Mr. Latham had served his country honorably in Vietnam, was wounded and a decorated Marine. I'd say he's entitled to that. Over all the book was quiet fun to read and the excitement level never slowed down."
3,The full Quijote,"I was pleased to find the full length recording of this ballet that is rarely seen in its entirety. I enjoyed the recording, however, I found the orchestra less than full-bodied, especially during the Grand Pas de Deux towards the end of the CD. It seemed a little tinny, a little too fragile during Kitri's variation, which does not suit her passionate, voluptuous nature. Aside from these drawbacks, I found the music very entertaining. I am still waiting for a full length version by a more robust orchestra, but in the meantime, this Don Quijote recording will do."
5,A very entertaining movie,"I was just relaxing one sunday afternoon with my brother when we caught this on SciFi channel and when it was over we were very impressed with this movie. I noticed some scenes that looked like they were going to be used in another movie that I own that was made one year after this was made (I am refering to Jurassic Park II: The Lost World). I would call Rob Cohen A Steven Speilbeg clone. The bottom line is that this is a great movie, buy it."
5,Something about Dragon movies,This move was bought to replace one that simply disappeared from my house. ....................... ........................... ........................ ............................. ........................... .............................. .......................
5,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"This is one of the best films that have been made. It's about a knight who is training a young prince to become a king. When the prince's father die he is to become king. That day comes, but unfortunetly he is wounded in battle. The knight, Bowen takes him to a dragon to heal him. The dragon (named Draco) does and makes the boy promise never to be evil like his father. This innocent prince then becomes a blood-thirsty king. Bowen gets angry thinking it is the dragons fault. He goes on a spree killing dragons and later realizes that it isn't the dragons fault. He then teams up with Draco the Dragon to put the king out of power. The movie is sad and very touching. I almost cried at the end and so will most of you. The dragon looks real and the music is stunning. Dennis Qauid, Sean Connery, and Pete Postelthwait are dynamite in this movie. Each of them are at truly top notch perfomences."
3,"Great Special Effects and Video, Thin Story","Dragonheart gets an extra star due to the great Dolby Digital Soundtrack and quality of the Video on DVD. But as a movie its lacking, the plot is thin and unsatisfying and the acting by Dennis Quaid is pretty hilarious at times. Besides the fine Soundtrack and Video it would be a decent TV movie, i wouldnt go out of my way to watch it though."
4,"Highly Enjoyable, But Missing....Something","This movie is an excellent example of what CGI can do for a fantasy/sci-fi movie-and getting Sean Connery to do Draco's voice makes it that much more believable(and commanding)! Dennis Quaid's performance was top-notch; I've always thought he was a highly underrated actor, and this role gave him a chance to do something out of the mainstream. Unfortunately, the movie just didn't hit all the right places it should've. I learned recently that is was to have a much darker, more dramatic tone, and I honestly think it would've been that much more believable for it. Granted, the ending was powerful and touching(Draco's plea to Bowen to sacrifice his life to defeat Einon was heartbreaking), but the rest of the movie, had it had that kind of dramatic power, would have made it a much more engaging experience. Overall, though, a very enjoyable and otherwise excellent movie!"
3,Ok movie,"Dragonheart isnt a bad movie,but its not that good either.For starters,Could someone tell me why they rated it pg-13?there was no cussing,And no that much blood/gore/violence.I think it should have been rated pg but anyway....I think its at least worth a rental"
5,A Knights and Dragon Fantasy adventure with DTS,"The film ""Dragonheart"" is a whimsical adventure well acted with outstanding special effects. The DTS format makes the experience that much greater. For anyone interested in fun films with top of the line sound ...this is the movie to get."
2,ARRRGGG!!!,I thought this movie would be good... but when i saw it....... well let's just say they easily could've improved the story. It was one of the WORST stories i've ever seem!!! that's why i gave it such a low rating.... the graphics in it were awesome (loved the dragons!!!!) but overall... let's face it.. the movie sucked!!
2,"Decent, not good","I didn't enjoy this at all the first few times I saw this. Although I like Quaid and Connery, their performances (really, the way the characters were written) were cheesy and overdone. The plot was bad and predictable, but the effects, namely Draco, were well done. the only reason I've watched this more than once is Jason Isaacs. His performance as Lord Felton, though forgettable due to the extremely small role of the character who could really be left out, is amazing. I didn't recognize him until I knew that he was in it, and it is totally different from any of his other roles. He's pathetic really, with the high voice, sleazy smile, and general creepiness. If you want to see a brilliant performance, watch for Isaacs-he provides the only grade A character."
1,Think All Dogs go to Heaven,"After watching this movie once some years ago, I developed a dislike for it. I cried too many time seeing that movie - too much like All Dogs Go to Heaven and Old Yeller in which an animal gave it life to protect a human. Yes for all its intellection and wits, the dragon is treated much like an animal - the kind that guards its human from dangers - after all, the dragon gave its heart to a sick noble then just stood there until the hero of the movie kill the noble for his evil deeds and die along with the evil noble instead of killing the noble himself."
1,This DTS disk didn't work in DTS mode.,"After several attempts, this disk only plays in 2 channel stereo. The DTS mode does not work. I've checked with others that have purchased and they two have the same problem. I returned it."
3,An entertaining film.,"This movie is rated PG13 for Violence and Sexual Content. Considering the amount of violence, it could have been rated R but it would have missed its target audience. This movie is mainly about killing although the cute and possibly wise quotes raise it to a loftier height.That said and keeping it in mind, it can be fun entertainment for young teenagers and pre-teens with plenty of action but perhaps a little too silly for mature adults due to the style of the comic relief. This is a fantasy film set in a mystical period between medieval and renaissance, and contains a talking dragon.The country scenes are wonderful and so are the special effects, especially that of the dragon and the interaction between live and computer generated effects. Sean Connery's voice for the dragon is a perfect fit. This movie keeps the pace moving smartly and the emotional scenes short. It's an entertaining film."
4,a really good movie,Dragonheart was one of those movies I put off seeing because I didn't think I would like it. Finally I convinced myself to give it a try and I must say I quite enjoyed it. The story is complex but not confusing. The use of CGI effects for Draco are exceptionally good. The actors are well cast. I especially enjoyed Dina Meyers performance as Kara. She was a very good strong female character that many movies like this lack. All in all a great movie for any age and any person.
4,DragonHeart -DTS,"An excellent movie, alot of fun for the kids. I seen this movie in the theater with my wife and kids and we loved it. It has the right mix of drama and humor. Never too dull and never too scary, my youngest absolutely loved Draco. When I got my DVD player it was my first choice because of the DTS encoded sound, this brought the sounds of battle and the beating wings of Draco the dragon into our home just like what we experienced sitting in the theater. Great movie for the family!"
5,Great Movie and sound!,"Dragonheat is one great movie with spectacular visual effects. The sound on the dvd version is also flawless, one example is the dragon, when it flys around Bowen you actually hear him traveling speaker to speaker, a nice touch. The movie is very well done, the music also is not a let down, a great score. A highly reccomended film!"
4,Great adventures in a magic world!,"Esta película no es mas que una bonita historia de fantasía y aventuras, que deja un muy buen sabor de boca a todo aquel que le guste soñar con criaturas salvajes,héroes,espadas,batallas,brujería,buenos y malos...Es cierto que la presencia del dragón perfectamente recreada, atraiga más al público, pero lo que se debe tener más en cuenta son los ideales plasmados(honor,bondad,justicia,amistad,amor,valentía...), los cuales forman positivamente a la persona. Este moderno largometraje se abstiene de sexo duro y de violencia extrema, dos temas totalmrnte innecesarios en una historia que invita a tener buena personalidad."
4,VERY COOL MOVIE!,GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS.VERY GOOD FLICK.THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE MOVIE IS VERY GOOD.THERE'S ALOT OF ACTION AND FIGHTS WITH DRAGONS.THE DRAGON LOOKS AS IF IT WAS REAL.THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE WON AWARDS.THE ACTING IS SO PROFESSIONAL.BUY IT.
4,Fun movie!,"Not the greatest movie ever, but still a good movie for the fantasy genre. Great for a lazy afternoon."
3,"Good Movie But,","DRAGONSLAYER far superior in many ways. As other reviewers have said, not for the squeamish or very young children, but a good old-fashioned fairy tale (in the truest sense!) with some good special effects, music and fine acting."
3,not well written,"For the first half of movie, I thought they were intentionally never going to show the dragon. I think they were saving money on CGs. They started showing it more the last half. The CGs are okay at this point, especially for the era. The main problem is that it is not well written. We made fun of it the whole way through, which is kind of fun it its own right. Get it for that."
5,An Excellent Story,"If you're a Dragon lover, you'll love this movie. Good for the whole family. An excellent story of a Dragon slayer who befriends that which he is trying to get rid of, a Dragon. The Dragon, Draco, and Bowen, come up with a scheme to make money. But, there is fear in Bowen's heart when he discovers that his Dragon friend is sharing half his heart with the power hungry King. The Dragon design is awesome. If there was ever any speculation as to what a Dragon looks like, this movie ended it. This is my favorite movie ever. Visit... for more info on Dragons!!"
3,"Thought provoking, fanciful, throughly enjoyable","My son, who is 3 1/2, is totally in love with Draco and watches him constantly. I have seen this movie a thousand times, and I still cry at the end."
3,Bad lead actor,Movie would have been 4-5 stars with a different lead. Quaid couldn't hold his accent and wasn't believable. Other actors were good.
3,"DTS ONLY, nothing more","I enjoyed this movie, but unless you really love DTS and have a player specifically designed for it, buy the collector's edition of this movie. The DTS version has nothing extra; no languages, no subtitles, no menu at all, except to chose DTS or 5.1 surround. The DTS selection will not work on my Zenith machine, although other DTS disks I have do. Once you start the movie, you cannot get back to the menu to change the sound choice."
4,Good fantasy movie,"This is a good movie about a knight (Bowen) who fights dragons. In this movie dragons are seen as being Godlike. When a young prince is dying the people ask a dragon (Draco) to save him. Draco reluctantly gives him a piece of his heart to save his life. Draco makes the prince swear that he will not be like his father. Draco was reluctant because he did detect some evil in the boy. When the boy turns out to be bad like his father Bowen, played by Dennis Quaid, blames the dragon and swears to kill all dragon's. Draco then becomes the last surving dragon. Draco tells Bowen that his heart did not corrupt the boy and that the evil was in him. Bowen has to kill Draco because as long as he is alive the prince cannot die.This is a simple story of good vs evil. Fantasy movies tend to be mindless bloodbaths. For a fantasy movie it is quite good."
5,Awsome Movie,"A very great movie! Incredible graphics, good storyline, good actors (except for the lack of British accents, but I don't really care at all) and I read another review where the heading is ""I Want A Pet Draco"". Heh, I agree, Draco is a awsome and would be great if he were real =D Oh, and one character in the movie (brother Gilbert) is a hilarious Bad A"
1,"Get their album, Lefty...","I bought their album, Lefty, whenever it was out in the late 90s. Its still one of my most favorite albums from the area. The music, the lyrics, the harmonies, the whole album is awesome. Its a shame this one doesn't even touch the greatness of that one. Most Pushmonkey fans will probably be upset with what I said and I'm sure seeing them live would make you enjoy it more. I recommend giving that album a listen first."
2,Quote for Never Die Alone,"Theres ups and downs in this movie. To me mostly downs.When I first seen it in theaters i loved it. So when Igot the DVD ,iloved it.3 months pass i get sick of it.For 3 reasons First The picture looked blury even on DVD.Second iz the actin iz the same. Third just lookin atDMX abusing 3 women by getting them addicted to coke and heroin.And him abusing his own son, what is wrong with that man.I think this movie make X alot Crazyer.I wouldn't reccommendthis movie for relegous people, HELL NO!!!! If you worshipthe devil andU want to die,And like looking at people being killed ,then it's strongly reccommended 4 U."
5,A movie with a great story and a great bad guy,"This movie is very good people. Some of you(like Mook, you ol' dumbass) hate this movie from the start because DMX stars in it. Ok so are you saying that he did not portray a very good bad guy. Of course he did. The directing was also very good taking you to the grittiest part of New York. This movie left me thinking ""Damn DMX played a ruthless mean gangster."" Ernest Dickerson, I thank you for making this film."
5,Excellent,I saw it on TV. I thought it was excellent. Very well written and very well portrayed by very talented actors.
4,"NOT A GREAT MOVIE,BUT, NOT A BAD ONE EITHER","DMX plays King David a charasmatic street thug who returns home to seek back his throne, but is not welcomed with open arms. David Arquette plays a suprising dramatic role as a reporter, who peices King David's story together a little to quickly and over zealously for the movie's own good.Overall, a suprisingly good movie."
3,"""Never Die Alone"" Review","Short and sweet -- This movie is a good one-time see. I probably wouldn't buy it, but I'd recommend most people watch it. It's not your typical Kill/Drugs/Sex movie. Yes, that's all in it, but it has more of a storyline than all that."
1,Couldnt make it past half the film,"I like DMX but this movie just plain blows. Did someone use an old camcorder to film it? The lighing, sound and everything totally sucked. It's not even a full hour and a half long. I think I made it about 40 minutes and shut it off."
4,Problem solved!,"It took care of our problem with our old fan, which was noisy and constantly running. The one little problem we had with this new fan was addressed promptly and satisfactorily by the seller."
2,This is not quite.,"Pros: It works fine. Not seriously noisy.Cons: It's not quite. If someone wants a silent PC, this should be avoided."
2,Not worth the purchase,"INITIAL REVIEW: Yeah I was screwing in the screws, and the plastic started to crack a little bit, so I had to back out the screws and then re-screw them in & then it was fine. Other than that this thing is silent as a grasshopper.UPDATE: Upon further review I'm finding that this fan makes a lot of noise. Perhaps there's a way to lower the speed, but my system shows my cpu fan at higher rpm's than this fan, but this fan makes way more noise. In fact it is the only fan I hear in my computer. If I could return this I would."
2,Extremely loud fan,This fan is louder than my entire system. It was so loud I had to disconnect it. Now it's just sitting in my case collecting dust. I wouldn't recommend this fan if you want to be in the same room as your computer.
1,No Fan of the Fan,"This is just an ordinary fan without much consideration for the amount of noise that it is producing. If you sit at your computer for long periods of time, and like quiet, then this is not the fan."
5,:),"I bought it because it was cheap.I didn't think it would have good power,but it dose.It a great fan.I would buy another one for other pc if i ever need one."
2,Loud,"These case fans seem to move a lot of air, but they are not very quiet. Noise level was my primary consideration when choosing this product (which claims silent operation), so I am quite disappointed. I'll probably keep them despite the annoyance. For the price, I'm not sure that I could find anything better, and it's too much of a hassle to change them out again..."
3,Meh,"Clock it down to 7 volts. At 12 it's a screaming banshee of a fan. Better yet, spend a couple extra bucks and get the fluid dynamic bearings."
2,Gets loud shortly,"I got this fan to replace one that had been going for 5+ years. In less than 3 months, this fan started making exactly the same sound as the one it replaced. It still works (I know this because I can hear it, and that's the reason it has 2 stars instead of 1) but it has developed a rhythmic staccato thrumming, as though it might be unbalanced, maybe, but there's no buildup on the fan, nothing to clean. These fans are so simple there's no hope of adjusting anything. I guess I get what I pay for. Very disappointed."
4,Excellent little fans,"I ordered 2 Cooler Master 80mm fans a few weeks ago to try to cool down my pc video card. Put them both in last week. My video card would overheat when I would play certain games for a long time, but with the new fans in place, I have had no problems! They are a little noisy, but not more than expected. Overall, I am very pleased."
3,Cheap but noisy,"I wanted to cool my receiver. This would have done the job but it is too noisy. It's less than 30 bB, but I ended up going to Fry's and finding one rated at less than 9 dB. Too cheap to return so I'll keep it for some other use."
1,Crappy.....,"Pros: Comes with 4-pin converter.Cons: Very cheap plastic cannot even accept the included screws without breaking off the corners......and the noise.....LOUD!!! (If the screws were too big, it's Corsairs fault)Result: I wasted my money, should have bought SUSCOOL 81s or som'n else. Guess if both fans shatter later(crappy plastic), least i got some 4-pins converters out of it. :-/"
3,Loud,This fan moves a lot of air but it's almost as loud as a desk fan. I put this in my HTPC and it turned it into a white noise generator :). It did drop the temp from 81C to 62C though.
4,"Not bad, but not great!","I am comparing these fan to a CM 120mm fan than I also bought from amazon.This 80mm fan moves nearly as much air as the 120mm due to spinning twice as fast. The fan also should last twice as long to the double ball bearing set up as apposed to the sleeve bearing one on the 120mm.Unfortunately these fans are from silent. The higher RPM combined to inherently noisier ball bearing set up yields noticeable noise.So if you are looking for well crafted, good looking, effective and long lasting 80mm fans, these will do well. If you are building a silent PC, theses will definelty not do.Ohh and as a plus, these fans included a 3 pin to a 4 pin molex adapter, cudos here, as the 120mm fans did have these!All in all, I recommend these fans as long as a little noise inst a great issue for you."
3,"Good price, not as quiet as hoped","I bought this as a second fan for a Windows Media Center PC. The PC sits in my living room so it has to be very quiet. Based on the reviews and details, I thought this would be quiet enough. Nope. The fan is currently unplugged inside the case because it's too loud."
4,Nice.,Pros: This thing moves a decent ammount of air. Does a good job for it's price. Comes with a 3pin to 4pin adapter.Cons:It gets a little noisy running at full power.Other thoughts: Would buy more for future cases anyday.
2,Great fan but no screws,Great fan but no screws to mount it to the case. Well i was going to mount it to a video card but thats a bit hard with a screw to attach it.
4,Added Fan to Case,emachines from store had no system fan in the case - this worked great and is quiet. Keeps case at least 10 degrees cooler than before. Fits when fan screw holes are 3 inches apart.
4,GREAT LITTLE CPU FAN,"Great little quiet fan to replace old fan on an AMD AM2 heatsink socket. Works just fine, keeps the old machine cool and functioning."
1,Don't buy it from this merchant,"If you buy this item, don't buy it here. Not only that they sent me the wrong item, but it took them for ever to respond to my messages, and in the end they even refused to refund the S&H costs that I incurred because of their mistake. You will end up saving time and money by buying somewhere else."
5,Heavenly church music,"Mystery of the East: Music from Russian Churches and Monasteries is a beautiful collection ofRussian Orthodox Liturgical music.It is heavenly, awe-inspiring and beautiful.Amazon verified purchase."
3,I read it with an open but was not sold on what it says,I may have not been as open minded as I think - I certainly tried to be so when I read this book. I was given a copy as a gift from some very believing and caring friends. I was facing major heart procedures and they were looking for other routes for me to take.I did not go for the operations - and went with five stents instead. I am not even sure that was the right path to go - but I have not been sold on the ideas that this book sets forth. Maybe there was not enough evidence for me to embrace. Ity just felt like an un-natural way to get healthy.I think non-surgical procedurs are always a better way to go - it is just that I am not very sure that chelation therapy is the right answer for me.My advice is to read the book and look at the facts and how you personally feel.
1,"Alas, the chelation bunkum again","Asked to check into chelation therapy for some ailing friends and relatives, I did, hoping very much to find something that would offer hope and help to those who were moving beyond the capacity of conventional treatment to cure.Regretfully I found absolutely no evidence beyond the hype of chelationist ads and the desperate hopes of the ill that chelation therapy is anything other than the worst sort of snake oil.There have in the last several years been several excellent studies done to determine the efficacy of chelation therapy. Not one demonstrates any effect beyond that caused by caring health care workers and hope. While those effects are interesting, they are not life saving.For a sobering and very fair discussion, go to the Quackwatch site, ......My best wishes to all."
1,how long can it take to get a package 200 miles,Ordered H4 headlight bulbs 8/30 didn't ship until 9/2 expected delivery date 9/9 it's now 9/10 PM no lights have looked all over the web sites can't find anything on how to contact amazon!!! Everybody told me I was crazy not to do business with them because they have no phone number listed. I guess I was right glad I didn't spend a lot of money but it sure has put my project back.
1,bulb lasted 4 hours!!!,"this bulb lasted 4 hours. after exploding, a yellow powder is now on the inside of my brand new hella e codes which i can not take apart and get all the glass out of or wipe the yellow powder out of. very pissed off."
3,They are OK for the price,I usually get one year out of my bulbs . If they don't last this long I will buy a bulb less sensative to vibration next time.
2,Every bit as bright as the factory 60/55W bulb,"Same resistance, same current draw and similar light output. Not sure why they call this an 100/80W bulb, it doesn't use that much power at 12 volts."
1,Hella H4 100/80,"Bought 2 Hella H4 100/80 lightbulb, lasted 4 weeks before low beam stopped working, thought Hella was a good brand, are very disappointed !!!"
1,Picture is wrong,"I would give it more stars rating if I would need only one of them. The picture shows 2 blue colored bulbs in clear package, I have got only 1 clear bulb in small carton box, nothing like on the picture. I could nowhere find if it was only 1 or two buldbs, and I assumed that I will get 2 according to the picture."
5,Anthrax - State of Euphoria,State of Euphoria is an excellent album. One of Anthrax's better ones. If you're really into thrash/speed this is one to purchase.
4,Not bad at all,"Many grief that this is Anthrax's worst album. For the record, I agree but its not so bad that its stands out being total [...]. While most of the songs are average at best, Finale and Be All, End All are very enjoyable. Music of complexity and I like that."
2,very dissapointing...,".. STATE OF EUPHORIA was a big letdown for me, esspesicaly after listening and loving ATL for so long. it gets two stars for the song anti social but thats it. i guess i'm not ""that"" into anthrax i guess, but ATL is one of my all time favorite cd's, ever. i really have no desire to listen to this anymore, after the second listen it was just stupid. this is crap compared to ATL."
4,Worst '80s album.,"That's not saying much though. SOE is still good and enjoyable. They toned their sound down and it's less heavy and a lot lighter than Among the Living but still a decent follow-up. The songs are sslower and more melodic but it's still a metal album and it's definitely thrash. Out of Sight, Out of Mind is one of my favorite Anthrax songs. There's one thing that makes it a step down from ATL, it's the production. The songs are great and it's an album worth owning but it could use a remaster."
2,Sorry Guys But This Album Sucks,Aside from a couple standout tracks like Be All End All and the Anti-Social cover this album blows. Next to Stomp 442 this is possibly the worst release from the band. I'm not sure what Scott and Charlie were thinking. Still only a minor blemish in the road for the Belladonna era as everything else the band released from 1985-1991 was epic.
2,A big let down between their two best (early) albums...,"Production is thick, sludgy and just plain terrible... even worse than the notoriously sludgy wall of sound that Metallica achieved on ""Justice"". The songs are mostly long, not very inspired and tend to blend together too easily. Anthrax just sounds kind of tired on this disc.Which is odd, as it's not that bad, taken song by song. Listen to just ""Antisocial"", or ""Now it's Dark"". Really pretty good songs, taken one by one. As an album, however, it just all tends to blur together into a bombastic wall of fuzzy grit... and not in a good way.Still very worth a listen, and worh owning. Easily picked up used in local used CD exchange type stores... which also shows how well it's stood the test of time for repeated listening over the years. Unless you're huge into Anthrax, or just love that thick, bad 1980's production, it MAY gather dust in your collection."
3,it's not really bad...,it's just that it was too much like ATL and not enough like ATL. I have not listened to it since I bought it.There's just nothing to bring you back to it.
5,VERY UNDERATED!!!!,"what a great anthrax album this turned out to be after their classic follow up to among the living.now this album is pretty damn weak....well just the production....but everything else kicks ass.as i said before joeys vocals are awsome as usual,guitars shred hear and their all over the place!!!.and lots of other things like more tributes such as stephen king.this album is kinda dumb to me cause it sounded like anthrax was getting into comic books,books,cartoons(maybe),etc..but everything else kicks and the best songs are:be all,end all,out of sight,out of mind,make me laugh,anti socail,now its dark....the only bad song was 13...ugh thank GOD it was short.anyways if your a big fan of anthrax and thrash metal...this is a must have in your collection!!."
2,Mediocre and not put together well.,"Some people think this Anthrax at thier peak,or think this is thier best album. I think STATE OF EUPHORIA is rather weak. Some songs are decent,but thats it,decent not great. Their next one PERSISTENCE OF TIME is much better.Get that one instead,and avoid STATE OF EUPHORIA."
3,Not the best from Anthrax,"""State of Euphoria"", Anthrax's follow up to their classic and influential ""Among the Living"", is sadly one of the band's most lacking albums. Even though it features two of the band's most well known and beloved songs, ""Be All End All"" and ""Antisocial"", ""State of Euphoria"" still manages to come off as pretty average thanks to some just plain lame songs like ""Make Me Laugh"", ""Schism"", ""13"", and the closing ""Finale""; all of which are possibly the worst songs Anthrax ever recorded with Joey Belladonna on vocal duty. That aside, the rest of the songs featured here are solid thrashers, but as a whole ""State of Euphoria"" can't hold a candle to ""Spreading the Disease"" or ""Among the Living"". All in all, if your a new fan to Anthrax, start with any of the previously mentioned albums or even some of the later John Bush era albums (""Volume 8"" through ""Greater of Two Evils"") before picking ""State of Euphoria"" up."
5,Definitely worth a read,"Vincent Sheean pioneered the foreign correspondent memoir with ""Personal History."" It is a forgotten book, but one that any foreign correspondent, would-be foreign correspondent or plain history buff ought to read. Sheean had a Zelig-like quality of finding himself in international hot spots throughout the 1920s. But it wasn't simply by chance. He repeatedly risked death to visit with rebel leaders and to better size up what they were doing. In doing this, he was following the fundamental craft of a journalist: pursuing the truth.I thought I knew history pretty well, but I hadn't heard of several of the important events that Sheean covered. Nonetheless, he brought them alive with his harrowing tales of dodging bullets and bombs and his personal style of reporting. Sheean even foreshadows some enduring lessons, especially from the Arab-Jewish conflict that he covered in 1929 in Palestine."
1,Not impressed with this performance,This album is extremely average compared to solo D-Block albums. I also thought there was not enough Jadakiss. I only liked about 4 tracks on the whole album and did not deserve much more than one star. Sheek Louch's album 'After Taxes' was much better than this and i hope future D-Block albums are not in any way similar to this one. I think the D-Block/G-Unit complications make D-Block weaker and the dissing of G-Unit does not really work all that well. I do really hope that the next album is an improvement to this one.
3,Ok but not great,"It's an OK prosciutto, a little too fatty and maybe it could use some more aging. The packaging is easy to open but once opened you can't re-seal it."
1,Still not here,"As of the blizzard II of 2010 I have yet to recieve my purchase of 01/08/10. After numerous emails stating such, I am in limbo as to what Amazon and /or Cdwarehouse is doing to rectify this problem. The lack of communication has left a sour taste in my mouth. As things do happen< I am accepting of that, but the lack of communication is baffling. Where is a consumer to turn???A unsatisfied and becoming an increasingly more unhappy customerPhase 1"
4,Good Introduction,Lots of music (14 tracks) from the Baltimore based Grainger Brothers with a variety of sound and style and a shifting set of players. Gary played several years with John Scofield prior to this release. This has some jazzy tracks but more variety and contributions from many of the major talents from the Baltimore area and beyond.
1,not very good..,"i could only read an hour of this. read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by hennerita mears. its much better."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH IMOVIE,"I connect my digital camcorder to my computer via USB. I then import all of my footage into an external hard drive through this adapter. IT WILL NOT IMPORT VIDEO LONGER THAN 10 MINUTES! When I import it in every other possible way not including this adapter (firewire 800, 400, and usb on the external HD, or into the internal) it works perfectly."
3,"When it works, it works well, but it is not dependable.","I have a brand-new MacBook Pro, and purchased this unit at the Apple store together with the computer. When I have my camera on the Firewire 800 port, capturing via FinalCut Pro and saving to the external drive connected to the card, my machine constantly crashes--the screen goes gray from top to bottom, and then a box pops up in four or five languages telling me I have to do a hard reboot. When I don't have the camera installed, or when i have saved to my hard drive, transfer of files from my internal drive to the external goes very smoothly. However, when I power off the card, I often get the same crash scenario.I'm not sorry I bought it, but it is disappointing that an Apple-sponsored product is so undependable."
1,Failed to function,"I purchased this device to use with my Macbook Pro computer with the latest Leopard updates, and the latest driver updates for this product.The device did NOT function at all with either of my brand new ""G-Tech Drive G"" hard drives. These hard drives are the highest rated and finest the market has to offer, and the fact they do not function is ridiculous.What's worse is every time I plugged in either of my hard drives it forced the computer into a kernal panic (a message came up that said you MUST restart your computer).So my advice to perspective buyers is to steer clear until they get the bugs worked out."
1,no entertainment in death if innocent lives,"the death of animals as a means of eating or survival is one thing. but to murder an animal for 'realistic' screenplay, to make a profit or for any form of entertainment is a horrible example of mankinds cruelty. supporting this film reduces you to the level of those who enjoy fighting pit bulls. don't be that person. tell fox films that innocent blood will not be shed for our entertainment."
1,flicka,Hi well to start I was excited about watching this movie cause it looked a lot like dreamer which I enjoyed. BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! Katie is selfish and has a bad attitude which never gets better throughout the movie. The characters are allways yelling at each other. And Katie is also dumb and tries things whith Flicka that get her hurt and in trouble. I hated this and so did my Mom but my Dad strangely liked it. Anyways this is one of those love it or hate it movies. And I personally hated it. Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke.
3,Family movie,"about getting to tell your dad off, and making parents look like they are bad because they look out for their children. If you like movies that make dads seem hateful, this one is for you."
1,"""My Dead Flicka""","Since not just one, but TWO horses were reported to have been killed during the making of this film, I have no interest in seeing a fairy tale that was produced by people who apparently know and appreciate a lot about making money but little about consideration for horses. I have lived with horses for nearly all of my 65 years and can find no justification for any such unnecessary human exploitation of animal life."
1,FOX Films killed two horses in the making of this movie!,"Before the release date of this movie, it came out that FOX films had caused the death of two horses - which is why you won't see the disclaimer in the credits ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film"" - and that FOX tried to pay off witnesses to the event.No matter how good the movie might be, there is no reason to support an evil company that does this. Oh, and regardless of what fans of this movie write here, Flicka was pretty much panned by critics and didn't do well at the box office; I had predicted that Flicka would be the ""Gigli of 2006"" and it didn't even do as well as that flop."
1,"According to the American Humane Association, 2 horses died","According to the American Humane Association, ""Four Certified Animal Safety Representatives monitored the filming of Flicka, and American Humane deeply regrets the death of two horses that occurred on the set."" and ""The 'No Animals Were Harmed'End Credit obviously cannot be given when an animal actor is fatally injured during production."" If they say two horses died, then I believe them. I just can't watch a film knowing that animals died to make it."
1,FOX Films killed two horses in the making of this movie!,"Before the release date of this movie, it came out that FOX films had caused the death of two horses - which is why you won't see the disclaimer in the credits ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film"" - and FOX tried to pay off witnesses to the event.No matter how good the movie might be, there is no reason to support an evil company that does this.

1,Entertainment at what price?,"I'm sure this film is a really sweet story, but they killed two horses making it. I was really excited about this movie until I learned about the deaths, and then learned on top of it all they were paying people off who worked on the set NOT to talk about it! If you really love horses, skip this hypocritical fantasy and don't support a film that shows such disregard for it's own subject. Read the book instead, or even better, plan a family trip to a horse rescue. That way you won't be hurting the very thing you're there to see."
4,Flicka,Good horse movie for the young and old. Little more drama than the original Flicka. Tim McGraw is great in this movie.
4,Flicka,"The movie Flicka is tearjerking, yet an amazing adventure. The scenery is extremely gorgeous set in the mountains where wild horses run. Katie(Alison Lohman)finds a beautiful wild mustang. Her strong headed father(Tim McGraw)says that wild horses ruin a heard. Katie heads out to find this mustang. Something unexpected happens. The family finally persuades Tim, and they keep her(Flicka). Katie ignores her fathers rules about leaving the crazy horse alone and starts to get to know her. Katie names her Flicka. Something happens when Katie is training Flicka and Tim sells her. Katie finds a way to Flicka and they go on a crazy journey. the ending is sad but it gets better towards the very end. This movie is rated pg13 and is a great movie for the family."
1,My DEAD Flicka,I refuse to see this movie and I urge anyone who cares about the welfare of horses and animals to do so as well. This is NOT a movie for horse lovers. FOX killed 2 horses in the making of this horrible movie and then tried to cover it up and did nothing to try to help. Look it up for yourself!BOYCOTT FLICKA! LET FOX KNOW THIS IS NOT OK!
1,Inhumane Movie,"I have not seen Flicka because I have read several reputable reports that at least two horses died very inhumanely in the making of this movie. If you care about horses, you should research the claims for yourself and hopefully you won't rent or purchase this movie."
4,My friend FLICKA,"I was a child of the fifties and grew up with the book/movie/television show,""My Friend Flicka."" While this video is far removed, my granddaughter, age six, just had to have it and watched it over and over, cryig at the sad parts. I horse-lovers movie for sure."
4,Good Family movie!,"I myself remember the original TV series and other movies of this genre with fondness but my daughter loves hoerses and this movie (along with Spirit!) is her hands down favorite, So much so that she wanted her own copy. I'm sure she'll share it with her kids one day and that makes it a great deal!"
4,Movie review (Flicka),This is a very good movie that grabs you right in the beginning. The actors portray their parts with the utmost realism. I am a huge fan of Tim Mcgraw and Maria Bello which made the movie that much better. Definately a must have for your collection.
2,Annoying characters,"This movie should carry a warning about all the whining and arguing contained in it. Why on earth a smart horse like Flicka didn't have enough sense to run for the hills, away from this dysfunctional family is beyond me. I for one have had it up to here with smartalecknowitallkidteachesdumbparent movies. At least in the original movie, Roddy McDowall was respectful to his father. The character of Katie in this movie is just obnoxious. The whole family could benefit from some counselling. The scenery and horses are beautiful however."
5,Remake but still a classic...,"Okay, listen. My friends went to see this movie. I was in the process of moving so couldn't go with them, but they totally loved it. Scenery, horses,ranching...welcome to the REAL America, the heart and soul of the country. Unfortunately, a two yearlings died in the making-of. I love horses, and work with them on a regular basis, and want to say THINGS INVOLVING EQUINES GO WRONG! They, although are domesticated, are still wild at heart, and someone probably got a cell-phone call while wrangling the colts and spooked them.[...] Treat yourself to a good piece of American filmmaking and enjoy."
5,Flicka,"I bought this movie for my granddaughter since she loves horses, but I fell in love with the movie also. The characters were very good also, Tim McGraw was good on the eyes too. Over all the movie was great!"
2,Strictly phoned in,"As the father of a 9-year-old girl, I'm always on the lookout for a good age-appropriate movie she'll like.Neither of us was much impressed by this pro-forma effort's weak, very contrived script. Yes, if you have a child my daughter's age you'll be glad to know the movie contains no profanity or gratuitous violence or sexual titilation. But it is, alas, entirely forgettable.I suggest renting it only if and when Amazon prices it at 99 cents."
2,Poor!,Shoul have been sold as less than poor condition. Cleaned yuck off of disc and still does not play through on rather side.
1,Probably the year's worst film,"This film is awful and insulting. Nothing makes sense, and the charactersare stereotypes that can't even get their stereotype right. The tough guy Dad is soft and the girl...how annoying is she?? And all that ""america is wild and free, blah, blah"", and then she wants todomesticate her symbol of freedom??? HAHA...this movie SUCKS!"
1,Don't reward Fox for negligence that cost 2 horses their lives,"Fox is counting on getting the money of animal lovers for this movie, and all that can be done about the unfortunate and preventable deaths of two beautiful horses is to BOYCOTT. We have to show entertainment companies that we won't tolerate the sacrificing of animals, especially for mindless junk like this one."
1,Distorted view of evil,"I like most of Ferrini's books but I was appalled when I read how he feels that there is no such thing as evil and we must love these people. Love mass murderers, rapists, child molesters, Adolph Hitler, Kim Jong, Chavez and other heartless, cruel dictators? I don't think so. This section was about one third of the way through the book. I was so disgusted, I stopped reading it and threw it in the trash where it belonged. If there is no distinction between good and evil, what is the point of a civilized, moral society or even believing in Jesus Christ and God? Warped view. Don't know if I want to even read any more of his books. What a disappointment. This is what is wrong w churches and many christians. Political correctness."
3,Worth reading for developmental psychology,"The distinctive point in this book is that the ""somewhat chancy interactive effects of nature and nurture are surprisingly perverse."" This is a crucial point for the so-called 'nature-nurture' debate. There is a lot yet to be understood about gene-environment developmental transactions. This book is worth reading as a step along the way."
2,Driver doesn't work with XP as advertised,"Total waste of money. No matter what we tried, the driver would not work. I tried the CD and downloads and it still would never work with the phone it was advertised to work with.My daughter was SOO disappointed. She wanted to download pictures from her cell phone to the computer."
3,"works, but set-up is a challenge",Got the cable to work after some frustration and research. I have the Nokia 6101. The driver CD included with the cable did not actually contain a driver for my particular model (!). Following the model charts on the CD basically directed me to download Nokia PC Suite. This software package does include a driver but not for this cable (only for the Nokia branded cable). After some web searches I found a suggestion to download a driver for the KQ-U8A cable. This driver worked for this CA-42 cable. Win XP recognized the cable and then I used the Nokia PC Suite as a data manager for my phone. Apparently there are internal differences between these generic cables and the Nokia branded cable.
2,"Does work, Badly...","Both of the other reviews said the cable did not work. In short, yes..the cable does not work. But after some poking around on the disk I found that you need to do certain things in a certain order to get the cable to function...you also need to use the same USB port every time...as far as I remember you need to install the driver from the CD 1st, then download the current version of Nokia PC Suite, install that, plug in the cable and it should work...but if not try other orders of these things and keep in mind that I may have forgotten something."
1,"If you value your time and effort, DON'T BUY IT.","This cable has serious installation problems. Even if your phone is listed as compatible it might not work. You can read enough stories on the WEB of people that bought this cable and it just doesn't work.If you value your time, you'll spend more than what the cable is worth trying to install it, you can be SURE of that."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I received my order in great condition two days before the estimated delivery date. I'm using thisNokia CA-42 Compatible USB Data Cablewith a Nokia 6103 phone. The latest CA-42 cable driver off Nokia's site doesn't seem to work with it. But it DOES work just fine with the old driver provided on the CD, and the latest version of Nokia PC Suite (7.0.8.2) from the website. No Complaints!"
1,Didn't work for me,"I read the reviews on here, and thought I'd take a chance. I tried connecting via PC Suite. I tried CA-42 drivers from the web. I went to install the software on the enclosed CD, but got a warning message saying that the software had not been confirmed compatible with Windows and that continuing could cause damage to computer/system. I tried downloading the driver (KQ-U8A) that one of the other viewers recommended, but could not get the cable to recognize there was a phone connected, no matter what I tried.I finally broke down & bought the Nokia branded cord, and it worked like a charm, right out of the box. My recommendation: don't bother with this cord. You may be able to get it to work, but you're more likely to end up having to go with something else anyway."
4,CA 42 - Nokia 6103,I bought this about a month back for my nokia 6103. The cable works fine. The only problem I had was installing the driver on my vista machine. But then searched the net on the Nokia discussion forum and then it was an easy task. I would say good deal.
3,Not what I expected,The cable does not works always. It's a generic cable and not an original Nokia one.The price was right and the delivery was fast enough.Thanks
3,Cable ok,"the cable works but is not recognized by the phone, so the phone does not know it is connected until the pc software accesses the data."
3,cheap but questionable quality,I continue to experience problems with this cable. Chances of connecting when using my cell phone as modem are about 50% and getting incompatibility error messages. Not 100% sure if the cable is the reason but suspicious. I had to switch to this cable since the previous DKU-5 cable wouldn't work under Vista.
4,Works Fine,"I bought this cable for 5 bucks (plus tax & shipping) because i refuse to pay 30 to 50 bucks for a Nokia cable and wanted to backup my contacts & transfer a ringtone from my PC. I find that it works fine if you follow the instructions. I first installed driver from CD-ROM, then installed updated PC suite program, then plug cable to PC then cable to phone and Windows recognized my 2125i phone. Other users with problems must not have followed instructions."
1,Nokia CA-42 Compatible USB Data Cable,"I had not received the driver cd, so i had to return the item back"
1,Don't get stuck!,I bought this cable and it didn't work at all for my Nokia CA-42. Waste of time and money!
5,USB Data Cable works great,This cable works every bit as good as the more expensive brands I saw in the store. Data transfers are rapid and complete. Great product!
1,"Not exactly ""Plug and Play""","I originally bought it to synch both my phone and my wife's phone. I doesn't seem to notice when you disconnect one phone and connect a phone.The only way I got it to work was to uninstall the software, then reinstall it -- EACH TIME I SWITCHED PHONES!Maybe this item is for decorative use and they just forgot to explain that in the documentation."
1,Junk for under $9.00,This cable is totally incompatable with Nokia 6102i. I had to pony up the $50.00 for the Nokia version. My advice is you do the same. The people at Amazon should ban these crooks. Too bad I can't give it less than 1 star.
1,not very good for nokia 5070,"It doesn't work well with nokia 5070 in all computers, I don't know why. And the CD that comes with it is workless."
5,beautiful & well-told,"Several parabels are told, each with beautiful illustrations. Each starts out with ""One day Jesus told a story. This is what He said...""The parabels are simplified for children to understand, yet they do not lose the accuracy of scripture. There is also a follow-up for each parabel, saying ""What did you learn?"" and then summarizing the lesson.These are simple and short, and easily accomodate a wide range of children."

3,Not what you expect!,"I heard from my cousins this concert WAS AMAZING in the theaters, and the said it seemws like you are really there. It was also going to be on Disney channel, so I told my mom to go to the store and get me 3-D glasses to watch the movie with. I was so excited I wanted to invite friends over, nobody was able to come but I was still overly happy so I watched it with my mom. It wasn't what I expected. My cousins said it felt like you were really there, but it just felt like I was watching regular TV. Don't buy it, its a waste of money."
1,BAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Miley Cyrus, Billy ray, Camp Rock, High school musical, Pink, Britney, Christina, Duff, Lohan, jessica, ashlee, johnas brothers, blink 182,good charlotte and every manufactured, fake, poser, lipsyncing ""band"" or ""artist"" of this type needs to be loaded on a rocket and shot toward the sun."
5,My daughter loves this movie,Looks better on blu ray than in the theater. I loved watching it with my 9yr old disabled daughter. She loved watching it on our big 1080p tv it was like we were at a concert. she loved it. The movie arrived fast. If something can make my child happy I am pleased.
3,"terrible audio, great video","We were so excited to play this DVD, but when I started it I actually thought something was wrong with our home theater system. Turns out the audio recording is just plain awfull, probably would be fine if you still watch things on a box TV, but not if you have good speakers and a really good sound system. Very disappointing and annoying for me, but of course my six year old can't tell the difference at all, and I bought it for her. She loves it and dances in her costumes when she watches it."
4,review per grand daughter,"I know my grand daughter loves Hannah Montana. I had just recently taken her to see the movie, so when I saw this concert very reasonably priced decided to buy it and have it sent to her home. I haven't seen the video myself, but my grand daughter seems to love it. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,Best of both worlds concert,I liked the movie. I just thought I was buying a new blu-Ray and was sent a used one. That is the only bad thing I have ever got from here.
5,Good. Very good.,I really didn't want to watch this since I think Billy Ray is really pimping out his daughter but lately got custody of the daughter I never knew I had and she had to have this. I have to give a nod to Disney. Great use of Anaglyph 3d. Anaglyph was never meant for out of screen effects and this DVD shows it. Terrific 3D as it shows the venue and crowd at a great distance and doesn't try to hard to impress. Not impressed with the girl since she can't sing but am impressed with the 3D. Good job Disney. Hope they release more 3D movies like this.
4,HANNAH MONTANA,This product was a gift for my two nieces. The item was shipped to their address and arrived promptly. The kids were very excited and the price of the item was great. The product was in great condition. Thanks
4,Hannah Montana 3-D movie,I bought this item for my grand daughter for her birthday.She said it was a good movie but it jumped back and forth between 3-D and regular movie.Those of us who have seen 3-D movies know this is the norm.She overall gave it a thumbs up.
1,NOT 3D! Don't buy this!,It's not 3D it's just blue and red dots. Doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money. Really. Don't. Buy. This. Is this 20 words yet?
2,"Not for me, but the daughter likes it","This is not my style of music, but my 9 yr old really enjoyes it."
3,3-D not good,The 3-d version is not good. Sometimes you see the blurred image as if you did not even have the 3-d glasses on. I'm glad that a 2-d version was included otherwise I would of had to return it.
2,not a good 3D experience,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be great to watch because Miley Cyrus is a great singer and performer, but when I opened it to watch the 3D version there was nothing 3D about it. It came with four red and blue 3D glasses . It made me feel nauseated (well, not really) but I could not watch anymore of the 3D version. You can even watch it without the glasses because it looks like the 2D version except with a little blur. It is horrible like watching VHS version. It was a disappointment. I might return it if i can. I wonder if other 3D glasses will work. For me, I don't like concert versions of songs."
1,Movie was EXCELLENT but 3D graphics were HORRIBLE!,"Please don't misunderstand, the show itself was outstanding! Buy the 2D version you will love it! Very entertaining, makes you sing along and even want to dance. I would say it's Miley at her best but I've been to two of her concerts on the Wonder World tour and she's definitely giving this concert a run for its money. However, I was SO SO SO dissapointed at the 3D graphics. Nothing appeared to be 3D and trust me I spent an hour trying to convince myself that I was seeing something in 3D. It all appeared blurry even with the glasses on! The one I purchased was the regular DVD not Blu-Ray and I read a review on here that says the Blu-Ray one was excellent. I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I'm tempted to go buy one so that I can experience this concert in true 3D fashion. But again, it's completely worth purchasing the 2D version but you'll be dissapointed if you buy the 3D DVD."
4,Hannah Rocks out,"I love this DVD and will be watching it loads of times. Miley sounds great on this DVD and I really enjoy the behind the scenes footage. My only thing is I would have loved the full version of Ready,set,dont go on the DVD as Miley and her Dad sing great together in Country"
3,"Fun, but use it fast!","This is a great idea, but the engineering on this product could be a little better. Usually by the time I'm, ahem, done, the little putting green has sunk to the bottom of the bowl. I don't want to lose it when I flush, so I have to fish it out with my hands. I don't mind so much, but it just seems like they need to make it a little more buoyant. Another minor quibble is that, I've found that when I'm putting both of my hands are occupied, and well, let's just say it hurts my aim and the whole bathroom can get rather messy. I'm assuming this is just a matter of technique, though, and I'll figure this out eventually. Other than that, though, it's a lot of fun!"
4,Its ok,kinda cheaply made but its a good conversation piece. Very funny. Great gag gift. recommend to anyone for a gift
3,Puters and putters,"I was at first interested in this product when it said it had a puter that came with it. Now, I said to myself, I'd sure like some puter whenever I'm on the toilet. Well, immediately after the pot, that is. But instead of a puter, it came with a putter. Imagine my dismay! But at least there was a hole of sorts, and it did keep me mildly entertained last time I was constipated. Which is why it gets three stars."
4,A howl,"This was chosen as a Christmas gift for a golfer in my life. When I saw the photograph on the front of the package, I couldn't stop laughing. The recipient of the gift was equally taken with the gift. He's vowed to never ""rush"" his business and has had a blast playing potty putter."
1,Hard to program,"I found this timer difficult to program and when I wanted to operate a single valve by itself it wanted to run all the valves it was grouped with on the timer (A,B, or C). Someone with some common sense needs to design this clock so it can be quickly programmed or operated manually so individual lawn or drip system areas can receive extra attention just on their own."
3,Not quite what they say it does.,"First, its easy to program, easy to set up, and works very well. This new model gets rid of the battery backup and will internally hold its memory for several years but the clock will have to be reset on loss of power.What irks me about this timer is that it has three programs A, B, and C. Toro states on page 15 of the manual that they are completely independant of each other ""like having 3 timers in one"".This is absolutely not true. I wanted to set up three programs so on ""A"" it runs all my zones each day, but on rainy weeks I could switch it to ""B"" an only run one zone each day which adds water to my pond.It will not do that. If I set the switch to 'B'. It will run it then run ""A"". Toro recognizes this, but ignores my problem. Ok...but at least change the implication that they are independant. They are not."
4,"Warm, Readable, Nostalgic","Author Harry Golden (1902-1981) wrote the same type of short vignettes from his newspaper THE CAROLINA ISREALITE that one sees in his other books (ONLY IN AMERICA, FOR TWO CENTS PLAIN, etc). Golden is increasingly forgotten today, but his writing was often a warm trip down memory lane. Golden wrote about and generally embraced humanity, the USA, the family, Jewish immigrants in New York City, Christianity, North Carolina, church matters, economics, etc. Golden had heart for the little guy, wrote candidly about sex, and one was of those rare southern publishers that opposed segregation in the 1950's. Ironically, or perhaps not, his newspaper was popular among Christian clergy. This book is now dated, but its warm and insightful look at humanity still applies."
4,Love the author's name,"a moving , eloquently written story about the plants that shape humankind. This work reads like a journalistic overview of the subject as opposed to a penetrating scientific discourse, which is refreshing.It's more of a readable, easily digestible (pardon the pun) work for a general audience. Other works on the topic are more detailed but few are as accessible and enjoyable.Well done."
3,WUI= Wrtiing under the influence,"As an anthro. involved in drug research and who himself has nascent plans to write about the uncanny relationship between the drug experience, the writing process, and literature, I really wanted to love this book. I respect the author's endeavor to the task of exploring the subject, but, unfortunately, the violent aggregation of all the book's shortcomings have prevented me from finishing it in its entirety.Like others have rightfully said, references are disturbingly non-existent, the writing is stilted and confusing most of the time, and the content desultory of the highest order. This is not to say that the book lacks any value; in fact, one can fruitfully excavate valuable gems of information once the trauma of reading her prose subsides.Overall, it is clear that the author intended to write the book in an experimental mode that reflects the activity stated in the title: writing on drugs. ""A+"" for trying; ""F"" for failing to execute this elegantly."
3,My review,"Studs Terkel has done some very good things with this book and he clearly is a talented interviewer with a strong grasp of the state of race relations in the US. I don't know that this book was particularly well written as he really did little more than aggregate a lot of (often, not always) interesting interviews. I'm not sure the book is still contemporary and I do feel that race relations have come a good ways along since this book was written. That being said, I do think this book is very worthwhile for most anyone, even today. While it was very interesting to gain insight into minority views on the Reagan administration, Farrakhan, etc., I think I honestly gained more from the every day stories and perspectives that were related. It will certainly get you to think about race relations from an entirely new perspective and that is far and away its most valuable aspect."
1,"NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLES i'VE SEEN, NOBODY KNOWS MY SORROWS.",I expected the book would be excellent and interesting as Terkel's writing usually is. But what I discovered was a 60s pity party for blacks and white apologists. Oh! My! Its a big book about how white people suck.
3,Follow the Golden Rule,"This book addresses many good points. It took me several pages to realize the book can be summed up in four words. ""Follow the Golden Rule"". The book offers an insight into successful tactics to improve relationships with supervisors as well as work mates.m"
3,An introductory book to Spanish.,"There are 5 locations (farm, store, park, town, and home) fromwhich 20 words are translated from English to Spanish by the pull of atab. I was disappointed that the basic words like colors or body parts were not chosen as part of the 100 words. On the left side of each page is a full picture of the location; on the right side is the 20 words with a picture of each directly above the written word. The individual pictures do not directly match the same object on the opposite page; often the object is flipped or is seen from a different angle. I did appreciate the back two pages which gave a summary of all the words listed, including the English word, the Spanish word, and the Spanish pronunciation. I also liked the sturdy tabs which seem like they will last a long time."
5,great bite size pieces of Lewis thought,"Lewis is such a great Christian author! This book has various bite-sized quotes from many of his writings, many from Mere Christianity, from half a page to 3 pages long. I am reading this as I have my breakfast in the morning. I often find something to share with friends via email. I'm buying a dozen or so (used) as Christmas gifts this year."
2,Not for older women,"Unless you still have young, super-firm breasts, this bra will not work for you. It distorts the shape and creates a strange, flatten silhouette. I tried this on and looked 2 cup sizes smaller and I'm a 34DD. Ick..."
5,"I May Be Prejudiced, but...","Sarah J. Mason is a pen-pal of mine. We both owned Schipperke dogs, and have spoken on the phone and corresponded a bit over the years. She used my name in the novel for a character that doesn't actually appear in the story. She asked my permission to use the name, and everything. Quite exciting for someone who works in a library.It is a wonderfully complex story, and very well written.Most enjoyable!"
4,Fascinating stories of love gone wrong,"Like other eighteenth-century ""libertine novels,"" especially Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons, The Crimes of Love tells us what happens when extremely virtuous characters collide with extremely evil ones. And as with other classic writers of the late eighteenth century, the French here is easy for foreign readers. But by contrast with the novels (and the real-life acts) that have given Sade such a bad reputation, these stories are economical and interest us far more through psychology than through cruelty or perversion. To the five entertaining stories he has selected, Michel Delon adds the author's ""Idea on novels"" and an informative dossier.The only recent translation (out of print) was published in the textually unreliable Bantam Classics series. A new translation of these stories would be a worthy project for an intermediate or advanced student of French."
3,Whatever happened to this guy?,"Many years ago (1996) I saw Won-G perform live at my school. Pretty good for typical West Coast G-Funk. Problem was that Won-G wasn't from the WestCoast. This album showcased alot of good effort into trying to crossover but failed in the marketing aspect of the industry. Still, if you want a good Gangsta Rap CD which is underground, then this would be it."
4,Our Christian Marriage is now hotter than a FIRECRACKER!,"This book opened my husband's and my eyes -- and then our hearts! I had always been afraid to ask my husband to do what I wanted in the bedroom, thinking, foolishly, he would come to think of me as one of the prostitutes he regularly ministers to as part of our outreach program. Well, did this book change my mind! I have learned that ""crotchless"" does NOT equal ""unsaved."" And our marriage is so strong now, nothing can pull us apart. Thank you, thank you!"
4,Quality marriage resource,"This book is a dependable marriage counseling resource for engaged couples, newlyweds and even those long married. The only book I would rate more highly on the same topic is Dr. Ed Wheat's ""Intended for Pleasure""."
2,too technical and sterile!,"The Act of Marriage, did have its good points- but also alot of bad points. For those going into sex blindly, it may be a good read, however, I found it very manual like. The authors presented sex in a step by step form and did not leave much room for experimentation. Tey made it sound like sex had to be done in a certain orderly and ordered way or it would not be right. (...gently massage the area around the vulva for 5 minutes then proceed to massage the clitoris for ten minutes, making sure finger nails are cut and clean) Sex needs to be spontaneous and fun sometimes! The good part of the book was the mentioning of the Kegel exercises. I was happy to read about them, seeing that you can read about the wonders they do in magazines like Cosmo, I am glad that the Christian women can get in on the info!"
3,Chinese Translation,"I have read the first chapter of this book and I like this book so much. I am a Chinese and my English is no good so I can't continue to read. Do you have an Chinese translation for this book ""The Act of Marriage""."
4,"Thought I knew it all, but...","found this book had some interesting information. It brought my husband and I closer...sort of rekindled the flame after 28 years of marriage. I especially liked that it is written from a Christian view point and answers many questions about sex and marriage by looking directly to the bible to see what God wants for us and from us. Also has a lot of practical info. from years of research and marriage counseling. I think it would be especially helpful to newlyweds. Down side: stereotypes the roles of wives and husbands a bit. We need to work together, taking advantage of our God-given gifts and interests. That may mean the wife handles the finances or the husband does the cooking (just an example)."
2,Birth control information is misleading,"My wife and I read this book right before we were married and it contains practical information about what to expect in the sexual act and ways to increase physical enjoyment, although we did not find all of the suggestions to be useful. My main concern with the book is the chapter titled ""Sane Family Planning."" The LaHaye's heartily endorse the pill (oral contraceptives) as the preferred method of birth control, although there is a lot of evidence that the pill acts as abortifacient at least some of the time.....In addition, the LaHaye's description of the ""rhythm method"" poorly characterizes Natural Family Planning (NFP) techniques currently used today............."
2,"Not 'terrible', but not that great, either...","Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults. This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy. Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!! I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy."
3,Informative but x-rated.,"Very informative and interesting, but a little too much detail when the author talks exactly how to have sex. Kinda awkward and unneeded. Felt that it was too descriptive....almost pornographic. Not what I expected."
3,Become a Better Lover,"""The Act of Marriage"" is a book I kept hearing about while reading other books. I figured a Christian book on sex wouldn't have much helpful information. Well I have just been proven wrong. After reading several secular books on sex and comparing them to this one, ""The Act of Marriage"" is the one I would recommend to anyone considering marriage. Even if you have been married for over 10 years there is still more to learn. This is an extremely informative and detailed book on sexuality and it focuses a lot on female satisfaction and pleasure.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"No, No and No","What really turned me off about this book was when I read the chapter on ""Sane Birth Control"". I would have skipped that chapter since I have no interest in being a parent. But something prompted me to read it. I found a condemnation of the childfree lifestyle. Apparently, the authors have no familiarity with childfree issues. Nor did they seem to have much understanding and sympathy for those who would like to have children, but are physically unable to do so. The authors also do not acknowledge that women's roles have expanded since the early 20th century. The idea that most married women are or will be stay-at-home moms is not reality. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Psycho-babble cloaked in religion.,"If you are an Ultra-Conservative, this may be the book for you. Although it is written by husband and wife, it is very anti-female.Submissiveness is the key word here. If you believe your husband/mate should rule your world, then you will probably enjoy this book.This book reads like it was written for a woman of the 1900's. Sad, but true."
1,Money Better Spent Elsewhere...,"Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults. This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy. Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!! I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy."
4,Honeymoon Instruction Book,This is an excellent book for Christian newlyweds. It is basically sex ed from the biblical perspective. I recommend it to both women and men.
4,The Act of Marriage,This book is a good source for engaged couples and newlyweds. A great beginning to the sacredness of marriage and explains graphically all the questions you didn't know who to ask. I recommend this reading before sexual activity in the marriage bed.
3,it's ok,i liked it it had everything going for it BUT the size of the game was minute i finished it in 1 hour and with the unreal tornimant the first one it looks like it was slaped together in minits
1,HUH?,"I have never played FPS games before and was led to believe that Unreal Tournament 2003 was the be all and end all of FPS games. After one day of play, I don't get what the big deal is all about. I found this game confusing and not worth the time to learn all the tips/tricks/cheats and info about weapons. I will be selling this on eBay if you're interested!"
3,Just seems like a Qi Gong set to me,"Maybe I'm missing something but this seems like just another Qi Gong set. It's slightly ""harder"" than the average Qi Gong set you find in a book but it's not an Iron Gong set either.It seems to me that you would get the same benefit from any number of Qi Gong or yoga exercises.While I've dabbled in martial arts for many years (about 1 year Xing Yi training), I freely admit that I'm not expert. I'm just giving my honest opinion."
4,-=-,"Krapp's Last Tape is a humorous one act play involving a man named Krapp. Recording his life, he looks back on recorded spools of his life. The recorded spools talk about previous spools years earlier. Always with the same attitude towards just about everything, Krapp does not change as he ages. His life is a circular cycle as opposed to a straight line. He is figuratively constipated. Fun to read and entertaining."
2,Disappointed,"Just like the reviews written here, this book started out very good. Midway, again going strong, then .....then.....then.....are you kidding me....did the same person that wrote the first 1/2 of the book write the second 1/2. It just did not do it for me. The comparisons to Cathy and Heathcliff are like comparing a rain drop to Niagara Falls. This book can't even compare to Wuthering Heights on any level."
4,Return to Bronte Country,"If one of the Brontes had written a novel set a century later, would it have turned out like this? There is the same harsh northern landscape, the same tug of forbidden passions, family secrets similarly buried, and the familiar situation of the rich bachelor a distant figure on the neighboring estate. But the sexual frankness belongs to a much later period still, and there is also a modern sensibility in the heroine's path to self-realization, not through others but on her own terms. This is a most enjoyable book, if not an especially deep one, a sort of Bronte meets Lawrence meets McEwan. It might have been stronger had the approach of WW1 been heralded earlier, and had the impact of that conflict not so radically separated the ending pages from the rest, but this is a relatively small flaw."
4,The writing is beautiful and moody...,but I felt it was tainted by the disturbing relationship between brother and sister. Worth reading for the beautifully haunting and atmospheric quality of the writing.
2,looks better on the screen,"I was not impressed with this shoes, very uncomfortable and they are not especially flattering on the feet. They look better in the magazine or on the screen!"
2,disappointing,"Thomas was given access to the church archives when researching this book, but then he was denied permission to quote from anything he read there. (At least according to a letter the author published later in response to an unfavorable review--Thomas ought to have clarified this issue in his preface to the book.)The result is a book full of broad claims resting precariously on slender evidence. Thomas' overly vague descriptions of archival material cannot support his conclusions.If you're interested in learning more about Eddy (as opposed to learning more about what Thomas *thinks* about Eddy based on secret information), don't waste your money on this book."
1,Do not get this album!,"One word folks, WEAK. Yes, it does have that nice harmony song that played during the feuneral scene, but the soundtrack does not have the song when blankman is giving kimberley Johns a ride on the blankbike. How can they do this! It's the best song in the movie, I assume it will be on the soundtrack and then they screw me. Damn it, If it just had that one song I would give this cd 3 stars. U know the song I'm talking about. It goes something like ""Pretty lady, what's your name, just come and take a ride with me."" That song was awesome, but of course....its no where to be found. Trust me folks, pass on this one."
1,Missing song........,"The song when he's on the Bike with Kimberly is called ""Housekeeper"" by Men of Vizion it's on here for download."
1,Reply,Thanx BiggieB for the info.that was the song i was looking for to.i love that song.but damn they ain't got it on there.Oh well thanx for the heads up.
2,Only played once,"Take this review with a grain of salt, as I only played the game once. In our game there was little interest in appeasing the Goth and some of us paid the price. The price ended up being that a player's personal economy was destroyed beyond repair, and they sat through the rest of the game watching others progress. They could never proceed again. There were five of us playing and by the end only two were moving. The first of the three who was terminally crippled in his progress was about a third through the game (by my hand) and the second- half way (kharma, I guess), the third- just prior to the last quarter. In other games, it's one thing to know you aren't going to win, but at least you can putter along and make token advances, but not in this game. You don't even get the satisfaction of getting killed! Nothing like wallowing in bankrupcy. I guess the bright side is that you could have a long opportunity to learn from your mistakes."
5,Fun dvd about cruising!,"When we retire we want to sail to places we have never been. This is a great dvd about the sea of Cortez. It is not an instructional dvd but a great dvd on the cruising lifestyle. Sailing is not cruising. This couple showed a lot of what the cruising lifestyle is like.Very enjoyable, and I just bought their other DVD."
5,Penultimate Goodis Classic,"This novel is Goodis's classic tale of urban desolation. Like a bleak, sparse George Bellows painting, Goodis' world is master strokes of grim description from torn overcoats to bloodied maws to swearing Santas. At the center is Ralph Creel, a lazy bum torn between his romantic soul and his animalistic instincts. Ralph Creel is a fighter, a survivor, a supremely Goodis creation who like us all, eventually gives in to life, to the Fat Blonde on the Street Corner, but not before he allows the reader to witness some moments of Grace./"
2,Too Vague,I wasn't happy with this book one bit. It was very vague. Isn't there a book out there that breaks down elements and explains what is correct and what is not??? There is for dance.
3,Good Product but Pricey,"I probably would give one or two extra stars if it were not for my dog.With my friends dogs these treats last from 2 to 4 weeks. With my dog who has jaws of steel, she can eat these up in under an hour."
3,Doesn't last any longer than Everlasting treat,"My dog enjoys these treats, but they don't last. The very first time he got an everlasting treat it took him a couple of days to gnaw and lick the rounded treats out of the ball holder. Ever since though, he has figured out how to get the treats out of the ball quickly, then chews them up like biscuits.Thought the interlocking screw-on idea might keep the treats in the ball longer, but I think my dog just chewed off the end of the central threaded stick and then easily removed the treats as usual.Enjoyable but expensive for the short amount of time they last. Also, not sure of the calorie count? My dog is an 85lb young male german shepherd."
3,Dogs love it wallet doesn't,"My chihuahua mix and yorkie mix thought this was great and it was completely gone in short order, the only problem was that this product is expensive for them to eat it up in less than an hour. It is more like a treat than something that will entertain or challenge for hours."
3,Lasts about 15-20 minutes with mid-sized dogs,"Product came exactly as advertised, although I hoped it would last longer than it did. Max time from unwrapping to crumbs was 15-20 minutes with our mid-sized dog (40 lbs). Shipping was great--it arrived ahead of delivery schedule."
1,NEVER-lasting Treats,"It took my dog more than an hour to make it through each of his first two ever-lasting treats. I thought the ever-locking treats would slow him down even more. Not so. Because the edges of the disc pieces are scalloped (rather than smooth like the ever-lasting treats), they don't stay wedged down in the ball as well. My dog can get the first one out in less than five minutes. You'd think the twisting ""lock"" would at least add some complexity, but you'd be wrong. As soon as my dog chomped through the first disc, he shoved the ""stick"" back through the ball, using it to pop out disc number two. It probably would have taken him longer to wolf down the entire contraption if I'd just handed the treats to him in their original packaging. Fabulous idea; poor results."
4,Harder to Remove then Regular Everlasting Treats,"Liver is one of my dog's favorite flavors. Therefore she loved this treat filler. She is able to pop out the regular everlasting treats within 30 minutes, this one lasted a solid hour. She chewed the stick up quite easily, but the flower petals made it more difficult to pop out the treat. I did not find this too hard to put together."
5,Worth the price,"Using these in the everlasting treat ball, it takes my dog about 30 minutes to get them loose and consume them. I have used the regular treats as well (without the interlocking bar) and she can pop those out in no time. The threaded bar makes it a lot more challenging for her!"
5,surprise for a dog lover,"This story is very touching as a ""dog"" person is won over by an unexpected visitor. Shared at Christmas time it is especially appropriate as the world is reminded of the incarnation of God paying us a visit in an unexpected venue."
4,Some good tunes that remind you why you loved this band.,"""Gods & Sods"" is an odd collection of rare TMJ tracks and some songs you may recognize if you caught the band in concert in the early '90s. Spanning their entire career, ""Sods"" shines on certain tracks (Big Gringo, Death Ray Machine) and falters on others (Even the Queen, Gods Make Love). One listen will have you tapping your feet, but after multiple listenings, you'll be dancing around your underwear on a Friday night with visions of Melissa Joan Hart bopping in your head. Turn this mother up."
2,Have You Seen Her: Their Greatest Hits,"To any and all ""true"" Chi-Lites or Eugene Record fans,This album containing the phase of greatest hits or best of... in its title should not be used because it is misleading. This album in particular although contain a few solid hits does not do the group justice. This album is only but a sparkle of the real brilliance of what the Chi-Lites have to offer. Please, please, please, consider the ""Too Good To Be Forgotten"" BOX collaboration as your only option. This BOX collection really and truly defines the superb talents of Eugene Record and the group. There are so many vintage songs that only could be found on LP's, but now can be appreciated again on CD.Do not sell yourself short.......Get the real deal! You will thank me for it, but more importantly you will THANK YOURSELF for doing the right thing."
1,Not Dummy Friendly,"This book stinks. It lacks entire regions of France. For example, it omits the Dordogne, which is a large, economical for the traveler, region of beautiful countryside replete with prehistoric cave art and medieval castles. There are no photographs. Descriptions of lodgings are few and good budget lodgings nearly nonexistent. Despite having such little information, the book is large, thick, and heavy. This is not a book to carry around with you during your travels. I'm not sure who this book is designed for."
4,Very good,"I am a native of France and I found this book extremely useful. It contains much valuable information on the technicalities that can make or break a trip.( For example: how to get to and from the airport, how to buy a bus or subway ticket, how do obtain train schedules, etc...) As far as sights and accommodations, I agree with a previous reviewer that it is a bit lacking. Nevertheless, it is a book I will definitely take with me on my next trip despite its large size. One thing that I appreciated is that although it shows some humor, it is not so filled with cheap jokes (like a couple of books of the same kind that I've read) as to make the content more annoying than it is useful."
2,Not as good as it should be!,"My wife and I first visited France in 2007 and again this year...didn't even bother with the book this year. Limited in geographic coverage, and not nearly as useful as one of Rick Steve's guides.Long on authors' opinions and short on details that are really useful..."
3,Not really what I expected...,Maybe I misunderstood the other reviews but I got this thinking it wasa good way for a beginner to learn slack key. I have over 12 years of playing experiencebut still was challenged by most of the songs. Not sure if there are other options butwould only suggest this for those who are not just beginners.
5,MASTERS OF HAWAIIAN SLACK KEY GUITAR,"The book contains several nice pieces to play on the guitar. More importantly, it gives you enough knowlege to conceptially create your own hawaiian pieces."
5,Excellent songs and playing,"Great place to start for those wanting to explore early Nat King Cole. Excellent playing by all performers. Some hiss from the master records can be heard, but to me it only adds the the vibe of the recordings. The guitar work on these records is pure mastery. Highly recommended!"
3,Passable,"This movie did not really have an original plot, premise, and result, but somehow it clicked. It had a feel-good atmosphere and wasn't too bad. It sunk in some places and could degenerate into a slipshod performance weighed down with mediocrity and preachiness. Yet there were sufficient spurts of activity and charm to keep the movie alive."
4,Good sized travel pack for excursions!,"I bought this specifically for a cruise to take necessary items with me on excursions. It clipped easily to a lanyard and was a good size to keep items like lipgloss, ID, cash, and camera in so they would stay safe & dry on boats and sand free on the beach. I give it 4 stars because the carabiner on it is pretty low quality (spring action not good) and is pretty akward if you want to strap it to the included waist strap. However, it was airtight and is easy to open/close as well as clean."
4,Works Very Well,"We bought two bags, thinking it would be hard to fit passport and wallet in one. We only needed one and it fit our keys to the locker rooms, passport, engagement ring and a men's wallet while we floated in the Dead Sea. It worked well, no water leaked inside and it really didn't get in the way. I wore it around my waist, bearly knew it was there. It is a bit more tricky trying to get the men's wallet out of the bag due to limited opening. I recommend this for use at beaches or pools where you are a bit worried about losing important things, even a compact camera can fit in there! I gave it four stars cuz it was a bit hard to get dead sea mud off the strap."
1,Not water-tight!,"Upon receiving the pouch, I was able to inspect the design of the closure more closely, it did not look like it would be water-tight to me, but perhaps I was too trusting after reading all the positive reviews... I purchased this pack specifically for our Hawaii vacation, so on the first day of our trip, I put my cell phone and my camera in the pack, made sure it was locked closed. However, within 20 minutes of playing in the shallow waters on the beach, the pouch was filled with sea water. Of course, my cell phone was instantly ruined. This purchase turned out to be a very costly one for me. On the bright side, my other new purchase - Kodak C123 waterproof camera that was also in the pouch, was not damaged, so that item definitely does what it claims. Please be careful when using this pack; I should've just taken my chances with leaving the phone on the beach under my towels instead of using this pack."
2,Not too happy!,Took it to Hawaii for a vacation. During snorkeling I had my passport in a ziplock bag and then in this waterproof pack but still it was ruined. This pack isn't waterproof. I would suggest taking additional measures before taking your valuables into the water.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this to keep phone and money dry while at pool park with grandchildren. I found some moisture does seep in, so I use a freezer bag inside the Dry Pak. Using the freezer bag inside Dry Pak has worked. However, after approximately 6 uses, the material is freying away from the yellow fastener bar and the seams down the side."
3,No option on here to contact seller or I would contact them,"The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. Ordered 2, one for each of my kids, for our trip to Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor. Unfortunately the clasp on one broke right away and it was a cause of drama for a bit, then we attached both bags together with the one working clasp and the kids took turns carrying it. It appeared to do a good job of keeping their things waterproof and it was small enough that we did not have to get a locker for their things when we went on crazy rides. I just wish it had a stronger clasp, especially considering that they are made for kids and kids always mess with things like that! Otherwise this is a really good product!"
5,Everything is dry....,"I purchased this item to use on vacation, and it worked great, nothing got wet and i used it constantly. The bag does have a tendency to fill with air, so just press the air out before you completely shut it with the black tabs.Very good product and great price!"
1,not waterproof,"This bag is not waterproof. Not quite sure how the people in the reviews i read used thiers, but we took it snorkling and it was full of water after 1 1/2 hours. Glad we didn't put anything that could have been ruined! just money and credit card."
1,Doesn't work,"Every time I used this dry pak in a pool or beach water would get in. I also purchased a smaller one, which would also let some water in. The only system that seemed to work is to place the items in the small dry pak and then the small dry pak in the bigger dry pak. Anyway, I would not put anything that can be ruined by water inside these dry paks."
1,Lost at sea,"I used this pack in Curacao while snorkeling. Had 2 driver's licenses, $40, and ships cards. The pack released from the carabiner clip and was lost. DON""T BUY IT!"
4,Works for the most part.,I tested this product by swimming with it in my pool and diving with it to about 10 ft.Then I took it in the shower to simulate heavy rain :)One drop of water got into it but not enough to damage anything I suppose.It think if you are not planning on swimming with it it should be fine giventhe beating I gave it :)It is certainly big enough to hold your cell phone and some other stuff.Another plus is that it floats.The sealing system doesn't seem too robust. I can imagine that it may start leakingafter some repeated use...There may also be some quality control issues judging from the reviews on here.You may just have to get lucky and get a good one.PS If you want something that's really waterproof get the DicPac WP560.I have the WP310 for my camera this thing IS waterproof.
2,Not impressed,I purchased one of these and did the bubble test immediately and found a leak. Contacted customer service and they promptly overnighted a 2nd one with Saturday delivery. That was awesome! Bubble tested the new one and seemed okay. Went on vacation and did some surface snorkeling and the thing leaked a few drops while I was out. I completely dried the outside of the case and opened the case on a horizontal plane to make sure I wasn't allowing in any water from the outside. There were a couple small drops on the interior near the bottom and my wallet showed signs of water. Time to find an alternative for next beach trip.
3,Functional but dorky,I'm sure this product works well and is in deed waterproof but it just seemed too dorky to actually tote that thing on my body while swimming in the ocean or resort pool. I just couldn't do it!
2,Dry pack,It did not work. I used it at water park and my stuffs got wet even through I put my stuff inside a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in dry pack
1,Bag leaked water destroying my 2 iPhones,"Be extremely careful when using this product with electronic items. As one of the reviewers pointed out, this bag seems to leak when ""overloaded"". I put 2 iPhones into this bag and it leaked while I was snorkeling, destroying both of my iPhones and taking with it all the pictures and videos of my vacation. This bag is big enough to fit more than 2 iPhones so it did not occur to me that it would leak with 2 phones in there. I would look for another product that has a more secured sealing mechanism. Because of this leaky bag, I lost $470 replacing my iPhones because Apple warranty does not cover water damage and a priceless set of photos and videos. I would not buy this brand of products again."
3,Dry Pack with belt,I used this Dry pack when I went white water rafting. It was an all day trip where we were allowed to swim in some spots and jump off the rocks. The dry pack was damp inside from what look like condensation. The belt worked great and was able to raft without it getting in the way. I will give it another try and see if it does it again or if I didn't close it right.
4,Mine Was Watertight,"I used the 6""X5"" Kwik Tek Dry Pack during a recent snorkeling trip in the British Virgin Islands. The bag is a little smaller than I'd thought, but it was large enough to hold my wallet. I put the wallet in a sealed bag also, just in case the Dry Pack should leak, though mine didn't. I had a little difficulty in closing the two sealing levers because the folded-over, gallon-sized bag that I put my wallet in was poking through the seal area. Using a sandwich-sized bag instead should solve that problem. If you plan to hold anything more than a wallet, you may want to go with a larger size Kwik Tek. This product worked as advertised, so I recommend it."
2,"Ok, but it leaked....","The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I was able to keep some things in this pack while I was surfing. But it leaked, so if you really need something that cant get wet, do not buy this product. We ended just putting my wife's I phone, but it has a water proof cover on it, so it wasnt a problem.I was going to put my insulin pump in, which is water resistant, it probably would of made it because inside the bag wasn't totally soaked. But it did leak."
3,Bulkier than expected,"It is a little bulkier than I expected, the yellow top is hard plastic, so if you intend to do water sports with it, be careful. I almost had an accident with it while playing at the beach. As many reviews said, this is not 100% waterproof, some drops will leak inside, so using an additional plastic bag is a must if you want more protection."
3,"Does the job, but be VERY careful when closing.","This pack does the job, but you must be VERY careful when closing.DO NOT overfill or put heavy items in it... it WILL leak!!!Great for the price to carry your money, id, keys and such... not so great for any electronics."
4,Beach Buddy,"Me and my wife went on vacation and wanted something to put our valuables in (wallets, rings, car keys) when snorkeling or going in the water at the beach. This was small enough to fit in my board shorts pouch and large enough to fit the essentials. It never leaked after 7 days of use, but sand did get under the locking mechanisms pretty quickly. This worries me and makes me think that with enough use, the sand my make the clasps open unintentionally (due to wearing away the plastic under them). A double layer zip and velcro fastener might have been better unless this is only meant for open-water scuba diving where debris contact is minimal."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this bag to use for protecting valuables (cell phone, I.D., car keys, money, etc.) while snorkeling in Hawaii. It leaked like a sieve. Fortunately, I put the valuables in a zip-lock bag before placing in the dry pack else they would have been ruined. After the first usage I took the dry pack off the belt and replaced it with another product I had bought to protect a digital camera. I used the other product for the duration of the trip with no leaks. Cannot recommend this product at all based on my experience. Maybe the one I bought was defective but I could not find any apparent flaws."
1,Not what I expected,i just received the Dry Pack...the belt is not attached to the bag so how is this belted?? Not what I expected at all.
3,High hopes,"Seems like a great pack, and was excited it came with a strap so I could wear it while swimming. Luckily I tested it before really needing to use it, and unfortunately the corner of the bottom of the bag leaks. It is otherwise a very functional design. Kept water out otherwise, but could use a reinforced seal or some extra glue where the ""T"" seam is on the bottom corner. A tip -- the yellow section tends to collect water between the plastic pieces -- this didn't impact the seal of the bag in any way and kept water out, but if you don't tip the bag on its end to let the water drain out before attempting to open, any water that collected will fall into the bag when you break the seal.I bought the clear bag version as well and don't seem to have any problems with that one as the bag is a different material than this blue one and has better seams."
4,Great little bag,I took this little bag to Bali with me to hold my money in while I surfed (wore it around my waist while surfing). It kept everything nice and dry. The only criticism is that it flaps around a bit as it dangles from the belt.
1,Broke quickly,"I had this for just a week when one of the fasteners broke. Even before that, it was very difficult to close."
3,Disappointed.......,"I used this when I went to a waterpark and put my keys, some money and a credit card in it. I did however put those items in a ziploc bag inside the Kwik Pack because it was my first time using it and I wanted to be sure that it was water-tight. To my disappointment, when it was time for lunch, I opened it and there were some drops of water inside. Nothing major, but I really thought this item was going to keep all the water out. From the reviews I read it sounded like it worked great. My experience wasn't that great and I'm glad that I had my stuff inside the ziploc, especially my keys that had the remote attached because that could have potentially gotten ruined."
2,Worked once then leaked.,"Bought this for a couple of cruise excursions. It worked great for a river tube float but when we snorkeled with it it leaked hence wet passports, money, etc.. If you purchase this make sure you test it before you use it!!!!"
4,Does the job - Keeps stuff dry,"This pouch did a great job keeping cash, credit cards and passports dry while snorkelling/swimming for several hours in the caribbean over the course of a week. Was a little tight for the passports though. The strap could be better designed - its just a basic strap that hooks thought the D-ring shown in the picture. This unfortunately means it does not feel as secure as one might like. The upside is that the strap can be worn in a variety of different ways so you gain some flexibity with the simplicity of the strap attachment. Overall, for the price, I am very satisfied with this Dry Pack."
4,Great item for a cruise,This Dry Pac kept my travelers checks and money dry while I swam with the stingrays in the Cayman Islands. Plenty of room left for a camera and credit cards. I would recommend this item to my friends!
1,"A dated schism of its own. Interesting, but irrelevant to current Klingon lore.","I bought this with the hope of gaining more knowledge of the Klingons. I had not heard of Gurps nor knew what it was, but in retrospect, I wish I had done more research. This data file is completely useless if you are looking for information centered around the current Klingon lore and mythos. Basically, the entire book is for the Gurps Prime Directive RPG ONLY. It contains nothing in relation to current language, beliefs, or novels. The d'k tahg, isn't even referred to as such. The artwork and the designs of the ships are lame. The only thing I found interesting was in this version of events, there is a lot of depth to their universe. But, nothing that can be reflected to today's more superior Klingons. Don't waste your money."
5,Laugh-out-loud as usual,Lawrence Block is able to make each Burglar book a funny yet convoluted mystery every time. I've read almost all of them and I am not looking forward to the day when there are no more to buy.
4,Good read,"This book is a good quick read, well-written and a page-turner. The interplay of the characters is entertaining and inviting, even the final ""Charlie Chan movie"" type scene where the characters are brought together and the murderer revealed -- the only thing missing in the book is the lights being turned off and the quick scuffle as the perpetrator tries to escape. The author uses occasional deft and subtle humor and brings in interesting tidbits from Spinoza.The description of the first murder crime scene (paperback page 78) led me to a correct guess of the murderer's identity.And strangely for a book where much of the plot turns around the type of glove Bernie wore for the burglary (rubber, with the palm removed), the cover shows Bernie taking the nickel from the safe while wearing a complete leather glove."
4,Worked Well While We Needed It,"I'm sure it would still work well , if we needed it . It outlived our PDA's"
4,Frevo Lives !,"some great tracks on this, rollicking melodies and accordion grooves North Brazilian styles : Frevo, Baiao, Forro, Marcha etc its good for my triangle practice !"
5,Great Item! TM Performance black Dodge Durango Oval Hitch cover,"Great Item, very durable...Shipping was prompt. Doesn't come with a pin, but considering the price...it is very reasonable. Looks great on my Durango!!"
1,Not so great really,"This thing is heavy which makes it a bit difficult to use when cutting your own hair especially holding a mirror with one hand. The 20.00 cutter at Rite Aid is easier to handle.Also, the smallest length attachment doesn't line up with the metal cutters and it has some burrs on it which tend to scrape the scalp a bit.Buy the cheap model and replace the whole shaver when dull."
2,Not as good as i thought,"This product did not meet my expectations. It does cut thick hair easily, but it gets hot pretty fast ( Andis cool care did nothing!) and its pretty heavy. This is not a good clipper if your cutting your own hair. I've messed up many hair cuts using this clipper. i wouldn't recommend this clipper, especially at the price it sells at."
5,I just paid $99.00 with extra warranty in a store for these bad boys!,"And they are great! I used them on my husbands thick, coarse, curly hair. It was quick, easy and like a hot knife cutting threw butter. I will update and let you know how these hold up as this is 3rd kind I bought now in 3 yrs. So I hope they continue to work well considering the cost. Also even with little light the hair was cut even pretty much the first time even with long, thick, curly, coarse hair! Not to bad on my hands either as I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. It did get a little hot at the end when I was done and making sure I got every where even. It took 15 mins for it to heat up and even then it was not as bad as my plastic osters."
4,very efficient machine,"This product is a very good clipper. It cuts easily even hard hairs. Can also be used as shaver. The only drawback is that it gets hot in a few minutes. But it seems to be very well built and I can guarantee that it works great in different situations. If you need a strong and professional one, here is a good option. I bought it about year ago."
3,Blazing Hot -- Not in a good way,"This product has a nice look. I mean who knew clippers could look stylish? The motor works fine, but I see no apprecaible difference than other Wahl adjustable clipper designs.The BIG detractor is the heat generated by these clippers. Because the body is metallic, it holds a great amount of heat. I have 5 boys, and by the time I got to my 3rd son's hair...I was hot potatoeing the clippers from right hand to left hand.I am surprised professionals say they like these...maybe they have built up a super hero like calous on their hands and are no longer affected like us mere mortals!Bottom line. While the metal looks great, I'd advise you get the plastic ones."
1,Clipper broke in 2 weeks,"Poorly manufactured product! Im a stylist and have heavy use, but only after two weeks they broke on me. On the up side they are pretty lol."
4,Very nice clipper,I am a professional hairstylist. I use these clippers every day. They work well and I don't have to go over and over the same section of hair to get a nice even cut. They are nice looking too!
3,It's a Christian thang...,"This is cute...the point being: The Ark was awesome and the Titanic sank, Period. I do not like the color--should be black and white."
3,I prefer the clear glass lids,"These casseroles are nice, but don't seem as sturdy as my other Corningware cookware. Also, I prefer the clear, glass covers as opposed to these white ones. On the plus side, they clean up just as well as I expect from Corningware. Performance-wise, so far so good!"
3,A Cheap Immitation,"Housesitter is an awful rewrite of the charming 1941 movie It Started with Eve. Unlike Deanna Durbin's character, who is honest and likeable, Goldie Hawn plays a pathological liar no decent person could respect. In fact, the whole plot of the original has been so cheapened that it's hard to accept any of the relationships between characters, or the final outcome. The two movies share a cast of characters in similar roles, and even humorous scenes like tripping over a living-room chair, but the wholesome quality of the original is totally lost in Housesitter. The film's only saving grace is the superb acting of its well-picked cast. The story line, though, has been shamefully distorted. I would expect a remake to improve on the original, but comparing these two films saddens me to think how far American screenwriting has deteriorated in the past 50 years."
4,Martin & Hawn a great duo,I love these two together. This movie is very funny and I think the craziness of Hawn versus the uptight Martin are great.Oh...and I love that house!
4,GREAT Movie -- For a fun family night,Housesitter is a great comedy for a night in with the family. The byplay between Golide Hawn and Steve Martin is great.Great add to your video collection -
4,FUNNY,THIS MOVIE IS REALLY FUNNY! STEVE MARTIN AND GOLDIE HAWN WORK REALLY WELL 2GETHER. THIS COMEDY KEPT ME INTRESTED FROM BEGINNING TO END. I ENJOYED IT ALOT.
5,One of My All Time Favorites,"I remember being 14 and going to see this movie on opening weekend with my sister, I was a big Goldie Hawn fan at that point and I fell for her big time after seeing her in ""Overboard"", another underrated comedy from Goldie's cinema showcase. Even though this movie mostly got mixed reviews, I loved it instantly and ordered it constantly on PPV until I managed to get my hands on a tape of it. It is truly hilarious and the comedy team of Goldie Hawn & Steve Martin is absolutely magical perfection. This movie has so many laughs in it that one would be hard pressed to pick 1 certain defining moment but it is well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh. Also recommended is Goldie's other hit from the summer of '92, ""Death Becomes Her""."
5,SO much fun,"I really love Goldie Hawn in Housesitter and think this movie along with Overboard are probably two of her greatest movies. I laughed all the way through. I also enjoyed Steve Martin. He and Goldie had great chemistry together. If you have never seen this movie and you like either Hawn or Martin order it, you'll have a lot of fun."
4,Good movie,"I bought this movie for my wife. It's a good, fun, happy movie. Light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously. There are plenty of quirky characters and the setting in New England is beautiful. Once more, there aren't too many special features which is a bit of an irritant."
4,I'd forgotten about this gem,"This is an easy-go-to movie that I continue to watch every once and a while. Goldie Hawn is playfully-dillusional and Steve Martin, though initially hesitant (sane), eventually joins her brand of make-believe insanity. Funny moments, and some emotionally tangable moments. Overall, the characters are loveable, bright, clever and charming."
3,"Ornament in great shape, box not","I recieved the ornamenent quickly, but was surprised that the box did not appear new. There were tears along the flaps where you could tell that it had been opened from both ends either repeatedly or by someone who was not very careful. The ornament was in great shape and did not show any wear."
2,not worth it,to be honest .... i had to return it because it was too small ..... not a true XXX lg .... the material felt very cheap
5,BREAK FOR LOVE,I THINK THAT THIS CD IS THE BOMB! IT IS A MUST BUYE TO ALL LOVER'S OF HOUSE MUSIC.SINCERLEY...
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"BOBBI SMITH HAS WRITTEN SOME WONDERFUL BOOKS. I FOUND THIS ONE BELOW HER NORMAL STANDARD. THE STORY IS WEAK, LOVE SCENES AWFULLY BORING, ("" I WANT TO BE ONE WITH YOU, THEY WERE 'ONE' ..OVER AND OVER ).THE HERO AND HEROINE, WHO IS A TEPIDPREACHERS DAUGHTER FALL IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, R MARRIED WITHIN A FEW DAYS DON'T HAVE MUCH PERSONALITY TO RECOMMEND EITHER OF THEM. THIS IS LIKE THE OLD QUICKIE 100 PG HARLEQUINS WE READ AS13 YR OLDS. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,What a joke!,"let me first say,I ordered two of the 1313 series.Billy the kid was 68 minutes of pure torture! The only bright side that came from seeing this ""episode of 1313"" was that fortunately for me I still had time to cancel the second episode before it shipped.I am at least thankful for that."
1,1313 Series: Nothing as usual.,"All 1313 series are the same: A ""Great"" review about the best movie ever!!! It is obviously biased and made by the film makers. Then I read many bad reviews of actual customers saying that there is no action, no trill, no suspense, no sex, and no love scene, NOTHING except plain boring repetitive scenes in which you see young half-naked borderline teenagers doing nothing. This series does not reflect in any way previous DeCocteau movies and genre. It was a way to make quick money. It is sad that they systematically add a great review to lure people into buying their product. Everyone is disappointed or pissed about these movies feeling they have been ripped off. I needed to react seeing those fake ""Great reviews"". Customers can use reviews too to re-establish the facts!"
5,Billy the Kid 1313,"My brother is the lead roll in this film, Brandon Thornton. Although this movie may seem ""cheesy"" i think its fantastic for upcoming and new actors! Congrats!"
4,Heard the Band Live in Chicago,"I heard this band live a few months ago in Chicago and was totaly blown away. I also had a chance to hear some tracks between sets from the original mixes. They seem to be different than what was released by the record company. I would have to agree that the disc sounds cloudy and distorted. Too bad. the stuff I heard in Chicago was on the level of a steely dan record. AAA radio will probably still latch onto it, but it's a shame that very few will get to hear the excellent quality of this band in the studio... What happened? Does this label realize how good a product this band is? I have to say if you can somehow contact the band and get a copy of the original mixes, you would be doing yourself a favor. I plan to to do this myself. I would love to hear these tunes again the way they were recorded....This band is top notch! Good songs and a great recording too, to bad the label had to ruin it.........."
5,A Beautiful Book!,"I loooooove this book! The photographs are beautiful, and the reasons are brilliant, too. Here are some of my favorites: 999 With horses, we face our fears and find our courage. 1 learning the secret language of the horse. 72 Standing asleep, one hind foot hocked. And there are many, many more. If you are hesitating if you want to buy this book or not, don't! If you love horses, you'll love this book! :-)"
1,Majorly Disappointing!!!!,"I am extremely disappointed in this new CD by Brule. I find the ""Gathering of Voices"" incongruent with much of the music. I don't enjoy the gathering of the voices--they are overpowering the beautiful music that Brule can create and play. I heard Brule in So.Dak and he is a talented and impressive musician. I have two other CD's by Brule: Lakota Piano and We the People. I thoroughly enjoy both productions. Lakota Piano is outstanding! I only wished Brule had put the same quality into One Nation as he did in his prevous productions."
3,Evolution of Systems Development,"This book is a good transition from traditional SDLC methods to prototyping methods. This book described how to integrate prototyping into the traditional SDLC methods. The example in this book is using Systemscraft Methods developed at City University of London, UK. The last result and look and feel of protoptyping in SDLC will not be much different as non prototyping methods of SDLC. The advantages is developer could reduce development time significantly although not as fast as rapid prototyping methods. Although it is not the latest state of art development methods, it is an important introduction book to IS or IT people who wish to learn about systems development from scratch."
4,great extras,"The bland treatment of the title story was disappointing for a young fan of the book, but all five other stories appealed much more. Don't miss the three cartoons on the Extras menu!"
2,My dog LOVES it!,"I bought this product to try to teach my teething pup to not chew on furniture and my fingers....Well, he LOVES it and made sure to lick/chew everywhere I put it on, including my fingers..... I also made the mistake of touching my lips with my fingers and ended up tasting the product for 2 days; it does not tast good! (;-)I guess it would have been great if my dog did not like the taste....."
2,Didn't work,"Tried the paste, but our puppy didn't seem to care. She hats the Bitter Apple spray, but the paste did nothing."
1,Dog Candy,My Yellow Lab loved it. She licked it all off her leg and waited for me to give her more. Big waste of money.
1,messy,"this product never stopped my dog from licking his paws and since you have to rub it on, its very messy. but i guess i should add that i haven't found anything bitter enough to stop him except a strong ""no"" from one of his humans. then that's when he goes off and hides and licks anyway."
1,cheap quality,The metal that was used for this necklace looks cheap and left stains on my skin. I returned the product immediately but I have not received my refund yet after a month.
1,m's review,"even though product was very inexpensive, product showed up at my house broken and falling apart. not a good value at all."
3,Pool's King,"This video was great. After watching this video I went and shot some pool and made shots that I had not made before and have then gotten alot better since. This video is filled with sections on breaking,bank shots and many more shots.If you want to be a better pool player then do 2 things get the video and play.Good luck and have fun"
2,He's a talker,"If you want to learn pool, buy something else; try Byrnes or anything but this for pool knowledge. However, it is a good insight into one of the best B.S. artist to atempt to play the game. Buy for entertainment only, not serious pool players."
5,How to play pool with Minnesota fats,"This is a very good video for the begginner as it explains the technical side of the game in a very basic way that everyone can understand, it shows how to play side, screw, draw, and what it does to change the outcome of the shots and what you can do to improve your game and help you to become a better player."
1,Awful!!!! Worst batteries ever!,"I used to think that all betteries were pretty much the same, that is until I tried some of these Tech B batteries. I have this cheap mp3 player that uses a single AA battery and will run for a whopping 2 hours on one of these batteries. When I popped in an Rayovac, it lasted for 6 hours. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Disappointed with these,"After reading the reviews I bought a few boxes of the Tech AA batteries. They are quite frankly a big disappointment. Never have I seen batteries run out of juice so quickly. And, never have I seen so many defective batteries. There is nothing like opening a new four pack you brought for a special day and have the first two die a fast death in the camera and then seeing that one of the two left over is defective."
5,Great battery,"Great Great Great!!!Definetly worth the money, the battery last pretty long, equal/better than the branded battery. Give it a try"
2,cheap but horrible lifespan,"purchased these for a photographer, and thought they were a great deal for the quantity. well the quality was lacking. She burned through most of them in one 6 hour wedding. probably fine for most household products, but not recommended for photography equipment/flashes."
1,"Old Adage is True ""You Get What You Pay For""","I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast. I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem."
5,super value,super value batteries. work great with all my toys and are cheaper than the major brands.i sold on tecb b i hope they make 9 volt in the future
5,A great price for a great battery,"My daughter uses a Cochlear Implant that has the option of being powered by 3 AA batteries. We have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest. We have tried Energizer, Duracell, etc. She needs to replace them every day and a half. Since the Implant is a high power draining device, every extra hour counts. These batteries are one of the best values out there."
4,Cheap and no too bad,"It is pretty cheap stuff. I did not expect excellent quality, however, in my speedlite 420, it works excellently, and supposed to provide more than 300 flashes with a focal length average of 70."
5,Claiming Your Call,"I borrowed Answering Your Call from a friend. I read it. I bought ten. I gave them to my professional friends. I gave them to my personal friends and to my family. I wondered how John P Schuster knew what had been dancing around in my mind and heart.Schuster has found not just a niche but also a gaping hole in the search for a purpose-filled life. He provides a framework for being true to yourself and for being intentional about your life choices. He provides examples and exercises to help the reader claim the courage and the insight to approach a call as a legitimate opportunity not as a coffee break fantasy.This is a book that is warm and inviting. It is reassuring and yet it gives the reader a kick in the ""Yes But"" part of his or her response to taking a hard look at how we choose what to do with the time we have ahead.John P Schuster is a gifted thinker and writer. Answering You Call wil not set you on fire but it will put one under you."
1,Disappointing,"Sorry to say it, but this book is crap. It makes little sense. It's more like a New Age-y, Stuart Smiley pep-talk rather than a practical guide."
4,Good quality,"This case was an afterthought after purchasing the camera 3 years ago, so I didn't have much choice, but it works great...I've been down to 45' with it so far. The clip is delicate, but I handle with care and have had no problems for several months of continuous use. Case buttons match all on the camera, but I do wish it had a rubber sunshade like some of the newer brands on the market. Glare can be a problem at shallow depths."
2,False Information!,"As stated below by another review this video CAN NOT BE THE ACTUAL LAST INTERVIEW. The interviewer in the video makes references to Marley's ""Latest album titled Survival"" Most reggae/Marley fans also know that Marley spent a while in German hospitals while fighting cancer before flown to Miami where he later died. The interview takes place in Jamaica which would have been before his 80/81 tour through the U.S. Obviously Marley DID interviews after this on only in the United States. Maybe the video is partially true as it MAY have been the last ""known interview"" in Jamaica, but certainly not his Last interview ever. The video does have some good Q&A not only from Bob but from other band members as well; however the video is definetly NOT worth the price listed above...Sorry guys!"
4,Come on now...,"This may not be the last known interview of marley, but if you fast forward through the introduction, its an invaluable piece of footage recognizing the 'man behind the name'. to my knowledge, the last known marley interview was in november of 1980, it was a phone interview. a small excerpt of that can be heard in the Time Will Tell documentary.i recommend this not because of the bad packaging and falty advertising, but because of the interview itself. any true Marley fan would want to have this as a part of his/her collection."
2,Misrepresentation alert!,"The ""Last Known Interview"" is touted by its makers as having been conducted in the spring of 1981, a mere three weeks before Marley's untimely death by cancer in May 1981. That's false. How do I know? Marley is asked about his latest album, Survival. Even casual reggae fans know that the last album Marley released in his lifetime was Uprising (1980). The video jacket copy is rather sensationalized, suggesting that Marley was on his final journey to Jamaica, via NYC and Miami, where he died. It is true that Marley passed away in Miami, but the facts are otherwise incorrect, apparently in an effort to tap into the rather morbid fascination of this reggae prophet's untimely death. As for the video interview itself, it is an intriguing, somewhat casual series of questions about music, politics, Rastafari and black consciousness, the answers given not only by Marley but by members of his band and entourage."
1,buy it,i dont care what st. louis man says buy the way i hate mark maguire those facts are true but as long as its an interview its exiting watching him talk because hes a legend buy it
1,Horrible translation!,This collection of plays by Strindberg is a horrible translation with a worse editing job. Stage directions are written in the exact same style as the dialogue and are very confusing to pick out and understand. Plays are not individually labeled and have no separation between them. The only way to know what play you are reading is to seach by other means. Really and truely a bad book of plays for the editing job. Do not buy this book if you can help it.
1,Do not waste your money on this edition,"This edition is truly awful. The first page of the book says that it was completely translated and edited by a computer without any human intervention, and it shows. It is riddled with spelling errors, has not been copy edited; the mistakes that were printed are so bad that it is difficult to read the plays. In addition, the actual translation is so bad that important points are lost.In regards to the overall organization, there is no separation between the plays. The first line of the second play immediately follows the last line of the first, with no acknowledgement that they are separate works.This version of the play may be inexpensive, but you will have to spend more money in the end to buy a different (better) edition of the plays."
3,As a young boy develops,"This story is a classic tale of revenge and, later on, love set in the untamed land of the Rockies. L'Amour does a nice job of using the appropriate vocabulary for the time set while keeping your eyes glued to the page. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys the thrills and spills of a classic cowboy novel."
2,"""Tuckered Out By Tucker""","This story is like ""Haunted Mesa"" in that it could have been written in half the time. I mean how many times can you be wounded and live to fight again. I do not like a lead character who constantly doubts him or herself as to if they are doing the right thing. I just could not believe how easily things fell in place for Tucker; I lke a little reality mixed in. I enjoyed the previous two Westerns that I just read by L'Amour, so I'll try him again sometime."
4,Glenda - L'amour Buff,"Louis L'amour is an author of the pioneering spirit. I am long time over the top fan of this ""All time best western folk and lore writer"""
2,Edward Bellamy,"I was curious about this book because it was mentioned in the newest Brad Meltzer book. It is described as the favorite book of the madman who murdered President McKinley. What I found was socialist claptrap. A privilage man pulls a Rip Van Winkle in 1887 and wakes in a socialist ""paradise"" in 2000. It is less of a story and more of a facile diatribe on how wonderful it would be if we were all the same. Looking backward also includes the sequal, but I am not going to waste my time reading it."
4,This is how children should be raised!!,"Little Heathens was a page turner! Mildred Kalish's story of her childhood made me realize, as a teacher, how the simple things in life are crucial to a child's overall development. In an age of high tech devices, we are truly missing the mark on what children need as tools for life's hardships. Hard work, discipline and an overall appreciation for our environment. Mildred Kalish articulated so well what was expected of her, the learning that took place and the resulting closeness she and her family members had. How the togetherness in completing daily chores with her siblings added to her well being. Loved the recipes and household tips! I now yearn for a day in her past!"
1,And what about the depression?,"This book was very disappointing. I had read reviews that lauded its descriptions of the Great Depression. Instead, it was a tedious recounting of all the ways life was different then than now. (""We put the wash in the bucket...Then we brought a larger bucket in from the barn. Then we turned the door knob...Then the Big Kids filled the large bucket with hot water...).We can appreciate that life was different 70+ years ago, as it will be different 70 years from today. But I wanted to know what it felt like when no one had money, when a great war was approaching, when people were leaving their homes for greener pastures.I'll have to find a different book."
5,Christmas Purchase,This purchase was made for the purpose of a Christmas gift. I had no difficulty locating the item and I appreciate the prompt delivery of a product in excellent shape. Thank you.
5,Little Heathens,"Reading this book, I relived my Iowa farm childhood. She is a gifted writer who made me smell the freshly plowed earth, hear the harnesses as the team of work horses pulled the corn planter, and feel the cold in the upstairs bedroom with frost on the inside of the windows from our breathing. I could hear the meadowlark singing, a song that I believed I had forgotten completely. This book remembered the positives of our times and did not dwell on the negatives. I enjoyed every page of it and although I lived in the other corner of the state, I could see her home as easily as I could remember mine. Highly recommended. Thank you."
5,A realistic memoir,"I bought this for my mother, who was living on a farm about 100 miles from the author at the time. Mom thought that this was incredibly accurate and great to read. We both loved the author's perspective; life was tough, but there was a lot to celebrate in the world that they grew up in. No self-pity, but great enjoyment of the good things that they had.Unlike other reviewers, I loved having the recipes and intend to try them. They remind me of my grandmother's cooking.I'm buying another copy of the book to share with my (adult) kids. They will have a better appreciation of their grandparents' world."
4,Little Iowa Heathens,I grew up on an Iowa farm in the early 60s so I could relateto some of the items this author wrote about. Good book.
1,In the minority here,"I know everyone loved this book. The New York Times Book Review named it one of the 10 best books of 2007. I just don't get it. There are chapters on frugality and outhouse pranks and nut gathering. Cold winters and back-breaking chores abound, but none of it held my interest. Despite the slimness of the volume, I struggled to finish. This memoir reads like an disjointed collection of encyclopedia entries pertaining to country life rather than a living, breathing experience."
5,"Good, Casual Read",Borrowed this book from a friend and thought my mother would enjoy it so I purchsed her a copy.
5,This book is a winner,"This is an entrancing memoir of days now long gone, but vivid in the minds of those who lived them. While I lived on an Iowa farm in western Iowa rather than eastern Iowa, and was a boy, and was about six years younger than the author, this book recalled so much of what it was like that reading it was sn unmitigated delight. The author recognizes ""the all-too-human tendency to gloss over the bad and glorify, or at least magnify, the good"" when recalling one's childhood, but it sure makes greater reading to read of one's appreciated childhood than it does to read of one who looks back thereon in bitterness. Thus this book beats, e.g., Angela's Ashes by a mile in enjoyable reading."
3,"cute stories, okay writing","i think the book could have gone through one more review period/editing, but for the most part it was full of entertaining stories. i dont want to pick it apart for its redundancies, but sometimes the author got carried away with using certain manners of speech, puns, etc. over and over again. also, there was a random chapter full of recipes that didnt seem to fit in with the rest of the narratives.i dont know if this book would make my top 10 list for the year, but maybe the new york times looks for qualities that i dont appreciate as much."
5,Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits,"A five Star book for me!Even tho' I was born in SD in '42, I could relate to many of the chapters, but ours was a much less difficult time.I have sent copies of the book to 2 cousins and a close friend from Iowa who needed a good laugh to help him through some tough times. This book will definitely ""take you away"" and give you the therapy of many good laughs. You will also count your blessings that we live in this age.I compared it to Laura Ingalls Wilder books... with the tough times... except the Iowans were surrounded by generations of family in the same location; rather than a family alone moving from state to state enduring those hardships. What a heartwarming wonderfully written book that you just want to share with all, and hope that it brings them as many laughs and as much food for thought as you got while reading it."
4,It stays with you,Thoroughly enjoyable.I have a friend who grew up in a similar way in Colorado. I keep wanting to send her the book and yet days have gone by with it wrapped up and ready to go and I just cant bring myself to put it in the mailbox. I guess that says something.
5,Simply beautiful.,"Turn off the t.v. and the computer and read this book! While plainly stated, the book is charming from front to back."
4,Little Heathens,My mother who grew up on a farm in Missouri and lived through the depression on up through 2004 told me stories of growing up on a farm and I found this woman's experiencies much like some of the stories my mom told me. Liked the book very much.
4,Very nice,Quick read and insightful if you are interested in small town life. Her hometown is close to me so that helped me enjoy it.
4,Little Heathens,"As you might expect of a former English professor and school teacher,the book is easy to read and is well-written. The author's reminiscences about growing up on an Iowa farm are interesting because her formativeyears were the difficult years of the Great Depression, when economy and making do with what one had were important virtues. She demonstrates the way in which the family was extraordinarily thrifty in saving and making use of every scrap of food, piece of clothing and spare bit of thread.Like a number of the books that have been written about people's lives inmore exotic locations, like ""A Year in Provence"" or ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", the author also provides some recipes that she particularly enjoyed when she lived on the farm in addition to when she prepared meals for afamily. The variety of home remedies are also fun to take a look at. On the whole, it is an entertaining book as well as a lesson in how times of thrift and privation needn't be unhappy."
4,Fun little heathens,"I read this from the library, then purchased a copy for my father-in-law, who lived through the depression. The writing style is straightforward with lovely language. Even though I've never lived in the midwest nor experienced depression living, it kept me interested. Wonderful anecdotes of kid sneakiness are described."
4,Beyond All The Limits,"Full track listing for ""Beyond All The Limits.""1. Beyond All The Limits2. Childlike Faith3. You Can't Put Out The Fire4. To God Be the Glory5. I'll Help You Cry6. Beyond What I Can See7. More Grace8. Lord Is My Banner And Shield9. Other Woman10. All Hail The Power Of Jesus' NameThis collection came out in 1994, and by this time I had seen Larnelle perform ""live"" on several occasions. His voice is simply extraordinary. The power and range he showed ""in-person"" was simply impressive, and though I am biased, I highly recommend all his works whether early or late. This CD has both motivating songs and reflective-type songs. A very nice set."
5,A Remarkable Reference,Looking for a quick introduction to the History of Medicine? This two volume set is an excellent starting point for those interested in the history of medicine. It provides a collection of essays by some of the most notable scholars in the field and adequate bibliographies for those seeking further information.
5,Nitzer Ebb at their finest,"I can not stress enough how much I like this single.I bought this single the first night it came out in the states, and I fell in love with it immediately.'Who We Are' is so damn cool, and the 7"" version of Lightningman is brilliant."
2,Not very toasty,"I bought this item because the price was right, it looked really cozy and my feet are always cold. After receiving it though, I can only give it two stars though because first of all, it doesn't get very warm very quickly. You almost have to stand on the unit (at least apply pressure) to feel the warmth, which is difficult when you are sitting. Also, I frankly found the massage portion annoying, it just vibrates and it also cycles through two different speeds (It doesn't have two different speeds, it just switches back and forth occasionally while it's on). Most of the time I don't even turn it on. It does work as advertised, just don't expect too much."
3,Not the same episodes as Dora's Easter Adventure DVD,"There are 3 episodes with this instant video. The first one is Dora's Easter Adventure, which is the same as the DVD. It's a cute episode which my girls loved. The other two episodes differ from the DVD version, however. The instant video version included episodes where Dora goes to school and Dora going on an egg hunt. The DVD version includes Dora's Easter Adventure and episodes about a troll wedding and a trip to troll land. Hoping this review will help someone else not make the same mistake, if the item description continues not to reflect these differences in the future. Rated 3 stars due to my daughters loving Dora's Easter Adventure, but would have bought the DVD instead if I would have known that there was a difference."
5,Psychology rediscovered,"Psychology: Theoretical-historical perspectives (2nd ed.) has a readable style elucidating the history of ideas in psychology. By providing a diverse range of chapter authors rather than offering readings dominated by the traditional perspective, the editors expose their readers to perspectives different than are traditionally found in textbooks.This book is well organized and written to address wide-ranging implications for the study of how great ideas have been obscured in the traditional presentation of psychology. The book provides a balanced presentation of the burgeoning issues within the field of psychology. I am especially pleased with the careful treatment of the largely misunderstood ideas of both Wundt and James, two early founders of the discipline, whose original ideas are only now being recognized by the field of psychology."
5,Great!,This is probably the best conformation book I have ever owned. It is detailed and has more information than I will ever need. The pictures are very informative and really help with understanding what is written.
5,Excellent gift item,I purchased several of these books to use as gifts for my horsey friends. Each one loved it. It's loaded with useful information and is well written. I highly recommend it.
2,Outdated Links,"This books is strewn with hyperlink references. If I had bought this book in 97 I would have been much better off, as all the links would probably be available. This said the book has taught me, a very inexperienced trader the basics of the stock market. The major lesson this book has taught me is that there is a lot more to learn. A CD is provided with all the links referenced in the book, so that you don't have to bother typing them, and an updated CD with all of the link working again would be great."
2,Familiar with the Internet? Don't Go Here.,"Even if your unfamiliar with the Net, much of the data regarding in this book is outdated. That being said it still may hold some value for those who are clueless. It breaks internet and pc related information down in a way that will help a novice in this area grasp a few concepts.If you need stock market 101, 102, and so on, then this is not really a good book. I found that the author trivializes some trading practices that could prove to be dangerous to inexperienced investors. It does give a decent general overview about online trading, and what to expect; however, you can generally get that out off of the e-broker's tutorials."
4,wilsin 50/50 golf ball,"Has all the qualities you expect from a ball that costs up to 3 times as much. Soft on the greens, good spin for approach shots, and long off the tee."
3,Wilson Staff 50,"Great product for the money. It won't replace the ProV1 but it's a terrific ball,especially errant shots, when you are shaking off winter rust or late fall golf."
4,unconquered,the book arrived on time and was as stated. the book was in good condition and I was totally satisfied with the product. I use Amazon for basically all book purchases and would like to see some of these oldies on kindle which I have used for years.
5,Great Traditional Irish Music,"This is an outstanding, classic Clannad recording. Many of these are traditional tunes or have that traditional sound. Interesting vocals on these tracks. You need to add this one to your collection !!!"
5,Great Album,"Arrived in good condition and quickly product in great shape. Super album, great hearing music from you favorite group you have not heard before."
5,Flat out Best Book on this subject,"I was really impressed with this book. This is an incredibly important topic, and the author is so immensely knowledgeable, and his handling of the material is so comprehensive and fair, that by the end, I felt closer to grasping what's been going on with American politics than ever before. It turned my perception of the whole voting process in America completely around (I really never suspected it was THIS bad). If you have any interest at all in politics (and if you don't, well, you might be past saving), you should read this, and pass it along, and talk about it. It's an eye-opener. And so entertaining! I laughed out loud several times, and throughout, I felt that the author was presenting really substantial, weighty information in an appealing, witty style. (It's a fun book to cart around, too -- about 15 people stopped me and asked me about the book after glimpsing the title.)"
5,Steal this vote,A neat book. Arived in a timely manner and it is too bad it could not prove a case in court and change a few elections.ThaksKaren
1,Got this for my son.,My son is 6 I bought this for him....it's horrible. Not only does the new look of the great classic decepicon Starscream look like total crap but it's hard to transform and has to many peices that fall off or snap off which sucks for a 6 years olds plaything.
4,Voyager Class Starscream,"This figure could be my favorite of all time, but Hasbro made a huge flaw. The missiles. They shoot out of his hands so easily, and the triggers are so hard to find, that you will probably end up shooting and losing one before you even figure out how to shoot them. I ended up flushing one down the toilet (long story). Also, I have only transformed this figure a matter of times, and already, there is a chip off of him that makes it hard to plug in the front of the jet to his back in robot form. Also, his leg joints are noticeable loose.Those are all the bad things about this figure. Here are the good things:He is very true to himself in the movie, and fairly detailed. He is pretty big for a voyager class, and he also has amazing automorph technology in his chest. He is also easy to stand up and pose.Over all, I recommend this toy, but not for children under the age of about 6. They will break it and loose its missiles."
3,it's alright,"I bought this toy for my son after seeing the feature film with him. I remember the original toy line fondly, but these new toys leave something to be desired. Kind of cheap plastic feel....and after having it less than three months, already shows some chipping. But I guess that is large in part to my kid playing with it all of the time, so that's good.The transformation itself is pretty cool, it actually took me a while to change it back and forth a few times. The joints, however, seem to be quite loose after playing with it for a while. i wish there were a way to tighten them with a screwdriver.overall, I gave it three stars, mostly due to the construction being a bit on the bad side, but my son loves this toy, so I guess thats all that really matters."
3,I don't think I will get another one,"My 8 y/o boy asked me for one of the Trasformers after he had watched the movie. He said he will pay for it from his money. I got this one for him from Amazon. He was very excited that he got it. I watched him and his 11 y/o brother trying to figure out how to trasform back and forth. They had trouble at first, but now I think they both got the hang of it. As a toy I don't see anything educational about it. And so far few airplane fins had fallen and put back (I wonder how many more can they take before you can't put them back). And realy I don't see anything spectacular about it specially for the price we are paying for these series of toys. I don't think we are getting anymore of them."
4,Artists--Keep this in your back pocket!,"Wonderful little bag of tricks for the aspiring artist, musician, writer, or more. The spells are very effective in clearing out blocks, summoning the muse or a creative partner, or motivation for that deadline. It also dispenses advice on creating a ""creative coven"" and sharing energy, support, and ideas. This is a good idea, anyway, as creative people tend to march to the sound of their own accordian. Whether you practice Wicca or not, this is a good little helper to check into and try."

4,I Was Seven Years Old...,"...when I first heard the song, ""I Love You"". My brother was 14 and my sister, 17. I had been exposed to much of the '60's rock by virtue of thier transistor radios. I had heavy doses of the Beatles, Elvis, and all the British Invasion bands. But this Capitol 45 was different. It had a refreshing sound. And the B-Side titled, ""Somebody Tell Me My Name"" was good also. Unfortunately it is not on this CD.I remember seeing this band perform ""I Love You"" on American Bandstand. They were energetic. I still own the 45 however, it is crackly and worse for wear and tear.While there may be some sentimentality involved, I genuinely enjoy this CD. It sounds as modern as any of the new stuff that permeates the airwaves today. And this group did it without videos!"
5,THIS IS THE ONE & ONLY ORIGINAL CD ISSUE OF PEOPLE I LOVE YOU.,"THIS CAPITOL REISSUE OF PEOPLE I LOVE YOU IS JUST AS RARE AS THE ORIGINAL 1968 CAPITOL PRESSING. NOT MANY ALBUMS FROM OBSCURE ROCK BANDS IN THE CAPITOL CATALOG IN THE 60's WERE REISSUED ON CD BY CAPITOL WHICH MAKES THIS RARE AND WHY IT COMMANDS HIGH PRICES. PEOPLE - I LOVE YOU (THEIR 1st OF 3 LP's) IS VERY DECENT LATE 60'S PSYCH ROCK AND DESERVES A LISTEN WHETHER LARRY NORMAN WAS IN THE GROUP OR NOT. GREAT PRODUCTION, VOCALS AND ARRANGEMENTS. ""NOTHING CAN STOP THE ELEPHANTS"", AND ""ASHES OF ME"" ARE VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF ACID ZANNINESS! EVERY TIME I HEAR ""ASHES OF ME"" I HEAR SOMETHING NEW THAT I DIDN'T CATCH BEFORE. VERY TRIPPY. THEIR VERSION OF THE ZOMBIES' ""I LOVE YOU"" IS A DECENT COVER AND IT'S DONE WELL. AS EXPECTED, THE SOUND QUALITY IS SUPERB TRANSFERRED DIGITALLY FROM THE MASTER TAPES, SO PUT IT ON LOUD! ***NOTE: THE IMPORT VERSION ON NORMAN RECORDS IS A CHEAP BOOTLEG! DON'T BUY IT.***"
5,ain't got the bread,"One of my all time favorite tunes is I love you. I am not only a fan of the song but also the artist. I would very much enjoy adding it to my collection of music of my era (born 1952), but I'll be damned if I will pay the outrageous price to own it. What my generation called getting burned!"
5,Flashback to a wonderful time.....,"Having grown up in San Jose,CA, where this group was from, I was able to see this group in person. I have an original vinyl copy of this album, which is worth it's weight in Gold. To see this group in person, was beyond belief. They could reproduce Beatle songs that not even the Beatles were attempting to do live. I'm talking about ""Strawberry Fields"" amd ""I am the Walrus"". They were spot on amazing!!! I'm just sorry they never recorded them. It will always be a fond memory."
4,"People's, I Love You!","There have been {So Called} One Hit Wonder artist's that I thought were extremely underrated and they had Stunning Hits and one of those artist's is the band, People!. Their late 60s version of the song, I Love You, is worth the price of admission by itself plus they had other good songs too. I finally found myself an alternate Disc of People! with this song on it (it's the, Long Album Version, and I love it) and it's called ""Best of People! Vol 1 - 40 Year Anniversary"" but because of it's originality; I would have liked to have owned this Disc. I have asked myself many times; why is this, People;I love You, CD OOP when there are so many other One Hit Wonder Artist's CD's in print PLUS I couldn't find this song on a various artist's CD either. Is it because this material has been forgotten by everyone except for the reviewers on this Disc?.....Maybe.....But that song is a step above many others (One Hit Wonders or not)."
3,This book needs some work,"The range of occupations Dr. Thompson explores is impressive: Navajo Medicine Man wasn't on my guidance counselor's list of potential careers. The activities suggested for teachers are inventive, and she cites recent sources for her research. But the overall package looks like a sixth grade project. Photographs are muddy, graphics are poor and separated from text, and sometimes just strange. What's an ice axe doing on the River Guide's page? The packaging detracts from what should have been a stronger book. Better documentation next time."
2,Too few finished pieces pictured,"Not being one of those who can visualize a finished piece from a chart, this book was a disappointment to me. Only a handful of the charts are made up, but what projects are stitched, are very nice, indeed. I just would have preferred to see more finished pieces."
2,Nice One Time Viewing,"Don't expect to learn anything of real value here... Nice s*x video, but we only watched it one time."
2,Old school and almost useless,"Grab yourself some online tips through a search engine. Don't waste your money. Since is it a Playboy series, they use it as a means to make more money. It is good enough for virgins who know NOTHING, but I don't think you'll get much from it.There were more annoying scenes between Dr. Roth's talks that did nothing to teach, only to remind you that you're watching a sex instruction video. It was filler and fluff. The talks that Dr. Ruth gave were in a setting with 3 couples ""candidly"" talking about their relationships. Seemed scripted.You might get a few things out of it, but there are better sources out there. This will just make you sleepy, or sigh in frustration. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it."
4,Great watch at good price.,"I agree with other reviews that this is an excellent watch for the price. Not as solid and sturdy as higher end chronos such as Tag, but then not expected to be for under 1/10th the price. Rich blue dial and good size, big enough if you like bigger sporty watches, but not TOO big like some are now. Would look good on any size wrist (I have a smaller wrist and still looks good). One note regarding the review stating the large second hand did not work unless in timing mode. The large hand is the second hand in timer mode, but one of the smaller dials, at 9 o'clock, is the normal second hand which operates normally. This struck me as unusual, but for me does not detract from the watch."
4,Seiko watch works just like a Seiko should,As usual Amazon comes through. My Seiko watch is as advertised and was a great price. Thanks.
5,Seiko watch,"Great watch, love it! Might get the black one too. This is watch #9 and have two Seiko watches now. The other Seiko is an analog 24hr watch, also a fine watch. One thing, it didn't come with any paper work. Was it supposed to?"
4,Very good for the $$,"Beautiful blue dial. Fit and finish on par with some $300+ watches I've owned. The crown screws in - not such a good feature for this watch, since the crown is fairly small. The bottom dial records hours and minutes elapsed. The silver hands can be a bit hard to see in bright light - too many reflections. The lume is very good easy to read thru the night.Overall, one of my favorite watches, with exceptional quality and good looks."
1,Buyer Beware,"On Screen this watch seems to look like a great choice. After receiving the watch, I now understand what other people were writing about. The watch ""feels"" cheap. Nevertheless, I decided to keep it because I had faith in Seiko to make a product that lasts. Bad Idea!!! after 9 months, the bezel and all buttons ceased to work. the chronograph is permanently stuck in place. After contacting Seiko (COSERV)about my 2 YEAR warranty (which amazon prominently advertises) I was told that I would have to send the watch in and they would send me an estimate of cost. In other words, the warranty is good for nothing. Well, lesson learned... don't always trust what you read and don't buy a Seiko!!!"
1,Disappointed,The watch looked good but I was unable to set the time because I could not pull the stem out without possibly damaging the watch. I would have had to use pliers to pull out the stem. Returned the watch.
5,one of a kind,In Concert/It Hurts tobe In LoveSome years ago(about 10) I caught his concert from Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut in 1999 on Connecticut PBS which was aired in 2001. I taped in on vhs at the time then later i burned in on dvd.If there are any copies(good ones) it would be a great thing if it was made available.I guessing that gene must be about 70+-.I will be ordering the above mentiond cd soon.
4,"Made for professionals, not for casual reading","I felt compelled to write a review in light of the earlier review trashing this book. Indeed, this is a dry list of things to do with no information on how to do them. It is NOT meant for general reading. All the books in this series are specifically created to help treating professionals write treatment plans (Treatment Planners) or create progress notes (Progress Note Planners) using language that is potentially helpful for insurance companies or other agencies that may require objective documentation. Some professionals may find these books of little use but the general population will likely have absolutely no reason to use these manuals."
3,Great Observations of Early America,"This book contains some great observations of early American life and attitudes. Also, since Grant was an Army officer out West for a couple of years, he includes some interesting descriptions of San Francisco, Oregon Territory, and Panama around 1850 if I remember correctly.Also, if you are interested in Grant's Mexican campaigns between Texas and Mexico City, this is a good perspective on that. It sure refreshed my memory on what that was all about.However, approximately 2/3 of the text is detailed descriptions about the Civil War, complete with every troop movement and minor skirmish. That gets old quickly. Thanks, Steve Willie, Olympia, WA"
5,A wonderful book,"The story behind publishing of the autobiography of U.S. Grant is as fascinating as the book itself. We all owe Samuel Clemens ""Mark Twain"" a debt of gratitude for publishing a dying Grant's memories in spite of the financial consequences for his publishing company. It is a must read for anyone interested in American History as well as the Civil War. Every page is a fascinating look into the mind of a great, yet at times troubled, true American hero."
5,The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant,Great book on the Civil War from the General who was most responsible for winning it. I would recommend this book to all history buffs.
5,A great book by a great man,"Grant had his problems and shortcomings, but this book is not one of them. If you like military history, and the Civil War in particular, get this book. It is long, but you are getting a lot of bang for your buck."
3,Do NOT I repeat DO NOT get this edition...,"Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible Memoir, but the edition that you want is the one by the Library of America. Yes you will pay a little more, but you will get a better quality edition, and you will get 200 pages of letters written by Grant, including letters sent to Lincoln and Halleck. These letters give you an even better insight of Grant the general/husband /person.If there is anyway at all possible that you can spend the extra $9 I recommend doing it. If you are on a shoe string budget then buy this edition. It is a 5 star memoir, even without the letters.I have a full review at the other edition, but I will say that I cannot recommend Grant's memoirs enough. It really is an awesome book."
4,Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant,Very detailed and complete rendition of the chronology of his personal life as well as his military life. I learned details of both aspects of this era in history.
4,Mastadon minus the Metal,"These guys spell heavy ""B O N H A M"".Awesome stuff, but don't confuse it with the Japanese-style hardcore band from Oregon of the same name.This stuff is hard rocking with saxaphone. That stuff is hard rocking with splintering bone. Not the same approach at all."
5,Great readings of all three.,"Leitner conducts this period instrument orchestra as he would if it weren't one, which for meis entirely positive (// Derek Solomons and Trevor Pinnock. That I usually prefer Leitner and Solomons toPinnock has little to do with periodicity. #5 is pleasant but unmemorable, unlike $s 6-8 (Morning, Noon, and Night-Haydn's then greatest symphonies to date. #54 is analagous among middle period symphonies to#s 44, 49, and 52, more than merely pretty and graceful. It includes a long and fairly somber Adagio among buoyant but somewhat less striking outer movemerents. It is surrounded by five relatively undervalued symphonies: #52,53,am and 55-57. Leitner gives it full due, dramatizing its depth as well as its vivacity.The Mozart #29 is also superb- it combines beauty and tenderness but never drags.Peers- Mozart: Krips/RCO, Klemperer/Testament (w/#41), Szell/BPO liveHaydn #5- Adam Fischer#54- Fischer, Solomons"
5,a good movie,love the movie will tell friends about it. it arrived on a timely manner. you will be recommended to friends and family keep the good work going. thanwk you.
1,"Pitiful, trashy and clueless.","The preacher's kid goes to see a ""Christian"" singer in concert he comes out on a catamaran being carried by 4 chicks and with his shirt hanging open, and then lets the women in the crowd paw him and she falls for him, how clueless can she be? One look at that and she sould have headed for the door."
1,DEVILS TRAP!,"First of all, I am not here to judge but evaluate what is evident about this movie. I did not watch the movie but the trailer.#1- I wonder why I did not know who Latoya was. In the real world she may believe in Jesus, but her songs are not written to give glory to God. If it is a real christian movie, like fireproof, I expect real world christians that are living out their faith in and out of hollywood should play the part. # 2 the number of sexual scenes in the trailer itself is just disturbing. Plus where did you ever see the curch giving the glory to the person who sing the song rather than the Lord. It is disturbing to find that Christians do not recongnize how satans are using a lil bit about God to get christians to buy movies. real revival my fellow christians that is all we need. There are good christians movies out there...... watching them alone make you want to go pray!"
3,ok,"This was an ok movie. It was a story I thought I seen before, but the acting at times was horrible, but has a good message behind it."
4,Good Movie,"In labeling this movie, I would say for the sake of argument that Preacher's Kid is Christian but with very worldly undertones; shoot, I have heard cursing in the most unlikely of places and in this flick, it didn't surprise me. I have to say, Clifton Powell, played his role well and that is a supporting role. Letoya Luckett was great. Really great; the guy who was her boyfriend, he convinced me he was no good from the door. Her father, the folks she grew up with, good. I really enjoyed the movie and I would encourage it to the young as a great cautionary tale. Now, in this situation, things could have gotten really bad. She could have never gotten back home at all, but to God be the glory, she was able to without too much harm. some don't come back like they left although we can say well, that's show business for you, but still, interesting flick."
3,Same Ole Thang,I've seen this first on the B.E.T. Network and thought it was kind of a alright movie.To be honest my wife love's this movie so thats why i bought it.Letoya Luckett really can not act .That's just my opinion.She can sing though.I feel like the movie overall christian theme was being forced to the movie viewer. R&B singer Tank can not act as well.Not to put down the movie as a whole it does has it special moments.I did find myself rewind some scenes on my DVR because they were hilarious.This is only my opinion.Watch & write a review yourself.
4,Didn't expect to enjoy this movie.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't really think it was going to be good because I saw Latoya Luckett was in it and I really wasn't expecting her acting skills to be any good. I mean I know she can sing but I didn't think she could act. It doesn't always work out for the singer-turned-actor. However, I was really impressed with her acting skills. The story was predictable but it still was a pretty good movie. I really enjoyed it."
2,Ok to watch when there's nothing good on tv...,"The acting wasn't believable, and you can predict the whole movie within the first few minutes. It's like a low budget Tyler Perry film. Definitely don't buy it. If you want to see it, rent it at the red box for $1.On one of those nights where you can't seem to find anything good on tv, then that would be a good time to pop this dvd in."
4,I LOOOOVE THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was sooo much better than I was expecting! It had me so emotional! I saw it on TV and ended up coming on here to buy it. It was so realistic and told a great story of how you can make mistakes but always come back home and be forgiven. Excellent movie! LaToya did a great job acting as well. As i said, much better than expected. :)"
2,"Starts well, goes downhill","This is a reprint of the book ""Songbird"", so check it out if you want to read the reviews when this was first published."
2,A MALE DANIELLE STEELE?,"AS A PERSON WHO HAS READ EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST,FICTION AND NON-FICTION I FOUND MOST OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE ""SONGBIRD""(ORIGINAL TITLE),MIA LEVY AFTER SHE SOMEHOW GOT OUT OF THE LODZ GHETTO TO BE REALLY STRETCHING IT! ON MANY LEVELS TOO.FIRST OF ALL THE DISTANCE FROM LODZ TO SWITZERLAND WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ONE WOMAN TO TRAVERSE SAFELY! UNFORTUNATELY,AMERICAN INTELIGENCE WAS NOT A ALL CONCERNED WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING SO FAR AFIELD AS IN POLAND WITH JEWS IN 1941. THE MASS KILLINGS DID NOT START UNTIL AFTER THE WANSEE CONFERENCE IN JAN. 1942.I CAN'T IMAGINE A PERSON OF JEWISH HERITAGE WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH GERMANS AND NOT BEING QUESTIONED. ESPECIALLY WITH MIA'S DARK LOOKS?????THE FACT THAT SHE ENDS UP IN A BROTHEL,DOING BEATINGS WITHOUT DOING REGULAR TRICKS IS REALLY PUSHING IT!THE ENTIRE 2ND HALF OF THE BOOK MADE ME THINK I WAS READING A DANIELLE STEELE NOVEL."
5,My Life in France,This little book is longer than it looks...it flows and is interesting...it will keep you reading to see what's coming up.
3,Julia's passion,While this book is certainly not a work of great literature it does give one a sense of the passion that Julia Child had for France and French cooking. It's a fast read and after reading I went right to my MTAoFC and cooked myself a delightful and very French dinner!
5,real adventures and down to earth,"I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Julia Child through ""My Life in France"". I love cooking and reading recipe books (for fun)- and can really relate to Julia's process of learning to cook and perfecting each dish. Being an avid traveller and someone who currently lives in a foreign country, I felt a connection with Julia and her husband. Their adventures abroad (learning a new language, making local friends, fitting into a foreign culture) were wonderfully familiar. My husband had gotten me as a present the book ""Julie and Julia"" (now a motion picture) but I found the main character Julie very boring -there wasn't enough of Julia Child in that book."
5,My Life in France,Anyone who ever watched Julia would like this book about how she learned about cooking in France.
5,An amazing woman,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julia Child was a warm, down to earth person. The story of Julia and her beloved husband was so entertaining. It is hard to imagine that she learned how to cook in her 30's. At times the book is laugh-out-loud funny."
5,Loved this book.,Very interesting and sometimes funny read. I enjoyed reading about Julia's life with Paul after seeing the movie Julie and Julia.
1,Julia Child - My Life in France - Audio CD,This is just a warning about the audio cd. If you dislike a voice that sounds like she smokes 4 packs of cigarettes a day and has a lisp-then don't purchase this. She can barely get any words out and I turned it off after 5 minutes. Read the book instead!
5,One of the finest memoirs I have ever read.,"A large part of that is thanks to her grandnephew, Alex Prud'Homme, who went thru letters, etc. to piece together a narrative that Julia Child then fleshed out, expanded upon and clarified from her memories and recollections.There was always just something about her that was honest, humorous, quintessentially American, captivating, surprizing, etc. and this book captured all those and many other of her qualities so that I almost felt like I was listening to her speaking in person.She lived an interesting life, met some fascinating people, in interesting times, and in some very interesting places, and she tells about all that in an engaging manner in this memoir."
3,Interesting yet Puzzling?,"It was in a magazine article that I first became acquainted with this new book. The beginning of the book was well written and a pleasure to read. However, the more I read, the more puzzled I became. Yes, Julia Child is an icon in the culinary world, but the way her personality comes across in the book is not how I would have thought of her. She is not sentimental and she says this herself. The chapters dealing with her father's death and her husband's own illness and later demise makes her as though she doesn't have any feelings. The last part of the book is rather boring, listing only people, the food the ate and the wine they drank. The picture she paints of France is sublime and wonderful. I only wish she could have expanded her inner thoughts with the many people who were so important in her life. It left me feeling rather ""puzzled""."
3,Refreshing but a bit slow,"I like that this book is written in letters from long ago. It made me realize that there is no such thing as 'the good old days', people and society haven't changed much since the 40s/50s. Better technology maybe, but we're still essentially the same. It was cool to see the history of Julia Child, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
2,Too much French,"While her story is an interesting account of how she became super French chef, there was so much French interspersed throughout that I (who speak English and Spanish) often was at a loss. Some of her stories even had the ""punchline"" in French. I understood that the recipes would have some language references, and since she lived in France, I even expected some French words occasionally, but this was over the top. I have it by my bed for when I can't sleep. It puts me right out."
5,Great as promised,"I purchased the book as a gift for my friend - we're big fans of Julia Child (and French cooking!) - and it arrived perfectly. The seller was quick in sending it and honest in describing its condition, which is always appreciated. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and cannot wait to send this to my friend! :)"
5,Merci!,"Thank you, Julia, for sharing your wonderful life with us before we lost you, and especially ""thank you"" to Alex Prud'homme for continuing the project and creating this beautiful book. The spirit of Julia Child shines on every page. Merci beaucoup!"
1,Good Start,"This book started out quirky and fun and had all the coziness of the movie. However about 1/2 way through she started in with her politics. I ended up not caring what the last few chapters were about because it was mostly her politics and her high opinion of herself. Her writing style was fun and engaging, but she should have stuck to the food and quirks of living abroad."
1,what happened to juila???,"am i the only person not to like this book? not the julia i knew, there is a sourness to it, and not very well edited . some pictures have captions, and some do not, some french is translated and some is not. Paul's painting were pretty good, they are refereed to but never seen . julia child had breast cancer in the 70s, it was a very big deal for her ,as it is for all woman, and it is not even mentioned. weston thomas"
3,"Not available, unreliable amazon","You give me the sample and then won't allow me to download the book. Does the (crappy) movie want us all to buy the book for their cover advertising? I think it's unfair to your customers to remove a book you have available in your search in samples, and then withdraw it without comment. If you are loyal to corporations first, you could at least show some goodwill by explaining. When will it be available? Probably once we don't want it anymore. Good thing I didn't buy the full kindle and only have the iPhone app. Unreliable."
2,My Life In France,"I bought this book for a friend. She found Julia to be unlikeable and the book slow and a bit boring. She promised to give it to me when she's done with it, but I think I'll choose something else!"
2,makes one want to be a vegetarian,"Julia Child was totally cold hearted about animals and indeed, how they were sacrified or slaughtered. Looking for meats for new recipes,she was delighted to come upon a rabbit soaked in its own blood. She had no qualms about cutting up a lobster while it was still alive.Her ""cookery"" obsession permeated her life and some of the pictures of France when she lived there are vivid. Julia too frequently peppers the text with French expressions, probably to reinforce how ""French"" she thinks she is. All the descriptions of the food, along with the constant reminders of her relentless bent for research and shopping, become tiresome. Julia Child is candid about who she is, but she is hardly likeable."
1,Would prefer to see a photo of Julia Child herself on the cover,"This book has been highly recommended to read, and I want to buy a copy for myself and for a gift. However, I am deeply disappointed to see photos of the film Julie & Julia all over the cover."
2,"""Great/New"" if you don't mind red dot on bottom binding","The correct book was shipped. No pages were missing/folded/bent, etc. There were several small scratches/marks on the cover but those may be due to an unusually easy to scuff cardstock and the fact that the cover is white. I was, however, disappointed due to the very noticeable red permanent marker dot on the bottom binding that spread across a good chunk of pages. It may not have been an issue had this book not been bought as a gift for someone. This was a second attempt at ordering this book under the ""new"" category that had this blemish. I will return it like the first. I guess it is common for books to have this dot, however, at first I thought it was blood due to the irregular shape. If it were me, I would put these books under ""used"" or mention this characteristic in the description."
3,Shocking!,"Now that I've got your attention ... I was shocked when I saw this edition. I have it on my Kindle and was satisfied with this even though the pictures are hard to make out. This paperback was bought for my mother, who's afraid she might break the Kindle if she used it. But there were no photos of the real Julia Child, her husband, her friends and family, or even of her kitchen and cat. I would advise someone who wants a copy of this book to buy one with the pictures. I blame the publisher for this mistake and what a whopper of a mistake it is!"
3,Handles French with grace???!,"This is a review of the audiobook. I'll say up front that I love Julia Child and that I lived in France for five years. The book is a lot of fun, and doesn't claim to be more than it is -- a series of remembrances of a treasured time in her life. If you like cooking, eating, wine and/or France, you will likely find it enjoyable.HOWEVER, contrary to the publisher's blurb, the reader murdered most of the French. I had to take the printed book out of the library to verify that I recognized some of the places she mispronounced. This will probably not bother you if you don't speak French and don't know France, but it very nearly ruined the book for me. I'm appalled that the publisher didn't bother to make sure that they either hired a reader who could speak French or find someone who did to train her and check the finished result. Very shoddy indeed."
3,Charming but something doesn't add up,"So...JC and husband are living off of his meager salary and yet bon-vivanting all around Europe, eating the finest food available nearly constantly, buying oodles of kitchen/culinary supplies. It doesn't add up. She must have been getting quite a bit more money from her father than she admits to.That said, it's been a fun read as we've eaten at a few places she mentions. Plus she was quite intrepid for a woman of her day and that is very appealing to me. So, I have enjoyed the book a good deal."
5,A Nice Glimpse Into the World of Julia Child,"After seeing the movie about Julia Child, I became curious about her life in France. Julia imposed the same energy and wit into the book as she did in real life. This was an introspective story of her life with her devoted husband, Paul, and their experiences in France. She interjects some interesting events involving the McCarthy era and post-WWII France. She freely offers her impressions and experiences with family, politics and Europe. A good read with more depth than one would imagine."
4,B O N A P P E T I T !!!!!!!!!!!,"Julia Mc Williams CHILD 8/15/1912 to 8/13/2004....6'2--ungainly,BIG and not very attractive. Her voice had to grow on you.VERY VERY SMArT!Married to PAUL CHILD in 1946. A great LOVE STORY. NO children.She worked for American OSS. At at one time was a good collegeathlete. Loved golf and b ball. Her nephew PAUL PRUDHOMME wrotethis book...It is about her struggles in France and her time at a veryfamous cooking school. Part of her problem was-she DIDN'T speakFrench.A NICE READ ! .... A special lady.Watching her on TV--I like most of her audience grew to LOVE her.bbp okc ok 63 retired"
4,Mostly a delight,Julia Child jumped into life with both feet. It was a pleasure to read about her adventures in France and in cooking. I just with the book had English translations for all of the French she used in the book.
1,Great Book.....but.......,"Yes, the book is great! I have no problem with the read......what I have a problem with is the shape of the book. Too expensive tosend back so I'll keep it but beware.......you might do better purchasing this book in person where you can inspect the one you purchase. The one I received has many many pages wider than others and some narrower than others. On top of this.....there was a bug.....a small one but still, a bug smashed inside one of the pages.I ordered this for my Kindle but wanted the book as well to look through the photos. This book appears to be a 'second' or 'flawed' that would have been found in the $2.00 bin at a book store.My rating is not for the words but for the shape of the book. I rated it low to draw attention to the kind of book you might receive. $17 + is not an amount I believe should have been charged for this. If that doesn't bother you, great! At least if you read reviews you are warned.Still a good book......"
3,A good book to check out from the library.,"I enjoy cooking and have recently been interested in Julia Child's work in the field. I also enjoy a good biography. The combination of the two in this case, did not turn out so well. The tempo was very slow throughout the book, occasionally picking up tiny bits of steam, only to revert back to the same humdrum pace. The information is all there, and if you are interested in how Julia's passion for food, and more specifically of french cuisine, developed over years in France, you should still read this book. But perhaps you should visit your local library and check it out first. My star rating sums up what I think of this book: It's O.K.... but only O.k."
3,Love to watch Julia cook....,"but, really...the only time this book came alive for me was when Julia was describing food or cooking. Paul Child's photographs were quite charming, however."
1,Warning...audio version a disaster!,"I couldn't get through the audio version.The reader, god bless her, was a disaster.She has a rough aging voice that does not lend itself to audio performance.Ouch. Too bad."
4,Interesting for Julia fans or travel nuts (like me),"I picked up this book when I saw that it was one of the sources used for the Julie and Julia movie, which I look forward to seeing, after enjoying reading that book (the story of a woman who decides to cook all the way through Julia Child's cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking), even though I was not a fan of Julia Childs before. I've probably never seen one of her shows in entirety.However, as soon as I started My Life in France, I was captivated by Julia Child's spirit - her joy for life and her can-do spirit.This book chronicles her late-start in her life-changing love of food (life-changing not only to her, but to others all these years later who have caught her vision) when she and her husband (she also got a late-start on marriage) moved to France.If you like travelogues, you'll enjoy this story of Julia Child's immersion and complete infactuation with France, its food, and its people."
5,Very Julia Child,"This informative memoir covers Julia Child's and photographer husband Paul Child's years in France, mostly Paris in the fifties, with humor, and her joyful experience learning the French way to cook at the famous Cordon Bleu. There are recipes and detailed descriptions of the meals and wines she and her husband and friends enjoyed. It's very Julia Child, and includes many wonderful photos of their life there."
5,A fun exploration of a Country and A Cuisine,"In this fun and refreshing, autobiography Julia Childs one of the best known personalities in America recounts a portion of her life in which her world view changed and her love of cooking developed and was nourished. In a very familiar and fun loving voice Julia tells the stories of her and her husband Paul moving to France for a few years where Julia discovers the life, country side, and food of France that will be the start of her Journey/Passion in life for many future decades.A fun and enjoyable read for all even if your not into cooking or food, simply because, all know of and will recogonize the voice and words, and enjoy the passion of a very well known person in the American landscape."
5,Hats off to the First Lady of Cooking,"This was a wonderful memoir about Julia Child. I especially found it interesting that she fell into cooking at the age of forty. Her passion to learn about cooking and gastronomy, as well as, her love for good food and wine were contagious. It made me want to get in the kitchen and whip something up. I think what Julia said at the end of the book, sums up what I learned by reading My Life in France, ""Learn how to cook-try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!"".While I was reading My Life in France, I watched the video ""Julia Child! America's Favorite Chef"". I found it to be a good compliment to the book. It was like a visual summary of everything I had read."
4,Fun Read,"My Life in France by Julia Childs was a delightful, easy read. Now I wantto read more about Julia!"
5,What an inspiration!,"I've always admired Julia Child. I remember watching The French Chef on PBS when I was a child. After reading her memoir, she has become a hero to me. She found joy in her life by doing what she loved. I admire her now more than ever!"
4,julia child - life in france biography,"i read this book and now my dream is the visit france to explore the food and culture as julia child did. this biography gives you a look into her life and lets you see what a wonderful, carefree person she is. it also demonstrates the work and effort put into creating the mastering the art of french cooking collections and definitely gives you a new appreciation for having a carefully mastered and tested recipe! it is also quite a romantic tale about her and her husband paul, which gives some hope that long-lasting true loves do exist! :)"
5,Wonderful book,"Although I wish the book had had pictures and the French bits had had translations I still can't bear to give this book anything less than the full 5 stars. The movie Julie & Julia was my only exposure to the legendary Julia Child (too young for the TV show) but the depiction by the also legendary Meryl Streep compelled me to get this book.Julia is intelligent, hard working, strong, funny and most of all tenacious, determined to get the most accurate information for her recipes, it really made me admire her as a person. Reading her memoirs of her time in Europe and her writing/TV career felt like spending time and reading letters written by a dear friend from a different time. I wish I could thank her for sharing her life with us."
5,"Love Story, With Recipes","This is a happy book. Child's joyful recounting of the first years of her long, successful marriage to Paul Child describes her discovery of France, and especially Paris, and food, which became her life-long vocation. Every line of this memoir is filled with energy, enthusiasm and delight. Moreover, and not incidentially, Child's tale provides a fascinating glimpse into life among the ex-patriot, American foreign service community in Paris shortly after W.W.II and during the early fifties. There are also accounts of the history of some of Child's favorite recipes; I took to reading ""My Life in France"" with a copy of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" at my side, and my family has benefited in the form of ratatouille, French potato salad and, this evening, leek & swiss cheese quiche. Definitely a rewarding read!"
1,"STARTS OFF OK, and deteriorates steadily","I got thru this ""thriller,"" after casting it aside a few times in frustration. Halfway thru the book the device of throw up a storm, find another anchor becomes glaringly apparent. I started wondering what was in the potboiler bag next to throw into the stew. On top of that the reference to the global warming hoax is tiresome. If you can stomach the result you MIGHT like the story. There isn't much in the way of likeability about the characters, tho."
2,Just plain lame,"When reading the storyline of Primeval, you'd think that it was a Sci-Fi Channel original movie getting steady rotation on the weekend, and it would feel right at home as well. Prison Break's Dominic Purcell and funnyman Orlando Jones play two members of a TV crew planning to get some footage of a gigantic killer crocodile, but instead fall prey to it as it terrorizes the African landscape. The first thing you'll notice when you see the beast of the film (dubbed Gustave) is that the CGI effects borderline passable and made for TV bad. Combine this with the cardboard acting (Purcell is asleep at the wheel, and Jones is the standard joke cracking sidekick) and civilian direction, and you get this exercise in B-movie mediocrity. It's not absolutely terrible by any means, and if you so desire to see Primeval, you probably already know what to expect here. Then again, there are better ways to spend your horror movie viewing time."
2,More CGI than Shrek!,The Croc was so cartoony I thought I was watching the sequel to Pete's Dragon. At no time in the movie are you fooled by the croc. When the croc runs it's even funnier than watching Steven Seagal run. The direct to video Crocodile movies look better in a lot of ways.
2,WHAT A CROCK,"PRIMEVAL is not your typical giant crocodile movie...it doesn't know whether it wants to be a horror movie or a study of civil war and unrest in Africa. But either way, it's a misfire. The script is contrived and a little tedious; the special effects are okay, but there's not enough of the crocodile. The direction is reminiscent of early MTV and a copy of such films as HOSTEL and SAW. Much of the action is filmed in the dark and it's difficult to see what's going on. The acting from Dominic Purcell and Orlando Jones disappointing; only veteran Jurgen Prochnow manages to give a solid supporting performance. Horror fans will probably be disappointed."
5,Based On A True Story,"My Oppinion: Primeval is a great creature movie. I've alays enjoyed these types of films.About The Movie: Primeval is based on a real life 25 foot man eating crocodile. The movie sets in africa where the thing actually lives. The movie is about a crew of news reporters who are sent catch the croc on film or catch the croc its self. In the middle of trying to get the killer croc one f news memeber played by orlando bloom accidentaly catches an exucution on tape and that they are now on the bad guys most wanted list. did a metion that africa is under civil war. well they got themeselves in a fine mess, Killer croc, merssinaries and civil war soldiers oh my. can they escape or will they get eaten, shot or beheaded. well you'll just have to find out.My second oppinion. Even though this is based on a true story the most scariest part is that the Crocodile is still alive. This movie rocks i don't care what any body else says."
2,It is what it is- a B movie to rent,"-Take the cinematography from ""Ghost in the Darkness""- Africa landscapes-Throw in the boat from ""Anaconda""-The guy from 7up & Mad TV for comic relief- with a few good laughs-A few elements from ""Lake Placid""-Some villians from ""Black Hawk Down"" (two plot lines going here)-Have the Crocodile attack either like ""Jurassic park 3"" or a serial killer.You basically have a Saturday night rental that you can leave on as you half pay attention and guess which common movie plot line they will do.It is what it is; not good, but not really bad either. The cinamatographer will difenantly get more work."
4,good movie,"a little comedy, a little action and one bad pissed off alligator... Ioved it when I first saw it and it was still just as good"
3,Not bad,"Although I had higher expectations for this film, it wasn't that much the disappointment. This movie would have been better if they had replaced all those scenes related to civil war with more screen time for the crocodile. This movie is supposed to be mainly about Gustave, a giant Nile Crocodile living in the Rusuzi river or whatever its called that has killed more than a 100 people. But it doesn't have as much focus on that as I thought. But I think this was a good film that its worth at least a rental."
3,"Great Picture, but so so content",It is an OK moive. Worth for the dollar (Discounted price $10.) But not recommend paying full price for it.
2,Torn Between Two Stories,"If two stories converge in a movie, that is normal, when done correctly, but one must override the other. Was the prime story in this movie teaching us about Africa, and our negelect of it, or about the giant monster that must be destroyed. Either story would have been good separately as different movies, but this movie did not converge the two properly. This movie was advertised as a monster movie and thusly that should have been the central focus. Primeval was not a waste, just misproduced."
4,Eating children is a GOOD thing...,"I was very pleased to get my daily dose of GIANT CROCODILE. You simply cannot get enough of THAT. News team travels to Africa to capture the largest known crocodile in the world. GIANT CROCODILE has plans of its own, mainly to eat everything in sight. Complicating matters is the fact the team is caught in the middle of a civil war between rebel factions shooting everyone in sight. A better horror film than Lake Placid, which really didn't have ANY good GIANT CROCODILE attacks, this movie builds suspense while also giving you plenty of GIANT CROCODILE action. Now if someone could satisfy my need for GIANT SQUID..."
2,Ehhh...Good...but Rogue is better...,Primeval is fairly good...however I found a better Croc flick...Rogue. I would recommend Rogue anyday rather than Primeval.
3,The end when the croc jumps into the rear-end of the 4x4,"I just saw the tail (lol) end of this film. I thought the shots of the croc jumping in through the back window looked awesome. Shot in silhouette was gr8. I liked the dog, too."
3,"""Lake Placid"" meets ""Sometimes in April"" meets ""Jaws"".","Primeval isn't a terrible movie as far as it goes. It has some action, some thrills and some drama, all of which are not given with an empty hearted attempt, but neither are they given with a whole hearted attempt. Perhaps that is the big problem with the movie is that it tries to be all three kinds of film and in the end falls just short in all three.However, if you are in the mood for a nature eats man kind of movie Primeval's ""Gustav"" may be just what you want.2 *"
4,lake placid with a twist,not bad based on a true story. pretty much a rated R version of lake placid. worth a watch.
5,Texture designs that are actually do-able!,"I have done several projects with this book. Its format is easy to read. Directions are clear enough to follow without being overdone. The book is very careful to list special products used, such as a specific adhesive, and any special tips if needed. The ideas are fabulous! I like it so well that have given this book several times as a gift."
4,Helpful practice,The book is really great for when you need a lot of extra practice and whatnot. Definitely worth it
5,Just as awesome as the PMP: Verb Tenses book,"Dorothy Richmond is so good at explaining grammar rules in a straight-forward manner. What I like most is that you're spending a lot more time doing exercises to use what you've learned than you are reading explanations. This book and the Verb Tenses book should be on every Spanish learner's bookshelf, no matter what level you're at. If you're thinking of buying it, just do it =) I have yet to go through her ""Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Vocabulary"" book. I hope it's as great and helpful as her other books."
5,highly recommended. Answers in back.,This is a very useful book. Plenty of practice with answers in the back of the book.I will buy other books in this series.
5,Priceless study aid!,This comprehensive book is packed is with easy to follow instructional material for grasping the Spanish language. highly recommended!
5,Awesome book for Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions,"I have Dorothy Richmond's other book ""Spanish Verb Tenses"" that I use to teach and tutor Spanish. I am bilinugal and her presentation on Spanish grammar has helped me identify English grammar better! Thought I'd try her other workbook: ""Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions."" It's just as wonderful. She does a great job in both workbooks on building on what was previously learned. Clean, concise and clear!"
5,"Muchisimas gracias, Dorothy Richmond!","...for making clear (FINALLY!) the distinction between ""para"" and ""por,"" for creating a workbook that is not only instructive but fun to use, and for keeping my hope alive that even linguistically-impaired people like me can learn a new language after the age of 21!"
4,Practice Make Perfect,This book really fills a need to read at a beginning but still meaningful level.
3,Cheap and sufficient.,"I use this book for my online spanish lessons. Its nothing special, but it gives plenty of exercises to use with my tutor. Plus its not grossly overpriced like most textbooks."
4,Good practice for the spanish student,"If you are looking for a good practice book on spanish pronouns; this is the book. Spanish grammar can be a challege for many, and this book helps to make it more clear. I recommend this book to anyone who's a novice spanish student or someone at the intermediate level. The practice tests are very helpful in this book."
5,Superb techno/dance,If you are a fan of christian techno/synth music you know full well there isn't much to choose from. This album is by far their best while a close second is 'Bubble'. Great female vocals and remixes at the end of a 3 songs. Well worth the money!! VERY different from their debut CD 'great awakening' which is more poppy and in my opinion quite boring.
4,Dai dai dai ku Maryu,This is a great piece of soul of chogokin. It's got a lot of metal and a lot of play and a lot of detail. If your a fan you must get.
1,Do not buy this item. Seriously.,"No stars. I did not buy this from Amazon. Seriously, this collection is not worth one dollar. The video transfer is terrible. Sequences are completely dark and unwatchable.So far, stick with at least the first series in the Cult Classic Drive In collection. I got one of those for less than ten dollars and so far it has been much more enjoyable than this collection.If anyone here gives this a good recommendation, the person must be a sales person for the company."
5,Excellent Asimov for readers with little time,I am an avid Isaac Asimov fan but with full time school and almost full time job I have little time for entertainment reading. These short stories are the perfect solution.
2,Nothing special,"As all the story books it has some stories really good but the majority of the stories are not good even if we are in 2003 and all the stories were written in the 1950's, I can't tell you that is a waste of time reading this book, but the end of almost all the stories are really bad, maybe you can read a story or two between books and you will like it more than I.Some stories had a strong message, but this kind of literature definitely is not for me even if we are now entering in the world of robots, by the way, about robots were only three stories, the others were ""out of this world""."
5,A fine collection,"This is a fine collection of the Good Doctor's tales. It's partly an excuse to publish a book with Ralph McQuarrie's haunting illustrations, but it's also a collection no Asimov fan should be without.Most of the stories have nothing to do with robots. However, there _is_ a story written just for the collection, and it's the title piece -- a short and haunting Susan Calvin tale that introduces some _very_ deep ethical ambiguities. You'll want to let this one roll around in your mind for a while.The rest are selected (and selected quite well) from the Good Doctor's lifelong output. Some of them are indifferent, but two of Asimov's own favorites are here: ""The Last Question"" (my own choice for his very best short story ever) and ""The Ugly Little Boy"". The usual cliche applies here: these two alone are worth the price of the book.This volume was originally conceived as a companion to _Robot Visions_, and Asimov fen will want the other one too."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,This Libra pendant was small and very light weight. I returned it because it seemed very juvenile and not what I expected.
5,The Little Leather Library,"The Little Leather Library was a series of miniature, abridged leatherbound volumes of famous speeches and works by classic literary authors. The leather covers were uniform in style and color. They were stamped with the title and author's name printed inside identical floral borders. The series was founded around 1914 and continued to be sold until 1923. Expect the pages near the covers to be age tanned by the leather."
3,"Difficult to read, important to understand","There are some books which are difficult to grasp and understand fully because of their complex content and others because they are poorly written. For me, this falls into the former category. I think this is an important book far beyond the study of literature and poetry. I was first alerted to it in a book by Richard Rorty who drew on it for broader philosophical and cultural insights and that is where I see its value. I have no idea if it works as a ""theory"" of poetry but it certainly captures one important aspect of the challenge of cultural and individual change and growth, namely that sometimes both societies and individuals feel the weight of their precursors as inhibiting. Bloom puts this challenge very vividly: it is ""the horror of finding oneself to be only a replica, a copy; or becoming only a reader, i.e. drowning in the precursors."" Is this perhaps why we readers feel we must write these reviews?"
2,Poorly made,"The shotgun shell for this knife was made from cheap plastic, and broke when i dropped it. The only good part about this knife was that the blade came very sharp, and did not need to be sharpened"
1,Not happy at all,"The description clearly states United Cutlery. In fact, I ordered two Shotgun Shell Knives. One green, one red. The red is United Cutlery, the green is not. If not such a hassle, I would have sent back. Frustrating how Amazon allows this type of practice to be carried out on their web site. But it is not an isolated incident."
1,too slick and slippery for the slendertone belt,"really too slippery for the slendertone and I constantly get the loose pad error,not a good product get some other pads that will work better"
3,Short lived.,The pads are sticky and do not last very long.Which the belt would work to help make a six pack butmine is more of a 12 pack. Stopped used belt as I didnot see any results.
4,The pads are the excuse to be a consumer for ever,"The Slendertone is good, works great, is strong, but the only thing that i dont like is the fact that you have to buy constantly the replacement pads, the way that you can save money is buying a conducting gel and you put it on the gel pads and you have gel pads almost for ever."
3,They are like razor blades....,"You have to buy them and they work, just like razor blades. I just wish that they lasted longer than they do."
2,gel pads,They are not the same comparing them to the ones I purchased in the past. I have to replace them quicker than the other ones. They are thinner.
2,NOT THE REAL THING!!!,"I ordered these replacement pads only because I had accidently gotten some lint from a towel on my original pads. Had used the original pads for about a month and a half they were still in excellent condition even with the lint, but I decided to order some replacements, BAD IDEA!!!!!! This pads were a very sticky mess compared to the other pads I hate I threw the other pads in the garbage. These pads meet FDA standards, but they are not FDA approved, there is a difference. I think these pads are old, they only lasted a couple weeks. Going to purchase some new ones, but not from this site."
2,Horrible glue,"when you take off the belt after exercise, pads remind to stay on a body, not on the belt. grrr"
3,gift,"my cousin wanted these for her husband, they must have had the machine that it went to , they liked it."
4,Good product,"Everything is as stated. I received my order in a matter of days.Don't know how they will work, but will give them a try."
3,What's with the C.O.D.,"I ordered the pads (in addition to the Slendertone device which I had ordered earlier) and both times there was a huge C.O.D. bill (in the case of the device, C.O.D. was about $60.) However, on the other hand it arrived quickly and in pristine condition."
5,Great Buy!,"The repacement pads for my ab flex belt works wonderfully. Same money from buying at retail stores. Was sceptical on whether ab belts really work but all I can say is WOW! My abs feel tighter and stronger after only a few weeks of use. Can see them contracting and relaxing as the unit is working. Want to save money and time shopping, then order from Amazon."
4,Nice use for after workouts,The Slendertone works absolutely wonderful for post workouts. I like to use it for about 25 minutes to help work give my stomach an extra workout after doing about 10-15 minutes of stomach exercises. It is a wonderful product.
3,Good product but!,This is exactly what you need for the slendertone but they can be bought cheaper elsewhere on the web!
3,Slendertone Gel Pads,The pads seem to wear out to quickly.; if you use the pad daily you are bound to get the warning.
2,Pads seemed old,The product was pitted and removing the cover from the gelpads practically destroyed the pad. I have purchased new pads in the past and they were always in better condition than these.
1,so...bad...,"wow. this book was terrible. melanie's character was terrible. the plot was terrible. the writing was terrible. jinx was terrible. i'm so glad that this trend was no repeated in following books, which have been a HUGE and welcome improvement.even though the series still stumbles, i've been buying these books for 11 years and will continue to do so. i hope that the editors reconsider their decision to end the series."
4,I Loved It!,"This was probably one of the best books in the series! And now Melanie isn't acting so bratty anymore.Melanie needs to find a new horse to race since her filly, Perfect Image is injured. She doesn't think she'll ever find another horse like Image again. But that's all about to change. One day she meets a beautiful chestnut colt named Hi Jinx, a direct descendant of the famous Seabiscuit! So Melanie buys him.But when he gets to Whitebrook, Hi Jinx starts acting up! I won't tell you the ending, but Jinx finally behaves at the ending.One thing though, in the book, Jinx is a chestnut horse. But on the cover, he looks more like a bay. Look, the books are good, but the covers could improve."
3,Tired of the Famous Bios,"I agree with another reviewer-- ENOUGH famous horses. I do like the bios (the Romance horse was good in Parker's Passion-- I always liked eventing a smidgen better) but the references are a tad too much, especially when some of them aren't correct. Wasn't Flag's Up Farm the farm where Alleged was trained? The Roberts farm? I don't recall all of it's stock being shipped off... and was it even in Kentucky?:sBut I do like the Melanie is getting a new horse. I was fearful that the series would be ending! The one thing I am starting to miss about TBs is their realism. In the first few (1-20) there was so much about the racer's times and running style... and that's starting to disappear. Still, it's one of the best realistic horse fiction out there, so thumbs up!"
4,Chrysler camshaft alignment tool set.,"It worked perfectly for aligning the camshafts, but we did not know we also needed to order the tool to set the correct depth of the crankshaft gear (which we had to go elsewhere to find)."
5,"enchantingly offbeat, the real thing","Not posing as an 'art' movie, but everything an 'art' movie could be. The mood is absorbing. The impossibilities are engaging. The music - 'Pistol Packin' Mama' and some seriously weird country thing presented as a recurring memory - is utterly transporting. The girl is sufficient reason in herself. The guy is cute. The spirit is good. This is the rare oddity that really works."
5,very helpful,my son has ADHD and its been a real struggle on everything... this book has helped me tremendously with all his behavior. Its been a slow progress but its getting there
3,Its okay,"THe reviews were great for this so i purchased having a son with adhd i thought this would be helpful. To me this is a good for if your unsure if yoru child has it, what the signs are. Definatly not what I was looking for but still an okay book"
2,not what i expected,I thought I was getting a book that would not be med pushing.I was wrong.This book was a BIG disappointment.
3,Not the best book on ADHD,"Even if this book gave me some new ideas about ADHD, I cant say that I liked it very much. I have read several books on ADHD and this one is just average."
5,What a relief!,I have two sons with add/ADHD and was frustrated that the doctors didn't seem to answer all my concerns. This book has helped me understand more and feel more comfortable in the treatment course we have taken. We have changed our kids diet and are implementing some stratagies already. This book is a must have!!!
5,Great Read!,"There were many things I didn't know that I thought I did. Especially, how to go about the process of helping your child, in school, when you can't be there. Super informative book. This was recommended by my son's counselor. I read it in a day!"
5,Best book on ADHD for parents,"Finally! A book that describes in simple, easy to understand terms, what ADHD is, how it manifests in kids, and provides some practical suggestions. I wish that I had known about this book 2 years ago when my child was diagnosed. The author knows more about ADHD than most of the professionals in my area who work with kids."
3,no title,"Charming, light read, with subtle dark overtones, particularly in the emphasis on the gradual disintegration of society. Author lives in Palatine, works for the Chicago Tribune, at least he did when his book was published. It had a fast moving plot about two widowed sisters, one blind, one addicted to beer, who drive to L.A. from Chicago. An enormous amount of unresolved issues, including domestic abuse, parent-child, and sister-sister relationships. Some funny moments. Never lost interest, but not a great book. Could make a good movie. Sisters were only 70ish but author seemed to portray them as 80ish. Why didn't one sister learn to drive? Why were they both so distant from their children? Was Ray gay? People in L.A. are all living in barred camps it seems. No real meat in this novel, although situations have potential for it. I still thought this way on a second reading six years later."
2,Repetitive,"Could be told in 15 minutes, but Jeff Kitchen repeats everything at least five times. Often not even in other words."
1,Tape eating problem,"I got two years old Canon Elura 2. It's basically same as Elura 40. I love this camcorder, very handy. Its low-light performance is not good but tolerable. The real problem is eating tape and losing data. It's not only for Elura but also for Zr10 and others. I believe all the Canon camcorders have the defect. You never know when it will start or not but I saw many posts about this problem. I'm not going to buy Canon camcorder anymore."
3,Size vs. Quality,"If you are looking for size, this is a great camcorder; but if you are looking for a camcorder that takes quality still pictures as well as digital video, then you better look elsewhere. I bought this camera because I thought the quality of still pictures could replace having to buy a seperate digital camera; however, even after changing the settings to fine the still pictures very not good. As far a the video quality goes, I am fairly happy. The audio is not terrific however and you will need to have alot of light. If I could return this, I would."
1,Planned Obsolescence,"I have accused Canon of holding a policy of planned obsolescence & I repeat it here. After just a few years of owning, taking immpecable care, & minimal amount of recording on this thing, this once-already repaired camera has died. The required part alone is almost half the price of the original price.I always thought Canon was the Rolls-Royce of consumer camera & now I'm convinced its the Edsel.Canon, you are disgraceful."
2,Tape Eater,"I bought this camera over a year ago. It has not had that much use, nor has it been handled roughly. The size is very handy, but the battery life is dismal, 30 minutes if I'm lucky. Video quality is acceptable, but I've seen better on my old analog camcorder. Audio leaves a lot ot be improved. Its very susceptible to wind interference.A few months ago it started intermittently stopping in the middle of recording and jamming tapes. Using a head cleaner did little to correct the problem, which got worse. Finally it just started eating every tape I put in it, so its not the tape's fault.I'm very dissatisfied that a camcorder that costs this much has such little longevity before needing repair."
1,No Canon Camera anymore for me,"After owning the Elura MC 40 for 10 months and taping not even 6 hours the infamous 'Remove the cassette' error started to apear and the data on the tape was garbled and completely unuseable.After doing some research on the internet I found out, that many cameras of canon have this problem.Unfortunatly the local Canon Customer Service refused to even look at the camera as it was purchased in the U.S. - ""You don't expect us to order the spare parts for you?"" was all they told me.I really regret spending a lot of money for a camera that can now only be used for taking low quality pics."
1,Tape Eating/Scrambling Problems - DO NOT BUY CANON,"I'm a little late in the game here -- after taping for about a year - going back and looking at the video now, I am crushed - missed my son's birth, baptism, husband's 40th birthday, and the list goes on and on. The tapes are all scrambled -- the camera store told me that the heads were dirty - NOT. I am continuously having this problem - missing event after event. I had to break out my old Sony Recorder (bought in 1986) to make sure I didn't missed Christmas morning with my children. I will NEVER by anything CANON again. They do not stand behind their product -- by the way -- this happened 1 month after the warranty expired!"
2,Malfunctions Malfunctions,"The zooming feature on this camera I purchased went haywire. The camera would constantly zoom in on everything unless I held the W down, causing great annoyance. Other malfunctions such as on the LCD, the ""no memory card inserted"" symbol would light up even after its proper insertion and formatting."
2,this is an outdoor only camera,when i first saw how grainy low light videos became i thoughti was doing something wrong. i then exchanged this fora sony DCR-TRV840 and the difference is night and day.i say save yourself some trouble and buy a sony.
1,Tape eating problems,"I bought my Elura 40MC 1.5 years ago. For the first year it worked fine. However, after the warranty ran out I began to have the notorious ""tape eating problem"" that everyone is talking about. I would steer clear of this product since Canon is reluctant to do anything about it."
2,noise problem,this one is like the zr 45mc. it has the high pitch motor noise being recorded and it is really irritating. recording will also appear grainy on low light or even indoor. use it only outdoor. buy sony to save you from trouble.
5,My son can't get enough of this DVD!,"I borrowed this DVD from the library because my 4 year old son is named Danny and he loves dinosaurs. He has watched it continuously for the past few days, and now I find I'd better buy it. The title story isn't his favorite, though. He loves the Island of the Scog, which is a cute little story with a surprise ending. He also enjoys Stanley and the Dinosaur, which I find quite frightening, with scary-looking cavemen and a scary-sounding narrator. But it has a good message."
1,Golden Greats/This is Gene Pitney,"I own the original LP version of ""This is Gene Pitney"" from the sixties. It is a two album set that has a playlist of 24 songs.The cover art shown is from the original LP, but the playlist shown for this product is not the complete one from the original. Buyer beware!!"
3,"difficult for ""big note""","The songs in this book are great and there are plenty of them. However, when I see the words ""big note,"" it generally means that the songs are incredibly easy--usually without much that involves both hands playing at the same time. These songs are easy (and, yes, the notes are bigger). They are also arranged nicely so that you sound more advanced than you are when playing, but I would have called it Easy Piano. It is beyond the skill of the person for whom I was buying it and I'm kind of frustrated about that. I guess that's what I get for buying music online when I can't look at more than the first page."
3,big book of solos,"Many students of mine have this book. The postivie is that it is indeed easy for them- young children with a couple years of lessons under their belt are able to play many of these songs.The negative is that there are very few songs the children recognize- alot of songs from movies of the 70's are included.The songs they do recognize, they love ( pink panther theme, jeopardy theme, the lion sleeps tonight)"
3,Play Under Review,"When I bought this, I was sort of expecting a ""case"". But however, that wasn't the case. No pun intended. Ok, maybe it was. However, it's simple a ""flap"". Being in the Army, I carry my PSP in my cargo pocket. This case didn't help protect my screen, and it actually scratched it a bit. Luckily I had a saftey sticker over my screen. Also, the flaps that open up, can sometimes get in the way of the right arrow button, and the square button. It could have been designed a bit better. While it isn't horrible, I'd say to look elsewhere for a case."
3,PSP Case,i SHOULD HAVE READ THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM BEFORE I BOUGHT. I DOES IT'S PURPOSE. WOULD BUY FROM SELLER IN THE FUTURE.
3,Bosnian Language,This is not very comprehensive Bosnian-English Dictionary but it serves a beginners purpose to start learning the language. It may not be the perfect introduction into Bosnian language (there are better Bosnian-English dictionaries out there) but it is concise and useful tool.
2,Is there really a need?,"One could argue the need for a Bosnian dictionary - there are quite a few (dialectical?) differences between Bosnian and the manners of speaking in Croatia, Serbian, and Montenegro. But this dictionary is next to useless because it lacks anything beyond word-to-word translations, not taking into consideration the intricacies and double meanings in either English or Bosnian speach, such as homonyms or words with more than one meaning.Anyone interested in learning Bosnian is better off buying a decent Serbian, Croatian or Serbo-Croatian dictionary (Bosnian tends to lean towards Serbian vocabulary and Croatian pronunciation) and find a native speaker to guide him or her."
3,ah nostalgia,"i purchased these for my 90 year old mother,and as i watched them,i was amazed at how funny we used to find these episodes.The 50's were a much simpler and free-er(?) time to live.I recall really looking forward to these sitcoms,when our whole family would gather 'round our tiny black and white tv,just to giggle together.(my mother loves them)"
1,Author Needs Experience in the Field,"I purchased this title hoping to garner some useful points that I can use in my job. Sadly, this turned out to be another book written by an academic -- someone without much experience in the field. You would be better served to find another title."
5,Wonderful!!!!!,"I was turned on to the P&P sequels a while back. I've tried to read every one written. I found this one on another Amazon customers listmania. I managed to borrow a copy from my library through an inter-library loan. It was worth the effort. This book was by far the BEST sequel I have read (and I have read dozens!). The characters were true, the plotlines well shaped. I recommend this book to any Austen enthusiast. I am trying to talk myself into spending $300 to have a copy of my own (I enjoyed it that much!)."
3,different than the picture,"Just a warning... the case is different than the one pictured and the shipping cost is as much as the case. The case I recieved did not have a shoulder strap but rather it has a loop on it that you could thread onto your belt. I do like the case, it seems to protect the camera well. My Canon A70 Camera fits great into the case. I just wish I had the shoulder strap."
3,Great for smaller camera,This camera case is a little too small - but fits in with effort. The concept is good. I'm using it for a Canon Powershot SX130 which just fits in with a squeeze. The strap is handy and a great length.
3,Some good notes,"This book has a few good notes of things you should pay attention too but over time I have found I rarely go to it. The number of sample contracts you receive is good and worth the money if you need samples to work from. I found ""Contracts Companion for Writers"" to be a better starting point because it included finished contracts...so you could see where most company were starting as far as numbers and percentages go."
2,Business and Legal Forms for Author's & Self-Publishers,"I must say I was rather dissappointed. This is not complete and happens to be lacking in my specific areas of need ie.General Releases, Interview and Photo Releases. I shoved it in my bookcase in the hopes that further down the road something might be useful."
4,Pretty good!,"The reason I give this 4 out of 5 stars id after a while it's been starting to get small cracks in it, after months of use its still fine, but I'm kind of afraid it will come a day that it will just crumble when I play a high ""c"" or something. I'll pick up a spare in the future.Otherwise this product is great, a lot more comfortable than metal. (Strictly opinion, others may disagree)Fits comfortably after a while, and doesn't get cold on those breezy marching band nights."
1,Emits foul chemical odor,"I purchased one of these for my wife for Christmas last year. After getting it in the house we wondered what the SMELL was. It turns out to be related to this mat. We left it outside when we could for the first month or two, unzipped, hoping the nasty chemical odor would go away. It never did. It was strong enough that you could sense it when you walked in the room, and we didn't want to be in the same room with it. The smell seems to come from the foam inside the zipped sections. I can't tell you what it is, but you won't like it.The mat spent the summer outside and is now out in the shed. It's been unzipped for months and it still smells. It will go to the Goodwill or the dump. This is another great example of Chinese junk that's not worth the money you spend on it, and it may carry additional health risks as well. Don't buy this to exercise to keep healthy. Go breath some clean air instead!"
3,meduim quality,This mat folds nice and seems well built.If you lay on it flat it supports your weight.Knee's and elbow's compress the foam enough to feel the floor.If you plan to use it a lot maybe get one with firmer foam.
3,Soft puppet,"This is a very soft froggy puppet. It is durably made. The head is overstuffed and the opening into it is difficult to maneuver into, even for an adult, let alone a preschooler. Was not a big hit with my toddler, though she does love puppets in general. Got highly rated from the Oppenheim list, but it just sits in the bottom of our toy bin."
1,Wrong time,"I bought this watch about 2 months ago. I found it very nice from the description and I order it. But when I see it, it was much thicker than I expected from the picture.The second problem (and the most important) was the time keeping. It's loosing aprox 10 min in 2 days!!! This make the watch unusable. Too bad for Timex who has a good reputation on the market."
3,good timepiece but ....,"the watch keeps good time, can be clearly read at night but the compass which was what i bought it for can give you the wrong heading. on three separate occasions i got wrong headings."
2,Ken's new watch,The indiglo feature quit working after 28 days so I sent the watch in to be repaired. That feature was repaired but now the compass feature does not work. Each time I send my watch in it costs me $7.00 plus postage of $4+. I will send it in again to get it fixed but I would not buy another one. By the way...it keeps perfect time.Ken Pettitt
4,Expedition E-Compass Watch,"I wanted a sturdy, water resistant watch that also had a compass function. This seems to be meeting most of my needs so far! The watch is a bit heavier and thicker than I expected based on the pictures, but I've gotten used to that. I like the stainless steel band and generally the look of the watch. If I had my druthers on what I'd change, I would eliminate the prominent minute markers, and I'd want the calendar function to be automatic. The prominent minute markers make the watch face a bit too busy and the calendar function has to be reset each month. I haven't really put the compass to the test yet, but it seems to work generally! Overall, I'm comfortable giving it 4 out of 5 stars!"
3,Know basic underwater & land photo skills before reading.,"Mr. Wu primarily covers the difference in the photographic requirements underwater as compared to land photography including the effects of using a specific manufacturer's film. If your knowledge of photography basics is minimal you will be best served to grasp these elsewhere before reading this concisely written book. He all but eliminates the clutter of the basics. I felt he may have been too brief. It is definitely not exhaustive. I think that more examples of the various lenses available and their effects, camera manufacturers who make special cameras for this purpose, and lighting requirements that exist underwater could have been expanded without going beyond the scope of the writer's intent. If you need or want more detail, then this book is not for you. Overall, I think it's a good refresher book."
1,very basic,"doesn't give any advice for seasoned photogs. Was looking for light placement...specifics of film ratings vs light position vs full or qtr power, etc for specific lenses/situations. Nothing there."
3,Hair Coloring : A Hands-on Approach,"Hair Coloring: A Hands on Approach is a very informing book. It helps you to understand the difficulties of hair coloring. Patricia Spencer (the author) is very detailed when it comes to explaining the different techniques and procedures of hair coloring. If you knew nothing about hair color and you were to read her book, you would think that you were an expert. The author also explains the how to remove hair color, the different products to use and how to use them. I thought this book was very helpful to me when I needed information in career training. It's a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who is an up and coming cosmetologist. maxince.curry@greatoaks.com"
4,Great watch,"This is a great beater, the bracelet could be alot better, i went ahead & changed out the bracelet...much better now. Great buy."
5,Seiko SND253,"I bought this watch for everyday use. So far, it has been a great watch, easy to see the dial and hardly any maintenance. Just wipe entire watch with soft cloth every other day or so. Unlike automatic watches, like a Rolex submariner which requires shaking once a while, it does not need anything. Quartz mechanism is proven and reliable for accuracy. I'll probably sell my Submariner. This watch is a keeper. Also, I don't have to be overcautious to keep eye on the watch from possible loss or drops."
5,"Great watch, better price!","I lucked out and got this watch for $40 less than it is now!! I don't know why, but Amazon had it on sale for about a day at $95 and I snatched it up! Great watch!! It looks like a $500 watch easy. Keeps good time. Nice weight and feel to it. Can't recommend enough."
4,everyday watch,"First, read the instructions before attempting to use this watch, particularly the part about unscrewing the crown before setting the watch.This is a good choice at the price for everyday use."
1,Not a good experience,"I bought this watch only to find out it was being shipped from Malaysia not the US. The kicker was that 4 days after this company got my Credit Card information I got a call from my card establishment to tell me someone in MALAYSIA had made a copy of my Mastercard and tried to use it at a local Tesco. Not a phone order mind you, with an almost exact copy of my card that was hand swiped at a Tesco. Needless to say I had to cancel my card and update all of my internet shopping sites etc -- it was a real pain. The watch (before the c/c theft fiasco happened) was a big disappointment for something claimed to have originally sold for $399. The second hand is jerky. The layout and dials are poorly designed and hard to read. Not at all how it looks in the photo. I was hoping for a great value - a poor man's Tag Huer. Not so. Not even the same league. Worth $99 not on clearance."
1,Terrible Quality,"This was my second and final Seiko timepiece. My first worked excellently for about 8 months and then the band broke. I had it repaired at a local jeweler and within a week it broke again. I had it repaired two more times with two different jewelers, but with the same results. I then purchased this watch thinking that there must have been a defect in the previous product. Four months after buying it, it broke in the exact same way my previous timepiece. I will never be buying another Seiko product and I strongly encourage investment in another brand!"
4,Good to know that Kate Pulaski is back!,A good second book for this series. Action packed and with an interesting view both of Terok Nor before it became DS9 and Kira Nerys before she became Major Kira. Also provides a peek into the workings of Quark's family circle!
3,Unoriginal.,"I enjoy seeing Dr. Pulaski, who is almost never used. However, this book is mostly a waste. It is a slightly more escalated version of the first ""Double Helix"" novel. I am not sure it was necessary at all. All the storyline plot development could have been handled in a short story or novella. Also, the time frame for the Bajorian occupation is wrong. Kira remembers things that she simply cannot, such as free Bajor (we learn in the TV series that Bajor was under occupation for 80 years), ext."
3,Way too much details of the horror of the virus,"I'm not much of a fan Katherine Pulaski, so this may be why I didn't enjoy this story nearly as much as the rest of the Double Helix mini-series. It does have some background details of Quark, Kira, Rom, Odo, Dukat, and Terok Nor. However, I didn't like very much the great ongoing details of all the people how suffered from the virus."
4,Improvement,"I'll admit that I've never been a big fan of the previous offerings into the Trek line by these two authors (Their TOS Day of Honor book being a huge expection for me). So, imagine my surprise when about half-way through I actually found myself enjoying this novel. It's a satisfying read and the authors really do capture the personalities of the characters well on the page. Giving Pulaski a bit of character development on the printed page is nice and the visits with Gul Dukat, Quark and Kira before we meet them on DS9 is nicely done. Also, the strength of this one (unlike the first novel in the series) is that the virus serves as the centerpiece of the novel without too many subplots to distract the reader.The series is showing hope....Let's just hope it continues with Carey's novel."
3,Barely readable,Pretty big drop from the first book. I just read it last week and cannot remember any good parts or any bad parts. I remember thinking how boring Kira was but that's about it.
3,"Great music, worth the price?","Three really good songs, two of which can be heard on the US Version of ""The Fire Theft."" The third song is a good song, but as with most 'B-Sides,' there is a reason it was left off the major release.My only real concern is the cost. Would you play four dollars per song, when you could spend (at the most) $13 dollars for the full album. Doing the math that's only $1 (at most) per song. Even to hear 'Hands on You' or just as a collector, I don't think it's worth it.Fantastic band... I highly recommend you spend the time and money to enjoy The Fire Theft... just maybe not on this import."
2,"Who's Stranger the Doctor, the Patient, or the Writer?","Out of all three, I don't know which one had more problems. The Doctor who brought all this stuff out, after hypnotizing the Patient, and giving her suggestions while under, the Patient, who fell for it all, the Writer who put this book together. Maybe off all three it was actually Me, for paying for the book, and reading it, even giving some creedence to it, until I saw the women on TV, and realized it was, ""Totally Unbelievable"" from begging to end. Wish I had of thought of Library first."
5,Excellent,The brush is very nice. The quality is great and does a great job. The price is not outrageous when compared to similar products online or locally.
2,Marvin Winans & Friends,"The condition of the cd was cool; however, when I got this cd I was disappointed. It wasn't the cd that I was expecting, in light of the fact that I just didn't care for the songs. I love music and can usually find something that I like, but not this time. I just wasn't happy and felt like I wasted my money!"
5,The Dot is Terrific,"This dvd, The Dot was an attempt to encourage my 4 year old son to keep picking up the crayons, and not to compare his work to his big sister, who is 5 years old. It worked like a charm, even a dot is a beautiful work of art, and the way you choose to look at it, can make it magical. He is finding his way to paper and pens more often, thanks to The Dot."
1,Spay The Cats!,"I love Cats for the fact it brought more attention back to Broadway but, sadly this musical is a musical that can be slept through. Don't get me wrong I'm certainly not a Webber hater or anything- in fact I'm a Phantom fan but, this musical is a disgrace.There really is no plot and the only 2 good songs I think are ""Memory"" and ""Rum Tum Tugger."" I made the mistake of taking a cousin to see the show throughout the whole performance she kept asking me when we could go home and the highlight of her theater expierience was buying a beanie baby during intermission. The show is long and drawn out and it's boring. The only cat I really liked was Rum Tum Tugger for the rest of the Cats seemed boring. Before you buy this C.D. also ask yourself how interesting can a show about cats be?This is one of the worst musicals ever produced and I strongly recommend if your interested in Webber to buy ""Phantom of The Opera"" and please let New York City spay the cats!"
4,I found the harmonies and lyrics to be enchanting.,"the music was phenominal, and the songs were a delight to listen too. The charectors fit the story well, and the vocal interaction was enchanting. I don't have enough good to say about this show."
5,Afficionados...or not!,"I agree with Bill: every theatre aficionado must have this CD! However, even those who aren't aficonados should seriously consider this CD. Many people think ""Cats"" is a meaningless, pointless musical; but if you really pay attention, there IS a plot and a point. (Contrary to popular belief!) It does make sense, too. The music tells of each cat--a little biography of each, if you will--and why they should be granted another 9 lives. However, if you pay very close attention and TRY to get the meaning out of it, you will. This CD evokes the true meaning of the music and the show: appearances can be deceiving, and looks aren't everything. Just because someone isn't perfect looking on the outside doesn't mean they are a bad person on the inside. I really hope you consider getting this CD; ""Cats"" isn't the longest running Broadway show because of a bunch of very slim people in skin tight outfits. It's because of the music, the magic, and the beauty of the music and story! Enjoy!"
3,Wonderful preformance but omissions and changes diminish it.,"The singing on the CD is absolutley wonderful--However one song is omitted (The aweful battle of the Pekes and Pollicles,) Growl Tiger's Last stand does NOT inclued the ""Ballad of Billy McCaw"" as the CD says, but an Italian aria spoofing Mme. Butterfly--and on top of that there are numerous spelling errors in the lyrics. Good, but could be better."
2,THIS is NY's longest running musical?,"Sorry Andrew, but what were you smoking? I listened to some of the songs, at first I thought they were kinda catchy. After a while I resorted to concussing myself to get the songs out of my head. So, long story short, avoid unless you enjoy Webber's reptitive format (beltzy soprano, love that dosen't work out, etc.) and you are the insane person who can listen to a musical hundreds of times and not get tired of them. I'm being nice by giving him 2 stars"
1,YUCK!,"We saw this video in drama class. Our teacher described it as ""a good combination of singing, dancing, acting, and art"", and that is really all that it is. Many, even most, of the kids in my class were incredibly bored by the end and would have left if it were not a class. It wasn't worth OUR time, and it's not worth your money OR time. Don't get it."
4,Nice. Where's the other CD?,I love this CD so much! Its definitely a great one. I would like to say that this company only gives Act 1 of the Show! Bummer! Maybe try a different company to buy it from. Great CD though!
3,Ooops!,"Seller made a mistake; what was sold was not what was advertised. When I contacted her, she immediately apologized, refunded my money, and told me to keep the (wrong, but nice) product. Mistakes happen; it's how you respond that matters, and her response was good."
5,Purrrrrrfection!,"This cd reaches near perfection. The vocals are great, the orchestrations are great, and the songs are very inventive. This is definately Andrew Lloyd Webbers strangest score. I have owned this cd for about five years, but i only started listening to it 2 years ago after i saw the Cats video. The strange music took me a long time to get used to, but did it ever grow on me! I love this cd and listen to it ALL the time. It is great and i am planning on buying the origonal london cast recording soon [...]. If anyone has any comments about the london cast, PLEASE e-mail me. Thanks."
4,Jon Hiseman and John Mole from Colosseum II,"Definitely, this is really enjoyable musical recording. What can I add? Just one thing, the two guys of colosseum II fame joined for drum and bass here. Especially, Jon Hiseman is one of my favorite drummer in this world!"
3,"See it first, then enjoy the memories","Without the visuals (see the live show or the WONDERFUL videotape)it would lose a lot. The best part is picturing the show in your mind as you listen. Without the images, the music is good, but. . . . it's a complete work of musical theatre which does not stand up to Webber's other works with the music alone. For Cats fans. . . go for it. For others, see it first."
2,"It was okay, but I wasn't awed by it!","I bought this CD before I saw the musical, well I still haven't seen the play live but I saw it on tape and I didn't really enjoy it and the cast recording just didn't do any thing for me I had bought it because since I loved the Phantom of the Opera I figured (Wrongly) that I would also love Cats. Cats is Ok but it just didn't thrill me as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber's wonderful The Phanom of The Opera did or as much as the non webber musicals Les Miserables and Miss Saigon did and since I didn't enjoy the Cats cast recording I recently gave it away to a relative who loved Cats and will get better use of the CD's. I'm not saying that people shouldn't go see Cats or listen to the cast recording and that they shouldn't like it I'm just saying that I personally didn't care for it."

3,You get what you pay for,"These are cheap shocks, but they do their job. Don't know how long they will last. But the price is great."
3,Student's Times Newspaper,The student enjoyed filling out the newspaper. The only critical comment is on the size of poster. It is somewhat too big for a classroom that does not have too many walls for display.
3,Book is ok,"The books are ok, but they are not what I wanted. It seems that my kid don't really like them."
1,Quite Useless,"This is not the way to teach history. You need to use original sources, or at least books that cover subject area in a scholarly way."
5,A MUST READ FOR THE LAB OWNER!,"Wolters is (in my opinion) one of, if not the, best and most knowlegdeable author(s)for the training of dogs, especially the Lab.I have all of his dog books. Family Dog has been especially importantbecause it gives the general information on puppy selection and phasesas well as training philosopy without pictures of birdsin the dogs mouths or any information about using the dog for hunting.Which is great if you don't plan to hunt your dog, but also indespensible reading foryour partner in training and raising a puppy in my case it is the perfect companionto Water Dog (also by Wolters).My wife has read Family Dog and now understands the importance of many things in the training of our new puppy which she wouldn't have if only given the choice to read Water Dog.Family Dog is written well enough for a child to read as a primer for your new puppy (in fact Wolters Daughter is included as the primary trainer)."
3,I'm sure it would be awesome for a puppy.,"This book seems like it would be perfect for a new puppy, but it didn't help much for a 1.5 year old adopted dog. It did give some good training tips, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you haven't gotten a dog yet and are just starting to research them."
5,The Perfect companion to Water Dog.,"If your a Lab owner and want an ideal way to train your family dog, you have found the ideal book in family Dog.It also is a great companion to Water Dog. Simply a must read for lab owners!!"
4,Common Sense Approach,"This is a common sense approach to training a puppy. The specific times for training were interesting, however not useful since my puppy was already older than the specified ages. I liked that the training wasn't all sunshine and roses, every once in a while a swat is necessary.This book made sense, almost too much sense. I didn't finish it because by the end I had a good idea of what to do if I wanted to train my puppy to do those tricks."
2,What I ordered... but not what I expected.,"Service was great and book was in excellent condition. The book is an older print and too simplified for training a puppy. I was recommended this book by a friend... but, it was not the greatest training book. My fault for not doing enough research. Some discipline was too 'heavy handed' for me... It included numerous pics that may have not been needed. The book is about including your children in the training. We are empty nesters... so did not need that info."
1,Read through this but didn't buy it,"The author advocates hitting your dog as a routine part of training. A better book is ""No Bad Dogs: The Woodhouse Way"""
1,No Need to hit your dog,"This trainer uses negative reinforcement as a cornerstone to training. Like children, pets should never be hit to acheive a desired result. This method is abusive and the action of a lazy, inpatient trainer and usually accompanies the trainer's loss of temper. The author's approach is to whip the puppy into shape in 16 weeks. Again like children, dogs need ongoing and consistant education and positive reinforcement. Bad Trainer, Bad Book! A much better book is ""The Art of Raising a Puppy"" or ""Mother Knows Best""."
1,I think this book is dangerous to dogs!,"I was very disappointed to have paid ANYTHING for this book, which reccomends harsh ways to train a dog. I began to be suspicious when the author wrote that you MUST take the dog home at 7 weeks (earlier than any vet or breeder advice). I knew I was reading the wrong book when he suggested knocking a dog down a flight of stairs to teach him not to go down ahead of you; to close a door or gate on his neck to teach him not to run out; and to smack him across the nose or spank him to ""teach the dog that you mean business."" (p. 74). Maybe this is how some people treat working dogs, but our pup is a beloved member of our family. We have never had to use violence to teach any of our dogs these things, and I shudder to think of the consequences of having children witness such punishment. If you have ANY problem with violence or corporal punishment, skip this book!"
4,Awesome,Awesome condition and it got her in less time than estimated. Good service. It certainly helps in training the new friend I have too!
2,Not worth the money,This book was very disappointing. The photographs were no where near the quality found in the Victoria magazines.
4,"1/4"" Socket Set","This set does not have every bit you might ever need, but for a small set it is perfect. It's durable, and comes in a good molded case. I actually wanted it because we are doing a bunch of work with ""star"" bits (which you have to buy separately, but are available and cheap) which fit right into the socket heads. This solution avoids our having to lug around our full ratchet set, which is bulky and heavy. For light work of all kinds on relatively small bolts, (or for a secondary set like mine) this set is perfect, and is a good value."

1,it is'nt really good,"well i bought this book at a bookstore and i found some secrets that are in the official but not in this one i got frustrated missing those secrets and i highly recomend ""NOT"" buying this book i would stick with official ok so dont get this"
2,LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE BOOKSHELF!,this book has some good information but it is truly lacking in style. there are no pictures which takes away the interest and the information for each area is hard to follow. I don't recomend this book
1,This Book Dont Bye Plz Dont Bye,This book lacked everthing Chocobos Wepons you name it it lacked it stan
5,Who cares if you don't have the game; buy the book anyway!!,"I'm 10 years old, so I have a different oppinion. To all the kids out there, who cares if you don't have the game!! This book helped me a lot!! Thanks who ever wrote that book!!"
2,Tiny Jars,"I was unpleasantly surprised to find that there was only enough in the tiny jars for about 2 foot baths! The products did make my feet feel very nice and soft, however the small package for the $16.00 price really disappointed me."
5,Klute should have been on the AFI list,"Klute is one of my favorite films of all time.It ranks right up there with ""The Parallax View"" as Allan Pakula's best film.Donald Sutherland gives a superb performance as the low-key sensitive cop, Klute, and Jane Fonda is wonderful (as always).The film is brilliant in so many ways. It is very visually striking, perfectly acted, great musical score, I cannot say enough about this movie. It is a quintessential American film that along with so many others from the 70's: Deliverance, The Parallax View, The Conversation, Night Moves, and from the late 60's, Point Blank, was unjustly left of AFI's top 100 movies list."
4,Fonda's awesome but I did doze off,"Klute was a real treat for me to watch. Fonda was dynamite. Hollywood acting now seems to hide behind fast camera-work and scene breaks; Fonda did not. During some parts, I felt uncomfortable watching because Fonda put on such a fantastic performance as Bree Daniels, a prostitute. The long, unbroken camera shots create an intimacy between you as the observer and Fonda as the performer. Yet, staying true to her character, you never get close to truly understanding Bree Daniels. Donald Sutherland also puts on a stoic performance as Klute, the quiet protective detective (hey, that rhymes). The bulk of my movie experience deals with blockbusters and quirky romantic comedies, so the unbroken long camera shots and smart psychological (? I'm at a lost for good, descriptive words) script were a real treat. I did doze off though. Four solid stars."
5,"Atmospheric , creepy , film noir like with great acting","Like a lot of the old film noirs , the title character John could be getting played for a fool . Is he or not ?There's a good reason for him being named John , when you look at it another way .The impact of this film comes from the fact that the two main characters have been closing themselves off , whilst both being very good at what they do .Everyone in the film is getting manipulated in one way or another . There is a sense of menace , but also sadness and loneliness that one finds with a number of 70's films .They often have memorable endings , as does this .This is one of my favorite films as I used to know a girl who had the same problem that Jane Fonda's character does , personality wise I mean , not occupation wise .KLUTE works as a thriller and/or as a character study .Watch and enjoy the acting and fine directing .I hope it becomes one of your favourite films also ."
5,Exactly what I expected,"Having seen the movie many years ago, this was exactly what I anticipated it would be. Early Jane Fonda flick, still developing her talents."
3,ACTRESS PAYING HER BILLS,"This film was made in 1971 and shows its age. The photography was interesting and used a lot of shadows, adding to the suspense. Fonda won an Oscar for her role, and the murder/mystery/thriller film was loaded with good character actors. The plot has been discussed except there wasn't much praise of Sutherlnd playing the small-town, poker-faced cop - he was excellent. Every prostitute must come across 'bad eggs' and Fonda/Bree certainly did. Many of the ladies are wanna-be actresses and many never make the bigtime, and have to resort back to entertaining the johns to pay their bills. This film will not go down as one of my ""gotta see again"" flicks."
3,Jane Fonda's Oscar-Winning Performance,"Released in 1971, ""Klute"" has not aged particularly well. However, the same cannot be said about Jane Fonda's multidimensional portrayal of a New York prostitute. Thanks to her versatility, the film is more effective as a character study than a suspense-thriller. Director Alan J. Pakula struggles with pacing and excessive length, yet benefits immeasurably from the striking cinematography of Gordon Willis. In the title role, Donald Sutherland gives an admirably understated performance while displaying strong chemistry with Fonda. Equally powerful are the creepy turns by Charles Cioffi and Roy Scheider. Nevertheless, it is Fonda's astonishing work that holds ""Klute"" together."
3,Good performances in a mediocre film,"The Bottom Line:Donald Sutherland does a good job underplaying his role and every moment Jane Fonda is onscreen is fascinating, but the thriller aspects of Pakula's Klute never manage to interest, let alone raise the pulse, and so I have difficulty recommending it despite the leads; if you're a big fan of Fonda or Pakula check it out, but otherwise seek out a less moribund thriller.2.5/4"
3,Just as pictured...,"this bracelet does not have the shiny appearance of rhodium plating, but rather a matte finish to it. It's lightweight and fits fine on my wrist. For the price I paid, (70% off) it was worth it, but I wouldnt have purchased it for any more than that.Nothing special about this bracelet; just a simple piece, a simple design, for a great price."
5,I love this thing!,At first I hated Sailor Moon but I've grown to be obssesed with it! Mercury's my personal favorite so I HAD to buy this video.
5,Mars and Mercury make a threesome! :),"These episodes are special, because you get to see how two new scouts join the team, Amy Anderson/Mizuno Ami and Raye Hino/Hino Rei. To understand their backgrounds, these episodes are a must!"
3,htto://www.bruna.com.br,"I believe that this movie could have been much better ... your production is perfectly correct ...but it don't get convince me...some people who know me wouldn't understand me , because I like sailor moon so much ...SO, I 'm being honest ...the plot could be more interesting and convincing !!!-"
1,What the heck is wrong with you people?,"dont you have any comments on anything wrong with it? Not all of the reviews say its great, but why do you all make it seem great? Well, i guess you all havent seen the REAL bishoujo senshi sera muño. Even the first series isnt all that good. I guess you all havent seen much of sailor moon. See VKLL fansub. Then you'll change your minds. I would only recommend this to little kids. The sub is for older viewers."
3,"Good recipes, but no visuals !!","This book has very easy to do recipes but seems like it was done using a typewriter some 20 years ago. There are no pictures of any kind to illustrate anything, so you're on your own guessing how things would look like and for a recipe book, they should have print it on better paper, because of it's newspaper quality, any spill on it and it ruins a lot of pages."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,What a joke. These Le Creuset Stoneware Petite Casseroles have no purpose. They are 100% smaller than I thought. They are usuless and waaaayyyy overpriced. They aren't worth 5 bucks a piece let alone the $14.99 a piece I paid and I bought 8 of them. save your money! don't buy these!
5,MASTERPIECE,"I'M A HUGE CHAKA KHAN FAN. IN MY OPINION, THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER ALBUMS THAT SHE RECORDED WITH RUFUS. WITH THIS ALBUM, SHE PROVES THAT SHE CAN BE JUST AS GREAT A SINGER WITHOUT EVEN WAILING. HER VOICE IS ONE OF CLASS. I MEAN, THE WAY SHE USES HER INSTRUMENT IS TRULY AMAZING TO ME. MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM IS ""HOLLYWOOD."" SHE STARTS WITH A SMOOTH JAZZY PHRASING IN THE BEGINNING AND GETS INTO HER SIGNATURE HORN BY THE END OF THE SONG, WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT SHE DOES FOR MOST OF THE ALBUM. AS FAR AS INSTRUMENTATION, THE BAND IS JUST AS UP TO PAR AS CHAKA ON THIS SET. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL CHAKA FANS."
4,Nice set featuring a great singer,"""Earth Song,"" ""Hollywood,"" and ""Everlasting Love"" are worth the rating by themselves. Chaka Khan was one of my first musical favorites because my parents played this album over and over again."
5,Awesome project for any Chaka Fan,"By time this album came out in '77, Chaka Khan was preparing her solo career, and this collection showcases her often imitated vocal style, which is rich in range & texture.She sings a variety of tunes here, and you will not be dissappointed with this.Also buy 'Rufusized', 'Rufus', and 'Rags to Rufus' for more natural soulfulness by Chaka Khan."
5,this is a classic,"songs are not written like this anymore. we all should be thankfull that our old snap, crackle and pop albums are being released as cd's now.lm"
2,CD Quality,"The cd came in a timely manner. The quality of the cd was not good at all. I dont think it was the fault of amazon. I think it was the recording itself. Now I understand why some cd's are remastered. I love the song ""Everlasting Love"" I only bought the cd for that song. Now I'll have to purchase it again"
5,Love it,My 3 year old absolutely loves this book. We read it sometimes 3 times a night. He likes me to read the text and then he reads the items that were bought.
2,disappointed in picture quality,"I have borrowed this book numerous times from our local library and I just love the beautiful, vibrant illistrations. However, in this edition the color and vibrancy of the pictures is just not there. Since this is a picture book I am very disappointed."
5,One of the Best Alphabet Books.,"Most alphabet books serve the purpose they were made for, to help children learn the ABC's, but are full of mediocrity. Some are just plain awful. However, ever now and again an alphabet book is discovered that is pure genius. ON MARKET STREET is such a book. Not only is the book a delight to read and look at, but it includes a slight lesson in giving as well. A young girl goes to market street and buys items that start with each letter of the alphabet. The vendors that sell these items are illustrated in the wares they sell. So the apple man is made of apples and the book lady is made of books, etc. The illustrations are full of imagination and help children associate letters with certain pictures. A delightful book that kids love having read to them."
5,Amazing illustrations,"This is a book that you love because of the amazing pictures. There is only one word per page, such as lollipop on the ""L"" page but the illustrations lead to great conversations and let the imagination open up. My son was picking from the people he loves and matching them to people in the book. It is a good book for young children."
5,Incredibly good noir,"Gorgeously written story about protecting those we love from the darkness that these characters are so attracted to. Their are no saints here. Basically a mystery story only everyone seems to have their own mysterious secret as well, and the heroine must face her own secrets and dark nature. This author ous adept at dealing with female friendships and fakeships, and the natural need we feel to protect our secrets while remaining intensely obsessed with other's secrets. Currently reading all her works."
5,A thinking person's noir,"I loved Megan's Abbott's book! It's an achievement. She handles the form as a master. The writing is elegant -- I especially like the rhythms of the catalogs, the litanies; the vivid present tense. And, I like the subtlety with which she weaves her ideas -- the fusion of noir and fifties-suburban-ideal; the feminist take on both genres -- into a fast-paced and entertaining novel. It is cinematic. A great debut."
5,NORTHEAST WAKE UP CALL,"People in the Northeast have this idea that hurricanes are southern storms. This PBS special on the Hurricane of 1938 makes it most clear that the entire north east coast of the U.S. is most vulnerable .After New Orleans and Miami ,New York City is the third most vulnerable city to hurricanes.What makes this particular story so tragic is that there was no warning. Weather forcasters believed the hurricane would go safely out to sea.I t wasn't until a thirty foot wall of water smashed into Long island that the catastrophy began to unfold. Well done including interviews with survivors,"
5,Essential!,I'm a nanny with over 5 years of experience with multiples. You wrote the book I've always wanted to! Way to go! I plan on getting one for my employers when I leave this job and will also be purchasing one to keep for myself at home.
5,the most wonderful book,"This book was one of the most thrilling stories I heard a long time ago, but the more I read it and study the subject I realized how important is for our spiritual and future life, and even nowdays development...this author is guiding us through a marvelous and valuable knowledge...it is highly recommended for those who wonders about the world and its real future and for those depresing signs of destruction when the book tells us about construction and optimism..."
3,"Interesting, to say the least.","Mr. Argulles gives a concise and easy-to-understand analysis of the Mayan Calendar, and then proceeds to leap into unique and interestingly odd interpretations of this calendar and what it means for humanity (based on his interpretation). Although I question his New Age terminology, the ideas as presented are certainly worth having a look at if you're interested in this subject and have a tolerance for the mathematical complexity that this calendar can present. Argulles has apparently amassed quite a little following by charging people for ""further information,"" but this book really is all one needs to understand his bizarre interpretations of Mayan spirituality. Nonetheless, it is a strangely good read."
1,An Alternative to Argulles,"This is for reviewer CHRISTOPHER FUNG. If you found Argulles' work to be a load of mallarky, you might find an alternate study of the Mayan Calendar interesting. Swedish Mayanist/authro Carl Johan Calleman has written a book on the subject and he is in strong disagreement with Argulles' conjectures (and this whole Dreamspell business). He even sets a completely different date for the end of the Mayan Calendar (a year earlier). Hope you find this info useful."
5,in small doses,I've done many mind-altering drugs in my life. I will say that this book was more powerful than all of those. I had to put it down about halfway through to take a break and I haven't picked it back up yet. Extremely interesting although parts of it get too dry and mathematical / very confusing / patterns which I fail to understand.... but those other parts.. oh my god! mind blowing!
1,"Great text, but the copy is poor","Unfortunately, unless you can get ahold of an older, unmarked copy, you may be disappointed by the ""new"" book sold through Amazon. Spectra are cut off, along with the legends. The pages look like they were photocopied, poorly, in some cases and the text on several pages is blackened by photocopied handwriting within the book. Strange, as Dover is typically very conscientious. I found another older copy and must say, I really do enjoy this book. It reads well and Herzberg describes many aspects of atomic spectroscopy and how structure is related quite brilliantly. I can highly recommend the book, but not this particular printing."
4,Sheer Entertainment,This book does not stoop to being a mere love story. The characters are as engaging but come second to the lush descriptions of the landscape. This book makes you hunger for hot climates and a good bottle of wine.
3,Nicely descriptive but lacking a bit in story.,"I enjoyed many parts of Hotel Pastis - mainly the beautiful descriptions of Provence, and the lovely idea of restoring an old building and creating a hotel. The characters are all fairly well defined and occasionally offer some funny dialogue, and it's a setting one would enjoy being in.Other than that, I felt the story was a bit weak. The subplot of the band of...cyclists, we'll call them, is built up throughout the book and then pretty weakly disposed of, with no resolution to something the author spent a great deal of effort setting up. The final act of the story centers too much on something that happens to a character we barely know and don't really care about, and pushes the characters we do know and are interested in into the background. It seemed an odd story telling choice to me.But otherwise, it's a good casual read and will make you want to lounge poolside in Provence."
5,Tim Pigott-Smith's reading brings this audio book alive!,"This audio-book is one not to be missed! Peter Mayle captured the charm and seduction of a vacation in provence, but Tim Pigott-Smith's reading is the breath of life. Each character is instantly recognizable -- and there are many. Watch out: You are likely to find yourself plotting with the bad guys, cheering for the good, and all the while feeling as if you KNOW them personally... It was a wonderful vacation!"
4,"Great send-up of the advertising business, and romance in France...","I've read this in English and French and enjoyed it both times. It's a romp, nothing serious, but it is a romp with a great key for life among the French of course. But if it is also a send-up of the advertising industry, where Peter Mayle worked before he was lucky enough to move to France as a writer. Chapter 5 is a perfect satire of pitching a new client -- in this case, the condom industry account. In other words, just too much fun in all directions."
4,VACATION READ,"Not the world's greatest novel, but fun to read and enjoy the characters, and of course, pick up a little French along the way. I enjoy the old basic concept of getting away from a hectic life (protagonist Simon Shaw) and moving on to a 'more supposedly relaxing one.' I do appreciate Provence and the book was a reminder of some of my earlier, pleasant travels. Light, entertaining reading - good escape literature. I believe I'll go have a pastry and some dark black coffee!"
3,An enjoyable read,"An enjoyable read!The author grabs your attention and even gives you a few lol. It is not as good as ""A Year in Provence""A Year in Provence.So if you haven't read it, get ""A Year"" instead. My father bought a farm, moved there from the New York suburbs and started to make it go. So I've read almost all the ""moving out to the country to enjoy the simple life"" books. A Year in Provence is by far and away the best (and funniest) of the genre.But Hotel Pastis is still a good beach book."
4,"Metroland is humorous, insightful, and refreshing.","I agree with KidTiger's review that the museum scene is priceless;many others are too.I don't think the book depicts a stereotypical account of English boys' adolesent thoughts, but I would love to believe they are all so pensive and aware--even in the sometimes sophmoric ways of Toni and Chris. The way these observations and thoughts are conveyed are refreshingly honest and admittedly naive. I have recommended this fast-read gem to all English guys I know who want to revisit an awkward time and laugh."
4,Metroland,"Julian Barnes is my preferred author for the present time. I read the great majority of his books. They contain a lot of life philosophy. I felt richer spiritually after reading each of his books. The most beautiful page I read about fiction was the preface of his latest book ""Through the window"". I read it for all my friends"
3,Barnes lite,A good book of course but of the 4 or so I have read it has the least substance.Definitely no Sense of an Ending.
4,Intelligent,"As always, books mean different things to different people.For me, this book is about how we change as we grow older. Or rather, not the fact that we change, but the way that we move in different directions.Its about the wedge that time drives between us, and it reflects the experience of every one of us.In places it is a little painful - it offers no rose-tinted view of life, merely tells it how it is.For those who prefer to escape into their reading list, it is probably not ideal. But it is extremely well written (as always! Barnes is a very accomplished author), and flows nicely.All in all, an intelligent, and very observant book."
5,Beautiful Transfer,"Blu Ray review: 1080p Tarantino approved transfer, DTS sound, and all the extras from the collector's edition plus a couple of new featurettes including a panel of experts in a 20 minute discussion make this obviously the best version out there. I wish Quentin would do commentary tracks, or some sort of fan or scholar commentary existed on these collections like the Criterion Collection. Also a bummer to buy it for 12.99 and then see it on Black Friday for 3.99 but hey, I guess prices and deals constantly fluctuate - and for a classic with this many extras, any price is probably well worth it."
3,Cult Classic,It never made it big at the movie mostly because it just isn't that great of a story but for teen boys its got all they want
5,great Movie.,"Great adventure and action movie, would not suggest for children. I have bought several as gifts. Buy this movie for a gift."
3,A little slow but it has two things working for it.,"Although a little to long I liked Jackie Brown. And it had two things working for it, Sam Jacksons saying ""Hey, is that Rutger Hauer?"" and of course the fact that Chris Tucker gets shot and killed."
4,Movie's Real Star is the Music!,"Quentin Tarantino pays homage to the blackploitation era of the 70's in this film based on Elmore Leonard's novel, ""Rum Punch"". Unlike the book, the film's lead character is black, not white. That change actually enhances the movie, making it more authentic. Pam Grier gives a Oscar worthy performance as the flight attendant hooked into a dangerous plot. Robert Forester gives one of his best performances of his career as bail bondsman, Max Cherry. Couple that with an all-star cast featuring Robert DeNiro, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Samuel L. Jackson. But what makes this film shine is the music. Fans of late 70's soul music will be asking for the soundtrack. Though a notch below Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" still delivers the goods! Very Good Film!"
4,Quentin and co. at their best,"It upsets me that so many critics tend to belittle this excellent film. Being a fan of Quentin's work, I find this to be his finest moment. He strays from his hackneyed, recycled ideas of the past and delivers a movie intriguing to follow with actors who make the characters belivable. On top of superb acting, by both big names and cult icons, the character development makes what could be a boring and semi-predictable plot into a layered, emotional, and innovative look at how different people handle different situations (of course, in a more exaggerated state).I've been looking forward to this movie being released on DVD for years now, and on top of seeing the movie in a new light; the extras are also worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor; pony up and buy the pic...you won't regret it."
5,Insert Title Here,"Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most well-rounded movie;it flows much more smoothly than Pulp Fiction, and it doesn't seem over too soon like Reservoir Dogs. The cast is delightful and the plot is somewhat believable. I haven't finished the book yet, but every part (save for the beginning) parallels the movie, which is very lengthy, but seems over in just the right amount of time. I don't feel like writing much more, so that's about it."
2,Snail's pace melodrama,"I expected much more from Tarintino. I expected the energetic, zany, ultraviolent rollercoster I saw in all his previous projects- ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""True Romance,"" ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" But his latest film, ""Jackie Brown"" left me wanting more. I think Tarintino purposley tried to screw his die-hard fans with this movie. It's the opposite of his other films. It's a logically told, slow moving, even DULL mix of mystery, satire, action, and campy comedy. It's complexity actually hurts it. The running time is much to long and it never really gets intresting. The cast is really good, but other than that you get nothing you've come to expect out of a Quinton Tarintino film."
2,Good actors involved but still lacks punch.,"Jackie Brown a Quentin Tarantino film is one of those films that brings an assorment of good acting talent laced with rare but good 70 music and feroicus dialouge, the problem is they did not blend well together thus making the storyline long, boring and played out long before the credits roll. Based On famed crime author Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" Pam Grier of the 70's black explotation craze is an flight attendent who gets mixed up with a gunrunner, FBI and a bail bondsman over a stash of millon dollars which is brought in illegaly into the U.S Apart from the music and great actors the film is weak and often times fails misrably to sustain the audeience's attention to views these moraly corrutpetd indidvduals for nearly 2 hours. Now i see why it did poorly at the box office. But I must admit Pam Grier Is still one hot looking woman after all these years but her sexy persona and charm isn't enough to save this film."
2,THE WELL WENT DRY...,"THis is the last movie I watched by Tarantino. It seems to me that his formula of cloning old scenes and ideas from older movies, comic books and TV shows are beginning to seem repetitive. He's a very limited director, who had a brief stardom then went back to the place he belongs. THis movie is boring, although no doubt the actors are great. I'm only sorry for De Niro being in his ridiculous small part as a little bad guy."
3,Jackie Brown,"The movie spent way too much time on the small things the characters were doing, which actually is pretty normal for a Tarantino movie, but it just wasn't as interesting in this movie. I found myself mostly bored. The story is good, and the acting is good. I thought DeNiro was the highlight of the film. Overall though, it was just not nearly as good as Tarantino's other works, and also just not a very good movie."
2,Quality,Product was not 100% in good condition. There were a few fuzzy scenes in the movie. Also there is nonremovable scuff/scratch mark in the inner circle of DVD on the back.
3,Pretty good,I saw this in the theater years ago. It was pretty good. I tried to give it 3 1/2 stars but apparently you can't. You wouldn't regret watching it.
4,Full of great acting and good writing,"Three years after his instant classic ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Tarantino came back with ""Jackie Brown"" which was not nearly as well received by audiences and critics than the ealier film. Though JB is not quite on par with PF, it is a good film worth of respect.One of the major assets of this picture is the outstanding cast. Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro and Samuel L. Jackson deliver fine performances and Robert Forster is the standout of the fantastic supporting cast. Tarantino's script does not disappoint too. His dialogue is even better than Elmore Leonard's original. As in his previous pics, Tarantino effectively uses source music throughout the film. If there's any downside than it is the running time. 155 minutes are too many for a film like this.""Jackie Brown"" confirms that Tarantino is one of the most talented american directors and a filmmaker whose next film will be an event worth looking forward to."
3,Just okay,I am a big fan of Quentin Tarrintinos films but this one is probably my least favorite out of all his films. The acting is pretty good and it has a great cast but the movie has a very slow plot. The second half is awsome but the beginning of the film takes to long to get to the main plot so that make take your intrest out of the film right away. This movie is no way near the greatness of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp fiction but it is still a pretty decent movie. Samuel Jackson is a great actor and continues to show why he is the badest you know what on the planet. The film has a great soundtrack that really sets a tone for what type of movie it is.You can recognize some odd angles that tarrintino has used in all his movies and he still has put some funny dialogue in his film. I just think that you may be a little dissapointed with this film. But its still worth a wacth.
2,Jackie Brownzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Quite a bit too leisurely a pace. Terrific cast (for the most part), but a deeply flawed film. Forster is great, Jackson is great, De Niro is De Niro, Fonda is less horrible than usual but Pam Grier is a cipher. Touted as her 'comeback' the simple fact remains that the reason we see so little of her on the screen is that she really isn't a very interesting actress. But to be fair she sure can light a cigarette. And how about that Tarantino? What about the middle class white boy video clerk fixation on superfly black gangster stereotypes? Anyone but me a little offended?"
5,A Fine Elmore Leonard Adapation,"It has been many years since I saw this 1997 film and I had forgotten how good it was. Some of my favorite actors (Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and the lead Pam Grier) are in the film and Robert Forster won an Oscar nomination for his role as bailbondsman Max Cherry. Leonard's lead in the novel Rum Punch was a white woman: he agreed that Tarantino's selection of Pam Grier, a fixture in many blaxploitation films, was the right person to play opposite Jackson. Coming between Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill (2003-4), this film has not gotten the attention it deserves."
3,"Great, if you wanna check out Pam Grier!","Man she is finer than fine in almost every scene she's in! 'Foxy' Brown indeed!Unfortunately, that's the big reason you would have to check the film out. I wasn't expecting Pulp Fiction/Resoirvoir Dogs style intensity, but Jackie Brown doesn't even compare favorably with 'Get Shorty'. The main problem - TOO TALKY! And all the talk is largely about nothing, as opposed to the richness of the scripts of PF/RD. The core of the film, that being who's conning who? goes limp pretty quickly. The actors are all fine, especially Samuel L. Jackson. I swear, he should do a standup comic routine or a one-man theater show, and used the M-Word liberally throughout, because no one does it as fluently as he does. The ending meanwhile, will suprise no one. A good 30 minutes could have been sliced off of this film and made it a tighter, more cohesive experience. The extras are all OK, but like I said at the beginning, you'll want this film for Pam Grier and little else."
4,Another exceptional movie from QT,"Tarantino has the near impossible task of trying to top himself from Pulp Fiction. With Jackie Brown, he has proven how talented he is by taking someone elses material-Elmore Leonard & putting his trademark on it with snappy dialogue. Another stellar performance by Samuel Jackson, & it would have been nice to have had QT do a small cameo. Technically, he's in the movie, he's the voice message on Pam Grier's answering machine!"
5,Jackie Brown,"This pitch-perfect adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" delivers the goods--and then some. With its cheeky dialogue, blasts of violence, and an eccentric gallery of characters, ""Jackie Brown"" exemplifies the kind of robust, genuinely thrilling material a Tarantino-Leonard match-up can produce. Grier and Jackson make excellent, illicit adversaries, and the supporting cast, including De Niro as Ordell's pothead partner and Fonda as a sun-kissed stoner babe, couldn't be better. The other triumph of ""Jackie Brown"" belongs to Forster, a forgotten actor (like Grier) whose turn as Jackie's regular-guy love interest earned him an Oscar nod."
1,Terrible,"I gave Tarantino a chance and he blew it big time. The movie was boring, pointless, and an insult to Elmore Leonard. I love Robert De Niro as an actor, but not even him (or Bridget Fonda looking better than ever) could save this film."
2,2 and a 1/2 Quentin Tarantino's worst effort,This movie did not feel like Tarantino esque quality. I was real dissapointed with it and thought it could've been much much better than it was.
2,BORING,This movie is horrible. Bottom line there was no violence in it!!!! This movie sucked out loud!!!! Quentin you disappoint me.Whoever is reading this review see pulp fiction that movie rockedhowever this movie is a joke!!!!
1,"wow, a movie just as boring as death proof !","the artsyfartsy's just love non existant action (i can here the q-berts yell ''lip flipping IS action !'' now) movies with unending amounts of jive talk. movies like this you dont even have to look at. close your eyes and listen. its like an audio book. i wonder if blabentino thought to himself ''wow, nothing is happening....hhhhmmmmm. i know, ADD MORE DIALOGUE !''wd qt, wd !"
1,What the ??!?!?!,TERRIBLE!!! I can't believe Tarantino is capable of such garbage. Nothing happens!!! It's like 2.5 hrs long and nothing happens. Is that even possible? Brutally boring. How does anyone rate this movie highly? Maybe it's a movie where you have to be a book nerd who liked the transation to film? All I know is NOTHING HAPPENS! Q: What is the plot? A. Who knows. If someone asks me what this movie was about - I say 'It's about NOTHING'. And not in a good Seinfeld way. Sad really. I think Tarantino tried to make a cool movie. But along the way he forgot that a movie needs to tell a story. This movie is like watching a slideshow - and who the hell needs that?
3,Great movie,"A lot of extras, and good quality of image and sound, but that case is awful and I changed it."
3,Tarrantino's Ode to Blackxploitation Films.,"I would give this movie 3.5 stars if possible.First off, I thought the ingredients for this movie were very good. The casting was superb. Casting Pam Grier was obvious but genius too; Deniro, Keaton, Forrestor, and Fonda, just perfect. The scripting was really good, the plot was well done. The music was dead on perfect. But it didn't come together as good as it should have. Why was that?I can tell you easy. It was done too dead-pan, too serious. It felt at times dull, at times forced. Look at Tarrantino's better recieved films...Resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol I, & II. Those films never took themselves too seriously, not even Resevior Dogs. That is my only problem with this movie, something that should have been corrected in the editing. This was a movie that didn't equal the sum of its parts.Otherwise, it is a movie definately worth seeing, a high quality movie. It really is well done, just a bit dry."
4,A great movie.,"I think the main reason many critics and audiences spoke so low of this movie when it first came out was because so many people were expecting a ""Pulp Fiction, part II."" I still like Pulp better, but Jackie Brown is still a very good movie. The performances are top notch, and the story line is steady and gripping. I will admit to finding it a bit long, but in end it all seemed to work out for the best. The abrupt ending was quick and eqasy and very likeable. The characters seemed real and very down to earth, even the ones we grew to hat. As always, Sam Jackson gives a fine performances, Pam Greer is irresistable, and even Bridget Fonda, who I normally hate, was fun to watch. I thought Robert Forster was great and extremely belivalbe as a simple bail bondsman who falls for Greer's Jackie. I was surprised to see Bobby DeNiro with such a small part, with such little dialogue, but he worked it well. This is a very good movie that I highly recomend, with a warning to be patient."
4,underrated,"I liked this movie much more after seeing it a few times and being able to absorb the visual techinque and dialogue. Tarantino is a great movie scribe and everyone seems to want to copy him since Pulp Fiction, so far no one has come close. The movie is too long but worth the wait as the end pay off is terrific. Grier, Jackson and all included give great performances. Critics have blasted De Niro's performance as being to oafish and uninvolving yet I saw him as the most humorous part of the film. Tarantino will, however need to develop his skills at directing films outside of the crime genre and if he does, he may be regarded as one of the greats."
3,solid flick,very good movie..great acting and captures the genre well.foxy brown has it going on and samuel l is the man..not as good as pulp fiction but stilll worth a buy
5,INCREDIBLE!!!,"This movie will show one the true genius of Quentin T. What makes this movie so great besides a great cast is the dialogue that takes place between its characters. Samuel Jackson is incredibly believable in the part of Ordell, a small-time gun-runner. Robert De Niro plays a complete idiot (Ordell's sidekick). If you don't enjoy this movie, maybe you should go rent Snow White!"
4,"The music grabs your attention, casting and acting is superb","This movie will entertain you from start to finish,the music is genius, and the casting was calculated, in the Tarantino style. Watching Deniro, in a supporting role takes some getting use to, he pulls it off with class and artistry. The ending is not predictable and does not dissapoint. Samuel Jackson deserved an award for his acting, but then he usually does. If I would have paid to see this on the big screen I would have walked out feeling like I got my moneys worth, that is very rare."
2,Movies that make you go 'hmmmm',"I read with great interest the 4 and 5 stars reviews. I liked Tarantino's first 2 movies but would have been terribly disappointed if he had made something close. So I give some kudos to him for trying something new. What is similar is his desire to tell a story through dialogue and circumstances. What I didn't feel were the accolades others have bestowed - interesting story, strong characters, etc. I feel like I should go back and watch this again just to make sure I'm not losing my mind. Quite honestly I was bored. None of the characters seemed interesting and I had no emotional attachment to any of them. The story seemed to plod. The 2 stars are really for the acting which is well done. But you can't act yourself out of bad writing and direction. Maybe I'll go back and rent this. Surely I'm missing something?"
5,Across 110th st.,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting by Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro, and especially Samuel Jackson was supurb. I can't wait for this movie to come out on Dvd."
3,I don't know...,"If this weren't a Quentin Tarantino film, I probably would have given it four stars. However, given what he is capable of, I couldn't help but be disappointed with this one. Maybe it's because it's not an original screenplay. I found the whole thing rather long, drawn out and tedious. (BTW, Reservoir Dogs is my favorite film of all time, so this isn't an anti-QT posting.) I just didn't care for this one."
2,Not what I expected,"After watching movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'From Dusk Til Dawn' and knowing Quentins way of directing I was dissapointed in 'Jackie Brown'. It has some good scenes, but I missed the well-known sarcasm and irony in it. It's not one of his best!!"
4,Good Stuff Worthy to Be Reissued,"Perla Batalla was featured as a backup singer on Leonard Cohen's live CD (a must-have for Lenny fans), but here she steps to the forefront on her self-titled debut recording. Coming from a background steeped in the music of Mexico, Perla Batalla has a rich voice that sounds something like Linda Ronstadt, but with plenty of individuality and expressive power. Ms. Batalla contributes some original songs, and also does nice covers of Van Morrison's ""Crazy Love"" and especially of Leonard Cohen's ""Seems So Long Ago, Nancy"" (which she does so well that I would love to hear her do a CD of Cohen tunes--her one Cohen song gave me much more pleasure than the whole of Jennifer Warnes's Famous Blue Raincoat CD). The musical arrangements are inventive, the recording quality is very good, and the end result is a debut recording that is clearly the work of a seasoned musical pro."
4,A Must-Have for Perla Fans,"To me, Perla is way beyond most every popular female vocalist I've heard, surpassed only by Karen Carpenter. More than any other of her CD's, this one showcases her gorgeous voice. My favorite Perla song by far, is on this disc: Make It Simple. Here you really get to experience the amazing range and beauty of her voice. I find Perla's rendition of Seems So Long Ago/Nancy on this CD much better than the one on her Songs of Leonard Cohen CD. It's less instruments and more Perla. Cucurrucucu Paloma is another masterful display of her amazing talent.My one complaint, which I have with all of Perla's CD's, is many of her songs are over-arranged. On many of her songs, she has too many instruments getting in the way of her voice. When the vocalist has the voice, I prefer simple arrangements, like early Joni Mitchell. Perla likes the complex arrangements and that's who she is. It's just not my style."
1,Dont buy it.,Call off Duty was easy enough to beat without the strategy guide. Unless your stuck and cant get past one of the first levels dont buy this. Save you money and get somthing else.
1,Waste of money,"It's not badly written or anything, but it's just useless. You can beat this game without any guide, and besides that, you can find most of it online anyway (for FREE!)"
1,Utter Trash,"It is not stated in the description, but you have ONE DAY in which to return the product if defective. And then you package and pay the return postage on a defective $6.87 purchase. However, in all fairness, I should state that the seller did post a full credit to my account.My clock makes so much noise it annoys me from fifteen feet away. Impossible to use in a bed room. Plus the knob used to adjust the time broke off the first time I turned it.Amazon, take this item off your website!"
2,Loud,This little clock ticks so loud you can't sleep. Also very hard to turn on the alarm becuase of the small buttons.
3,Perfect ... except for ticking sound,"PROS: easy controls, easy alarm to set, easy to read, good small size for a travel alarm clock.CON: Noise. Why do so many manufacturers produce alarm clocks (designed to be put near the bed) with an annoying tick-tick-tick?SOLUTION? On the bright side, the slight noise is not audible when I put it across the room, thereby forcing me to get out of bed when the alarm goes off in the morning!"
1,Noisy Clock,This clock is cheap and that has a reason: it is noisy ! the clock is very cheap and I should have expected it not to be good.I can not use the clock in my bed room because of the ticking noise.
1,Doesn't keep time,"This little clock doesn't keep time. It will slowly lose time until one day you realize that the time you have on this clock is far behind your other clock. You see, I keep this little clock next to my pillow so I will get out of bed according to the time shown. But every month I would find out that the time is wrong and that I am late. And no, it is not because the batteries are low, there's something wrong with this clock even with new batteries. I have this clock for over a year now, I have decided to discard it."
1,"simple, functional, perfect","This TYPE of alarm clock is the only alarm clock I ever own- and I have owned many of them over the years (they do not break, rather, I leave them places or give them away). It is simple, eaasy to set and read, reliable, it has a light, and the alarm sounds at just the right volume to wake you but not irritate you. This one, however, has an audible TICK_TOCK that is unacceptable and annoying!! I sent it back and am ordering the Westclock version."
4,I play this CD at all my parties!,"I loved Kenny Carr's first CD (Friday at Five) but Turn the Page really shows how versatile he can be. There is a piece for every mood - my favorites are Cadiz Sunset, Turn the Page, Going Home, Lost Tuesday, and I love he kicks it up with Soho Strut, Bleeker Street and a couple others. This is one of my favorite new CDs and I'll definitely be giving this one out as Christmas gifts this year!"
5,Review of Baldwin's 'Giovanni's Room',"One cannot help but marvel at the complex psychology of this narrative, with all its curves of suspicion and corners of uncertainty. Baldwin displays the mind of an individual reluctantly discovering a new piece of his identity. The work is thoroughly 'gay' insofar as it adopts an incredibly diverse personality. It seems impossible to say plainly what a gay man is, and Baldwin's narrative testifies to this impossibility. His narrator is observant, yet obscure. He shows us almost everything we might imagine ourselves to see, and yet the novel offers no conclusions."
5,Beautiful examination of love vs. convention,"James Baldwin's moving, insightful prose makes the case for alternate sexuality with believability and deep poignance. While a writer as great as E. M. Forster only skirted the surface of his homosexual feelings, Baldwin treats them with depth and clarity; indeed he makes the best case for the lifestyle since D. H. Lawrence in WOMEN IN LOVE with the Gerald/Rupert relationship. GIOVANNI'S ROOM goes much further of course, but in never becomes political as much modern literature does. Baldwin concentrates on the emotions, the painful beauty of love in its many forms, and the conflicts that become inevitable. Whether you're a proponent of 'alternative' lifestyles or not hardly matters; this book transcends such pigeonholing, as all great literature does."
4,Words of Oil on a Canvas of Paper,"Mr. Baldwin has a way of writing that makes every detail crystal clear. In Giovanni's Room, I feel as if I am the main character. I can feel the small room and the city is wherever I may be reading this fascinating story of confused love. The ending made me cry. A literary romance!"
4,"dark story, dark self consciousness","JAMES BALDWIN WROTE A NOVEL HERE, THAT JUST HAD ME THINKING ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS PEOPLE HAVE AND WHY. IT MAKES YOU TAKE A STRONG LOOK AT YOUR OWN JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE AND THE CHOICES YOU MAKE. I FELT THAT THE ENDING LEFT YOU WONDERING AS TO WHAT CHOICES THIS CHARACTER WILL MAKE NOW THAT HE HAS HAD THIS SELF-DISCOVERY. A GOOD BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A EAGERNESS TO FIND SELF."
5,A Masterpiece! Classic & Timeless,"James Baldwin's novel is a timeless, classic work. Everytime I read this novel I find new things and I fall in love with the book all over again. It is my favorite novel, period. For me the Paris that Baldwin writes about is not that far away from contemporary gay society. It is amazing how much has changed for the community while men (although not all) have remain mostly the same. There are certain parts of this book that will always remain with me, the shift in the narrative from present day to past memory, cental character, David's experimentation and later rejection of his friend Joey, David's first meeting with Giovanni, and the white, paint smeared window in Giovanni's room that separated two men in love from world that was not yet beginning to understand. In closing, I can't say enough how much I recommend this novel."
4,Weird ending,"I liked the story, although it seemed more like the outline to a great novel yet to be written. It was just too short. The only thing I didn't like was the sudden strange ending that was unrelated to the relationships between any of the main characters."
3,The death of love ...,"Baldwin's story covers the triangle love affair of David, an American living in Paris in the early 50's. In an age when same-gender sex was seen as abnormal - and indeed illegal in most countries - David struggles against his feelings for Giovanni, a young Italian barman he connects with whilst his girfriend, Hella, goes away to reconfirm her feelings for him. It is a fast read but covers magnificently - with style and elegance - the dilemma of a man at war with his carnality."
5,I am so glad I found this book!,"What a beautifully written book! I read it for my book club. I had heard of James Baldwin, but had never read anything of his before. I loved the depiction of Paris - the sleazier, decadent life underneath the beauty, and the depiction of the bars and the sad characters that Giovanni hung out with. The depiction of the main character's feelings for Giovanni and for his fiancee were just amazingly written - some of the best writing about feelings of love that I have read - the positive and negative. Heartbreakingly sad. Everybody in my book club LOVED the book - I think it is one of only two books which has received a 100% thumbs up from us all!"
2,And the point was....?,"James Baldwin is an overrated writer in my opinion. I've read three of his ""best"" works and am not just basing this sentiment on one novel. Giovanni's room begins excellently; it vividly captures the mood of Paris and its more colorful characters. It presents the inner conflicts of Jacques and the main character well. But by the middle, it goes downhill with stereotyping (Giovanni is the proverbial loudmouth chauvanist Italian who's prone to fits of rage and crying; Hella is the spoiled, scattered-brain blond with no backbone; and Jacques is the sad, empty queen). In the end the story becomes a melo/crime drama. And what was the point? The main character was always a cold, detached soul that never came to any realization at the end, wasn't changed, and made no decisions about his life and treatment of people. Even THAT wasn't made the point."
2,"""Just Above My Head"" is FAR, FAR BETTER!!!","While ""Giovanni's Room"" is a fine novel, Baldwin does a much better job with the themes presented here (identity, sexuality, place, etc.) in his later novel, ""Just Above My Head."" My personal opinion is that ""Giovanni's Room"" has received such positive praise and hype in the gay (white) community becasue the characters are white. ""Just Above My Head"" is ignored and bastardized because it dares to challenge conventional (racist) white gay norms by showing clearly that black men can and do love other balck men. Because ""Giovanni's Room"" falls into one of the two acceptable camps (no black gays at all or black gays with white lovers) it is accepted. Baldwin's writing skills are strong here, however, and his use of the European backdrop is excellent. The confusion, anguish, and tension that Baldwin is able to generate in relatively few pages is truly outstanding. A worthwhile read, to be sure, but not the author's best waxing on the subject."
4,"Although strange and foriegn, its idea is still compelling","This book was written a long time ago for a completely different audience. That being said, this is still a good book that gives insight on to the lives of people in France in the early 20th century as well as possibly opening people's eyes to the idea of homosexuality in a whole new light. Baldwin creates real people, that could be me or you, and puts them in a situation that isnt too far fetched to consider, and does a good job of showing how people act.Although it is old and slightly out dated, it is still an interesting and worth while read in today's world."
3,"Noteworthy Topic, But Not Worthy of Baldwin's Reputation","Giovanni's Room was a groundbreaking novel that exposed a topic rarely talked about, which is a surprise considering how bold American writers make themselves out to be. The topic offered something, but the book overall did not startle me for its perception and often I wished to give all of the characters a swift kick in the behind for being so annoying and for reading so much into so little. Baldwin is suppose to be, from his reputation at least, one of the greats. This book does not show his greatness, especially since he is known as a stylist and Giovanni's Room, with the exception of topic-falls flat and muddy. I would not discourage anyone from reading this novel, however, I would not encourage either. It was a decent read and, sadly, almost forgettable for an author of his standing"
2,Not bad (Two and a HALF stars),"I agree with one reviewer in saying that the book is not really about race or gender, but passion and pain, loss and ""what if's"". And I think that's why it fell short of my expectations. While you are told that the two main men feel this passion for each other, it's hard to internalize it because the writer has basically ignored what should be a necessary interrogation into the complete aspects, not just the nature, of their relationship. We get a summary of what their love was. I couldn't help wanting to know more - more about the room; about what they did together in a sexual, and day to day sense; about everything! Perhaps the characterization needed to be slightly deeper. Let's hear a bit more about Giovanni at least; it's apparent the main character can't describe himself better, being as he is completely unaware of his true nature. A bit more description and angst and this book would have had a bit more oompf."
3,Sorry it could not have been a better fit...,"I purchased this system because I loved the metal on metal construction, beautiful fabric and stylish design. However, after our baby was born I learned that the car seat was just too heavy and combersome to carry even with our now eleven pound infant. I also found it very difficult to snap the carseat into the stroller. The stroller also became ""jammed"" and therefore difficult to release when trying to open it. The basket is also unable to be used once the carseat has been snapped into the stroller. The pretty fabric was just not enough to make this system work for our family and unfortunately we had to return it. Hats off to BRU stores for there 90 day return policy!"
1,BASE needs to be RECALLED!!!! ZERO STARS!!,"The stroller and car seat...beautiful, stylish, lovely pattern and material but the BASE will kill your child! THE BASE is too narrow, swings, tilts, back and forth with every turn the car makes. I am lucky that my son was not flipped over. Used one time and will NEVER use it again. I do not recommend that you buy the car seat. The BASE needs to be RECALLED or someone's child will get hurt. I've written to Cosco and Eddie Bauer asking them to re-evaluate the BASE model. I will also write to BabiesRus for them to access the safety of this BASE."
1,Buyer Beware,"My wife and I purchased this system and assembled it with ease. After trying to install this cumbersome base and car seat in our 02 mercedes, I am convinced that we made a bad choice. It is extremely difficult to comprehend the several sets of conflicting instructions. The LATCH system that is provided only with base does not work with our vehicle. There is no LATCH system to use if you choose not to use the base. I have tried it several ways including using the latch system in combination with the vehicle saftey belts. This system is terrible. I would strongly recommend that anyone thinking of purchasing this system to look somewhere else."
1,Thank you-ignore rate as its required:),"Thank you so much to all of you who put your experiences out here for the infant car seat & base!!!! I was so in love with this travel system in the store. I am so thankful I decided to read the reviews and have deleted this off my registry completely! I cant even imagine being one of the parents whose base tipped over while the child was in it! Again, thank you for protecting other children & parents from the buying this faulty product!!!!"
4,No Problem with this System,"When I received this system I was skeptical because of all of the reviews on here. However, we have installed the base in our car(s) and it works perfectly fine no tipping at all. We did purchase a noodle type thing for the base so it's level but other then that's it's great. It is heavy but I can deal with the weight. I've been happy with this system overall"
1,EXTREMELY UPSET OVER CARSEAT!!,"AFTER WAITING 10 YEARS TO FINIALLY HAVE A CHILD WE HAPPILY REGISTERED FOR OUR BABY SHOWER. WE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE EDDIE BAUER ITS TRAVEL SYSTEM WITH THE MERCER PRINT. MY HUSBAND AND I PUT THE STROLLER TOGETHER (WE LOVE THE STROLLER), CARRIED THE CARSEAT AND BASE DOWN TO OUR MINI-VAN TO INSTALL AND WERE SHOKED. THE BASE, WHEN ATTACHED CORRECTLY STILL WAS COMPLETELY UNSAFE. IT TIPPED SIDE TO SIDE AND EVEN FELL OVER. WE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE INSTALLING IT INCORRECTLY SO BROUGHT IT TO AN INSTALLER, AND HE SAID THAT THE BASE WAS COMPLETELY UNSAFE AND NOT TO USE THIS SEAT. IT WILL BE GOING BACK TODAY. WHAT MADE ME EVEN MORE UPSET IS THAT THE MANAGER AT BABIES R US HELPED US PICK THIS SEAT OUT. SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT NEVER SAID WHY. THEY RATE IT AS A TOP PICK WITH PARENTS. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE. AFTER CHECKING THE WEB SITE WE FOUND THAT WE ARE JUST ONE OF MANY UNHAPPY PARENTS. THEY SHOULD RECALL THIS PRODUCT RIGHT AWAY."
1,Doesn't fit in my car,"I read the reviews before I bought this and I even called the company to confirm that it was safe and not going to be recalled. I can't see it not being recalled, it doesn't fit in my Saturn SC2 and I can't get it to fit in my husband's Toyota Tundra in the back seat. It just doesn't secure well, and in my car, my seatbelt isn't long enough. It's a beautiful product but I am going to have to return it this weekend.UPDATE: I returned it easily but I did it within 90 days and I hadn't filled out the warranty card yet. I ended up getting a less expensive Graco Mosaic travel system. It doesn't have as many options but it is much smaller and it fits in my trunk much better. I also brought the Graco seat and base to the fire station and had it inspected and installed in my car and it fits."
4,Great Stroller,"While I agree that the car seat is useless, I must say that the stroller is great. It is too bad this item is not sold separately. As a travel system, it is too pricey to have to buy a new car seat. However the stroller rocks.The stroller glides with ease, folds into a standing position, which is easy on a bad back. It has plenty of storage room underneath, a great parent tray and a built in diaper bag to save room for the undercarriage. Also, this stroller converts to a ""bassinet"" for when baby is very small. I enjoy this stroller better than the Graco and even a few Peg perego strollers I saw.In closing, GREAT STROLLER! Terrible car seat."
1,Recall on Manchester Eddie Bauer travel system,"I always wanted a eddie bauer travel system when I had a child, so when the time came I went and found the perfect one. First problem is the model in the store had suede on it and when I actually bought one it came in canvas cloth. Disappointing! Then after 6 months with this system I was stopped in the mall by a fellow mom to only be told that the travel system had been recalled. I am having a hard time finding a replacement with what they offer in the store and a huge inconvience!"
4,Base issues,"In reading the reviews, I had some concerns about the installation of the base and how secure it would be in our 2003 Toyota Sequoia. Our Sequoia supports the LATCH system, and after reading the instructions found in the carrier, my husband was able to install the base SECURELY in the backseat. It moves no more than .5 inch in either direction. The trick is, you have to push down on the back of the base, and pull the belt system tight. We also found the red elevator to be a deterence in keeping the base secure. So, we keep it retracted.I will admit that the instructions are tricky. There are too many sets of directions that are not consistent with each other.Other than spending an hour figuring out how to install the base correctly, we're happy with this system."
2,New Mom's Nightmare,I have never reviewed anything I have purchased but I just had to let other mom's know about this one. I registered and received this as a shower gift. I am now 39 weeks pregnant and we decided it was time to get the seat installed. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE!!! The base for the car seat will NOT stay in correctly. So I came on and read the countless other reviews. We did like the stroller but not worth it to keep both. We took the system back last night and got the graco fusion safe seat. Needless to say it took me 10 minutes to install the graco and it is perfectly safe. We bought the fusion stroller as well. It did cost more to buy them separate but we really liked it. I would suggest any graco over the Eddie Bauer the base is so much better and safer!!!
1,"unsafe, do not waste your money","I fell in love with this stroller when I saw it. However, like the other comments that I didn't read before I bought it, it doesn't secure properly, no matter how you install it. When I returned it, there was a women returning the same stroller, I asked her why, and she told me it was because she turned a corner and the carseat tipped over, WITH HER BABY IN IT!!!!! Thank god I never got that far with it. You would think, Eddie Bauer, with a very expensive reputation, and costing that much money would put a little more effort and testing into a system you intrust for the life of your baby!!!It's a very scary thought that you could hurt such precious cargo.Thank you for reading,Lulu"
2,Mistake,"I received this travel system as a gift, beacuse it was the one I registered for....BIG MISTAKE!!!! This is the WORST car seat/stroller ever made. The car seat is so hard to strap my 4 month old into, and the stroller weighs about 20 pounds, and takes up all the room in my trunk!!! If my daughter wasn't practically duct taped into the back seat, the car seat would fly all over the car, because the base doesn't hold her secure, it is very wobbly, and is easily tipped over on every turn."
1,What A Waste of Money!!!,I bought this set because I liked the print for a boy. This was my 1st child and didn't know what to look for in a carseat. This seat is AWFUL. It is extreamly heavy and bulky. The carseat base is very unsafe. It is so thin and narrow that nomatter how tight we put the seatbelt around it the carseat would still move all around. It was so bad the hospital would not let us leave until we had buckled the carseat in itself with the seat buckle. Another very unhandy feature is that you can't hook this seat into shopping carts. There are no hooks that latch onto the cart seat. This means that everytime you go into a store that you will need a cart for you will need to put your baby into a Snuggly or something like that. This adds about and extra 15-20 minutes onto a shopping trip not to mention wakes up a sleeping baby. This is the worst seat. The stroller isn't bad but not worth dealing with the carseat. Don't waste your money!!!
1,"Nurse Mom states ""NOT SAFE""","My husband picked out this travel system because of the Eddie Bauer name & we both liked the pattern. It was very difficult to fold this down & set it up. I practiced several times before the baby came so hopefully I could opperate it. When we delivered, the hospital had a nurse who would come out to your car to check to make sure your car seat was safely installed. We took them up on this offer!! We were very disappointed to see how unsafe this car seat was. It would slide side to side & was not secure. In a collision, this car seat would not be safe for our child.We took our baby home from the hospital in it, then immediately took it back to exchange it for something safe!!! My best advice- Buy Graco Snugride!!!"
1,Save Your Money!!,"I bought this a few months before my son was born, and it was the worst purchase I made. For starters, it was very difficult to install thanks to the confusing instructions. We ended up making it secure by using every seat belt in the back seat. It is also very difficult to strap my son into the car seat. I faced another problem when trying to use the stroller alone. I am not sure who thought it was a good idea to make the seat recline only. My son hates to ride in his stroller because he can't see anything lying so far back and the canopy doesn't extend far enough to keep the sun out of his face. This stroller is hard to push with two hands, and nearly impossible with just one. I drive a Pathfinder, and the stroller still takes up quite a bit a space.I am now stuck with a product a hate, and I have to buy a new stroller. Save your money!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this travel system for our first son. Besides it being so heavy, it is unsafe. We could never get the carseat to secure correctly. When going around sharp corners the carseat would either crash into the door or fall on it's side. I could have dealt with the weight of the system if it was safe. The stroller was okay, again heavy but okay. The only downfall was that I had a hard time getting the carrier to lock into the stroller. Thank goodness I had the forsight to buy a protection warrenty because I bought this 2 months before my son was born. I returned it with no questions asked & purchased a Chicco Cortina set. Love that one!"
1,DO NOT USE THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!,"This has got to be to worst design I have ever seen. Who would ever think a round object would work well against a flat surface? Yes it's a very beautiful system, but the carseat base is absoutly UNSAFE. Upon putting the base into the car even with car seat anchors built into the car the base will slide out of the anchor harness. Once installed, the base would slide completely from side to side. I am appauled that this is still being sold! We were actually told by Babies R Us employees that the actual car seat had been recalled but not the travel system, which contains the recalled carseat. Please do not put your precious cargo into this very UNSAFE carseat. (The stroller is great.)"
1,Certified Installer finds this unsafe,"We registered for this item and recieved it for our shower. As my husband and his friend (who is a firefighter) tried to install it they could not get it snug to the appropriate degree. We then took it to another friend, head of safety at our fire department and certified car seat installer, and she deemed it completely unsafe and to return it immediately. We have since purchased a Graco Snug Ride, and are much happier with the installation (Graco Snug Ride comes reccommended from the safety tech). While the print was great on the Eddie Bauer, and the stroller was incredibly plush, that is no reason to comprimise safety. Since this, the saftey tech has contacted Dorel, who manufactures this care seat base, in hopes to get it recalled.As the saftey tech said, 4 out of 5 car seats are installed incorrectly, so I would strongly urge you to take any seat for a quick trip to the fire dept and have them check it out."
1,Weird and Difficult Car Seat base,"Infant car seat and stroller are very nice, but car seat base is another story. We took the car seat for installation to local fire department. It took them more than 30 minutes to install which is very unusual. Here are some of the comments from them: ""Base it too narrow and looks very different""; ""Car seat should easily slide into the base""; ""It should not have taken more than 5-10 minutes to install car seat base"".I am definitely planning to take it back to Babies r'us and buy a NORMAL car seat."
5,DE made easy,It is an excellent volume. It refreshes my Differential Equation techniques adequately.
4,Excellent supplement,"My diff eq text sucked. I ordered this book to supplement it. As with just about all of their other products, this one cut right to the chase. It was very helpful in the respect that my text had almost no good examples. I will be getting rid of the text, but I will keep this for reference.The only real lacking feature is the organization of the material. Now it may just be me, but I felt the chapters skipped around a little much. But as a reference, does it really matter? The one thing I can't understand is the part about technology. Did you know that modern calculators and computers can perform symbolic manipulation? Sure you did! It would be nice if they just deleted this section, or preferebly, organized a new section about how to apply that technology, say with a ti-89, which most students at this level have anyway; the information on the ti-89 would also apply to the ti-92 and ti-200, eliminating redundancy. This would be most helpful."
5,Fantastic,"I got this guide in the vain hope that I would be able to learn ODE in time for my second exam (there were 3 exams-the class was 2/3 over and I hadn't studied since the first week). I was able to learn all the material we had covered in (a rather long and hectic) 3 days. The book was very easy to read and the problems very helpful. By the end of the class, I had studied for about a week total and, thanks to this guide, had learned the material.This book saved my a**."
4,Very Helpful,"I'm not one to say much so I'll keep this kind of short. It always helps to have another point of view and explanation other than those offered in the classroom, whether one struggles with this material or not. This book was definitely worth purchasing."
2,not the best schaum text,"First, it must be said that the Schaum Outline series provides an inexpensive way for students to get more practice and check their answers. In general, I recommend these texts. That said, I used this as a supplement to a DE class I taught and it was such a pain. The notation is nonstandard, symbols for Bessel functions are downright wrong and things like this. The application exercises were more focused on converting from English units to SI units than on the variety of application problems. To add to the fun, the cgs system is also thrown into the mix. Granted, engineers and the like need to be able to switch, but that's not the point of a DE class. It is nice to have sections on the Laplace transform and first-order systems and most exercises are ok, if repetitive. Students will have to work hard to keep the notation straight and not confuse themselves. I wouldn't use this in another class."
3,Unimpressed,"Very helpful if you are looking for a set of worked-out ODE problems; a bad idea if you are trying to learn the subject, or refresh your memory.PS. Holzner's ""DE for Dummies"" is one nice cheap beginner book - but I would still go for a ""regular"" textbook."
1,Self-Aggrandizing Apologia,"In these pages, Mr. Hentoff relentlessly promotes himself, without even attempting to reconcile his contradictory positions. He's the great civil libertarian, yet apparently he believes that women have no civil rights where there own bodies are concerned! He shamelessly flatters the late Cardinal O'Connor, completely distorting the latter's record on gay issues. I used to like Nat Hentoff's writings, but somewhere along the line, he took a wrong turn, and became a fawning sycophant of the right wing."
1,Too Cute and the Sheep Look Like Poodles,"This was an utter failure. The pastel illustrations of cute children with over-sized, tear-drop shaped eyes failed to earn even a glance from my two boys. I cannot fault the text, which is short and appropriately Christmassy. I can recommend this only to Precious Moments fans. Maybe little girls like this sort of thing? I don`t know though: the sheep look more like poodles, to me."
3,It doesn't stink,"This book has project management examples for use with MS Project 4.0 included. The macros don't work in the current version of MS Project. The macros are written in Visual Basic and I was able to debug through them, so I could at least install the material.The book was not well written, the narrators came across too stuffy. There is good material here, but I am having a hard time forcing myself past the middle of the book.I enjoyed the AMA Handbook of Project Management much better."
4,Recent (1995) strong high-level view of project management,"Well developed description of high-level procedures necessaryto the process of ""planning to plan."" CD includes exercises thatcan be used with MS Project 4.0, but the book is not tied to anyparticular program and is definitely not a software manual"
2,Glorified Shopping List; Needs Included CD To Make Sense,"It comes with a CD-Rom, but I was unable to install the 1995-era software on my system (I think due to x64 architecture). This meant the book was it, and as a book, it is BORING. The authors convey information in the form of bulletined lists, without elaboration. This means they dump loads of information without spotlighting which parts are important, or where to concentrate resources. Half of the book consists of supplementary material and exercises tied into the CD; useless without the CD.This book did not help me with effective project management."
5,I am better person because of Thrive!,"Felicia Scott is a truthteller who spurs you to action. She has a matter of fact way of presenting issues and solutions that actually empowers the reader. Thrive! is a must-read, especially for that person looking to grow and is willing to turn within to experience their own greatness. --Cheryl Smith, KKDA-AM, Dallas, TX"
4,"Nice watch, but not what I thought I ordered.","I ordered this watch as a present for my husband. When it was received I noted that in the picture the watch had a simple black face, but the watch that I received had a black face with lots of small detail. I was little worried about the returns process after reading the online reviews. However, I must admit that it was no hassle to return at all."
3,Singing Bible,"My children love the songs on discs 1,3,and 4. Then sing along everytime we are in the car. However, disc 2 does not work. We insert it and the player says error. I do not know who to contact on that.Other than that I would suggests this cd to all with young children!"
2,Outdated music will drive parents crazy,"I bought these CDs because they were recommended in a book I read about helping children grow spiritually. While there's nothing theologically wrong with the CDs, I didn't like the music at all. Frankly, I was shocked at how outdated it sounded. There's only one song I can stand to listen to out of the entire thing. Small children may go for it, but it will drive adults crazy! Also, I was expecting there to be actual Bible verses, word for word, being sung, and thereby teach Scripture memory. This, too, was a disappointment. On the positive side, it does do a pretty good job of telling the whole story of the Bible chronologically. I would recommend checking into other Bible song CDs that are less annoying, like the Cedarmont Kids and Praise Baby."
5,"Wonderful, fun overview of the Bible for Kids","I found this set of tapes several years ago. It is a wonderful set and has fun, upbeat, and catchy songs that appeal to little kids and older ones as well. I liked going in the car on long rides because I could listen to all three tapes. It makes the Bible (especially the old test) come alive and make sense in the big picture--not just little snapshots."
5,"Without a doubt, a worthwhile investment!","As much as my children enjoyed this tape, I must say, I never tired of hearing it. It is accurately written to entertaining music. Our first tape was destroyed, and I haven't hesitated to replace it. I highly recommend it to all parents. A great way to educate your child on God's Word."
2,:(,Songs are difficult to listen to. I was hopeful and disappointed. Songs were too long and not catchy.What more is there to say?
1,A sensitive subject that deserved much better. . .,"During the course of the movie it is important to ask yourself if you are really laughing with the two central characters or at them, at their innocence, their simplicity, their sincerity. It felt at times almost as if the words, dialogues were put into the mouths of these two characters and that they never would have said them had the been left to themselves. Cliches, american humor, everything...very disappointing. A subject that deserved much better treatment. A sensitive issue that perhaps should not have been handled the way it was. Very very disappointing."
2,This movie is not in good condition,"when i ordered the other sister, it said the movie was in perfect condition. I received it with a huge scratch running nearly all the way aound the disc. it will play only parts of the movie without skipping madly. I am rather disappointed."
4,A Joke,Did anyone notice the inside sex joke about when the male retard finds out he failed...he bends down and Julie=tte has that..um costume. I noticed the joke the first time and I found it wildly amusing...but i think most people missed it. Watch for the puppy bend down scene and um..smile.
5,The Other Sister,I first saw this movie on Starz and it was the most wonderful movie I have ever seen. The Actors and story line were fantastic. After my daughter saw it she kept asking for the movie.
5,Good Movie,The whole family really enjoyed the movie as well as the quality. Was exactly as I expected and for such a low price. Very happy.
4,This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen for all the wrong reasons.,"This movie, if it weren't for Juliette Lewis, would be really dry an boring and almost feels like a lifetime movie. Juliette Lewis saves it by being so bad at acting like a mentally challenged person that it almost seems as if she is just going around doing the most offensive voice she possibly can. If you are looking for something to make your girfriend think you are sensitive or something, buyer beware. You will not be able to pretend you aren't laughing til you cry. Just make sure she only sees the tears or is just as awful a person as you will learn that you are while watching this."
4,VERY WELL ACTED AND NOT OVERLY SENTIMENTAL! 3 1/2 STARS!,"This film could have been a disaster, but with a smart script, fine cast and some restraint, it turned out to be a very good film. Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are exceptional in this quirky tale of love and determination. With Tom Skerritt never more likable and Diane Keaton never more annoying(on purpose)this story of a young retarded women's determination to be independent is sometimes funny, insightful and heartbreaking! More importantly than her independence is her need to get from under her mother's thumb. She finds a friend in Giovanni Ribisi's character of Daniel and the two fall in love. I rate it 3 1/2 stars, but it's the kind of movie that I can see growing on me with repeat viewings."
1,"All star cast wasted in predictable, cliche ridden story",Excruciatingly long movie (130 mins) is very predictable and cliche ridden about mentally handicapped woman who seeks independence and finds love. All star cast is wasted in this movie. Get Benny and Joon instead.
2,The Mentally Challenged do the Darndest Things,"I'm sure this film had good intentions, and meant to present the very real challenges faced by those with mental retardation. However, the movie succeeded only in trivializing these challenges by turning them into a series of slapstick, buffoonish situations. Certainly the mentally challenged experience difficulties with many aspects of life; however, this does not mean that they completely lack all judgement and sense of social norms. This movie could have been a positive depiction of the experience of being a mentally retarded young adult. Instead it reinforcfed many stereotypes and encouraged the audience to laugh at the ""antics"" of such individuals."
1,Give me a frikin' break,"Okay, let's take the same crappy seen-it-before love story formula and add a twist: have the lovers be mentally retarded! This movie is awful due to the fact that it seems like it was made to cash in on the viewers emotions. And please, don't have people who can't act retarded do so. It wasn't believeable at all. Garry Marshall is a no talent director and will never even come close to being a great director due to this pile of trash. PLEASE don't be fooled by the falseness this movie carries."
1,All star cast wasted in predictable love story,"This movie might have been more interesting if it had explored some of the other characters. For instance, why is Diane Keaton so overly protetcive of her daughter? What about Danny's parents? Considering that the movie is 130 minutes long, it hits you over the head in establishing each point. Could have been tightened up to 90-100 minutes and been more effective.Highly predictable story of mentally challenged woman seeking her independence and finding love.Get Benny and Joon instead."
1,Garry Marshall What Happened?,"How I dreaded seeing this one, especially so soon after the cloying (how could any reasonable person have liked it?) ""Patch Adams"". But, as Albert Popwell said to Clint Eastwood in the original ""Dirty Harry""--""I gots to know.""Exactly what happened to Garry Marshall? What attracts him to tripe like ""Exit to Eden"" and ""Dear God""? I don't knock the idea of portraying two mentally retarded characters falling in love, but why do it in such a hokey, phony way? This movie rings so false, regardless of how much ""authenticity"" went into it, how much ""research"" the actors did to make their characters ""real""...Here is another (yawn) movie that is hung up on ""The Graduate"". There's a truly embarrassing scene here inspired by that classic. Early in this overlong film, one character talks about dignity. ""The Other Sister"" denies its characters the dignity they deserve; if the movie doesn't care about them, why should I?"
1,sorry,"I like movies about mentally challenged people. I Am Sam is one of my faves. This movie however isn't even worth a rental. It is unrealistic , boring , and it just dragged on. The humor is outdated and i didn't have any emotions for these charectors other than Diane Keaton who had a superb performance."
5,One of The Sweetest Movies of 1999,"I remembr when I saw this movie exactly! It was an early screening with Rushmore being the second film(it was two movies in one kind of deal). I sat 6 rows back from the screen and absolutely loved the movie. Giovani Ribisi is a great actor with so much talent. And it is wonderful to see Juliette Lewis back in the movie buisness and being ""clean"" again. The story is absolutely sweet and shows how love can happen to everyone. I will not give away the ending, but I loved it :) Garry Marshall is a brillant director. I definately recommend that you watch this movie with the one you love :)"
5,Must See,"I have only a few words to sum up this movie, A MUST SEE. The best movie of the year. It will make you laugh and cry. EVERYONE will love it."
5,Perfect!,"One of my mom's favorite movies. Was so happy to see her face when she opened it on Christmas, worked perfectly and arrived on time =]"
4,So sweet,"This movie is so sweet, sad, and funny and dramatic all rolled up in one. Lewis and Ribsi should've been nominated for Oscars or rewarded somehow, because they give unbelievable performances. You just feel for these two characters. Very sweet movie."
4,"Very sweet movie, Rabisi is especially good!!!","Good movie--I wouldn't go as far to give it 5 stars, but it is definately worth renting. I thought that Juliette Lewis was good, but fell short of believable as a mentally handicapped young woman. On the other hand, Giovani Ribisi did an excellent job and, never having heard of him before, had to check out the review to see if he was actually mentally challenged in real life. He was very believable and deserves an Oscar nod for his perfomance. Keaton and Skerritt also did well. Once again--worth renting!! A sweet, feel good film."
5,Old favorite,Great movie that’s hard to find. Bought it as a gift for a family member who was searching for it for a long time. No complaints!
5,A Must-Have Book for any Schoenhut Collector!,"I just love this book. If you collect Schoenhut dolls (or just one) you need this book. Beautiful photos of rare dolls, in depth history of the company, descriptions and examples of the the different models.... just a joy to read and look at."
4,"Plenty of mist, fog and sea spray to go around.","A long time ago, on TCM, I saw just a piece of the movie based on this book. I like these odd stories set in isolated places with plenty of strange characters so I decided to buy the book.I enjoyed this story because of it's oddness. Sure there are a plethora of unbalanced people but there are families just like this. The main character, Leah, manages to suck the life out of everyone she is in contact with and the reader can't help but hate her. All the characters have reason to hate her too so the reader is pretty sure one of them is going to do her in. Not so fast..............I like the descriptions of the Cornwall country side, the old house and the characters' mannerisms. There is more than enough mist, fog and sea spray to cover us all, I didn't find these descriptions annoying.The title, The Sign of the Ram, is confusing; it's a stretch as to how this fits the book."
2,A Few Gems...but Overall Disappointment,"""Best Little Stories From WWII"" is somewhat of a misleading title. While the layout of the text is admirable...numerous short stories that can be read at leisure...the content of the majority of the stories is bland and unmoving. While a few of the stories are worthy of great praise, I found too many boring stories about the world's naval forces during the time period. After reading such great books from authors like Cornelius Ryan, Stephen Ambrose and Charles Marshall, I find that overall this book is missing much by comparison. The only reedeming quality this book has for me is that of a coffee table decoration."
2,Misanthropic bile,"This is a most unusual book, of interest chiefly as that rarest of literary objects, a manifesto of pessimism. Dahlberg's intent seems to have been as much to display his bulging erudition and arch, archaic way with words as to decry man's slavery to the sexual urge. His ostensible subject is often buried beneath an avalanche of classical, historical, and anthropological allusions, but at least the book is riddled with eccentric epithets along the lines of ""Man is double, and who may know his heart: he is a moral hermaphrodite."" The author's tone is judgmental and defiant throughout, but that doesn't energize the book. The tedium of reading finally overwhelms any interest his oblique approach might provide, and there are no illuminating observations about the eternal itch, merely a catalogue of references to Greek gods, Mayan myths, and ""primeval potherbs."""
5,Half Moon Bay,"This is a fine album, and Gerry has put out a number of them. My favorite is The Bog Bodies and Others, but all of his albums are great."
1,"Great Comics, Bad Novel","JMS' ""Rising Stars"" comic series is fantastic - unfortunately, the novelization isn't. It adds virtually nothing to the story, instead plodding through the series almost page by page adding just enough description to let the faithfully quoted comic text make sense. Apart from as a service to the visually impaired, I don't know why this book *exists*. Do yourself a favor and get the comic version instead (the first sixteen issues are conveniently collected in two trade paperback editions)."
4,NOT for young kids,"Despite the erroneous subject listing, this collection is written for an adult audience. That doesn't mean that it is necessarily BAD for a young person to read it (there are other comics that are more graphic in terms of sex and violence), but slapping a ""juvenile fiction"" label on a work of art that is this mature and complex is a CRIME.JMS is a phenomenal writer in many genres. His venture into the world of graphic novels for grownups is a boon to the comics industry. This story is about kids who were saddled with special abilities they never asked for, and how they all grew up dealing with it. The series gives poignant insight into what it is like to have a misunderstood gift. It is also an ironic slant on the ubiquitous ""superhero"" genre that has dominated comics since their inception.Don't believe the Library of Congress label. Comics--they're not just for kiddos anymore."
2,Weak and cheaply done art hampers a good story.,"How many guys can you put in trenchcoats with long hair in a panel? Enough to not know who is talking.Top Cow cheaped their way through a number of artists to bring us a less than stellar tale. Chronic lateness, long term hiatus, dreadful art, cliche and insulting character design, the fact that we are given better writing and better art in Supreme Power and mostly the same story means don't bother.By the time a regular and decent artist was given the job it was to late and people were leaving this monthly title like rats leaving a sinking ship. I'd like to see Gary Frank start the whole series over at #1 so we can forget completely the first few issues. You will notice in the Amazon listing there is no mention of the artists on the first TP, only that there is a new cover by Gary Frank, the only highlight for Born in Fire.Dollar for dollar your payoff is Supreme Power."
4,Exciting superhero fare with extra dashes of smarts,"Collecting the first handful of issues from the original comic book series, ""Rising Stars: Born in Fire"" satifies on many levels. You get the things you expect in a good superhero saga (colorful characters, colorful costumes, fascinating powers on display); some things you don't see as often in such a saga (shadowy government conspiracy, a genuine murder mystery, varying levels of stability among the superpowered individuals); and, rarest of all in this genre, true thematic complexity (sympathies shift and morph, and shift and morph again). It's really a bang-up piece of work, and (never fear) a very entertaining one. I'm talking both about this first volume and the entire series as a whole, which gets more interesting as things progress. But don't worry, this first volume in itself is very, very good."
3,Poor quality control on this particular item,"We opened the box when we received the package to find it was damaged.I took a photo, but do not see where I can upload anywhere.I don't think this is the type of blemish that should have been let go.We may be able to angle the piece to where you don't see the damage, but Moen and Amazon, come on do a better job."
4,ken loach comes to america,"in carlla's song, ken loach explores love in the midst of hell when a reckless and irresponsible bus driver (robert carlyle) falls in love with a beautiful but suicidal nicaraguan refugee(oyanka cabezas). she is suffering from severe case of survivor's guilt and as the driver falls deeper and deeper in love with her, it becomes obvious that he is going to have to quelle her nigtmares and that means taking her back to a nicaraguan war zone to confront her demons. Ken loach's matter of fact ease with situational dialogue translates well into all of the necessary languages, and the result is a very special movie."
4,movie review,This was a good movie the players did an excelant performance. The only problem was some of the dialog was in Spanish and I didn't follow along with Carla. Otherwise wonderful love story.
1,Wasting money!,You can't understand 98% of the dialogue. No wonder Robert Carlyle didn't come to Hollywood to do movies. He can't enunciate! He peaked with Full Monty! It's a ridiculous plot!I bought it because I do like Carlyle on Once Upon A Time but not this. This movie is stupid and a waste of time and money.
1,Depressing and 'lost in..lack of translation',"I thought it would be a nice love story, but it is hopelessly depressing and not a happy movie. The worst thing about the movie is that somewhere in the middle; the director stop translating the spanish dialogue into english, and left us non-speaking spanish to figured out what was being said. The best part was the ending. No place like home."
3,Loach Not At the Top of His Form,"The first Loach flick that left me somewhat unmoved. A Glaswegian buser falls for a beautiful yet shell-shocked Nicaraguan refugee. She had witnessed some of the contras' attrocities (they were trained and armed by the US military). Under his large socialist umbrella, Loach stays outside of the perimeter on this one. No particular depth of the story, little warmth save the obvious sympathy. He's done much better in his starker, more uncompromising and less ""romantic"" flicks such as ""My Name Is Joe"" or any of his early Brit working class masterworks. Still, even the sentimentally toned down Carla's Song, mostly due to the terrific Robert Carlisle (spelling?)-is highly watchable flick."
3,Just OK,"The bag is great (not sure if it's waterproof), the lens cleaner works well, and the AC adapter is useful. However, I think the rechargeably batteries are not really good -- they never seem to fully charge. I got it for a great price though, so I won't complain too much"
5,Great selection of letters for the time-wary.,"One thing in another review I read that really sold this collection to me, was the fact that they're not making him out to be some insane martyr for the sake of art, which he most definitely was not. While I'd love the complete view on his life, I have neither the time nor effort for his complete letters, and this book seems to be a fairly good representative sample of his letters. I personally read these to watch his progression into an artist, and how he saw and overcame certain things."
4,Van Gogh,This was purchased as a gift. The recipient enjoyed it and thought it was a fascinating read.
4,great cd,well all i can say is very wonderful cd she gives god all the praise and glory and she is a great keyborad player and she has darwin hobbs doing back ground vocals and if you havent got any of his cds get some the best vocalist ive ever heard
5,For mellow-smooth Gospel lovers!!,"If you want to listen to something that's cool and calming, yet spiritually reviving, you need to pick this up. Don't sleep on this album!"
4,Biographies for H.S. students.,The authors provide short biographies of scientists from the United States in the twentieth century. Each biography is a few pages. Some of these were a bit dry while others were very inspirational. This could be a good book for H.S. students interested in science.
1,Waste of time & money,"As a student midwife, I was looking for the latest information regarding preeclampsia. This CD-Rom does not have any articles on it (as far as I can see) but just directs you to various web sites (mainly US govt sites). I can access better information using the databases and on-line journals that are available through Uni."
3,Los videos?,"ok debe estar en tu coleccion si eres fanatico ya que es un disco oficial, sin embargo la mitad del disco esta grabado con parte del concierto de las ventas, pienso que deberia ser completo de videos ya que hay muchos que no se colocaron, sin embargo se puede decir que los que estabn estan muy bien... La resolucion esta bien, pero no es excelente, me explico tengo un optoma a 720p y cuando se muestra alli la imagen ampliada no es perfectamente nitida"
3,shorts,the opening for the front smeems to be too small other than that i have yet to wash them or put them in the dryer.how they hold upfter repeated washings is the real test.
4,Satisfied Customer,"The product received was exactly as specified for fit and size. Exactly what I expected.Only disappointment was the cotton fabric. It is a lighter weight---like a ""summer weight"" cotton--- than expected from my order. The fabric is even a lighter weight than I previously purchased directly from a department store. (Hopefully this light weight cotton was used only for the production run of this item and is just an isolated incident.)"
5,Boxers are Wicked cool,I love wearing boxers. They are the best stop wearing those things and wear boxers. Boxers are the best and the chicks love them!
4,Hanes review,"It is true, the elastic wears out prematurely. However, it is still the best boxer on the market. Not drying these in a hot dryer will help extend the life of the elastic a bit longer."
1,Fly is too short and high,"I agree totally with the previous one-star reviewer on the idiotic ""gapless"" design. After I received the product Hanes emailed me with this message: Love it? Review it for our site. Get $4.99 off shipping on your next order. I submitted a one-star review, but they rejected it for failing to meet the ""guidelines."" On the Hanes site this awful product gets a five-star average."
5,"""""There is more here than I had expected."" , item as described...""",""" Quality of customer service , item as described..."" your online one-stop shop for savings and specials on our products."
5,Excellent product from Excellent Seller,This product is of high quality and fit very well.The product maintained the correct size and fit after washing and I am very pleased.My expectations were exceeded. Excellent job by seller.
3,Average,"I'm not a professional reviewer, but these are not very comfortable. The stretchable band around the waist is very itchy. Go with 'ComfortSoft' or another style."
3,NOT all cotton,"Very disappointed when I got the package and read in fine print on the back that they were only 55% cotton. I looked at the ads very carefully because my husband can't wear synthetic fibers. All it said was cotton which I assumed was all cotton. I see now that on one line it does say blend. So I have no grounds for returning it and it will go to the homeless shelter as I did not open the package. But FYI it's only 55% cotton/45% polyester. So if your husband is comfortable in plastic underwear, he may be happy with these."
2,Suggestion: Don't Order by Mail,"The bake set was ok except that the lid to the larger dish was broken. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not checking the contents until I needed to use it for a dinner."
4,Mr. Wood or Slappy????????,"When I first saw this book,I thought it was about Slappy.After I read this book,it was about Mr.Wood.Mr.Wood or Slappy????????"
2,Living doll,"Kris' sister Lindy is into ventriloquism and Kris is jealous of the attention she gets. She decides she wants her own dummy. But when she does, weird things start happening. Could it be the dummy?I've never cared much for stories about living dolls. This one is no exception. The story and the ending is nice enough, though, if you like that sort of thing."
2,track listing issues....,"I see there are two more import singles coming out in July. I happened to be in Tower and purchased a single with the same cover as this one, and a track listing like this:1. luny tunes reggaton mix (3:35)2. album version (3:45)3. sic element club mix (8:19)4. sic element radio mix) (3:47)My goal was to get the long house mix, which would be track 3 on my CD single, both the jewel sleeve and on the CD. INSTEAD, what I got appears to be the mixes listed on this single. All I got was a short version of the sic element club mix, and a few other mixes coming in at under 4 minutes. So, if you find this single out in the stores, be aware that you may not be getting what you expect. We'll see what the listing ends up being for the other 2 import singles due out soon. If anyone orders this copy from here, please post whether or not you got the single with the incorrect track listings like I did."
5,Loved it more than I expected,"I got this from NetFlix for my daughters to watch. Just a few minutes into the movie, and I was hooked. I pulled up a chair by the TV and didn't move until the movie ended. Not many movies have grabbed my attention like this one. We kept the movie for 2 weeks and watched it every night. After I returned it, I bought it from Amazon.I read the book which was really cute. They made the movie 10X better and I am totally in love with Toothless."
4,"Cute movie, good special features","This is a good movie, with a good set of special features that show some aspects of how the movie is created. Although predominantly a kids movie, it is enjoyable for adults as well."
3,Bad voice overs and lame dragon characters,"Want a cross between Toy Story and pokemon? You get this stupid movie. Since when do Vikings have an irish accent? Since this movie apparently. The dragons are laughable. Some look like they're straight out of a kindergarteners art folder. Not nearly menacing, and more laughable. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because the plot is ok. I expected more from pixar."
1,Not good for kids under 5,My daughter who is 7 and my son who is just turn 6 watched this movie.Then for 3 nights my son is having a nightmare that a dragon is chasing him. He wakes up 3 time at night screaming and very scared.
1,Boring!,"I don't mean to be rude, but this movie was horrible. I wanted to give this movie a chance because it looked cool and it looked better than the pop cultured fart joke films I see in other Dreamworks pictures (looking at you, Shrek). But when we rented it, I watched probably 10 minutes of it and had to leave the room because I almost fell asleep. Again, it looked interesting, but I was bored. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
5,"Great story, awesome animation!","I saw the trailer for this film on another Dreamworks DVD, decided I would check it out and I'm really pleased I did. For adults who enjoy animation, this has some incredibly realistic work of some very difficult images to capture, fire and water in particular, both of which are used extensively. The opening battle scene is impressive, presenting background information while capturing a chaotic ""fog of war"" feeling. The flight sequences are absolutely amazing. The story, too, is well-written: a universal plot, awkward teen comes of age, in the imaginative setting of an ancient Viking settlement. Some twists and turns happen along the way, but everything turns out right in the end. The pacing is great, not a dull moment, and some lesser-known but well-chosen actors voice the characters. Animation buffs will enjoy it, and it should keep the kids quiet as well."
5,Our family favorite!,My girls love this movie. It's a great story and cute movie. We watch this over and over. Always makes us laugh!
5,How To Train Your Dragon DVD,My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view. I think she has a fascination with DreamWork films.
5,Train Your Dragon,Good movie. My nine year old and 14 year old grandsons watched it with me. We all enjoyed it. Would watch it again.
3,Where's the Digital copy?,"I loved the movie--- loved it so much that I ended up reading the 7 books the movie is based from. The movie is definitely ""inspired"" from the books and Dreamsworks was successful in crafting their own version that would fit 1 feature length film.My gripe is that in purchasing this blu-ray, there is no digital copy. Unlike Disney/Pixar, their blu ray releases automatically comes in with a regular dvd and digital copy. Dreamworks, please step it up for your customers."
4,Fun movie,great graphics and a nice storyline. Good messages of tolerance.Kind of a horse whisperer story for kids and dragons
4,It's in the running for best kids movie of 2010.,"This was great, very entertaining, it flowed very well, hilarious and a good story besides. I loved it. My favorite quote was ""the only thing tougher and more tasteless than the food is the people"""
5,Love it!!!!,"This movie is great I love the dragon, his eyes are so expressive. The bonus movie in the 2-pack DVD is also very funny. This is a must have if you have children."
4,Fun for the whole family,"My two boys watched this for the first time last night. The three year old found a few of the scenes a little scary, but they didn't cause any bad dreams. I'm happy to have this added to our DVD library."
5,"Outstanding story, graphics and music!","I cannot say enough wonderful things about this movie. The story is great. The animation is awesome and breathtaking. The humor is wonderful. The music is phenomenal & moving. I think this is a wonderful family movie; full of laughter ,love and perseverance. After watching this movie, I can guarantee that you will want to own your own Night Fury!"
3,No extras?! What's the story Dreamworks?,Finally pulled the trigger and bought How to TrainYour Dragons 3D Bluray. I love the movie but I am more than disappointed in Dreamworks for not including any extras. Are the studios trying to make 3D fail? Why would I continue to purchase 3D disks at a premium and not get any of the content that is available on the cheaper 2D release? Other studios include everything in the 2D release with their 3D releases so I see no reason why Dreamworks can't do the same. I had also ordered Megamind 3D at the sametime so no doubt I will be disappointed with that release as well. This would get 5 stars if it was a full release.
5,Love this movie!,This movie arrived in a timely manner and was at a great price! What a great find! I'm so glad I found this and took advantage! My wife was definitely glad that I bought this--it's one of her favorite movies.
5,There be Dragons!,"After seeing what can be done digitally for a movie with Avatar I was actually more impressed with the detail levels How to Train Your Dragon went. You could stop the film at any one point and look for an hour at all the little details. The characters are all great, the story is incredible, the movie flows well, the jokes are funny and not just low-brow slap-shtick. The voices, directing... everything was perfect. I put this movie solidly into the top 10 movies of all time. The only reason why it did not do as well as it did was they did not promote it as well as they needed, the ads were not that good, and they opened up on the same week as the over hyped Alice in Wonderland. This is one of the few movies that when I walked out of the movies I said, ""That was an awesome movie!""You must also see this in Blu-ray. Do not watch it in DVD. This is one of the best looking movies ever made and needs this level of detail."
5,Awesome,"Absolutely loved this movie. I thought the soundtrack was moving, the story fun and unique, and the humor delightful. If you are an animal lover like myself, you will especially enjoy this movie. I highly recommend it."
4,"Great movie for little boys, especially!","My son is 3 1/2 and hasn't been that interested in movies. ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" however, was a big hit with him! Although some may think it a little inappropriate for a kid so young, he wasn't scared at all and knows it's all make believe etc. And he's been talking about the movie and asking questions. I love that it has captured his interest. I gave it 4 stars just b/c his older sister 6 1/2 doesn't enjoy it as much. A 5-star movie in my book is one that both kids want to watch over and over. Still, this is a great one--unique and has a good message!"
5,Taming a dragon,"I never knew how to train a dragon before, but this is an enjoyable look, from a young man's perspective on how to train a dragon and get a girl friend. Very enjoyable, indeed."
4,"Great movie, but extra disc not worth it","The movie itself is quite well done and should be popular for years to come. The bonus disk, however, I found very disappointing. The story and the animation for the extra story were not nearly the same quality as the title film. The bonus story was also very short. I wish I had saved a few dollars and just bought the single movie disk. Had I bought the single disk, I would have given it a five-star rating, but the disappointing second disk lowered my overall rating."
3,"Dragons...er, I Dunno.","As CGI animated films go, this is one that I think I'd place in my okay category. I don't think this movie is bad, but I don't this is the strongest either. The dragons don't talk and there aren't a lot of interesting side characters. The viking students are okay I guess, but there's no Furious Five in there. I do wish there was an actual treacherous villain instead of a Giant volcanic dragon. I think the story and characters are obviously too similar to ""Ratatouille"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", but that doesn't mean it's bad, just not as good as those films are. The side characters are kind of forgettable, but the only one I ever got sucked into was Astrid; all stone hearted and hard-core, but softens into a kinder viking because of Hiccup in the end. I think this film is okay, but it still needs a little work."
4,A nice family movie for a decent price.,Nice to have an instant download of family-oriented movies. And loved watching it a couple of times within our 24-hour rental.
5,DVD,This is the perfect DVD. There is not much to say about the unit other than we love the movie. Buying a new DVD is always recommended. Thanks for the great selection.
5,Nice movie,"Is a nice movie. I like that Gerard Buttler didn't impersonate his 300 movie voice here. It does have a Viking touch, but without overdoing it, really nice and sweet."
5,Caught by surprise.,Really awesome movie.I watched this movie without any expectations and just blew my mind.This bluray still has a very interesting short-movie. And the extras are very good.Definitely worth the purchase.
2,2-disc combo,"The movie itself I loved. I'd seen the film in theaters and just had to have it, so I bought the 2 disc combo pack; I now regret it.I was under the impression that the second disc was bonus materials and a second short film by Dreamworks. Instead I spent more time then I'd like to say just trying to find the menu on the second disc and finally found no second film and some really weak bonus features.I'm left with a second disc of no value. I recommend that the 2 disc combo be avoided for this film. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie, just stick to the single disc. This second disc isn't worth the extra money."
4,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,"Based on a nine novel series by Cressida Cowell. Focus is on a geeky viking boy who doesn't fit in with his rough and ready father's brute dudes. Along the way of trying to prove himself he wounds and then later befriends one of the toughest of dragon types that eventually lets him ride it. This is basically a well done tale of a boy and his ""dog"" with themes of acceptance at the forefront. My nieces and nephews loved this one. Adults should like it in varying degrees as well. The ending, which was bittersweet, came as a surprise. I didn't think they would push it that far but they did. The twins are the best kid supporting characters. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; DRAGON MYTHOLOGY: B plus to A minus; EMOTIONAL PLOT POINTS: B to B plus; VISUALS/3D FLYING: B plus to A minus; HUMOR: B; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of April 2011."
5,what a great movie,I waited awhile to see this movie. Now that ive seen it i wish i had taken the kids to see it in theaters. The characters are wonderful the plot moves quickly but not to quickly. Its a movie i can watch again and again. The message in the movie is great for ppl of all ages.The dragons were i think the best part of the movie they way they were designed for the film was great. I think this would be a great addition to anyone's media library and im sure it will be one to be watched again and again through out the years.
5,Really cool kids movie,"I took my 5 year old son to this movie and we loved it so much, we purchased it from Amazon.com as soon as it was available! My 14 year old daughter went with us, and she liked it as well. This was a very cute, touching story about misconceptions and how they can be turned around."
5,How to Train Your Dragon,This movie was fantastic. We own a black cat and the main dragon mimics everything that our cat does. It is a must watch for the whole family.
4,"Good story, appropriate PG rating - scary for little ones","My daughter is four and my parents let her watch this movie while she was visiting them this summer. At first it was pretty scary and she sat on my mother's lap throughout most of the movie, however, it is now her favorite and she askes to watch it everyday. The PG rating is appropriate and I would say it is a bit scary for the younger crowd (<5). The dragons spit fire and attack the city. The story is great though - a boy that does not live up to his father's (and society's) expectations of bravery, overcomes his fear and saves the town and the dragons. There is a pretty scary fight scene toward the end between the Vikings and the Dragon ruler, but in the end, good overcomes evil and the dragons and Vikings live in peace. I probably would have waited until she was a bit older (5-6) to introduce her to this movie, but it all worked out ok..."
4,Dragons,I found this movie very cute. My 2yr old liked it. And we'll i loved it as well. I was trying to buy it but it wouldn't give me that option. Until now while I give my review. Sigh.
2,How to Train Your Dragon,"i am very dissappointed to find that i purchased a film to collect that turns out to be short screen version. it takes much away from the enjoyment of the film. the movie itself is one of very few collectible films of this day. was worthy of good format also. i would have very much appreciated forewarning that my product was not the purchase i'd hoped for. i have collected only 3 films at my age of over 45, think that says enough. otherwise product in good shape. movie itself done very well. to the seller..... hope u correct this and be more detail oriented, there are almost as many tastes as there are people. in this particular product there really arent that many details to worry about. could ya please advertise as to whether of not the film for sale is shortscreen. i'd appreciate you for it!"
1,How to Beat Your Boyfriend,"Would you watch a movie featuring a female lead if her male love interest could not show her affection without physically abusing her at the same time? What if he punched her repeatedly? What if he hit her hard enough with a blunt object to bounce it several feet off of her flesh? What, then, if the female lead came to love the man who abused her in these ways? Would this film be good entertainment for your young daughter?It's terrifying that a female treating a male character the same way qualifies as children's entertainment. Unfortunately, How to Train Your Dragon openly depicts this kind of abusive relationship as a happy relationship."
3,They are back on track,"The story line is fake and nothing like the book, but it has very good morals. Such as do not fight something before you examine it. Another thing is that in the book Fishlegs is skinny and knows nothing about dragon and is hiccup's best friend, but in the movie Fishlegs is fat and knows everything about dragons and is not hiccup's friend."
2,They changed the price too quickly,I put How To Train Your Dragon on Blu-Ray w/ CD bonus from Amazon into my cart. I was just looking for one more thing to buy and during that time they changed the price. It was $17 something and now it's $26.99 which is more than what Walmart has it for. I may have to purchase my Christmas gifts elsewhere this year. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97Z6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,fresh in ways; formulaic in others,"1. Nothing like Americans to retroactively cram their values down the throats of alien cultures. Like I'm so sure the Viking women are gonna be donning battle gear and launching out on dragon-slaying expeditions right along with the men.2. Ultimately just another predictable ""our enemies aren't so bad if we'd just take the trouble to understand them"" flick. Hard to believe this stuff gets made during what is, after all, wartime. I wonder how vets returning from Iraq and Afghanistan feel about this trend."
1,"GRAT MOVIE, HIGH PRICE","I BOUGHT IT BECUSE MY WIFE REALLY WANTED TO HAVE IN 3D, I THING THAT THE PRICE ITS INCREDIBLE HIGH"
1,I don't get it,This is nothing like the book Dragons versus Dinosaurs in Xtoriez. Why does the dragon look and smell like a lizard? Black dragons are supposed to be cool.
5,Great movie!,I saw this movie in theaters when it came out. And then I saw it on amazon for 10 dollars and had to buy it! This movie has everything for both kids and adults! Recommend this for anyone!
4,"Was that ""Train"" or ""Tame""?","This was a great film. The story is simple and plays out in a rather straightforward fashion with few real surprises. However, in this case that's not bad. The writers clearly gave the story some heart and then went out to capture the hearts of the viewers. Despite being animated the characters feel real with emotions and feelings.There are not a lot of extras, but the ones on the DVD are interesting and the interviews demonstrate the love and care that went into this movie. Dreamworks created a winner here, this is definitely a movie to have in your collection."
5,LOVE,This movie is AWESOME! We love it. So cute andlove the dragons. One of my 4 year olds favorite movies
5,"Awesome story, excellent graphics!","This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. The fast pace of the story, the amazing graphics and the morals portrayed make this an isntant family favorite."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"Everyone else pretty much said it, but i'd like to say it again.This is a film for all generations, and is an instant classic. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has it all; Action, stunning imagery, emotion, pace, gripping story, and very endearing characters!For the record, I am 36."
3,"Small, yet big glitch problem","There is a point very near the beginning of the film (during the first dragon attack of the movie) that has a slight glitch/stick/freeze point. I can watch all up til that point (literally only about a second or two of the movie) with a problem, but when I get to this point; I can't do anything except skip to the next chapter and rewind to the point where it freezes. The movie then continues throughout the end like nothing is wrong.Overall, a good buy just because I love the movie, but because of that little issue; it is only good instead of great.But Thank You anyway! :-)"
5,Great kids movie...,Always something we go back and can watch again and enjoy... a must have for your video library. You cant go wrong with it!
4,dragon,good movie the grandkids really love itvery well donewould really recommend this movie especially if you have kids
5,Wonderful Movie.,"A wonderful movie. I want to ride my very own trained, pet Dragon. Who on earth wouldn't.I will watch this often."
4,Excellent movie,"Excellent movie for kids & grownups.Interestingly,. no cheap jokes,. dragons did not speakThe last portion may look a little dramatic still ok to enjoy.Overall nice to watch again."
4,Great movie,"I bought this movie for my daughter who is 3 and a half. She absolutely loves this movie, she watches it over and over again."
4,Great BD !,"My first purchased item from Amazon.com and definitaly a great choice !Amazing video quality specially in a 32"" LED TV !The extras and special history are also special too !There is PT-BR subtitle for everything (movie, extra, etc.)"
5,great movie,this is one of my favorite recent family movies. i love all the characters and images in it. great for family night or a night in front of the tv by yourself.
5,Good,"I'm not so crazy for every cartoon movies, but when children's in the house, you are having any choice. Great movie, really enjoyed with the whole family."
5,Good movie.,"My wife and I, as well as a friend, watched this movie. All three of us agreed that it was excellent. I really enjoyed this."
5,Great movie,My son Dan is watched this and loved the story line. The product was shipped quickly and arrived quicker than expected.
5,5-Star 3D movie!,"Amazing 3D, emotionally moving storyline, and an original plot. What else could you ask for?If you want to enjoy your 3DTV as much as I do, get this movie.I don't know about you, but I think Disney's Pixar is up for a competition here."
5,"great movie, my wife and I really liked it.",I really enjoyed this movie when I watched it with my wife but we thought it might be a little too dramatic for our son when he was three but we watched it a few weeks ago now that he is 5 and a 1/2 and he really liked the whole movie now.
3,Ole's review(6 yr. old),"good story, loved the ending. some intense parts, maybe a little too much for sensitive kids. I am 6 years old. not a funny movie, but a good movie."
3,technical difficulties,"While the film itself was charming and great fun, I apparently got a defective DVD because the film began to stop about half way through and continued stopping and starting throughout the rest of the film. This made it difficult to maintain a flow to the story and became really irritating. As for the film itself, the animation is simply spectacular and the story heartwarming. Hopefully I'll get a good copy someday and get the uninterrupted experience."
4,VIKINGS AND DRAGONS RULE!!!,"I was hooked since the first time i saw the trailer. There were different types of dragons and awesome looking vikings, specially the leader of the vikings. It has many funny and touching moments, i'm anxiously waiting for the dvd. This is definitely the best i've seen form Dreamworks, they keep getting better and better. I took my family to see it and they all loved it. This is a keeper. It's not just for kids, i'm an adult and i love these types of films. I wonder what Dreamworks will do next...VIKINGS AND DRAGONS RULE!!!"
3,Not a big fan,I rented this movie on demand. I have to say I am not a big fan of this movie. It dragged and wasn't really funny. I would only suggest to rent this movie and not to buy. It's not one I would watch again.
3,Not as funny as the commercials,"From the commercials I thought this was going to be a more humorous tale filled with slapstick comedy. Alas, most of the funny scenes were shown in the previews.The movie was entertaining, but nothing spectacular. I did not watch the movie in 3D.The story seems a tad mature and a bit violent for younger children. PG-13 would be excessive, but take some warning. Threatening to cut out a dragon's heart seems a bit much for the 6 year old crowd."
3,Moderately entertaining (and moderate = 3 stars),"5-star ratings are way, way overused in Amazon reviews. To many people, almost every movie they see is 5 stars. On the other hand, giving this movie 1 star is unduly harsh. I'm right in the middle.It was a moderately entertaining movie. I was a bit annoyed by the accents; adult Vikings apparently talked like Scots, while young Vikings talked like 21st century American teens from the Midwest. Also, the story and the animation would both have been striking many years ago. Today, they are pretty routine."
3,"Cute, good for boys","My nephew would probably love this movie. Not the typical animated film, with a second layer that adults love."
5,Very Cute Movie,This movie was extremely cute! It was fun to watch it over and over again because it never gets old.
3,Decent,"It's taken me a while to get around to watching this movie, but now that I have, I'm glad that I did. Although it wasn't anything great, it was an enjoyable way to pass a few hours.Unfortunately, what keeps this movie from earning a four or five star review from me is its pacing. The start and end felt very rushed. I thought there were too many action sequences, and they dragged on a little too long. I could not help but think that the action was there purely for spectacle-some of the scenes certainly did not warrant the amount of time given to them.This was not a hilarious movie, but it did make me chuckle in places. I thought the dragon was cute. I did wish more time had been spent to developing some of the other characters-they didn't feel like they had much depth, and that was a shame because there was potential there for them.Overall, this is a fun movie but nothing special. Don't go into it expecting too much, and you won't be disappointed."
5,Great little Kids video,"Even though it is great for kids, adults love this movie too!! It has learning lessons that kids need to know about."
5,DreamWorks really stepped their game up with this one.,"Like many of us, I have been a fan of DreamWorks titles ever since Antz. DreamWorks Animation, in my opinion, has always been ahead of the game as far as animated film studios go.When How to Train Your Dragon came out though, it certainly showed DreamWorks at their best. Why? Because this movie delivery absolutely everything that you would want in an animated family film:-A worthy plot and story? Check-Comedy? Check-Worthy, likeable heroes? Check-Interesting Antagonist? Check-Good pacing? Indeed-Satisfactory ending? More than so-Good visuals, effects? C'mon, this is DreamWorks we're talking about here."
4,Good movie,"This movie is really good. The dragons are very cute! I like Nadderheads best. Overall, this is a great familly movie."
2,How to train your dragon,I couldn't watch this movie. It was not at all what I thought it was going to be. It was very slow in the beginning and I had heard it was such a good movie but I cancelled it about 1/2 hour after it started
2,How to Train Your Dragon,"The movie was excellent, but about 10 minutes before the end, the DVD quit and we don't know what happened. I bought this for my grand-daughter."
5,Great Movie,"This is a great movie. I highly recommend it, as it is truly an original story with a gripping plot that is fun for the whole family. I am a huge fan of animated movies and this is one of the best I have seen. You know you are getting a quality product when you pop in a disc that says either Pixar or DreamWorks. Not to take away anything from Toy Story 3, but I thought this was better. Gerard Butler is great, and Jay Baruchel provides the quirky kind-of-off performance that shines through in this epic tail. Give it a chance, I am sure you will like it."
4,Very Entertaining!,"This one is worth the money: Entertaining story, good character development, good voice over work, great action. The flying sequences alone are worth the price of the film! My young son loved this movie and enjoyed acting it out with his toy dragons. Fun for the parents to watch also, which is a bonus. (note: I only rated this one 4 stars because there is a little mild violence in this-namely hitting with objects & fists-that might be too much for some young kids)."
5,adorable,this is a perfectly adorable movie! I can watch it with my little girl over and over and I enjoy it as much as she does
5,Friendship at its Fury-est,"A very heartwarming tale of bridging gaps created by lack of deeper insight. It's also a story of following your heart, even if it means going against all odds."
4,Get the Single Disc Edition,"This is a review of the Double DVD Pack Edition, not the movie itself. I bought it because it seemed like all the special features had been included in the ""Boneknapper"" DVD and so I figured I had to buy the extra disc to get them. Not true. The ""Boneknapper"" DVD has a few short ""features"", most of which are games and print-outs. There are a few ""Deleted Scenes"" but most of the dialogue was included in the movie already. These scenes are more like earlier/alternate scenes that do not add much insight into the movie. Not what I was looking for. The ""All-New Dragon Adventure"" is cute, but only about 13 minutes long - not worth spending an extra 7 or 8 dollars to get it. Basically, my advice is save yourself the money if you are planning on buying this movie and get the single-disc edition instead."
5,This movie was an unexpected treat!,"I loved this movie. It was exciting, creative, and clean. I can recommend this for kids. I have 3 young ones and really appreciate good, clean animated movies. Thanks Dreamworks."
2,Review of Blu-Ray 3D release not the film.,"This is a prime example of why 3D is having trouble taking off for home viewing. Dreamworks's decision to hold back so long on releasing this film on Blu-Ray 3D was almost as painful as the version we did finally get. Sure, it's great to have it in 3D, but with no special features, and only available at Best Buy it is almost insulting. The film is great and the best 3D I have ever seen so it's a must own if you have a 3DTV, I can only hope Dreamworks wakes up and gives it the proper release it deserves."
4,"Great story, great animation","This is a pretty standard coming-of-age story but is presented in a way that makes it fresh and entertaining. The characters, animation, and voices were all great, and of course how can you not love Toothless the dragon? If you couldn't guess, Toothless is my favorite character! Kids and adults alike will find something to enjoy in this movie. I don't think you can go wrong with this one. There's not much more to say without going into spoilers, so I'll just say I highly recommend it."
4,Great movie,An excellent submission from dreamworks. They are showing a very capable toe to toe match-up with Pixar. Must see movie!
4,Great movie for kids,We have two boys that just love this movie (particularly the 3 year old). It's entertaining for parents too. The combo pack is great as we keep the Bluray at home and can take the DVD in the car with us.
5,Great Movie,"My boys, ages 2 and 3, LOVE this movie!! It's been on a loop in our home since we received it."
5,GREAT!!!,I got my package wicked fast and the DVD was in an awesome condition as well. I could feel that they really care about their customers and I absolutely would recommend buying through Omers Treasures! Great people and I absolutely loved my experience.
5,Great Movie,I got this movie from a friend and loved it so much that i got it for my self. Found it here at a great price.
5,VS733 Vacuum Sander; better than I expected,"Sanding joint compound has always been just too dusty, but with the VS733 I had no dust in the air, or on me (I was repairing a ceiling), all in the vacuum. Great product, and very well designed for easy use."
2,Didn't do anything,It dried out my skin and didn't heal anything. But it hid it well like a concealer. That's about it.
2,"It may work, but the smell....",I don't know if I'm going to be able to continue using this product long enough to evaluate whether it works to clear up my acne or not because the smell is just too bothersome. I put it on before bed and wake up in the morning still smelling it. My husband complains of the smell as well.The tint and the texture that bothered some people was not a problem for me - just the smell.
3,"like it, but found something better","This has alcohol in it. booo! bad for skin, very irritating. use De La Cruz 10% Acne ointment instead, works wonders and no alcohol. Find it amazon, also at foodmaxx grocery stores and maybe other mexican food places. The benefit of acnomel -- can be work in the day time, and men probably will like that coloring/cover up option. De La Cruz is an overnight kind of thing."
4,Good to have around for sure,"Acnomel works pretty well. When I get a big honkin' zit, this stuff helps to dry it out and shrink it within a night or two. Use extra moisturizer before applying acnomel to avoid flakey spots. It's not a flattering smell, but I use it at night so nobody cares. Or even during the day if I apply a slightly smaller amount, then my makeup goes on after that (after acnomel dries/absorbs into skin) so the smell is pretty well covered up. I either wear it at night or wear makeup (foundation) over it, so I'm not concerned about how the tint is off (though it's not too badly off anyways). I highly recommend this to acne sufferers. It's not the only thing you should have, but it is an excellent addition to your skin care products. The bottle seems to go a long way, and it is totally affordable:)"
4,fun shoeshoeing,The Redfeather snow shoes that I purchased delivered what they said. They are easy to use and I like that it was complete with pools and bags to go with the snow shoes.
2,Other films have done it better...,"""Monsieur Ibrahim"" does have its moments, to be sure, and there are some charming similarities to the far superior ""Les Quatre Cents Coups"" of the French New Wave. But the film lost me a little with its sanitized view of sex (all the sex the boy has in the movie, and not once does he get a venereal disease, or get someone pregnant, or have any real regrets after visiting prostitutes{all of whom seem to have hearts of gold}). The film wraps up quickly with only a vague sense of growth in the boy turned man. A much better road movie (though different in many respects) is ""Central Station."" Better screenplay, better story, deeper meaning.But, yes, it was great to see Omar again. Hope to see more of him soon."
2,Not what I expected,"When I saw the title of this book, I expected a tongue in cheek exposition of classic rock songs and their ""meanings"". However, rather than being humorous, this book is quite serious. It is sort of like reading a secular version of ""Our Daily Bread"" or other religious devotional guide. Each entry has a brief but interesting background on the artist and the song (the reason for two stars rather than one), followed by a reflection and some questions or exercises designed to put into practice the lessons taught by the songs. These reflection and question sections are overly serious and didactic, and it is the contrast between the somewhat ""cute"" concept behind the book, and the ""preachy"" tone of the meditations that makes it quite unsatisfying."
4,Great books come to those who wait,"I am a great fan of Shakespeare, so when I bought this book what I was expecting wasn't what I saw. I saw the most intriguing sonnets probaly ever known to man. It wasn't all about love and fear. It was involving a great many things. It had all the human feelings, sadness, happieness, hate, love, curiosity, fear, pain, grief, stress, and you get the ideal. I don't want to give it away so if you seem interested read this wounderful book."
3,The last release with the original line up.....,"You have to approach this one with an open mind. They intentionally go in non metal directions on a few tracks. It is a pretty good album though, give it a few listens. The chemistry of the original line up was unique, and this cd actually has some real standouts. ""To the Devil His Due"" is classic DH, and the limited edition has bonus materials such as the extended version of ""Makin' Music"" and ""Sucking My Love"" live. Original bassist Colin Kimberely and drummer Duncan Scott exited after tracking their parts, marking the end of that era. It took me forever to find this album, without the 100 dollar out of print/import price."
3,"you gotta love the album, or be a die-hard fan","by no means this album re-issue is representative of the band's material. for someone looking for an summary of the band's early years (and even some of the later), it is best to choose ""Am I Evil?: Anthology""Am I Evil?: Anthology, while the re-issue of the first album, ""The White Album""/""Lightning to the Nations"" is also a very good output by the early Diamond Head. still, this album does have a few great songs (which again, can also be found in the anthology), such as ""Ishmael"" and ""Knight of the Swords"". the last bonus track is an interesting interview with Diamond Head's lead vocalist, Sean Harris. unlike these bonus-tracks-interviews, which tend to be too long and too boring, this one actually gives an extra value. I found out that it seems like Diamond Head's leading forces are not in the same mind as you'd expect from a heavy metal band. it's interesting to hear Harris' influences and his ways of working, writing, and producing music."
4,"If you love ""dirt"" (real dirt:soil) you'll love this documentary","Other than the unnecessary nudity, (it was supposed to be artistic) it was a great documentary on the need for CSA's and that people need the farm and the farm needs people. We need to get closer to the source of our food and be part of its production. It was also a great story of one man's journey into individuation or following his own destiny in spite of a lot of opposition."
4,"Fun, quirky, enlightening, and dramatic!","I caught part of this in the middle of the night on PBS or something and had to see the whole thing. What an amazing story about the food we eat, the politics, the short-sighted mega-food companies, etc. This real-life character somehow chronicles it all in a fairly objective and humorous way. Truly engaging and enlightening."
3,Zero Star for the Distributor: Interama Video Classics,"Interama Video Classics did a very poor job in releasing this classic movie on tape. At about 2/3 of the movie the English subtitles seize to show up for about 2-3 minutes leaving the viewer without understanding the otherwise powerful dialogs.The English translation is very poor anyway and this pause in translation is very annoying. The distributor should have done a better job of weeding out basic technical errors like this. I first purchased a used tape and thought it was a glitch on that copy. Then, I purchased a new copy and it had the same error in the subtitles. The movie still could be enjoyed with this problem but such a classic movie should have been treated with more respect and attention."
3,90s style indie rock,"Pavement and Sebadoh were two of the most influential indie rock artists of the 90s, and their impact on Staggering Statistics is pronounced. About half the songs are pavementesque with their trademark lo-fi sound, relaxed-tossed off vocals present on the album. On the other half of ""All this and more"", Sebadoh's distorted bass, edgier, and more aggressive vocals are represented strongly. Some bands don't separate themselves enough from their inspirations, and this is the biggest issue with Staggering Statistics. If you yearn for 90s flavored indie rock you should give Staggering Statistics's ""all this and more"" a chance."
2,Not sure about this product,Perhaps I don't know much about buckwheat pillows but this was too firm for me. Maybe it breaks down over time.
3,Rember only the Dashplate and not the brackets..,Installed into a 2005 Jeep liberty as a temporary fix until another Dash plate with brackets arrives. This should be called Dash plate NOT a Dash plate Kit.. but in fairness the Dash Plate does fit nicely in dash with an aftermarket Pioneer stereo system.
5,An adult fairy tale,It is a pity that George MacDonald is usually thought of as a writer of children's stories. The Golden Key is a fairy tale but there are few children indeed who will truly appreciate the symbolism and mystery of scenes like the journey through the valley of shadows. This one has me thinking and wondering for weeks after each time I read it.
5,A Lovely Allegory,"""The Golden Key"" is a wonderful tale, written with great skill. I have to admit that I have not seen this version, but illustrations by Sendak should be excellent (in fact, perhaps enough to tempt me into purchasing a 2nd copy!). I would like to point out that C.S. Lewis considered George MacDonald to be one of his greatest inspirations, and if you enjoy his works (Chronicles of Narnia, Screwtape Letters, etc.) you should truly enjoy this."
4,Very informative DVD,"Have a copy of this DVD, and must admit it is a very nice, all-inclusive guide to Afro-cuban drumset. There are many styles demonstrated, and is very easy to navigate. All skill levels, especially those in the least ""black belt"". Well done."
5,Afro-Cuban Grooves,"Great instruction from a master percussionist! If you are an intermediate to advanced drummer, you will find very useful latin grooves depicted in easy to read format."
5,The predecessor to british lit addictions...,"This was the first book I read in this literary period and genre, and was also the cause of my love affair with 18th century british satire. Not only is Fielding worth reading, but his essays, books, novels and plays are fantastic insights into Fielding's political impressions of the age. Do not stop with this book...read as much Fielding as you can get your hands on. I would also recommend Tobias Smollet and Daniel Defoe's lesser known stuffs. If you seek emotional balance, turn to Samuel Richardson's stuff and then go back to Fielding again. The Pamela/Shamela dynamic is a fantastic read."
2,TOO MUCH FOR ME!,"This book is so well written it was a shame I could not finish its almost 900 pages. I simply found the tale too silly, too uninteresting to continue. It seemed just to be the rather mindless adventures of the hero, Tom Jones, as he fights over women, fights with soldiers and his friends ... with everyone. I need something a bit more serious and profound. I even watched the overly long film as I read, and even found the film to be inane. If you like light-hearted nonsense with lots of characters coming and going, then you might enjoy this. It was just not my style, although the actual writing is great!!!"
2,"It may be satiric, but it sure was a snoozer ...","I did not enjoy reading this book. I love books. I love literature. I love to read. Tom Jones, I did not enjoy. There was simply too much. I am quite certain Fielding was smart. I am sure he was a good writer. However, no one should have to wade through almost 800 pages of a person's life. Before reading this book, please prepare yourself for a long, sometimes dull, journey."
5,A hillarious romp,"Undoubtedly, this is Fielding's master work. Few other novels can stand comparison to the wit and wild humour of Tom Jones, and the touching misadventures of its characters. Epoch making in its time, none of its charm and worth has faded. You will be hard put to find another novel quite like it. It displays much of the risque writing typical of the 18th century novel, though not to the level of, say, Defoe (and certainly not de Sade!). It is a hillarious romp, which also holds a mirror to some of the attitudes and foibles of 18th century Britain.The Wordsworth Classics edition is inexpensive and perfectly serviceable - an excellent choice if you just want to be able to read the novel and aren't looking for a library edition."
5,Dickens' Predecessor,"I am tempted to say that just as Marlowe paved the way for Shakespeare, Fielding paved the way for Dickens. I do not have one single complaint about this book. The images are wonderfully portrayed. The main character Tom has many dimensions. He is a rogue, a bumbler, and a womanizer. But at the same time he is heroic, brave, and honorable. Mr. Allworthy is memorable as the virtuous guardian of Tom. Sophia is memorable as a woman with a mind of her own. One of the greatest things about this book is that even though it is over 800 pages long, it is NEVER boring. We are either in suspense, feeling pity, feeling sorrow, or trying to control our laughter. This was the 3rd book I read in History of the Novel. While I did not like the first 2 at all, I REALLY liked this one. It is interesting that Charles Dickens mentions this book in his ""David Copperfield"" (1850). If you like this book, you MUST see the movie where Albert Finney plays Tom."
3,Not much of an Indian feel,"Typical Kitaro sounds, but this could've been titled, Mountain Meadow or Inner Playground or .... I didn't get any sense of India in any of the selections."
1,kozak/springfield,"Rachmaninov has some works of astounding beauty--I'm thinking of a number of his piano preludes, and his 2 Elegaic Trios. This opera is not one of his masterpieces--it's an early opera, interesting gypsy love story, but rather mundane musically. The final 2 scenes show some glimpses of brilliance. Overall, I'ld rate this a ""don't buy""."
2,some good leftovers,"Tindersticks are well presented in my CD collection. Only this one perhaps shouldn't have been added. The usual intens listening experience makes place for waiting something better to turn up. But even the bonus CD does not bring relief. The alternative versions are often less exciting as the originals. It could be the missing of Stuart Staples voice on the main part of this album, although this is not the case while listening 'More Trouble Eveyday' over and over. Or the little amount of string arrangments. But I'm affraid it's the feeling being Tindertricked with some leftovers. It's a good thing Stuart Staples' recently released solo album makes up in any way."
5,Potter never talks down to children!,"I was given this book when I was ten, and it is now a favorite of my three year old. She especially loves that Mr. Jeremy's house is ""slippy-sloppy"" and that he likes getting his feet wet. The story is fun and funny, and Potter's use of language is intelligent. This is the kind of book that inspires children to be better speakers. Any children's writer who uses words like ""disconsolately"" is five stars to me!"
1,not as advertised,The paperback version sold here is literally a cheap laser print of low-res images downloaded from the internet. Complete ripoff.
2,Poor qualirt,This book is much smaller than I expected. The printing quality is poor and it looks CHEAP ! It was for a gift and I was embarrassed to give it. I was really surprised and disappointed!
2,Small and boring.,My husband bought this for my son thinking it would help him crawl. This toy is about the size of my hand and very boring. It crawls side ways (I guess to be like a real crab) but only crawls for like 2 seconds and then stops. I don't think I would recommend buying this.
2,Is it PVC free,I don't like the smell of this cover. I don't know whether it is PVC free. PVC is bad for health.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this as a clear cover for our table to use when playing dominoes and such. It came folded with hard wrinkles at the fold lines. I've tried removing the lines with a hair dryer, and can't get the wrinkles out no matter how hard I try. It was a waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
3,Same quality as the one you can purchase at walmart,"The quality is okay. It's the same as the $5 one i purchased at Walmart. I read other reviews, and expected this one to be thicker. But it is not. So do not set your expectation too high. You will be dsappointed."
5,Great tablecover,"Great for using over my good tablecloths so I don't ruin them. They are very sturdy and thicker than I thought, which is great! Would recommend for anyone who wants a clear cover for a good tablecloth."
1,Looks like it was used!,"I purchased this to place over our oak table in order to protect and show off the wood. When I opened the package the cover was covered in dust and looked like it had been sitting in someones warehouse forever. I worked for 45 minutes wiping it down, flipping it over, wiping the other side down, and it still looks like it has been sitting on someone's table for a year! Too much of a hassle to try and fold it back up in order to return, but I will not purchase from this provider again."
3,Clear and wrinkly,I got this to protect my new walnut table top but still be able to see the table. I was happy with the quality of the tablecloth but since they fold it up in the package it comes out with very large seems/wrinkles that are very difficult to get rid of. If it were rolled instead of folded I probably would have given 5 stars but with the seems the light is reflected and you can't see the table underneath very well. If we pull it flat it is very clear...so if someone has the patience to get out all of the wrinkles (there were a lot) then it would probably be great. Not sure if any of the other options would be any better though.
1,Sorry I bought this vinyl tablecloth,"I bought this table cloth and at first was very happy with it and I reviewed it like that but after having it on my table for a couple of weeks, I noticed it was marked under the cloth and to my dismay with I lifted the vinyl table cloth, it had marked my beautiful table!!! I haven't been able to get the mark out of the wood where the Lazy susan was sitting on a mat on top of the plastic. Also there is another mark in another spot where nothing usually sits. They are large spots and I am very upset, don't ruin your table like I have mine, don't buy this vinyl cloth for your table."
5,Great product,I used this to protect my new table top from my cats when they would jump on it to keep them from scratching the wood. I laid it on top and cut a perfect circle leaving just a flat cover on top. It work out great. You can still see the top of the table but the cover protects it from scratches. It is just heavy enough not to move around and clings to the table and does not slip or slide. Worked out great for what I needed it for. Service was outstanding and received it the very next day.
3,Good tablecloth!,"I bought this tablecloth cover to protect my dining room table from the cats. They LOVE the table and the table cloth, but would always pull the cloth off. The covers done a great job at keeping the table cloth in place and protecting the woodwork. Product smells like a shower curtain when arrives, but airs out after a few days. Other than that, great product!"
4,Just as I expected.,"Good protection over an expensive tablecloth. Too shiny to stay on all the time, but easy to put on before dining."
2,Too thin,It's too thin and easily deforms under warm or large containers. The look and feel isn't that good either. I'll definitely prefer similar trickier clear plastic.
1,wrong size,"I ordered a 70'' round one, but got a 60''x90'' one instead. Contacted the seller but got no response."
2,plastic tablecloth review,I purchased this clear tablecloth to cover my new table. I wanted to protect the finish of the fine wood. My husband thinks the tablecloth makes the table look cheap. He won't let me use it. I am going to use nice place mats instead. The tablecloth is made well.
1,Poor Quality,Took it out of the package and seam was incorrectly sewn. Was coming apart. Not going to bother sending it back but won't purchase again.
3,Slippery,I like it well enough. It protects the table and is easy to clean. The only thing that I don't like is how it slips and slides over the top of the table.
3,it's not heat protective,"This table cloth looks nice. But if you put hot plates on it, it will become soft , there are imprint after cool down. Become not plat."
4,Nice,"This is a great table protector. My table is a classic farm table and has lots of grooves in it. I also have four young children who spill. This tablecloth has saved my table and saved me a lot of work. I wouldn't mind had it been a little thicker, though."
1,"folds, creases...unusable","i read the reviews prior to purchasing, so i thought i would be able to get out the folds it comes with. i tried everything! i first ironed the creases with a towel over the plastic. when that didnt work, i used a blow dryer. and when that didn't work, i threw it in the dryer. with the dryer, the original folding creases came out, but it wrinkled the plastic so much that it looked much worse. i can't have people over with a wrinkled tablecloth...so i am throwing it away! beware...i'm not a perfectionist, but i would never serve my guests with the wrinkled and creased tablecloth!"
4,clear round tablecloths,"Unless your table is 50 inch round or less these will be too small. These are exactly 60 inch round with no drop off. Otherwise, they are great for keeping wet stains off of good linens."
4,Protects my table.,I love this table cloth. We bought a very nice Amish table and wanted it to be protected from our 4 little ones. This does exactly what we need it to. Be sure to put a real cloth under the plastic so it doesn't sweat.
1,Accidental Order...,"How come i Can't get a return slip to return this package? Plus having to pay for the postage Twice?When can i see a return slip, so that i can send this back.. Everything is Too Big, to fit the stove pipes I ordered.."
3,UPS strikes again.,Was most likely a good product when it went into the box. Then UPS got their hands on it and I had to remove dents from all the metal parts and some of the insulation parts were damaged as well. Not the store owners fault but damaged during transit.
4,Thank God,"I was really worried that this new CD was going to be a let down. I wasnt the biggest fan of the last two (Scarlets Walk and The Beekeeper). This is the CD I've been wanting from her. Its kinda poppy.... meets vintage Tori.Out of the 23 tracks I only dislike 3 tracks. I'm very happy with the out come!I love the the catchy lyrics like ""Get off the cross. We need the wood.""Thank you Tori!"
4,"Her ""Blaring Balls Out"" Comeback from the Bombed out ""Beekeeper""","IF your one of Tori's more discerning fans such as myself...you agree that we dont love her any less,,,,we just expected a little more from her this past millenium than the tepid ""ehh-inducing"" Strange Little Girls and The Beekeeper. I almost gave up on her entirely.Move out the way for AMerican Girl Posse. Tori realized she was asleep and burst back on the scene with amp, balls AND YET kept the piano. Many of us love Tori for mainly one thing-- Her Passion. And here it is folks, wrapped up in angry guitars and cascading pianos.With its 5 interludes, this album most resembles the flow of ""Boys for Pele"".If you were worried before...fear not. Tori has finally returned."
3,"Oh, I just don't know.","You know. It ain't no Little Earthquakes. duh.I currently really like some of it... and I don't really _not_ like any of it -- tho some is getting vaguely ""easy listening"" for my tastes. Its kinda like most of her music is about pain and strange stories of her former life... and shes run out of it? I think perhaps, Miss Amos, needs to get on of those wigs on, and get out into the world, have experiences, not tours, and add more fuel to the fire."
5,Magnífico!,"Sou do Brasil e sempre compro essas precisosidades aqui na Amazon. Tori Amos é uma dessas pérolas raras. American Doll Posse + DVD já impressiona pela belíssima embalagem. Seu conteúdo é maravilhoso e expressa mais uma vez as personagens que a Tori pode incorporar em suas músicas. Um álbum que já fica pra posteridade. Vale a pena conferir, ouvir e guardar pra sempre."
2,Nothing too impressive here...,"I've been a diehard fan of Tori Amos since 1996. I have just about everything she has done. Before ADP was released there were songs that leaked onto the Internet and I listened to them and I was not impressed with what I was hearing. Today, I finally broke down and bought this album only because I wanted my collection to be complete. My opinion has not changed whatsoever. It's still rather bland and lifeless. There's a reviewer here who mentions that Tori needs to get back out and experience some life (besides touring) and I say AMEN to that! I'm extremely disappointed with this collection. I wish...oh how I wish I could say there are a few gems here in this set of songs but there really aren't. I like, like NOT love, one or two songs. That makes for a disappointing collection. Take off the wigs Tori and get real again. Please!"
2,A minor disappointment,"I've enjoyed the melody and the passion that I've been able to find in Tori Amos's past albums, but American Doll Posse fell short of that for me. The tracks are heavily political and subsequently they lose the raw emotion that I have always admired as her signature."
2,Long and Boring,"I'm a huge Tori fan, and I'm really disheartened to admit that her albums have been in slow decline. American Doll Posse was boring. I thought The Beekeeper was nothing special, and it took me many listens to get into Scarlet's Walks, which I ended up liking - not loving. I think the best thing she has released lately is her best-of albums. There are a few good songs on this recent album: Big Wheel, Bouncing Off Clouds, Digital Ghost."
4,some really good songs,"Just in the 4 or 5 times I've listened to this, I can already say this cd is better than anything since To Venus & Back. With more listens, it might go back to Choirgirl. There are at least 7 or 8 songs I love already. Of course, with most Tori music, some take more time to take the soul over. I'll come back in a couple of months to give a more accurate review. I love the mix of soft & hard on this cd."
1,Tori Amos/ American Doll Posse,I have followed Tori for 15 years now. I find this albumn depressing and preachy.
2,Tori Fatigue,"I have been a huge Tori fan since Little Earthquakes and own just about everything she has released. While I might not listen as often as when we had Tori lyric reciting contests, she is still among my faves.That said, American Doll Posse is practically unlistenable. Clouds Bouncing is great, and then there are 23 songs I can barely stand. It's sad. I also find the multiple photo thing and photo video a bit self indulgent. Dave Matthews, another of my faves, seems to have gone the same direction and it's tough.The release of a new Tori CD used to mean months of constant pleasure enjoying the new sounds. This is just grating.But hey, maybe it's just me. Seems like plenty of people still love it."
3,Not my favorite Tori album,"First of all, everyone has an opinion about Tori Amos's work. My wife loves this album. As for her post-Atlantic period, I personally liked The Beekeeper much better (once it grew on me), and Scarlet's Walk even better than that. This album definitely has many great moments, and I love the guitar and swagger here, but it has not managed to hook me even after many listens."
5,"An all-american greek pantheon of chic, and other cultural paradoxes","This album has hips, guitars, pianos and tap shoes. A highly recommended expansion of the 'sonic novel' paradigm.The special edition comes highly recommended. Check out the postcards and most importantly, the bonus tune."
3,I love Tori but,I love Tori but this is a move away from her more traditional sound. A valuable piece of her work but I find myself passing it over for her older stuff.
4,American Doll Posse - lovely schizophrenia,"I am a huge Tori fan. I was really looking forward to ADP after I heard the single, BIGWHEEL, and so bought it. I loved the concept that Tori had five separate personalities performing within the album, but that actually makes it feel kind of schizophrenic. I suspect that as I listen more, I'll like it more, since that's usually the case with her albums, but the fact that there are 23 tracks makes it a bit tougher to get to every song multiple times. But anyway, any Tori album is better than most others from anyone else."
5,One of Tori's best even though I'm only half way through the album..,"This album has to be one of Tori's masterpieces. I was a little concerned after the last album.. I enjoyed ""sweet the sting"" and other tracks but it was not a strong album.American Doll Posse is a totally different story. Every track is an instantly recognizable Tori track and yet nothing like what she has done before.The lyrics are brilliant and the music is so beautiful that it would open up the fan base for Tori to others who may have mislabelled her genre or just did not understand the beauty of it."
4,"Ok, let's calm down a little.","Im a huge fan of Tori Amos since BFP. I honestly think ADP is a good album, a huge step forward from The Beekeeper, but let's keep things in proportion, this album is not in the top 3 of Tori's catalog by any means.While ADP proves Amos to be in constant evolution it does not surpass in any category the genius of the best Tori album in the 2000's so far, Scarlet's Walk.Some people have created rankings positioning ADP in the top 3 of Tori's full catalog, I feel some justice has to be made in this regard.Best Tori Amos' albums so far1) Boys For Pele2) Little Earthquakes3) Scarlet's Walk4) From the Choirgirl Hotel5) To Venus and Back6) Under the Pink7) American Doll Posse8) The Beekeeper"
1,this doll posse needs to be run out of town.,"this cd just sucks, its even worse than the last. too long, too boring. who wants to lission to a song thats 1;39 seconds long? not me. I can understand why she is on a different label every cd. I dont think i want or will ever buy another tori cd agian. i gonna sell this as soons as i can. get 5 dollars for it, if i am lucky.The first 3 cd were so good, if not great, under the pink is my favorite. but this...it was a hard and painful thing to lission to, how sad, such a waste of such a gifted singer songwriter. better luck next time. this has to be one of the worst releses of the year....pretty good year, no tori, not for you. sorry."
2,Ho Hummmmmmmm,"I was a Tori fan from the git go, just so you know, BUT...Even from Little Earthquakes (an album soley devoted to aspects of sex, as all her recordings are (even Big Wheel spurts the acronym M I L F)) I found her derivative....and thus dismissable.She and fans like to compare her to every one in rock, but no one compares her to the ONE and ONLY true influence she has ever really had, the one whom she emulates with every note she sings...Kate Bush.Tori is a Kate Bush wannabe, and no one, not her, not her fans want to admit it, but she has been ever since she was a teenager, and that is an unarguable fact.Kate is the real deal. Tori is a boring wannabe in denial."
2,Not interesting. Too long!,This CD is just not that interesting. Goes along and doesn't bring me into it. Tori needs to really edit herself. That may be one reason why it's not that interesting.
5,What Fun...,"Simply put, this is a wonderful and fun album. As always Tori's music is a joy to listen to over and over and over......"
4,Nice album with a lot of songs !,"This new Tori album is nice, with a lot of songs, all so different and beautiful. It follows butterfly and it is in the same line.For the next one, I would like Tori to be more experimental, like for Choirgirl and Venus.You can buy this album, it's a great piece!"
2,Concerned,"While I very much agree with the need for treatment planning, I am concerned by this book that therapy is reduced to a checklist, mechanical approach. Relationship and relational variables are underrepresented. Or course, MCO's require this more specified approach, but books (and series) such as the ""Complete"" Treatment Planner reduce our professional work to an easier-than-it-really-is perspective, and as a result, devalue professional experience as well as client/patient contibutions and collaborations in psychotherapy. While I appreciate the author's attempts to simplify a rather complex undertaking, is is disturbing to see psychotherapy presented almost like auto mechanics. I understand that Jonqsma and Peterson fill a need but the format and construction of this book leave me wondering about the human side of the psychotherapy endeavor."
3,The Treatment Planner,The treatment planner provided basic information needed to assist with developing a psychotherapy treatment plan. I recommend this book to therapist needing a starting point for their treatment work.
3,Nice Overview,"For a coffee table-type book of less than 200 pages, this does provide a pretty good overview of the history, structure, and operations of major organized crime groups throughout the world and also offers a wonderful photo collection. Documentation is sparse, a few common legends are recirculated, and the sidebar on the Tommygun contains some inaccuracies but it's still a much better book than I expected."
4,Great classroom set!,"I love using this with my high school students. I lend out the Biology one to the Biology teacher, use snippets of the Physics one with my Physical Science students, and teach Atoms, Moles, and the Periodic Table with the Chem 1 video. We haven't gotten into the other two Chem videos yet.I think it's so corny it's well into the stupid-funny range, but my students like it. Be prepared to do a LOT of pausing, and I strongly recommend either finding an online study guide or watching and creating one before showing the video. It tends to move pretty fast. EXCELLENT for pre-test reviewing, or using small snippets to teach. I've seen better, but this is pretty darn good!"
2,not much cushion,"This was advertised as a great cushion but is far from it. The first thing I noticed is that it is very thin, and when you sit on it it feels very thin. It only added about 1/2 an hour to my ride before it felt like i was sitting on my stock seat. I ride a Kawasaki 900 vulcan and the seat is horrible. After reading the reviews on this seat I shelled out the money and purchased one.....more like wasted the money. Do yourself a favor and keep shopping."
4,Good Product,"Excellent Product...I loved the extra comfort. When it says to take it off when you are parked, take it off and place in your saddle bag. Went for a ride and stopped for only a short time. I did not take it off and I didn't even cover it. Got back on to go home and WOW....did I ever have a hot seat all the way home. It really did heat up in the sun. Sitting on the back seat, I have a problem getting on and off. I can no longer just slide on and off the seat. I have to actually pick up my butt. For a couple of inconviences, the comfort is worth it."
3,You put the crush on me,"Of the three albums Hiatt recorded for Geffen, this is the least interesting. The main culprit is Nashville producer Norbert Putnam, who used the kind of synth arrangements that carbon dated all the albums in the 80's that used them in an attempt to sound of the day. The highlights remain, as usual, the terrific songwriting. ""The Usual"" was covered by Bob Dylan, and ""When We Ran"" by Linda Ronstadt. Two other great compositions are here, the humorous ""She Said The Same Things To Me"" and the classic ""The Crush."" The ""American Elvis Costello"" tag finally comes with a payoff, as EC joins Hiatt on a soulful cover of the Spinners' ""Living A Little, Laughing A Little."" The overproduction here has often made me long for rerecorded versions of a few of the songs (I'd love to hear the title track or ""I Got a Gun"" stripped down). But as far as Hiatt albums go, ""Warming Up To The Ice Age"" is even less characteristic of the artist than the oft-slagged ""All Of A Sudden."""
1,Personality for Dummies,"If only it were so simple -- answer a few questions, connect the dots -- presto: so, THAT'S who I am! Ironically, if ""personalty"" was so easily calculated by the method created by this team of professionals, they'd be out of business. Nevertheless, for the self-investigators among us looking for the quick fix, it's this book -- or, for something even quicker, try the paragraph personality bytes under your astrological sign in the slick magazines..."
5,Best Character Reference Book Ever!,"Since reading the book, I am much more accepting and tolerant of myself and others and can readily understand why people do the things they do. I love to figure people out--this book has taken the guess work away and makes it simple to do. No one has ever defined my true nature like this book has done. In it, is a wealth of knowledge. I want to thank the author with all of my heart for helping me to understand myself and those around me like no other. I will use this book as a reference until the pages are pulp-free."
5,Best personality analysis book I have ever read,"I've read lots of these types of books and always find them interesting and useful to a degree. I found this one much more valuable for a few reasons.The best part is that you get a ""score"" on each of about 15 traits instead of 4 or 8. I also believe the concept that personality traits are the moderate forms of what can become personality disorders. Since so much research has gone into the disorders, it makes sense that they are a good set of measuring tools.I've leant the book to many people who have almost all found it very valuable. The sections on my strong types read like a biography, and the hints for overcoming limitations in life and relationships were specific and helpful.Pick it up and learn something about yourself and others."
5,Perfect companion to What Color is Your Parachute,"If you need to do life/career review, start with this book. Best personality evaluation I've seen. Based on solid science, not pop psycho-babble. Some career advice, but should be expanded"
5,This is a good guide to why our politics are dysfunctional,"If you want to understand what's going on in our strange political life and in the media, read this book. You will also develop a much deeper understanding of yourself and empathy for people you do not like or agree with. In fact it will help those who believe in the ethic of ""Love your neighbor"" and ""love your enemy"" to actually live these commandments. I have always known that I am made up of contradictory, even conflicting personalities. I've also always known that other people are not like me, and have their own reasons for acting the way they do. This book confirmed both beliefs."
5,Sinister Dane RULES!!!!!!!,"Move over Eddie and jimi, Jay Summers ain't no D. Baggerton guitarist. His shredding is totally rad to the max!!!!!!"
4,"An Excellent, Well Acted Movie!","This movie, set in WWII europe, was a very intense and yet emotionally moving story of the challenges of survival, leadership, love and respect-- all amid the seemingly endless pursuit by the Nazis and local citizen traitors. Daniel Craig's character was well acted, even though his yiddish accent was bit british, and eventually you don't see Craig, just his character. A definite good movie for Friday or Saturday night movie night."
4,Unusual war story,"This is a film about 3 brothers, Russian Jews during WW2 who take to the woods to evade the Germans, they end up absorbing several others as the group grows the problems begin and their is strife between the brothers. This is based on a true story and very well done with some strong performances turned in by the entire cast. I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys history, WW2 and and action."
5,Defiance,"AWESOME! One of the absolute best war flicks i've ever seen, and a true story to boot. I was riveted in my seat for 2+ hours! And i cried too. Go see this movie if you want to feel alive and learn something historical and worthwhile."
