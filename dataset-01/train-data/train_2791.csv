1,don't buy,Bought this thinking it was silver metal as it says and looks in the picture - it wasn't (actually copperlike in appearance). The Rubies are completely cloudy and poorly cut. It wasn't even worth the $8 dollars and I will not give this my girlfriend - it belongs in the trash. Don't buy.
5,We Almost Lost Detroit,"When I first read this book in the 1970's I felt it was something everyone should know. Now, with the latest disaster in Japan and our recent interest in nuclear power, I am convinced EVERYONE should have access to the information in this book. And let us not forget there is always a choice between fusion and fission power....Let us choose wisely."
3,Worth Reading...,"As someone that can see the steam towers of Fermi 2 from my driveway, I was very interested in this book. Although it is very outdated and quite biased, it did turn me on to some reactor accidents I hadn't heard of and gave me a little more history of the area I live in. The accident at Fermi 1 was actually pretty small and the plant still runs (actually visited it 5 years ago). A good place to start if you are interested in this kind of thing and the book sells pretty cheap so it is worth the small amount of money."
1,Pure GARBAGE!!,"I read this book years ago when it first came out since I lived in suburban Detroit.I am now a nuclear physicist and know that this book is GARBAGE. We came NO WHEREnear losing Detroit. A previous reviewer is just plain wrong to say that if alittle bit melts the rest is not far behind, and there goes Detroit. Nuclear reactorscan NOT explode; and Fermi 1 contained ALL radioactivity. Detroit was NEVER in anydanger."
5,Listening Hearts,"This book was recommended to our Discernment Group by our Diocese and it's a great tool to utilize. I've purchased more for use in Navajo Land for those who are ""thinking"" about Diaconate or those on the committees that need guidance of what to look for, questions to ask, etc. I highly recommend this to others who, like myself, are on Discernment Committees."
2,Easy to read... not much depth,This is a very lightweight book. I found much of it redundant and do not recommend purchasing it.
2,outdated,"The lonely planet london had some good walking tours, but for the most part, terribly out-dated in terms of prices for museums/attractions and also many stores/restaurants/internet spots have since closed. The maps are decent."
5,I was never the same afterward.,"I read this as a child, and it was one of three books that affected me the most out of all my excessive reading. (One of the others was Diane Duane's Deep Wizardry). It changed me with its beauty and poignancy."
4,Good book,"I like the setting of the story, like the way Cally is brought into umm...I cant remember if the world has a name, I dont think it does.I like the characters, not just Cally and West but everyone, especially the Lady Taranis, she seems kinda sexy in that dark way, hehe : P, my only problem is with Cally and West ( and other than this I like them ), what bothers me about them is that they dont seem really worried about the fact that they've just been dropped into this strange, new world. I mean if it were me I'd be freaking out.Perhaps I'd be running around in circles screaming my head off...but maybe its just me.Otherwise the book was one of the best I've ever read.So if your ever just sitting around flippin the channels or taking a trip or anything I think you really ought to try this book."
4,"outdated, but still relevant","the book took me back to 2002/2003. but much of the information is still very relevant. if you're forced to comply with security requirements, or best practices, and find yourself always asking ""why?"" ""why do we do this?"" and ""why is that a risk?"" this book will answer many of those questions. It also helped springboard my use of Perl, since until I read this book I hadn't seen a good reason to use it for Systems Administration."
2,Over rated.,"I'm surprised to see the rate of this book so high. I was expecting it to be much better and more updated. The tools that are used are not new, things that somebody in the security field knows and use for years. I was not happy also to realize that many pages include code listings of perl scripts.Maybe a nice book for somebody who is starting now in the field of security nothing new for the rest.Nicolas Krassas CISSP"
4,satisfied,"i bought this watch as a gift for my husband, and he absolutly loves it! Great watch for the money."
5,G-Shock Watch,"I gave this watch to my husband for a gift and he seems to really like it. The style is modern, yet classic and was exactly what we expected. Living in MI in the winter, has made the solar charging feature a little bit of a challenge, but since the sun has come out it more often, it charges a lot faster. He really enjoys the atomic clock feature (which performed well through the time change) and that the backlight comes on (blue) when tilted in the dark. Overall, he has been very happy with it and wears it everyday."
4,Casio atomic - solar watch,"The watch functions just the way it is supposed to - keeps great time and charges in the sun.I would prefer a smaller watch and one that has a larger lcd screen. When the hands of the clock are over the small screen, it can not be read and when they are not over that area, the display is very small. The body of the watch is very thick.Other than those two things, it is a fine watch."
5,Perfect watch.,This watch is like a Subaru..it's a smart purchase without prestige consideration.. just love the precision so I know if I am late for a meeting...
4,Another Collector amazed!,"My husband collects ""Christmas Carol"" versions and it is getting harder and harder to find him something new each year. After reading the review already posted, I figured, ""Why not?"" and gave it a try. We were so pleasantly surprised and completely entertained by the performance on this video. My husband says he is very proud to add this to his collection and feels it will certainly be one that is watched again...maybe even several times. It is a version we would highly recommend to the serious collector!"
4,Amazing,"Well, how come not 5 stars?Two reasons-the seat is poorly designed and the front handlebars are useless.If they had upgraded parts I would buy them.Beyond that, I couldn't be more pleased!It got here in RECORD time-undamaged except for a scratch on the handlebars. The packing/box is as described by others-Grossly Deficient.Here's the good part:Assembly? Super Easy!-Parts? Good Quality and all there! Bike Design-Slick!Quiet? AMAZINGLY QUIET! Smooth? VERY!You know, I can live without the front bars so call it 4 1/2stars, but the seat, I don't get. I am 6' and 210lbs and it needs to be contoured and re-designed since you are, after all, sitting on your ass all those hours.The seat is, for lack of a better word, primitive."
5,great bike!,"I purchased this bike because I have an arthritic condition and needed exercise that was easy on my joints. This bike works wonderfully without stress and strain on my joints. Because of its small footprint, it easily fits in the corner of the room. It is so quiet that I can watch TV while exercising. I love my new bike!"
5,Awesome!,"For my holistic practice, I read many books such as this. I conduct programs to help others find their true selves. In this easy-to-read book, I have found the best of all the other books. Ben has the ability to project an incredible amount of insight in an easy-to-understand language. No gobbledy-gook here -- straight-forward and personable with simple, thought-provoking questions to help you get at the heart of the matter. It is a definite must-read for my clients who are feeling an unrest in their lives and looking for their purpose. Thanks Ben!!!"
4,Chemistry: Connections to Our Changing World,"The book came in earlier than expected. However, the book was not near the description posted. It was said to be ""Like New,"" but the textbook was quite worn in the corners and binding."
2,Not a Sharp brand cartridge,"The one I got was not a Sharp brand cartridge. It was either refilled or a third party one; it did seen to work OK, though. Also, took about 3 weeks to get apparently due to a Jewish holiday."
1,Bad experience with this cartridge on an AL-1010,"I gave this cartridge a try in my Sharp AL-1010, hoping to reduce my cost per copy (I've used the AL110TD cartridge in the past, with good results). It was not a successful experiment. Control of toner output was problematic from the start, with dirty copies and frequent jams. Perhaps I received a bad unit, but I've never had a bum Sharp cartridge in many years of use, so I suspect that the claim of 'compatibility' with the AL-1010 is optimistic at best."
3,soft sell; superficial,"Having read the book and knowing some of the facts this is a very traditional writing of facts well known. Of course the Everly's are not ones to be very open, but better research could have been available. Years of abusenot even touched upon"
1,Episodes 60-80 NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE!!!,This is a bootleg edition of 20 episodes and no English Subtitles. I was lucky my seller was honest and respectful and did a fast even exchange. DO NOT BUY! I cant go Lower than 1 star or I would.
1,Weak -- Louis J Sheehan,Other videos cover these same points in much more detail and make the connections more clear. -- Louis J Sheehan
2,Mainly just another capitalizing wanabe,"This ""documentary"" is another one of the groups trying to capitalize on the success of Dan Brown's The Davinci Code. If any of these are serious about their topic I really hope they keep in mind that the book is in the fiction section. Though sometimes more has been made about the research Dan Brown has done then should be noted, the fact is it is a story even if there are some ideas derived from legend. Legends are generally not real either and many have nothing based in reality.Before you get all tied up into the cover-up conspiracy of the church you should watch and read about the historical evidence from real scholars. Do yourself a favour and watch The God Who Wasn't There"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CAPZBC/002-1128172-2217665) and then the whole DaVinci's Code will seem irrelevant.If you still love the whole DaVinci's Code mystery then there are other dvds that are better done."
2,"Starts Strong, Then Down Hill","Korsmeyer starts with a strong summary showing that the Catholic Church has both the willingness and the ability to address the existence of evolution in a way that is consonant with Christian doctrine. However, what he presents isn't it, relying on Whitehead's metaphysics and trendy environmentalism, like the ""Gaia"" hypothesis."
3,Ahh Memories,"I remember playing this game when I was a kid, and I'm glad I was able to find it again. My only gripes are that, on today's computers, the sky's colors seem to be disrupted on most maps (instead of the actual sky, there are a lot of rainbow colored textures), you cannot exit the game until you finish the mission (and if you decide to press N when it asks you to finish, good luck leaving the mission), and there is no way to exit the game in the menu, so when I was done playing, I had to bring up my task manager and close the game from there. But besides these issues, I really enjoy this game, and it brings back fun memories."
4,Good Game,"The graphics on the game are good. But your mostly just going over hills and grass. There is a multiplayer option, or you can do missons. You also get to promote the people on your Platoon for doing a good job."
1,Didn't like the lip,I returned this because I needed to hit the ball much harder to get it over the lip to get in into the cup to activate the return mechanism than I would have ever wanted to hit the ball in putting. Not a good habit to get into...
4,a real jewel,i read many books by this author and was very pleased to see all those essays almost impossible to find nowadays united in one book. I only had wished to have an intro about the story of these writings and a bio of Murphy
4,Eye opening,I very much enjoyed this book. I have had the opportunity to show the oontents of this book to severval friends in and from mainland China and all them were intrigued. We discussed the accuracy of it and it's plausibility. They thought it's accuracy was difficult to deny. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in studying the history of chinese characters and God's design. There are stories from cultures all around the world similiar to these. Could be an accident but it is difficult to imagine how so many accidents tell the same story. Good read!
4,One of the best things Anthony Michael has ever done!,"I haven't seen this movie in many years so I don't recall every nook and cranny of it. I just remember it being very suspenseful and I was on the edge-of-my seat watching it. As a child I didn't know who Siouxsie Sioux was but I'm now a huge fan!! In this world of so many crappy movies making it to DVD, why in the world is this excellent movie not available as of yet????"
4,Cool 80s flashback movie,"It is a VHS, so the quality is not great. It does not come in anything but VHS at this point. But this is a very 80s movie complete with a live performance from Siouxie, some cool clothes, underground L.A., and lots of action. Anthony Michael Hall is as good in this as he is in anything. I really enjoyed it then and still do, when I feel like reliving my 80's days. The soundtrack is great if you like more alternative/punk sounds of the 80s."
5,Great set of sockets,I bought the husky brand and was deeply disapointed that HomeDepot didn't have replacment or individual sockets available anymore. I looked at Sears and the quality isn't there anymore. The size is hard to read. This SK set has more sizes than the Husky or Kobalt brands. I can order any other sizes and accessories on Amazon. I have used SK tools years ago and these are far superior to the sets that I used to have. I am going to buy the larger sizes to complete my set.
4,Mixx a little Dream,There is so little to say other than the CD on a whole has been played on a radio station in my area and I have loved it since. amazon.com & WJZI in Milwaukee. Thank you. You have aided in making my life a little happier
2,colored copy paper,I was a little let down with this product. The paper quality was lacking and it would have been cheaper to buy colored copy paper and probably would have been better quality ( I double checked the labeling). I won't purchase again.
1,Riverside pastel paper,I was extremely disappointed when I opened this product. The pastel colors are washed out/drab and the paper quality is extremely poor. I regret this purchase and will never order this product again. Picture of product on Amazon looks far nicer than it is in reality.
1,No CC on my copy...,Being deaf I find it real frustrating when producers circumvent closed captioning laws... other than that I am sure it is a good video... or so they told me.
5,THIS IS MAJOR LEAGUE FUN!,"Okay, I already wrote a review for this game but stuipidly put it to the wrong program, and put it in, ASPYRA media, which I played it on EIDIOS, I just love EIDIOS....Okay, well, the graphics are great, for the second, but wait till you play all the others! WOW! It is fun, to go to all the places, and it is true if you miss doing something in the other level, your out of luck and have to reload your other game and try again! Whats the fun in that! The one thing I didn't like about the game, was that Lara's furniture was 20 times bigger then her! Her bath tub was a swimming pool! That was just, why? Okay, the story line is great, and this game can give you some spooks! THings popping up outa no where! WOW! When you get to the dragon's oh that is fun! And the yetis, and the big snowman! SCARY stuff! I just recommend this to anyone, who likes role playing games, it's just plain old good fun!"
3,"Lightweight, but not great with crampons on a long hike","These shoes have given me great support on hikes. They were fairly easy to break in, compared to other boots that have a shank large and solid enough to take crampons. I love their light weight. They also have a wide toe box, which is a big plus for me.But they tore my feet up when I clipped crampons onto them. The leather in the back was not sturdy enough, and the back wire of the crampon pressed through the boot against my ankle. If you plan to use them with crampons, you should probably either use the strap-on kind, or plan to wear them with the crampons enough to break them in (or at least, to build a callous on your ankle) before you climb with them.The only other downside is the color..."
4,A Realistic Look at Aspergers Syndrome,"This novel is a realistic look Aspergers syndrome from the point of view of a teenager with the behavioral disorder. It is easy to identify with the characters even in their most unlikable moments. There is no happy ending, but I found myself celebrating Christopher's accomplishments and sympathizing with his family even when they were at their worst."
2,It didn't quite feel authentic,"I am fascinated by autism. People with autism think differently than most people, and I am very intrigued about the precise differences in thought patterns. This book, unfortunately, just didn't grab me. There was something about it that seemed too methodical, trying to get inside the head of an autistic boy but not authentically grasping his feelings and world view.I much preferred the non-fiction accounts I have read from people with autism. Those interested should check out Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant by Daniel Tammett and Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's by John Elder Robison."
1,The Last Silk Dress,"The description on the back of the book said this was a story about a girl who was using silk dresses to make a balloon. However, the story was more about illegitimate children and affairs."
1,Talented author but...,"I think Ann Rinaldi is a very talented author but I am from the South and these kind of books offend me a lot. I am proud of where I come from and what my Confederate ancestors fought for because they weren't fighting for slavery or adultery, they were fighting for economical reasons. They don't teach you this in school. I think this book is telling kids my age to be ashamed of their Southern heritage and that offends me."
2,Not too too great,"I am one of the most prolific readers that you'll ever come across, and an avid reader of historical fiction. I've read and liked some of Ann rinaldi's work, but this book is a bit too bland. Great for historical detail, don't get me wrong but the book is a bit dry and a bit of a ""candy"" novel if you catch my drift. Doesn't exactly stick in your mind for very long. I'd recommmend this book to people a few years younger than me, though, because I liked her books when I was younger. Also a great way to introduce kids into this genre, but for teens it's not so great if you're looking for depth."
5,One of Rinaldi's greatest!,"I have read about every book Ann Rinaldi's written (excluding those published in 1999) and this is definitly my favorite. I love the way the story was constructed and the how it gives a sense of how the war impacted teens. I've read the book several times, it captivates me with every single read. It also helped me to realize how the state of Virginia has been such an important part of the US's history and makes me proud that I grew up in Northern Virginia. Read this book, you'll love it!"
4,Incredible,"This book was incredible. Susan was a strong spirited and willful girl, I could not put this book down. I gave it four stars because it took me awhile to get into the story, but after I kept reading it I fell in love with it. I even took this book to the beach with me and spent most of the time reading it."
5,~Best book I've read!~,"I haven't read a good book like this in a long time! It was great. I think that if you like this book you also might like any other books about slavery, or the Civil War. If you have a million books to choose from, this is the best! I gaurntee it!"
3,If your a civil war nut this is the book for you.,"This book is very captivating. It dipicts a life of a girl (Susan) who is willing to do anything she can for her country. Her mother is another story and is full of nonsense. I think she was hurting though and takes all her problems out on her daughter, who she physical and emotional hurts. My friends were making fun of the cover though and saying it was a Preteen Romance novel, I had to laugh though. Like they say you cant judge a book by its cover. The cover is very deceiving theres not a lot of romance which is good and there is a ton of history in it too. The biblography is loaded with stuff Rinaldi researched just to write this book to keep it somewhat accurate. I really enjoyed it and I hope others will be inspired to read it too."
5,You have got to read this story!,When I got this book as a gift I couldn't believe it. Who would want to read a story about the Civil War? But after I read it I had to read it again! It is full of great historicial facts but it shows how families have to stay together no matter what is going on. This is one of my favorite books and the best book by Ann Rinaldi that I have ever read! Check this book out! :o)
5,The Last Silk Dress,"The Last Silk Dress is one of the books that will keep you hooked until the end! It is really sad but one of the best books I have read in my life! Its about a girl named Susan who lives in the South during the Civil War. She is desperate to help for ""the cause"" but her mother wont allow her. She has an older brother named Lucien who left home over a quarral with his father. Susan does not know him but meets him out on the street while venturing out in boys clothing. Susan knows that her mother does not like Lucien but meets behind her mothers back anyway. This is a story of one girls adventure through life which I know many of you people out there will enjoy! This is a MUST read!"
5,Great!,"Susan Chilmark is a 14 year old girl living during the Civil War. Her father adores her, but her mother hates her and whips her whenever she can. On a chance accounter with her older, estranged brother, she learns more about the war and ""the cause"" that she believes in furvently. After that she begins to slowly change. She spends a ton of time with her brother, she ignores her mother and she learns about family secrets that should have been kept hidden, because they affect her most of all, out of all the people in her family.Ilove this book, especially the parts with the Union Soldier Timothy, because I love romance. I also liked the parts with her older brother, because it reminded me of how my brother and i get along."
4,A well-written novel with a great story line!!!,"I thought that this novel was a wonderfully written story with a great story. Though it's ""happy ending"", which is so common with books, lost it one star, it is still a great book and I enjoyed reading up!"
4,Excellent,"I've read 2 other book's of Ann Rinaldi, and this is the best one yet! It was so well written. I felt like i was right there. the only problem i had was the end. i didn't think it was the best way to end this book. If you like Ann's books thisone is one of the best to read!!"
5,Great Book! =),"wow, this is a very cool book. but i really want to know what happened after susan arrived at the new house with Tim's family and stuff..hope Ann will write another book about it. =)"
4,Good book but not the best,"The Last Silk Dress was my 2nd Ann Rinaldi book and the pattern is obvious in all her stories: a 14 yr old girl with a distorted family goes off to find her identity and finds some guy in the mean time. While it was a good read, it wasn't as great as the Fifth of March. Where Rachel had good solid reasons for taking a stand against the people she loved, Susan seemed silly and impudent to keep going against her brother Lucien who has done so much for her just to commit a childish act of rebellion against the South by setting the silk dress balloon free. She seemed rude and ungrateful at times and the ending didn't tie up all the loose ends, The story seems to end right after the climax much like the Fifth of March, but atleast the Fifth of March provided a likeable and reasonable heroine."
5,It was one of my favorites of hers.,It was a very interessting book. I enjoyed it thourghly. I enjoy reading books about the past. It provides a lot of useful info. I liked it alot!
5,You really feel a part of the story. It's great.,Once I picked up this book I struggled to put it down. It is a wonderful story. I feel as if I am in the story and feel the same emotians as Sarah. I like the historical part to it. It adds alot of flavour. You know that there is partially a true side to the story. This book is suitable for all ages. If you haven't read it and you like historical novels this is definatly a great book for you! Enjoy reading it.
3,"A Special, not an Espisode","Wow, this particular special has not aged very well. That said, it's still a fun video, but don't expect Sesame Street-style precision transitions or Electric Company-type literacy teaching. I described it to my 6-year old son as being sort of a midpoint between The Muppet Show and the Electric Company. Slightly educational, but mostly entertaining. I would recommend tracking down actual episodes...where? I don't know."
5,You should be ashamed if you've not yet read this book,"A friend of mine forced this book upon me, which was not a difficult task being as I've enjoyed some of his other work. Wait, enjoyed doesn't cover it. Everett's writing makes me glad that I'm literate. It makes me remember what kept me reading with a flashlight way past my bedtime. I enjoyed every moment of this book, and laughed aloud quite often. Normally I'm uneasy about a book with the main character being a writer....but ""Erasure"" is brilliance. I bought 3 copies as gifts so far. This is a book that is worth your time. Cancel your plans, sit on your couch, and read this book. You have no reason not to, and every reason you should.And if you can get your paws on ""For Her Dark Skin,"" by the same author, do so. It's my favourite book ever, and being an English major and bookworm, I've read a lot of books..."
5,Thoroughly original and wickedly ironic satire,"Percival Everett has written a brilliant response to the publishing industry's ""ghettoization"" of black writers in America, a book so sharp and biting that it will have any intelligent reader laughing uncontrollably. Remember ""Hollywood Shuffle"", Robert Townsend's send-up of Tinsel Town's ghettoization of black actors/actresses? Well, this book does much the same thing to the publishing business, except that Everett wields a rapier with a velvet glove. Not to be missed; superb in every way."
5,Intimidating and wonderful!,"I've recommended this book to about 10 people since finishing it about a week ago. This writer blew my mind and I cannot wait to read his previous titles. Nails the black lit scene to the wall, makes you laugh out loud and throws in enough obscure references to send you running back to college textbooks. A wonderful book from top to bottom."
5,very good book,the book is very good i want to read over and over again and i like how they put pictures in the middle of the book and they talk about their child hood but they talk to much about the break up but not the future and what they have accomplished as a group with out the other members but i would recomend this book
5,U all jealous haters!,"I read this book and thought wow!... I dont understand how a couple of people on here are dissin the whole thing,using posh language to sound good and imoprtant! 4 that sad act who said that Destinys Child havn't actually survived n e thing, ur totally wrong!... Do u know them personally and know what they have been through???um no! This book is only a minute part of their life ,just stop hatin!Beyonce as the writer of destinys child is writing the lyrics for THE FANS mostly and part of their personal experience is written down too. Beyonce is the most insperational artist around and to say that she just wants to be in the lime light and jus promote herself is wrong. Most of the artists around now have written a book, so why does every1 pick on beyonce,,,i know, ur all jealous!Only destinys childs true fans will understand what im talkin bout, 4 all the fans that aint bought the book,go and buy it its well worth the money![]"
3,Soul Survivors,More of a Fan book. Great book for he Fan of Destiny's Child.Charming! but not too much depth here.
3,Excellent intro to Diesel Engines for auto mechanics.,"This book is an excellent intro to Diesel engines, suitable for students of auto-mechanics, and do-it -yourselfers. It begins from basics, and goes all the way to the new electronic-controlled diesels. It shows systems from the major manufacturers, and includes small block designs. One drawback is the lack of color photos, but there are diagrams on every page. The book is worth its price."
4,"Simple, yet indepth","This has been one of the best books I've read on diesel engines. I'm not sure if it is a textbook, but is detailed like a textbook, but easy to understand. It doesn't deal much with the new diesel controls, but is a very good basic diesel book. I would recommend it as a first read for anyone wanting to learn more about the basics of the diesel engine."
1,Wrong Equation,"Take care : Referring to chapter 2 "" Diesel basics"" under the title ""Compression ratio""; page 9 It is written : Compression ratio = Swept volume + clearance volume/Swept volume. The correct equation is : Compression ratio = Swept volume + Clearance volume/Clearance volume ."
2,Big Bore,A rehash of the last three decades of self-help. Only wort reading if youve never read an stress self-help book before.
5,Norelco HQ5 Reflex Action Replacement Heads,"These heads do what the original heads did. Close and comfortable shave, am very satisfied with them."
5,Perfect shaving head blade replacements for my older Norelco shaver,"The local shaver shop wanted 50 bucks to replace my heads. Found this on Amazon and ordered. Perfect fit, easy to install and I saved half of what I would have paid at the shaver shop. Recommended for those with older Norelco shavers that work fine but have gotten dull."
1,Bought two -- both died on me,"This hair dryer did dry my hair quickly. BUT, it quit working after a month. I exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later.The buttons were also hard to switch. This was a waste of money. I ended up buying a completely different hair dryer."
1,Poor quality,"After some research online, I decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities I was looking for in a lightweight, compact model. It worked great while it lasted, but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it. One day it worked, and the next day it started smoking and sparking!!"
2,Careful of this one!,"Like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck! If your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product, it is a struggle to flip the switches. I don't know if the ionic feature did anything or not. I suppose I'll know once I compare it to the replacement I'm about to buy.I had the dryer for about a year...and now it's gone. As I was drying my hair last week I noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle! Yikes. I cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped. It lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead. No smoke, no fires, just nothing. I expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this. Back to Target I go..."
3,it was okay,"I finished the book last night, really didn't care for it. A few of the stories involved rape and torture. Others were just very unrealistic. Overall it was okay, I enjoyed parts."
4,its like GUYS GONE WILD!!!,"My #1 pick this summer! Truly fun anthology about sex in college frathouses. Great cover, great selection. I think my favorite is Davem Verne's ""Tucker the Spy"". Brought back some delightful memories. College isn't nearly as fun if you're not spying on your peers."
1,NOT A GOOD DESCRIPTION,Bought this for a friend and didn't know it was for MAC only....very poor description!!NOT a happy camper.
2,The Lost Bible - Forgotten Scriptures Revealed - J. R. Porter,"This book was recommended by a scholarly gentleman which should have sent up a red flag. I subsequently read numerous reviews which confirmed the basic fact that this is a ""scholarly"" book with lots of detail, in-depth explanations and art work. An excellent publication but really not what I had in mind. I bought it anyway using a precious gift voucher.My mistake. It's more than I want and I lost interest as I got drowned in detail. I reiterate, it's an excellent publication but make sure it's what you want. I am donating my copy to my church and am back to hunting down a publication of books that did not make it to the Bible along with simple explanations in modern day English. In other words, something similar to the Parallel Bible."
4,autobiography of Cal Ripken Jr.,"I believe that Cal Ripken Jr. was one of the greatest baseball players to ever play the game. I think that the novel, ""Cal Ripken, Jr. My Story"" by Cal Ripken Jr. and Mike Bryan, gives a great idea of the hardwork that Cal Ripken Jr. put in to become a Major League Baseball player. This novel was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone. I thought the book was great because the book gave a very realistic view of how hard it is to make to the Major league. Plus it showed how dedicated Cal was. He spent many years in the minors before he finally made it to the majors. Plus I also like how the book didn't concentrate on Cal's baseball career. They talked about his childhood and how their father, who was coach of the Orioles at one point, wasn't around most of the time. Overall the book gave a great biography of Cal Ripken Jr. and that is why I think the book is good."
1,Im Glad This S.O.B. retired,"What did he Do nothing, he played like a million consecutive games without being out.....SO they need to have books out on Barry Bonds but they make up excuses about he is on steroids and he's just the greatest at least to me, HEY YO ya boy Cal is Garbage, Im glad he stop playin because he wasnt doing anything that caught my eye but get old!!!!!!"
4,Naughty but informative,"The unexpurgated lyrics to many familiar sea shanties. Just whatyou'd expect from sailors, (or 14 year old schoolboys). But thereal highlight of the book is the explanation of the jargon used, origins,and history of the songs. Also, some nice illusrtations. For the scholar and neophyte alike."
5,Fantastic!,"Probably the best troubadour/trouvere disc that I've heard. Stirring vocal work and authentic instrumentation invoke the spirit of the 12th & 13th centuries perfectly. Includes a great rendition of King Richard's 'Prison Song', as well as 'Redit etas aurea', a song that I've read the text of before (the lyrics are great-very representative of the 12th century mindset) but never heard performed. I didn't know that any notation of it had survived. Definitely recommended for fans of early music, but so well done that anyone looking for something new and interesting to listen to would probably enjoy it."
3,Watch performs as expected - terrible wrist band design,"The plastic wrist band connects under the face of the watch. It creates two very noticeable protruding lips underneath the face of the watch where your wrist comes in contact. If the watch is snuggly fitted on the wrist, one will notice that the lips dig right into your wrist. Replacement of the band is very difficult. The screws connecting the band to the watch are impossible to remove. Terrible band design."
4,Good watch for those who do not require any other fancy functions.,very stable. anti-shock. sufficient power supply with regular out door wearing.
1,Would never connect atomically,"I work in NYC and live on Long Island and the watch would never connect. The whole point of th watch was that it did that, but it never did. I returned right away."
2,Not near as Good as Advertised,"I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries. There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me. I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function. This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch! It has become very unpredictable. Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments. But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about. I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase."
4,Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch,This watch is great except the light flashes on whenever it feels like it. The watch is a little heavier than I thought it would be but it is attractive and well worth the price I paid for it.
4,Useful Book,"The service paradigm is spreading to all areas of computing, including telecom, finance, and energy. Technology now takes a back seat to business solutions especially where the latter are packaged as distributed services. This book provides an authoritative account of the historical context and current best practices in the emerging field of SOA. Its content has depth as well as short sharp practical guidelines for the implementation of real world systems. Recommended."
3,Useful at an architectural level but not at a development level,"May be I was expecting too much out of this book, it provides good categorization of different types of services and the roadmap - however I feel it lacks some details on the technical implementation part as to what tools/technologies/standards are ideal to implement this architecture.Again, may be my expectation was not realistic."
4,"Good, but becoming dated","This is a good overview. It is slowly becoming slightly dated since its examples often refer to specific technologies, so only 4 stars."
2,"Scattered, Out-of-Date,",The authors attempt an ambitious goal of covering many SOA topics - but their resulting text come across as scattered - vague - and lacking a coherent and practical application.Thomas Erl's books are much better written - and have a coherent approch to buliding a solid body of knowledge.For a manager / salesperson wanting a broad overview of SOA - they might be better served by reading Service Oriented Architecture For DummiesService Oriented Architecture For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))
4,Talking about SOAs - End to End,"A lot of books about IT concepts just touch on technology. This book goes at least one step further. It does not only explain, what a SOA is and how you should/could implement a SOA, it also gives real world advice how to introduce it to and deploy it in large enterprises. A step which is often negelected and underestimated. Good reading."
1,Hypothesis Proved,"Wading through this mucky swamp of hatred and bias leads me to believe even more in the theory that ignorance does breed hatred, and hatred in turn is the foundation for a form of ignorance that has not been seen since the Germans were convinced that slaughtering Jews was done in the best interest of the German people. But more importantly, only the most disrespectful Americans would even dare to blaim such a monumental event and indeed the hatred that many Muslims feel towards the United States on any person; much less one of the most respected statesmen of all time."
1,Terrible political mush,"This book is pure political mush. Yes, Clinton never killed Osama bin Laden, but the one time he sent missiles into Afghanistan, what did the right wing Republicans do? Did they cheer him on? Did they tell him to go full force and send troops? Noooo. They said he was trying to cover up for the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton's priorities were in the right place, and the Republicans were completely wrong. Maybe if Bill Clinton didn't have to deal with the hypocritical Republicans and their attempts to kick him out of office for a private affair, then he could have taken care of business without criticism. Shame on the Republicans."
2,Ever heard of a Bibliography???,I am a historian and someone who blows off this much steam without tons of sources is just ranting.So ends the lesson.
1,Can we say radical,"Ok, arguably, Clinton had some role in creating September 11th by not preventing it. However, i feel this book is simply radical conservatism at its worst. It makes me ashamed to say I'm a conservative."
4,A book of medieval martial arts,"This a very scholarly book; well reseached, and of very high quality in printing; indispensable to anybody who want to have a comprehensive idea of the martial arts of medieval Europe. The only thing I'd suggest to the publisher is to include a CD with demonstration of the techniques presented in the book."
4,band,nice watch for 75$ thick but getting used to it band is way to large but shorting it is east i removed 3 links there are arrows on inside of band pointing to opening to remove spring type pins gave it 4 because nothing in manual are web about band wonder how many have been returned cause of it ?
4,Too Thick,"They should show another angle to give you an idea just how thick this puppy really is [3/4""]. Otherwise, it was a good deal @ $75 a few weeks ago."
4,"Excellent watch,..but poor lighting","Excellent watch,..but poor light effect.. Itis not an LCD based light but just two small LEDs on the sidesAll other features are brilliant.."
3,Nice features. Thick and bling,"I wanted to replace my other Casio Atomic watch (band broke) and this was on sale. I like the features, but the pictures make the gold hour accents look muted, but the real thing...they are really shiney. It looks very pimp-ish. The watch is very loud and flashy. It is also thick, but if you've seen the G-Shock watches, they're all thick. If you like spinning rims and grillz, this is the watch for you."
5,Dr. Engel provides excellent entertainment and information,"I have this lecture on CD (I guess the DVD version simply shows him lecturing). A superb lecturer, this one on the Brontes is one of his best. He has a light and natural delivery, and infuses his lectures with wit and interesting tidbits. I also recommend his lectures on Charles Dickens (his specialty; indeed, years ago he started a group known as the Dickens Diciples) and Mark Twain. If nothing else, go to his website (authorsink) and purchase the CD version."
2,Shades Of Black: Crime and Mystery Stories By Afrrican,This book is very bland I put it down after the first 3 short stories
2,A Long-winded Advertisement,"I was really excited about this book when I first learned of its publication. Upon reading it, however, I felt cheated and betrayed. It really is a 240-page advertisement for Miss Vera's Finishing School, which sounds like a groovy place to drop a few thousand bucks for playing dress-up. When will someone write a book that appeals to the CD community, scholars, and the general public? Enough feather boas, give us a knockout package without insulting us, alienating others, or over-generalizing motivations for crossdressing."
3,Cross-Dressing is soooooo CUTE!!!!!!,"As the not-yet ex-wife of a very decent cross-dressing guy, I wanted to throw Miss Vera across the room. High camp aimed at titillating straight people who want to de-demonize transvestites, I suppose it's harmless. But the woman writing the book, supposedly representative of biological born-women women, seems to be promoting the idea of women as Barbie and transvestite men as wanting to be Barbie. Since one of the most objectionable things I find in my husband's desire to dress female is that he has a kind of Theme Park, Disneyfied idea of women, I am particularly repelled to find a woman reinforcing this stereotype. My parents, however, found the book comforting and reassuring. Go figure. Maybe because by characterizing the behavior as cute it Miss Vera makes it seem less frightening and alien. It is funny and beautifully laid-out, as one would only hope for such a handling of the topic."
3,"Fun read, but don't expect to learn anything.","It is fun to read, it is interesting. But as far as explaining anything about how to dress femme, you won't learn from it.When I first picked up the book at a glbt store, I was excited and could not wait to read it. About 1/2 way thru the book, I felt stupid for having paid $15 for it.I give it 3 stars cause like I said - it was entertaining. BUT, at the time, I was looking to learn to dress, not be entertained by some advertisement for a school that one weekend costs more than I make in a month. This book is like the movie dumb and dumber, it is entertaining, but really stupid otherwise."
2,"Tons of features, horrible reliability","I bought this laptop since it had tons of features for a very low price. However, it's been nothing but trouble. The keyboard never worked right (lots of dropped keystrokes) so I sent it back and got another unit. That one also had the keyboard problem and had a line of bad pixels down the center of the screen.Additionally, the software the comes with it for managing power settings and profiles is terrible, the speakers are nearly unusable for watching a movie (distortion and low volume), and the included battery started to show drasticly lower life after about a year.I've had a lot of Dells and while they're not perfect, I'd buy one of them or a MacBook instead at this point."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this toy would be more durable. Although my grandson liked it, I don't see it holding up for very long."
3,bought it for a gift,"I personally would not buy anything like this. However, my nephew LOVES to play with these different action figures. I have purchased several for him and continues to play with them at age 10."
5,Great book!,I have this book on my night table and enjoy reading it every evening. What a pity it won't be any more books by Nader!
2,Sad story with no hope.,"The acting is fine. The story is depressing, the Father is portrayed as a war hawk who uses his influence to obtain a military commission for his myopic son(the boy is considered blind without glasses). The boy is killed in combat, the father confesses to have sent his son to oblivion, how sad, for what....personal or worse national pride. Ends with a reading of a sad poem written by the father. The only bright spot is in the character of Jack. Foul language is used readily by soldiers in training and more so in combat scenes. The soldiers are quick to use the name of Christ Jesus the Christian God in vain and Kipling the father uses Allah the God of Islam with reverence, this is rather odd and is need of more research, film doesn't develop this aspect."
4,War ww1,If you like history you will like this good ww1film let you know watt when the first ww started ...
5,Compelling as Both a Personal Story and Allegory of the British Entry into the First World War,"The personal story of the loss of Rudyard Kipling's son and the effect on his family moved me most the first time I viewed this movie. The performances are emotional and well-done. Since then, I have watched the movie several more times and find it to also be an excellent allegory of the innocence of a nation entering a war that they were not initially prepared for, militarily or intellectually. Highly recommended."
3,Decent for the money,"Variable grind and a decent size bean hopper, looks nice. But it is EXTREMELY loud compared to other similar grinders, even from Cuisinart. Don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation in the same room when it's grinding, and expect to wake the whole house up if you dont grind the beans the night before."
3,coffee mill,"The price was a bargain, but I miss my trouble free cuisinart coffee grinder. This burr mill is great, but you need to be cautious about two items, one, the darn coffee comes out loaded with static electricity so it sticks to the plastic receptacle where the ground coffee sits, and two, the French Roast coffee I use must be oily, because after several weeks this mill literally craps out without warning, no motor, nothing; in this case, Cuisinart does not tell you, but you need to peek at the output spout of the mill where it shoots the ground coffee, take a screwdriver and sort of pry the jammed coffee grounds out of the spout, then the mill works like before. I have a feeling most people faced with the latter situation, just give up and trash the mill. Again, I think if I ever get tired of my mill, I'll go back to my trusty coffee grinder."
3,"So far, so good.",It puts out a decent consistent grind. The bin should probably be made from a stronger material the coffee coming out of the mill sandblasts the inside of the bin making it harder to keep clean. The motor is a piece of crap that is extremely noisy and puts out a lot of radio interference. I wonder how long the burrs are going to last as they appear to be made from some kind of plastic.
1,Reconditioned for a reason,"Don't buy it. Design won't hold up to rigor of daily use. Used for three months, and now broken. They have reconditioned product for a resason this is a POS."
1,Broke after less than 3 months,We'd been using this burr grinder for less than 3 months when the top piece broke off. The bean hopper piece feeds the beans down a tube to the burr grinder. This tube is what snapped in half on ours.
5,Cuisinart Burr Mill,I bought a reconditioned burr grinder and it works great. I like to dial in the amount I want and let it do the work. It's convenient to simply fill the hopper and just push the button. The downside if it has one is that it is noisy. But I am used to this since all grinders are noisy. Just leave the fresh ground coffee in the container till you need it. Its small enough to push to the side and out of the way of your counter space. Very easy to use.
4,Good Grind - Short Lifespan,"This is my second purchase of this reconditioned Cuisinart grinder. The first one lasted about a year before it stopped working, but still worth the cost. Mine gets a workout on a variety of grind settings and the grind is always excellent. I also like the large bean hopper size."
3,It works,I have had my unit a few days now. It is really is no better at grinding coffee than a cheaper style that beats the beans with a blade like a blender's. One thing I do like about it - it grinds just the right amount beans tomake six cups of coffee (I have not adjusted the number of cups needed yet) This is a big plus as I dont haveto fiddle with measuring beans in the early morning!
2,As noisy as a power saw with bad bearings...,"This grinder does grind the beans reasonably well. And the presets for coarseness and quantity function OK...worth 2 stars.But, the device is SO loud that you will either need to leave the room...or...you can do what I do & use the following ear protection:Milwaukee 49-17-3300 Heavy Duty Folding Ear Muffs, NRR 28 db. The plastic hopper also does tend to build up a static charge, preventing some of the grounds from pouring out...a scoop can be used, though.Also, I recommend ordering this separate from other items, because Amazon's packers frequently do not adequately isolate multiple items [I had ordered peanut butter that had broken open and leaked all over and got into my grinder...although I do not think the oil spill caused the loudness."
2,Want to break up your marriage?,"OK, it was really inexpensive, and ground coffee OK, but the noise level was unacceptable, and I'm a guy who works all day with woodworking machinery! My usually-unflappable wife was approaching the ""it goes or I do"" point when I pulled the plug (figuratively, too!) and gave it away, along with a pair of ear plugs. Domestic tranquility ensued.WARNING!!! You would definitely NOT want to run this machine with a hangover."
2,Bad product,i tried to grind coffee in this grinder it grinded for two seconds and stopped working as if it lost power I tried everything but nothing worked so I returned it and with no hassels got my money back
2,"Good promise, but he fails to deliver.","Being a fan of Chad Wackermans' work with Frank Zappa, I bought this album expecting displays of fantastic technique, imense talent and cool tunes. However, it seems that Chad didn't want to go down the same route that many other soloists do i.e an album of tricks, and instead he plays it way too safe. No particular track, except for the title track, grabbed my attention. The production on the whole is good, but that's about all."
5,Another great Bob Barner book,"I picked up this book for almost three year old daughter because we loved Bob Barner's Fish Wish. My daughter learned so much about the ocean from that book and I thought Dem Bones would give her an introduction to the body. The book follows an old African folk song called Dem Bones. ""The ankle bone is conneced to the foot bone, the foot bone is connected to the leg bone"" and so on. Since my daughter is so young I just sing the song to her and point out the bones on her body as we see the corresponding ones on the skeletons in the book. If you have an older child there is much more in depth information about the bones provided on each page. That is why I love Bob barner's books so much. My daughter can follow along the simple to read stories now and when she gets older I can go over the more informative parts with her later. She has already learned a great deal from this book and she really loves it. Bob Barner really makes learning fun."
2,Okay for intermediate speakers,"I bought this book on the mistaken impression that it was the complement to ""The Everything German Book."" In fact, the practice book is not structured at all like the ""Everything German Book."" In fact, you will need a basic grasp of German grammar to use this book.Although as a practice book it is okay, I feel it relies to heavily on ""find the mistake"" exercises. I would rather not see grammatical mistakes in print as it reinforces the mistakes in your brain.Do not be fooled by the similar titles. ""The Everything German Practice Book"" is not related to the ""Everything German Book."" At best, it could serve as a followup text."
4,Ricky Nelson Sings,Good Record with biographical material. Those of us who remember the Ozzie and Hariet show take a walk down Memory Lane.
5,As Good As It Gets,"If you are old enough to remember Ozzie and Harriet, you will love this DVD. If you are too young to remember it, You will still love it. It is music at it's best. If you were a Rick Nelson fan, This is as good as it gets. If you weren't, You will be after watching this DVD. Great moments from the show, all the songs you've always wanted that were never before available. There are wonderful, candid interviews with all his children, and a musical session with James Burton that is fantastic and very touching. I can't watch it enough. No family has ever produced more talent-- three generations of it. It is worth every cent you will pay."
4,Ricky Nelson Sings (DVD),"this is a must own for every ricky nelson fan! the videos cover most of his tv career from the very first song he performed, ""i'm walkin'"" in 1957 to ""fools rush in"" in 1963. interviews with his children as well as his guitarist james burton and singer kris kristofferson interestingly and informatively connect the 23 performances. the bonus material is all very worthwhile especially a performance of ""garden party"" by rick's sons and james burton. the only negatives--there are many more songs that could have been included (with fewer interviews) and a couple of burton's great guitar solos were either cut short or eliminated entirely. Hopefully, a volume 2 of ricky sings will soon be made available."
5,Great DVD,"Great memories of the 1950's and 1960's. The reproduction of very old television shows was perfect. Picture clarity and sound was excellent - a tribute to the engineers who produced the DVD. All his greatest songs with a few ""others"" thrown in and the input from hiis children, James Burton and Kris Kristoffensen also added to the viewing pleasure."
4,Ricky Sings and it is great,"Fantastic DVD released 20 years after Rick's tragic death. I enjoyed it immensely, particularly the interviews with James Burton and Rick's children. A very neat review of an American original.I rated it 4 of 5 stars because I would have liked a little more depth on Rick's band and his development as an artist."
4,A Trip Back In Time,"There is nothing glossy and overproduced about this video, it is more like a home video with family reminiscences, a gentle reminder of who Rick Nelson was and what he meant to his children. Consisting mostly of black-and-white film selections from the old Ozzie and Harriet TV show, with commentary by his children, this is not a hyped-up biography of a star who died too young but a calm, too-brief look at his emergence from child actor to 'Teenage Idol'. This is nostalgia and nothing but if you grew up in those more innocent days. Watching it I lost 50 years, taken back in time. I found myself humming and singing along, remembering all the songs as if I were still a young teenager. The film clips seem dated and stagey now but it doesn't matter when you hear Ricky sing again. If you're looking for an in-depth bio of the singer Ricky Nelson you won't get it here. This 60-minute video is a sweet, low-key tribute from his family to a beloved dad."
1,Disappointed,"I love Ricky Nelson and the info about him & the interviews were great. However, on every song he sang, the sound was distorted."
4,MEMORIES - -,"A GREAT TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE - GREAT SEEING ALL RICK'S KIDS, TOO. I DIDN'T KNOW SAM WAS A GREAT TALENT, ALSO."
5,Lynn a Ricky fan from New Zealand,"The songs were Ricky's early hits in black and white but great as they were - living in New Zealand I never saw Ricky on teley only pictures of him on the record covers. I appreciated learning about Ricky's beginings his family his parents and his children. To see the young James Burton perform with Ricky and the featurette James Burton perform with the sons of Ricky surely is a treasure.This DVD a must for any Ricky fan along with his DVD ""ROCKING WITH RICK AND FATS""."
1,scratching a bit on the surface,"39 of the 111 pages consist of full page printed sketches, wich are beautiful. But the text, which is very rare in this book, is sometimes missing, and throughout this book very superficially. Thomas C. Wang describes one (1) pencil technique, which he is using for his sketchings, other methodes are not discussed or even mentioned. I could not recommend this book to anyone, perhaps for very beginning artist, whom are uncertainly in leading a pencil, but even then there are better books."
4,Good deck booster!,"These cards are only good if you have a good deck already and just want to add some force to it. This deck helped me add some Dragon cards and have cards to give me extra strategy's. Like cards to summon dragons ( like the Gods,Blue Eyes,Red Eyes) of course it does not come with the gods but the gods are worth [...] So if you have a deck thats good (like mine) and you want to be the Champion at your school (also like me) then I suggest to add some of these cards to your deck."
3,A GOOD DECK BUT COULD BE BETTER......,"HI, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A HONEST DRAGONS ROAR REVIEW I'M THE GUY FOR YOU. I GOT THIS DECK A FEW DAYS AGO AND ITS OKAY,BUT I,M NO TOO THRILLED ABOUT IT. IT LACKS ANY STRATEGY EXCEPT THE SUMMONING OF RED EYES DARKNESS, AN LV7.ARMED DRAGON. THIS ISN'T FOR ROOKIES! MAINLY BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE CARDS TO MAKE IT WORTHWHIILE. BUT IF YOU REALLY NEED A DRAGON DECK AND HAVE GOOD COMBOS THEN THE DECK IS GOOD FOR YOU,OTHERWISE DO NOT WALK RUN AWAY!!! IF YOUR A BEGGIINER I SUGGEST YOU GET ZOMIE MADNESS DECKS."
4,Dragon's roar,"This deck is pretty good if you can get a lot of the cards on the Dueling Guide.I do have every structure deck.I've got cards like 'Armed dragon LV7','Horus the black flame dragon LV8',etc.Just try to get as much power cards as you can!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,"This deck is great; red eyes darkness is really nice looking also, but if you're looking for your first deck, then i would recommend zombie madness...moving on!!Just add a dragon treasure, blue eyes, and a monster reborn and your deck will be much better than it was before...if you need more firepower added to your deck i suggest a blue eyes or possibly a tri horned dragon of you're going for a dragon deck, but if you're not, a cosmo queen will sit just fine. i was also thinking about getting zombie madness but i decided on this because i already have two blue eyes to strengthen it, plus the red eyes darkness dragon looks nicer than vampire genesis :P"
3,A GOOD DECK BUT COULD BE BETTER......,"HI, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A HONEST DRAGONS ROAR REVIEW I'M THE GUY FOR YOU. I GOT THIS DECK AFEW DAYS AGO AND ITS OKAY,BUT I,M NO TOO THRILLED ABOUT IT. IT LACKS ANY STRATEGY EXCEPT THE SUMMONING OF RED EYES DARKNESS, AN LV7.ARMED DRAGON. THIS ISN'T FOR ROOKIES! MAINLY BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE CARDS TO MAKE IT WORTHWHIILE. BUT IF YOU REALLY NEED A DRAGON DECK AND HAVE GOOD COMBOS THEN THE DECK IS GOOD FOR YOU,OTHERWISE DO NOT WALK RUN AWAY!!!(...)"
5,A MUST-HAVE DECK :P!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't have much to say except THIS DECK ROCKS :p!!!!!!!! There. I think I made my point :p!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS: If you don't know wether to get this or Zombie Madness, get this (even if you're a beginner):p."
4,No substitute for experience,"Many people may think that these decks are chock-full of great cards, that is true. Many people also know that many rares are now displayed as ""non-foil"", that is true as well. Most of the people who purchase this deck are new to the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game and want a strong deck without working for it, and this seems the way out. It's not. While these decks do have many good cards, you still need a lot of possible srategies you can use with this deck. For instance, somebody with a regular Yugi Starter Deck (no changes made) could easily defeat an inexperienced duelist with this one. I only reccomend this deck to players that already know how to play and make a good deck."
3,Good Genealogy,"Good book for genealogists. Great history book of the east Tennessee area and as Ms Bush said in the introduction, ""She probably will remind you of someone you already know and love.""Is Ms Florence COPE Bush still alive? If so can she get in touch with me. My 4th great paternal grandmother was a COPE. janicemc@dishmail dot net."
5,A Dream Dance Fantacy!,This truely brings the soul inside out and makes it want to dance the night away! This semi Titanic remix by Blue Nature will blow your mind away once the sonic vibrations of their music touch you. They have a cool compilation with them on it!
5,Fantastic,"This song is excellent. Has a great beat to it, and I like the transitions between dance mix to song and back."
4,Great slice of life memoir,Lots of details from the vividly remembered life of an east coast Jewish American family at the turn of the century. I'm sorry I don't have my copy any more.
1,Ionizer aggravation,"Works so-so at best. After awhile, it started popping, too. Cost way too much for such mediocre performance. Would not buy, again."
4,Old Fashioned never gets old,"This is a beautiful assortment of old time gospel songs performed by terrific country singers.I would have chosen a different tune than Elvis's ""Crying in the Chapel"" and I would have liked another Johnny Cash song instead. I love Patsy Cline's 'Just a Closer Walk"" and Loretta Lynn's ""In the Sweet by and by"" . There is not a bad song on this CD. It puts my mind at ease and brings me closer to God whenever I listen to it."
4,Country Gospel,"For those who enjoy the old time style of gospel music, this is the CD for you. Lots of great music to listen, enjoy and sing along."
2,i liked the villain - the rest of the book not so much,"The Lion's Daughter offers an annoying tomboyish heroine who misunderstands everything, messes up everyone's plans, and causes more trouble than she's worth, a dandy/rake of a hero who has a nice sense of humor but very little character, and more plot twists than the author can handle. It's convoluted, messy, and not that interesting. I read this after the second book in the series, Captives in the Night, and the only reason I don't regret reading The Lion's Daughter is because it provides a background for Ismal, the hero of Captives and the villain in this book. In the latter, his back story was kind of taken for granted and only obliquely alluded to, and I felt there were some gaps in his character as a result. They were happily filled in here, but that's the only saving grace of The Lion's Daughter."
4,A great read,"I looked for this book forever. I was just about to pay top dollar for an old issue- thanks Berkely! This book was great, it really had too many characters with too many motivations to follow but I absolutly loved the interaction between the family members. I enjoyed learning all about Esmond (see Captives of the Night - the best book she has ever written)"
2,Slow start.,"Never finished. And that is saying a lot because I always plow through the slowest of stories to at least find out what happens in the end, but for this one, I didn't care what happened, so I never plowed through."
1,No stars!,"This book was absolutely hoRrid!This definitely goes to show that what others have rated highly here, may not be universally liked.Esme is a petulant, annoying, whiny, griping SHREW! I felt sad for the hero to be shackled to her.And where was the romance ? Thankfully I borrowed this from the library."
1,Simply a waste of money,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I rarely post reviews of products, but this one is so bad, I had to. I have been playing golf for 17 years. I currently play about 2 rounds per week, and practice at least one other day. In other words - I take golf pretty seriously. I recognized that my putting was suffering and sought out this DVD. I was really amazed and just how bad this DVD was. Basically all Dave Stockton says is that you need to forward press with your hands and you need to find your ""signature stroke"". That's it. I just saved you from buying this DVD. I passed it around to a couple of my other golfing buddies and they were also amazed. I emailed Dave Stockton through his website and expressed my disappointment. They offered to refund my money. I like Dave Stockton - he is indeed a good instructor, but this video was nothing other than something to put his name on and make some money. Absolutely the worst instructional material (book or video) I have EVER seen."
4,Reprint This Book,"I was ""forced"" to get this book online without paying for it because no economical alternative exists. I completely disagree with the people on here who don't want this book reprinted because they think that the world would soon become saturated with card-slingers, thus taking away some of the glory of being the only guy in town who can chuck an Ace of Spades through the Washington Post. Please keep in mind that like ALL hobbies that require:a) reading a bookb) lots of practice and dedication...means that 99% of the population will buy the book, skim through it and put it on the shelf next to their dusty diet, magic coin trick and gardening books.Even if his fellow slingers & magicians busted his ballz for releasing trade-secrets, Jay should definitely reprint this book so 1% of people who read the book and follow through with it will keep the art alive."
5,Good techniques,"I am a semi-pro card thrower in the national card throwing league (ctl), and I have to say that this book is the bible of card throwing. The techniques I have learned from Jay's book have helped me a lot. I was struggling on the tour last year when I got to talk with the famous Bill 'the Hand' Strongtide who recommended I read this book and it has really helped my form this past year."
4,Beautiful bowl but make sure you notice dimensions!,"Make sure you note that this bowl's diameter is 9"". Under product dimensions the diameter is written as 11.5 x 11.5. That stuck in my head. Not sure why this differs from the mentioned 9"". So, when the bowl arrived, altho' quite nice, it was smaller than I expected; this bowl wouldn't be big enough for my family to share...I'd eat it all myself!"
3,For severe consumers only.,"This was a great thing for me to buy when I did, because at that time Niun Niggung hadn't been released yet, and so these songs were not familiar to me. But now it's kind of a waste of money unless you kind of need to own everything by Mouse on Mars to feel secure in your position in the world of elitist music world. I know I do. It's a compensation for my poor eyesight and lack of any decent muscles."
5,This is the Bible of Composting,Do not waste your time reading other books on the subject. This has it all and is an enjoyable read as well.
3,mixed feelings,"I absolutely LOVE this lamp. It's gorgeous and reminds me of ""lily of the valley"" flowers. However it is difficult to assemble the delicate paper lanterns without poking a hole through them. You have to stretch it quite a ways before the metal frame can come into place. Also I bought this lamp in February 2011 and it's already dead. Sad faces."
4,Yummy bisque,"Excellent lobster flavor, not strong ""fishy"". I was wanting larger chunck of lobster rather than tiny minced pieces, but then the price would have been beyond my pocketbook. I do strongly recomend..delicious !!"
3,airflow attachement,"I love this hair dryer except for the fact that the concentrated airflow attachement is faulty. The little prongs that attach it to the dryer itself are very thin and brittle. They break very easliy and now my attachement just rests on the dryer...one false move and it falls right off. I cannot seem to find any place to order a replacemnt part. Other than the faulty attachement, I have had no trouble with my hair dryer."
3,Don't plan on using attachment for long,"The things I like about this hair dryer are the convenient speed and heat switches (it has 3 settings available for each) and the size. It is shorter than majority of the hair dryers, which makes it easier to use on the short hair. Also the bigger nozzle delivers more air flow, speeding up the drying process.So why only 3 starts? First of all, it does not deliver on the ""quiet"" part and is as noisy as all my previous hair dryers. Second, the concentrator attachment, which is a vital accessory for styling, does not stay in place and falls off easily. After falling several times on the bathroom floor, it cracked and the ring that is supposed to connect it to the nozzle, fell apart piece by piece, making the attachment useless.Also it seems to have the same problem as many other hair dryers: after less than a year of use the ""hot"" setting became too hot and now I'm down to ""warm or nothing""."
1,Beware!,"Despite the name, this is actually performed on a harpsichord (not a clavichord--apparently a bad translation), and an exceedingly ugly one at that. If you can get over the unpleasantness of the instrument, then there is, at least, the satisfaction of hearing a minor and deservedly unknown repertoire."
4,Runestone,I started reading this at the hospital. They had a copy of it. I wanted to be able to finish it. Not too a book.
3,Pretty basic stuff that fills the time,"I was expecting more from this book given the high ratings. The author does a decent job keeping the pace going, but I really did not start caring much about our heros. Plus, our main bad guy, ""Master"", does not have much invested in what he is doing either, which makes it hard to really dislike him too much. I found the ending somewhat hard to believe, and one of our bad guys seems to make some caprious and unlikely decisions, which I think are meant as ""plot twists"", but really come across more as ""I wonder why that would happen"". A ""fluffy"" book, which is not what I'm looking for with a Special Forces read."
1,Re-do plot lines,"I enjoyed reading Mr. Mayer's Green Beret series. So I bought his other series only to realize that he re-uses plot twists. Same scene, different players. It is like reading the books I have already read... Again.No thank you."
5,a must read for romance readers,i loved this book! i have just recently started reading historical romances and this book was great! i've never read a spanish romance before and i loved this one! i challenge you all to surrender your reading time to this desirable book.
1,"Wrong Item, Pay for return shipping,","Ordered a Stainless Steel Watch, Received a Gold colored Watch. Paid about $9.00 to return the Gold watch.A week later I was informed that the watch that I ordered was not in stock. End of story! Is that a good way to do business??Ray McLaughlin"
1,Extremly Narrow beware!,"I was pretty excited to get these shoes, I typically buy Rockport's and Cole's. Much to my disappointment these shoes were so narrow I couldn't even fit my foot into the shoe. I honestly believe a human with a 13 foot that would of had such a narrow foot doesn't exist they are more like ski's then a shoes. If you wear E's as I do know you have no chance of getting your foot into these shoes, in fact I doubt a D could.The workmanship seems awesome, on level with a Gucci (to my untrained eye), though I have no idea about the wear ability of the shoe."
3,Liked the other two more - some filthy content,"We really enjoyed (parts of) the previous Deer Hunters. They are hilariously stupid, some parts just plain stupid. The guys in the family enjoy them more than the girls, for sure.My problem with this Deer Hunter was the filthy content. I was not comfortable letting my kids watch it. It wasn't ""clean fun"" like the other two. I am also very surprised, as Jeff Foxworthy is such an outspoken Christian. You would not know that if this video was your only example of his comedy."
5,Easy to build projects teach the basics.,"I found this book very helpful. If you enjoy looking at woodworking magazines, but lack the skills to tackle those complicated projects, then this is a good book for you. The mysteries of roof angles, gates, which screws and bolts to use is explained in this simple book. Everybody with a backyard needs to look at the simple shelves and benches that can built using easily found supplies. Just a fun book to look at."
1,Maddin: way overrated,I tried to watch this movie last night. I guess I didn't read the description too close because much to my dismay this is some kind of ballet treatment of Dracula. I cannot stand ballet! I think it's a terrible idea. As soon as lucy started dancing I was outa there! I am not impressed with Maddin's movies or shorts. He is high on visuals(that aren't that good) and low on any story/character development. I think he's incapable of making a good movie.I recommend seeing Coppola's Dracula or the Hammer ones instead.
4,"Very good ""minor"" Murnau film","If you are looking for a haunted house-type horror film, this isn't one of them. Its instead a murder-mystery: a murder has occurred a few years ago, several people are now assembled within a castle, most of them assume a certain one of them committed the murder. One of the group disappears, a shot rings out.....While not on par with Murnau's more well-known films, such as Nosferatu, Faust, or The Last Laugh, this one is still worth watching. The restoration is excellent with only a few scratches here and there, and as always, Kino has done a superb job in the transfer. The special features are minimal, consisting of some passages from the original novel and a few photos of set design paintings.If you are building a collection of Murnau films or German expressionism films (this barely qualifies as one), then you need to have a copy of this."
2,For Murnau completists,"Pretty disappointing for a Murnau. I didn't expect horror, I figured if there was a creepy, horroresque Murnau film literally about a haunted castle, we'd have heard more about it long ago. What you get instead is a pretty tepid mystery/morality play that's a cinch to figure out, and not particularly atmospheric or very interesting. Even the crime at hand happened before the film begins. It's great to see any silent film from a notable director like Murnau made readily available and in such appreciable form, but were it not a Murnau film, I doubt it would be getting much, if any attention today."
1,Only 55 Minutes & Awful Picture Quality; Wait For The Kino,"I purchased this due to Amazon's statement that this Haunted Castle is 90 minutes long. That's incorrect, it's only 55. There are currently collector's copies in circulation with a much better picture that run 72 minutes. Kino is scheduled to release a restored 80 minute version in March, I strongly suggest waiting.The only reason I bought this was due to Amazon's statement of the 90 minute run time; don't let it happen to you!I consider the picture quality of Haunted Castle unwatchable, even by Alpha's low standards & Wolf Blood is only slightly better."
1,Politics as Usual,I didn't think they sounded very much like the people they were impersonating and it wasn't very funny either. I would not buy it again. Save your money.
4,"Epicurean Recipes, Easy Directions","A surprise-package of superior recipes, using fresh regional ingredients. Even in a land-locked city, these recipes work. Frequently, a simple twist - imagined by a seasoned chef - lofts standard foods to mouth-watering levels. Once discovered, this book will be treasured."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!,I read this book as a child in school my teacher had this book i read it and cried through it....i have since had a daughter of my own and have bought the book for her it is truely a sad book but with a good meaning....i would 100% recommended this book!!!!
3,Easy to Use but Overpriced,"I purchased this software thinking that my daughter would be entertained for hours, however, she went through each disc (Transition Math & Reading Readiness) within 1 hour each. It's kid-user friendly but there's not enough learning material in it...ALSO, a few of their exercises are duplicates from their books, which is a disappointment. Also, I wasn't really pleased with the Letter Recognition exercises, they aren't really helpful. I wouldn't pay $19.99 for this software, and to be honest, I didn't! I got it in auction elsewhere for much cheaper, thank goodness! I'm going to continue to look for better education products."
2,Great until it broke after 3 years,I loved this hair dryer up until a few weeks ago when it started to shut itself off in the middle of drying my hair. It's good that Amazon is no longer selling this model.
3,Disappointing Gothic Tale,"This is a beautifully written book. In many ways Brontean. However, the ultimate ""secret"" of the book was rather disappointing and altogether obvious, and the writer took oh so long to get to the rather tame conclusion, although she did it with great evocative power. As a literary work on the roles played by women at the dawn of the last century, it speaks quite clearly on the repression of women's creativity and subservience to the male establishment. However, for genuine storytelling in this genre, read the truly repressed women who were writing in the Victorian Age--the Brontes, Mrs. Henry Wood, George Eliot, et al."
5,WWII there and in America,"Unlike the readers who couldn't identify with this superb novel, I found itenlightening and right on target regarding theme and purpose. Three women: Frankie,the radio gal from London; Iris, the postmistress in Franklin, MASS; and Emma, the pregnant wife who waits for her husband who went to the war because he lost a patient are all believable and real. The plot concerns Frankie's letter never delivered when she sees the sorrow of the waiting widow; Iris' concealing the letter from Will Hitch because she wants to spare Emma; Emma herself who already finally after a month realizes her husband was killed. The parts that are slightly unreal include Iris' boyfriend's death, Harry who watches for German subs. Totally engrossing and beautifully written novel about the War in Europe before America awakened to it with Pearl Harbor. Engrossing and lyrical."
2,Disappointed,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon. I read Kate Morton's books, House at Riverton and Forgotten Garden, and was looking for something similar. I read these reviews and thought that ""Grange House"" would be perfect. Ghosts, an Inn on the Maine Coast, 1896...How could it go wrong? Well, it's tedious. The conversations between the characters are exhausting. I found myself constantly rereading phrases to see if there was some kind of double meaning....some information I was going to need to solve the mystery of ""the story"", which solved pretty quickly. I hoped there would be a twist and I would be wrong. In the end I felt let down. I've never written an Amazon Review before but I found these reviews to be unbalanced and that this book received too many rave reviews. I will probably read the author's next book, The Postmistress. Again, the plot sounds great. I am keeping my fingers crossed."
2,Disappointing,"The problem with this book for me is that I want to love it. I picked it up and was so bored by it, that I put it down again for a couple of months. Now I'm trying to get through it, just for the sake of having finished it. I want to love it because I love the ""idea"" of the story, but the execution of it is disappointing. The wordy, stilted, language detracts from the story. Another reader mentioned something about the novel's ""turgid melodrama."" I couldn't agree more. I also want to like the characters, but find them to be two dimensional, colorless and overwrought. Unless you're like me, who has to try to finish every book I start, skip this one altogether and reread du Maurier's REBECCA instead."
4,Sarah Blake Knows Her Stuff But ..............,I found Grange House a little bit difficult to get into and a little overly descriptive. There is a good story under it all.
4,Taut Victorian Thriller,"Maisie Thomas, a seventeen-year-old girl coming of age in the late part of the nineteenth century, has returned to Grange House, the Maine hotel she has visited with her well-heeled parents every summer of her life. Standing at the brow of the boat, she eagerly looks up to the attic window to see if her old friend, Miss Grange, is waiting for her.So begins Grange House, a wonderful Victorian mystery by Sarah Blake. But little does Miss Thomas know that this summer is to be different - Miss Grange has a task in mind for Maisie, desiring Maisie to finish the tale of the house that she had started so long ago. To do so, Maisie will need to explore her history and the history of the history of the people and places of the surrounding area. Along the way, she discovers the true meaning of love and family."
4,"A spooky, romantic, well-studied Victorian tale","I initially picked this book up because it was written by the wife of one of my professors. However, I was happy to find that it was very skillfully written and researched. Also, it is a fascinating, sometimes spooky, sometimes heart-wrenching, and sometimes romantic tale of families, ghosts (of the mental and chain-clanking kind), growing up, and love. Be warned: there are a lot of names and information in this book, and some of them are little tidbits that sort of dwindle into nothing as the book goes on. And some are brought up randomly so you have to leaf back to find the connection. But overall, a great read."
1,"Disorganized, don't bother","Too many things get glossed over, nothing is very detailed. There are all of ten pages covering how to install a boiler, and half of those are useless photos. Most of the photos and diagrams have nothing to do with what is being talked about in the surrounding pages, and when they are somewhat relevant, there is virtually nothing said about them. The book feels like someone was throwing stuff together to meet a page quota. I bought a bunch of Taunton's ""For Pros By Pros"" books which were great, very detailed, but written so that the average person new to the material could understand. Unfortunately, they don't have a book on HVAC that I could find, so I bought this one. I was very disappointed and am I currently seeking a new book to get me started on the basics of HVAC."
4,Back to A.O.R!!,"The last three releases with Ten has been a disappointment for most of their fans. Even though I think ""B.A.B.Y.L.O.N"" has it's moments my interest in the band has been nothing at all the last years, sadly I must say.I read about this one in a magazine giving it a poor review but you know what? I don't think he ever heard the record, because this is nothing more or less Ten back in action with that great AOR-vibe the first two albums had. If you're into Tens early period, Dares ""Out of the silence"" or just great melodic rock you should look this one up! It's great, welcome back Gary Hughes!"
3,"Nice bag, but needs more pockets inside","This is a nice, heavy purse and feels like high quality. But, inside there are almost no pockets, so it is kind of a black hole for things to get lost in. The exterior looks nice, but I would not buy it again."
4,Decent cheap water stone,"this is a nice starter stone for someone who wants to learn how to use a Japanese water stone. it polishes knives very nicely, and if you know how to use a water stone then it works very well for sharpening and polishing knives."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I first bought this phone and used it and charged it. The battery life lasted 1 day and then tanked. I didn't use the phone for calls and it was on standby. I had Virgin mobile replace that phone. The second phone I charged and used it. The battery life lasted 5 days on standby. I didn't use the phone for calls. I tried calling virgin mobile to try to replace this phone, but a rude lady got very nasty with me. I stated that the phone was suppose to have standby time of 7 days (BTW, the website says 9 days standby time). She stated that the phone had standby time of 5-7 days. Then I said that the phone battery only lasted 5 days and this was unacceptable. She then stated that she charges her cell phone everyday and that 5 days was acceptable. She then stated that since I didn't use the phone at all 5 days standby time was good. Horrible service. Don't buy this phone, it looks nice, but the battery life is horrible. This phone is garbage."
2,Turn off screensaver to help battery life..,"When I called VM on the issue of less than 24hr battery life, I was told to tun off the screen saver. Why it matters when the phone is always closed, I don't know... but it does help some. Good luck to those with a Marbl phone. I was aslo told that the Oystr has the same problem. This was from VM customer support. Other than that, they didn't offer any solutions. I also read somewhere in another review that this phone uses more battery when searching for signal even when closed in standby, wasting more battery. So turning it off when not in use is your best bet!"
2,Battery life ruins the phone,"The phone has nice features, of which multiple alarm settings and a decent speakerphone are my favorites. The battery life will leave you cursing, as this thing will die on you when you least can afford it."
1,Oh so plasticky,"I had this phone one day and returned it immediately. (I have no comments on battery life because I didn't have it long enough!) You are not even getting what you paid for at $29.99. The phone looks cool in pictures but it is all very basic HDPE-ish plastic. It is unbelivably flimsy. Nothing durable or cool about it as soon as you hold it or pick it up. It's also fairly large, further betraying the appearance."
3,Major Problem is Battery Life,"The one, overriding major problem is the battery life, as pointed out by just everybody who commented. I called Virgin to get a replacement but they don't just sent you a new battery (which is the smart and cheap thing to do) but instead sent an old? phone and battery (not in box, so I assumed it was used). The battery is the same one used in the K10 phone but in this phone, it lasted (I timed it 3 times) 16-18 hours on standby only, I made maybe 1 or 2 text messages and no actually phone call. Yes, that's pathetic. So, I returned the ""new"" battery since it was just as bad and instead of having Virgin send me another useless battery again, I just used the one I got. I charge the phone almost everyday now. Aside from that, I love the size, the style, the lack of too many extra features (which I don't need). But I got it for $20, so for that price, I'll give this phone a passing grade or else it would fail with the battery life and useless support from Virgin."
1,Garbage - and would you still like a 286 processor,"This was my first foray into the wireless phone market. It almost ended my experience prior to beginning. The phone is too...ooo..ooo slow. So, for us beginners who need to find the screens to figure things out ... there is no patience left. Bootup ... SLOW... I ended up buying a used Kyocera Cyclops. Yeah. Now I am in the world of wireless phones. Recently I purchased a Slash as a gift. That is once again quite a step up from the Cyclops. There is no need to put up with junk like the Marbl."
1,"Phone Ok, Battery & Virgin Cust Service stink","Battery doesn't last 24 hours w/o charge. phone works, we just use it to make calls, no games, music or other extras, but the battery just drives me bonkers. and replacement batteries cost more than the phone. Virgins customer service is astoudingly bad. the website is so desperate to look hip and with it, that it is nearly unnavigatable. Calling them 4 different times has resulted in 2 positive contacts with helpful reps, 1 transfer,hold,transfer,hold,disconnect and 1 total stoner ""dude"" that hung up after listening to the problem.Giving up and getting a differnt phone"
1,Battery kills this phone,"I love Virgin's pricing and gladly canceled my Cingular/AT&T account when it was due for renewal. I opted for the Marbl based on what I thought were complete reviews. Somehow I missed the many, many complaints about battery life. It is awful. The phone will not stay charged for more than 24 hours, even when it's not in use. Other than that it's a nice, basic phone. But I can't live with that short a battery life so I'll use up my minutes and toss the phone. I'll switch to another carrier because I won't be wasting money on a Kyocera phone again."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this blu-ray player the day they came out and ended up having to switch it out three times to get one that worked. The first one had a bad drive motor, the second a loose component connector and the third worked but still locked up frequently. The picture quality is only slightly better than many of the ""upconversion"" dvd players on the market. One reviewer stated that Underworld Evolution and T2 are stunning. While I will admit Underworld looks good, although the regular dvd is not that far behind it in picture quality, T2 has a DTS sound glitch that makes it skip on this player and overall the picture is not much better that the ultimate version out for half the price on regular dvd. The discs at this point are not worth the money, poor transfers overall and few or no special features. Save your money."
3,"Not bad, still needs improvement!","Overall this blu-ray player has performed above average. It does still need a little work in the video quality as I know some blu-ray disks should look somewhat better than it looks on this Samsung. Hopefully, their upcoming second generation player will take care of these issues. Also no advanced audio codecs are supported."
1,Doesn't play some disks,"I bought this in February 2007. I just tried to play Pirates of the Caribbean on it and it doesn't work. Talk about a big disappointment. How can Samsung sell players that don't play disks 3 months later? Apparently easily since it has happened 4 times for me in 2007 alone.November 2007 comes around and (repeating what happened over the summer with some movies) the BD-P1000 won't play other movies, Live Free or Die Hard for me.The problems with the Samsung BD-P1000 are too many to list, but Samsung needs to ask themselves: why do they need 3 (or was it 4 or 5?) firmware updates in a 9 month old product? I can do them, but if my mother or cousin had the player, they'd be returning it as defective.Tell me, how hard is it to have a player that will play a movie? I've had DVD players for years and NEVER have had to update the firmware to play movies. My next player won't be a Samsung."
3,"This player is capable, where's the software?","I've had more so-so experiences that good ones with the BD-P1000, but the good ones suggest that the problems are more with the software than the BD-P1000.Most of the first blu-ray releases have been better than regular DVDs but not up to HD standards. However, when playing blu-ray discs like Terminator and Terminator 2 I get a picture that tells me that, with the write software, the BD-P1000 can provide a picture comparable to HD-DVD.If there was better software and a lower price I would rate the BD-P1000 four stars. I could not give it five stars becuase I think the Toshiba HD-A1 does a much better job upscaling standard definition (SD) DVDs and even if the BD-P1000 meets the HD-A1 in HD material it will still fall behind the HD-A1 with SD DVDs."
5,The best DVD player ever! Go Blu!,"Over the years, I have had many DVD players. They ranged from the least expensive DVD-VHS combination models, to high-priced Denon players. One thing is clear, the picture quality on this Blu-Ray out shines them all. I use this player with an LCD monitor (Dell) and the combination is nothing less than stunning. I would highly recommend the BD-P1000 to anyone who desires quality DVD viewing at a reasonable price.I compared it to a few higher-priced Blu-Ray and HD-DVD models and in the end the Samsung BD-P1000 was a clear winner."
1,Blur-Ay or what,"I saw this player in store and now I am getting Toshiba (which is sold out everywhere, btw).I was initially in ""Blu-ray camp"" because the name is cool and whatnot, but seeing this kind of debut gets me worried.Maybe BR will win as re-writable, computer media, but as movie DVD successor I doubt it would. With its 0.1mm protection layer (compared to 0.6mm on HD-DVD) I just can't see how this media is going to be adopted by rental shops. Sony is probably not disclosing, but I am guessing their ""production problems"" delays are due to inability to manufacture durable 2-layer discs."
1,Please stay away and save your money till a new version comes out,"I bought this samsung player and played a four blueray movies this weekend, and compared the quality to the HD channels I get from cable and the blueray is not better than regular DVD quality. Its sad the HD version of Last Samurai on cable was better quality than I was able to get on this piece of junk. I read that blueray is using the same compression technique currently on their discs cause they are not able to produce dual layer discs yet.Read this review posted on quality difference.http://www.dvdtown.com/article/reviewofthetoshibahd-xa1hd-dvd/3513/"
2,Firmware update problems,"Nice player, but doesn't upgrade firmware very well. It failed with me so I returned it."
2,Save Your Money -- And Your Sanity,"Samsung gets two stars - one for the amazing picture and one for the sound quality. The actual player, however, is terrible, buggy, unintuitive to use and unreliable. The remote control is so poorly designed as to be useless in a darkened theater room.Also, Samsung refuses to stand behind their product and replace defective units, even though they know this product should never have shipped. Mine has refused to play actual Blu-Ray discs for months now, but all Samsung wants to know is when I'll sen the unit off to them for weeks-long repairs, and, more importantly, how quickly I can get them a check for $160 for the privilege.It's the first--and last--Samsung product I'll buy."
5,brings new life to your collection,"I have purchased a Samsung Blu Ray BD 1000 after months of speculation as I was unsure on purchasing this item as I own a Philips Plasma 1080i(which doesnt support 1080p) and I thought the picture would be limited. How I was wrong, the picture is perfect and it makes a different to your existing collection ....(when you get the chance buy the Blu Ray editon of the movies as there is such a big diiference). Well done Samsung you got it right."
3,Doesn't like 50GB discs,"I bought my player 2 months ago and I must say Blu Ray is stunning ... that is, when my Samsung BD P-1000 plays the disc. Already I have been unable to play 3 discs -- The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, The Descent, and The Pursuit of Happyness. I did some investigation on the internet and found that these are 50GB discs, and that the P-1000 has a difficult time with 50GB. So my player is 2 months old .... and out of date. I phoned Samsung and, without admitting that there is a problem, agreed to send me a firmware upgrade disc. Hopefully it will work .... but I have to wonder to myself, how could they not have anticipated this problem even just a few months ago??"
4,Second Gen in March 2007!,"This player contains most of the features a videophile would enjoy, along with excellent craftsmanship...every bit as good as the Sony or Philips. Samsung is an real up-and-comer, and they are proving it further with their astonishing ***** (solid five star) second generation machine (available in 3/07). I've noticed that many people on this site buy according to recommendations, as shown by a 67% preference to the Philips (first gen.) player that got five stars from a single reviewer. All three of these Blu Ray machines are essentially equal and well deserving of four stars. Please consult video magazines before you buy, you'll very likely end up with the second generation Samsung player due out next month (at time of writing). Thanks to all for their efforts in reviewing products to help others!"
1,Samsung admits problems,It has just been acknowledged by Samsung that the noise reduction chip in the machine was not configured correctly. This leads to the soft pictures people are experiencing.They promise to fix this soon.
1,Unbearably slow loading and stopped playing Blu-Ray after 5 months,"Played Blu-Ray fine for first five months then stopped (still plays regular DVDs). Can't return to the store (past 30days), so only recourse is to mail in for warranty coverage and wait several weeks to get it back.Even when this unit is ""working"", every time you load or eject a disc you are in for a 30 second wait. For example, if you merely want to extract a disc you left in the machine and you press ""open"", you literally wait 30 seconds for it to sort of boot up and say ""welcome"" and so on, and finally eject the disc. My kids are in the habit of pressing the button then running in to the kitchen for a drink -- sometimes they can get back *before* it opens!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I bought this after I had already boughtthe Toshiba machine expecting to see a better picture. What a big disappointment. I returned it after 2 days. First off, despite an HDMI connection to a 1080P Samsung TV, it did not recognise the BluRay discs Terminator and Crash DVDs. Then I played a regular dvd and it recognised that, and only after that did it play the BLU ray discs. The quality was indistinguishable from that from my regular $37 DVD player. There is no user selectable 1080P, only 1080i, component or composite. 1080P according to the manual is disc dependent but even though the discs are 1080P, output remained at 1080i. There is no audio output support via HDMI. The photo viewer takes forever to load each picture.This is really just a bad product."
3,Samsung BD-P1000 Blu-Ray,"great picture quality, a bit slow in booting up but much faster than the Toshiba HD DVD...worked great until it died after one day of normal use. Amazon was great though! They gave me a full refund for a top of the line dvd player that needs a little more work from a reliability stand point."
3,"Good, but not great.","The product upconverts to HD which is why I bought it in the first place. My only problem is when it does this, the colors change to a kind of yellowish. I have to read up on it make sure that everything is where it should be."
1,High expectation flattened in minutes.,"With the falling price making this blu ray player affordable, adding this for our viewing pleasure was our Christmas dream. Our excitement rose once the product arrived. Three hours later, we were quite shaken and definately dissappointed! This unit is difficult to operate, it is way too technical for the average home user, and it does not give a quality picture that you pay the money for. It's early in the blu ray history. Maybe you should wait another year or so until they get it down!"
2,Over Price!!!! Not worth to buy!!!!,"I bought both blu-ray and Hd dvd player at frys and compared them. I am sure that Blu-ray boots up is much quicker than hd dvd player, but blu-ray picture quality is not better than hd dvd player (on stand dvd disc). Hd dvd player's picture quality is sharper than blu-ray. For me, I think we should wait for a while for blu-ray to improve. I like hd dvd player's quality picture, but I really hate when it boots up. It takes 1 to 5 minutes to boot up. Sometime, my wife really get mad about this. I already returned the blu-ray, and I keep the hd dvd player. But if I have a second chance, I will return the hd dvd player too because my wife really hate it's boot up. If hd dvd player boots up quick like the blu-ray than I will say we should buy the hd because it cheapers and half price! So, don't buy them right now wait until both of them improve!"
1,Not Conceptual: Okay to use as workbook,"This book does not explain the concepts involved. Instead, it dives into examples. Further, these examples introduce concepts that are not essential to the subject being discussed, leading to further confusion.Might be ok as a work-book, if you take it, sit at JBuilder, and run each example. However, if what you want is an overview of concepts, this is not the book for you.The typos are irritating too."
4,Gentlemen marry brunettes,"This is a fine collection of ""girl singers"" from the ""bachelor pad"" era. This disc spotlights brunettes. There is another CD that features blondes. There isn't a redheads disc, probably because there aren't enough songs by redheads to fill a CD. Anyway, the disc at hand features a lot of fine brunette singers. Everybody knows Eartha Kitt and Lena Horne, but you also get lesser known girls like Donna Hightower, Pat Suzuki and Linda Lawson. If you are interested in girl singers who can really swing, you should pick up this CD."
3,This cd is for us movie music buffs,"I have always enjoyed good movie music. That is perhaps why i bought this cd. It sure has been what i had hoped it would be. The Boston Pops Orchestra plays in a beautiful style. The only concern i have about the music on this cd is the fact that Johnny Willaims put some of his songs on it. I like Johnny as an orchestra leader, but not as a composer. Sorry, but that's my opinion.I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS CD"
1,Disappointing,"The book was disappointing considering the authors credentials. If you want to know details about why the Titanic sank, airline crashes, Three Mile island etc the book is fine. It dwells excessively on non-business failures. I would say most of those arent that relevant to business as usually business mistakes are made over a period of months/years and not some meltdown or imminent crash scenario as faced by airline pilots. The author tries to extrapolate these to business and falls flatThere is nothing insighful or meaningful and some things like Enron analysis is a re-hash of what we all know"
3,land of the damned. lords of the gym.,"I flew through this book in a couple days. Really fun and easy reading. Not much substance and the dialogue can be painfully forced at times but all in all a very interesting look at L.A. The observations are spot on. Especially regarding the ""lord of the gym."" My advice. Get it used."
5,The Other Side of Mulholland - a native's take on LA,"This is a unique novel: written from the experience of an LA native, dealing with the moronic ambience of TV screenwriting and the essence of East Coast immigrants and corporate drones who venture to Hollywood with jackpot dreams and an absolute absense of talent, it is also the story of a fascinating pair of brothers raised in the San Fernando Valley, their parents and the social ecology of Los Angeles at the Millenium.In addition to Randall's hilarious take on the ridiculous totems in the TV business, it is a serious portrayal of how a talented pair of twins navigate among the unwritten (and unpredicable) currents of the industry, never losing their sense of humor and irony.Recommended highly!"
5,Echoes From Another Realm,"This music seeps out of my speakers and envelops me in a world of strange and mysterious wonders. Almost like a soundtrack from an alien world, the title track opens somewhat aggresively and catapults the listener into a sonic landscape of strange undulations and continues into a more exotic tones and echoes with ""Saucers Over the Zazca."" Each of the songs that follow is a tour through unknown regions and historic mysteries (Dwane is a deep student of the unknown) until we climb the final mountains of strangeness with ""Oracle,"" (which some may recognize from the theatrical trailer to the film ""Fire in the Sky,"")and ""Lights in the Clouds."""
1,"Tears easily, but they are trying to please",The bottom seam tears super easy. I sent it back and they replaced it (grudgingly) and the second one also tore after just one trip. We have one of these that is not mummy shaped and that one holds up just fine. But the mummy style just isn't durable.1/11/12 Sea to Summit called back after they saw this review because they want to offer excellent customer service. They apologized for giving me a hard time when I tried to return the first bag. They also offered to replace the second bag. Hopefully they are fixing the problem.
3,Still no breakthroughs,"Still no breakthroughs. The book's collection of research papers is of good quality. The topics span automatic speech recognition, neural networks, expert systems and other AI topics. What is qualitatively new, compared to a decade earlier, is the inclusion of papers on Internet/Web applications.The overall impression is one of incremental advances. The applications described by the papers are worthy, and complex. B But there still appears to be no fundamental advance in what might be considered to be true AI."
1,"Good story, terrible writing","The author could have used a competent and assertive editor. It was difficult to read more than a few paragraphs without coming across poorly worded sentences, misused words, and just plain bad writing (""the small rain-soaked town that rimmed the shore of Puget Sound like the soggy, grey edge around a bowl of oatmeal...."")."
3,"Exciting reading, but something missing.","Dr. Linda Laura Berfield Hazzard was my second great aunt. I truly enjoyed the book and the way Gregg created his scenes, but I felt the whole time I was reading it that there was something missing. I don't know quite what yet, but something is missing. The descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are great. I am my family's genealogist, and I was given Dr. Hazzard's name about the time Gregg's book came out. I have been to Ollala and could go right to the spot where Wilderness Heights was located. I do higly recommend this book for reading if you like true crime stories. (Would the person from Ferndale, WA get in touch with me, please? Thanks)"
4,great story,This one did not have the pictures in it. Wish it had the pictures as like in the listings. thats all
5,Mesmerizing,"This true crime is not your usual blood and gore but the detailed lives of two sisters caught in a web of lies, deceit and murder. The author makes all of the principal characters interesting and compelling and I felt that I was there rooting for the good guys to win. Absolutely wonderful, terrific read, can't put it down. Totally compelling. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be quiet for a few days."
2,Two books in one?,"I think that if I had just read the second part of the book, the part about the attempts to bring this woman to justice, I would have liked it a lot more. My problem was that I didn't get any sense of how the medical community was viewed by people in the era portrayed in the book. I found myself getting so angry at the people for not doing SOMETHING. I think that if the author had done a better job of putting the situation into context, I would have had an easier time of it. He did a wonderful job of transporting me to the era physically, but emotionally, not so much. I found myself getting irritated more than feeling sympathetic to the ladies' plight. I feel like he could have done a better job putting me in the mindset of the time when an ""osteopath"" was a primary care physician. Perhaps then I could have enjoyed the first half of the book more thoroughly."
5,Riveting,"I grew up in the Pacific NW in the 50's and I had never heard of Starvation Heights, although our family did a lot of camping around Olalla. It was a fascinating story and one I had a hard time putting down considering it was TRUE."
2,Very Drawn Out,"Although I looked forward to reading this book, I found myself plodding through the last half of it. Although it was true story, it was drawn out and disjointed timewise. I finished it because that's what I do, but I would not recommend."
5,A thrilling historical true crime.,"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes true crime, history and/or lives near Gig Harbor. Wish the paperback edition had pictures, but you can find them online."
5,Chilling and fascinating,"This was a really interesting book. A friend of mine was reading it, and I checked out the blurb summary on that back, and it looked really fascinating. After she finished it, I snatched it up. I read the whole thing off and on for 2 days. I could hardly put it down. Even when I wasn't reading I kept thing about what possessed Linda Hazzard to do that. I think she started out meaning well and really believing in the 'cure', and then realized that there was a lot of money and other benefits from just starving people to death. I also don't believe that it was Claire's body. That woman was scary. I'd advise anyone to read it. (provided you have a strong stomach!!)"
5,Mothers Rule The World!,"""The difficulty in finding a baby-sitter will be in direct proportion to how desperatley you need one.""--From Motherhood is not for Wimps.What mother has not experienced the last minute rush to find a baby-sitter when she has to dash out, and the usual sitter has just called to say she can't make it (probably cause she has a new boyfriend!) This book is funny and truthful about being a mom, and in the end reminds the reader that motherhood is the greatest job in the world!"
3,could have been really good,"If the author had a better editor we would have had a better book. As it is, the problem of too many characters and too many mid-chapter time jumps detract from what could have been.Just a couple of examples: The character of the father starts to develop but gets stuck mid-book,and the ending leaves out the last 10 years of his life after the road trip with his son, the narrator...what happened? Where did he work?To be brief the ending itself disappoints - suddenly we seem to be on a symbolic journey after hundreds of 'real life' narrative. Huh?Too bad: it coulda been a real winner."
4,An emotional roller coaster for a 64 year old male,"I think that CJ has updated very accuratly Millers Death of a Salesman. The only thing that I question is this: are people going to relate to Wally Czebek? I sure did to the point that I quite frankly wanted to quite the book but couldn""t. I think that ever sales person should be required to read this book. I had my company cars and my dreams of success. CJ has given us a historical look at life in the 60's and 70's of the company man who was thrown out to pasture to live his dreams or die with his dreams. The wake that is left is the legacy of his children and how Wally's life effected them. You owe it to yourself to read this book."
4,An incomplete riot!,"One would be led to think this 'last' installment of the 'Color Honeymooners' gave us the complete later Honeymooners on dvd. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the dvd companies are thinking for us. They know which episodes we wish to see and what we want left out! There are enough still-unreleased episodes to make another set and lets hope they do just that. For the record- here's what's missing: ""Life Upon The Wicked Stage""-2/11/67... ""6 Months To Live""-11/23/68...""Alice's Birthday""-12/7/68...""Lawsuit""-1/4/69...""Hot Tip""-2/8/69...""New Bowling Ball""3/22/69...""Norton Moves In""-4/5/69...""The New Manager""-4/19/69...""The Incredible World Of Ed Norton""-1/19/70.The Honeymooner's were always a riot - The Color Honeymooner's are no exception ... and these episodes should not be left out. You are dealing with Gleason-Carney fanatics out here, PLEASE don't decide for us what we want to see. This honeymoon is not over, COMPLETE THE RIOT."
2,A GLEASON MISTKAE,"I love Mr.Gleason and the Honeymooners but not going all the way and getting Audrey Meadows to be Alice!! Supposid he did not want to pay what she wanted!! He knew he couldn't do it withoutArt Carney!! Jane Keane is excellent as Trixie but that character never did have much!! but Sheila Macrae as Alice is just plain Awful!!! She can't hold a candle to Audrey Meadows and it just killedthis!! Also I wonder what Gleason was thinking in making them Musicals when non of them could sing!! The June Taylor opening numbers are excellent and guests who were singers like Francis Langfordadd to it but if U chapter foward when they start to sing goes back to the story and makes it a bit better!!! Its funny in that its 1966,ten years later and they are still married 14 years but they are now in their50's!!! Art Carney is the BEST to watch!! He was a Brilliant Comic Actor and Great Dramatic Actor!!Oscar for ""Harry & Tonto"" 1974!! He makes it worth a look!!!..just skip the songs!!!"
3,Color Honeymooners Vol. 4,"Get this set only if you loved the other episodes of the Honeymooners. Three things mar this volume: the producers decided to use bland original stories, working in a different celebrity each time, and Gleason's concentration was lost as he pursued one of the dancers he then married. (Notice his reduced weight.) The stories are all right, but the fun is gone, and Sheila McRae offers nothing but a whiney tone. Even Art Carney seems tired. And yet the episodes have their moments."
3,Wrong episodes listing by Amazon,Amazon has the same episodes listed for this volume as they do for Volume 3.
5,Great Product,"I purchased this exhaust manifold gasket for my Eclipse. It goes on without a problem and you can tell right away it is good quality. My friend also needed to change out his gasket and we decided to go the the parts place where we couldn't find the beck arnley brand so we had to get something else and it was no where near the quality of this gasket for a higher price. Go with this one, you will not be disappointed."
2,Older XSL spec covered,"The book covers what seems to be an older spec for XSL (theremust have not been XLST at the time) (the book published in thebeginning of 98).The book seems to cover CSS stylesheets quite comprehensively. I do not need to have a deeper knowledge of CSS so I have not read any other books on the subject and cannot compare.Examples and explanatory text in the book seem a bit difficult to comprehend, especially if browsing. Even when reading carefully it seemed to be more difficult to understand what each example illustrated that other reference books I have read. END"
4,In The Line Of Fire,"I saw this movie when it first came on TV. Michael Gross gives a chilling performance, the best of the entire cast. It is based on an actual ""case"" and that lends credibility to the acting."
3,TV movie,"It wasn't as good as I remembered it. It was interesting however, and worth the small amount of cash I paid for it."
3,As good as I remember it,"This was one of the CBS In the Line of Duty Series, I believe it was the first if I am not mistaken. It details the 1986 shootout between FBI Agents and two heavily armed bank robbers, which became known as the Miami Massacre.All of the actors do a competent job in the rolls. The standout is Michael Gross, coming of his roll in Family Ties, does an outstanding job as William Mattox. This is one of Bruce Greenwoods early rolls and he does an ok job.The movie glosses over the fact the most of the Agents were SWAT Team members and had better weapons than the armed robbers. But the weapons along with their heavy body armor was in their trunks. The final shootout is extremely accurate from the accounts I have read.It was worth the $7.99 price I paid for it. Good movie, worth picking up."
5,no kitchen should be without one,"I have used and sold many kinds of knife sharpeners and the Mcgowan Electric Knife sharpener is by far the best and easiest to use. Not the most advertised or carried in the big ""Gourmet"" retailers, buy this appliance and don't waste you money on the others !"
5,Nut Sauce Is Not Nutty,"I have an American Deluxe Strat and a VG Strat that both have tremolos. I would not use the tremolos because they easily went out of tune. After just ONE APPLICATION of Big Bend's Nut Sauce on the nut, bridge saddles and fulcrum points, both guitar amazingly stay perfectly in tune, even with heavy tremolo use. I highly recommend Nut Sauce!"
2,Is it me?,"I tried it twice and it seems to deaden my tone. I applied it to the nut and to the bridge as per the directions. Played through a clean setting with no pedals and my tone seems affected. The strings didn't have the same chime as before. Unless I'm not applying it correctly, I'm not sure I want to try it again."
4,Better than you'd think.,"It was worth the $9. I found out about Honest Bob from Rock Band, as most everyone probably did. Second and Eighteen has 18 songs [aha!], most of them catchy pop ones. And most of them are good. There's clever lyrics, but not too clever; good songwriting, not great; in sum, this band doesn't entirely succeed at breaking out of the logjam that is the music industry, but it's a fun listen, and a couple of the songs are extremely catchy.Head in a Hole is an amazing cover, and Don't Look Right and Red Integra are really good, as are I Get By and Tatooine. And as I look at the listing again I'm starting to remember that all of the other songs are good, too. It's worth a purchase."
2,Meh.,"So much work for a very weak and not vivid product. The prints were pale and ""watercolory"" looking, an I was really going for something more rich. I wouldn't have minded all the chemical mixing, and paper prepping that you have to do if the result were worth it, but it wasn't. I dont really recommend this product to anyone. I am going to look for a different brand."
3,just not great,"It worked fine, not exactly the way I was expecting. I wanted something stronger and the fact you have to use something in the water its not that great"
2,Second one has now died,"Love the dictionary WHEN IT WORKS!. Had one, it died. Bought another one and it lasted a year and just died. I put in new battery, tried the reset button - it's just dead... Same thing as before. Very disappointing since they cost so much. I'm tempted to buy a third one - who knows - maybe it will live.... dp"
2,Great gift.....not exactly.,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I thought it was a perfect gift for me. I read a lot and knew I would get a lot of use out of it. Quite a number of words I was looking up weren't in this dictionary so I was disappointed about that. Then sometime in February...not even 2 months of use...the unit stopped working. I thought it was the battery so I changed the battery. It still didn't work. I thought there was a chance that the new battery could have been bad also so this time I took the unit to a battery store. They tested both batteries and both were fine. It was the unit itself that stopped working. I tried the reset button located on the back of the unit, but nothing happened with that either.I had high hopes, but am very disappointed"
2,Still going to look,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and I have two main complaints. First, and more important, I would say 1/3 of the words I look up are not in this product. I have a decent vocabulary, but I'm no lexicographer, and it's frustrating not to find so many words. The second complaint is that the buttons are difficult to push and I wish the product would default to ""dictionary mode"" when I turn it on, rather than always have to push an extra button to get there. It is a dictionary after all--why would I buy this if I really wanted a calculator? It's a nice feature, but bury that somewhere else and make it easy for me to look up my word without having to push extra buttons (which are hard to push!) I'm sure there's something better out there...now I'm off to find it."
2,Not for the Serious Reader,"I bought this because it sounded like such a great idea.Unfortunately, every other word that I needed to look up wasn't in it.This is a good BASIC dictionary, which will probably be useful to students and light readers, but if you are an AVID READER like me, and read everything from history to science fiction, this device may not serve you well."
1,Worked for five minutes,"This product worked for about five minutes but then failed. After 4 resets, it has remained stuck on the date. I'll be returning it."
1,Disappointment,"I seldom find a word I look up included; about 90% of the time I have to go to another, more complete dictionary. That is disappointing. I also find it hard to enter the letters, they often don't register as the touch board is too flexible. For reading on the fly it doesn't work, a hard surface is needed. So I mostly don't bother. Shame, as it's a good idea - it really bugs me to read a word and not be able to know its meaning!"
1,ugg Where to start?,"Note: product did not help me correct spelling errors in this review. So don't dis me.Good:Light weight, easy to hold. Battery lasts a long timeOnly good for looking up words as you're readingBad:* Too few display rows...letter height is small and gray on gray. I don't see color well..difficult to readUgly:* Clock. Why? Designers needed to stay on task...give a good dictionary* Dictionary. Missing, spelling lookup, pronounciation, limited vocab* Calculator. Light Blue small text key pad numbers. If you're color blind or need reading glasses...good luck!* Convert. Product noticably unfinished. Unusable. Convert Acres? Hectares?? who cooks up this stuff. MISSING Oz <--> ML, Mi<-->K, LB<-->kGMs"
5,A complete Jewish-American name book.,"I found this book to be the best, most complete book of names for an English-speaking parent-to-be of Jewish heritage. Everything is included: English/Anglo-Saxon/American (even some Spanish and French), and of course, Yiddish, Biblical/Talmudic, and Israeli names."
5,This book is the BEST book for researching Hebrew-English names.,"I started my business, [...], eleven years ago. This book has been, my ""bible"" since the beginning, augmented by a number of his other books esp. ""The New Name Dictionary - Modern English and Hebrew Names."" Kolatch is a consummate researcher of both the names and the biblical references. I trust his translations completely. All of his books are of this caliber. This man has my utmost respect. Sarahleah Hankes"
1,Terrible,The author has no familiarity with his subject and routinely provides the reader with incorrect information.
4,"Good Info on IBD, but overly technical","This is a technical overview of IBD covering anatomy, how the gut works, history andepidemiology, possible causes, treatments and complications and medications (not entirely up todate as the book was published in 1989). The book claims in it's foreword to be written for the layman, but be forewarned the anatomychapter is quite detailed with lots of medical terminology. Let's put it this way, after reading thischapter you will be able to understand the research reports in the national newsletter! (Do youknow the difference between your sub-mucosa and your myenteric plexus?) The remainder of thebook is more 'reader-friendly' with lots of good information for the newly diagnosed."
3,A little sappy,This book was a little sappy for my taste. I think it's a book more appropriate for a 60+ year old very sentimental woman.
4,Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover's Soul.,The Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover's Soul: Amazing Sea Stories by Jack Canfield came fast enough and was in fair condition. It seems like an interesting book.
3,"Good VB programming info, not much VBA though.","This book is misnamed. It should be the VB Developers handbook. It's a good book for VB and worth having (For that I would give it 4 stars), but if you are looking for information on VBA specifically (as the title implies) you will be sadly disappointed."
4,VBA Hand book,This book is a little out of date but still contains valuable information on VBA. I was able to gleam imformation for much more then the cost.
4,Good for Excel and Access Programmer's,"After browsing through 200 pages that talked in-depth and almost exclusively about string and date manipulation functions, I realized that this book is not for me. I decided to return it. If I ever delve deeply into accounting apps, I'll grab this book again. It's a great book! The one flaw is that it sells itself as an OFFICE book, when it's focus in a practical sense is really toward Excel and even moreso, Access Programmers."
1,"VBA? Book should be titled ""VB with additional VBA insights""","I expected great detail using VBA with both Excel and Word. What a disappointment! This book discussed items like dealing with the registry, sort routines, etc. Many of which have nothing to do with VBA but are more general coding techniques/issues. Very misleading title for the content of this book!"
3,VB versus VBA,"Page xxi has ""As a developer, I don't want to have to write a charting application from the ground up. And with Microsoft Excel, I don't have to. Need a corporate calendar or contact management system? You can customize Microsoft Outlook..."" This foreword from a Microsoft Product Manager should not belong in this book. This book's chapter on automation describes customizing the toolbar. It doesn't guide you through the above. It does not include info on using VBA with DNA to accomplish client/server programming. The title of the book is misleading. The book is more about code. On the positive note, this book accomplishes its objective. It provides ready-to-run code on a number of topics. It provides the information you need to view or add information to the registry or some other intermediate or advanced topic without explaining the details of why serious developers are interested in those topics. The book requires VBA 5.0. Microsoft has released a newer version."
3,VBA Developer's handbook,"While to book was intact it was not in GOOD condition according to my opinion. I would have rated it well worn and in fair condition. In addition, the paper it was wrapped in was very thin and when it arrived here was torn in multiple places causing additional ""wear"" on the out side cover, and bound end of the book."
4,Duck Call review,Great call. I am a beginner and I had no problem learning to blow the call. Rapid shipment.
5,Riveting,"De Grazia introduces you to a boy who slides into a harsh world. The narrative is in the first person, and you are witness to how someone faces life on the street by joining a gang of anti-nazi skin heads. The book is very well written."
2,best thing about this book is the cover,"...i had so much high hopes for this book too..in the begining it was ok and when he started to hang out with the skins was the best part but after he leaves them its all down hill from there....a couple of things i hated where that almost everyone he met had some connection with his dad or meets his dad.. and how he meets tim in jail come on, thats almost impossible ...if ur looking for a book to teach u about skins heads look elswhere....he was never into the skin head scean in the first place and didnt even like or stay a skin head...."
5,An Eclectic Gem!,"This interesting compilation of favorite tracks played by the immortal DJ, B. Mitchel Reed, is a must for any lovers of free-form radio and obscure music tracks. While tracks by artists such as The Byrds and Steppenwolf are familiar classics now, the clear standouts are Jefferson Airplane's version of ""Wooden Ships,"" and Brewer and Shipley's terrific cover of Jim Pepper's rockin' ""Witchi-Tai-To."" The late Mike Bloomfield's guitar mastery is evident on the Electric Flag's ""Killing Floor,"" and Tina Turner manages to make ""Honky Tonk Women"" more interesting than the original. Perhaps what's best of all are BMR's signature voiceovers and commercials in between the tracks that really put this CD over the top. Highly recommended for all radio and music lovers!"
2,Is FM Radio Cool?,"Since the advent of the F.M. rock radio format in the early 70's, A.M. radio has been relegated to the status of ""uncool"", which is more than unfair. A.M. radio lives on in the hearts of ""real"" radio fans, who listen to the likes of Art Bell and Jay Marvin(WLS Chicago). These guys are the true ""rogues"" of the airwaves, discussing relevant issues and stirring up the rebel in all of us. For me, the ""real"" underground radio is still found on A.M."
1,"What a ""barker""!","On the homepage, you will see the cover scan I put up for the VHS. Sexy chick with leathers and a leopard print flimsy top makes you want to view the movie, but don't be fooled! The slip cover art is the best part of the whole movie. In my day, the movie would be called a ""barker"" or a ""dog"". I give it a ""10"" on the ""Biker Scale"". The Biker Scale means how many real bikers it would take to drag me to my couch and make me watch it again.The bikes are crappy, the bikers are wannabees, the story line is lame, the hep talk is corny, the chicks are desirable - but only after a 12 pack. I love biker movies, and usually find some redeeming quality in the worst of them. But seriously, this one is BAD!"
3,Might be too easy for some kids,"My daughter went through the entire exercises in one afternoon. This CD-ROM might be more of a challenge for 1st grade students. She did enjoy the exersices, and it was a great way for her to practice her computer skills. Overall she enjoys reviewing the material on the disc. Great for beginning readers."
2,Much too basic and does not cover much on inspection,This checklist book has some photographs of homes that were OK but the checklist and text part of the book was much too basic. None of the parts of a home inspection were revealed or included in this book. So it is NOT a worksheet with 111 checklists but only a very basic and simple guide. I could not recommend this to anyone. Get another book that has a more complete checklist that you can use and that is helpful. You will never be able to do a home inspection from using this checklist book. If you did then you will be risking a lot since you will not know what to check out and inspect if this book is your guide!!!!
3,It's great,"I found this book and all it contained was good for the beginner who want to study Italian. It is easy to learn, no doubt!"
1,Disappointing Delivery,"Frankly, I expected a higher calibre of book. It looks like Mom & Pop published it. It is rife with spelling and punctuation errors. Pituitary is spelled...pituatary. Give me a break. What kind of credibility does this woman deserve if the she can't even master the mechanics of spelling and punctuation. So she spent one whole day at Cornell Medical library doing research (5 hours, 2 of which she admittedly slept). Her three hours of research at Cornell are about what the book is worth. It has pedestrian information about Cushing's syndrome. A trip to the internet is worth five of her books."
2,"a story, not a guide.","This is more of a personal account than a Patient Guide. It's a story with a nice ending.The book provided me, a family member of someone with Cushings, with more insight into Cushings, which gave the syndrome/disease, more credibility in my eyes. I gained a better understanding of my family member and am definitely more sensitive to the issues. Prior to reading it, I had no concept of the extent of the symptoms of this disease. The author has the unique and fortunate situation of obviously being financially secure -- always helpful when dealing with a long-term, medical situation.The book would have more value and a wider audience (perhaps professionals in the field of Case Management and Psychology)if it included some outcome or general prognosis information on a variety of cases with information on socio-economic factors."
3,Enjoyable Read,"Jason Pfeiffer has a passion for writing horror movies, especially ones that star his sister as the monster. Tank Talbott has a passion for beating kids up. When Jason discovers that he and tank can be mistaken for each other, he comes up with a plan allowing Tank to get out of dance and himself out of swimming. The switch gives Jason a new appreciation for Tank as the two become friends. This novel will likely appeal to readers with its humor and predictable, but enjoyable, plot."
5,Great Lounge music!,"I think I was born in the wrong era! This is a great CD and so much fun to listen to. I also bought several CD's from the Ultra Lounge series. Another great purchase. Thanks Amazon for grouping similar items together, or I never would have found this CD!"
1,Reform isn't Jewish Living,"""This definitive guide for Reform Jewish practice"" ignores the fact that the Reform movement (from Germany) did away with all ritual practices, and only recently added some back optionally, when its membership was dying. Ask an elder ""Reform"" person how many of his grandchildren are Jewish.""Jewish Living is an ideal gift for b'nei mitzvah, confirmation, and graduation"" -- Buy the kid a Kitzur Shulchan Aruch so he knows what the true Jewish law is. And just wtf is a ""confirmation""? Find that in the last 3300 years of our history. Seriously."
3,A Decent Book,Not a great book but well written. I think the author should speak to his audience in a clear and more concise fashion
5,Amazing,My wife and I have been taking Umcka for years. At the first sign of a cold we begin taking Umcka and it keeps the doctor away.
1,Umcka coldcare drops contains alcohol,I ordered the Umcka coldcare for children a few months ago and it taste great. So I ran out of the children's Umcka and I thought how bad could the original one be. Boy was I wrong...it tastes like pure alcohol! The children's Umcka coldcare drops contains no alcohol and taste great. If you are someone who likes to drink alcoholic beverages then maybe the taste won't bother you.
2,overpriced,this is nice cold prevention/treatment but the price keeps going up on amazon and the current price is almost double what you can find elsewhere. I wish you could trust sellers on amazon not to overcharge.
3,Architectural Desktiop 2: Fundamentals Student Manual,"If your versed in the Softdesk R8 Architectural package then this book will not hold your interest. There are so many fine points ommited it's rather like the ADT 2 Users Guide. Not much help.But if you have limited experience w/ an autocad architectual package, this is a good reference.I have heard that there is to be an Advanced ADT R2 Customization Manual in the works for those who crave more in-depth workings of ADT.Such as why endcaps must be created as a polyine in cc rotation, are additive in nature and the endpoints must align in the same plane so the caps don't rotate. And the many various ways walls can be define and where and when to use each. Door and window styles customization of jambs, sills, grills and workarounds like creating a door thats really a window style in a window wall so you can get a overall frame opening dimensions, etc."
5,A MUST BUY SOFTWARE!,"I really enjoyed the Original Speed Busters because it had all this cool graphichs and muscle cars. And in this newer and better version of Speed Busters it will sell like Hot Potatoe. Its especially has more than ten tracks going into Canada, U.S and Mexico.If you like high jumps and drag race or even real life collisiions, you will like Speed Busters II"
4,Very nice for the price.,"This works great. The only thing that I don't like is that it is too easy to hit the off button when using the product. I have hit the off button every time I used it. I have to be very careful when winding my hair on the barrel so that I don't accidentally turn the iron off. Otherwise, it is great and I love the small barrel size."
5,Fast and Easy.!,"This curling iron is Great, gets my hair done very fast and it last for a couple of days, I use it on #20 heat and never had a problem with it getting accumulations on the rod or with the temperature, I also like that it comes with a sleeve to protect it when you travel."
1,"Yo, Genius!","You gave these guys a 5-star rating despite your diatribe? Maybe you're not such a genius after all. Even accounting for the three ""incorrect"" answers, you're only average on the densa scale, and that seems plenty generous to me."
3,Good Effort,"There are 2 ""ins"" in an inning and no outs. (in)n(in)gAlso, the doctor question seems to personify the pills. In this case, this patient is obviously a psychiatric one. The pills will last indefinitely, telling the patient every half hour, ""take one"".Perhaps the test could be revised to correct these questions where there seems to be more than one correct answer. This way the intelligence of the more elevated thinkers might be more accurately assessed(smile)."
2,Save your money.,"I have read many books in this genre and would have to say that this is the first author that I have come across that includes so many vivid sexual encounters in his writings. I can handle it once in a while, but it got to be too much for me. Honestly, I didn't care all that much for ""Carry the Wind"" either. If you are looking for a good mountain man book, try ""The Big Sky"" by Guthrie. If you are looking for a 1800s romance novel, this should work."
4,Dream Interrupted,"Know someone who started out on a quest and never made it?There are two things about this book that I got caught up in. First, the description of the life of those who rode the flat boats down the Ohio and on down the Mississippi. I learned a lot about a way of life I was barely conscious of and it opened up a whole new area of interest for me.Second is how sidetracked one can get in life. People don't always reach their destination on the first, second or even third try. And a lot of times, for those who risk, they don't ever make it. People make mistakes, they screw up, and sometimes they give up. The course of one's life is rarely a straight path and this book is about as good an account of that as your likely to find."
1,Ick,"Sorry to disagree with you guys...but I think this book is terrible. The writing is cliche and ungrammatical, and in some cases dumb (""he had to admit he cared for the bony whore""??) the storyline was contrived and unrealistic, and I was NOT interested in the naive character of Titus Bass."
5,"In 1961, who won the NATIONAL Book award? J.D. Salinger, Joseph Heller, or Walker Percy?","Walker Percy is the greatest American novelist of the later half of the 20th century. Why? Because he understood the mind of the character and placed him in a an existential conundrum which we all share as part of our own DNA. We become the character because the placement in a particular situation is compelling and real. In effect it is commonplace and ordinary. Now, in 1961 WP beat out Salinger and Heller as a last minute entry by his publisher. Sometimes chance has a way of making the world just a little bit brighter. A great book."
2,Expensive Hydrogen Peroxide,The active ingredient in this product is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).Pro:Better for the environment than chlorine bleach (NaOCl).Cons:Does not work as well as chlorine bleach.More expensive than medicinal bottles of hydrogen peroxide.Rating: ** out of *****
2,Too disjointed,"This work has some very good sections. Houever in my opinion, they are too few and this novel is comprised of vignettes that have no, or extremely tenuous ties. Overall I found it to be a tiring read, and not one of the better of this genra. My opinion may have been coloured by my not having read any of the previous works by Ashe, consequently I had no familiarity with the story line('s).I won't go out of my way to read other works by this author."
3,Okay,This is much less then an ipod or ipod mini but its okay but not great. I only recorded 1985 My Happy Ending and Yeah! But it says that its memory is full!
3,Ear bud too large,My 11 year old and I have both tried to make the hard plastic ear bud fit nicely into an ear--but it is extremely uncomfortable. I cannot imagine a younger child using it. It is almost twice the size of my Jabra headset for my cell phone. We have resorted to using ear phones which she says defeats the purpose of being small and portable. She would also like one that can record more music. I do not know what age this is designed for.
3,Play it Now...good idea for younger kids,"My 10 and 6 year old daughters both received the Play it Now as gifts. My 10 year old had a lot of fun with it. She was recording music in no time. It's supposed to be able to record 30 minutes of music however we've only been able to record about 15 minutes worth. She recorded music from the radio. I don't know if that had anything to do with the amout of songs she was able to store.In general, my 10 year old has enjoyed this toy. She has had it for almost a year. For a child 8-10, this is a good alternative to an MP3 player. However for someone older than 10, initially they will enjoy it but the novelty will wear off quickly. My daughter is now 11. She doesn't even pick up the Play it Now anymore. I plan on buying a low end MP3 player for her."
4,Great,"Great, u can put alot of music on it it's just like a real mp3 player but with games and screensavers, it's very cool!"
3,Stopped Working Too!,"New from Hasbaro! Play it Now!Fisrt time I heard about this i was about 11 years old, and sick in bed. I though, oh my god! thats great!So i jumped out of bed, and bought it.Right now im 12 years old and I recently uncovered it in my drawer after cleaning up my desk.SWEET! I got it back! Although the sound was very unclear and it isnt the best thing, i was very excited to retrive it.Uh-O! Memory full! thats alright I'll delete all my songs.Still the memory is full.Reset the player.Stil the memory is full.I still have not recovered this problem, but dont waste your money unless u get ir for 10 dollars.Bye."
1,Junk,I could not load any songs from a computer and had a hard time loading from a cd. The instruction manual does not help at all. I have an IPod so maybe I am use to drop and drag. I worked on it for at least an hour and could not get any songs loaded. I will be taking it back on December 26th adding a few more bucks and purchasing a real mp3 player.
2,sounds good isn't worth it,"i bought 3 for my three girls and they really aren't very good, they just break off pieces or it doesn't ever work"
3,Stopped Working!,"My 12 year son only used this item a few times and suddenly it would not hold any songs at all. Even though it was empty, the player keep saying that there was no more memory. It will not record! Cheap, shoddy, Too pricey for what you get. The only plus was the ease at which you can record songs off the radio or a cd. The games were okay too."
1,"STUPID THING, NEVER, I REPEAT NEVER BUY IT!!!!!!!","I got this stupid thing for christmas last year. I used it and I thought it was soooooo cool!!! It turns out that I was wrong!! One day when I was using it, the thing just stopped, so I was thinking oh I have to change the batteries. Once I put them in I tryed to turn it on but it didn't work!!! OK WHAT IS GOING ON I thought to myself. Sooo, I then press the reset button and nothing happened I tried it again and the reset button popped out!!!!!!!! IT NEVER WORKED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!AND THAT'S A TRUE STORY!! So whatever you do DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
5,love it,I bought 3 of these mp3 players for birthdays for kids under 6 Two of them for our twins who are 5 they wanted ipods like their older brothers ages 15 and 13. So we got them these. They love the fact that they have their own little ipods. They listen to them all the time. The other was for our niece she is 6 . So we decided why pay so much for a little child. She loves her to. I won't buy it for a any child over 11 they want loads and loads memory which this doesn't have. Its great for the little ones and the cost is great. I was going to get the blue play school mp3 but it really isn't one My friend has one and she told No. So after we bought these. I told her about them and now she has 2 and her children love them. The only thing I wish it came in different colors. we had to mark our so the kids know which one is their.
3,poor sound recording quality,I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter. I was getting it set up for her before xmas. For one the record quality is terrible. Then the computer downloads are complicated
2,just dont get this toy get a mp3 player,one day i saw the commercial 4 playitnow.i thought it was so cool. i got it 4 christmas and i started using rite away.it worked really good.the sound was alright.then comes the last week of school.everybody is allowed watever they want.i bring my playitnow (i only had 10 songs which is a waste.)there was this song i recorded yesterday and deleted it already but when i tryed 2 listen 2 a complete different song and then comes up da song i deleted already.then all the rest of the songs get cut short.then i thought of deleting them all and trying the songs all over again but then it said memory full but there were no songs on the thing.this is not worth ur money.get a mp3 player or ipod then go buy ur songs or get a napster card which is at best buy or watever website u find that has free songs .trust me its wayyyyyyyy beter than playitnow
2,good for kids (if f 9 or younger),I'm 12 yers old and this toy is no fun. the sound that you get isn't as good as an mp3 player. parents please if you want to get them a music player your goning to have to either get them a cd player or an mp3 player. For kids that listen to musiac alot you should get an mp3 player. I had alot of music that I wanted and the play it now didn't have enough room. The games arn't very good unless you don't have any game systems. Plus you have to wait to finish the songin order to record the whole thing.
4,I like this product so far,"I have a 23 year old Oldenburg who spent his younger years as a three day eventer. My farrier recommended B-L solution as an alternative to Bute because it is supposed to be easier on the liver. I used the product for the first time yesterday after a long trail ride and he shows no sign of lameness or stiffness today. I mixed 1 ounce in with his beet pulp and King's 20/20 and at first he wasn't too sure about the flavor but in no time gobbled it up. I rated this product a four not because I haven't seen results, but because I've used it only once so far so I can't really judge it yet."
5,"It flies, it twirls, it's fun to watch!!",This is an awesome product for any one who likes Green Lantern whether a fan of the comic or of the cartoons. It's fun to watch your favorite super-hero fly in circles above your head!! I recommend this product to any one who likes Green Lantern or the Justice League!
1,This stinks,"I had a chance to listen to this CD, and boy I was disappointed. It didn't get the laughs I was expecting. Most of his stuff from the 80's was far better. Sorry Rick, but I don't recommend this to anyone."
5,I had great fun.,The Animals Journey to The Moon is a very good Book. I love all the animals. The wise old owl is cool. I love it very much. I wish I could go to the moon. Maybe I will some day. The book is so so so funny I hope people young and old read it because they will like it too.
1,boring,"i was forced to read this book. I'm not interested in the subject at all, however, i could have dealt with a 10 page outline of events and statistics, or something similar to put the point across. Im not interested in reading about how these people talk in the car.my question: if those of us who are forced to read this book did not purchase it, would the author have sold any copies?"
3,"too much filler, but the subject deserves a star itself","One thing that I can't stand is when a writer wastes my time with information that I don't need. For instance, while writing about a weather incident that happens somewhere, he begins the story with irrelevant examples of what 5 or 6 people are doing at the time just before this incident happens. I'm sorry, but I just don't care!! Picky? Yes, but I do get the feeling he's being paid by the word. Time is so precious, stick to the info Bob.The book is pretty well informed, and he takes a good stab at it. This subject deserves so much more attention than it gets. Just get ready to endure more than a few needless sentences."
3,you get what you pay for,it seems to work great but is limited in its verticle capability. it has no adjustment for verticle viewing.
2,Description is WRONG,"I bought this as an outside camera-like the title says, so I could monitor my front door. When it arrived, it clearly said ""indoor use only"". I wrote Amazon about this error 2 months ago, and as you can see, it still hasn't been fixed. Since it's indoor only and I have no use for an indoor camera, I can't rate it as to how well it works."
1,Damaged printer and no customer service,"On the 26th of Dec. I opened the shipping package and discovered the back of the printer bashed in and the toner cartridge and the toner cartridge packaging broken allowing toner to go everywhere. I immediately emailed for a RMA and a refund. On Dec 28 I got an email stating I would get a full refund in 10 business days. Its now 15 business day and nothing has happened. The purchase was from one of Amazon's independent sellers so apparently amazon really isn't interested in providing customer service. I found the customer service link on one of Amazon's pages. I sent a message to Amazon, but could not REPLY to Amazon's non-responsive response as it is set up as a one way message rather than for a two way communication 1/20/2007."
4,"""Wade Through, Not Wade In""","The hanging captain's death is believed to be a suicide (possibly due to impotence, a desire to frame his wife's lover, or financial difficulties), until a Priestleyish guest proves murder, much to the horror of the Chief Constable, who wishes to hush it all up. There are only two suspects, who, of course, each need a detective to follow their trail: an interesting technique that, dividing the reader's sympathies between the cocky and impetuous Lott and the unimaginatively logical Dawle, focuses the interest on the detection without the need for any silly most unlikely culprit. Despite the central plateau where Lott checks the High Sheriff's theatrical Birmingham alibi, one can only applaud Wade's cunning manipulation of alibis, motives and circumstantial evidence.Why doesn't Lott consider that the Braston tyre mark could have been made before the night of the crime?"
5,Evac a Big Hit,"Evac was indeed a big hit with my grandson. As with all of the other toys in this line, it's well-made and durable. I highly recommend this toy. Amazon was just a little more expensive $[...], but I've ordered many items from them and can rely on their having it and fast mailing."
5,More Pure Dance!,"Have volumes one, two and three. All very good music to just listen and drift into other worlds. All volumes are very well put together selections."
3,Glad I found this.,"I was recently traveling on a transoceanic flight and heard an entire medley dedicated to Katrina. One of the selections was the Levee Prayer by Jimmy Thackery. The song was both inspirational and haunting. I was not familiar with Jimmy Thackery before this. After hearing only one selection, I knew I had to investigate further. I went to Amazon, listened to a few sample cuts and ordered the CD. I am quite glad I found this and would recommend it.Gene Muratore"
3,Needs Expanding,"This is a decent overview on the issue, but Mr. McNair spends too much time examining pornographic magazines, and no time at all discussing the Internet. He was quite clearly wrong in stating there has not been a trend towards more violent imagery, anyone perusing the net can attest to that. So, the book is in need of an update."
5,Cool,Great for installing a new stereo. No need to strips wires or anything simple as match the colors.
2,It put me to sleep,"I wanted a video that could capture that feeling I received when I first walked down the Charles Bridge at night or mingled in the busy castle district of Prague during the changing of the guard. I gave this video a shot. As mentioned below, the sound is very poor and the narrator is so monotone that I fell asleep. It covered most of the areas that I wanted to see around Prague (that's why I give two stars) but the video quality looked like it was taken by a tourist with a basic camcorder. It wasn't done as well as some of the Lonely Planet shows, which was more of the the type of video I was looking for. If you don't mind getting a video that isn't exclusively on Prague, I'd suggest Eastern Cities Travel the World: Prague, Budapest and Istanbul with Rick Steeves. With very few videos on Prague available, that one takes the cake, not this one."
1,Poor Quality,"It is not only the sound track that is poor. There is too much distortion to watch this video. This video is a total disappointment. This earns one star because I can't enter my comment without it. Try ""Super Cities Prague."" The quailty of ""Super Cities Prague"" is much better."
4,"Very complete, if not disjointed, with poor sound quality.","The video takes you to many of the tourist sights, and the overall content was very good. The audio, however, was so bad I had to jack up the volume and put up with the hiss."
1,"IF YOU ENJOY AGGRAVATION, PURCHASE THIS LAPTOP",Poor/sluggish performance even after upgrading memory to 2GB.Takes quite a bit of time to boot up/down.Does not respond well to automatic Windows updatesDO NOT TRY TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS VISTA HOME PREMIUM!! I tried and the computer is completely unusable! Common/expected functionality non-existant! HP Support not available after upgrade!
3,"OMIT ""THE NAME GAME"" AND YOU'VE GOT A GOOD CD","This is a fun, family friendly collection with the exception of ""the Name Game."" That idiotic tune has nothing under the sun to recommend it. Ever since I was a very little child, I found it irritating to the point of having to leave. I just couldn't stand it! It is stupid, highly unpleasant and darned grating on the nerves. I hate the gibberish on it and the tune belongs in the toilet. It has no redeeming features. I am glad today my name isn't being slaughtered in this exercise in dementia.The other tunes on this are good, straightforward fun. The ""Witch Doctor,"" is fun ""nonsense,"" not madness. ""Tall Paul"" is cute and catchy. Like I said, omit the ""Name Game"" and you've got yourself a good cd."
1,Very disappointed.,"Aside from them not being as sharp as described before purchasing, there is a lot of friction between blades that hinders proper usage. I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,"This is good, but it could be better","The design is pretty much amazing!I bought it in USA for less than 50 bucks, and in my country (Brazil) its probably 150 or more...The sound is good. Its not too loud, but thats ok...The problem for me is the remote control... It doesnt works! OMG!And... Mine arrived in my house with two scratches...But... If you just want a stereo system, medium... This is a good option."
1,Hummmmmmmmmm.......,"I'm very disapointed about this product.I bougth that on June 2, 2007. But the seller did not shipped to me the correct product.That was I bougth: Coby CX-CD389 Micro CD/MP3 Stereo System with AM/FM & USB Card Slot but I received that one: Coby CX-CD387 Micro CD Stereo System with AM/FM tuner, So, the last one don't plays MP3 and don't have any facility for USB.I'm very auful about this situation.Please give me a solution for my PROBLEM, thank'sAna Mele"
1,NO CRASH MODE! Wha?,Previous to this release every Burnout game has included a crash mode. THIS DOES NOT! I was extremely disappointed.
1,For Bachelors,"If you don't want to impress a woman, this CD is for you. Every woman who I have played it for laughs. It isn't romantic. It is jokey. Nice for a gathering of boys sipping martinis, but not for seduction. It is interesting, early electronic music, but it is not for the ladies. If you are a musical historian, you will enjoy this. If you want to set a mood for woo, keep this off your turntable."
2,Loved this but ...,Bought several cookie cutters for my sister's baby shower. I wanted to give friends and family a more personal gift bag. This cookie cutter was one of my favorite but it wasn't easy to use. It would get caught in the cookie dough.
4,A Good Mix,"I have heard AVB live mix at Creamfields before but this is the first time I have actually bought his music. I am a big fan of Tiesto, and think he is a great DJ. With this CD, I had to hear it a few times to get into his music. First few tracks threw me off because its pretty mellow and slow. I found track 4 to be pretty good and track 7 shouldn't be really there. But he made all his tracks flow pretty easily. Also, I did find that when people are screaming loud, it can be irritating. I personally like DJs live music better than their albums because they have a good flow and its upbeat. I didn't like DJ Tiesto's Nyana too much. It was pretty mellow...If you like live mixes, you should check out Tiesto's Magik 6 and 7. Also, Live mix by Tall Paul at Club Space Session 2 and Live Mix Spundae of Ferry Corsten. Great music!!! It will keep you going. So far AVB is good and I wouldn't mind seeing him live :)"
4,Classic,"If you want to know about Classic D&D, here is the adventure for you. Ghostly meals. 100 foot tall zombies. A maiden and a unicorn. Really strange stuff, and an introduction to Clark Ashton Smith to boot."
5,Excellent pocket knife,"I bought this knife because street laws in Chicago requires a blade length of 2.5"" and I figured that this knife would do the job. I also bought this knife to open boxes at work. The pocket knife is well constructed and it doesn't feel cheap in your hands. The blade needs to be manually flipped out but that's not a big deal. It has a nice grip in my hands and it feels natural. It's also very small so you can clip it in your pants pocket and won't take up a lot of room.Overall, I would recommend anyone who is interested in buying a small pocket knife to purchase this one. It's well constructed and has great ergonomics."
4,Good for the money,Bought this for my father in law he has enjoyed it. This would be a fine knife for anyone wanting a small one
2,Alright,"Not bad, but I doubt I'll get more than a couple uses out of these. Sometimes you pay for what you get. And that's what I got."
1,Bwahahahaha!,"Very funny! I can only imagine how stupid the people who shelled out money for this must be feeling right now. But Jesus, how braindead would you have to have been? I mean, REALLY: ""staying warm?"" ""accessing cash?"" ""Coping without utilities and transportation?"" Come ON! Do you people ever take it into your heads to actually THINK about something before mindlessly jumping onto the ol' bandwagon of mass hysteria? Good lord, that's amusing."
2,Short of trying to create chaos,"This book coverd alot of topics to the point of becoming outlandish and almost alarming. The follow through research was weak. This book was written for a ""Misery Loves Company"" society. Look for something more realistic!"
3,Wake up!,"Mr Porlier's book offers a brief overview for the layman who knows little. Unfortunately, there are still many people who are completely oblivious to this impending problem; And unfortunately, these are the people who will, most likely, exacerbate this problem when Jan. 1, 2000 finally arrives and the ignorant are not prepared. He introduces peacful strategies for dealing with the uninitiated and unequipped among us (and there will be many) like bartering and services rendered in exchange for food and other necessities. Most of us, children of the computer age, have no idea what life would be like without technology and regardless of the differing opinions of those supposedly 'in the know', we should all be prepared!"
3,Doesn't fit my 3 ring binder!,"I needed this so I could keep all my avon invoices in a binder all together and I was VERY disappointed that the holes punched don't line up with the rings on my binder! I'm not sure how that even happens! I have to pull the paper down and essentially rip the top two holes slightly so that it will make it into bottom hole! I am giving it 3 starts since it does punch the holes well, I have been able to do about 10 sheets BUT you have to punch it a few times in a row to make sure it went through all the way around. Overall, I wish I had chosen a different one."
4,Adjustable 3-Hole paper punch,"Adjustability makes for use to punch different spacing requirements for 3-holes on any paper size up to 11"". Easily punches through up to 6-pages for me. Strong, well made. I deduct 1-star because punched hole debris caught in the bottom can fall out if not kept upright position. Otherwise, no complaints."
3,OK,"Punches three holes like a total boss. Whenever I need to have holes in my paper, I just slam on this thing and BAM there they are.HOWEVER, doesn't handle multiple sheets well, and I would say it's a little stiff. WORSE OF ALL the holes don't fit/line up with any three ring binder I own. SERIOUSLY SWINGLINE GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER."
5,Simply essential reading for labor-side representatives!,"This text gives us an impossibly clear overview of labor laws from labor's perspective. The sections on organizing and the legality of different kinds of strikes are particularly helpful. A must-read for all BA's, Organizers and Union Officers. --Michael Murphy, Washington College of Law (formerly of Food and Beverage Workers Union, Local 32)"
5,"Different versions, so do your homework!","...apparently this Mr.Hansen promo was released in different versions with variant tracklists, yet with the same cover image, ha!!.......Diamond In The Sleaze was the song i HAD to have, so i asked several sellers for track listing (some didn't know what i meant, others never responded) and eventually i located the CD of my quest......unbelievable the caliber of material that never made it onto the Mutations album!"
5,"Great product from Brittany, France","Most greatest French Chefs have been using this ""Fleur de sel finishing salt"" on their creations including on chocolate desserts. Sprinkle it on the dish just before serving. Enjoy!"
5,Neil Gaiman is amazing,"Read Sandman in order. Don't buy the one that has the highest rating. This one is my favorite. Dream is an amazing character. The art is wonderful. The stories are so somber and eloquent. Neil Gaiman makes me want to be a writer and at the same time realize that my writing is awful in comparison. So I'll be an accountant instead, but these graphic novels are still very amazing."
5,You know when you like a story so much...,"... that you desire you had never heard it, so you could be taken again by surprise ? Well, the thing about these Sandman graphic novels is that after reading one of them, you get this sensation. The good thing is: there are 10 others !!! I've just finished this ""A Game of You"", and I am so glad I have 5 more to go !!!"
4,The best story/art combo in whole series (IMHO),"Well, lotsa people read the book and felt dissapointed, esp. the ones who loved Seasons of Mist. IMHO, this story is something that should've been published under different title or like A Game of You mini series, because it shows very personal journey of Barbie in her childhood. Dream of Endless appears just to justify a title :) Art is great and suits the story perfectly, while story itself represents a complete little psychoterapeutical insight into childhood inner schizm of main character and journey into a part of someone's psyche. If you're new to Sandman, start w either Brief Lives or Seasons of Mist, my friend's common favorites. Otherwise, if you're a vet Sandman reader OR a MAXX fan, pick this one up and enjoy !!!"
3,"Not the best Sandman, but still stellar","This interesting entry in the Sandman canon has great moments, fascinating artwork and the trademark Gaiman inventiveness all his fans have come to enjoy. However, the all-over story is as magical as some of the others in the series (particularly Season of the Mists, Brief Lives and World's End).I couldn't give it a five, because not everything can get a 5! Even a dynamic as this volume is. It's a must for anyone thinking of buying the entire hardcover set, because unlike most comics the Sandman is one large complete story that needs to be read in order (as it is there is a volume of onoe-shot stories that don't fall in any particular order within the continuity, per se).All in all, A Game of You will dazzle and delight in its own unique way."
3,Maybe it's me.,"Sandman is an excellent comic series. You'd be silly not to read every volume possible. Unfortunately, this volume just turned me off. I get what folks are saying about gender, but honestly, the plot just feels like a mess. Who's going where and why and how. What the hell is that cuckoo thing? Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the moron."
2,Disappointed,I was under the impression that the pillow insert was included but I recieved the fleece cover only. I have purchased these pillows from Turfer before and would have gone to the site and purchased one instead of paying $12.98 for just the cover including shipping charges. That is a is a bit much! Now I have to find a travel pillow that will fit in the cover. Not very happy!
2,Empty Shell,"Dimensions are approximately 11"" x 16""Nice fleece shell. But arrived empty, no stuffing?????"
2,inept,I don't have this and will not buy it.How is it possible not to give dimensions and no explanation of your product at all - does it inflate or what!?Maybe they do not really want you to know what SIZE it is.amazing....
1,"Great Novel, Terrible Edition","As for the story, those familiar with Marryat know what to expect, and this novel delivers; those new to his writing are in for a treat. My complaint isn't with the novel, but with the edition itself. This isn't a ""real"" book with binding, but that's okay; the price is right. The problem, though, is that the print is very, very light. I've bought four of Marryat's novels from this same publisher, and every copy is the same -- the type is so light that it's almost illegible. So do read Marryat, by all means, but I'd strongly suggest buying a different edition. I'd have returned these except that they're quite large -- 8/12 x 11 -- and so it would have cost more to return than the refund. Anyway, enjoy Marryat, but buyer beware..."
3,Must read if you want to read book 3,it was okay... a little different from the first one. i spent the whole time waiting for the main event and it all happened so fast in the last few 100 pages that i was disappointed. but luckily had the third book waiting in the other room and i could rush over to start reading it.
2,compared to the other books...,"having read the other two books of Rhiannon's Ride, and the Witches of Eileanan Series, this book is the worst of both series. The plot really does go almost no where. Yes of course there are major, very exciting developments, but they're scattered between pages and pages of nothing. Forsyth's writing and style are up to par, but i didn't find the plot as enjoyable as all the rest"
2,What was the author thinking?,"The 530 pages of this book are filled with total misunderstanding of everything around every character. A future mother-in-law is so obsessed with what she wants to believe she sees nothing of reality, a silly young man with alleged magic ignores the fact he is suddenly head-over-heals with a girl he previously thought of as a sister, and an obviously evil king is allowed free reign. I sincerely hope book three is better than this.The first book was entertaining. This book is a perfectly example of an author out of control. It is awful. I gave it two stars for continuity not enjoyment."
1,Loads of Crap,"When I ordered the Tour Grade TGGS36 Guitar Stand with Tripod Base the review stated it was a good Banjo and Guitar Stand... Turns out that it is pretty much useless... I don't know what I can use it for. But, it don't work as a guitar or Banjo stand. When I place my Banjo on the stand it slips off and it just don't hold it in place. My Ovation Guitar won't stay on the stand either... So basically, I have a stand that is for what? Either of the instruments won't stay on the stand without falling off. Oh well, buyer beware... Live and learn... You know what they say... ""You get what you pay for""..."
3,Lindos pero...,"Son unos lindos zapatos, pero son de terciopelo y supongo que serán muy fáciles de ensuciar, además el material es bastante rigido. En la foto se ven mejores de lo que son en la realidad"
2,These shoes are too hard!,"These handsome shoes are not leather-flexible at all; they are rather stiff, hard and not comfortable."
1,Zen Reflections Juniper Bonsai,"I received this as a gift. Someone said 'the perfect gift for someone that has everything'. Well, if they 'have everything' but not a Bonsai it probably means that they DON'T WANT ONE. It needs care-take it inside/outside water it even feed it. I dislike gardening and I don't keep plants. It seemed well packaged, but arrived broken right down the middle of the pot. I slso received the pot with the Chinese fisherman-I hate oriental decor. I dislike being ungrateful about a gift, but what should I do with it now? Don't give anything that needs ongoing care."
3,Care instructions?,"This looks exactly like the picture, but it got very drab very quickly despite watering it. I would research better care instructions."
1,Save your money,"Wow. Where do I start... Looks nothing, and i mean NOTHING like the picture. More like a twig in some dirt. Theres no nice, full looking foliage. Its more like a weak strand of green buds. I knew the pot would be different, but every character that was on it was broken upon delivery. It was wrapped in saran wrap and placed on its side? There wasn't even an arrow or sticker on the box saying ""this side up. It was a gift... I dont know what to do now. This is a joke. I will NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN. PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED. TOTAL FRAUD."
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!,This is the worst product I've ever bought!! This product came with nothing attached I had to re-glue everything back on. It looks nothing like the picture and is very poor in design and cheap looking. Do not buy this product I repeat do not buy this product! You will regret your decision tremendously!!!!
2,Dead Bonsai,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, because he had an interest in getting a bonsai at the time and we lived 5 hours apart. The plant arrived, and soil was everywhere in the packaging, however, that was to be expected. But then the bonsai began to develop brown leaves, despite watering it and giving it sunlight. He took it to a bonsai specialist, who told him the bonsai was dead. Pretty unfortunate. Not satisfied."
2,would not buy again,"The plant came quickly and looks very nice, but not as pictured. In the instructions it says never let soil dry out not even once, of course there was not a drop of moisture in the soil. Watered plant and it seams to be ok...we will see. The pond looks great, but it leaks into the soil portion of container and then out the drain hole, leaving pond empty in about an hour. Not to mention the nice big puddle on your coffee table. I will try caulking to solve problem...Bottom line not worth the hassle."
1,no sastisfecho.,"estoy desepcionado me enviaron otr producto diferente al que muetran en la foto. el bonsai que me enviaron es de una calidad mas baja y mas barato,estoy descepcionado."
2,Not as pictured,"Tree was in OK shape, but the root system was condensed greatly inside the tiny pot. The attached characters border on cheap, and the ""pond"" leaks profusely. Complained and was contacted immediately. Requested a refund but had some difficulty receiving."
3,"Great tree, but setting not like photo","The tree is great and very healthy, but the setting is not what is in the photo. It is a scene with a fisherman, bridge, etc. It is very cute, but we wanted just a simple setting like what is shown in the photo."
2,Received Broken,"When my son received this gift, the bowl was broken. I told him to call the company, but he hasn't done that yet, so I don't know what the resolution is."
2,Obviously damaged,When I received this product the bonsai was smashed into the pot so that it broke part of the pot and damaged the bonsai I had to replant the bonsai. I don't think any time or care was put into shipping or presentation of this product. Dissappointing.
3,"Tree Great, Pot Broken","First off, I'm incredibly happy with the health and look of my tree. I was surprised on how it maintained it's trip during transit and did end up looking a lot like the photo.My pot looks even better than the photo, but it won't hold any water. I can't tell where the leak is. My assumption is that there is a crack that allows the ""pool"" to enter the soil, and then the overflow-opening at the bottom just gets rid of all the excess, which looks to be all of it. So I cannot hold any water in my ""pool"" area what so ever.Just going to have to live with that, but everything else is great."
4,My Bonsai tree sent from Amazon.com,I love my little Bonsai tree. I have never had one before and it particularly special because I live in a condo now and no longer have a garden. I shall follow the instructions for its care and keep my fingers crossed that it will survive. When spring comes I will put it outside on my deck.The bonsai tree died! I believe the Japanese people are better at this than I am.
4,Japanese Zen/Bosai Tree,"Beautiful Japanese tree is a priviledge to own,as it arrived in great condition and had its own little pond of water."
1,I DID NOT LIKE IT!,"The picture shows a decent size juniper lone tree sitting tranquilly by the `pond'; in contrary, I received a tiny tree buried by many and cheap decorations with stuffs (mostly made by plastic and clay). The one I received does not look at all like a bonsai (or it looks different from the one in the picture); honestly I received an oriental plant (mixed) arrangement that I have once seen in the local China town. The container looked cheap and leaking! This item was purchased for my father, but I changed my mine - I would be too embarrassed to present it as a gift; the tiny puny tree did catch my 4 year old son attention for a few days though."
1,I wouldn't buy,"It had a little brown area when it came, which spread over time, and it died about 3 months after I bought it. I don't recommend."
1,Poor Quality,The bonsai didn't match the one in the picture and came with all kinds of little plastic pieces attached to the vase. It definitely wasn't what I wanted and the plant was not in good shape when I got it.
3,Mileage will vary,"Had I seen what I was getting ahead of time I probably would have not purchased this plant. I suppose this is not something you can't mass produce so what you get may or may not fulfill your expectations. My Bonsai was packed with Styrofoam ""peanuts"" which went all over the place when I opened it. Despite the packing there was some damage to the little fisherman and his pole. The plant itself is little more than a single twig bent at an angle and really does not resemble a miniature tree unless you apply a lot of imagination. Judging by the pictures, I gather you may luck out and get a nice looking one so before you order, you have to ask yourself, are you feeling lucky? One other thing, the little ""pond"" does not hold water. There were no instructions on caring for it but my daughter gave me some tips. I mist it several times a day and it seems to be healthy enough, just not that much to look at relative to what I hoped it would be."
5,Tremendous Trees!,Zen Reflections Juniper Bonsai is a great addition to any room in your house. I bought mine to accentuate my asian-themed bedroom and I am thoroughly satisfied. Thanks!
5,Exactly what I was hoping for!,I chose expedited shipping and it arrived in 9 days. The bonsai is exactly what I was hoping for. It's very healthy and still growing (the leaves on top are a bit lighter than those at the bottom). The package was protected with a huge amount of foam peanuts and the base was wrapped in a lot of plastic wrap/tape. The tree itself wasn't wrapped (but was underneath all the peanuts). I will update this review if any conditions arise that would change my review.
5,Great service and care for purchaser,"Everything was wonderful and i am enjoying my new bonsia tree, everything was what i expected. it came all together and on time. :)"
2,Not the best but will do,I bought this specifically for the reflection pond - that I found out does not hold water. I had a huge mess on my office window sill 10 minutes after putting in the water. If it was meant to leak - I think a ceramic or plastic base/saucer should have come with it. Since the shape is so odd I had to improvise by placing black rocks in reflecting pool. Because of the shape of the dish I am having a hard time finding something to sit it on to catch the excess water as I only fill the pool to water the bonsai.
3,"Healthy tree, crappy pot","Like other reviewers I unexpectedly got a pot that had a fisherman and a little house, which are both of decent quality. However the reflection pond itself cannot hold any water and leaks horribly. I really only bought this option for the decorative pot, so having a leaky pot is a bummer. The company did not respond to any inquiries, so I suppose I'm stuck with a leaky and visually unappealing pot until the tree needs repotting in several years.Luckily the tree itself seems to be in good shape and seems to have been well cared for. It is substantially younger than those pictured, but carries plenty of potential."
3,Won't hold the water,"This was nicely packaged and shipped pretty quickly. The actual tree looked pretty good, very green. The pot that is suppose to hold water though, doesn't at all and it leaks all over the place. The guys hand isn't big enough either so I had to put a hole in it to hold the fishing pole."
3,Won't Hold Water,"Well it arrived and looks very nice. When I opened it there is a little lantern glued onto part of it that was unstuck but that wasn't a big deal. Also the little fisherman's string was all tangled up, and with all of the extra slack not attached to anything I think one of the small fish may have been missing (I saw 2).None of that is really a big deal and the product overall looks pretty nice. My only concern is that the ""pond"" does not hold water. The water had drained entirely within 30 minutes through the hole in the bottom of the pot and into the dirt. I don't think this was a design feature for watering it because the instructions say to submerge the pot in and inch or two of water for X amount of minutes to water the plant."
5,My wife loves this stuff,I have been getting this for my wife for several years and she is very happy to receive it. I get it on Amazon because it is half the price of retail.
5,Must Have For Flash Fans,"This graphic novel is fantastic. It realy opens up the world of Wally West. After the loss of his two children, thanks to Zoom, Linda leaves him and it drives him crazy. This is a must have for all Flash fans. It also ties in with Identity Crisis which is pretty cool. Trust me, if you love Wally West as The Flash, just pick this one up. I also reccomend, ""Rouge War"" and ""Blitz"" Here's the best way to read these stories in order.1. Blitz2. The Secret of Barry Allen3. Rouge WarIf you pick them up all at once, you'll have a good 500 page read ahead of you. And it will be sooooooooo worth it."
1,Not for your entry level nursing student,"This book is great if your studying nursing at a Master's Degree level and the emphasis of your learning is on pathophysiology. Otherwise don't even bother with this text, it repeats itself with information every few paragraphs or refers you to other chapters when discussing a particular disease process. Unless you've had organic chemistry and some upper division biology, and bio-chemistry classes, this is not the text for the beginner. The tables are confusing, and once again the use of diagrams is overwhelming to the beginning nurse. I strongly reccomend that if your going to purchase this book, you buy it used, it's not worth the money new."
4,An excellent phone!,"I went from a Motorola RAZR, to the T519. My main reason for ditching the RAZR were the following: It's slow when it comes to doing simple tasks in the menu, and the web browsing is painful. I also didn't enjoy the display on the RAZR.For the T519: PROs+ Excellent display+ The browser will attempt to display anything you throw at it, and generally accomplish.+ Quick operation when going through the menus, etc.+ Good call quality+ Very slim and stylish+ Built wellCONs:- The directional pad/""back button"" are in a bad location. Anyone with larger fingers will need to use their fingernails to hit the down arrow. YOU MUST play with a demo model before purchasing this phone. Some people are able to work around this, some not.- The camera quality isn't the greatest- The signal is a TINY bit weaker than my previous RAZROverall, I like the phone."
3,"great technology, terrible design","This is a pretty hot-looking phone, thin, elegant, with great features. I especially like the ability to import mp3 clips as ringtones. No more paying money for ringtones! It's almost a little too thin, though, as it can be hard to pick up off the counter because there's nothing to grab onto. The menu system is a disaster. It takes about 8 clicks to do anything, there's very little ability to customize, and worst of all, you can only see two numbers at a time when browsing the phone book. Can you imagine that? It's as though they had all these features they were trying to pack in, but didn't think at all about what it's like actually to use the phone. I'm crossing my fingers for a software update. It makes me appreciate my old Sony-Ericsson T610. That was a smart phone."
4,Good Phone a major fault,"I upgraded to the T519 and am satisfied enough with the good things to keep it. My BIG problem with this phone is using it outdoors in sunlight. Even with the display brightness at its highest setting, it cannot be seen. All functions of the phone are useless if they cannot be viewed on the display."
4,SGH-T519 features excellent,"I have had this phone for about 2 weeks. Although some reviews say the photos arent that good, this is true only in low light/indoors. Good quality in daylight. Bluetooth works great, I was able to transfer data (after conversion) from my Nokia 6610 backup to the Samsung phone. MP3's play well. Using the keyboard was a bit of a challenge, but I got the hang of it. The two cons I find are (1) Speakerphone is soft and (2) No handstrap attachment point."
2,Fragile!,"Pretty much everything about the various features of this phone have been debated in the reviews so I'll skip that. However, one thing that should be noted is that this phone is way too fragile. I recently dropped the phone off my desk, a height of not even 4 feet and the screen is utterly destroyed. I'm about to go attempt to somehow either get my money back on my phone or get it repaired. However, if a company is willing to make a phone that cheap, I have a feeling that they probably save money on customer service as well."
2,NO BLUETOOTH MP3 LISTENING--PER SAMSUNG!,"I got this phone thinking that I could go buy a bluetooth stereo headset and use it for voice calls as well as listening to MP3 music--wrong! Yes, you can use a Bluetooth stereo headset for voice calls, but you can NOT listen to MP3 music through your Bluetooth stereo headset. Not good news--I though that I had misread the description here incorrectly, but I actually got a T-Mobile Tech Support person to call Samsung directly and she confirmed it....So yes, you can listen to MP3s over the tinny little speaker in the phone or through the tinny little speaker on the MONO headset that is included with the phone--but not through a Bluetooth stereo headset... So why bother with this phone if you are like me and want to listen to your tunes in stereo and through a Bluetooth headset?"
3,Frustrated buyer,"Stop playing marketing games that force me to dig so deep to find a simple price for the Samsung T519. By all means, stop feeding potential buyers trash like: ""the price is too low to show""! I refuse to buy from anyone that plays such games. If you want to sell the item, give the price and other needed information up front so that potential buyers can make an informed decision."
1,WORST Phone ever HAD!,Let me WARN you. The battery life sucks. It usually last only 2 days and NO more than 3 days with less than 10 minutes talk / day. My other Nokia last 7+ days with the same usage.
4,My Samsung SGH T519,"I love this phone, it works GREAT. I haven't had any problems with it while i was taking. I find that the only problem is that it is to thin. I have a habbit of putting my phone in my back pocket, but once i sit down i think i will snap it in half, but I haven't yet. Other than that this phone is GREAT!!!!"
4,Worthwhile,"I enjoyed many of these stories, especially ""How Ireland lost the World Cup"", the excerpt from ""At Weddings and Wakes"" (one of my favorite books ever) and ""Famine Fever"". One story which bothered me, however, was ""the Map of Ireland"" by Stephanie Grant, is set in South Boston, where I live. She apparantly is not from South Boston, because she has made geographical errors (Gate of Heaven School and church are no where near the MaryEllen McCormack housing development). Ms. Grant should be aware that there are no projects in Gate of Heaven parish, but rather it is a solid middle class urban neighborhood!! We are not poor!! I wish people would stick to writing about what they know. You can't pretend to know a life that you don't. Otherwise, the stories are great and I think it was a great idea to put together an anthology of Irish-American women."
5,A GREAT SONG,"""SOMETIMES""(IMPORT SINGLE IS A GREAT SONG .THE 2ND SINGLE OFF THE 11TIMES PLATIUM ""...BABY ONE MORE TIME"". IT HAS THE RADIO EDIT ,A GREAT B-SIDE SONG ""I AM SO CURIOS"" ,AND A GREAT REMIX ""SOMETIMES"" (SOUL SOUNTION MID-TEMPO MIX) .THIS IS A GREAT IMPORT SINGLE AND YOU SHOULD GO PICK IT AT A GOOD RECORD STORE."
3,Gorgeous cover. Not so bad inside either.,"I am a Las Vegas junkie and as such purchased this book on Amazon. I mean, who couldn't purchase a book with such a cool cover.Unfortunately, I was hoping to read a real tour-de-force about Vegas; its people, its energy.... and particularly, to get a huge dose of vintage Vegas. Although all of these elements are present to varying degrees, the story is a bit too conventional, and the characters a bit too cardboard, for me to get really excited.That being said, it is very much in the ""coming of age"" (Bildungsroman) genre -- transplanted to Vegas. Kind of Dickensian. A little TOO much so. It is very self-consciously literate, culminating in the wince-inducing exchanges between the Casino Boss and the protagonist over ""that fella Gatsby."" Catch my drift?"
4,"Long and winding road, worth the wait","I judged a book by it's cover, and picked this off the shelf at my local library.And I am so glad that I did.A powerful, engaging coming-of-age story that eloquently details the story of two families tied together by history, love, responsibility and success. Although the twists and turns are occasionally predictable, the imagery and characters make up for it. Definitely recommended."
5,The Best of Tragedy,"Ordered & received this CD about a year ago. Very nice CD, music was all original recordings, which is what I wanted. I'm very satisfied with this purchase & would recommend."
4,Not all originals,"I love the old teenage death songs and was mostly pleased with this collection, especially since it contained ""Patches."" My only real gripe: ""Tragedy"" is the Fleetwoods version, which doesn't come close to the heartbreak of Thomas Wayne's vocals."
4,Ikkyu,"An informative and well written book, with interesting anecdotes and insight into the famous Japanese Zen masters Ikkyu and Hakuin."
1,Doesn't fit in the 2 compression tools I have,"I finally got around to re-cabling my setup and make custom cables so I don't have all the sloppy look. I really want these to work so I can get my A/V rack closer to the wall, but I couldn't get a good compression on them. The part that normally fits in them was too long and even after removing the more expensive tool's adjustable compression slug, it still wouldn't fit. If someone can point me at a specific compression tool that works with these I might update my 1 star review."
2,Gucci,"When I bought the same product at the store, the perfume was much better. Not sure if it is authentic"
4,A Great Product for the Price,"I tested this thing by sticking two cotton-balls inside it and then pinning it down underwater in my sink for like 12 hours...not a drop of water got inside. If you want to protect your iPod, get this product. The only downside(s) are that you can't charge it while it's in the case, you can't use the ""hold"" button while it's in the case, and it's a little on the bulky side... I would buy it again in a second."
3,too big,"definitely weather proof but made my nano much bigger and heavier...almost ruins the point of having a nano... on the other hand, i'm so klutzy it's good to have something i can stick my nano in and then throw into a beach bag without worrying too much... just heavy for running and such"
1,TERRIBLE CASE - BROKE MY IPOD,"Don't buy this case before reading this message. This is a terrible waterproof case. I used it once and for 5 minutes only!!!! I took it for my swimming lesson and in less than 5 minutes it drowned my ipod nano!!! I complained at the otterbox web site, but they didn't bother to answer me. DON'T buy this item. You will be waisting your money."
1,Be very CAREFUL about which generation you have!,This is conceptually one of the best products I have ever seen. I bought the wrong case - apparently we have (had) a 2nd generation nano. It flooded the first time we used it as the dimensions are just different enough that it didn't seal properly. Be really careful that you order the right one.
2,"horrible, user-unfriendly device","I bought 2 of them thinking I would be able to control my living room lights with my Logitech Harmony remote. They are both useless. Very hard to program, completely unintuitive, and often they go out of sync so that the lights randomly start dimming when I change channels or volume on my TV. Kinda spooky! The technology in theory is good, but very badly implemented. Stay away if you want to keep your sanity.I used one as a 'manual' dimmer for my christmas tree lights last year. This is the only reason for giving it 2 stars."
1,Not worth the wait to receive it,I bought this product to allow my HTPC to be able to turn on and off an accessory. I never even got that far. This unit blows its internal fuse on the second or third use. I've replaced the fuse three times and it continues to blow without anything even plugged into it!
3,Take in small doses,"Not the strongest title in this series, the music on this CD is a bit too frenetic for background music, too obscure for casual fans of Latin exotica. This CD is certainly enjoyable in measured doses, but 14 straight tracks of ping-ponging stereo bongos and timbales can be a bit wearing. Since Amazon hasn't listed the performers, here they are (by track numbers) : 1. Augie Colon, 2. Miguelito Valdez and His Orch. with Machito and His Afro-Cubans, 3. Xavier Cugat featuring Lina Romay, 4. Yma Sumac, 5. Hugo Montenegro, 6. Perez Prado, 7. John Buzon Trio, 8. Lenny Dee, 9. Orizaba and His Orch., 10. Richard Hayman, 11. Sir Julian, 12. Hugo Montenegro, 13. Belmonte and His Afro-American Music, 14. Duke Ellington. Spectacular cover, by the way."
4,Excellent digital system,"This is an incredible peice of digital equipment and has more features than the space shuttle. It is most definitely a camera for a younger man however because it's HEAVY, especially with the 70-200 f/28 mounted. I can't imagine lugging around the really LONG lenses. I wore it around my neck for an entire day during a recent shoot and conlcuded that it would be best used in a studio environment on a tripod, or at least a monopod. I have owned several 35mm film cameras and at least seven different digital cameras including Kyocera, Epson, Olympus (2 different models, C2500L & E-10) and finally three Canons: the EOS 1Ds 11.1mp, the Powershot G7 10.1mp, and now the 5D 12.1mp. So far the last two have been the best for my purposes. The quality of course is in the glass, but the artistry is up to the photographer and so far Canon has delivered the very best I could hope for. EOS is an awesome system and the 1DS, aside from the weight is one of the very best."
2,Not what I expected,"My perception buying this book was of a historical fiction. This is just fiction, only the names are real. If you like Errol Flynn movies this'll make you happy, but is otherwise rather boring and uniformative."
4,As advertised,Product is exactly as described. It does a nice job of protecting the Treo. One main benefit is that it no longer slips out of my shirt pocket when I lean over. Easy access to all buttons.Delivery was quick.
2,An OK product... but could use some improvements,"When I finally received this product, it was exactly as described. I have a Palm Treo 700w from verizon. It fits in the case perfectly... but a little too perfectly. Its just tight enough it stays on but its just loose enough that it tends to slide from side to side. This makes it hard to maintain functionality of the palm device while in the case. I have had these cases for other devices (PDAs, Phones, iPods, etc..) but have always found them to be on the tighter side so that they don't do this. It can be a pain because I have to constantly readjust the case when I am talking on the phone because the speaker gets covered up.All in all.... if you are looking for a silicone case for your palm treo... this probably wouldn't be my first choice unless you are going for the lowest cost you can find."
4,"The Enemy Within: Intelligence Gathering, Law Enforcement, a","It was enlightening. I love books that push you to think and analyze, even after you put it on your book shelf. The Enemy... did just that. I suggest any analytical minded person to read it."
5,Superb book - but what's this about no CD in the USA?,"This is among the best car books I've ever seen. The photography is all new - no recycled press photos you've seen over and over. The writing style is clear and evocative of the best story telling. It could have been published as 21 monthly articles in Road & Track. The tone is friendly without being silly. It contains technical information without getting hopelessly bogged down in minutiae. HOWEVER - as I was reflecting how cool it would be to download audio recordings of these cars in action (imagining a website) I read that the UK version comes with a CD! Why isn't this in the US version? As the Buddhists say, all suffering stems from desire... Now if I could only buy (and maintain!) my fantasy Chaparral and Ford GT-40 and Ferrari Daytona and Mini-Cooper S and Lotus 21 and Jaguar D Type and supercharged Bugatti and Porsche 911 and Cobra and Buell superbike..."
4,Great for beginner readers,"I bought this for my daughter who can manage lots of small words. This book is constructed so that it gives the child confidence in reading without lots of help. Each chapter introduces a new set of vocabulary words. The part that I really like is the review pages at the end of each chapter that test the comprehension of what has been read and that invite the child to consider how the story applies to his life. These have lead to some pretty great discussions with my daughter that I doubt I would have had otherwise. My only complaint is that the stories lack so much detail that my daughter often says ""But what happened in between?"" and ""It says that God punished them, but how?"" Even with that, though, this book is still a winner!"
5,Perfect Bible for early readers.,"My daughter loves being able to sit down alone and read Bible stories. Also, each story has questions and suggestions for the kids in the form of pictures that go along with the lesson."
4,Nice little Bible,This Bible has lots of pictures to keep the young reader interested. Stories are just the right length. End of each story has some questions to think about. Very impressive.
1,I'll Keep it short but unfortunately not sweet,"My Sunday School students found the stories in this particular children's bible very boring and unappealing. I found the stories to be poorly edited, to the point that they made little sense."
1,Great for young readers,This is a great early readers Bible....the 5 year old boy that I gave this book to was thrilled and his mom reads from it every night.
5,Excellent,"I purchased the Early Readers Bible for my kids and they loved it. All their friends at church loves it too. It provides clear reading for little kids, and I have recommended it to other parents."
4,PERFECT FOR 3-4 YEAR OLDS,"I AM A SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER FOR 3-4 YEARS OLDS. THIS BOOK IS PERFECT, IT HOLDS THEIR ATTENTION AND THEY LOVE THE PICTURES. THEY LOVE THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF EACH STORY."
5,Great for a beginning reader,"So far, I really like the stories, they're easy to read and I think that as we pick up on his skills, they'll be easy for him to read as well."
3,"Good, but... stories not long enough","Illustrations are nice and my 4 year old likes it. The stories are a little too short for me though. I think this is appropriate for an older toddler/younger preschooler. After each short bible story, there's a page of questions for discussion with your child. These are nice for reinforcement and good bedtime talk material."
5,Great for 1 st grade readers!,I bought this for my granddaughter. She can read it and really enjoy it.
3,Too brief,"This book contains short paragraphs of background information on each of the scriptures read in the Episcopal Church on Sundays. It's useful, but very brief. If you're looking for a quick prep for Sunday service, this is it, but if you want more depth, this is not the place to find it."
2,Out dated,This is a good read if you want to know how the Netsilik lived in the fifties and sixties but horrible if you want to know how they live today. The book offers lengthy discriptions that would have better the book if they were cut down to spare the reader horrible explinations. It offers a small explanation as to these people's lives but does nothing to make you picture them in your mind.
3,A.W.O.L.,I wanted to buy this book but it didn't happen. I don't have any way to review it since I didn't get it. I couldn't give the book any stars but that option not available. I still want the book; I know the author and his works and now it will rate five stars.
5,Superb!,"I bless the day that I stumbled on Barbara Trapido's work. I have just finished The Travelling Hornplayer for a second time, and it is just as wonderful. The characters are complete, and they way they flow from one to the other in the story is the work of an artist. Twists, tragedy, comedy, family, friendship--it's all there in a book of such seamlessly written prose. Read this book if you want a new novelist to treasure and a story that stays with you when the book is on the shelf. The Travelling Hornplayer is a stunning book."
3,"Starts strong, disappoints","The first chapter is terrific: Original, sensitively insightful, often witty. But the novel shifts, chapter by chapter, to the points of view of different characters who have slightly different perspectives on the same events, and unfortunately some of these characters are flimsily drawn and less engaging than the narrator of the first chapter. The multiple perspective device relies on way too many contrived coincidences and chance meetings, and any sense of suspense or freshness is lost."
2,An entertainingly written book with a poor ending.,"I found this book a most enjoyable read but I felt the conclusion was lacking. It felt truncated to me, hastily wrapped up. The plot, on the other hand, was complex and well written."
3,"Good case, toss the caribiner","Case is great. I drop it a lot, and the case is solid. The Caribiner is cheap and should be thrown away as soon as you get it. Almost lost the ipod twice because the caribiner disconnected."
5,"This song is so cool, I love the way her and Total mix!","This song is so cool, I love the way her and Total mix! She is the best female rapper since back when Salt N Pepa did Shoop! I think anyone should cop this cd!"
2,"It is yellow, not white.",I got this to hook up my mac mini. I wanted a white cable to blend in with everything else. What I got was a 1992 yellow cable that looks terrible.
4,Seems to work,This is actually a 14 pin cable. It appears that one pin is purposefully not included in this cable. You can see it in the picture even. Still seems to work though.
1,Damaged,"The unit I got has a weird burn mark on one end, and had burned into the cable where they were resting against each other. I have no clue how it got this damage, so I requested a refund, which hopefully will go through. Strangely though, Amazon doesn't want their cable back, so now I am stuck with a damaged cable that will have to go in the e-waste pile."
2,More Nordic instruction needed,My husband and I did not like this video. In our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage. I can't see how this type of product is useful to learning to nordic ski since there is no uphill or flat track technique.
1,Hate math? you'll hate this book!,"We are up to chapter 5 in this book so far. Several people in the class have had to take it over several times now. The book is too hard...at least for a lot of people it is. The concepts are not presented clearly. It can be very hard to correlate the example problems to the homework problems. Even with the student solution manual (which does not have every odd #, but every other odd #, heh) I am lost. A big group of us get together for a total of 7 hours per week working on our homework with tutors and they are even lost! AHHHH. This book is horrible! Good luck to all whom have to take this course!"
2,A travesty for the money,"The only reason I give it two stars is that the word problems and models are interesting and realistic. The student solutions manual is a rip-off because it does not model each type of problem, nor does it lend itself to greater understanding and clarification. I usually get straight ""A's"" in math courses because I pour all effort necessary into homework and understanding. I just find myself being frustrated every time I open this book. The examples in each chapter just give me a headache. It is assuming and poorly written. Colleges that require this book for courses in pre-calc and trig should think twice."
3,Miss American Family,"I've always thought that a good writer is supposed to SHOW you, not TELL you. This author bluntly tells you, again and again, what the characters are like. A good author lets you figure it out for yourself. I felt that the dialogue was unrealistic. People just don't talk philosophically non-stop."
5,A captivating look into the characters lives,"Juliana Baggot sure hit the nail on the head with this one. The story of the dysfunctional middle-class family is told from the standpoint of mother AND son, which contributes to its mesmerizing plot. While the family looks quintesential on the outside, the main characters are complex and sometimes bizzare. Ezra is coming into his manhood and questions his views on life, as well as his sexuality. Pixie is struggling with her own identity and having somewhat of what one would call a quarter to mid life crisis. The author follows a summer of milestones, heartache, laughs and sadness. This is definately a must read and hard to put down, as it leaves the reader wanting to know what's in the characters' thoughts and what will happen next."
3,not the best of the series,"This volume brings most of the pirate stories to an end and sets up the last events leading to the concluding volume and the end of the story lines. If you've followed the entire series, it's worth watching, but it's a bit of a letdown from the previous couple of volumes. It is nice to see the pirates mostly dismantled and particularly for Seiryo to get his comeuppance.(Spoilers ahead) I did not enjoy the idea that the Galaxy Police's Galaxy Army division could turn into a corrupt pack of thieves and that Seina and the girls were to be used as pawns in exposing their duplicity and in bringing them down. It was nice to see some more characters from Tenchi OAV 3, like Misao (Mihoshi's brother), Masishu (his wife), and the Chobimaru.After a little more reflection, this volume was not that good, but it wasn't that bad either. Fortunately, volume 8 is a blast, and it's really necessary to see 7 to understand what's going on in 8."
4,Fifties redux,"Beautifully remastered by Steve Hoffman, the DCC version of this CD offers an easy-listening picture into what swinging bachelors listened to during one of America's halcyon decades."
5,Truly outstanding,This latest biography of Eisenhower adds depth and understanding to this very complex man. His role as supreme commander in the European Theatre and as president is extremely well researched and well written. The character and foibles of the generals around Ike are presented in such a way that the reader feels he is in the same room. An excellent read.
4,A quick 600 pages,"Very well written, it lends itself to being read in a few days. It portrays Ike as a very complex and multifaceted man, much more than I had expected before reading it. I remember, not being able to wait until Ike goes to war in Europe. But actually the African Campaign is the most tedious reading in the book. The most entertaining part of the book, was the political intrigue of the presidency, which I enjoyed immensly. Still, I wish that there had been more about Ike's relationship with Nixon and more explanation of his mysterious final address, in which he spoke of the growing power of the military-industrial complex."
3,"Bland, a disappointment, but useful","Rather colorless writing, not even up to his earlier bio of MacArthur, but useful never the less, largely because of the interview material from John Eisenhower. Some new light on the relationship with MacArthur, very little new from the WWII period, and not up to the Ambrose study of the presidential years. In short, just not very original; he even closes the last paragraph as Ike dies almost verbatim from Ambrose's bio.Perhaps I have a somewhat jaded view here because I had a number of rather lengthy personal conversations with Eisenhower after he left the Presidency and I remember much more color and personality than this book portrays. It wont add very much to the story of one of the finest men of this sad century.One final comment: the Kirkus reviewer refers to the Eisenhower presidency as ""mediocre."" That is a comment in nitwiteracy and any historian today worth his salt would make a mockery of it."
2,Sloppy writing; shallow thinking,"This is a pedestrian narrative that focuses on what ""Ike"" DID rather than who he WAS. Relationships with Patton, MacArthur, Roosevelt and Churchill -- and Mamie -- are reported incoherently and the ""did they or didn't they"" discussion of Eisenhower's relationship with Kay Summersby reads like a bad National Enquirer piece. In sum, if you like the kind of biography written by Ambrose and Manchester you will be disappointed with Perrett's Eisenhower."
1,Vapid in the extreme,"I've long admired Ike and have dozens of biographies of him. The best is the two-volume study by Prof. Ambrose, which was a delightful read. This book is really quite bad. There are so many mistakes in it, I couldn' tbegin to count them all. Perret's attempts at trying to explain World War II and the European theatre were almost laughably comic. It was pretty clear he'd never read much about the War, or Monty, Patton, Bradley, etc. This is an anemically researched effort."
1,Another bad book from Perret,"Having studied Ike for 30 years, I am disappointed in this book from Mr. Perret. There are so many sloppy errors in this book. I don't understand why Perret didn't have Stephen Ambrose proofread this manuscript before sending it off to be published. Anyone who wants to know the real Ike will lose to Ambrose's books, not this inconsequential and vapid treatment. Perret specializes in shoddy biographies, like the ones he did on U.S. Grant and MacArthur."
2,Not worth buying,"I pretty much agree with the previous reviewer, Tim McCann. A shallow book. I wish I had saved my money and not bothered to buy this book."
1,Abysmal,"This is a truly poor book, filled with errors and mistakes. There is abslolutely no new information or any new insights into Ike. I was greatly disappointed in the lack of research and the sloppy writing."
2,Doesn't Hold Up Well,I bought the entire set for my 4 year's old birthday and it just didn't hold up. The pieces broke easily and it was frustrating for my daughter. I'd skip this one.
4,Helped us with Pottty Training,"I have always wondered what the difference between pullups and diapers were beside just being able to be pulled up. Cool Alert Pull-Ups from Huggies also have an ingredient that gives them the sensation of coolness when wet. These Cool Alert Pull Ups really did assist us in potty training because the cool alert makes him feel uncomfortable and he starting holding his potty. He was even waking up dry in the mornings. As soon as I put a regular diaper back on him, he went back to using his diaper. We will be ordering more of these. They differ from the package shown, they come with the CARS movie characters on them, which my son loves and makes him want to wear them."
4,Great transition from Diapers to Underwear,"We love these 'big-boy' pants!They are very absorbent for how thin they are. They won't hold as much as a diaper, which helps my son know how often he's going potty. They're not great for holding #2 so if your son doesn't alert you right away that he's stinky/dirty, you're in for a wardrobe change. This can be both a good and bad thing: good - he knows he's dirty and will learn when he needs to go; bad - the mess.They have adjustable sides if you have a skinny little one, but fit great on mine without any adjustment. He can pull them down by himself, and only needs a little help to get them up.I don't know if he's feeling the 'cool alert', but he loves that the picture changes and there are Cars on them.Amazon Subscribe and Save allows me to stay stocked on these at the best price I've found, including Costco and Walmart, either online or in-store."
3,Don't like the side closures!,"The only thing i didn't like were the side velcro closures.My son take off almost all the time,and i have to switched back to Pampers easy ups Training Pants.Don't going to buy ever again!Otherway Pull Ups are great."
1,hate huggies,"When I gave birth I had already bought packages of newborn huggies. They were horrible. I thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then. NOPE. I've tried Huggies Supreme and the cheap huggies. They are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them. I thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around. WRONG AGAIN. They leaked evertime he wore them. Do not waste you money. I always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers, cruisers, and training pants. Pampers are the best."
1,Too slow,I agree with the previous two reviews stated here. 512MB RAM is too slow for Windows Vista. One has to upgrade to AT LEAST 1GB RAM.
1,Very inefficient,The pc is very very slow and the Windows Vista system is giving me a headache. I received a product key for windows which isn't even working and its extremely difficult to contact hp. The configuration is not effiecient. It should at least be sold with more memory.
4,Some dissapointments,"While this is a pretty good book, there are some disappointments. About 60% of the 3000 aircraft have a one sentence description. Some of the photographs are more journalistic flash and trash. One example is showing the photo of the pilot of the Bell x1 instead of the aircraft. Another is from the rear of the aircraft instead of the usual, more informative top or side photo. It would have been helpful had the index had a section with the year of introduction. Without this you have to do an exhaustive read of the book to find which aircraft were from which era.Another problem with this book is its emphasis on European, especially English, manufacturers. Many highly successful US airplanes are not listed and minor English ones are."
5,Fun for kids and not boring for adults,"My two-year-old loves it and has been asking for ""Animals"" over and over again. It has great footage of real animals, mostly from National Geographic, without any scary scenes. The variety of musical styles in the songs that go with each letter help to keep him engaged."
2,Can't get 2 year old son to watch it,"I was very excited about getting this video because all of the reviews were so good. Unfortunately I cannot get my son to watch it. The music is somewhat annoying, almost like chants and some of the animals go on too long. The footage is great and if your child has expressed an interest in watching nothing but animals this would be a great video, otherwise good luck"
5,My Favorite!,"I started watching this video when I was 1 year old. (I'm 15.) It was my first and favorite. I even learned to put the video in and turn it on when I was 2. I highly recommend this video to any kid! My 1 year old sister has started watching it now and it is the only one she will sit all the way through! The songs are all very catchy (I remembered them for years) and the animal footage is all real. If you have little kids, this video is a must (and it's fun for everyone else too)!"
1,Poor Quality,"This is a beautiful piece, but unfortunately this toe ring snapped on the third wearing. I am very disappointed with the quality."
5,jim reeves number one song in 1966 was distant drums. it kno,"the number one song in 1966 was distant drums, an overdubbed demo recording that jim recorded as a demo in 1961 that chet atkins said wasn,t the right time to release that song because of the vietnam war. the songwriter was cindy walker and when she went to rcas studio with mary reeves and first heard distant drums she was totally shocked to hear an overdubbed version.cindy wrote songs especially for jim reeves as jim was her and the worlds favorite singer.enjoy the most beautiful voice god ever gave toa human being this song knocked the beatles off the top of the charts in britain and jim forever will be remembored as the man who beat the beatles"
1,Looking for the song Burning Bridges,Can anyone tell me an album of Jim Reeves that contains the song Burning Bridges? I can't find it on any of the albums listed here.
5,Sounds absolutely wonderful!,"I love this scent and bought it for a gift. It's quality stuff that lasts a long time. No need to use a lot, a small amount goes a long way."
4,A Sure Page Turner!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. From the time I picked up the book until I finished it, I was eager to learn what would happen next. The writing was very fluid, easy to relate to, and easy to envision. I laughed, cried, and was engaged throughout. I would highly recommend this book to any and every romance novelist. Monica and Preston are a great couple. Their love transcended the odds!"
2,I expected more,I was disappointed with this book. The story is very sad and depressing. There is a lot of killing and dying. Oliver is mistreated and blamed for things that he didn't do. There is only a little happiness in this book and it's in the end. It was interesting though.
4,Oliver Twist by Tommy Laubender,"Oliver Twist is a great classic for 9 year olds. It was very enjoyable because there was always action and I liked the old English and clothing. Although it was a little long, it was still a fun book. I felt bad for Oliver because he did not have enough food and he got bossed around a lot. This book would be interesting to both boys and girls. I would highly recommend this book."
3,Oliver Twist,There was a boy named Oliver Twist.When he was born his mother had died after giving birth to him. He had gotten treated poorly after his mother had died and was very sad. He was adopted to a business where they bury dead people. When he got to their house they put Oliver in a basement where there were coffins everywhere. You need to read this book because it will knock your socks off.
2,Mango rocks (literally),"I'd really like this granola if the mango chunks didn't have the consistency of rocks. Those little cubes are hard and unchewable. The cereal has whole almonds which are easily munched, but the mango pieces are not. I chew this one slowly and fear for my molars."
3,Very good but one caveat,"My first time trying this brand/flavor and it is very good! The nutrition numbers are similar to that of Bear Naked except this contains salt/sodium while BN does not. Also, while BN is quite soft this Mountain Madness is very crunchy. My only issue is that this includes rice which, I assume, is what makes it crunchy.Usually, when a company makes both granola and granola cereal the difference between the two is that rice is an ingredient in the latter and it is priced lower than straight granola. This product is labeled as granola not granola cereal and is priced and packaged as a premium granola.Again the flavor and crunch is good but just be aware of what you are getting and what you are spending for it.Because of that I am only giving it 3 stars though the flavor is 4-5 stars,"
5,A nice artbook.,"This book is filled with comics and artwork from various artists, with the artwork being quite varied from person to person. The comics are really quick, with the stories often being so surreal and ambiguous that you'll find yourself wondering what is going on most of the time. Also, if you're expecting a lot of Range Murata's work to be in here, you'll be disappointed. He has maybe 3 pieces in the entire book. But, if those two points aren't a bother to you, I recommend picking this up."
3,Great art.. but...,The stories are truly lacking. Sort of like the 'Heavy Metal' magazine without the possible chance of getting a decent story in it.Great artwork.That's it.
3,ehh,"this was not what I thought it would be. I have to admit that the only reason I bought it was because it is all in color, and i liked the name. its a bunch of different stories that are very strange. thats really all I can say, very strange"
3,bought during anime-expo 2005,"great artwork and illustrations, however when i bought this i left it in the car on the way home. when i took it out the book had managed to debind itself >.<. so if you buy the book watch out for the heat and take care to keep it away form any heat source..."
4,Great. Thanks.,Got to say I don't appreciate the huge ugly sticker in the bottom right of the cover whose removal left a permanent mark on my new book.
2,pretty good anime book,"to begin, the cover looks pretty darn good, but when you actually open the book, its amazing. The styles of each artist are great, they all have their own wonderful style, and the short stories are great as well...five stars, a must have for fans of any type of manga!!!"
4,Definitely worth reading,"I read this book when it was immediately available and ended up making photocopies of about a good chapter and sent said sections to several friends. I also encouraged these friends to read this book.The most useful part of the book were the talking points with your daughter about movies, items, commercials, etc.Overall, the book will be incredibly useful to parents, teachers, and others who work with youth. I think the book is insightful and it's written for a lay audience.I'd probably suggest that you check it out from the library (like I did) and then read it to decide if you think you should own a copy.It's a great book, but not as strong as _Odd Girl Out_, for instance. And, I made sure to buy that book."
1,Not worth it,"It was awful! I felt like it was VERY feminist, VERY slanted, and very repetitive. The authors kept saying the same thing over and over.One positive takeaway was to have open conversations with your daughters about what they are seeing, watching, and listening to, but the book is NOT worth the purchase."
5,Dean Martin's 'ITALIAN LOVE SONGS',"Was in Italy getting married and discovered we were missing our two ""Best of..."" albums. No 'Volare' after flying all that way? And how can you visit Napoli (where love is king) without a copy of ""That's Amore""? Well this album arrived on our wedding day - a godsend! Highly recommended."
4,Dino Singing Italian Now That's Amore,I can no longer eat spaghetti without having Dino `s Italian Love Songs spinning nearby. You will say Return To Me many times over to the CD
1,Dean Martin Italian Love Song.,"Can't rate this album as I was billed for it, but it was downloaded with the message""song not available"" for every song in the albumIt has been less than enjoyable trying to get my money refunded. I got the bill,but not the songs."
2,Italian? please!,"Hey, I'm a fan of Dean Martin. LOVE HIS VOICE! but the title is ""Italian Love songs"", where's the Italian? There's hardly an Italian word sung in these. Why as an Italian man, couldnt he have made some albums sung all in Italian language? Too late now, but I'd have loved that! These are too Americanized, hardly recognize them as Italian anymore, even if they were originally. Just my opinion everyone. If you're looking for a mood of being in Italy go to the Italian songs sung in Italian, but if you just want Dean Martin-well you got it. I gave it 2 stars, cause its NOT in Italian and they dont FEEL like LOVE songs to ME."
5,Magnifico!,"I bought this album to use as background dinner music at my wedding, and I received so many thanks and compliments from friends and family. I listen to this CD all the time and recommend it to all. The album is cohesive and engaging. It will put anyone in the mood for love!"
5,"Nice version with less orchestration, just his warm vocals","These songs are on other recordings with more background singers and instrumentals; but I liked this simple, soothing style better."
4,Dean Martin Italian Love Songs,Very good CD. Arrived in good condition and brought back a lot of memories of Dino. Arrived quickly.
5,Dino,This CD has all of the great Dean Martin songs that you may hear while sitting in an Italian restaurant. It is Dean Martin so it has to be good.
5,Italian Love Songs,Totally agree with Frank Sinatra -- when Dean Martin died on Christmas morning what a treat for the angels in Heaven!
4,Fantastic,The item was very good. I really liked it. It helped me in choosing the right product. Many thanks !!
1,Shipping takes Ages,I love Gucci Rush 2 but the problem is the Vendor. I have waited for almost a month just to recieve it.
1,Ignition coil,I am disappointed in the fact that i order and bought a Beck Arnley 178-8155 ignition coil and instead the seller sent me a bosch coil.This coil was sent in a beck arnley box. could you tell me why you people did this to me?
5,"O BRUXO (the sorcerer) returns, well, he never really left","It appears that after a long dry spell ,a creeping interest in Hermeto Pascoal has returned. Like most composer/performers of what I consider music (as opposed to quasi-musical entertainment as the mass market perpetrates),Hermeto is a hidden treasure. This cd, originally released in the early 1970's is a wonderful showcase of the multi-instrumental talents and the unique compositional style of the man I consider the world's greatest living composer. This cd showcases the trademark melding of northeastern Brasilian rhythms & advanced harmonic approach that makes Hermeto so unique, along w/ some avant guard and jazz-fusionsounds (Hermeto had been a sideman in Miles Davis' seminal electricbands ). This music demands your attention, and deserves to be heard. A welcome addition to the real music lovers collection, and a great start for one looking to expand their musical horizons! ENJOY!"
4,"Rich and Davis, '66","Exciting live recording, but Sammy sounds kind of tired and even a bit buried by Buddy and the band. There is little synergism, just each star kind of fighting for the spotlight. Still, well worth the price."
2,Are you guys nuts?,"The best Sammy CD? Are you kidding? I just spent $30 to hear a truncated (albeit totally swinging) ""Come back to me"". And ""The Witch is dead?"" You'd need to be a complete ding-dong if you can't find a better way to honour this man's legend. A waste o' time and money.Invest, instead, in ""Live at the Cocoanut Grove"" and truly experience just what Sam is all about. This cat swings with the best of them and, when he's loose, he's better than you can possibly imagine."
4,they really want to be black sabbath,"This band wants to be Black Sabbath in the worst way. Which if you're a Sabbath fan (which I am) is not a bad thing. The guitarist...Bruce Franklin is incredible and if you want to hear him on an awesome CD, pick up ""Supershine"" with Dug Pinnick from King's X! A good show and a decent recording. Make sure it will play on your player or computer before purchasing though! If you're power cord hungry, this is a DVD that will curb your appetite for awhile."
2,Skimpy,I thought this book was longer than it is and have more insight into the outcome of one's painting. I guess I was looking for more of an interpretive book.
4,A COUPLE OF HOURS OF ENJOYMENT,"Many moments of enjoyment. Quite a few laughs. Many corny lines by some has been virtual unknowns or perhaps a more applicable statement may be, a visit to some D list actors/actresses. Johnny Brown (Good Times'-book man,buffalo butt) Is still acting. The characters' lines are amateurish, lame and unfunny for the must part, yet the storyline does culminate by sending a serious message that saves this movie. A comedic approach to a serious and somewhat profound subject that I therefore recommend."
1,Silly & Slow,I didn't enjoy this movie. I thought is was silly. I started to return the dvd and get a refund.
1,Terrible,"When I read the synopsis, I was excited, because I could totally relate to the feeling ""I'm through with white girls"", and as far as I know it hasn't been done before. But it turns out the title was just for shock value. The opportunity for commentary on the pitfalls of black/white relationships was squandered. We don't actually get to see the main character in any sort of relationship with white women. Instead this movie is about the main character's insecurities and fear of commitment.And that HAS been done, too many times, and usually better than this. This film can be summed up with one line from the script: ""It's not about color or class...and you know it."" Except you know, when it's about ALL of those things. Apart from it not being as advertised, or what I wanted it to be, it's just not a good film in its own right - trite characters who play to extremes, no depth, and not funny at any point, which is the least I've come to expect from a comedy."
2,"How about ""I'm through with black girls""","How about a movie titled ""I'm through with black girls."" Or ""I've had my fill of Asian women."" Or ""I'm tired of Hispanic chicks."" The title is both sexist and racist, and it wouldn't be tolerated by any other ethnicity, would it?"
4,Good twist,"Funny, It was great to see the male finally realize, its not the womans fault. The woman he ends up with, was really good. Never have seen her in any other films."
5,Unexpectedly Hilarious,"OMG, what a great movie. I recommend it for non-stop laughing. But, only for those who have a sense of humor!"
5,Significantly less dust than Mustang Brembo pads!,"First off, the image is wrong. This part number is for the yellow box ceramic pads and that is indeed what I received. After 500 miles I have no issues with braking. Stopping feels comparable to the brembo pads that came with my '12 Mustang GT, but I no longer have to clean my aftermarket wheels every 2 days! Highly recommend to anyone looking for the same stopping power but with less mess."
3,Like a TV series chapter,"The story describes a mission assignment of a group of mecha girl pilots.Let say it straight. 30 minutes is quite little time to build a drama. Well, it has some, not outstanding or deep but considering the time available it is enough. The story starts open and ends open.The music is practically absent. Except for some Mazinger style music in the action sequence, it is just animations and voices. Anyway the music is poor.It is not good, not impressive, not a must have, just a modest series like chapter of some sort. No art portfolio at the end of the movie."
1,Built Terrible,"This bag has been nothing but a problem since purchased. First the legs kept coming apart, which I was able to fix. Today, the strap pulled out of the bag. I am not happy with this purchase."
1,Not so Happy Birthday,"All my son wanted for his 4th birthday was a red guitar with a shoulder strap. I found this one and thought it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it arrived with a large scratch on the front and with 2 strings that can't be tightened. I wasn't expecting him to actually play a song on it, but I also didn't expect it to arrive damaged. Beware!"
5,A Fascinating True Story,"I am a New Yorker who reads on the subway commuting to the office. On two occasions I missed my stop because I was so engrossed in ""Magda's Daughter"".This book is a tale of human adaptation and resilence. When I finished the book I was in great admiration of Ms. Blaikie. She is a woman of strength and insight.It certainly made an impression on how lucky I was to be born in the US after the war and reminded me of the immense suffering caused by the Nazis and the horrendous consequences of the Holocaust.Thanks for such a good read. It was a pleasure to get to know Ms. Blaikie."
5,WD-800AAJS-Sata,I bought 2-drives for the SYS C:/drive on 2-desktops/just to add a fresh product line--previously I had WD-800AAJD 80-GB/these went in perfectly and my 2-OS's loaded exactly..even more easily than with the old HDD(800JJAD)..which has been XP or Vista OS's..excellent price..Western Digital is my preferred product for SYS. C:/drive.
5,"Good hard drive, works just fine",Purchased this drive to replace the Seagate that crashed which contained my OS! So far it is doing what it is suppose to do and I hope that it stays that way.
3,80Gb not 1TB.,I almost bought 4 for a NAS setup thinking it was 1TB for a great price. Turns out to be only 80GB drives when I went to check whether it is on my NAS drive compatibility list. Amazon needs to correct the title.
2,Not the usual Lisa,"I was very dissappointed in this new CD. There is not much real bossa nova rhythm in this CD, just mild hints of it. And some tunes are nowhere close to bossa. I prefer here fantastic earlier recordings that contains real hard core bossa nova. NK"
2,Mailing it in,"This does not live up to the quality of the other Wallender books, its a true disapointment. Wallender is revealed in this book as a wife beater, subject to frequent fits of rage, to go along with his other revealed qualities as an overweight diabetic who won't go to the doctor. We get to know his daughter Linda--a disrespectful brat you would not want to meet anywhere, who appears to have wandered aimlessly through life, achieved nothing, and now thinks she is better than everyone she meets, including her father, who she torments with her monumental ego.Mankell mailed this one in--I'm half way through the book and can't bear to read another page."
5,I hope he keeps writing Wallander Thrillers,I read all of Mankells Mysteries with Inspector Wallander and this one as well is just mesmerizing and fascinating. Mankell spins a net out of actions and hints you just can't wait to find out why and how.... I missed my train stop 3 times because I couldnt stop reading! Love Love Love - please more!!!
1,not what I was expecting at all,"I was searching for a an exciting thriller, a fast paced page turner, and even though this book was recommended to me based on my preferences, it was not at all what I was expecting. I found it very slow to start, and never really got rolling for me. Very disappointed."
1,Disappointed,I love all the Kurt Wallander books and really looked forward to this one. The storey was confusing and weak and reading this book was like drinking an extremely diluted cup of coffee.
2,"Slow, Ponderous Plus Change to Daughter Unsuccessful","This is a Wallander mystery but the WRONG Wallander. It is an attempt to shift the main character from the aging Kurt, star of all the other books, to his daughter Linda. Linda is not an interesting character. She is now thiry and starting out at Kurt's station herself. She is worried because a friend of hers, Anna, has seemingly disappeared. While trying to find Anna, she and her father wander into a hut which has the severed hands and head of another woman. This should ratchet up the pace and action of the book but it does not.There is a tremendous amount of interior dialogue in this novel. When it is Kurt having this soliloquies, it is ok. When it is Linda, it is boring. The dialogue in this book is the weakest aspect of the book with the leaden pace coming a close second. I can't recommend this book. The author is taking a step in the wrong direction with Linda as the lead character."
2,Not up to Mankell's earlier standard,"In an effort to introduce Wallender's daughter Linda as the new, thoughtful and aanalytic Wallender, Kurt Wallender's character is changed, he's not the calm, introspective Wallender we've come to know and like. I have the feeling the book was written too fast, not very carefully (this is my 13th Mankell mystery). By page 223 I was ready to quit, the plot is too boring, and that's the second time this has happened with a recent Mankell book (Italianske Sko). I still recall being glued to his 5th mystery, which I read first. I also particularly liked the Return of the Dancing Master (not a Wallender mystery) and Firewall. I admit to having read no Mankell in English yet, have read them all in Norwegian, German, or Swedish. The Norwegian is of course closest to the original text.This review is based on the Norwegian version Fr Frosten."
3,Disappointing Characterisation,"I am a great fan of the Wallender novels,primarily because of the interesting central character,as well as the taut plots.This being detective fiction,one can happily ignore the unlikellihood of it all.This is especially true of Mankel's work in fact:I don't have the figures in front of me,but I have no doubt that rural Sweden where Wallender operates must be amongst the most low-crime places on Earth!Novels featuring religious extremism are topical,as such extremism is perhaps (well,after climate change) the greatest threat to society today,whether it comes from extremist Christians or extremist Muslims.Where the book falls down somewhat,I feel,is in Linda,the great detective's daughter,Leaving aside the unlikelihood of her joining the same police team and same police station as her father (surely this would not be allowed),she comes across as an uninteresting,weak-minded and not very thoughtful character.This is in marked contrast to her father."
3,Good book to ge more Kurt Wallander,"The book was OK, but Linda' character was a little weak. Best part of the book was really more insight into Kurt's personality."
2,Missed the Mark Totally,"I was very disappointed in Before the Frost. I found Mankell's writing to be stilted, forced even. Linda's character was so annoying and bratty that she was not fun to follow through her rookie days. I also was disappointed with how easily Mankell sold the descriptions of his other well established characters up the river through Linda's immature eyes. All of a sudden Ann-Britt wears too much make up and tight clothes? I don't know if Mankell was trying to do some kind of character study, but he lost me. Unless he allows Linda to mature and not have stupid friends and throw ashtrays, then I will consider pickin up the next novel. But my advice to those who have not read this: don't read it because you will miss Kurt Wallander as if he were dead."
1,linda wallander,"This is my first Mankell book. And although i am not finished with the book , i find that i am barely able to keep reading , as the characters and story are so poorly written. There are a lot of good reviews for this book . And i just dont see it."
2,before the frost,I have enjoyed the many books I have read by Henning Mankell but I really disliked the thought of swans on fire amongst other things in the this particular novel. Sorry not my cup of tea.
3,Wallander and daughter are revolting people.,"I have read everything that Mankell has written.The plot is very very suspensful. Wallandar and his daughter are portrayed as two of the most unlikeable, revolting people I have have come across as detectives. Everything about them is distasteful and their disfunctional relationship totally took away from my enjoyment of what is a fascinating mystery."
2,Is this even written by the same author?,"I've read all but one of the Kurt Wallander novels, and this one reads like a first draft written by someone else. The characters and their relationships, so well established after eight novels, is just way off here. The writing is rough and various inconsistencies were not smoothed out. There's nothing to blame on the translation, it's got to be flaws in the original. Book one and four through seven were strong, and I liked the recent prequel as well, but the rest not so much, and this one is the worst of the bunch."
4,Linda Wallander's debut,"Linda, daughter of the infamous Kurt Wallander, star of several Mankell novels, has just graduated from the police academy, and is a few days away from starting her job at the police station her father works at when her friend Anna disappears.As she tags along with her father on an investigation, it soon becomes obvious that Anna's disappearance and a woman's murder could be linked, but the problem is in figuring out what that link is.This well written novel is fast-paced and will keep you turning the pages late into the night. It shows us the tensions that exist between father and daughter, as well as the deep love that they have for each other. Also, the reader can see just how similar they really are: stuborn and determined. It is also clear from this book that Linda Wallander is here to stay, and should make an appearance in future Mankell creations."
1,Stevia Extract,"I was told that stevia tastes exactly like natural sugar, but has far fewer calories and some health benefits as well. Unfortunately, when I tried it in my tea it produced a very bitter and chemical aftertaste."
3,California,"The book was supposed to be ""like new"". I was disappointed in the condition of the book. The cover jacket was dirty."
4,Two great exclusive tracks here,"Does This Hurt was one of the standouts of Everything's Alright Forever, with its hazy yet faintly techno inspired vibe which of course oved a bit to My Bloody Valentine. BUt the final track, with tis fast and dancable rhytms, is even better, a great simple yet memorbale tune. Boo! Forever is a slow and gentle track, not as urgent as the title suggests. Althought the other track (Buffalo Bill) isn't as good as the rest, this is a good buy for Boo Radleys completionists."
2,Dirt Band/An American Dream - Trash,I am disappointed with this CD. I bought the CD for the title track which proved to be the only track worth listening to in my opinion. I have been a long term fan of The Dirt Band but this CD is not one of their best. If you are looking for happy island style music I suggest sticking with Buffett.
5,Dirt Band/ American Dream,"I really enjoyed this cd and would never get rid of it, it has some great tunes."
3,Not as complete as I had hoped,"Full page color plates of some of the most common tartans, but the book is not as complete as I was looking for. The plates are not as crisp as they could be, and the color quality is off. Altogether, a good introduction to the common tartans, but not the definitive guide the title suggests."
1,Can You Say ... Fantasy,"Basically the premise is that women are really happy being submissive and used by a powerful man (who is really vulnerable underneath, natch.) The heroine proves her worth by putting up with every nasty, humiliating thing the hero can come up with thus proving that being a doormat is a good thing and that putting up with abuse will cure the abuser. (An insidious little philosphy that's killed a lot of women.) And then of course there's the miraculous cure for leprosy, but never mind. Ariane (why does she have a greek name?) is so unbelievable that that fits right in."
2,"Repetition, Repetition and more Repetition","This book seemed so promising, I've read a little over half of this book and it's killing me to finish the rest. This book is wearing me OUT with pages of repetition and thinking to themselves, gracious enough already. I high do not suggest this book."
2,Boring...,"The repetition in this book is incredible. The same sentences are repeated over and over and over.... Why? We never know. I did not like the characters at all. Their relationship had no depth whatsoever, and I have no clue why she decided that she loves him. I agree with another reviewer who suggested to read the first few pages and then just start skipping. That's the only way I could even finish it."
4,1st on this author -- Hooked me.,"A strong & gentle medieval hero. This warrior wasn't cruel to her though at times I really expected it was coming. So saying, I would recommend Nicole Jordan to old Johanna Lindsey fans or Connie Mason fans. The writing is comparable, but less like those truly frustrating conflicts that have you yelling at the characters through the pages. Well, ok I yelled at Ariane and Ranulf -- a little. This story could have moved along faster; but that's all I'd complain about. Very enjoyable and sexy read."
2,Not Nicole Jordan's Best Work,"I am a huge fan of Nicole Jordan's work. Ordinarily, I find her novels well written with a delicate balance of the sensual, sweet and erotic. However, the premise of 'The Warrior', while well written was exceedingly tedious and ultimately boring. The characters seemed one dimensional and more than a little stupid. Don't get me wrong Ms. Jordan doesn't disappoint when it comes to portraying heated sex scenes, the problem is that I've read these scenes almost verbatim in her previous novels. BTW - the endearment 'sweeting' was charming seven novels ago, now it's just annoying."
4,Tabloids as interactive cultural folklore,"Bird is not a former tabloid ""insider,"" but an academic: assistant professor of humanities and anthropology at the University of Minnesota. She discusses tabloid history, beginning as far back as oral ""folklore"" and urban legends. She interviewed tabloid editors, writers, and readers for this book, and analyzes tabloid stories within the context of folklore theory. She claims that tabloid readers are savvier and better-educated than is assumed, that they ""interact and contribute"" to with what they read (through gossip and fantasy), and that working class readers (as much as upper class readers) realize that many tabloid stories are false or exaggerated. Released in 1992, by the University of Tennessee Press. An easy read, despite its academic author and publisher."
3,not impressed,There is some interesting information but overall the book did not give me the info I was looking for. A friend really liked it so I purchased it on her recommendation. We both ended up with two very different opinions. I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Great Service,"Although I haven't yet read the book, the service was great. My book was in excellent condition, and it was delivered promptly. I'll be back to review the product after I've read it. Thanks!"
1,Junk,"This thing is made of cheap plastic and broke as soon as I tried to lock it in to locking device. The origianal is made a lot better, I ended up spending twice as much from ford but it didn't brake as soon as I put it in."
1,It is not what I expected. I consider it a huge waste of money and I regret buying it. I wont watch it more than once.,"I thought this video was going to be a great exercise video but it is not half as good as the one that I already have (Spin Sante) which gives you options for 30 minutes, and 60 minutes and is a great video for working out on your spinner. The accent was a bit annoying after awhile and difficult to understand. It was not a well-made video. I was expecting something that looked more professional and was more functional and motivating. I thought it was a bit boring in the end. I doubt my husband will watch it even once and I bought it for him as a gift."
1,Poorly written,"The author presents a lot of interesting information and has a large bibliography. My main complaint is that it is difficult, if not impossible to discern whether the statements made are based on historical evidence, or are the author's opinion. Occasionally a reference is provided for a statement, but most of the book appears to consist of unsupported opinions. The History of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner covers the same ground and is far better written."
2,Hmmm....,"What a surprise that ""Dr. I. Scott"" is a woman! When you see a first name as an initial, you know it's a woman who doesn't want anyone to know it. With the birth of religious relativity - i.e. all religions are the same - it's no surprise that people are crafting their religions around themselves, seeing in themselves the 'inner diety'. Hence Dr. Scott creates God in her image..."
5,Riviting True Story,"A true story of Missionaries kidnapped in Philipines for Ransom. Others were Kidnapped at the same time, but this couple was held for almost a year.. Story relates to the running from place to place with their captors to avoid Government forces.Remarkable accounts that kept me from putting the book down for hours."
4,Kelly's review,"I enjoyed this book very much. The writing style was different than what I am used to reading so it took a little longer to get into the story but once there, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story of their faith throughout this horrible ordeal. This book is a wonderful testament to the power of prayer and faith in God."
5,Awesome seller,"This is an honest seller. Prompt, and great to communicate with. Would definitely do business with this seller again."
2,In the Presence of My Enemies,"Though I sympathize with the plight of this couple...I found that the reading was a bit slow and drawn out. I have to admit that I stopped reading this half way through as it did not capture my interest. Not to say that it wasn't a good read for others, its just that I found it a bit too slow overall and came across as mundane. Again....I feel for the victims here but thought writing should of moved at a rapid pace."
4,"Great Story, Fast Read, and Powerful","I read through the whole book in about 4 days. It's a fast read, and I was very captured in the story. Hard to believe someone could live through an experience like this and come out as great as Gracia did. I was in awe of her strength and amazing faith.The book is well written, and I was very engaged with it throughout the book. I'm not a very religious person, and at times I thought maybe the religious aspects were a little too much. But, faith is a big part of her life and how she survived the day to day ordeal for so long.Overall a great book, epic story of courage, love and triumph."
4,Inspiring,The moment I started reading this book I coudlnt let it go. An inspiration how God let bad things happen for a good reason.
3,In the Prescence of My Enemies,Great CD- Came on time- Disc 6 was scratched and 75 percent unusable. I really enjoyed the book on tape
4,In the Prescence of my Enemies,"A wonderful story of courage, faith, and perseverance.I remembered the news stories at the time this took place so it was very interesting to hear a first hand account.A very inspiring book."
5,Excellent Life Lessons,"I liked this book. True stories are great and this one was recent. Being christian, I could relate to the spiritual struggles this couple went through. It has some valuable advice about how to handle trials. The author is spunky and bold and reminded me of my own mother and how she might feel and behave in a similar situation. This book also defines the importance of a good marrital relationship and how it can get you through tough times. It was interesting to see how they helped one another to refocus on christian values when it would be easy for both to be filled with anger toward God and their captors. The author is surprisingly non-judgemental and as she learnes how the Abu Sayyaf think according to their beliefs, she mearly makes note of it. There were several times near the end of the book when I wished I had a highlighter to highlight some of her reflections on the experience."
5,The Quality of Mercy,"Even though I knew from news accounts that Martin Burnham was killed during the bungled rescue attempt, it still hit me with such force when I read of his needless death in the jungle. He was a true hero and a man of God. He could have escaped but would not leave his wife behind with such merciless men. I was horrified by the attitudes of those terrorists, even though I should not have been surprised. I read Daughter of Jerusalem, An American's Woman's Journey of Faith, and I learned about the absence of personal accountability and and the absence of mercy in the cultures fostered by Islam. Gracia is a woman of valor and I give thanks for her and Martin."
5,Fantastic true life story,This is a tremendous book. One reviewer stated she wished the author did not try to convert her to christianity all thru the book. This is not a true review because I did not find that to be true at all. I can't wait to get her latest book. She and her husband showed real love thru out the book.
5,prayful,this is a great recap of the times Gracia and Martin were in captivity. it showed how they continued to grow closer to God and each other. loved the book.
5,Amazing yet saddening story...a must read for ever christian (and not) out there!,Gracia i loved your book! several reviews judge you harshly. but if they had been in your situation i dont think they would have acted much differently. that includes myself. others said they were upset that gracia and martin were christians. seriously? i pray some of the bible quotes and things martin and gracia said touched their hearts. i know they touched mine. this is a must read for everyone.
2,Penetrating Biography by a Master,"Much like Boswell's Life of Johnson, this book sacrifices some measure of objectivity and thoroughness to achieve a complete and convincing portrait of the subject in question. Basing her work on the 25 years she has known Prinze, Catalano brings to life the garrulous, insatiable, charming man. The work does drag a bit near the beginning, but bildungsroman has ever been the bte noir of biography. A classic which every bibliophile should own."
2,Kinda flimsy,"Added this to my CJ7. I have no reason to believe it isn't accurate, but the needle is all over the place when driving down the road. If you're installing in a car application it may be better since I am running on knobby 35's but I didn't expect it to bounce around so much."
2,Not videos from the show,"My 4 year old enjoys the Imaginagion Movers on Disney Jr. Late last year, Disney stopped broadcasting the show. We purchased one of the Imagination Movers DVD and he really enjoyed it. I was getting tired of the same episodes and purchased this DVD hoping that they would have the rest of the episodes. Do not fall for it!!! This is a poorly made concert DVD with no episodes! The quality reminds me of 8mm home videos. When you are not watching them jump around on stage, they are acting in high school style-sets. The acting was even worse. Disney really improved the editing and acting for the tv show. I would not buy this DVD, but buy their DVD of the tv shows."
5,FANTASTIC DVD! SO MUCH FUN!,"MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES, LOVES, LOVES THIS DVD. SHE WASNT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AT FIRST SINCE A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE IS FROM YEARS AGO AND ITS FROM ONE OF THEIR LIVE SHOWS. BUT, HONESTLY, IT DOESNT MATTER IF THE FOOTAGE IS OLDER- ITS A GREAT VIDEO. MY DAUGHTER WATCHES IT EVERYDAY, SOMETIMES 3-4 TIMES ADAY. I ENJOY IT AS WELL. YOU END UP SEEING A LOT OF THEIR SONGS BEFORE THEY SHOWED UP ON THEIR TV SHOW. THE DVD IS A LOT OF FUN!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"
2,imagination movers a disappointment,"The Stir it Up DVD was a large disappointment, I've raised 3 children and now have grandchildren and this was not a dvd that I would recommend to anyone."
5,One of my daughters favorite musical DVD's,We thought the CDs where good but this was a fantastic DVD full of color & enthusiasm. Absolutely fabulous creativity and Imagination by the Movers. My daughter loves to dance and sing with the Movers. We've watched this DVD so much we've just about worn it out. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone with active children. Can't wait for the next release. Keep up the great work Imagination Movers!!!!!!
5,Great music and keeps the little ones moving!,"The Imagination Movers are a great group of guys who we first saw during Playhouse Disney every morning. My grandson loves to watch this DVD, he comes running when he hears the music. The songs are fun and are about every day things, like snacks, sleeping in your own bed, brushing your teeth. They encourage the children to participate in the songs, which makes it even more fun."
4,Great video for little ones - The Imagination Movers are awesome!,"My son LOOOOOVES the Movers. We've had this video since they first put it out as a promo. I'm really surprised it hasn't worn out yet!!This video is definitly low budget and kinda hokey. Don't expect the 'Disney' t.v. show version. This was made 'back in the day' when the Movers were just starting out and was filmed in their hometown of NOLA (Chidrens Museum, etc).You'll recognize the songs and the silliness of the Movers. It's a charming video and any kid who loves the Movers will love it!"
2,"Son Loves Imagination Movers, but Isn't Interested in This DVD",My 4 year old son is a huge fan of Imagination Movers. He watches their concert we purchased all the time. He also watches their episodes. I was looking for another DVD with songs/dancing. This was the only one available. It seems dated and my son loses interest.
5,This is before Disney picked them up,"This is great, it has them on stage like a concert and some regular video type songs too. My son loves it. I also bought it for a friends kids and they love the fact that it's live like a concert too."
5,One of Mellick's best.,Fishy Fleshed is the longest of Mellick's books that I have read. It's also his most ambitious.This proves further that Mellick is a genuine story teller and doesn't simply rely on his strange visuals. Not that there is any shortage of bizarre imagery or razor sharp satire. Mellick seamlessly blends science fiction with surrealism to create his own unique voice.This version of the book comes complete with the original text prior to translation. A must own for any fan of the Bizarro genre.
5,Creative,"This book was too short but at the same time it did all it needed to do. You could really get to know the character in the short length of the novella. One reason I enjoyed this novella is that it did not drone on longer than it needed to. At the same time I wished that it was longer. This dude also seems to be somewhat of an artist, I hope one day he releases a book of his art. Also the first 25 or so pages in his created language are either a work of genious or a lame gimmick, either way the english version was great. If you are looking for a quick entertaining novel with interesting characters and situations or if you are already a Mellick or Eraserhead Press fan I definitely recommend this book. If you are looking for the literary event of the year this probably won't do it for you."
1,Awful,"Having read and loved Satan Burger, read and had positive feelings for Sunset with a Beard and read and owned ambivalence over The Menstruating Mall, I didn't know what to think going into Fishyfleshed.The best thing about the book is that it only takes about an hour and a half to read. The first twenty pages are gibberish, the book is littered with scribbles and the rest is double-spaced 14pt font like a kid trying to cheat at a school essay.The book was written, as it says in the forward, as a stream of consciousness. It shows. There is little subtlety and the imagery has nothing behind it. The form is dreadful. There are little flashes of interesting topics, only to be brushed aside and forgotten.It is just a _stupid_ work. I've seen him do better. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
5,This guy Rocks!!!................,"Mr. Mellick is so cool. He isn't the new Vonnegut like everyone says. I'm the new Vonnegut. But, he is a wonderful author that just really touches you in those hard places to reach. Those dark, damp places where our sadistic intentions dwell and fumigate. I loved this book, and it gave me a woody that lasted for hours and hours on end. Thanks Carlton Mellick!! Keep the books coming and I will keep reading them."
5,Great Choice for Triple Monitors,"I have this stand running 3 23"" Samsung's. The Outside monitors are standing vertical, then center monitor is horizontal. I couldn't get through my day with out being a web designer. Very easy to use, adjust height & width, and orientation of the monitors. Two thumbs up for me.It's one of my favorite parts to my computer. Can't say enough great things about it."
4,monitor stand,"the monitor stand is very big and heavy, but gives you the flexiblity to change postions on your desk. easy to put together and works like advertised. worth the extra money, because it should last a long time."
4,"Using this stand with two Samsung Widescreen 23"" LCD Monitor","I bought this stand because of the functionality described in the product. The stand is actually bigger than you think. It was easy to assemble together and fits two of my 23"" Samsung widescreen monitors. This stand can also hold upto three 24"" regular LCD monitors. So, if your have widescreen monitors to mount, consider this instead of the Double Display stand version. This stand rises up and down, tilts up and down. The monitor can rotate 90 degrees. It comes with a cable channel to run your cables through."
2,Boring usw.,This book is awefully boring. The stories are poorly writen. This is a terrible book to use as a addition to any German class.
5,Reality hits hard,"Aruna's Story is more, much more than a mere story. It's a phenomena and author Pinki Virani deserves all credit for her investigation and her style of writing. You know about it, still you keep shut, you understand their plight still you keep shut, but you can never feel it, feel the pain and agony of someone who'd been raped. Aruna, the KEM Medical College nurse on whom the true accouts are based could even feel it... only her body was alive and her brain was dead. Virani explores and righfully dicovers how bitter truth can be and that it indeed is a very rare case where justice is done right... in this case justice itself was shamed. Aruna;s story is an eye-opener for people who wish to know about the callousness of the Indian Medical force and also serves as a very nice guide for writers who wish to go in for investigative work. Aruna's Story is REAL!"
3,Caution,"Know before you purchase this book that it presumes you know German as well as English. The author quotes Goethe liberally in German throughtout his text and notes while offering no translation for those not fluent in German. Disregard my rating, however. I haven't read it yet, so can't evaluate it yet. Question is: will I be able to read it at all? I don't speak German."
5,Works just fine,"Basic ceramic rings for your canister filter or sump filter. I used it in a 10 gallon sump, bought 2 boxes which was more than enough. Fits the description, works well, no problems with use or quality."
4,dinos face to face,"If you like Dougal Dixon's other works (After Man, The New Dinosaurs etc.) then you will just love this one. You will have the chance to meet a huge number of the once existed dinosaurs face to face. Dixon's narrative is amazing and clear, easy to understand for the layman, too, but also scientifically accurate. Go on, order this one!"
3,"good video, but they all skip","I have bought this item 3, yes, THREE times, and each time the DVD skips. The other Noodlebug DVD we have is fine, but there is something wrong with this one. Don't buy it, although if you do, Amazon has great customer service and easy returns. Too bad, because my daughter LOVES this video and even watches it when it skips, but it's to annoying for me!"
2,Not Very Good :(,"I have alot of Firm workouts from different time periods and I don't think this one is very good. I think they were trying to make this a work where you use multiple muscle groups at the same time and I don't think it worked too well. If you want to sculpt your body and you have the time try the Firm's "" Super Sculpting "" workout."
4,Not exactly what I expected to be,"This book is a really good book to start learning PHP. I wished I had this book a couple of years earlier, it would've saved me a lot of time and money. But this is actually the whole problem with this book. Yes, it covers flash, but it'll only learn you how you can work with PHP-variables in Flash. There are no projects that covers creating a complete flash project with PHP, it'll learn you how to create the scripts for Flash, so Flash can use the script. These tutorials can be found anywhere on the internet, so you don't really need this book.It learns you more about PHP than Flash. Maybe I expected too much from it, but that's my opinion. After all, it's a good book for starting with PHP in flash."
5,My 2 year old LOVES,"My 2 year old son is obsessed with Noodlebug. He had Animal Friends first, now this is his second Noodlebug. These are his favorite DVDs and he walks around saying ""Noodlebug"" all day. I highly recommend these for toddlers."
1,what's wrong with this perfume,"It does not smell like Gucci rush, nor does it stay on very long. Do not purchase from here go to overstock and get it"
2,Not the best experience,"When I received the product, the liquid was spilled all over the box, and there was like half of the perfume left. I contacted the seller and they sent me another one that arrived in the same conditions."
1,PEE Yoou!,I waste money on this when I was 16 and it smelled too mature for me.I got compliment from mostly older women so ended up giving it away to my friends mom.
1,Very disapointed with the product,"When I got the product and opened, it looked like it was leaking, but I tought it will not be to much, but when my fiance opened complety, the perfume container was almost emty, I know that since it was shipped from the company, they knew that the perfume was leaking and still they shipped it any way, now I can not find the company to complaint about this problem, I will never buy from this company and you Amazon should be more careful about this, if any can be done, I will like to get a reimbursment or the same prefume but complete. Amazon is requesting from me to rate this item, but I will prefer to rate the company, I will not give them not even a single star, they are shipping defective product, and they know that.Arturo Lomeli"
5,Saw this last nite on my Free Movies cable station,"It was so engrossing and Kim Stanley brought tears to my eyes with her portrayal of deep mental illness. I don't know if she won any awards, but she should have. Lloyd Bridges, in his prime body, was also good as her 2nd husband who couldn't cope with her illness. This must of be one of first movies to try to deal with this very sad and frustrating disease. Kim Stanley was wonderful in this difficult role. Very well done. Highly recommended."
3,unexpected,i thought i purchased the movie but it wasnt the full movie so i was disappointed. The movie looked to have great sexy fun appeal.
3,"This is short video, not the full movie.","I watched this because it was free with Amazon Prime, and I was curious about the movie. This video was entertaining, but if you are after the entire movie, this is not for you."
3,con,Very silly movie. Couldn't finish it. Just didn't like it.The instant videos are high quality and easy to use.
2,In A Word: Offensive.,"As a man (who IS into women, Thank You Mr.Dweeb director.), I find this offensive. It comes across as male-bashing on a number of levels. I see the target audience as being a bunch of male-bashing B*tches. Lotsa luck w/that..."
2,Not worth watching,Do not waste time on this. This preview was nothing I expected. So please watch a good movie and spend time and money wisely
1,What A Rip Off!,"I thought I was getting the whole movie, turns out it was only a 12 minute preview.I haven't found one good (free) movie on Amazon Prime yet."
3,The Ugly Truth,"Yeah, some folks would be tempted to pan this movie because it shows both sexes at their very worst. It is a bit on the raunchy side, particularly the very funny ""give us a break"" scene about female masturbation. As if we all don't know that women burp, fart and masturbate, even though they deny it. Hint vibrators are now being sold in drug store chains, so somebody has to be using them... This is spoof and Heigl and Butler do a good job of reminding us about that and also that men and women are certainly better than this -- as do the other members of the cast. If you have a problem with this movie you take life too seriously. That said, the ending is predictable and a bit of a letdown. Hence only 3 stars despite very funny acting."
1,YUK!,"the ugly truth is I did not like this movie. it happened to be playing on tv and i recorded it. I forward most of it through. It is crude, rude, obseen and immoral, I would never buy it or watch it or recomend it to anyone. it should defenatly not been shown on television. I am so dissapointed in the actors since they are both used to be one of my favorite actors."
5,For lovers of formal gardens,"While formal gardens are not currently en vogue, for those of us who love them anyway, Roy Strong illustrates numerous patterned beds that could be applied to any size space and to any style preference. The hard part is choosing. I have tried to get this book for a couple of years at a price that I could afford, and I was thrilled to finally find one on Amazon. It was worth the wait."
5,"razor sharp, just don't try to shave with it","This knife has a nice elegant look to it and come absolutely razor sharp from the company. However dispite the fact that one of the blades looks like a shaving razor, it isn't. Excelent knife for precision carving, but only if you are careful."
4,Good product,"I ordered 2 boxes of boys pull ups for my nephew. One box said boy pull ups but there was girl pull ups in them. He still likes his ""pink princess"" pull ups."
1,Poor Quality,"I like these because the sides pull apart - makes it easy to remove them without taking off pants and shoes. However, the quality of the last few packs I've received have been very poor. The blue sealing strip has been coming off and today the sides just ripped as my child stepped into them. I've been throwing away 2-5 damaged pull-ups per pack, and although I did like these, I'm not buying them again."
2,convenient but does not hold much,"It's a nicely designed product with velcro sides, that is easy to put around or to pull up. However, we ended up with too many accidents that were not contained by this product. So one had to change pants, wash child sit and the sofa covers..."
2,no different than regular pull ups/ or diapers for that matter,"worked as well as any regular pull up, the cool factor did not phase my son. They hold a lot more than other reviews state, I think the key is getting the right fit."
1,Pull ups for lazy parents,"Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom. Potty training does not include using diapers. That is what these are is fancy diapers. If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them. The wetness liner is a joke. These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants."
5,A Rare Gem,"A heartfelt concept album, Ecdysis creates the perfect atmosphere for blowing off work to go wander around in a modern art museum all day. Hatori's voice is delicate but with an underlying richness, her accent often a sparkling adornment. Her songs convey a multitude of inspirations from music, culture, science and nature.There are similarities (and contrasts) to Byork, Cibo Matto etc. but after a few listens you tend to forget them and start soaking up Hatori's tasty concoctions, in and of themselves."
1,This book is a disgrace!!!,"I bought this book for christmas. I had hoped to improve my knowledge of upholstery through it, but I was dissappointed!. This book has only black and white MINI pictures!!. How in the world can one learn to upholster with black and white pictures. These pictures are so bad that they sometimes look just like a black patch? For me, buying this book was a big waste of money. An upholstery book with no good picture is not interesting to read and very very boring!!!"
4,Truly a Complete Course,"I just received this book yesterday and already I have learned a great deal about re-upholstery. This book has made me very excited and confident that I can do a good job on my first project. As far as I can tell it covers just about every issue in concise and easy to understand language. I would give it a 5 star rating but for the darkness of some of the photos. However, there are an abundance of photos and if you read the instructions carefully then a few dark photos won't be much of a hinderance. If you are interested in learning about upholstery then this is the book and you can't beat the price for this much information."
4,Las Vegas: Season Four,other than the wrong zoning ( I didn't make sure before buying we wanted to see the next season so badly at the itme) still was an awesome buy! would trade again!
3,NO SUBTITLES!!! WHY!?!?!,"I like this series from since the first episode, light violence, beautiful ladies, enjoying plot. I buy the first three seasons, and my wife enjoy them too because she now can understand better the episodes thanks to the subtitles, and this season don't have it. Now i have to sit next to her to traduce every time she doesn't understand something.Shame on you, remember the latinos always! :)"
4,Well I enjoyed this season quite alot,"Las Vegas has always been a TV show that did the thing it was meant to do, and thats entertain me.Sure it is a little bit shorter than the other seasons but even still is definitely worth it if you enjoyed the previous seasons.There are some good episodes like when Sam finds a dead stripper in one of her clients rooms or the Xmas episode where Danny's car gets stolen, then destroyed.Las Vegas is a enjoyable experience with plenty of laughs to be had, no question a keeper."
5,Las Vegas Season 4,"The package came in in 3 days as they said it would. it was well packages, good bubble padding. The DVD box set was brand new so no scratches or marking of any kind. Amazon you have done it again!"
4,A Classic!,I love Las Vegas the series. IN some ways it was campy and it definitely was pre-recession of 2008 in terms of being over the top but it does evoke that time perfectly. I think foremost though this is about the character development which was exceptional. Definitely recommend. Season 4 is a great season in the show.
2,"Nice Idea, Lousy Execution","Some unique and wonderful war stories made this otherwise embarassingly bad book worth the time invested in reading it. Sadly, Bruce not only worked without a ghost writer, but must have negotiated a deal that tied his editor's hands. Too much of the writing is disjointed, self-indulgent, and inappropriately compiled. Some parts contain too much uninteresting personal detail (although a daughter-in-the-studio story or two might have been fun), while others contain more technical details than even a geek like me wants to read (I already know that I'll never be able to afford 99% of the equipment he uses). Much too frequently, sentence after sentence is distractingly bad or inappropriate. This could have been a monumental work if someone like Bobby Owsinski had interviewed Bruce and written the book. Instead, we have an awful first draft of great stories by someone that has no writing skills. Enjoy the stories, but know what you're getting."
2,good engineer bad writer,"Unfortunately, Bruce Swedien's writing talents do not live up to the same standards as his recording talents. That having been said, it is nice to hear about little bits of recording history and life success."
4,It was a gift,"Mr. Swedien's wife gave me this book for my son, and I'm so happy to have it. It is a who's who of sound and gives you a peek into Mr. Swedien's life. This man's life has been blessed with many experiences that he shares and I was happily entertained. If you are expecting instructions on ""how to"" this book doesn't give you that insight. If you are looking for a career doing what Mr. Swedien does, are are seeking to be a true professional, I would recommend buying this book. I thank the Swedien's for sharing their stories."
1,Very good should not have a completely ripped cover,"I was so excited to get this, it's cover was completely torn up. Very disappointing. Not worth spending the money to return or I would have contacted the seller and returned."
5,LETS START COOKING,I never knew great meals could be so easy to prepare ... and so quickly. I love to cook for friends and family and no one ever suspects how little time and effort I utilize to make meals that look and taste like something out of a gourmet restaurant.
5,Rachael Ray's open house,I love all of her books. And if you need to tweak a recipe that is already so simple hers are easy to do it to. She speaks in plain english and measurments are easy.
5,This cookbook is amazing!,I have only had this cookbook for about a week and a half and I have already made two of the chicken recipes and they were absolutely delicious!!! I HIGHLY recommend this book to all the cooks out there!
5,A fantastic example of Brookmeyer's pen and Lewis's sword,"This CD is a definitive example of the kind of excellent big band arrangements which grew out of the early 1980s. Mel Lewis's licks are tasty, and Brookmeyer provides the dense harmonies and creative changes needed to stand behind Lewis's empty spaces. While all of the arrangements are refreshing, Skylark should be heralded: the beautiful, dark harmonies and milky horns form an entirely new song from the ashes of a work which has been performed excellently too many times."
5,We won in Vietam and lost on the Network news.,"The book confirms Churchill's dictum that Americans can be coun ted on to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other alternatives. It reveals that virtually all conventional wisdom about America's major episode in the last 50 years is wrong. Having been involved there off and on through the war, I can corroborate Nixon's veracity. Yes we did win in Vietnam hands down by 1973. After a lot of preliminary mistakes we did win Hearts & Minds and we did bring Hanoi to sign on our terms. The media rubbed America's face in the dirt on Vietnam, but we should all be very proud of what Americans did in Southeast Asia despite media treachery.EARLKULP"
4,Great Reference Book For The Steelmaking Process,"Great reference manual but be advised that there is actually an ironmaking version and a steelmaking version of this book and are sold seperately from each other. If your interested in cokemaking and ironmaking activities, the ironmaking version is what you want. If your interested in the steelmaking process (ie. BOF, EAF, Ladle Refining, etc.), the steelmaking version is an excellent reference. There is also some redundancy in both books. Overall both books are great references for the making, shaping, and treating of steel."
2,"making, shaping and treating of steel","The outside picture of this book is different when you click inside and also the content is 10th edition content, yes there is a notice but it popped up very quick and then disappear before you noticed it.And i made wrong order because of this.What i want is edition 10th as per the content but delivered was 11th edition.I suggest Amazon to update the content of the book all the time to avoid confusion and wrong orderThank you"
1,Does not fit SIG 229 40 S&W,"The holster appears to be well made, But it does not fit SIG 229. It was so tight that when I put the gun in the holster, it moved the slide back. Returned to Amazon."
1,Very disappointed,"My son was very excited about receiving this order. When it came today, it was completely unassembled and breakable. We were unable to even put one of the guns together. We had to throw it away. Very dissatisfied with this product."
5,"Once and for all time, Donna Troy's life revealed!","I had enjoyed reading The Teen Titans in the eighties and thought I knew the truth of the character of Donna Troy. She was an original memeber of the group and her background was all laid out. However when The Crisis On Infinite Earths came about, her past was shattered and not reformed until ten years later. She moved about to find her own place in the DC universe to claim her mantle of Wonder Girl after the Amazon Queen was briefly Wonder Woman in the era of the second world war. She was later found to be the mystic twin of Diana who would become the second Wonder Woman but stolen by the character Dark Angel. Rescued by the Titan Rhea, she was educated and trained by the Titans of Myth before joining the Teen Titans. The rest is revealed in the pages of this great graphic novel and if you want the rest of the story, get the Death And Return of Donna Troy! It explains so much more!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Donna Troy has been many things, a cute kid putting up with a bunch of boys in the Teen Titans, and the heart of an older bunch. An amazon, a Darkstar, Troia, a wife, and a widow, as well as an anomaly in the multiverse, and a titan of myth. This trade goes some way towards detailing and explaining what is actually going on with this character. Straightforward, she isn't."
3,it's stillb Greek to me,It was a good book to read for a better understanding of the Greek language.
4,A staple item for your bookshelf.,I found this textbook to be a great read. I would definitely advise communications scholars to hold onto this one for future reference.
2,Informative but could be much better!,"This book is well researched and has alot to give to the reader. However, I find myself wondering why Miller decided to go so complex with some of the examples. I have read my fair share of communication theory books and this one just isn't as concise and consistent as ones that I have read previously."
1,Worst textbook I've ever purchased and been required to read,Plan to have a supplemental textbook for reference [I actually used 2 supplements]. This is the worst textbook I've ever been required to read. The authors supply more historical information than practical theoretical relations.
2,Incompletely Complete,"This book, while giving complete information, is poorly written and has an obvious political skew. There are constant references to ""So-and-so says ..."" and every second line there is a parenthetical documentation that severely breaks up any flow while reading. The information is complete, and extremely accurate, but that is a small pay off for the lack of structure and extremely small, congested print."
2,If you are a student - steer clear!,"This was probably written to be a lab manual for a class. I bought it as a professional to polish up on my DSP. It contains ""hands on"" exercises in Matlab to demonstrate DSP principles. My two main gripes are the same with this book as most other engineering books and are as follows: (1) it is not written to it's intended audience - the student. It is written for the professor (ie the authors colleagues) and (2) it contains no solutions (as a previous reviewer stated). I would also like to point out that Matlab 5 is ""old"" now and some of the functions used in this book have been renamed in the later version of Matlab. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."
5,Niacin-bound Chromium,"This is a great product and is cheap. Since my doctor loves it, I do too. He said that I should stop taking the Statin drug and take 500 mg of Niacin along with this Niacin-bound Chromium instead."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I read this book while I was a college student at Illinois State University in Normal/Bloomington during the early 90's. Since the murders took place in Bloomington, this was very interesting to me since this had occurred right in my own backyard, so to speak, while down there (a decade or more earlier, though. This would have been a very interesting book, even if I wasn't a student down there. Soon after reading this book, David Hendrick's was trying to get paroled. He was on Oprah and after having read this book it was quite fascinating. I can't remember, what the outcome was; it was about 10 years ago, after all. But I'd have to say this was a good read."
1,Potpourri of various religious practices: No real depth.,"The author tried to make something useful and meaningful from a mixture of various religious practices he learned. Apparently he failed, however. This book turned out to be a potpourri of several religious practices and ideas without providing real depth. I am afraid this book would make my days more complex rather than simple. I want to ask the author one question; is Jusus not enough for us and you as a priest to go to God?"
2,NOT for PC developers!,"When I stumbled across this book at Amazon, I thought it was an answer to my prayers. I am a VB/VBA programmer and I've been working with AS/400 data for a few months now. I am not an AS/400 person, so I've been bringing the data to my PC and manipulating it in Access and Excel.It seemed like this book would provide good tips to make this process run more smoothly, but it has absolutely nothing in it that I don't already know...This book is probably wonderful for AS/400 people who have limited PC experience, but for Windows developers with limited 400 experience, it is useless.Dollar for page, it's also one of the most expensive computer books I've ever seen."
1,My staff was very disappointed,"I often purchase technical books from Amazon because the local stores never have them. Amazon is a great place to learn what's out there. I purchased a few copies this book at a conference for several of members of my staff. The topic was new to me but seemed relevant and though the cost is very high for a thin paperback, I expected the quality of the information to reflect the price. The comments from my staff were universally negative and I also found it far too casual (without any useful depth) and not written to normal technical standards. When I called the company that publishes this $79.00 book to see about returning it I learned they have gone out of business. No Wonder..."
4,Fun and Hot,"The characters are well-developed and their emotions are so real. The scenery is beautiful, and believable. The villains are hidden within, and revealed in good time. Though, this could have been a 5-star book if the beginning didn't seem to rush into the romance because of the heroine being ""American"". That was stupid of the author to do that to the characters. That just shows what an idiot the male is in here; looking for an easy ""get-together"" with a female he believes to have loose morals. I think the novel deserves 4-stars."
1,THIS IS AN OK BOOK,"I generally like Martin's works, but this book was extremely flat. Like the previous readers, I also felt that the mistress Martin threw at the end was uncalled for and just ruined the book for me. The wife discovers her husband with the mistress as she searches for him. I want romance not infidelity. Take a pass on the book."
1,Infuriating romance - Do not buy.,"I'm only writing this review right now because this terrible, God awful, I wished I never wasted my time spending a penny on, has a 4 stars over-all rating. I strongly disagree, giving this book 1 star would be generous.I don't hate all books with cheating. I firmly believe that if the author is talented enough, they can pull off any plot line, however, this author didn't pull it off here. The hero is a cheating bastard. The heroine is weakling for taking him back. The book itself is mediocre at best.Go ahead, waste your money."
5,Another Great Everett Anderson book!,Everett's friend is being abused and Everett doesn't know how to help him. The author deals sensitively with a subject that is becoming all too common. A well written book.
3,"Solid information, but littered with many typos","Too many typographic errors for a book of this quality. Many examples appear to have been cut and pasted from a previous listing, then never modified so that code is correct.One of the serious drawbacks of ColdFusion is it's simplicity and the ability to have new developers coding within a short time. These new developers will struggle with the errors, or worse yet, generate inefficient code.Having used ColdFusion for a number of years, we simply deserve better."
5,An awesome resource,"For me, this is the best Greek Bible dictionary on the market. I disagree with other posts disparaging the accuracy of this volume. I have used Vines, Strongs and Mounce and I find this to be better, more accurate and more in depth by far. Some of the entries are almost mini-commentaries. Combine this with a good Greek reverse interlinear Bible and you will have the finest word study tools money can buy. A real gem!"
4,great help!!!!,"As a pastor, this is a very handy book to have. It was received quickly and in good shape and I have enjoyed it so very much. I like the descriptions that let us ""look inside"".......helps a lot."
2,boring though carefully created,"I bought this video for my 20 month old son. bought it when he was 16 months and he hated it instantly so i thought he was too young for this and waited another four months. played it again and he didnt like it this time either though HE LOVES THE THEME SONG... he dances to it with so much excitement...but doesnt like the rest of it... even though he could watch anything with animals.. he loved baby babble so much more than i now know for sure that he understands DVDs .,..this one didnt hold his attention and i could see he was visibly bored. i wud have to say the contents are not bad at all,, just boring."
5,More Great Torme,"This was one of the last vinyl albums I purchased, and I got it after being enthralled by the ""Maisonette"" album. I'm going off memory, but this is terrific. Mel had totally swinging covers of ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Day in Day Out"" (a tune he often covered and re-covered throughout his career), and the ""Fred Astaire Medley"" is a reminder of the fact that Astaire and G.Gershwin were kindred spirits back in the '30's. As I recall, Mike Renzi was the pianist on this one, and while he didn't mesh with Torme as well as George Shearing, he nevertheless acquitted himself very well here. Patter-wise, Torme had a bad tendency to be smarmy, but as I recall, his smarminess didn't get in the way of a great performance here. Recommended."
4,Mel is in great form - sound is not so bad,"While the sound quality is not great, it is hardly the disaster painted by other reviewers. Most importantly, Mel is in great form and delivers a very enjoyable set. The song selection is a good balance between ballads and swingers, and Mel sounds like he's having fun. My favorites are Lulu's Back in Town and the Fred Astaire medley, but the whole album is strong. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes Mel Torme."
3,A great evening with Mel Tormé,"The quality of the sound of this live recording is mediocre, but for me this is more than compensated by the great atmosphere. Mel Tormé is in high spirits, frequently making jokes between the songs. For me, highlights of this recording are the tribute to Fred Astaire (medley) and a beautiful version of What are you doing the rest of your life. Give it a try, I'm sure it will put a smile on your face."
1,Do Not Buy This CD! The Sound Quality is Very Poor!,This is not competitive! Any of the Concord releases sound much better than this rip-off item. Rhino has a couple of reissues from the 50's and 60s that sound way better than this. A rotten value if ever there was one.
5,Saw the Author on TV,"I saw Beverly Rose Hopper on TV discussing roses, so I figured she must be a real gardener expert. Beverly Hopper was also very humorous, so I bought this book, and I was not disappointed.Beverly Rose Hopper is an expert on roses, and knows how to bring humor into the gardening world as well.You can't go wrong with this book. How Does Your Garden Grow? makes a great gift for yourself or the gardener in your life."
1,Vapid,"There are a couple of good quotes in the book. But most of it is vapid. I guess it might appeal to the Hallmark crowd. But you'll find better, more thoughtful and eloquent quotes about gardening with a quick Google search. Even Twitter would turn up better quotes than this."
1,Superman is a hero for EVERYONE!,"Sadly, this author wants to use Superman as a means to convert people to his viewpoint. Considering that Siegel and Shuster were Jewish, they would probably roll over in their grave to know their cherished creation (modelled after Moses - not Jesus) was being used to promote one religion over all others and make no mistake that is what this author is doing. Could Superman be modelled after Moses? Sampson? Nope - not according to the author who stated - ""It is so on the nose that anyone who has not caught on that Superman is a Christ figure, you think, 'Who else could it be referring to?'"" This was a quote from him but lets look at his book - ""Doesn't the figure of Superman reflect other divine figures? My answer is, in a word, no. The attraction of Superman to humankind is actually the attraction of no one else but Christ"". So Muslims, Jews, Atheists etc etc you better get it straight - its Christ or nothing. Personally, I believe Superman is a hero for all."
5,Believe you can fly,"Great book about morality and an American icon. In this day and age of over the top violent and dark ""heroes"" it Is good to kmow Superman remains true. Accessible without being preachy. All fans of Superman or comic book heroes in general should give this book a chance."
4,Not the First,"The comparison between Superman and Jesus the Christ may seem a little daunting but this is not the first effort of its type - I recommend (and good luck finding it) ""The Gospel According to Superman"" which was written back in the early '70's. Of course, Robert Short started all of this with his ""Gospel According to"" and ""Parables of"" Peanuts."
2,outdated text book,Tho it is listed as published this year it is actually 100 years old. The Spanish is formal and outdated--think of the formal stilted literary English of the early 1900's. There are also some sentences in the 2nd story with missing words which changes meaning. I am returning it.
4,Good book for learning,Having stories that are already familiar is a great way to learn to read Spanish. If only I had a Spanish dictionary that could help me as I go along...
3,Haven't used yet.,"I have this on my kindle reader, but I haven't used it yet. I'm looking forward to learning correct Spanish."
3,"Appropriate level of material, poor presentation","The texts chosen are an appropriate level of material and the glossary is useful, but the appearance of the book and its lack of a table of contents leave room for improvement. Also, a beginning learning text could benefit from providing exercises for students to practice written and/or spoken expression about the texts in the book."
2,but i don't read spanish yet,Wish some of the public domains had pictures to go with them. Many diagrams called for but none in these books. Withtechnology today these need to be updated. But I guess the old saying you get what you pay for holds true. Thought this was a beginner's book to learn with
3,An Elementary Spanish Reader,"Love to read. Love to learn Very nice way to know more from spanish readers, it helps and provides to improve my knowledges and aware of new things in the world"
2,Sunnywood PT3021D Portraits Vanity Review,I had to return this product because the package came already damaged. This product requires assembly. The sidewall panels are made of particle woods and the quality is low. The supplier's service was good and they did accept my return. I would not hesitate to purchase other products from them because just about every person I talked to try to be helpful. I ended up getting a custom-ordered vanity at a much higher cost. It's difficult to purchase a funiture type of product without seeing it.
1,Horrible!!,This is NOT for any kid just starting out in potty training. Barely holds anything. My daughter sooked through it twice on 2 different occasions. Once on a car ride & once trying to make it to the bathroom. She was so upset & I was in a state of sho k. She needed whole new outfits & I had to pull apart the carseat to be washed. I wouldn't even chance it for nap time or bedtime. We wll not be using these again. I would rather just continue with diapers during those times & chance it with underwear any other time.
1,BEWARE: caused bad chafing in my daughters groin area,the diapers seemed to fit well (I have a very petite child) but after a week of use i noticed that my daughter had developed some painful chafing in her groin area i would not recommend these diapers for any child definitely not for one that has thicker thighs. Also my daughter ignored the cooling sensation i am just going to buy cotton training pants and some undies for her during the day and nighttime pull ups.
1,My daughter got a rash from them,"My daughter weighs 27 lbs, and I bought the 2-3T size. These diapers are small. Really small. They hardly fit her and are supposed to fit up to 34lbs. She is a thin baby. In addition, the cool liner thing didn't work for my daughter, she didn't mind having it on for quite a while. It does not seem cool to the touch to me. At all. Third day of wearing, she got a rash and started to itch. The liner ""broke"" in to tiny little white balls, and the diaper was hardly used. They are low quality, and not worth the money. Go Pampers. I never should have swapped in the first place."
1,Not priced right,Why are the pull-ups for girls over $4 more than the pull-ups for boys. I'm not buying this brand. Not fair.
1,Huggies just being Huggies,No wonder I stay away from Huggies products.. This one is just like the rest. They don't work (at least not for our family or any of our friends). The liner doesn't do anything. My little one doesn't seem to feel any difference. But try Pampers Feel'n Learn and there's your difference! I will NEVER get another Huggies product. What a waste..
2,Cool Alert doesn't work.,"These pull-ups work fine to absorb missed potty opportunities, but my daughter cannot feel the ""cool alert"" feature. When wet, the pull-up feels full & warm, just like a diaper. I really don't appreciate the use of licensed characters on training pants, and I will not promote the ""princess culture"" by giving my daughter these pull-ups with those *$%^@ ubiquitous Disney Princesses. We switched to the other brand."
5,TO CHANGE THIS ITEM BY 4T-5T,I have problem with our post office because they never deliver a package in my area 10459 and every time you go to the post office you have to spend in a waiting line for 30 mn minimum.....
3,"Cool enough, just not motivating enough","From the advertising on this particular product, I assumed the wetness liner was suppose to make the toddler uncomfortable enough to realize that he/she was wet and to learn to prevent ""wetness"". At one point, i did check and it did feel cool to the touch as it was wet. However, my daughters (twins) didn't mind the coolness and it wasn't effective as I originally thought it to be. Huggies and Pampers both have similar diapers, so if I were to purchase these again, I would compare prices and go with the cheaper ones. There's no need to buy these if they are more expensive. As for leakage and lining, both Huggies and Pampers are about the same. One doesn't hold up significantly better than the other. One real advantage of Huggies tho, is their velcro lining. My girls are thinner than the average baby, so it helps to be able to adjust the pull ups a little even tho the banding is stretchable."
1,Ouch!,"Used these just a few times. My daughter's reaction was ""Ouch!"" and then she was afraid to pee, which was not the reaction/result we were looking for. We will not be getting these again!"
4,"Great protection, sized a little small","My 3 year old daughter uses these at night only. She is able to pull them on and off by herself. We have never had a problem with leaking or ripping. My only complaint in that the size is 3T-4T - she is just barely grown into size 4T pants, but the diapers fit VERY snugly. Will probably need to order 5T next time."
2,doesnt work,My 2 yr old said ouch when I put the first one on her. She would just keep taking them off. After that she didnt care and she leaves them on for a long time. These haven't worked on her.I thought a long time ago 3 yrs ago my son used these well to potty train. maybe they made them different.
3,not worked for me,We try to train our 3.5 yrs daughter with this one but cool alert doesn't worked with her. Also some reviewer claimed that you need to buy 1 less size compared to diapers you are using. I would say NO WAY. made this mistake too :(
5,Huggies pull ups,I love these pull ups! I like the tabs on the sides alot good for potty training. My daughter loves the cute print and so do I :)
1,Not worth the money,I typically order the huggies Nighttime training pants and thought this could substitute for it but I was dead wrong. This does not hold well and my daughter ended up either wetting the bed or soiling her clothes. Very disappointing but the difference is very clear even from just feeling on the material. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,OK but I think Pampers is better.,My twins enjoy the princess print but pampers easy ups are a lot better at preventing leaks. I'd say that pull ps are good if you're kid is mostly potty trained and I definitely recommend pampers easy ups if your kid still has some learning to do!
3,Cool Alert ?,"These are standard Pull Ups. Didn't feel cool at all. I poured room temperature water on one to feel myself and it felt room temperature. No real ""cool"" feeling that is supposed to cause awareness by child.I wish they would invent a pull up and would actually get cold when they peed. Great concept, poor execution."
3,It's just ok (2-3 stars),"It's much shorter than others training pants. Also, it doesn't get uncomfortable when wet so my daughter just stays in it. It definitely doesn't motivate her to stay dry."
2,Unfortunately these are a must for daycare...however,"Pull ups in general will keep your child in diapers/pullups longer, making lots more money for the diaper companies. It's best if you get a pair of padded old fashion cotton training pants with the vinyl covers. That way your child can actually FEEL wet and uncomfortable when the pee in their pants!! Imagine that?Too bad they are so hard to find, though I know for a fact they are available here on Amazon.Good luck!"
1,Smaller than regular pull-ups,Smaller than regular pull-ups and very uncomfortable for my daughter to go No.2. I wish I could return it. Won't be ordering this cool alert again.
3,They're Good If You Want to Go That Route,"I like Pull-ups. They are thinner & more like undies, making it easier to potty train. My 15 month old started training herself at 12 months; much to my joy. I found however, that Pull-ups and comperable products are much more expensive than regular diapers & come in smaller packages. I understand that they are not supposed to be used as diapers, but I want my daughter to understand there is a difference when you use the potty. Not to mention being able to feel the difference. I'm going to continue to use them, because they're fun & easy. However, for now, at home, I'm using training pants that are handwashable. They work very well to allow baby to feel wet & begin to tell when she has to go. For those of you who don't want to do the work-Pull-ups are awesome. Just make sure you change them more fequently than diapers as they are not as absorbent."
3,Serves half the purpose,It serves the purpose of a pull-up but I don't think my daughter realizes the coolness when she pees in it. The easy open sides are great but to her it's just like a regular diaper.
3,No real difference from diapers for us,"I thought this was something different than the cool alert pull-ups since it is called wetness liner on the site. But, when I got the product, it was indeed the cool alert pull-ups. The cool alert does not seem to phase our daughter any more than wetting in a regular diaper. They are easier to pull up and down for the several unsuccessfull trips to the potty chair, but other than that, we have seen no real difference. I was hoping the wetness liner would help, but obviously these have either been discontinued or was just an old name for cool alert."
3,Not overly impressed,"My 2.5 year old does fairly well with using the potty (for ""pee pee""..poop is another story!) & I thought these might help to remind her to go in time. At first, I really did see a surge in her interest in the potty. She LOVED the Disney Princess design which she's all about these days, but that seemed to wear off after a couple of weeks. She never said anything about a cool feeling. What I don't like is the fit on her. She's 33 months old & 28lbs but she's still got a bit of the baby chunkiness in her thighs. I thought the 2T-3T would fit well but it was too tight around her inner thighs. I've never been a big fan of the Pull-Up-esque products because I think they're glorified diapers, especially these. They have the same idea with the tabs. The pros are that they have held their fair share of poop & pee for those times that my daughter's had an accident, but I'd rather stick with the Pampers as far as fit & styling go."
2,"Huggies pullups are great, but the ""cool alert"" not worth it!","While I would give huggies Pullups in general a great review, as they work very well on my daughter, we tried these ""cool alert"" ones because we thought they might convince her through uncomfort to not have any accidents. They not only did not work, but even I couldn't feel the ""cold"" when I took wet panties off her. Completely not worth the extra money: stick with the cheaper, regular Pullups version (I think they're called ""learning designs"")."
3,Okay but occasional leaks,"I'm not overly impressed by these pull-ups - they leak (urine) from time to time and the ""cool alert"" doesn't seem to have any impact. They are also pretty expensive. Although I prefer Pampers diapers in general over Huggies - I like the easy open/close sides on these rather than the tear away on Pampers pull-ups. So, although they aren't a home run in my book -- I'll continue to use them on my daughter."
5,Ivy leaf bowls,Excellent finish!! They seal very well. Metal seems very durable. Perfect match with other Callaway items.
2,Terrible! Marineland 220 filter,"I purchased this Marineland 220 filter for my small 30 gallon turtle tank and it is terrible! The flow is horrible, you have to press a button many many times in order for it to start, if it starts. Just terrible.I have a Fluval FX5 canister filter with my 90 gallon cichlid tank and it's amazing. I should have spent the extra money to purchase another. Now after trying to clean the motor, a piece snapped off.If you're getting it for a turtle tank, don't. I would not recommend it for a fish tank either. It's just too difficult to put together and get it going. Plus you have to clean it every week or two. If you want to save time, buy the Fx5 canister filter. I clean it once every 4 months. The Marineland 220, every 2 weeks at best.I wasn't impressed and will definitely not purchase a product from them again. I suppose, you get what you pay for."
1,I wish I never bought it,"I should have read the reviews and done my homework before buying. When its working properly it does keep my tank very clean but to many hassles to deal with in using it. In the 6 months I've owned it, the thing stopped working 3 times. Clean up is a waterery mess. The top hose on top of the unit keeps leaking. The side clamps keep falling off and feel as if they are made of a very weak plastic. As a whole I think its a piece of junk...wish I never bought it. I went back to PetSmart where I bought it and they do not stock any of the materials used in the filter. I wonder why...I also could not find it in stock any longer at petsmart...I wonder why?"
4,Great basic laptop.,"I purchased the Laptop from a local Best Buy about a year ago. Since then I have had absolutely zero problems. If you're looking for an inexpensive laptop for basic stuff, this more than fits the bill. I mostly use it for audio/video playback, audio/video conversion and overall web surfing and basic MS Office.The battery life is average at best (with WiFi turned off and screen dimmed). It should also be noted that I threw in an extra 1gb of RAM. A bare minimum of 1gb is needed no matter was OS or hardware configuration your using.Overall it's a great ""beater"" laptop. This thing has taken so many hits / drops and has always bounced back (literally)."
2,I NOW HAVE A RATHER EXPENSIVE LAP DESK,"My wife and I purchased this laptop a year and a half ago. It was our first laptop after years with the desktop models and we thought we had done pretty good research. Within a month the CD/DVD drive quit working altogether, then the earphone housing completely fell apart and 1 month after our extended waranty ended the screen began doing really strange things. Now it is no longer doing strange things because it is doing nothing at all. To fix the screen would cost more than it would cost to just buy a new laptop, so this pile of junk now serves as my dinner tray. To sum it up, we purchased a back pack carrier for this at the same time we bought this expensive computer and the back pack is still in great shape a year and a half later despite constant use. I recommend the Swiss Gear back pack but not this laptop."
2,Unexpected crashing and customer service is horrible.,"I got this laptop as a graduation gift, and I had it for under a month when it crashed. I took it in to Frys Electronics to have them look at it and try to figure out what was wrong with it, and the hard drive was bad. I emailed and called HP/Compaq many times, and I finally got them to send me a new hard drive. I had to wait almost two weeks for the hard drive to arrive, and when it did, there was no operating system. I then called HP again and they said they ""Forgot to put the recovery cd in with the hard drive."" So I finally get that and now my laptop is working fine (for now).I will never tell anyone to buy an HP/Compaq product ever. They have absolutely horrible customer service, and it's just completely not worth all the trouble."
3,Compaq Presario C50272 15.4 Notebook PC,I was not a happy camper when I found out the Vista Basic soft were expired after 30 days. I purchase the computer with the intentions of having the software not a trial bases.
3,Very Slow laptop,"I have the same issue as some others here. Very slow processor. I thought it was because there was so much preloaded stuff on this laptop when I bought it, but the truth is, it's just slow."
1,Oh please,Yet another lame attempt to capitalize on mythic falsehoods. Don't waste your time- check out anncoulter.org or davidlimbaugh.com instead.
3,Obliviously On He Sails,"I was really excited to read this book. The concept sounded original and hilarious, and I was so sure I'd have a good time reading it. While reading, I found out that the poems were originally broadcast on a weekly radio show. This was a great idea. I would have much rather heard the poems in context with the world's events, rather than randomly combined in one book. I can understand someone wanting to read this after having heard the poems on the show, but other than that, this is definitely one of those books you want to pick up at the library, instead of purchasing it. I did enjoy the poems for the most part, although I really would have loved it if each poem had a blurb accompanying it, explaining the backstory behind the poem, as I found myself completely unfamiliar with the content of some of the poems."
5,THE SOCIETY IN RHYME,"CALVIN TRILLIN DESCRIBES, WITH SUPER WORD CHOICES, OUR PRESENT LIVING STATUS PER SE."
1,Two can play...,"There once was a man named TrillinWho's poems and books made a killin'He sang to the choirAnd swung on a wireAs the Liberals his poison were swillin'Trillin told his stories in rhymeHe cooked tales spicier than thymeThe Libs would guffaw'Til their knees were so rawFrom rolling around in the grimeBut the Truth had it in for old Cal'Cuz Trillin was never Truth's palWill Cal take a tumbleWhen he and Truth rumble?Yeppers he will, I know he shall"
4,A great American humorist,"How can you not love Calvin Trillin? Wise, funny, an American treasure. This book will delight all of us who watch this administration in shock and awe and yearn for some levity. To whomever it is that suggests we visit anncoulter.com (yikes!!) I can only say, lighten up."
5,more obliviously by the minute,"Trillin is spot on with his poetic mockery of El Presidente Busho. It just gets worse. Can another book be far off? I laughed. Now, I'm weeping. This guy is one bad President. The Democrats took over Congress with an anti-war voter surge and Shrub wants to send in more troops? Sad. Our soldiers are dying and this guy wants to send more?! He is so OBLIVIOUS to reality."
3,Interesting and thought provoking,"We spend almost a third of our life working, yet so many of us aren't happy with what we do. Joanne Gordon, author of Be Happy At Work, spent over a year searching for women who love what they do. Gordon has identified three themes and ten categories of happy working women. The 100 women come from all walks of life. Some are famous and some are everyday women. She tells their stories in a lively and straight-forward manner and discusses why they are happy and how we can achieve that same happiness in our own lives.I liked Gordon's bullet point definitions and descriptions. They were easy to find, read and refer to again. The stories are inspiring. If you're not happy at work, you might want to read this book - and then spend some good old-fashioned thinking time about what you can do to change your situation."
1,Disappointed.,Wow. The table of contents was a turn off from the start:....masturbation....homosexualityand then INTERRACIAL DATING?Is interracial dating really listed in the table of contents as an issue that needs to be addressed along with masturbation and homosexuality. Seriously?
1,Good for a laugh,"He's so full of himself (with no reason to be). What does the Bible say about that?His talk about God and Satan is rather sickening. He writes like what he says is truth when he is actually just writing ""facts"" the way he interprets them from the Bible.I'm sorry but I don't take anyone seriously when they pick and poke at quotes and claim they know exactly what the Bible means."
4,Purchased as a gift,"I purchased this book as a gift for my sister-in-law who is studying for her Environmental Science degree.Given that the book was not for me I can only review the basics.I have given the book 4 stars purely because I cannot confirm the adequacy of it's content, though it appears very good to the layman's eye:- Nice, strong binding.- Attractive and well presented.- Perfect palm size- Appears very thorough in content- Great priceI'm happy with my purchase - and so was my S.I.L."
1,Cheep looking,Cheep lookingThe mugs are a bit smaller than regular coffee mugs. They have rough edges that I find irritatingAnd the picture on the site shows paint much darker then on the cup. I do not recommend buying it if you care about quality of your china.
1,mugs thin and fragile,"this came with one already broken in the box, they are thin and fragile like a teacup, not substantial like you would think of a mug. i would not buy them again."
1,Very dissappointed!!,"I really wanted to have these mugs and was very excited to receive them. Unfortunately, when I did, two of the four mugs were broken. I sent them back and received a second package with every one completely broken. The sellers do not take care of the packing and do not protect the items properly. I asked the post office why dont they manage packages carefully, but they informed me that according to the way the items are broken is because the sellers send them already broken. What a shame!!. I really wanted to buy the entire china as I really love it, but under these circumstances I am sure I will never receive it complete!."
1,Beware - Another Story of Broken Mugs,"We read the reviews that there were problems with the packing of these mugs but took a chance hoping we were going to be the lucky ones. Not so lucky. Six of the twelve cups were broken!! We like the cups and want twelve but are very uncomfortable ordering more to complete the set because the process of returning, getting a credit and then reordering is frustratingly too much work!! And there is a good chance we won't get 6 unbroken mugs on the second go around!Yikes. What to do??!!!I am very disappointed and think this known problem should be corrected and the cups should be replaced at no charge in the name of good customer service and good will."
4,Not bad for the price,"I ordered the mugs, sugar & creamer and teapot and just got my order. The infuser was broken but since I use tea bags or my metal infuser it wasnt a problem. While the transfers are a little fuzzy the colors are really good bright white and crisp cobalt. The mugs arent the heavy clunky kind thankfully. Overall while the sellers could definitely beef up their packaging alot I'm happy with my purchase. Buying from this company will however be risking a return due to breakage."
4,Blue Willow mugs,The mugs were received in perfect condition and I was more than pleased with the quality for the price. The teapot is equally great. I am planning to order additional sets of the mugs.
2,Just ok,I should have paid attention to the reviews...they come to you broken. One handle was broken. Seller should repackage these before shipping them to customers. The design is fuzzy but they blend ok with what I have.
4,You can go no wrong with Nightmares on Wax,"I've been into this chillout groove rhythms that seems to be flourishing in the DJ scene. N.O.W. is definitely one of the pillars for ambient chillout drum & bass kind of tempo. Only Kruder & Dorfmeister, Tosca, Thievery Corporation, and Fila Brazilia can be compared with this type of music. Very, very for the eclectic crowd..."
4,100% underrated CD!!,"This is my favorite by Lena!!Fabuous songs and arrangements!I have own this in LP, casette, and two CD's and never had I got tired of this. I am always looking for a remastered version of this extraordinary CD!!I have followed it around for 30 years and wait patiently for the remastered to hit the limited market."
2,This was a disappointment,"I bought this because I was in the middle of a Gabor Szabo jag. I had seen him perform twice, once in a very intimate setting, and was very impressed with his playing. When I came across this album and read the write-up about how he and Lena Horne ""clicked"", I figured I had to have this. In listening to it, I would consider it pedestrian at best. It's not really jazz...it's almost Broadway show-like...or more like some of the over-produced popular music albums of the time...not my cup of tea. It's not gypsy jazz or anything approaching it--to be honest, I don't think Szabo played gypsy jazz...at least not the gypsy jazz that one associates with Django Reinhardt."
5,Where's Season Two?,"I really enjoyed this mini-series. I want to find out what happens to the characters since I've invested myself in the story line. What happens to Sam? What about the guard and her grandmother? And Cricket's husband - does he get ""caught"" in his deception? These stories and more I would love to see completed.I also love the humor - sometimes very subtle (girls lunch out) and sometimes laugh-out loud (remember ""Bambi""?). But the story has, as someone else has already pointed out, heart. It's a wonderful story that needs to go on!Buy this video and watch it frequently. You'll get something different with each viewing."
5,"Witty, intelligent, masterful multiple entendres everywhere","This is a smart, fun series. Big name actors, great sets, story lines that are just over the top enough so you don't always burst out crying when one of the characters experiences a stab to the heart. It has a lot of froth on top of substantial material - you can pick and choose the levels you feel like indulging with any given episode. It looks as if the actors are genuinely friendly, they're ""generous"" in that way that great actors seem to be. Nobody hogs the stage, no one character is so overwhelming, the rest are reduced to bit players. This is an adult comedy, as real as an axiety attack, as flippant as a revenge heart attack. They go for the funny bone and hit it - often. It's one of the few series I'd buy in DVD form because there really is more content underneath the obvious. I could watch it again. I wish it had gone five years. It deserved to."
5,This is Television at it's best!!,"Debra Messing and supporting cast/ensemble cast is absolutely stunning in this romantic comedy about a woman who faces her life after realizing she was just a ""starter wife"" for her up and coming famous husband. As he moves on to younger and more beautiful women, she must learn to adjust and eventually flower into who she really is.Excellent, Smart, Sophisticated, Entertaining!!"
4,Can a guy review this without choking?,"Sure. It's not bad. This is not a show I'd would have considered on my own or even remembered to watch. My wife was watching & I stopped for a moment & stayed because Debra Messing is so excellent- fashion, comedy & drama. It's not marketed to us 50+ males but is a perfect, summer mini-series. It went to dvd pretty quick in case you missed it. I'd recommend it. Debra's scenes with Joe Montegna are the best."
3,Good Trash,"Starter is some of the best trash on television, light and fun, full of Hollywood insider tidbits, the wife and I laughed with Debra Messing and her pals. Even the ethnic and Gay cliches did not annoy."
5,chick flick!,"Oh ya, this is a fun chick flick that I will tuck away & watch again & again. Funny, fresh, not a repeat of story told & the actress is charming"

4,Go ahead and get this if you've got some extra money.,"I got this CD a while back because I am an electronic music artist, and I like doing remixes of any sort of out-of-the-ordinary thing I can find. This CD was great for getting samples from, and good bass lines. Deffinetly stuff you can groove to...Or be creative with. I got a lot of use out of it, and for some people who want to get into sample recording and looping and things like that, I've found porno music to be a very good starter. It's easy to start off with, and once you learn more, you can be completely creative."
5,Really beautiful,"I found ""The Homeric Hymns"" the most satisfying version of these ancient myths I have read; far superior to modern prose retellings. Thelma Sargent's elegant translations of these poems inspire a great sense of the sacred. The longer poems, especially ""To Demeter"" and ""To Hermes"" also develop a sense of the personalities of the gods. Those who love Homer's epics will also love these short poems, even if scholarship has taken the honor of authorship from him."
5,Wood worker,"Big improvement over the orig. bag with the added window. Now you can see when the bag is getting full instead of feeling the bag like I do because I have my collector mounted up high. The elastic bag loops seem to be of a better quality then the old bags so putting on the new bag is much better, it doesent fall off before you can get the band tightend. Its a bit pricey but if your collector isnt easy to get to it's well worth it over having to mess with those plastic bags that you have to tape on in order to hold it in place while you tighten the bands around it."
2,Not that great,"I thought this got pretty good reviews, but it really wasn't that great. Everybody mentioned the cake episode, I thought it was kind of stupid. I wouldn't advise anyone to go run out to buy this."
3,"Good history, opinionated and dry in places","In this famous book, the historian Gershom Scholem goes through the history of Shabtai Zevi: the man who, in the seventeenth century, convinced the majority of world Jewry that he was the messiah and then converted to Islam to save his own life. The story is fascinating, and Scholem probably knows more about it than almost anybody else in the world. Although the book is a ""historical"" book, not really intended for casual reading, it is stirring in parts and not that hard to get through. Scholem has definite opinions about Shabtai -- e.g. how great a part Kabbalah played in the movement, whether he really believed in himself as the messiah -- that not all historians would agree with. Still, this is a worthwhile book."
3,Sophisticated Map Book,I was looking for a rather straightforward introduction to maps for my grandson who had an assignment is his 4th grade class. This is not what this book is about. Rather it is a rather sophisticated look at all the different type of maps that are used. The author uses each of the different type of maps to teach geography about various parts of the world.
1,Worst $16 + time I've ever spent,"I'm not sure what these reviewers giving 5 stars were reading, but it clearly wasnt this book. The entire first few chapters talks about how great this book will be as it to build up to some greand and monumental information, only there is no climax. Only common knowledge such as ""talk to rich people to learn about how they got there"", ""think positive"" , or "" buy audio tapes or successful people"". There was a 3 page segment on why audio tapes were better than audio cd's. I mean c'mon give me a break here. 90% of this book was filler, the rest of the 10% was filled with common knowledge.As a side note, there is no explanation as to how the author became a millionaire, and Google results show nothing either. Questionable to say the least. While the saying goes, ""dont judge a book by a cover"", this book does not fall under that category. The book is indeed as ugly as the cover."

4,Decent quality item that came with a damaged top,Overall the quality is OK. My daughters vanity came with a damaged top. I sent an email to the company and the reponse was that I had to wait 12 to 18 weeks for a new top to the vanity or send it back to amazon. I opted to wait for the new top and built the unit as is. My daughter wanted the vanity in her room so I built it in about 1 hour. All the other pieces to the vanity were fine. I would recommend this vanity. Easy to build and the instructions were easy to follow.
1,"beautiful vanity, just no legs","The vanity is beautiful would have loved it but when we opened the shipping box the two long legs on the bench end were missing. After many calls and e mails I have received no reply with any kind of resolution. I received one e mail stating that I would hear something in 3 days, and that was 10 day ago. I am very disappointed with my first order with amazon and this supplier."
2,overstated,"Got this because I thought it might give me extra tools to improve writing my long fiction.It starts with a fine idea, but quickly runs out of power. The idea? Well, fairly basic.

2,Not to My Taste,"This set of movies contains silent movies directed by Murnau- considered to be one of the best moviemakers in movie history. To be blunt, I did not like them. I found the pacing of these movies to be very slow and the plots not interesting. I will not recommend this set."

SAVE YOU MONEY AND PAINT YOUR WALLS...THEY WILL GET MORE VIEWING TIME THAN THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
2,magnavox 51mp392h,I owned this tv for less than two years and it has already went out. The color on it has went crazy and left arks all over. I called to see about repair and said it would be a minimum of around five hundred dollars. I am going to take that money and buy another brand of tv. Stay away from this tv!!!!!!!!!!!
5,AWESOME TV FOR THE MONEY,"I've had this TV for more than 5 yrs. and it is still working like it should. It's definitely outdated now, but when I bought it, it was the best deal for the money. Picture looks great, it's still bright and crisp. The viewing angle is awesome. It's viewable with the lights on. I guess I just saw some of the those bad reviews and decided I better give my experience with it."
4,Excellent although too salty,"These arrived nice and fresh, but even though I'm a real salt lover, they have too much salt on them for my taste. I suppose I could put them in a strainer and shake them. But it would be better - and for many people salt is a health concern - if they weren't over-salted.The packages have a notice on them that suggests refrigerating or freezing. That is good thinking. Anything with high natural fat content can easily become rancid over time, especially at higher temperatures. So when buying the small case of these things, it's wise to keep in mind your storage capabilities."
3,Not a fan,These have such a weird chemical taste to me. I ate maybe a handful before enthusiastically giving them away to my neighbor.
2,One time use only,"This tap was very brittle and did not take to re-grinding very well. I only had to use it to tap one hole in SST and it broke multiple times. It did eventually re-tap as far down as I needed to go, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great CD !,"This album by MAE MOORE has been released in 1999. I bought it directly from the artist, a few months before it came to the record stores (that's why I got the cd with a different booklet cover from the one you might see on this page). Needless to say, this is a great CD : music, lyrics, and vocals by an inspired songwriter and musician. On this album, Mae Moore got some help from Jann Arden, not the least of it in terms of production and backup vocals. By the way, the 'Big Hip' record label is signed Jann Arden; they have also released some stuff by Lin Elder. In sum, Mae Moore deserves five stars for some excellent singing, such as 'Free to love me' or the jazzier 'Only man on Coney Island', one of her best songs ever. The music arrangements are also noticeable. Although different, I think the album is on a par with 'Dragonfly': they do not have the same colors, but both recordings unveil beautiful musical journeys."
5,I Thought My Family Was Dysfunctional,"A few years back it was the IN thing to talk about how dysfunctional our families were. Then after a while we learned that all families were dysfunctional. It was indeed a wonder that any of us made it to adulthood. But while my family was indeed dysfunctional, it was a model of sanity compared with this one.Barely surviving himself, Nick Flynn was working in a homeless shelter in Boston when his father came in off the streets searching for a warm meal and shelter. It was the second time that Nick had met his father in 25 years. From this beginning a relationship is built. It was difficult, struggling, but still a relationship.A book generating uncommon feelings as the two men go through life."
4,Having lived on the streets of Las Vegas...,"I can tell you that this author has embellished little. I avoid four letter words in my books simply because I think they distract. Nevertheless, I understand Flynn's reasoning here, and at least for me, the language in this book was palatable. What I found most interesting about this work was how different street living is in Boston compared to Las Vegas and East Los Angeles. Then East LA is a 24/7 war zone. While Boston and Las Vegas are similar in the fact that it's the police in these two cities you had better be wary and respectfully of; in East LA, as bad as the police are, badges are a welcome sight compared to MS-13."
2,Bor. Ing,"The title insinuates that this will be a funny, engaging read. No. It is told in a weird ""tidbit"" style that can't pull the story together enough to make you care about lives that would otherwise be really interesting, albeit in a mostly tragic way. The title promises a night in Suck City, and now I know that the author meant that very literally."
4,"down and dirty title, down and dirty story","This is a story, ultimately, of redemption. Flynn's a poet, and the language here is stark and strong. Sometimes he gets a little high-falutin, like the chapter that's all one word sentences, but overall he's not sentimental, and not too tough either-you get the sense that he's just trying to get his book out-and it's probably not a whole lot different that the book that was basically killing his dad all those years.So many memoirs are out there written by people who don't actually have a story--Flynn does."
4,Gritty and raw,"Mr. Flynn lays it all bare in this beautiful, raw and gritty memoir. He seems to spare no pain and touches on every difficult emotion he must've felt in bringing this memoir to life. I cannot begin to imagine the depths of pride his mother might have felt had she been able to read and appreciate her son's organic talent for writing."
4,good writer/interesting tale,"Flynn is a poetic writer who provides an honest retelling of his life story. This book is sad at times, but not depressing. Definitely worth reading."
5,Honest and Straight-forward,"I love Nick Flynn's writing style. He is a poet who has written a book about his life, and mostly about his father's life, who fancies himself a poet also (though the jury is still out on that).Nick worked in a homeless shelter for years where he ran across his father who was either living on the streets or in the shelter. His father eventually gets a little apartment and Nick visits him occasionally to check up on him. The conversations with his father are hilarious -- although that might not have been the intention.The book is well written. It does not attempt to make excuses for the father's alcoholism or homelessness. It also doesn't attempt to make excuses for the fact that Nick did not pro-actively get his father off the streets. It simply relays the facts in a straight-foward manner of an off-beat and bizarre life.Bottom line: Excellent book and quick read. The book reads like poetry; it is beautifully written."
5,Conjoint Measurement - Review,This is an excellent book on Conjoint Analysis. It was easy to read and understand.
2,insurance abilling,Just as advertised; I just hadn't checked the publish date--2001. I need to be more astute.
4,interesting,"I know that this is a text book ,however the subject is boring enough as is perhaps the writer could have made the subject matter more interesting. However from a student point of view its a good book to learn from."
5,My First Phil Woods Album,"My eight grade band director suggested I buy this album (originally released in 1979). This album continues to be one of my favorites. Not only is Phil's playing great, but I love the fact that he composed and dedicated each song to those who had a major influence on him. With that being said, I was able to then explore Phil's influences and broaded my own jazz library in a more educated manor. If you can find it, get it. You will not be disapointed!"
2,Interferes with USB accessory cord,"FYI...tried this aluminum case on two different iPODs and it interfered with the cord contact on the USB accessory cable for a 4GB 1st generation Nano and for an 8GB 2nd gen Nano. The plug goes in but not fully, and the slight gap (due to the hard case) was enough to prevent an FM adapter from working. Took the Nano out of this aluminum case, used a soft sleeve and it worked perfectly. THEIR description says you don't need to remove it to access the port, but 2 users couldn't make it work. It's attractive, thought it would give superior protection, but all you can reliably use with it is the earbud cord. Stick with the sleeves.."
1,Parenti,"I would personally not recommend this book. Mr. Parenti seems to have combined a dozen book summaries into this one book. Topics run wild and the short arguments are not backed up by anything but blatantly obvious manipulations of statistics. Mr. Parenti seems to be displeased with everyone and everything that has to do with America. As a leftist, he gives us a bad name by putting down EVERYTHING the right does and praising (as one does to God) the left. His arguments are not fair criticisms nor are they very convincing. The topics give a tremendous opportunity for some great discussion but unfortunately it was missed"
5,A wonderful read!,"IN THE COMPANY OF ANGELS is a lovely, thought-provoking, and haunting story. I couldn't put it down, and found myself rereading passages that were brilliant and moving. I absolutely loved the scene with the Commander in the chocolate factory, the description of the truffles on the white paper lace--visually horrifying. The settings, the circumstances, the action of the characters are so telling, so real. Ms. Kelby has done a beautiful job weaving this magical story together. Tying up all the loose ends, staying true to the theme, describing the horrors of the holocaust in a subtle, yet compelling manner, all the way to the more than satisfying conclusion. I look forward to reading her next novel."
3,Not an Easy Read,"Perhaps it is only me, since ""In the Company of Angels"" gets rave reviews. But I found the book thin, lacking in compelling plot, but definitely poetic as one reviewer stated. It does have a beautiful cover but I found the sentence structure tedious and too repetitive. It's the author's first book apparently and that might explain her stage fright, her fear of loosening up. She'll do better next time I'm sure. And for many readers, she's already done well enough."
3,Good wrench set for a non-humid climate,"My wrench set started rusting after just 2 months of light use at the RC track. If you're in a humid state, you might want to look at another wrench set, or keep this one on the bench in air conditioning.The quality is pretty good, the bits are sturdy and don't strip out under high torque. I have had some issues with the hex nut holding the bits into the handles loosening, but that is an easy fix provided you have another set of wrenches around."
4,A very cosy read.,"This book is a very good ""Aga Saga"". The characters and descriptions are cosy, and enjoyable. If you are a Rosamunde Pilcher fan, then add this one to your reading list. It's comparable to that genre. I read the first book that Willet published in the United States (A Week in Winter), and I liked it enough to purchase some of her others from Amazon.UK.. I am glad that she is publishing here, and will look forward to reading more."
4,"Same book as ""Forgotten Laughter""","If you are a fan of Marcia Williett as I am, and if you have been purchasing books from Amazon UK, you may already own this book. It was originally published as FORGOTTEN LAUGHTER, but the American edition was given a new title."
1,South Beach Flawed.,"Just bad grainy video of live performances from the worst rappers in my Opinion Jay-Z(no talent-Pac was Right),Ja Rule,Beanie Segal,Diddy Pitty and Lil Kim(nasty) and Badboy, then you have some annoying ""Lola"" as host, And it's not even on South Beach(I am a Native I know you out of towners your not welcome)The Suntrust building in the background? Downtown, And it's at Bayfront Park. Watch it on Netflix, it's boring and it's not Hipohop."
2,Nothing Raw About !!,"Total disappointment, nothing raw about this DVD. Just live performances from the past, not even up-to-date. I gave it two stars just for showing one of the late great Aaliyah's last performances, I loved her. Nothing to talk about though, I got cheated out of my money. DAMN !!"
3,NICK,AS MUCH AS I LIKE NICK DANGER THE CD I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON THEMSELF IS A CDR. IS THIS A BOOTLEG?
4,Highly recommended!,This music takes me back to colonial England or Early America and really puts me in the Christmas spirit. Bring on the figgy pudding and wassail!
3,Lovely but anachronistic,"I only listened to a few of the mp3 previews, but it was enough to raise for me one very serious question about this CD: where did that nice big acoustic come from? Exactly what building with acoustics like that existed in colonial America? Most public buildings (at least those in which music would have been played) in Colonial or post-colonial America were smallish, wood frame buildings with dry acoustics (I know - I worked in one for nine years). The luxurious acoustic enveloping these lovely tracks seems quite anachronistic. I think Barry Phillips got it better with his 2008 CD, Colonial Christmas, which is instrumental but recorded in an appropriate (e.g., mostly dry) acoustic. It's still very effective."
1,Niche market,Grates on the nerves-not something you can play repeatedly and of course it is seasonal. Worse by far is the awful singing. At least with the instrumental you can stand it-the shirieking voices not so much.
5,House Music Lovers Rejoice,While there are plenty of avenues of house music this complilation it the main thoroughfare. Classic House Chicago style as only true house heads know. This doesn't disappoint. Enjoy DaBum
4,What a bizarre movie!,"This was loaned to me by a friend--mostly because my friend knew I liked Teresa Wright. I had never heard of the film before, so it was a ""pleasant"" surprise.The movie is truly bizarre as it starts out like a nice little drama (complete with your pretty little music) and turns into something a lot more sinister. It is very difficult to review this movie without giving away half the plot, so let's just say that the acting is good, and the plot is surprising (if somewhat gruesome).The picture quality is not the best, but this was a TV movie back when TV was not Hi-def! This film is cheesy, short, suspenseful and worth your couch time!P.S. Teresa Wright is getting old, but she is still as charming as ever--and the voice hasn't changed at all. I just love her!"
3,Don't Depend Solely on this Map,I was excited when I got this map but when I was in mexico it was a bit of a let down. THe city maps are poor so you may want research the maps of particular cities you will visit. The route numbers tend to disapear into one another and Toll Roads (Cuota's) Aren't Numbered.It's a good overview of the country's Highway System. but I don't recomend it as your soul source of navigation.I bought it based on someone else's review of the other major Mexico Atlas but I haven't seen that map to compare.Lesson:dont take reviewer opinions too strongly - they already do that themselves. And apparently some people just don't like certain publisher's.
1,Oh my...,"I'm sorry Peter Ames, I'm sure you've worked hard on this project... but this has got to be one of the funniest (as is pathetic-funny, not funny funny) videos I have ever seen. I found it painful to watch the 56 second demo.I would never buy this DVD and I doubt many people ever will (Other than your mother and possibly your closest friends.) Hell, I would be insulted if it was handed to me as a gift. In fact, I would probably use the DVD to light a Christmas fire if it was given to me goodheartedly by my loving grandmother.I mean come on, would YOU pay for this crap? I doubt it. This is bad stuff. Bad. Very bad. Very, very bad stuff.If you want to sell even one copy, I STRONGLY recommend you take off the demo from the site, you'll scare off potential fish."
3,Not for advanced users!,"Pretty good book in general. I'm an intermediate computer user and I have to say I didn't learn to terribly much from this very large extensive product. For advanced users I wouldn't recommend it, for beginners looking for info on basic troubleshooting and building of pc's I would recommend it. A large wealth of the history of computers, and other now obsolete information that I'd rather not waste my time or brain capacity with. Also EXTREMELY BIAST on Intel products, basically giving less info on AMD chipsets mobo's and processors, and treating AMD like it's not worth the space in this 1500 page book. Let's face it, if your building your own PC, your probably gonna shoot for an AMD processor, for it's specs and it's value of the buck."
5,opened to the bone,"Moravia's writing which I would not have encountered were it not for these elegant new paperback versions of his work is open to the bone. His honest revelations through his all too human characters are poignant, pointed, and penetrating. To any one interested in looking deep inside themeselves and their relationships: I recommend Contempt. Prepare to squirm."
1,where did this come from,I dont even know how this showed up at my house or how it got ordered. Who would buy a cd single. I was scammed and paid for it though
4,"It does the jobs, but it can be better","I bought the Shuffle to my wife because she does not want to deal with the menu. The simple nature of the Shuffle makes vendors harder to build the dockable speakers with good features. I really give credits to the iHome to spend the efforts to make iH18 a real dock for Shuffle. That's why I gave the product 4 stars. Here are my comments:Things I like1) Many Shuffle speakers are using the headphone jack as the audio out, but iH18 uses the USB port that will change the Shuffle while it is playing. It never runs out of battery.2) It comes with the AC/DC power supply.3) Very simple operation. It's really plugn and playThings I dislike1) Speakers are not loud enough.2) No FM/AM radio3) The on/off button shuts off the speakers only, it won't turn off the Shuffle to stop playing songs.I can totally bear with those dislike items since the price is so good. I like it."
1,A piece of junk,"My son received this product as gift. When I plugged it in, nothing happened (apparently the quality control team was on vacation the day that this one was built).I called ""customer service"" and was told that this model was not a good one and that I should buy a different model.I choose not to do business with a company with poor products and poorer ""customer service."""
1,very poor quality,"I purchased the iHome radio/recharger system for my ipod, specifically to listen to and recharge ipod at my photo studio. I would have liked to have known that the speakers required batteries. The sound was tinny and weak. The only redeeming feature was the recharging dock. I returned the system, which in and of itself was a huge hassel. The seller, Orangeonions, took forever to respond to my request for an RMA..and in fact I had to make two requests. I'm still waiting to see my refund. Would not recomment this product or the company."
3,Won't work with new Shuffle,Nice little gadget. I purchased it for my son ( 11 year old ) because I wanted to make sure he kept the Ipod shuffle to charged up but still could hear his music. It does not work with the iPod Shuffle 2. This is the new model the size of a match box.... it can play through the audio jack in the front and it will charge but as far as playing music while charging on the iPod shuffle it is a no go.
2,Elementary school level,"I ordered this book because I thought it would provide an introduction to the politics of the Dominican Republic. When I got it, it reminded me more of a mixture between a tacky guidebook and an elementary school social science book. It does present some insight into the historical, economical and political conditions of the country, some of them even differing from the mainstream image, but it is all very limited in scope and not very useful. If you want a guidebook, I'd suggest Lonely Planet a million times before this one. When it comes to a political review of the country, I have unfortunately had difficulties in finding one. But surfing the web for a couple of hours will certainly provide more useful information than a copy of this book."
3,Summary,"This book has dealt well with subjects like the economy, politics, and local places to visit. Unfortunately, I found the information on the history and cultural identity of the Dominicans to be lacking information. For example, When Howard spoke too briefly of the Taino Indians or how the Dominicans have a need to be more ""Indian"". He was totally incorrect. The author does not hold a strong enough argument or facts to support this. He leaves the reader with much confusion about the Dominican identity."
4,Not fine china!,This piece is cute and macthes in color and esign with the rest of my Mikasa Antique White Dinnerware. One thing to know is that it is earthenware and not fine china like th erest of the set so it is a little thicker and heavier.
3,"Random unexplained ranting, makes this creepy film less enjoyable","If you're looking for fun artistic expression, this is the film for you. Although, the flow of the film is constantly interrupted by small segments of the narrator rambling about what he/she is affraid of. The real issue here is that it doesn't really make any sense. I can't really understand why they felt so inclined to have these segments in their film. However, the stories in the film are original and creepy, even disturbing at some times. I think that amyone can enjoy this film. Just have the fast foward button ready for those annoying segments."
4,It has not been dead yet.,"I built a light game rig with it, it has been a working horse so far. I do not know how long it will last. Some reviewer said it only last several months. Let us wait and see. The reason I give it 4 stars is that the buffer seems a little bit too small (8 MB). My 250 GB drive has 16 MB buffer. I am not sure if the small buffer contributes the shorter life of this drive."
5,Wroked just fine,"Worked fine from the first moment. No difficulties during system assembly.System has been running for over a year - no problems - use is not heavy, though."
5,"Perfect ""first Bible"" for children!","This is the perfect ""first Bible"" for children. The pictures are bright and colorful, the handle is easy to hold and the hard back holds up to many drops!"
4,My granddaughter loves her Bible,I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter and she just loves it because she can sit down with a little help and read it herself. It has pictures that go along with every page and it gives her a good feeling to be able to read something on her own. I would recommend this for kindergarteners and 1st grade children for the reading.
3,Not the right item,"This book had belonged to someone else... & I didn't pick the right Bible so that is my fault, sorry..."
2,Badly engineered and packaged incompletely,"I had high expectations for these push-up bars since they appear to be better designed that competing products. Alas I was disappointed - but not by the design. Rather the problems are the little things.For example, the counter sunk holes require a lock washer in order for the assembler to get enough torque on the wing nuts so that the bars don't wobble. None are provided. So I had to go to Home Depot and spend additional time and money on something that easily could (and should) have been provided.Next, the wings on the wing nuts are so small that I had to get out pliers to get them torqued down tightly.Finally, because the holes are counter sunk too deeply you STILL get wobble which causes the wing nuts to loose up over time requires you to get the pliers back out for retightening.Get the picture? Pity, this product has such great potential. Perhaps they'll get it right on the next revision."
1,shaky,"The assembly is done with fairly large screws and a wing nut...but when I used the bars, it would jiggle and shake. I couldn't seem to tighten the wing nut tight enough to hold it steady.My sister said she just got push-up bars that were all one piece; no assembly required.I returned the Ironman bars..."
2,Mildly Whack,"The title of this book should have been ""Derrick Parker is the Bomb"" by Derrick Parker. He seems a lot more interested in hyping himself then really giving any insight to the murders of Pac, Biggie and Jay. He said he solved Jay's case. Well, if he solved it, why is no one in jail? There were some pretty good moments, especially his stories from Miami. I would say that 50% of the book was Parker hyping Parker, 20% was interesting information and 30% was the just some things we've all read or heard before. I hope that the fools that put down Pac, Biggie and Jay get their due, but this book does not do a lot to help the cause."
4,"Fans of Rap ""Beefs"" will love this one","If you're into rap fueds, or ""beefs,"" then this is a book you have to add to your collection. From Tupac's murder, to Biggie's, to Jay Master Jay's, Parker shares countless hip-hop experiences with the reader from his days on the NYPD as ""The Hip-Hop Cop"". Yes, the Hip Hop Police do exist - and here's your proof."
1,I am sure he has great stories to tell but he can't write,"Extremely disjointed, skips from place to place with out explanation. Reminds us several times he is the hip hop cop. It was so badly written that I had to put it down. Too bad as he has great stories to tell but needs a good editor."
5,The most comfortable fitting unit.,"I found this to be the most comfortable fitting unit I have ever used. The sound is clear and connects easily every time. I tend to try to buy Nokia branded accessories for the simple reason that their stuff is always somehow a notch above anything else you can find. However, may I say, do not lose the instructions because you probably won't remember how to pair it to a new phone! Now please excuse me while I go look for the instructions..."
4,It's not compatible with my new phone....,"I really like this headset, although it's not compatible with my new phone (LGCU500). If you have a Nokia, it's great. The music plays in your ear just like the phone when a call comes in. It has great distance. I could actually be in another room talking and it works just fine. I can't say that for Motorola.The battery life is good, also. It's a great price for a great product, I just wish it worked with my new phone......"
3,A headset for 3 months,"I bought this headset for my Nokia 6230 and it worked as expected for 3 months. Then one of the legs that support the headset to my ear broke. It didn't broke completely, only lost it's capacity to hold the headset firmly to my ear and now I'm afraid to use it because it can fall from my ear very easily."
5,Very Pleased with this Plastic Tool Box.,"Good little tool box. Sturdy, medium duty plastic case, top fits well to base, latch is secure and positive. Best feature is the back pivot hinge. It IS a hinge not just thinner plastic as seen in many boxes of this type and price range.Recommended!"
2,Not what I expected,I have a number of smallish Plano tool boxes and they are all heavy duty. This one is light duty. The heavy duty ones all have rounded corners.
4,The book was very good and informative.,"Vegetables Rock! was a very good guide. it had too many anti climaxes, but besides that, I would recomend it to anyone."
2,I was not impressed,The ingredients are very hard to find and the recipes are complicated and take much time to prepare. Not really the cookbook for an impatient teen on a schedule.
2,Not That Good,"I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment."
3,Recipes not great,"My vegetarian daughter finds in the text a wealth of informative nutrition facts, including the helpful vegetarian food pyramid.But we have tried several of the recipes and haven't found a winner yet!Better recipes (that teens REALLY love) are found in Deborah Madison's many vegetarian cookbooks."
5,Creative solution to a carnivore-parent's dilemma,"Where have you been, Ms Pierson! After struggling to find reasonable, rationale and somewhat-creative meals to feed my vegetarian/vegan teenager, this new book is a welcome gift to other omnivore parents. It is a straightforward presentation of meals without having to seek out esoteric ingredients and resort to spending your entire meal shopping effort in remote health food markets."
4,Solid CD,"This CD's title track is the much-heralded encounter between John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. In 1956, Sonny was closer to a peak than Trane. This encounter between titans, though, isn't so titanic. It's a good song, there's nothing wrong with it, but not the sum of its parts. ""Paul's Pal"" is my favorite song on the CD, it has a bright, catchy melody. ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" and ""My Reverie"" are ruminative songs, ""Beautiful Girl"" ends things nicely. All in all, a good album, and recommended."
5,Works. What more can I say?,"Made pretty well and does what it is suppose to. It's no Monster cable quality, which I think are overprice anyways. I can't think of any complaints."
1,Disappointed customer,I had the impression this product was a book. As it turned out it is a package of postcards. I was very disappointed. These post cards and accompanying descriptions had limited information and only two images per project. I had purchased this product under the misunderstanding that it was a book and I had intended to use it for preparing a presentation on Koolhaas. Not only was it not useful for this purpose but the delivery took so long that it did not arrive till after it would have been needed.
5,Something to Talk About,"I love trilogies with families and siblings, so many families have no relationships or contact. Book like this remind me of the many families without father or father that do little or nothing, but yet they make it"
2,"Tiresome to read, Difficult to finish","The 1st half of the book was okay. However by the middle of the book, the plot twists and family drama, made it tiresome to read the end. I thought the story focused too much on their family and their conflict and this detracted from the flow of the romance.This book is a perfect example of why some romance series do not work. I had read ""Let It be Me"" by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But this book is overkill on characters from other books."
5,Great read!,This author is awesome over the past few weeks I've read this entire series and I look forward to more! I am a new fan and will be for many years to come!
3,OK not the best in the series,Funny enough I found the family drama and the supporting characters more interesting than the romance story. I think this is the weakest one in the series but worth reading just to find out Adam's story.
3,Not easiest to learn with,"I purchased this book to learn to smock. It has pictures and written instructions. The written instructions are very short and not detailed. If you learn well from reading information this book will most likely not be the one for you. Treasury of Smocking by Allyne S. Holland gives better directions. There are some cute patters in here but keep in mind that the copyright on this is 1979 and that most of the patterns in this do reflect the 70's. Heavy patterns. There are a couple of patterns suitable for kids (a train, children holding hands and a basket print). If you are looking to smock a tuxedo shirt directions are in here!"
3,Key relationships missing,"As a devotee of Series One and Two, I was pleased that Series Three was finally available. Sadly, some of the key relationships that ran throughout the first two series, making them such a delight, are missing. Gone are the young chef and waiter - even Margaret is missing from half the episodes! Crabbe spends most of his time out in the field investigating - without Fisher having pulled him away from the restaurant. Henry seems to have returned to police work almost full time on his own without being forced - and his restaurant has been relegated to a supporting role. Here's hoping that Series 4 returns to the wonderful relationships of the first two series."
5,Not As Advertised,"First let me say this is an outstanding series and well worth the price. The programs provide solid doses of detective drama as well as comedy revolving around a restaurant Inspector Crabbe is trying to open and begin his second career (once he can leave the police force). I was really surprised when my order arrived (which Amazon had listed as containing both series 3 & 4) and only series 3 was in the package. Hopefully, Amazon will soon carry season/series 4 and 5 so I can complete the set."
3,Series 3 and 4??????,"Purchased Series 3 and 4 but only received Series 3. It consists of only 6 episodes for a high price. Series 1 and 2 each had 10 episodes and I now find that 3 and 4 only had 6 episodes each and Series 5 has 8 episodes but is not available in the USA. Not happy about my order showing series 3 and 4 for a total of 12 episodes. Following information from Amazon:You saved $17.50 with Amazon.com's Pre-order Price Guarantee!The price of the item(s) decreased after you ordered them, and we gave you thelowest price.The following title(s) decreased in price:Pie in the Sky: Series 3 & 4Price on order date: $53.99Price charged at shipping: $36.49Lowest price before release date: $36.49Quantity: 1Total Savings: $17.50Price was reduced because I did not receive Series 4."
4,Pie in the Sky,I find this series to be nice low key fun -- not a lot of violence or sex.The tasks Crabbe is sent to 'take care of' vary and entertaining -- it is not always a murder...The interaction of the Characters is fun.
1,Advertising Con Job,"First of all, this is a wonderful series. BUT, I preordered this in March, 2010, as a 4-disc, Series 3 AND 4 set. Yet, what has arrived is Series 3 only. My invoice states it is a 4pc DVD , Series 3 & 4. A search of the data base shows only Series 3. What happened to Series 4? I am a big Pie in the Sky fan and this is a major disappointment"
3,Beware of Quantity Issues,I ordered this product expecting a bag of 100 key rings but instead got only 1. It is listed in at least 3 places plus some of the reviews that it is for a bag of 100. That is not the case. The actual item is of high quality but I would not have ordered it if I knew I was only getting 1.
3,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie. But, it's only been a few weeks since I watched it and I can't really remember any of the characters. I realize that it's a low budget production, but low budget doesn't have to mean non-compelling characters. I can still remember just about every character in ""She's Gotta Have it"", and I watched it twenty years ago."
4,Good movie,This was definitely one of those movies you can't forget.the characters on down to the story line.
2,Watsuki never wrote this...,"This is a ok story. If you are a Kenshin junkie, you probably just get this to quench your thirst for more Kenshin. But a note of caution from me is that this was never written by Watsuki himself. These were filler episodes written by Sony to fill in the anime while the poor manga artist was contemplating what to write about for the third arc. INHM, this story lacks the continuation from the main Kenshin story and the style has changed for the worse. The previous arcs is comparable to those written by the famous Hongkong writer of swordsman novels, Jing Yong, but after the Second Arc this style just died off. Needless to say, it's because it's no longer Watsuki's story."
1,The worst Kenshin arc.,"Rurouni Kenshin: Shimabara Arc. The beginning of the worst Kenshin arc ever. Its not based on the manga, and its terrible. For some reason they decided not to make the Jinchu arc which is just AWESOME and create this one themselves. Its about a man who beleives he is the son of god etc etc, he also knows hiten mitsurugi ryu, has many followers, etc etc, stuff happens, horrible fighting, boring story. The only way you should watch this arc is by downloading it. It is NOT worth the money to buy it or even rent it, if you can manage doing that. Please do not waste your money."
3,ok so this might not be the best,"Rurouni Kenshin, a series which in my opinion is the best anime, even though I've only recently gotten into it, I still have all the dvds available at this time, and I do intend on buying the rest, this ""Tales of the Meiji"" arc will probably not be as good as kyoto, but I'm sure most of you already have heard that they have released two new OAV's in japan which will finish off the kenshin series, and also put in the final arc in the manga which features Enishi, I don't know if it will come to the US....but I certainly hope so, if not, I'm gonna have to buy a region 2 dvd player, HA. Ama Kakeru Ryu No Hirameki."
3,Ok but not perfect,"This cheese is a mystery b/c seller had no FDA label saying what we are consuming and by law they have to provide this, i asked MANY times and there's no reply re: what it is.Its 3 pounds ( 3 seperate bricks of ) smoked flavor and really expensive. ( arrives on ice packs )Tastes like motz rather than swiss. You can buy better at your local deli for a high jacked price and no info from the smokehouse seller.Its ok but a mystery food."
2,Light weight - very light duty chair,"I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too. I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport. The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair. The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless. Save your money on this one."
5,Excellent intro to VoIP,"This book does a very good job of giving an introduction to the VoIP world. As a professional in the telecom domain, I found this book very useful. Application of VoIP to telco domain as in the case of softswitch architecture for backhaul and the QoS issues that carriers have to deal with is also well covered at a good amount of detail. The book also provides detailed discussion on the protocols. However, I skipped passed these sections and unable to comment if such material was covered well.Overall - a very good book. Highly recommend it."
5,Excellent read!,"This is an excellent book for anyone who's ever worked for a large corporation (for those who wisely decided not to, here's your proof!), and always dreamed of winning the lottery. What would you do? Read this book for some good pointers on how to get your revenge! It's an entertaining read cover-to-cover."
1,I have to agree with the last reviewer,"This book was so boring. How many pages of Caitlin whining about the same thing (in between having hot sex of course) do we have to endure?I usually love Nicole Jordan's books, but this one was so slow and boring, I was very disappointed. I honestly felt NOTHING for either character. I think the same thing over and over dulled my senses. :)"
5,Inspiration in Difficult Times,"I have owned this book since it was published, but for some reason, I delayed reading it until I noticed it on the shelf. I was glad I had delayed, because the book was amazingly inspirational for me when I was in the midst of a couple of life crises. I have read theological books for years, and never once has it been as obvious as this book made it why prayers aren't always answered, and how it's not the end of the world when they aren't, and might even be a good thing. I have already shared the book with others, and we will use it as a Stephen Ministry study book. I recommend it highly for anyone in the midst of a life crisis, or coming off of a life crisis, because the content is uplifting, and the prose is like poetry. Mark Buchanan is a man who has a rare gift for writing."
1,Things Unseen,I was not impressed at all with this book. It makes me think all the more that I should write my own story.
5,"3 Evil Masters, another Martial Arts must have!","When 3 kung fu masters show up in town and start causing trouble, one man takes it upon himself to do something about. He despises their reckless use of the Martial arts and has no problem taking all three of them on, but is tricked by a supposed innocent bystander. After being critically injured, he manages to barely escape with his life and is found and saved by a student at another kung fu school. Appreciating the life saving actions of the student, he decides to take him on as his pupil and teach him how to defend himself. But the pupils skills are put to the test as he must soon avenge his teacher untimely death at the hands of the three evil masters. Solid martial arts action and a few laughs along the way!!"
4,Can't beat it for the price,"Tought myself everything I know (which isn't a lot) about home a/v from reading [..] and amazon reviews. The niles selector came recommended from on line reviews. It functions just fine and you can't beat it for the price - wish it had a remote or could be tied into a universal remote - defeats some of the purpose but it isn't that big of a deal. The knobs aren't the best, wish they turned a little smoother rather than the ""click dial"" but you get used to it (I rarely, adjust the volume). Simple install - nice quality, affordable price, can't go wrong."
5,great first chair!,"We got this for our 1 year old and she loved it right away. She quickly understood how she's supposed to sit on it like the ""big couch"". She also loves to unfold it."
1,Even though I agree...,"Read something else. This book was rife with inconsistencies and unsupported claims that only serve to erode the radicalist movement in America. On top of that, Ollman's format of periodically breaking away from his diatribe (sometimes even mid paragraph) and to reitirate another widely known study approach was confusing and served to fatally disrupt the flow of the book. The idea was nice, Bertell, but..."
3,solid construction,"This drill index is solidly made but not precision. Bits can fit in holes up to 2 sizes smaller than the proper hole. Which was disappointing because that was why I ordered it. I have a fractional index they made 35 years ago and it is still solid and accurate, so this one should last. I can't see the nano-type stamped on the bits anymore and was hoping this index would keep them sorted - no such luck."
3,"Beautiful, but whistles blows off like a bullet","A beautiful product, not functional with whistle on while boiling, as it blows off. Law suit waiting to happen. Looks not so nice without the whstle. Henkel should know better, shame on you..."
5,Melody Harp Music,This music didn't fit my harp--it is for a different brand so I had to return it. Amazon had advertised it with my6 harp but it wasn't the same.
2,"Not anywhere near as good as ""A book on C""","I purchased C++ for C programmers because I had previously purchased ""A book on C"" by the same author and really liked it. I definitely wish that I had not. This book lacks clarity because the author spends too much time introducing details which are not relevant to learning the language. For instance, he continually introduces new abstract data types and in the process completely clouds and confuses the subject in c++ he is supposedly trying to teach. The book should be renamed ""my personal tricks in c++"""
4,"Excellent, concise book, if you know C.","When I started learning C++ I looked for a clear, concise book along the lines of Kernighan's and Ritchie's famous book on C. While Pohl's book does not quite come up to that standard, it was the closest to it among the books I thumbed through in the bookstore, and has been an especially good fit for an experienced C programmer like me. It is also an easier first book for learning than Stroustrup's book on C++."
3,a somewhat scatterbrained approach,"C++ is a broad subject and can be approached from many angles. Ira Pohl's approach is so non-standard, it left my head spinning. I read this book twice and still refer to it, but Pohl's PhD.-speak keeps getting in the way. If you like to read books written using down-to-earth termonology, look elsewhere...buy if you want to talk and write like a C++ guru, just imitate Pohl's literary style."
5,Bravo JD Robb!,"MIDNIGHT IN DEATH was execllent and packed a lot of adventure into a few pages. This was the best story in the book (and the reason I bought it in the first place)... I will re-read it as is my habit when I re-read all the JD Robb books when her next one comes out.As for the other three stories: I liked THE UNEXPECTED GIFT and CHRISTMAS PROMISES enough that I will probably re-read them next Christmas when I'm in a mushy mood. A BERRY MERRY CHRISTMAS was a nice fluff piece, but I probably won't re-read it.The five-star rating is based on the JD Robb section alone.THE UNEXPECTED GIFT ****CHRISTMAS PROMISES ***1/2A BERRY MERRY CHRISTMAS *1/2"
4,A MUST READ IF.......,"...IF you are choosing this book to continue the ""____In Death"" series, then only read that story. I enjoyed the small novel which tied up a few loose ends from the last book, plus gave another spell binding story line to enjoy. The other stories involved in this collection should be taken at face value and nothing more. If you have a sweet spot for love stories, with little or no mystery in the plot, then you will enjoy this book. I have to admit I got misty eyed on the first story, but I believe in Fairytales."
3,reqad only jd robb's stuff,"there is no denying that this collection was redeemed only by the jd robb story at the end. her work alone gets 5 stars, everyone else - i don't even remember the names of the other authors. i just loved the story that comes in between ""holiday in death"" and ""conspiracy in death"". a really really good christmas story. eve and roarke rock."
4,Worth it!,"This anthology contains three excellent stories. ""Midnight In Death"", though, was extremely dry and confusing. My favorite was ""A Berry Merry Christmas"""
3,Book has been reissued!!! Sort of.,"For those of you who are interested in only the J.D. Robb portion of this book, the story was recently released in ""Three In Death"". Since I am very into the ""In Death"" series, I have made it a practice to cross check for duplicates. In ""Three in Death"" you get 3 Robb stories."
5,Love the Eve Dallas series,"When we discovered that our library did not have the complete list of J.D. Robb books featuring Eve Dallas, we immediately jumped on Amazon to order them. Love the series and now I can keep reading the books in order. Shopping Amazon is always a pleasure."
5,Great read...informative...funny...Great Documents,"This book was a great, easy read. Nothing is off limits in this biography of Washington that explores everything from his love life to the challenges of his presidency. The authors are even sarcastic and funny at times. I also like that half the book is full of documents. I found myself reading the book and when i wanted more information, flipping to the back of the chapter and looking at the documents which included washington's list of slaves, a love letter he wrote to a girlfirend in addition to the usual documents one might suspect like his inaugural address. Everything was great about this except the price. I found it in a local library to read for free but I dont think I would shell out that much for a book."
3,good idea but difficult to set & I lost instructions.,"Good concept. Like the way it snycs. the time. I need to look up directions again because it is way off time now due to kids pushing buttons. Projector works but I don't use it. This item is okay, 3 stars because of it not being easy to use/set to your time zone if you misplace your instructions. ugh."
3,Hard to Assemble,I rated it 3 stars just based on what it looks like when it's finally put together. I've wanted this certain cage for a long time now and finally got it and it took me 3-4 hours to put it together. The directions were not helpful so I had to stare at the box and figure it out. Certain pieces didn't fit well together. I had to take huge wire clippers and kind of swivel it inside of one of the pieces to make the hole bigger so the other part could fit inside it. One of the holes was blocked off by extra metal so I had to punch through that with something sharp. One hole was not able to fit a screw in so I had to tie the sides together with yarn. Definitely not for a new ferret. The ramps are a little steep. I will be putting a blanket down on both layers to cushion it since it looks like it would be a bad fall.
1,Disappointing,This cage looks like it could be great. Unfortunately the directions are not clear and the parts should be labled. I had to disassemble parts of it a few times because I put the side bars on the wrong sides causing the tray to slide in from the back. Then I put the upper level doors on the bottom before realizing they were different. Two of the welded pieces for the screw holes broke out from the tubing. Welding was broken in other places on the cage. Another piece was quite bent which I had to straighten out with pliers. Two screws wouldn't screw into the holes - like there was no thread in the hole. I had it half way assembled at this point and decided to dismantle and return it. There were just too many problems to take a chance on continuing. The welding looks very weak throughout. I found it to be very cheaply made.
3,"Bad workmanship on some parts, good cage overall.","I ordered 2 of these cages. I absolutely love them...if they would go together all the way. However the workmanship on some of the pieces is poor and they don't fit together. On two of the sides, the hole is too small and the screws can not go into the cage to secure. On the side rails (the part the drop tray slides into for litter) the part is misaligned so the cage can not even begin to be put together as it's a support. I was able to get one cage together with the interchangeable parts but now my other chinchilla is having sad times because he didn't get a new home when the ladies did.The ladies are loving their cage. I gave this 3 stars for that reason, and I'm pleased the shelving is metal and not plastic as I thought.I just wish I didn't have defective parts from each box. I'm also displeased that I took a day off from work to retrieve the cages from delivery, only to have to take another day off later to retrieve replacement parts."
4,Great Cage.,"I bought this cage for my two chinchillas. They have tons of room to run around and jump, which is great. The plastic shelves and ramps that came with it were chewed on, so I replaced them with cedar ones. The hammock is very nice. My chinchilla loved it so much he ate it. lol. The only bad things about this cage are the instructions, which are very confusing, and the wire floors. I initially wanted the wire floors so all the little poopies would fall down. I decided it would be easier than cleaning out the trays of the FN. It is great, except they poop and pee on all the things on the bottom level, which is gross. The pee sprays everywhere and everything gets all sticky. I put lots of mats and beds on the top floor to keep that from happening, but it still get lots of poop just sitting up there. It isnt that big a deal, and with a ferret it would be no problem. Overall great cage."
2,the plastic parts are cheap,"when this arrived I inventoried all the pieces and found the two plastic shelves had broken clips which hold the shelves in place, I wrote to amazon to ask for a replacement rather than return the entire unit I just needed shelves. I assembled it because I had already purchased the pets and needed to get them into a larger cage the one they where in was two small for a week or more longer to exchange the cage and have to wait. I had to put screws and washers into the shelves to make them stay in place."
3,mostly good,when the package came everything was fine except putting it together its really complicated and both of the platforms that the ramps conect to were broken along with the bottom tray
1,CAUTION! NOT SAFE FOR CHINCHILLAS!!!,"Sorry folks, but please don't buy this cage for a chinchilla. We bought one for our little darling and were quite fond of it until yesterday. She was sitting with her right rear leg extended in the morning and hopping instead of running. Her appetite was still good. We took her to the vet this morning and an x-ray revealed a broken femur. They could either put pins inside and out or amputate. After a lot of soul searching we decided to put her down. She was 15 years old but in excellent health. I've since learned that the floor wires should be no larger than 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch. (Or smaller). I measured the openings on this cage at 1/2 inch by 6 inches. This might be alright for a ferret, (I have no idea), but certainly not a chinchilla. We are truly heartbroken and wouldn't wish this horrible experience on anyone else."
4,"Good for ferrets, not great, though..","Definately an adequate size. What I received varied slightly from the photo, though. The ramps and shelves were metal, not plastic; and, solid, no holes to climb up into. Other than that, it's pretty sturdy. My ferrets seem to like it."
3,not what I expected to run into,"I was really excited to see my cage come a few days earlier. I didnt think the directions were too bad. The cage is sturdy, however the manufacturer didnt have some of the holes lined up exactly in certain spots, and I couldnt get the screws in all the way. Another thing I wasnt pleased with was the fact that no matter how I turned the second level floor where the hole was, the ramps wouldnt fit right. They were too short and when I moved the platform then there was issues with it being too close to the door. I rigged the cage to work, but it was very frustrating."
2,For a kitty behaving badly,"We purchased this cage for a kitty who won't stay house trained. We have been struggling with is for three years and have tried various methods to train him. Rather than put this sweet cat down we opted to try a cage. After a long search we decided to purchase the Peisty Farret Home due to size and ability for the cat to move between levels,and height so he could see out the windows. The floors were wire so we put down bath tub mats to protect his paws. Within 1/2 hour the ramps and trays were swinging and wouldn't stay intaked, further distressing the cat. I can't imagine feisty ferrets doing any better. You may want to consider a more sturdy produce."
4,My Chinchilla loves it!,"All in all this is a very nice cage. The directions were aweful, but with a little common sense it wasn't bad to put together.After reading other reviews I did take the time to line both shelves with 1/4"" x 1/4"" wire mesh so that he did not fall through the grating! Very time consuming to make it a safe environment for my chinchilla, but also well worth the money spent!"
1,pieces,"The cage looks great, Delivered in great condition. I go about putting it together and it went from bad to worse! The door locks are broken and can not be fixed. They were not drilled properly. The holes do not match up half of the time on the pieces. There are pieces of the wires that are bent and already broken. The cage is pratically useless to me and yet I have already spent about 4 hours putting it together! I will never order this product again! Absolutely, the biggest mess!"
2,"Loved the first two, hated this one.",I really loved the first two books and was excited to read the last one. I enjoyed the book until the end. It was rushed and much of the violence was pointless. Another reviewer suggested a fourth book. I think it is too late to save this series.
4,Good price cover doesn't fit well,"Quick service and good price. We will see how the battery holds up. The back cover snaps firmly into place, but it is about 1/8"" short and the bottom tangs don't engage on my Alltel phone. Not a big deal since I keep the phone in a leather case. If the phone was not in a case, I would be a little concerned about the bottom of the cover catching on something and getting pulled off."
1,less then one star,only get this product if you don't care that the paint peeled off with the plastic wrapper.
5,Made my worthless phone worthy,"I was getting sick of charging my phone everyday or having it just turn off during a long conversation. With this new battery i bought, the first time i charged it, it lasted a week. I was amazed. It was a big difference from the standard battery. Sure it makes it a little bulkier, but the Razr is so small to begin with, its still smaller than most phones even with the extended battery. I am not sure if they make custom cases for the Razr with this extended battery, but i just keep it in my pocket(away from my car keys) and that is the safest place it can be."
5,Entended battery fro RAZR,Great deal. Less than a standard replacement battery from your local retailer. Phone can go literally weeks without charging! Totally un-RAZR like.
2,"1100 mAh, not 1400 as advertised","Title says it all! I expected to receive the advertised 1400 mAh battery, but the one shipped is labeled 1100 mAh. Two attempts to communicate with the seller, PCMICROSTORE, were left unanswered, leading me to conclude that they know they are misrepresenting this item.Battery is still slightly better than the original 800 mAh unit which came with the phone but NOT the worth the trouble or cost."
5,Works great with Sprint V3m,This is a must if you use your razor a lot. I got this battery for my hubby and it gets him through the day. This is pretty good considering that he has a 2GB memory card of music. (He has his display set to turn off after 60 seconds of inactivity to conserve power.)
2,Battery cover is very poor quality,"only had this battery on for one day, the battery itself seemed to last a little longer, but the extended cover comes off very easily, without pressing the release button. It is a very cheap plastic, poorly made cover. I will have to spend extra $$$ for a better cover."
3,Needs better battery cover!,"I've been using this item for a couple weeks now. The battery works just fine. But the cover is nowhere near the quality of the phone's original cover. I keep the phone in my pocket with keys and change, and the replacement cover is getting chips in it along the top edge, something I've *never* had with any cell phone (and I always buy the extended capacity battery).The latch on the cover is also poor -- it's difficult to remove the cover from the phone. I'm guessing it will require ""assistance"" to come off. It could be worse -- the cover could be loose, but at least it fits the phone correctly.I bought this item because of various negative reviews of other betteries. With this item, the battery is not the problem."
1,Not worth 7 dollars,I purchased this battery 2 weeks ago. It is worthless. I charged the battery for 8 hours before the first use and it lasted less than a day. I will try to return it. Do not buy this. Pay a little more money and get one that is worth it.
3,Motorola RAZR V3c V3m Lithium-Ion Extended Replacement Battery,"Although this battery will work just fine with the Motorola RAZR V3m cellphone, it is a little bit wider than the original battery that came with the phone when I purchased it. This particular battery is for the Motorola RAZR V3c as indicated on the package it came in. Therefore, the wider case is needed to install this battery properly with the V3m cellphone, because the case for the V3m will not accommodate the width of this battery. So before purchasing this battery for your Motorola RAZR V3m make sure you can tolerate having an extra wide case. It might be worth having such a case since the original battery for the V3m is going for $49.99 on sprint.com. And the battery will last you a couple days or more without having to charge which is a plus!"
5,Great battery upgrade for the price!,I gave this 5 stars mainly due to the price versus going to a cellular store who sold me the phone and would charge more than 5x for the name brand. This 'off' brand battery does everything the Motorolla branded battery and cover would do but at a considerably small fraction of the price.No longer am I having to look for a charger after making two 5 minutes calls with the stock battery. In fact I could easily skip a night or two without even recharging.The only downside to the extended size is it does not fit my case very well but that is a phone design problem not so much the extended battery's problem.
4,Greatly increases battery life,"First of all I think my original Razr battery was dying. I could not hold more than a day standby charge and maybe less than an hour talk time.Nonetheless this battery was phenomenal on the first charge. I must have lasted 5 days with talk time in between. While the subsequent charges have not been as long, it still is a phenomenal difference between before. Now even with a bluetooth headset, I can enjoy conversations without getting low battery warnings.Asthetically it is slightly bulkier because it is quite a bit larger than the original battery. But it doesn't change the look of the phone too much aside from extending the depth.Warning though that the battery case door included is VERY flimsy. I broke the tabs when I originally got the battery because I didn't get the case in flush when installing. It was difficult to remove and thus snapped the tabs off. Amazon was great in sending me a new one free of charge. As always excellent customer service!"
4,I received 1100mAh compared to 1400mAh advertised,"If you own a RAZR v3c that has the original thin battery in it, this (non Motorola) branded battery works very well. It makes the RAZR usable again. Up to 3 and a half to 4 days standby time. I'm happy that I purchased this extended size / life battery. I received 1100mAh compared to 1400mAh advertised. The cover is also non branded, thin, and requires an extra thumb nail to open and close properly, but matches well (chips easily). A good value at around $11 or $12 w/shipping."
4,razor extended life battery,The extended life battery works as advertised. Now I don't have to recharge my cell phone every day. The battery lasts for about 5 days on a full charge.
1,Motorola RAZR V3c V3m Lithium-Ion Extended Replacement Battery,"This battery does not live up to its claims of extended life. It added few, if any, extra hours of talk time or standby yet it says it is 2X the size of the OEM battery. What gives ?"
3,Acceptable,This battery is not designed to fit like the original. It will not be flush with your phone. Battery life is comparable to original.
3,"Works fine, cheap plastic cover","This battery works fine, though it does make your nice, thin, Razr much bulkier. My problem is with the cover. It felt very cheap when I got it, but I figure d it was just lighter. After using it for about 5 months, the ""titanium black"" finish has totally worn down to it's white plastic base. So it looks terrible, but works fine What a shame.."
4,Good,"Good, just be aware that the phone will no longer be flush as using this battery will make it double the thickness of the RAZR itself!"
3,Meh,"The first few times I used my phone after charging this battery, I was extremely disappointed--it barely lasted a day. It eventually started to retain more charge over time, but the battery life is still below average compared to other phones I've owned. If your battery life is complete crap, and you're looking to improve it, this will probably help a little. I eventually just decided to scrap my RAZR and go with something else, which was a better move for me."
5,Puncher Pie and Cowboy Lies,"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Coming from the Southwest, I almost feel like I know these characters. I read a story anytime I need my spirits lifted. My thanks to the author."
3,5 stars for Jacob's Room,Touch doesn't do it for me but Jacob's Room does big time. It's musically engaging with superb vocal work by La Barbara: one of my favourite Subotnick recordings. Quite unlike anything else I've heard.
3,A Look At Wall Street From the Inside,"This is a good skewering of the financial world from a woman who was a part of it (Prins is a former director at legendary Goldman Sachs, and, last time I checked, now works for a progressive think tank). My politics aren't nearly as economically left wing as Prins. I tend to think high finance is generally a good thing, but now, especially with the implosion of the of the housing market, takign a hard look at the way this money is made is important.In this book, Prins focuses on what happened after the deregulation of the energy markets, and how that helped people like Enron do the nasty things they did. The book is a little simplistic in its rendering of good guys and bad guys, but at the end of the day, it is nice to see a left wing critque of wall street done in such a smart way."
4,Retro fit patio station,"If you are replacing the old patio intercom, then this is the one for you. It works like the indoor speaker except it is made for the out door elements. This one has worked well for the six months I have used it."
3,Okay but not as nice as others I've tried,"I tested these fabric sheets along with June Taylor, some I got at Michaels and some I bought on Amazon at VVPrints. They were better than the June Taylor and Michaels sheets, but did not hold the color as well as the ones I got from VV Prints. The VV Prints fabric sheets were also a little softer. The EQ fabric sheets would be okay for quilt labels, but for a quilt I would go with the VVPrints sheets."
1,Labels turned yellow with the first wash!,"I am really disappointed with this product. I did everything it said to do. The first ones the ink bled a lot even after leaving it to dry for over 24 hours. (Might have been my black ink though) the second ones I printed came out perfect till I went to wash something that had the label I made from this paper on it. There was nothing yellow in my washer but yet it turned colors right away. Now after the 3rd wash it looks more brown. I do not use a rash soap, I use something all natural. I just cant believe I spent so much on this to have this happen."
5,A First Rate Guide,"Within its sphere of discussion, this is the best reference manual of its type. There is a lot not here concerning RF and power, but it's not an RF or power book. Steve Lampen is about the most knowledgeable 'wire man' around and this book should go with you each time you visit your local High End audio saloon or any other vendor of these products."
5,So much information in such a small space. Best of its Kind.,"Belden is the king of cables and Stephen Lampen is a Belden Kingpin. This book is one-of-a-kind and is a must for anyone working with, or even remotely interested in audio, video, data and/or CATV cabling. It is essential, fundamental knowledge about using cables.Nope, it's not for the ""novis"" but I believe a novice will find it interesting if you understand the concept that 2 wires make a circuit. Take your time with it and Google anything you don't understand. There are some complex topics in here but nothing you won't get your head around if you read it and think about it. It is presented in a good, logical progressive order.Stephen makes it all readable with many interesting and amusing anecdotes and tidbits. The ""Grounded Dog"" story (p 363) is worth the price of the book alone.I've been in broadcast Engineering for years and this book solved a few mysteries for me.Check out the contents list to see if it's for you."
1,Not of much value.,Very little useful information. If you planning a home theatre this book really doens't offer any information on design or component integration. Very basic in it's approach with references to VCR's and other dated technology.
5,A WHITE-KNUCKLE THRILLER,"Stephen Mertz has written a fast-paced, exciting novel. Robin Curtis and her son Paul move from Chicago to the small town of Devil Creek, New Mexico, so that Robin can escape from a bad marriage. Naturally, Devil Creek harbors all sorts of dark secrets despite its idyllic appearance. The plot edges over into Dean Koontz territory at times, and Mertz's sure-handed writing keeps things popping. This is a very entertaining book. Highly recommended."
3,not really sure...,"this movie was kind of interesting, but it didn't say anywhere that there were no subtitles, so it was kind of hard to follow since my spanish is not exactly fluent."
5,nice cheap option,"I really like this little gadget. I similar alternative (custom bracket or L plate) would cost more than 300 bucks but you can get a similar performance from this stroboframe vertaflip just by adding a quick release plate and clamp to it, all below 100 bucks. Its light, very handy and does not have a lot of bell and whistles but get the job done. It has adjustable height control which you can control by moving the attachment up and down based on your camera size. It takes a snap to rotate the camera from vertical to horizontal and I have tested my camera with a center point. The axis remains center while you rotate (I have not tried with a battery grip on my camera). L plates might be better option for some people but the plates are camera specific. This one fits most modern day digital camera."
2,This product is Ok but has too much shake,"It works fine, but you definitely have to have a level on your camera. It does not lock when flipped and if outside will have shake in wind. I only use this for interiors otherwise I wish I had saved my money and gotten a panaramic head from bogen."
2,Protective cover for Motorola Razr,"I loved the color and the feel of the cover but hated the way the phone did not fit securely in the protective cover. It slid around and would keep the phone from closing completely. Took the cover off the phone after an hour, I will not be using this product."
4,A bit to much comedy but still a good begining,"If you read ""King of hell"" this suffers the same effect. Don't get me wrong it's a good manga but the comedy seems a bit forced at to many parts.Now to the characters, you get to know most of the first arc characters. Sadly most don't impress till the next volume but a good start.The fighting isn't bad but still not impressive.My recommendation is buy both volume 1 and 2 so you don't feel disappointed with this one."
4,Every last shot....,"Every last shot heard in the world of motion pictures is displayed here. From Pre-code films like LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT to the Code-in-your-face PULP FICTION, Bruce Hershenson captures the poster art of these films in splashy high quality color. A bonus is that Bruce always includes lobby card art, cherished by many a collector, but not displayed often."
5,My favorite nipple,"I (along with several other mothers) have tried a variety of nipples for bottles. The shape makes latching easy and I LOVE that Nuk provides several different flows. It helped us graduate our baby through the various stages of development. The NUK was originally given to me at the hospital by a nurse - she said the shape is more agreeable with babies who are both nursing and taking a bottle. I believe she was right. So many moms I know have had trouble getting their nursing babies to be flexible with switching between nursing and bottles. When I've recommended NUKs, I've received 100% success feedback so far from the moms I recommended it to. For the price, it's well worth trying. They do fit most bottles (don't fit Playtex or Prince Lionhearted unfortunately)."
4,Thank you!,Item is received fast and good. nicely packed and in tip top condition!will recommended to friends and relative! Keep up the good work!
5,Great nipples!,Nipples worked great for our son who was unable to get a proper latch on other nipples. It also helped deliver the milk with much less effort from him. Would recommend to any baby that needs a little help with latching or who doesn't have as strong of a suck reflex.
2,Son didn't like the Silicone Nipples,"I bought the NUK Silicone nipples as an alternative to the latex ones when I was trying to introduce bottle feeding to my already breastfed two month old. He didn't like the feel of the silicone and I really couldn't blame him, the feel of the silicone nipples is very stiff and hard; very different from a mother's breast.I switched to the latex version of these nipples and he took to that very well, possibly because these were softer. I am waiting until he is older to re-introduce the silicone nipples. Now that my son is 6-months old and has adjusted to bottle feeding, I will try to use the silicone nipples again; hopefully this time around he might be able to use them."
5,Best I Found For My Baby,I love the way these flow. My baby took them with great ease and didn't struggle or reject the bottle as she did with others.
1,There is such a thing as too fast,I have bought the medium flow and needed something just a bit faster. The difference int he size of the holes in the nipples is HUGE. I bought several of these and ended up throwing them away b/c the milk comes pouring out of the hole faster than my baby boy can swallow
4,great for 2 year old and friends,"I recently ordered this for my (almost) 2 year old, and she loves it. I think it is sturdy and very easy to assemble. Good buy for the price!"
3,Smaller than I thought,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter 3 months ago. I wanted a climber with a sandbox under it and a good sized platform and slide. There is no room under this for a sand box.It does have a nice sized slide. The frame of this is very sturdy but the company didn't put alot of attention in the platform.The platform bowed the first time my daughter got on it.I do like the real wood look that this has. My daughter does not play on this much at all. She will climb the ladder go down the slide and she is done. It is big enough for 1 child 2 at most. I would not buy this again.
2,Please dont buy this !!,I bought this for my 2 year old son 4 months ago.There is no room under this for a sand box.It does have a nice sized slide. The frame of this is very sturdy but the company didn't put alot of attention in the platform.The platform bowed the first time my son got on it.He will climb the ladder go down the slide and he is done. It is big enough for 1 child 2 at most. I would not buy this again.
4,Great climber jungle gym for young children,"I bought this climber combo unit along with the matching teeter totter. My 2 sons (1 1/2 & 3 1/2) really have a blast with it! They love playing with this unit. They have so much fun climbing the rock walls, driving the ""steering wheel?"", going down the slide, and hiding under the fort. It is made for children 2-8 so you will be purchasing something else when they grow out of it, perhaps before 8 yrs old in my opinion. I plan on it lasting til the kids are about 5 or 6 yrs old before having to upgrade to something much bigger. I think Step2 offers great quality products that are made durable & sturdy. Took only 10 minutes to put together, simple directions. You will need a screwdriver for assembly. Overall I love this product."
5,"beautiful, durable and light-weight","i purchased this climber for my 3 y.o. so right before our family reunion. all of the little kids loved playing on it (not *below* it, though), including the little toddlers.it arrived quickly, was very easy for me to snap together (except for the holes that needed to be drilled; i didn't know where to do it so my dad did it for me)and is light enough for me to drag around when cutting the grass. my son likes for me to place his wading pool under the sliding board. fun!i have only had the climber for one month, so i don't know if it will fade over time. for now, though, it still looks great. i love it and would recommend it. price is pretty good, also."
4,No complaints,"By no means super light, but it is light enough to move around the yard to mow the lawn or to move to shaded areas when necessary. I like that is it both small and big enough for my 18 month old who is 34 inches in height and which does not require me to be by her side as she plays on it.We have this on our front yard for practical purposes, that is it not in the usual primary colors - helps a great deal.Definitely met my expectations - no complaints."
5,"In and out/up and down, great of an active 15-mo. old too","We bought this for our 15-mo. old daughter, even if we knew the manufacturer's suggested age was 3 years, because our daughter was very good with climbing and slidding. The only thing we were not comfortable with was the rock climbing aspect. We put it indoor in her playroom (which is really our living room) with one rock climbing side, with the big opening, flushed to the wall, and the other side blocked with a doll cradle. We converted the bottom (which I think was inteanded for a sandbox) into a ball pit. We put plastic balls and soft blocks that had the alphabet on it, and play color identification and ""find the letter.""If you had to pick between a climb and slide and a play house, this is a great choice!"
3,Not As Great As We Expected,"After reading all the positive reviews, our parengts bought this for our son's second birthday,but we have to admit that we're a little disappointed. It's not very big or very sturdy (held together only by for bolts), and the plastic flooring bends a bit when my 23 lb son climbs on it. The crawl space is very small, and my son is already pretty bored with the whole thing. The slide is short, and not much of a thrill, but he does like the climbing walls and the wheel. Overall, we do like the pseudo-natural look, and perhaps over-time he'll enjoy it more as it becomes a base for imaginative play."
5,Very easy to put together,"When I was shopping around for a climber/slide combo for my two year old son, all I wanted to know was, ""Can I put this together by myself?""My husband is currently in Iraq and I'm a nightmare when it comes to tools, so I had to choose wisely.This ended up being a great choice. All the pieces snap together fairly easily and I didn't need to bother any of the neighbors for help. It's not stated in the directions, but I did use a rubber mallet to make the connections tighter and that made all the difference in the world.I did not pre-drill the holes for the four screws as others here have. However, had I known about that little tip, I would have.Thirty minutes after I received this delivery, I had it set up and my son was playing on it. Perfect![...]"
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased this for my 5yr old son who loves Max & Ruby. I did not read it first, but I wish I had. He loved putting the stickers on the pages, but was disappointed that the stories were not the same as his books. For example, the birthday cake Ruby makes for Grandma is not the same as in the story(strawberry instead of raspberry). Also, there is too many stickers! He could not fit them all on the clean up page, and they ended up all over the page. I look forward to more Max & Ruby, but I will make sure next time I read any future sticker books first."
1,Christian Theology,"The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter. I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism. He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years. I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead. It is an older book but much more reliable."
5,A Book In Great Condition,"The book was in great condition!No riped pages, no missing pages, no highlighter markings, and most of all, the spine was completly non-damaged.Shiping was right on time, with the book safely secure, unharmed, and clean."
2,For the Layperson,"This systematic theology is well suited for someone without any background in Greek or Hebrew or experience in exegesis. I found it simple enough that a reasonably educated person in any field of study should have no difficulty reading it and understanding the subject matter. Its not at a graduate level specialization in theology.I sometimes wonder what has happened to the great scholars such as Barth, K&D, Gesenius, etc. Back in their day and in some European countries you didn't come out of highschool without Latin, Greek and four other spoken languages. Their level of learnedness and scholasticism leaves us trailing behind today and Erickson's book as seminary material is a case in point. A person with no background in theology can pick Erickson's book up and understand it. Try that with a graduate text in mathematics, theoretical physics or chemistry."
2,Thoroughly dumbed down,I have read the three volume earlier edition. After reading 250 pages of this one my intelligence was so insulted that I quit reading it. The content is mostly fluff relative to the first edition. One example is the author telling the reader that some words have one meaning and others have several. The author is unaware that the sun will eventually run out of energy. He wonders if Adam and Eve would have lived in the garden for all eternity.The first edition is available at used book sites such as Amazon.There is a reason the used versions of this edition are available at such a deep discount.
1,"Serious scholars, don't waste your time and money,","This book is the epitome of weak writing; pathetic use of the English language, comma-splicing to the extreme, misspelled words galore, fragmented sentences, run-ons and poor presentation of material. If you're a serious theology student, look elsewhere, if allowed. I wish I could have done so. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my studies. I can't imagine why."
1,Very disappointed,"I am altering the wording of this review about since my last one upset some people, for which I apologize. I am still quite disappointed in this book, which to me is not only quite cumbersome in size, but cumbersome in academic language as well. This book was formatted for classroom use as there are a series of questions at the end of each chapter, but the questions prove to be as unweildy as the rest of the book. I would most definitely NOT recommend this for classroom use."
5,An indispensable book in your library!,"Whether you're a pastor, a student, or simply a lover of the Bible, this book helps you get more out of God's Word by revealing, in a deep and clear way, the real meaning from it that bring depth to your understanding of Scripture. In my opinion, Christian Theology is the most up-to-date and useful book of Systematic Theology we have available (Maybe, best them Grudem's work). It equips every seminary students or even laymen with the necessary skills to understand the conservative view of the Bible. That book has an exceptional value, it was written in a clear and precise way. Indispensable!"
4,Erickson's Christian Theology,"I have the hard copy, but this Kindle version is very practical for quick look ups. Very balanced and an excellent resource for your library. a must have, especially if you are studying Theology. I had it because of my classes at www.lru.edu"
4,Most Useful,"This book was purchased for a class that I am currently taking and it has been very enlighting. I have learned Erickson's thoughts on the nature of sin, the source of sin, the conceptions of Salvation and much more. This book will be use for my continued growth and knowledge regarding Christian Theology."
1,almost unreadable on a Kindle,I read three pages before deciding the Kindle version was illegible. It looks format wise as if no one edited it. I will buy it instead. Amazon charges a lot of money for this Kindle debacle.Sad really. I needed it for class. Buyer beware....book is overpriced and not formatted properly.
4,Good text made better by Kindle version,"Good text made better by Kindle version. Searchable, highlightable, etc. Wish all books were available in Kindle. No regrets at all."
3,A reference book,"As a researcher of digital publications say that ""The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing"" is a book that despite being older has great references in digital languages''."
2,"All hype, little substance!","Check out the illustration on the box --- it's two women. The title, ""Girlfriends"" also seems to indicate that this video has lots in the way of girl-girl encounters... but it DOESN'T! Only the first story involves ""girlfriends"", and that's a rather brief and underdeveloped story. I purchased this video, and wish I hadn't. 'Nuff said!"
2,very tame story lines with not enough erotica,"The reviewer below is right. The box art indicates girl-girl action, and the first story certainly leaned in that direction. But this was all PG-13 stuff, with the two women involved barely touching one another. And it was all downhill after that. This could easily have been a five-star production, as everything was there but never materialized. Who knows? Maybe the best scenes were all left on the cutting room floor.In the first scenario, that blonde girl looked a LOT like Gabriella from the Xena show, didn't she?"
2,Not worth the Money for what you get - too expensive,"Purchased this item for my girlfriend. Recieved it damaged. Returned it and revieved the second one damaged, waiting for parts. The vanity is cheaply made, but looks nice. The wood is not matched - half is light colored and the other side is dark. Somewhat difficult to assemble. This item is from a third party and if you have a problem you have to contact the company who shipped it, takes some time to get everything fixed - several weeks."
4,La Chanteuse pops out another hit,"Having been nominated at the French NRJ awards for this single I think she deserves the publicity. Though her style is its usual upbeat Popish self her musical lyricism has evolved somewhat. A little dissapointed that there are still repeats of her HIT jamais loin de toi, yes it was a hit about 6 years ago but its about time she came up with a new B side track.Hopefully this is it. This song has wonderful lyrics about how she empathises with her baby sister and its a rite of passage song. She talks about how she went through the same trials and tribulations growing up and that in the end everything will be ok. Still the same quality lyrics, but more matured. All together a good single if you like her previous stuff. For those who havent had much time getting to know her lyrics try her album perseverance. it has all her big songs, chanter pour ceux, enfants de l'an 2000, its worth the investment as an introduction to french pop in itself."
3,Stay With Me,"What's in a name? Entirely too much for Sarah Tremont. Stumbling across time lands her more than a century in the past, with a man who absalutely despises the woman whose name and face she bears. The more she hears about Sarah I, the more she has to agree; but Sarah II is the polar opposite, quickly endearing herself to everyone but her predecessor's brother-in-law, the man she is forced to share quarters with until she can find a way out, to another town, if not another time. Before she can do that, she needs to do what she is sure is her purpose in time traveling, healing John Beckett's inner scars; something she can only do by staying and loving him.*** A very sweet romance is built on an intriguing premise that may be a well used one, but is now done with a freshness that transcends that fact, affirming the miracle of love on every page. ***"
5,"An interesting documentary - a bit too expensive, though","I bought this on a friend's recommendation, and have just seen it. The comments from different people who are about to leave a job after many years, and comments from others who are active now in new ways after leaving jobs(some say that the word ""retirement"" is not in their vocabulary) - are interesting. I especially liked seeing Mort Walker, who draws the ""Beetle Bailey"" cartoons - he's 80, and still lively, active, and humorous. The only negative comment I'd have is the price tag for a one hour DVD. A bit high."
5,Inspiring to do the right thing,"I work for adult probation and I am a licensed chemical dependency counselor...this is one video that works in this environment, because they immediatley relate, and it scares them...even for a while, it might be long enough for them to ""stop and think""...I cannot say enough of this film. It has a way of grabbing you from the very start and does not let you go...Kudos to MADD for putting this film out there for us to use as a tool."
4,OK,"tragic and sad stories, but to the point and hopefully enough persuasion to make a difference in our young drivers; i think it's worth showing."
4,EX,"Excellent, very emotional, honest feelings from victims families and one driver who caused the hurt and pain."
4,"Good, in spite of the Christian evangelism!","This is a highly recommended DVD to show in a DUI program. While it does include a bit of mild Christian prosletizing, it does encompass the essential element of a DUI being a choice that CAN and DOES result in someone getting KILLED! The coverage of the impact of DUI on a family is excellently presented, and the ending scene of the DUI perpetrator asking for forgiveness is VERY powerful!"
5,D.U.I. Dead In Five Seconds,This was a documentary on impaired driving and the consequences of it from the perspective of the perpetrator and the victim's family. It was extremely well done and is invaluable in the work I do with alcoholics.
4,Different but Enjoyable,"This is a reissue of an album that came out thirty years ago. I have it in its original incarnation, and I find it quite enjoyable, if a bit eccentric -- or perhaps that eccentricity is part of its charm. We do get various takes on the tradition tune La Folia, but those renditions veer off sometimes into more abstract treatments are now and then accompanied by offbeat sounds or, as I hear it, snatches of other period works or even Turkey in the Straw. If you want various covers of La Folia done in perhaps a more historically accurate and reverent fashion, the two releases by Jordi Savall and friends should cover that need. In the meantime, this album is not to be sniffed at. Wandering at times, with yes a bit of a Renaissance Spike Jones flavor now and then, I still find it engaging and endearing."
1,Awful,"As a precaution, I replaced the original two front strut mounts when replacing the front cartridges in my 1997 Audi. Big mistake. They lasted less than 500 miles. The rubber seal broke completely in the passenger's side and half on the driver's side, under normal driving conditions (Or to put it in perspective, in exactly the same driving conditions as the originals were used, which lasted 35000 miles and were still in good shape). Do not buy this brand of struts. I'm now afraid that the cartridges (KYB as well) may end up being as bad as these struts."
5,My favorite flavor of this brand is Bangkok Curry!,"Absolutely delicious, light, gluten-free, low calorie, inexpensive lunch! I am on a perpetual diet, and nothing has made me happier than this soup. I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ. All of which is bad for me. Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. And I like the fact that they put two flavor packets, one is the soup mix and the other is the spicy oil, so if your kids don't like hot spicy, they don't have to add the spicy oil packet. Great, right?The price works out best if you get the box of 72 from Amazon. This package of 12 actually works out to be a little more expensive than the supermarket, but still worth it if your supermarket doesn't carry it."
3,Sixth Century,I was a bit surprised to learn that it is the 6th century. I guess since Sharon Kay Penman recommended it I just didn't investigate further about what part of history it contained. Did not read much of it.
3,Where's the Editor?,"Although an interresting twist on Arthurian legend, the Kindle edition contains many typographical errors and very frequent insertion of the author's name and book title in the oddest places. It also has many needlessly hyphonated words. A good read if one can get past these distractions."
2,No legend here,"If this author's story of Arthur was the base of the legend, then there would be no Arthurian legend. Her view of Arthur is of a weak. drunk. womanizer that would never lead anybody without the majestic Guinevere to prod and prop him."
2,None,This book is not on par to the first two in the trilogy. It amost feels as if a different author penned it....its ponderous and slow. The few interesting plot elements are glossed over for detailed description of the countrysde and scenery.
4,"Good food, layout a little sketchy","The recipes in this book are great (the kind I call ""real food"" recipes as opposed to ""cookbook recipes"") and will be ones that you'll make over and over and your whole family will love. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the layout of the book leaves something to be desired and I think it needs pictures. When it comes to preparation of a dish you've never made before, a visual image is just as important as a recipe."
1,Waste of Money,I don't like RR's cookbooks. The recipes are not nearly as good or complete as they are on her show. I suggest watching her show and printing the recipes from Foodnetwork's website.
3,rachael ray comfort foods,"I've tried several recipes from this book. The best recipe is only so-so. I'll go through the recipes I've tried.The chicken soup was bitter and salty. I couldn't feed it to my chldren. The turkey corn chili needed a ot of salt and cheese to save it and was too crunchy.The chili mac was good but needed less pasta in the dish.The smothered beef steaks were good but the sauce was too watery. Either reduce more or add cornstarch.The crab cakes and the red pepper sauce to go with them were horrendous. They were like bland gummy balls in a bitter sauce.I haven't tried any more because frankly, I'm afraid. I don't like wasting my time or food for that matter."
4,One of her best books,"This book was written before Rachael Ray was in everyone's living rooms at least twice a day and it has the best recipes out of any of her books. Her clam chowder recipe in this book is amazing and it's ""real"" clam chowder, not like her quick and easy cookie cutter recipes she makes on her daytime talk show."
4,Looks good,"Haven't used it yet; no free tie. But its Rachel, so it should be good, easy and quick to make."
1,No Pictures!,"I loved RR on the Food Network, I love her new TV show and I love her 30-min meals but her cookbooks are a major disappointment. I'm motivated (big-time) by photos of how the finished recipe will look and this cookbook has NO photos beyond the one on the cover. Boring. No more RR cookbooks for me."
5,Danny Pine and Patty Plum tree,"This is a delightful childrens' book.It is the story of two trees,Danny,a wise old pine,and Patty,the latest newcomer to the forest.Through Danny's wise counsel ,and the situations she encounters,Patty learns many things in the ""school of life"". This book teaches the effect of thoughts and attitudes on our lives and does so without ""preaching"".It is profoundly spiritual,but not religious.There is no mention of religious or sectarian doctrine.This is a ""plus"" to me. The wonderful color illustrations bring the story alive.I would recommend this book for children 2-12,and it would even benefit us grown-up kids too.There is not one of us who couldn't profit from reading and applying this book."
4,Raspberry chipotle vinaigrette,"One of the fastfood sandwich chains has a raspberry chipotle salad dressing that's pretty good, so I went looking for something similar. This product got lots of rave reviews on the Internet, so I thought that I'd take a chance.The verdict? I'm glad I took a chance. This dressing, which is low in fat but high in flavor, is an absolute winner. I even keep a bottle at the office for those eat-at-my-desk lunches. The combination of sweet and bold is outstanding."
5,The best Vinaigrette I've ever had in my life!,"This is the stuff salads were made for! So yummy. I put lots of goodies in my salad - chicken, walnuts, green onions, tomatoes and on and on, and then top it with this, and it's a salad made in heaven! The ONLY down side to this vinaigrette is that it's pricey, but oh sooo good and so worth it. I eat a lot of salads and so I can't use it each time I make one, but for those special salads and for company, this is what comes out! A perfect balance of sweet raspberries and balsamic vinegar, it's a home run! Would be a perfect item for a gift basket as well!"
1,More noise than air,"The good news is that this fan is really not that noisy; however, the bad news is that this fan hardly stirs the air. I bought this fan thinking I was buying one I had bought a few years back, but when I first used the fan, I realized that this is a different brand. Don't waste your money. I also bought this fan because I wanted to wall mount it, but it does not come with wall-mounting hardware. I'm disappointed."
3,"Nice fan, but too quiet.","I specifically bought this fan for white noise and was hoping it would be loud as others have claimed it is. I was disappointed. It's a nice little fan, but not nearly loud enough. I will keep it though, and just use it during the summer for cooling only."
2,This isn't just white noise...,"I was really excited about ordering this fan after reading reviews. I wanted some heavy 'white noise' for sleeping... however, this thing is LOUD. It also has a consistent loud rotating noise that happens about every second (slower than the blade rotation) and it sounds like it is on its last leg. It is irritating to listen to as I am trying to fall asleep and has actually hindered my sleeping rather than improving it."
1,this fan blows..,"This fan is very loud and hardly moves any air around. If you're looking for a fan to pin point an airstream, i'm talking like a 4"" stream of air, then this unit will work for you. And you can only feel the air from about 2 feet away. no further. This fan is crap!This fan produces more sound than air. Has very little mobility, you can move the fan about 45 degrees in one direction. That's it.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FAN TO ANYONE. ANYONE. This unit is a P.O.S.I give it a single star because it works and arrived quickly."
2,Not loud enough for white noise use,"When our previous fan stopped working, I ordered this one based on reviews of people using it for white noise while sleeping. We use a fan for white noise and also to drown out the noise of my snoring so my girlfriend can sleep! This fan just isn't loud enough for that, kinda disappointing, but good I guess if you're looking for a quieter fan.I ended up downloading a white noise app for my iphone and we use that now at night which has worked great."
2,Noisy and has weak output,"I've had this fan for a couple of years at work to cool me down after biking in or whatever. When I turn it on, people come by and say, what's that noise? But in terms of flow rate of air, it is lacking. The motor is cranking, and the fan blades are making a ton of noise, but the output is pretty weak. I blame poor design of the fan blades. They must not be true airfoils (like a propeller) hence the low output. I am going to seek out a new fan that is stronger and possibly quieter. Not sure if I will find it though."
5,You can get anything in or out of Season at Amazon!,"If you need a Fan, and it doesn't happen to be in you local store because its late fall.............Trust Amazon to have it, ship it and no hassles later, you have your air ""warm"" circulating nicely."
3,"okay fan, doesn't make a lot of sound","I bought this fan to mask the birds chirping in the morning, in hopes my children would sleep longer. Unfortunately, this is not a very loud fan. I was hoping since it was named 'blizzard' it would be loud - not much luck. However, it is a good/decent fan overall if you are just looking for a compact fan."
1,Not happy,"Way too loud even as a white noise fan, and the return policy is TERRIBLE. I spent $ 24.33 total and in order to return it I had to pay up $8.00 and in the end only received $ 15.00 back. This company sucks!"
3,Not loud enough for white noise,"I bought this fan based on reviews that it was too noisy, because I wanted enough white noise for sleeping. This fan was too quiet to drown out any road sounds I can hear from my bedroom. I decided to keep it anyway to put in my guestroom, because it works well as a cooling fan."
1,Loudest fan EVER,The box appeared to be re sealed. Which tells me it was a return!!This is the LOUDEST Fan ever!!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WASTE OF MONEY. ONLY reason I am keeping it is because of shipping cost for returns!
3,I bought because it was Loud but...,"I bought this as a white noise maker in my toddler's room. Even after purchasing it because others said it was noisy, it's actually too noisy, even for a noise machine. Virtually no difference in sound between medium and high setting. Both sound like a plane taking off. If it had a low setting, it might be okay for a white noise machine for a baby or kids room."
2,"Too Small, too weak",Purchased for a small college dorm room for my daughter. It's for personal use since her roommate has her own fan. Pretty disappointed. This fan is much smaller than the photo and measurements lead you to believe. Not sure where they took the measurements from. Even more disappointing is the amount of air(or lack thereof) this thing moves. You have to be less than about three feet away to even notice any airflow. Pretty weak effort by the manufacturer. Probably deserves one star but at least it came in one piece and actually works.
2,WEEK AIR FLOW !!!,Fan has average air flow at best my old fan was much stronger. Not a very good product in my opinion.
4,It blows the smokes.,I use it to blow away the cooking smells/smokes since my NYC apartment's kitchen has no other means of venting. No real complaints given the price.
4,A little too loud,"I bought this fan to replace an older model. It works fantastic, but the motor is a lot louder than my old one and can get annoying sometimes."
2,"OK, but LOUD.","I now know why people buy oscillating fans. The inability to put it on oscillating mode is more annoying than I had anticipated. So I advise you to think twice. But that's my big problem with the fan. Presumably, if you buy this fan, that is not a problem for you, so I am not reducing stars for that reason.The problem is the fan is LOUD. For the noise it makes, it should be able to bring a small plane to liftoff speed... Or at least move a ton more air than it does. The airflow is not very impressive - not more than average for a fan of its size. But the noise is extremely distracting."
3,Strong for a little fan,"Strong little fan, stronger than a full sized box fan I bought at Sears last year. Has holes in the base so it can be hung on a wall or window sill. Only downside is it is VERY loud. If you are listening to music or watching TV it has to be turned way up to hear anything while this is on."
2,LOUD,"This thing is so loud as other reviewers have noted. Yes, it blows air, but I would not recommend it for areas where you value any kind of quiet."
4,not a powerhouse,"It's a small personal fan. It's not going to cool a room, but if you want a little breeze at your desk or on your head while you sleep or that kind of thing, it works fine. Range is probably about 10-12 feet. Construction is uninspiring but adequate. I find the whir of it pleasant - it sounds like a fan to me - ymmv."
2,Not much air at all,"This is an OK fan for personal use (as indicated in the description), but I was disappointed that I could barely feel any air coming out of it from 3.5 feet away."
2,Too loud,"I bought this for the white noise and, as other reviewers indicated, it is way too loud. Even on low. I returned it."
5,very cute,"My 2 year old really likes them. he has the others as well (alligator, hippo, panda) and the ark and zoo, so they all ""play together"". His favorite from this group is the ""cheeto""."
4,fun new animals,"These animals came with our Noah's Ark set. Not only are they fun to play with in the set, but my 19 month old daughter learned three new animal names. She recognizes and can say ""leopard, rhino"" and ""peacock"" (hence the 5 stars for educational value). She has so much fun playing with her Noah's Ark set and these animals!"
4,Fun way to do a not-so-fun job,"I usually use my ipod when I'm on the move, so it was a big hassle untangling the headphone cords. The tetran makes it really easy to remember to keep the cords organized. If I need to break out the headphones in a hurry, it's very easy to plug in the end and ""yo-yo"" the tetran for quick deployment (and a little fun). You get some strange looks at first, but it is totally worth getting to save time and energy."
2,Poor Ink Quality,"The layout is nice and the pictures are beautiful, but I sincerely wish they'd used a different type of ink for the pictures. It rubs off onto the connecting pages causing a ""carbon copy"" effect. Anything you write on one page of the calendar will show up on the next few if there's a picture between. This even using a gel or felt tip pen with minimal pressure. After two weeks of using it, I'm about ready to give up and get something else."
3,"unique photos, but better planners out there","I bought this planner because I usually get Sierra Club or Audobon and thought that Lonely Planet would also include cool pictures and be something a little different. I wasn't disappointed in that respect, but I'm giving it only three stars, because when I write in it (even lightly with pencil) my writing gets imprinted onto other pages probably with the ink from the pictures, so its a mess. And since its advertised as a 'diary' as well, that especially shouldn't fly. I have to treat it a bit gingerly, and that doesn't really mesh with my lifestyle."
1,disapointed,i bought it for a play i bought 5 the mislead you thinking the skirt comes with it and the straps arent even sewed on its just a big piece of fabric
