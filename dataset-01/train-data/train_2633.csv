4,Nikon case,Great little camera case. Has a main pocket for the camera and a second smaller pocket to hold batteries and memory stick. It's well made ballistic nylon- very durable. Attaches to belt or sholder strap.
4,Something missing,"The case is great, but as someone else mentioned there is no strap. That is big draw back when carrying the camera."
5,Great CD,"I enjoy listening to Midtown Underground, after hearing them play live a few times I was very happy when I herd that they had come out with there own CD. There music is unique and they make it completely there own. Seeing them live is a real treat as well because every preformance is different they are never the same when preforming theres always a little somthing diffrent that keeps you waiting to see what they'll do next.If you like Jazz or if you just like music I would highly reccomend getting your hands on a copy of there CD as soon as possible."
4,Exhaustively researched and chilling in its implications,"If this doesn't convince you that massive corporations can destroy nation-states at their leisure, then nothing will."
2,A poor design and other issues,"I bought a pair of the Nikon Action 7-15x35 Zoom Binoculars from Amazon recently and was disappointed about various items. The binoculars were poorly packaged without almost any protection in a very shallow box. Then I found they were misaligned. No matter what I did I could not get them to focus properly. The Zoom feature made everything worse as I could not focus them at all on the x15 setting. The Zoom's quality also seem a bit low quality. Also, the lenses had finderprints right out of the box which seemed to have been squashed a little bit.The above was disapponting because I had previously ordered (not from Amazon) a pair of Nikon Action 7x35 Non-Zoom binoculars and the optics were just great. It leads me to believe that either the Zoom binoculars have a poor design altogether or that I received a defective item that was a return and previously used or both."
3,Nikon?,"I purchased this item as ""open box"" and in fact the box was in very shabby condition. The binoculars seemed ""like new"" as promised, and I have found them to be essentially of good quality. The only issue I have with them is that there is no indication either on the binoculars, or on the packaging to suggest that they are made by Nikon. The pair I got was from a third party vendor and they were considerably less expensive than any of the others, but I assumed that to be a result of their open box status, not because they were a Chinese copy of the Nikon product. That said, I'm happy with them. They were a bargain at the price I paid, which was under $25."
4,Nikon 7-15x35 Zoom Binocular,"This binocular is quite easy to use and has a nice clear field of view. I find it very useful for bird watching, for example. Two negatives: (1) it is bulkier than the small fixed power types (2) the range of focus goes well past infinity and the useful range of focus (close up to infinity) is all in about half the total focus control range. This takes a bit of getting used to."
5,Wonderful,"I bought this same clock 20 years ago. It's malfunctioned because a can of pop fell on it. So I ordered a new one. The original one is now working again - who knows why. Anyways, the new clock is in our extra bedroom and both are working perfectly. It;'s not expensive, and it works for years. Highly recommended,."
3,for the history buff,"This work by Andrew Gih (Ji) can now be viewed as little more than a curio. Gih was one of the leading indigenous pastors to emerge from Republican China and as part of the Bethel Evangelistic Band had some of the more storied histories of any Christian leader in China. This book in particular is a collection of his thoughts on the state of the world during the early years of the Cold War and how Christians should be preparing for the possible outcomes of global tensions. While the content of the book has little contemporary relevance, it does provide an intriguing look into both the life and thought of a fascinating individual who was so central to the emergence of a truly indigenous Chinese church during the first half of the twentieth century."
5,Outstanding quality,This has allowed me to use my camera virtually anywhere.Buttons and controls work like they should........ A+
4,Great buy from Amazon,"The Sony SPK-SA Sport Pack was a great buy from Amazon for about $30.00. I previously looked at this same item on Sony's site and it was $99.00 plus shipping. However, I have not to date used the product either in the rain or underwater hence I felt I could only give it a 4 out 5 stars. In fact my plans are to use the sports Pack for my DSC-S60 model camera when I go out fishing(saltwater environment) or to take pictures when necessary in the rain not under water. The case itself fits the camera like a glove and all controls work as per normal. How well the sports pack seals work under water is anyone's guess and someone will have to bet their camera that they are good enough to hold.Paul Porter"
5,Works good under water,I decided to buy this sports pack to use for snorkeling and it worked awesome. I was in the water for approx. 25min and took about 50 pictures and they turned out awesome. I would definitely recommend this to others who want to use there sony digital camera for snorkeling. Also it was alot cheaper here then ebay or any other stores. Shipping was fast and I would definitely buy from amazon.com again.
3,NOT FOR WEATHER EXPOSURE,"While the amazon description says you can enjoy the outdoors with these bulbs, they are not rated for weather exposure. Says so right on the bulb base.However, I've used similar bulbs before on a covered porch and carport in Florida fog and humidity with no problems. But you might think twice before putting them in a fixture that is out in the rain."
3,"A lot of light for yellow, still lots of bugs!","I've never had any of these yellow bulbs before, but this bulb gives out a lot of light, but we still have a few moths fly in every evening when we let our dogs out. Maybe they are not affected by these. We got a great deal on them so no real worries, but they aren't stopping bugs at our house."
1,Amazon needs to check its inventory as you only get one bulb not 4,I returned and got replacements 2 times and there seems to be the wrong items in the bins they are picking from. The description says 4 pack but I kept getting only one bulb. This happened twice so something is clearly wrong. I hope they fix it because 17.99 for one bulb is wrong.
2,"Less bugs than with a regular light, but still LOTS of bugs!","I'm sure this will last long, and while I do have less bugs than a normal light, this really didn't help all that much. Oh well, good thing they were cheap!"
2,Another re-recording,"WARNING - not indicated in the listing by Amazon - ""NEW STEREO RECORDING BY ORIGINAL ARTIST"" from the front of the cd. When, oh when, will a reseller indicate that this is not the original recording, but a different recording. I am not opposed to remastering of an original tape recording, but to not indicate that a CD is a new recording....?"
4,Good product for most uses,"After the first room and the learning process, I was able to get the roller part of the painting done it each room in about 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the room. If you changed the colors a lot I would not use this product, it took 15 to 20 minutes to clean the thing. I used two different kinds of rollers depending on the application of the paint. Keep in mind all painting machines are only as good as the paint you use."
1,SLOWER than if just using rollers!,"I never could get a good paint flow despite trying every ""troubleshooting"" tip. Even called Wagner for help. After an hour of struggling with setup and ""fixes,"" decided to use it despite the uneven paint flow. Took just as long (or longer) than with a roller.At the end, clean up was even more ridiculous. Decided to call it a day and threw the entire unit away. Will never buy another Wagner product."
1,"Good idea, bad implementation","Worked fine to paint 1 room.Stopped pumping paint then after. I took it apart and found that the driving rod between the reduction gear and pumping rollers is made of plastic and has snapped.Timing was bad, wasted a couple hours attempting to fix it, gave up.Puzzled with why wouldn't they spend extra $1 on metal part where all the pressure concentrates.Not reliable."
4,kurt russell as elvis,i bought these for my mom and they is one of her favorites and kurt russell does a outstanding job as elvis-i would recommend these movie to elvis fans everywhere
5,Kurt Russell IS Elvis,"I remember seeing this movie when it aired on tv and thought it and especially Kurt Russell were absolutely fabulous! I've always known that he was an excellent actor but Kurt Russell's portrayal of Elvis was unbelievable! Kurt catches every movement, his speaking voice, those famous Elvis hip movements which drove teen girls wild in the 50's. Kurt Russell IS Elvis Presley! An excellent supporting cast, including his own father, Bing Russell, and Oscar winner, Shelley Winters, and the actress who became Mrs. Kurt Russell, Season Hubley, beautifully portrays Priscilla Presley. ""Elvis"" is a wonderful movie. The singer who dubs Elvis' voice is so good you feel like Elvis is really singing. Kurt Russell really got gypped out of an Emmy award for this role. He is the best. Always gorgeous too. How lucky Goldie Hawn is for all these years they've been together!!! ""Elvis"" should be part of every movie lovers' collection. It's GREAT!!!"
5,Kurt's Elvis...,One of the Best tv movies ever made of an Icon! Kurt pulls his moves off with incredible precision! Even the lip sinking was good for this film back in the 70's. Shelly Winters nails mama Presley. I remember seeing this when it came out when I was 11 or 12 and thinking how cool it was then. Still cool at my young 43.
5,One of the first Elvis bio movies made,"I'm really not sure if it's the first Elvis bio movie ever made but it's one of the first. This was filmed in 1979 just a couple of years after Elvis passed. It was produced by Dick Clark Enterprises, directed by John Carpenter and was a approved at the time by the Presley Estate. There are some in-accuracies in the movie but you get the over all idea of how Elvis career went up until his come back to live shows int he 70's. Kurt Russell does one of the best depictions of Elvis. Kurt had the opportunity of working with Elvis when he was a kid in ""It Happened At The World's Fair""."
4,"There's no subs, Mama!","After last year's scuttled release, I'm happy to finally see this on DVD. I just wished they'd added English subtitles or closed captions."
3,not great quality,I ordered this online b/c my mom wanted it.She loves the movie but the pic quality wasn't the best.
3,Sugar coated Elvis,"While Kurt Russells performance is great in this movie, its takes events that happened to Elvis and sugar coats them. The drugs, women and even violence ( Like the pool cue incident ) are left out to give us the Elvis we knew before his death. We get the shy humble country boy here. The most frustrating line of the movie is where Elvis finally blows his top but says ""whats happening to me"". Ronnie Mcdowell is ok as the signing voice of Elvis but anyone who knows Elvis voice will immediatly recognize its not Elvis. I do really like the Movie. I just wish Elvis really was like this."
3,Kurt Russell - Evis movie,"While I believe this is a good movie, buying the dvd is not in my plans, if I want to watchc the movie I can from my video which is in my library. Kurt makes the best impersonation ever done of Elvis, but I do believe that because the movie was done too soon after the passing of the King, is missing a lot of important things, but remember EP Enterprises will still do anything possible to erase the last years of the King as if they never existed, but we fans know how human he was and we still care for the man.A good and real movie about Elvis Presley is still never done and I wonder if there will ever be a real and good one, made from the heart and with the real facts and the best actors.Ida Ritter"
1,Annoying,"I had very high hopes for this film. I had heard only good things about it. However, upon watching the DVD, I just found it plain boring. It comes across to me as a low budget, B-movie. None of the performances are convincing, and the script spends way too much time on his Mama. The whole production design is just off. They have Elvis looking like a freak the way he dresses in the high school. Nobody in their right mind would intentionally dress that different from his classmates. And his ridiculous pompadour hairstyle is ALWAYS perfectly combed in every scene, no matter what he may be doing. No one is that hung up on his hair. Bottom line: this movie does not portray the life of Elvis Presley accurately. If you're truly interested in learning about the real Elvis, please read ""Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley"" by Peter Guralnick (Back Bay Books, 1995)."
5,Elvis The Movie,"I have seen a lot of movies about the life of Elvis Presley, but this movie is the very best. The cast is great, and the actor ( Kurt Russell ) played in one of Elvis' movies as a child,( It Happened At The Worlds Fair ),and after he grew up, he played the electrifying part of Elvis Presley. All the songs in the movie were performed by Ronnie Mcdowell, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who loved Elvis.... Even the non Elvis fan will enjoy it."
3,Something missing...,"I was waiting for this moment !! Finally ""John Carpenter's Elvis"" is mine ! Amazing copy, very good sound, captions etc... But 2 points are missing: no John Carpenter commentary (really a shame) and, worst thing of all, the song ""burning love"" (the last performance before closing credits) is missing !! I wasn't sure of it since i checked my old tv version copy and the vestron theatrical vhs. The song is not on the dvd... Can somebody explain that ??"
5,elvis,"The movie is just what I was hopeing for. It's a very well wrighten and Kirk Russell was grate as Elvis .Dick Clark got elvis down pate,the songs were just grate."
1,oh!What a lousy book!,"Seems that all these so called Indian writers who choose to go west look for a formula to cause sensation. And incest is the big word for them. But I guess getting an audience and advance thru shock treatment is what is in their mind and not good stories. This book is the pits. I found it sheer bad and irritating, though not as bad as Raj kamal jha. Sure there are some images of India which make sense if you come here as a tourist. So is a guilt and hangup of sex. Sharma should immediately quit writing, it'll be good for all of us. There is no other way of summing up my feelngs."
1,speaking as mr. akhil sharma's cousin...,"he has yet to send me a free copy of his novel, and i'll tell you I sure as hell ain't going to pay for it. hmmph. anyway, even though i haven't read the book, it would appear that he is not making any hindus happy.... Cheerio!"
3,Intriguing but unpleasant read,"I read this book 3 years ago and didn't enjoy it at all, which may be why it has stuck with me. I felt the daughter was a bitter woman who allowed the abuse to completely rule her life to the point that she was perpetually angry and couldn't find a smidge of enjoyment in anything. The father was despicable in his corruptness, his abuse and his weakness, a truly pathetic man, who you might feel sorry for except that he constantly whines about everything and does quite a good job of feeling sorry for himself. Anyway, I gave this book 3 stars because I really did not like any of the characters, and of course, some of the subject matter is obviously disturbing. However, I think the main characters are very well developed, which is one of the two most important elements for me in a good story (the other being a good plot, which I didn't really find in this book)."
3,Unpleasant reality,"No heroes, no adventure, just the dreary cruel story of a weak corrupt and pathetic man and the harm he inflicts. The corruption of the protagonist is set against a background of chaos and corruption in India as a whole. This does not make for pleasant or uplifting reading but the author should be commended for well written, uncompromising realism."
1,"Dark, depressing, and forced","Incest is a big part of this book. Mostly because the author seems to want to shock the reader, and once in place, incest is used to justify a bizarre -- and stupid -- series of events that just spiral completely out of control.The characters are not logical, the plot line jerks from location to location for no real reason.Complete waste of time. Read anything else -- anything."
1,poor storytelling,"Do not get mislead by this book. This is just atrociously bad storytelling; poor fiction disguised as depiction of reality. As an Indian who has travelled a bit around the country and the globe, I can make make out that Akhil Sharma's game is to become a part of the big Indian wirters making waves these days. But since his talenbt is so limited, he ends up serving very flat,boring fare, designed to shock you, but only managing to irritate in the end. First of all the character. All plastic and unhappy. The lead characters are so mean and negative, one wonders why the book has been written. The story line is a yawn. The pretense of greater literary merit is a laugh. I give it zero star rating. Just run away from this sad, bad book..."
1,A pathetic book with weak charecters,"I bought this book with great expectations but it is a big failure. Mr Sharma should not foray into writing and should do better research before writting a book.This is a disgusting book, not worth reading"
1,generic,"purchased this item to extend the life of my wife's ipaq 6315. as soon as the battery is 'installed' and plugged in, it begins charging and the device automatically wants to start up. the battery is generic and the 6315 immediately detects this and refuses to function with the battery. a more specific message is the installation of an un-authorized battery has been detected and will be disabled. don't buy this item"
3,"Ok, but could be better....","At the time of this writing there were 4 reviews - one person mentioned the bulbs looked more orange, and another spoke about the bulb burning out very quickly. I have expierenced both of those problems.One of the first things I noticed when I took the bulbs out of the package was that one of them had a slight orange coating compared to the rest - sure enough, two bulbs give off a red glow while one is more orange when lit. Another issue is that one of the red bulbs has already burnt out after only 2 days of use. I was a bit surprised at the dead bulb because Globe Enersaver boasts that this product should be good for 8,000 - 10,000 hours and are ""warranted to last 5 years"" with a replacement guarentee - I just might take them up on that replacement guarentee."
3,"Lights are fine, but they give off an orange light, not red","I was hoping for a nice, dark, red hue to come from these lights. Instead I get an orange color I'm not that fond of. :("
3,Two for the price of three,"Prompt delivery, the verdict is out on the price because one of the three only lasted for a couple of hours before it was burnt out , I purchased these bulbs specificly to use during the Christmas season only two survived the first season in use an average of 6 hours a day for approximately 20 days. I hope to find a replacement for the burnt out bulb at the local homestore at a good price, I chose not to go through the hassle of returning only one bulb. My original order consisted of 6 red bulbs and 6 green bulbs, 11 bulbs made it through the 1st season, I guess the odds could be worst but at the same time I think its realistic to expect all 12 to last at least the first season."
5,A Refreshing Female Perspective Of Life In The Wild West,"This book is a gem and would have to be one of my favourite collection of short stories set in the bygone days of the Old Wild West. In a genre largely dominated by men Ms. Coleman has bravely and successfully written a book full of real, believable characters and situations.It is interesting to note that many male writers in this field have great difficulty in creating believable female characters. Not so with Ms. Coleman.Read this book if you want to hear about life in the Old West from a woman's point of view. Well done Ms. Coleman!!!"
3,"nice boots, confusing sizes","I bought these for my twins, and I could never get an accurate sizing chart from the seller. I took a chance and mistakenly bought the size K6, thinking it meant ""kids 6 (for six-year olds)"". They were too small. it would really help to have accurate sizing charts indicating actual inches or ages."
1,He was so excited but three weeks later they were falling apart!,Cute boots but shoddy. They didn't even last a full month and he didn't wear them every day! For 27.00 I expected them to last until he outgrew them!
4,Kirdorable replaced my son's boots,"My son's boots also fell apart, but Kidorable replaced them. I paid for shipping and an $8 fee, but the company was very nice about it. I would buy another pair from them. My son loves them."
1,Perhaps the most unnecessary product ever.,"The only thing that you would need an SD card for when using the Wii is for custom soundtracks (works only in Excite Truck), photos (only viewable in the Photo Viewer), and game saves (which can be saved on a card anyway).You can't put Virtual Console games on it, so getting a 1GB or even a 2GB is overkill unless you've got a ton of music you want to listen to while playing Excite Truck.What's worse is that these cards are made by Sandisk and are exactly the same as the ones you can get for $15-$25 without the Wii name on it.So not only is the product mostly unnecessary, it's also incredibly overpriced. Avoid."
1,you'll want an sd if...,"ok so this praticular sd is basically useless( unless you plan on sending your wii to nintendo to be fixed with a generic sd card still in it[voided warranty with generic stuff]) however you NEED an SD card for 1 incredibly important reason...wiisave dot com!!!!!!!!Almost every game 100% completed for you to download and enjoy the multi player fun of everything unlocked. Multi player mode in excite, rampage, super swing, woods, ssx and more have become tons more fun without hundreds of gaming hours put in. And you NEED an sd card to download this stuff.Don't get this, but get a sd card for sure, amazon's got them cheap. $10 1gig"
1,TERRIBLE,So i bought these markers thinking they would make my board look really cool..... The only marker that actually worked for me was the pink one. And on top of that about 2 weeks after i put it on my board i was trying to erase it and it took 20 minutes and it stained the board. Do not buy these unless you dont care about runing your board.
2,IT'S NOT A CAPE/SHAWL...,"This thing is clearly a poncho only! I like the color but the thing sheds like crazy!I removed the silly looking collar, hemmed the neckline, turned the poncho sideways and it looks classy over a dress or pants outfit. IT'S NOT A CAPE OR A SHAWL!"
5,Quick and Easy Murals,A great book for those who want to start painting on the walls. While if doesn't show a beginner color worksheets on every element it is great for the intermediate to advanced beginner. There are hundreds of step-by-step photos. The projects that take the most painting skill are the borders. Donna shows you how to paint six wall borders using photos showing step by steps. The four wall murals give a great effect and are truly quick and easy. And then she shows two wall treatments that will show you that you never need to use wall paper again. It is so much easier to repaint than to strip wallpaper. For the more advanced or highly motivated painter Donna has included a section on starting you own Mural business. This book shows you can be a do it yourself muralist.
4,unique method,Very well written and demonstrated. Lots of different projects make the book pretty well rounded and a value
5,Lovely presentation,Donna has so many tutorial books on the market and this one is presented to the same high standard.Not overly high in techniques but if used in conjunction with others in the series will offer a range of ideas for that bare wall.Good quality matt gloss presentation.
4,A Tapestry of Hope (Lights of Lowell Series #1),I thought A Tapestry of Hope was a very good read. I do enjoy reading about the life in the South in the early years. I don't like giving anything away so I'll just say it was very difficult putting this book down. The author kept you interested in all the characters. I can't imagine how horrible it was being a slave or servitude person. I also can't imagine living the life of the rich and being so innocent as Jasmine and thinking all lived happy healthy lives at The Willows.I'm going to be looking for other books in this series.
5,Love Tracie Peterson!,I am currently reading through all of Tracie Peterson's books. I absolutely love her characters and enjoy the series that she creates. This has been one of my favorites as it ties to another series Bells of Lowell. You will jot be disappointed in these books!
1,Sooo Disappointed,"*Spoiler Alert* I have really enjoyed both of these authors in the past but was horribly disappointed by this book. There is no romance in this book at all. I really enjoyed learning about the history of the textile/cotton industry and the plight of the Irish and slaves. But I expect some happy or enjoyable moments in a romance book and there were none. I especially had trouble with the fact that her husband was molesting the servant girl. I liked the way the main character ""Jasmine"" grew spiritually but I had almost no connection with her, we didn't get inside her head much. After reading the other reviews I'm glad I didn't buy the 3 book series."
4,Tapestry of Hope,Great read! I have started on the second in the series and am just as pleased with it as the first. I can't wait to read number three.I found the book to be full of different background characters of interest. It often made me mad at Bradley and Malcolm. I find having to wed someone for the betterment of a father's business and not love is horrifying. But some good comes out of even a bad situation.
4,Interesting view,"The book is easy to read, also for non English.It gives an interesting view on how a woman can experience Asia and especially India.It hold my attention right from the start and I couldnt stop reading till the end.I think its a need to read for everybody who wants to travel to Asia and especially to India.I think the writer LOVES and HATES India at the same time.But no matter love or hate prevailes, India has changed her view on life forever."
4,a nice read........enjoy,I read this book in one weekend. I have never back-packed before but have always been interested in the people who have the courage to take off and do it for reasons good or bad. The book gave me a good insight into the mentality of these travelers...their adventures...the dangers and the highs. I believe Anne-Marie Pop has captured all of these elements in her book. It is a young girl's story and a story told very well. Enjoy !!!
4,A Brief Look into the Life of a Backpacker,"Feeling unaccountably miserable living the life of a successful Westerner, Anna decides to leave it all behind to backpack around Asia. This book is comprised of many very short chapters, more like a series if memories than a cohesive narrative, and told in the blunt style of a personal diary. As someone who has never seen any of the places Anna visits, I would prefered a lot more detail and description, but I still learned a lot about the life of the solo backpacker."
5,This screwdriver is a champ!,"I put this screwdriver to the test a time or two. It's been dropped, stepped on and ran over yet it's still going strong! I've always needed a durable driver and now I found it!"
5,A must read for every Gay Couple.,"I've been with my lover for four years and we both read this book. It was the catalyst for alot of important conversations that have had a profound/positive impact on our lives. This book is not preachy, it's well written and informative without being pushy. Thank you Eric Marcus, I owe you one."
3,Not Inspiring,"I read this after Kantor's ""My Guy"" - quite a contrast. This book is much less interesting, not quite as positive and outgoing, more a good housekeeping guide than an invitation to date ......I did not find this book well-written, and certainly not as interesting to read as Kantor's which I found quite exhilirating. Yes, I am disappointed......doesn't mean it is not a good book, just that the order in which I read them made it seem dull and uninspired."
2,Eh. There are better books on this subject.,Sort of vague on most subjects. A lot of interviews but somehow not a lot of insight into the actual mechanics of a successful relationship. I actually had to skip some sections because I felt it had little or nothing to do with me and my relationship issues. Seems more like a guide for someone who has never had a relationship in their life.Eh.
5,A Terrific Resource,This a really terrific explanation of the history of our modern adversarial system and would be particularly useful to trial lawyers who work within the adversarial criminal system. (It's one thing to know that one CAN object to hearsay...but haven't you ever wondered how that particular rule evolved?)
3,useful in parts,"Whole chapters of this book are frankly boring. Moreover, the cost is somewhat high.On the other hand, those sections dealing with Old Bailey procedure I found invaluable."
3,brass thermometer,"I love the thermometer; however, the top section of brass seems pitted or discolored. Am I supposed to touch it up with a brass cleaner? Was this product a USED or RETURNED item or a brand new one?"
2,Not up to Eureka quality standards...,"I have three Eureka tents and am a big fan...the main reason I felt comfortable buying this screen house. If you have a Eureka tent you know the ""pole connector hub"" is actually a METAL star that all the poles lock into. The screen house is a similar design, but the ""pole connector hub"" is cheap plastic! The first time I put this together I cracked the plastic star because everything was not perfectly aligned. It makes no sense that metal poles would be well supported by a plastic hub!It simply is not up to the level of quality I have expected from Eureka--even at this price I would stay away from this product."
1,No more Eureka!,"Although the tent appears to be adequate for day use, it is a terrible design and has absolutely no warranty backing from Eureka. All four metal poles clip into a center plastic holder/stabilizer at the top of the tent. In a brisk wind (nothing special, the tent poles rotated in the stabilizer and mangled it. To add to the difficulty, there were no guy wires to shore up the poles (not even places to attach ropes to the tent. So of course the tent is going to fail in any wind. When I called the manufacturer, I was told that wind is an act of god and not covered by the warranty! Imagine, the first time I use the tent, it fails and they have the nerve to tell me it is not covered! What warranty? Not a particularly strong wind by camping standards.To add insult to injury, it is not easy to tie back the screen for easy access.All in all a terrible design which is not backed by the manufacturer."
4,Good screenhouse for dirt surfaces only,I bought this screenhouse so my kids could play outside in a sandbox or with a water table without having to bother with bug spray or lots of sunscreen. From the photo I thought it would be okay for a deck; it needs to be in the dirt. It has a lot of room and was pretty easy to put up. I wish it had feet stabilizers so it could be placed in a patio or deck setting. Good quality though.
3,For Regular Users...,"I am planning this wedding full-time. I am always web-surfing for ideas. The budget and especially the price range is helpful but it's really nothing I haven't found on the web for free. The ideas in the book are dated (rose petal toss and no websites offered). As a planner for busy people who are very budget-oriented, it's not too bad. I am returning the book."
2,Pretty pictures.....thats about it,"Theres some good info here, however its all just (stuff) the authors stole from other writers. This book just has pretty pictures. Most of which i'm pretty sure were taken at the National Bison Range in western montana. That just happens to be where i spent 3 months this summer studying pronghorn with John Byers (look him up...he's in this book, and they misspelled his name at least once.). Good book for the average person that doesn't want to know specifics about pronghorn....bad book if you want more out of it than just ""oh, they aren't antelope?""Oh, and the title is dumb.....read and you'll understand why."
4,Holy St. Bernadette,This is a very sweet representation of St. Bernadette and her young life. I would think it is very historically correct and depicts her young life and seeing the Blessed Virgin Mary. Her life was not easy....it could have been after she started seeing the visions but she choose to live a simple life.
4,A Bit Disappointed,"I saw this film in the French edition, some years ago. I was very moved by it then, although my knowledge of French is pitiable! I can't explain why this English language version is not so good. So 3.5 STARS, rounded up to 4."
2,Disappointing portrayal of Bernadette,"I do not agree with the unquestioned assertions that this film is more historically accurate. A sometimes flippant, borderline sarcastic, and not very humble Bernadette portrayed in this film is not at all an accurate representation of her story. Accuracy is not determined by chronology but by accurate representation of the Catholic imagination, which was brilliantly captured by Jewish author Franz Werfel, upon which the vastly superior film ""Song of Bernadette"" was based.God chooses the lowly to give witness does not mean he chooses someone we would like to think of as being just like us, in all our splendid stupidity and shallowness. No. The saintly are and were different than us and deserve to be shown more respect that this film manages to do. Actually the sequel to this film, The Passion of Bernadette, is far superior, because Bernadette is portrayed with a greater sensitivity and greater level of holiness."
1,poor,"The DVD and its replacement did not live up to its expectation. Both were faulty towards the end, i.e. unable to clearly view."
2,"Love the film, but the French version was distorted in 2 copies","I bought this for the French version, but had to return 2 copies, as there was skipping, green lines, etc. on both. I contacted the manufacturer, but never received a response. Probably a problem with the transfer. A shame, as I really like the film. But Amazon was really good about the exchange for the 1st copy, and refund on the 2nd."
1,Cannot for the life of me see what others like about this production,"Our family rented this movie in the hopes of purchasing it. This version of St. Bernadette's visions was so slow moving and halting, as well as inaccurate in the story line, that we could not finish it....it was PURGATORY! The old Song of Bernadette far surpasses. My suggestion: Rent it before you buy it."
4,Bushnell 8.5 x 45 binocular review,This product has excellent optics. Eye relief for eyeglass wearers is excellent. Lens caps provided with product do not stay on well and there is no way provided to retain them with the product when they are off. Single eyepiece focus adjustment is a little inconvenient to use. Case is too small to hold binoculars with neck strap on so I just close case as far as I can with the binocular strap sticking out and use that as case strap.
3,Poor For The Selling Price,These are a bit of a disappointment. The view and resolution are mediocre at best. I especially dislike the diopter adjustment which is activated by pulling out on the center focus adjusting knob. A slight change occurs to the left eye focus when this is done. This makes it difficult to get proper diopter adjustment. The case is too small for the binoculars with strap attached. If I were going to use these I would have to get another case. These would be a fair bino in the $100 to $125 price range in my opinion. Personally I much prefer my 8x40 Nikon EX porro prisms over these.
3,Good but not as great.,"I bought this two pack because of the great reviews for City Hall and I actually paid less for the two combined.So for City Hall...it was good but not great. I was funny and moving at times but I didn't find myself drawn into the story like I am with most KDramas. Overall it was enjoyable. Some of the content is suggestive so I would not recommend for family viewing.I am currently in the middle of Happy Together and although it was done in 1999 I am really enjoying it. I am very drawn into the story and the characters. I will say some of the content is a bit adult (one of the family members is a ""bar hostess""). I wouldn't recommend for family viewing."
2,Work but not how i spected...,even that that thing work.. i doesnt do a good job.. cuz when i put it onmy car started to accelerate more than normaly and the shifts were abnormal... i live in mexico thats the only thing because i didnt return it... cuz i already replacit with the original that was malfunctioning.. but even like that work better than this thing..
4,Dependably Entertaining,"I've been enjoying Miss Marple movies for some time, pretty much ran out of them, and although I prefer them to Poirot, it's delightful to realize that there's this whole new series (new to me, after having previously neglected it.) I love Brit murder mysteries, discovered lots of them on Netflix, and then wanted to own the DVDs. I have most of them, now. I particularly love the ones with lovely mansion interiors, and British village scenes, as well as the fashions. Done Suchet, Poirot's wit is as much in his facial expressions as in his speech. He can say so much by the raising of an eyebrow or by a hint of rolling his eyes!"
4,Poirot DVD Set,Great. Enjoyed watching it. Bought the first set to see if I like it. Will order more. It's going in my mystery dvd library.
2,3rd one's a charm,The first two of these pumps just viberate and didn't actually spin. The third seems to be working well so far. Maybe a little more R&D.
4,A Lengthy Volume of Perelman Prose,"Most of the Most of S.J. Perelman (part of the Humor and Wit series of Modern Library) is a lengthy, though abridged, volume of the Perelman pieces from 1930 - 1958, many of which originally appeared in the New Yorker, among other magazines. This book should not necessarily be read straight through, as I did to my slight regret, as it can become a little overwhelming. There is some dating in the material but it is more of a delight how little effect time has taken on the comedy. The best pieces are, without a doubt, the marvelous Cloudland Revisited sequences where the author looks at books and movies he admired in his youth to see what horrible things time, experience and maturity have done to them. These selections are the treasures of the volume. A fine look at the almost lost art of a certain form of humour writing at its height. A wonderful volume to be savoured slowly."
3,I've seen ll of these before,"If you own, or have read The Most of S J Perelman, buying this compilation attributed to Steve Martin is a waste of time and money and effort. It's almost an exact duplicate of The Most of S J Perelman. Whoever put it together just left out The Acres and Pains items. How can they put this on the market as a new book. I waited a few months for it, but luckily, I had some one I could give it to, who hadn't a copy of the original. Save your money and look for the first one. Better all around"
4,"Great Fit, 2007 NBS Silverado",Very good budget kit. It fit perfect in my 07 NBS Chevy Silverado. About the only thing that made me pause was that the shelf has two cut outs at the back which means you probably should not put anything really small in there that will fall through the back.
2,I thought you were talking about another book!!,I thought this was the book that dealt with a bear and a woman forming a relationship. This novel that I am talking about describes very well what it's like. I was quite disappointed with this novel.
3,Good DVD,"We bought this DVD for our son - who loves Chuggington. UnfortunAtly, we got a bad disc, so the DVD is not fully watchable (the first episode freezes, so for him to watch it we have to skip the first one and run them one at a time). Now you may wonder why I gave it 3 stars then - here's the thing. My son could care less if the one episode freezes. It's more of a pain for me. Most of the other Chuggington DVDs have been in great condition. Top it off that this one was not very expensive, and let's face it - DVDs are fragile and will scratch easily - either in production or from standard use - it was still a good bargain. A couple bad DVDs (I had one other one that came with a scratch too) will not keep me from buying more in the future."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this product because my closet has 2 rods..one above the other. I am unable to reach the top rods and hang clothes up...or remove the hangers from the rod. This product seemed like the solution for me. However, I am unable to use it for my purposes because it doesn't seem to work for me. Very disappointing."
4,Robi rocks!!!,"Mad Love is overflowing with spontaneity, passion, and emotion, from the spacey, ethereal crescendos of ""My Eyes Adore You,"" to the bluesy, rippling guitar work in ""Lie Without a Lover,"" and the sexy smooth groove of ""Dancing in the Rain."" The spirit of flamenco and Iggy Pop & the Stooges lurk in the background, and seemingly everywhere are those freaky muted trumpets, a testament to Miles Davis cool. I truly recommend this album to anyone who truly loves great rock music."
1,Please stop the split screen shots!,"Looks like someone showed the director how to do split screen and partial screen shots on his computer, and he went absolutely nuts. The WHOLE movie is presented in this manner. It becomes very distracting, it's hard to emerse yourself in a story when you are constantly reminded that you are watching a film due to the overuse of a particual technique. That alone pretty much ruined the film for me. I guess you have to do something to cover up for a poorly written, shot and directed mess. Oh, and the music sucks too, unless you like guitar notes and chords held into lengthy sustained feedback. Gave me a headache."
2,Spiral Bulb,Purchased three colored spiral bulbs on a whim and two of the three did not light...the one working blue bulb has the effects we sought in a sports lamp...Have been an Amazon customer for quite a few years so am not concerned as to their customer orientation or principles...will stick with books !
2,No light in the dark,These bulbs work but they put off almost no lighting. You surely cannot use them to light your room.. I was not impressed.
2,out dated ideas,As a birthparent counselor of many years I was looking for some fresh ideas. I did not find that in this book. Instead I found societal misconceptions and outdated schools of thought. Didn't seem very affirming! Sorry!
1,There are many better books out there.,"My school uses this book for an object oriented programming course. 3 years ago, this book would have been considered okay. (This book was published in 1995)But now, it is outdated and the author does not seem to know about the existence of the STL then, instead, he's promoting his own template library.The book is relatively cryptic and the layout is extremely poor.To the book's credit, a relatively wide range of topics is covered. Too bad it's really outdated today.The verdict? Skip this book, I heartily recommend ""Teach Yourself C++"" by Herbert Schildt if you are a beginner. If you are already an experienced C++ programmer, there is no reason why you would want to buy this book."
1,Makes easy concepts difficult to understand,"The author has a habit of reinventing the wheel, for example instead of ""*this"" he uses ""self"".His programming conventions have also confused many novice programmers. Some have misunderstood his conventions as C++ syntax.Horstmann's writing are too short to be clear and he does not illustrate them with sufficent sample codes. Usually leaves the reader confused.Forget about this book, if you wish to learn OO go for Jacobson, if you wish to learn C++ go for Stroustrup."
4,Easy to use,"Dr.Dunbar is so enjoyable to watch and his love of dogs is so evident. His patience and creativity are inspiring . I watch the DVD repeatedly, each time picking up a new tidbit. For the cost, however, I wish there were MORE tidbits of specific information re: challenging puppy's behaviors."
3,Needs updating,"Well Dr. Dunbar has good advice but the tape was not quite what I expected for $100 price tag. It was a video of an 8 week puppy class. The videography did not seem professional. It was set in England at a mansion. At times the sound is poor. The first 2 tapes were nothing new. Second two tapes had a little more advanced info. If you are a first time puppy owner, this is for you. If like me, you were looking for more advanced info. this is probably not the right video."
4,"Good translation, interesting approach","A must have book for the serious scholar of classical mythology. Veyne follows the French school of Structuralism so the reader needs to be familiar with this method of scholarship to evaluate his interpreations and logic. Whether or not you agree with Veyne, you should be aware of his work. Wissing does a good job of translation the often difficult to decipher academic French."
2,Definitely not for twenty something guys,"I suppose any movie that is based on a book that was once featured in the Operah book club will suggest who this movie is made for, middle aged women. I'm sure there are exceptions to that, but this is not the movie. When two semi middle aged women relationships fail because their husbands are unfaithful or emotionally unavailable switch places, a series of predictable coincidences quickly follows."
4,Not Bad...For a Chick Flick,"Although Tara Road is not my normal kind of movie, it held my attention throughout, and almost managed to bring some tears to my eyes at the end. Almost.Well-acted, but a little slow, the story focuses on how two women's lives are altered one summer when they decide to trade houses in order to escape the harsh realities of their current situations. All the actresses and actors perform well.If you like Lifetime movies, you'll enjoy this.Guys, you'll score some serious brownie points for sitting through it!"
3,Not my cup of tea.,"When I first read about this movie, I saw similarities with the plot forThe Holiday(with Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz). Like The Holiday, two women decide to exchange homes. However, I liked The Holiday more than I liked Tara Road.I understand the film was based on Maeve Binchy's novelTara Road. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the film more if I had read the book. At any rate, I felt that Tara Road was a bit of a slow starter, and some of the performances fell flat for me (in particular, Andie McDowell), with the exception of Stephen Rea. The DVD has only one extra -- an interview with Maeve Binchy herself, which I found superfluous, as Binchy summarizes the plot and I had just watched the film.If you're looking for a good chick flick, Tara Road might fit the bill for you. It was not, however, my cup of tea."
5,Enjoyable Page Turner!,Enzo's Splendid Garden was a hillarious book. I think I enjoyed it as much as my daughter. We laughed and couldn't wait to see the next event come to the page. I recommend for the person who's had a bad day or just wants to keep the good day coming.
5,"Polacco is superb, as always","In Polacco's rollicking, urban version of ""The House That Jack Built,"" the story begins innocuously enough with a tiny bee landing on a tree near an outdoor cafe. A little boy leans over to examines the bee and eventually--of course!--all hell breaks loose, spiraling out of control from this original, innocent action.Kids will love the rhyming, rhythmic pace of the book, and adults will appreciate the tiny, out-of-the-way details such as the fountain cherub eventually coming down out of her stiff stance at the center of spraying water and helping everyone else at the restaurant gawk at what's going on--not to mention the fact that the original offending bee appears throughout in every single picture.Polacco has--no surprise here--done it again!"
1,Disappointing book,"Patricia Polacco uses the repetitive genre similar to There's a Bear in the Woods in her book In Enzo's Splendid Garden. Although there are humorous moments, my daughter, age 7, was completely bored. She much more appreciates Polacco's narrative storytelling in books such as Thank You, Mr. Falker."
4,Flying the old fashioned way,"As a pilot myself, this book really captures the way it was for the early pioneers of commercial flying. The collection of stories takes you from the beginning of the use of DC-3's for hauling mail, to the advent of flying passengers on regular routes and into the age of jets. Many of the stories are about flying the moutain states, back in a day when DC-3's could barely get over the terrain, as the passengers sat in the unpressurized cabin oblivious to the skills of the pilot's up front. With the little navigation equipment they had then compared to now, you get a real appreciation of how good these pilots were and how frustrated they felt as they aged to be confronted with mandatory retirement at a time when their experience still made them the best pilot's in the air.As enjoyable are the many stories of the pilot's antics, to break up the monotony of the flying, mostly at the expense of the cabin attendants, ground crews and rookie first officers"
5,Great Value,I really like this product. First it is an excellent product for those of us who can't take statins and works just as well without the side effects. But what makes it even better is that you can purchase it in this large a size the for good price. Makes for a great value.
3,Interesting!,"The 1st symphony is more tonal than the others, and with many melancholy and sinister undertones, and the touches of bird calls add some atmosphere - remaniscent of Cantus Arcticus (qv). The second is very dissonant, and interesting in its way. The third, in my opinion the best and most interesting, has contrasts, mixing tonality and atonality from the 1st and 2nd symphonies respectively, and also mixing romanticism with 12-tone serialism - the 1st mvt seems to come out of silence, with some short runs on the wind instruments. The ""Sehr Schnell"" mvt, my favourite of all the CD tracks, is a very lively dance-like movement.I recommend this CD to those who generally like modern symphonies."
2,Warning: Contains Birdcalls!,Some fairly interesting music ruined by the sound effect of bird calls in the first symphony. New age nuts will eat this up with a spoon.
5,Just right,"Costs more than most, but worth it. My last cheap one burst over the winter. This one has been through two New York winters, still works well and looks great."
4,Simple Share 500 as NAS,The drive works as advertised and even serves as a print server. It is not the fastest drive around but maybe my network is the problem. Am very satisfied and have highly recommended the Simple Share 500 to others. I may even purchase another as a video server if I can get my WI-FI speed up.
3,Does not work with MacMini's,I purchased this unit specifically to use with my PC (AMD 4800) and A Intel MacMini and the unit does not work with my MacMini. Very disappointing. Hopefully a patch or workaround is being worked on. I hear it has something to do with the Upgrade to 10.4.whatever.......
3,24 Hours in.......,This is a good pick to get your foot in the door on a NAS (network attached storage). It is a little difficult to set up on a Mac. If you copy the cd to your Harddrive then do the nas finder you will save loads of time. It is all easy sailing after that. Anyway as far as the drive it self. It is great just a little slow when on a wireless network. But thats the network not the drive. I would give it a 3.8 out of 5.
3,great but...,"I actually have the 250gb version of this drive. I used it as a back up and a share drive for my small home network. It also was a port to share my two printers. For the past year it has worked great and then just like that it died. Ironic since it is also my back up drive. The tech guy said that since I had it on for a year straight I was really putting it to work. Whatever, I did not realize that I should have turned it off now and then.So beware, don't keep it running at all times. Makes sense I guess but kinda a pain.so three stars because it failed after one year, at least there is a warranty and lucky for me I backed up my back up drive. crazy..."
2,Can be better engineered,"Heat is my main concern... The drive runs HOT, I mean very hot... There's no built-in cooling mechanism except the auluminum case to radiate the heat and it's not adequate... I had to open the case, drilled a few dozens holes and attached a fan to the outside of the case to draw out the heat... After all is done, the drive runs much cooler, but also noisy because of the fan... But I rather having it a bit noisy and knowing that it's not going to fail due to the heat."
1,MAC not 100% friendly - check compatibility with your OS on the web.,"I have spent hours to have this drive working to finally learn on web forums that it was not compatible with OS 10.4.10, despite the Mac compatibility logo on the box !The non compatibility is known from the manufacturer and identified on their website : compatibility is OK for prior versions anyway - Check OS Compatibility.5 stars for amazon which managed the reimbursement perfectely."
1,"Stay away from this difficult prodcut, unless you have hours and hours.","Product requires two software installs that have endless menues. Unit runs very hot,even in open air. Only would recommend if you are an ""Expert."""
5,Works great,"I have no complants, I have vista and it has worked great. i have not used the online features, due to the problems with vista and the simple share not playing well together. Otherwise and great product."
1,Don't buy this item!!!!,"This disk worked for a one day only. Later I did a shutdown to the disk and the next day I couldn't restart the unit. Today I'm trying to start the disk, yet!"
1,Not Vista Compatible,"I set up the SimpleShare 500 today, and it was ""not discoverable"" on my plain vanilla home network.I called Simple tech support, and after a few diagnostics, they said it will not work with Vista.I wish I knew before ordering!"
1,Zero security,"Do not buy this device if you are concerned about the security of your data. The share folders that are created cannot be protected from local users. You cannot make them read only, or write protect them, or stop users from deleting the data they contain. The vendor's website states in several places that you can ""secure files on a network"" I give this device one star only because the review form does not allow me to indicate zero stars."
4,Easy to setup,"I got this product for about $140, and it worked right out the box. Very easy to setup. Data transfer is quite fast. Impressed with the price of this NAS for less than $150."
1,Doesn't Fit,"I thought we had finally found a way to store all those tiny tub toys. We can't use suction cups because the walls of our tub area are a textured plastic, and the suction cups don't stick. I was so excited to find this pelican that just sits on the edge of the tub. Imagine my disappointment when I took it out of the box to find it does not fit on the side of my tub. We have a basic one piece tub/shower wall unit (the kind they were installing in new builds in the 80's), so I figured it would be a no brainer. The darn thing just won't fit. It does not ""fit most tubs"" as the package proclaims. If your tub is wider than about six inches, it will not fit!"
2,Just doesn't work in tub,"Didn't think of it when I ordered but can't be used if you have sliding glass doors on tub. Ended up costing me $6.00 shipping fee to return & a $4.00 restocking charge. Lesson learned, be careful what you order."
4,Great oral motor activities...,"It has homework pages that show how the oral motor activities should be produced and motivatng activities. There is also a card game in color for the activities. I think it is a great resource for carryover work, but the Mighty Mouth Game is more fun."
4,Stands well on its own merits,"Pan is a quasi classical score much like say, a J. Williams one. It it is entertaining with highly varied orchestration and has a brooding laid-back tone poem like feel."
5,beautiful,"I haunting, beautiful soundtrack that resonates in you long after it ends, just like the movie"
5,Baldacci's Best,"In this Book, Baldacci dives into the workings of the Supreme Court. The book deals with an appeal sent to the Supreme Court by a prisoner named Rufus. A young clerk looks at the appeal and decide to take it from the mail room. Little did he know that this would set in motion a chain of events that would take on some of the most powerful people in the Governemnt.Filled with great information about the Supereme Court and the way things get done in our country Baldacci, a lawyer form Virginia, take you on a ride to unravel an old conspiracy in our government's history. One of Baldacci's finest."
4,excellent storyline> multiple characters woven together to make a very entertaining read,Excellent storyline. Multiple characeters woven together to make a very entertaining read. Different than his other books. Liked it a lot.
4,Non-Stop Page Turner,This is the first Baldacci book I read and it was thrilling. I found myself reacting verbally to the many surprises. Definitely recommend this one.
3,Fair Book - some suspense - Not Balducci's best,"The plot has potential and starts off well. The characters seem quite interesting and Balducci gets you interested in them - however the relationships grow quite wane - the suspense lags - the plot becomes illogical, especially the description and aftermath of one of the major character's escape from prison. The book doesn't hold onto your interest simply because you begin to lose interest in the characters due to the lack of plot suspense and cohesion."
4,Good page turner,"I read this book on a long plane trip. Like his other books, it was a fun read. Like his others, it was preposterous. Since I've had some practice reading the others, I was able to guess who most of the villains were. However, he puts enough twists and turns in the book to keep you guessing."
2,Starts strong. Finishes with a sickening thud!,"Okay, you know the plot by now and there's nothing I like better than a good ole' page-turner, but c'mon, this book is one big tease. It sets you up with a promising start and basically, unravels with a truck load of cliches that leave you wondering if it's too late to get your twenty bucks back from Amazon."
3,"This was no ""Absolute Power""","I was disappointed. I loved Absolute Power, and really liked Total Control, but this one never seemed to get off the ground. I knew what they did to Rufus, and I knew who the ""bad guy"" was - no suprises there. It was a quick, easy read, but that's about it."
3,A great hear!,"I listened to The Simple Truth on a long drive from Albuquerque to Los Angeles. Baldacci creates superb suspense surrounding the real reason for prisoner Rufus Harms's appeal to the supreme court. Following that revelation, however, there is an attempt to wrap up both plot and characters too tidily. We can count on a movie for the novel sounds like a scenario."
3,Disappointing,"I've read all of Mr Baldacci's books: this one was really disappointing. As always, his build up to the climax when all is revealed (as in all his other 3 books) was suspensful, but this time round, the ending was very superficial. I felt rather cheated at the end with the simplistic ending. The main characters John and Sarah, seemed self-absorbed and highly unendearing, particularly so for the desperate Sarah. A disappointing read."
2,Save your money,"This book manages to be far-fetched yet predictable at the same time. The plot -- bad white men in the Army cause a sweet, deeply religious black man to kill a little girl. (I never did understand WHY they did what they did to him). They then engage -- for 25 years -- in an incredibly incredible conspiracy to cover it all up as they continue to torment the very nice man in prison. The bad guys really want to kill the good guy but somehow keep messing it up -- over and over again. The backdrop of the behind-the-scenes workings of the Supreme Court is pretty interesting but does not save the book. Even for a standard-issue legal thriller, this one falls short."
1,Scooby Doo Mystery,"While I found the setting in the Supreme Court fascinating along with the technical explanations of how appeals are reviewed, the story is hinged upon implausible memory recovery and characters that do anything but what is appropriate at every turn. I was disappointed with the way the characters acted unrealistically from the beginning of the book, but the ending takes the cake with the most embarrassing to read uncovering of facts along with surprise (gee whiz!) bad guys and good guys since Scooby and Shaggy were on the case. The writing style is fast-paced (my first experience with this author), but the plotting went well beyond ruining my suspension of disbelief and in the end I really didn't care what happened to the characters because I couldn't identify with any of them. I can't recommend this book and doubt I will try the author again."
4,Excellent read,Thoroughly gripping. I had a hard time putting this book down just to sleep. I'd also recommend the Tenth Justice by Brad Meltzer which also deals with Supreme Court clerks
1,Somnolent Thriller,"Yawn... this ""thriller"" was one of the most boring books I've read. The only reason I finished it was due to being in a hospital bed with nothing else to read. The actions and characters are ridiculous and so poorly drawn the reader cares nothing for any of them. All emotions and personality traits of the characters felt forced and phony, as if the author pulled them out of a bad B grade movie cast. I'd never read Baldacci before and seriously doubt I will again."
2,"Good characters and plot, but novel fails to deliver",Baldacci has created a great plot about a death row inmate who is actually innocent who escapes from jail and is aided by a Supreme Court clerk and her dead boyfriend's brother. All of the main characters are interesting and have great depth.Yet the background characters are confusing and the action scenes are boring. Baldacci was unable to combine the characters and plot into a good story.
1,Very disappointing,"I read and loved ""Total Control"" and ""The Winner"" and also enjoyed the movie ""Absolute Power"". I couldn't wait to read this book. But after slogging through the first 50 or so pages not just once but twice and failing to enjoy it or keep the characters straight, I finally gave up. Hopefully his next novel will be better."
2,Son of Grisham,"Book was recommended to me--I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. Like Mr. Grisham, Baldacci takes a superb plot and gums up the works with fifth-grade prose.I guess some would consider this stuff excellent beach reading, but the writer, aside from poor sentence structure, flat bad usage (""he placed the letter in the envelope""--are there any editors out there?), makes it sooo tough to align oneself with any character.A lawyer is portrayed as a crusader, then a bumbler. A Supreme Court justice waffles, then becomes a hero. Cheese, at least most of the bad guys stay bad.Perhaps a better title would have been ""The Yellow Mile,"" if only our prisoner had been on death row."
1,Funny -- But not meant to be,"This is probably the worst book I've ever read.A patent plot (when not obvious, merely outrageous) and so over-written I often had to stop and laugh. The characters are unbelievable, their actions incredible, and the dialogue often ridiculous. Then Baldacci must have run the manuscript through some runaway Thesaurus program to find some of the descriptive phrases: ""water"" for ""tears"" is one example that comes to my mind, but there were hundreds of them.If I had been reading the book instead of listening to an unabridged tape version that I had rented I wouldn't have gotten half-way through. On the other hand I would have missed a lot. None if it good, but a lot of it.What ever happened to editors? If Baldacci thinks he's so good that he doesn't need one, he's wrong."
3,Decent legal thriller,"This is my first foray into David Baldacci's legal thriller world and it probably won't be my last. Baldacci crafts a decent, if unspectacular, book about Rufus Harms, a black man locked away in prison for the brutal murder of a little girl. Harms, however, has a piece of paper from the United States Army that will exonerate him and he demands an appeal from his lawyer.This piece of paper quickly sets the plot in motion as a Supreme Court clerk finds it and later is murdered. John Fiske, the clerk's brother and Sara Evans, a clerk for one of the Supreme Court justices, start investigating. The romance is piddling and somewhat unecessary but the plot twists and turns nicely. You'll be able to pick out the other villains before the end, but it's a decent read."
3,Simple truth,Slow to start but became much better as it went on when the Baldacci style started to shine. Generally a good read. I gave it 31/2 stars due to the slow start and in later good parts was sometimes hard to put down.
1,Too Predictable,"Let me make a general remark first. Contemporary American writers lack the subtlety of writing a good piece of prose with a strong control over the storyline. They can be labelled as good story-tellers but not good novelists. (No, I'm not British and yes, Stephen King is an exception). Now, this was my first Baldacci and he holds true to my above remark. Very poor character configuration, no scene-settings at all, and above all, a very predictable ending. As for the storyline, well, it was all too bald. My first impression about Baldacci? Another storyteller in wake of so many getting advantage of a huge readership which is not introduced to intricacies of a novel yet."
3,An okay read,"This was not Baldacci's best effort. Some of the characters behaved unrealistically, in my opinion. Also, some of the plot intricacies were never fully explained. For instance, as stated on the back cover, ""Michael Fiske broke the law when he took [the] letter from the Supreme Court."" Why? Why did he take it? He's supposed to be a brilliant Supreme Court clerk. Why would he take the letter? And what woman would try to seduce a man the day he learns that his brother died? Was she out of her mind? The book was an okay vacation read, but I'd like to see another ""Absolute Power"" from Baldacci."
2,Just poor,"I loved Absolute Power and I enjoyed Total Control, but this was a disapointment. When I read the inside flap, I expected a good story, espicaly with the US Supreme Court involved. However, I felt the author was never able to set the scene or give the characters any depth. This isn't the worst book I have read, but it is close because it is all so mindless. The storyline was OK if the author had just been able to give some depth to the characters it could have been better. Overall, the wrost book by the author I have read so far."
1,Preposterous plot,"Baldacci is slipping badly, after a very impressive start in the writing life. This book's plot is so thin and contrived that it was a chore for me to finish it. I hate to give a bad review, because I've enjoyed his other stories, but this one gets a thumbs down. Back to the basics, David. Above all else, you must have a plausible story!"
2,Writing for the money!,"I have read everything that Baldacci has written and think of him as one of the premiere writers of our time in this genre. I must note that ""The Simple Truth"" reveals that it always ends up being about the money; write another book because you are a successful author and the paying public will buy it. It is hard to review a book that has already slipped into my subconscious. Weak plot surrounded by mundane characters and finished with a disjointed story that is completely unbelievable. The WOW factor is missing, the ""Baldacci"" details are noticeably absent and the color commentary is disappointing at best. There is none of the joining of reality and fiction for which the author is so famous. No Mr. Baldacci, this is not a work of the mind but a plea from the wallet. You sir, are better than this!"
1,Totally Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading another David Balducci book after being introduced to ""The Winner"" and enjoying it immensely. However, Mr Balducci has sorely disappointed me. This book was slow, boring and hardly worth the effort. I found that the concept of the storyline was intriguing but the story just didn't evolve and pull you in... Also there were too many characters floating around and the story just dragged right until the very end. Sorry, I would give this book the big thumbs down!"
4,Finished book,The book appeared to have a very slow start and hard to hang in there until the action began. Hard to keep characters straight in the beginning.
5,Another riviting page-turner,"Don't ask how (okay, it involves groveling to a very close friend in the book business), but I received an advance copy of The Simple Truth. My favorite Baldacci book is The Winner...and I'll admit, it remains the winner...but The Simple Truth delivers all the punch you'd hope for. I'm a fan of Baldacci not only for his ability to spin a great tale and to create compelling characters, but also for his willingness to treat each book as a new journey. He has not yet fallen into the dull pattern most young authors do who reach his level of fame and commercial success. He takes us to new places -- this time the Supreme Court -- and for new rides. But this book still delivers the Baldacci I enjoy. Plenty of turns and twists, really bad bad guys, good guys you really care about. All and all, another great suspense thriller in the Baldacci tradition."
5,"The simple truth is, this book will be NY Times #1!","As a prolific reader, I was rewarded with an advance copy of Baldacci's newest thriller, The Simple Truth. In order to create the perfect atmosphere, I hung a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my beach chair and spent a glorious day devouring this book. In my opinion, this novel should serve as a ""how to"" for authors who need help in connecting characters and multiple mini-plots. Also, The Simple Truth will appeal to action fans, courtroom junkies, and even Oprah devotees. It has been quite a while since I re-read sentences because I felt the message was profound. In summary, The Simple Truth will establish David Baldacci as the most versatile author of the '90's."
1,Another simple truth,"If you're like me, you will continue reading a book out of sheer grit or because one glimmer of interest in plot resolution still remains. That is why I read ""The Simple Truth"" to the bitter end, although I came to resent the investment of time in following this hackneyed, predictable and ho-hum story. This Baldacci ""thriller"" is not thrilling, believable, or the kind of good read you expect from a purported blockbuster."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I threw this book across the room in disgust, leaving the last 40 or so pages unread. A stupid plot with totally unbelieveable characters, motives, dialogue, and situations. A real disappointment. Is the author becoming just another hack looking to make a fast buck by living off the success achieved with Absolute Power? This book doesn't deserve to be on the same shelf."
4,entertaining,"Complex enough to keep my interest but simple enough to not get bogged down. I liked the characters. They were just flawed enough to be real but not too perfect. The reviews misled me into thinking it was much more violent than it was. But I still liked it. This is the first time I had read this author, it won't be the last."
4,"Great reading, even if somewhat farfetched","Like all books by David Baldacci, I finished this one in just a couple of days time (and I'm a slow reader!). Also, like all his previous books, it provides for great reading, even though the subject matter is at times a bit farfetched (but we shouldn't really complain about that; otherwise we wouldn't have these kind of thrillers). Although I still think that his first book is his best, reading this one proved to me again that Baldacci is a very capable and reliable author and I definitely prefer his books to the latest Grisham!"
4,A solid page-turner.,"This book is a must-read for all you suspense fans. I couldn't put the book down for wanting to know ""who dunnit"". Baldacci really gets in-depth with his characterization of the main character, John Fiske, although I wish he had gone into more depth with the other characters. Once again, Baldacci delves into realism with his behind the scenes look at the Supreme Court and brings just the right amount of action and suspense into the story. Another great story from Baldacci!"
4,A fun read...,"I enjoyed The Simple Truth. I have read all of David Baldacci's novels. They are fun and hard to put down. However, as a dyslexic...Mr Baldacci's information was not quite accurate"
2,Not Great,"This is somewhat tedious because the writing is awful. The plot is decent, but that is limited consolation in such a cliched and badly written work."
4,"Not his best, but......","I've read almost all of Baldacci's books now and always find them to be compelling page-turners. This was no exception, though as other reviewers have pointed out, it was a bit slow during the first 100 pages or so. The only thing that holds this one back from 5 stars is the notion that the female lead (Sara)could fall in love, having never yet actually met the male lead (John). We are expected to believe she is a highly intelligent, critical component of the U.S. Supreme Court, yet turns a school girl crush into a full romance before even knowing the man. Also, towards the end, some of the twists and turns are a bit far-fetched, but that can often be said about Baldacci's books. That isn't a huge issue for me - it is like going to a great action or thriller movie. You are SUPPOSED to suspend belief to some degree! If you like his other books and haven't read this earlier novel, get to it!!"
3,Not the best of Baldacci,"This is an interesting book and is worth to read it, but many parts of the book are unreal, or at least is very difficult to believe, for example, at the end of the book the FBI agent knew everything and didn't do anything to solve the case until the end of the book. John Fisk hated his brother and he really didn't know why, and other things that if I write them here you will know the story before you read it.On the other hand the book will keep you reading almost all the time but is not the best of Baldacci."
3,Good easy read,"This is not a bad book for an easy weekend read. Baldacci's best since Absolute Power. The ending is a little corney, but the overall story moves quickly and keeps the readers attention."
2,A decent book until the end. . .,"I've read every one of Baldacci's books since his debut with Absolute Power (a great book). Unfortunately, this one does not live up to his others (actually, The Winner was sort of a dud as well). The book started off well and the initial character development was interesting. However, the end was far too predictable-by then I felt I was reading a screenplay instead of a novel. I'm sure Sandra O'Conner or Ruth Ginsberg took offense to his portrayal of the female member of the Supreme Court! I will continue to read his books, but my patience is running thin."
2,Baldacci writing on routine this time,"The book is a nice reader, but I think Baldacci has made it himself too easy by throwing in the same ingredients as the first books. I liked the first 3 books a lot but this..... As my title says: it's too much hanging on routine, you can clearly notice that ( that is for the readers of the other books of B.) further the plot was to simple. I hope Baldacci does better with his next one"
3,A page turner for those fast reading experiences,"Had it not been for the over exposure to topics pertaining to law by Grisham, I may have been more swayed for a higher rating. This book was good and enjoyable, but it is very similar to the vast array of suspense books out there. I'm finding that too many writers are going for the entertainment value over great writing. That's just my opinion. If you like Grisham, Stuart Woods, etc...you'll like this book. But, you will be familiar with the style. It's a fast read and good for airplane, train, etc..trips."
1,Awful! Avoid at all cost,"Where to begin? How about a checklist:1) Unbelievable plot with holes a-plenty........check2) Uninteresting, uninspired characters..........check3) Amateurish dialogue..........check4) Unintentionally comedic action scenes..........check5) Overstuffed and unedited.......checkEasily the worst book I've read in 5 yearsI found myself shaking my head and laughing out loud more than once, but I was laughing at it, not with it!Imagine, if you will, speeding down a dried river bed in a pick-up truck with killers in close pursuit! To evade the bad guys one of our protagonists, the driver, says ""take the wheel"" and proceeds to lean out the driver window and shoot down, with a handgun, a large tree limb in front of them which barely misses their truck but manages to block the bad guys!That's the good stuff! I can't imagine the kind of crap that the people that gave this 5 stars are used to reading!"
3,"Quite good, but predictable","I enjoyed the book but I thought the plot was was a little too obvious.. It's not that much fun when you figure out who the bad guy is before the ending! Very well written though, I would certainly recommend it."
2,Way below par for Baldacci,"I was a huge Baldacci fan until I read The Simple Truth. It was ""preachy"" and obviously attempting to be politically correct; his characters were caricatures of conservatives, liberals, southerners and blacks. Baldacci's women always seem to me to be the weakest part of his novels, and this one was especially bad in that department. For some reason I find his women very hard to like. His old or out-of-the-ordinary characters seem to be his best. I hope Mr. Baldacci finds his feet again because his other novels were very enjoyable to me."
2,Who Edited this Book?,"Grisham Light. While this book is a page turner it is one of the more poorly written books I have ever read. It is difficult to believe that an editor reviewed the text and ""passed"" on the product. The plot has potential and it will keep your interest, but some Superman comics can keep your interest as well."
2,Two stars,"I know this book word by word... Well, actually, I translated it into Polish. It was my first encounter with Mr. Baldacci's work, and as an introduction it was rather disappointing. The book itself is at least very predictable. Several twists of action is based on pure bit of luck, and sugar-sweet Rufus Harms looks like a character from another story. Moreover, before one-third of the book I knew pretty well who is the Big Bad Guy. Two stars: one for the real surprise (McKenna), and one for fast-paced action. That's all."
3,Not up to Baldacci standards,"In keeping with the trend that his odd number releases are superb, while the even number releases are solidly average, this book is an average read at best. It never grabbed you from the start like Absolute Power or the Winner, and developed as a fairly predictable story. Being an avid Baldacci fan, I was disappointed by this showing."
4,"Excellent, griping to the end.","I'm not much of a reviewer, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bought it at airport for travel reading and couldn't put it down. I was afraid it was going to be anti-climatic because all the info given up front. The book did not dissapoint, I enjoyed it to the last page."
3,Good Novel,"I really liked the supporting characters; especially the Harms brothers. The investigation was very intriguing. But the love story felt very forced. It really didn't provide anything to the story, either.SPOILER:I'm not sure why Michael proposed to Sara. It didn't sound like they were anything more than friends. And it didn't make sense for Sara and John to hook up so soon after Michael's death.END SPOILERWith some simple editing, this would make an excellent film. Terry Crews as Josh and Michael Clark Duncan as Rufus."
2,This book was horrid,"Yuck! First of all, no plot to make me want to read it...Ever had one of those books that you could skip 50 pages and understand everything that went on? Yeah, this is that kinda book! The characters were ridiculous and from the first mention of each of the characters, you can call the ending..."
1,"""Large Print""...no so much","I ordered a ""large print""edition of a book; the font size was larger than a normal book, but not so large as what I believe to be ""standard"" large print; i.e., the type the recipient is accostomed to getting from his local library, and what I had expected from you. He can read the book, but only a page or so at a time....hence, I'm rather disappointed with my purchase."
2,NOT A LEGAL THRILLER,"When I first got the book I thought it would be like John Grisham's books. It wasn't even close to it. The first half of the book was so boring. Only like the second half does the book get exciting. I wouldn't even call it exciting. This should be like a mystery book instead of a courtroom thriller. It didn't have like a big courtroom drama or anything like that. If you want a good courtroom thriller, look into John Grisham books."
3,In the tradition of English dub rock.,Leaving the beach late at night? Driving along less than crowded streets at sundown with the window open? Then this is perfect for you. In the tradition of English bands who love their dub (or anything from a guy Ritchie movie). These guys layer 60's pop/ 70's soul and 80's raggae into a new shiny product that is pleasingly arranged.This is very 'cool' music.
2,A disappoitment,"I loved ""Free the Bees"", but I don't care much for this album. Maybe a few more listens, but I don't think so."
5,My second copy!,"This book is basic and clear, but extremely informative. I purchased it when it was released 20 years ago and somehow lost it over the years. Now back in the gym I thought it would be nice to have on my bookshelf again so I went to Amazon to re-purchase."
4,Very informitive for the novice,This is a great book to learn different weight lifting exercises. The pictures show alot. The book could use more instruction on nutrition.
4,Good DVD,"This DVD really could have been better because they only talk about theyre 2 singles. They should talk about the rest of the cd also. All it has is 2 music vids: ""i feel so"", and ""there is"", and concert footage of those 2 songs also. In my opinion I was kinda disappointed because it talked about that song:""there is"" a lot, and i dont really like it. I was expecting more bcuz BCR is my fav band, i saw them in concert and they rocked, but this dvd is still well worth your 10$ ur gonna pay, so u should go get it. ""The End With You"" is the best song"
5,Readers get the key concepts in marketing research,This book provides readers the key concepts in marketing research. It is very easy to read and a good source to have if you are a beginer in this topic
3,"Agatha Christie's ""The Love Dedectives""",This was written early in her career for a magazine and thus it is short and lacks the intricacies of her later works but anything she wrote is better than most other writers so I was pleased to have a few minutes delight.Pat Bracey Greenwood
4,So they're a little older,"Train and other tracks on this CD are strong testimony to the continued strength of this quartet. Their harmonies are dynamic, and if Duane Allen's lead sounds a little aged from time to time, the overall quality of the Oaks' performance is still very satisfying."
5,THE REAL DEAL!! PURE COCOA BUTTER!,"LISTEN UP, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WORKS FOR STRETCH MARKS ON WOMEN WHO JUST HAD BABYS, BUT THIS WORKS ON MY DRY AND FLAKEY SKIN BETTER THAN THE TWO PRESCRIPTION CREAMS MY DOCTOR GAVE ME!! BESIDES COSTING LESS THAN 1/2% OF WHAT THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS COST!!WONDER STUFF, ORDERING MORE----IT'S MY NEW AND INEXPENSIVE GET YOUNG SKIN AGAIN CREAM, I'M 63 Y/O AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN LOOK YOUNG AND FEEL BABY SOFT!! BUY IT!!Queen Helene, 100% Cocoa Butter Stick, 1 oz"
1,"Great product, Messed up amazon ad","These sticks are great! They smell delicious like chocolate, they just melt onto your body, and the butter absorbs into your skin completely, so no greasy left over residue. Applicator is a bit cheap, and beware leaving them in a hot car lol(they will melt quite easily). Makes skin silky smooth though, and good for all over: hands, legs, lips...Now why anyone would spend such a high price when they sell this product in stores for $2.40 and elsewhere even on amazon for less than that? I have really no idea. You should buy elsewhere, but definitely recommended!"
4,Does the job but wire gauge is a little thin.,"This cage was easy to setup. The only a couple of gripes. First, the gauge of the wire is thin compared to other cages reviewed locally. The bottom seems to be pretty durable. The dog has gone crazy on it, digging. However the bottom sustained minimal damage. Second issue is that the latches used to hold the front of the cage do not work well. I recommend investing in tie wraps to hold the cage snaps in place where the door is (pushing on it causes the front of the cage to disconnect from the latches.)"
4,Great value,"Crate has been great for our boxer mix puppy. The divider is wonderful as we've been able to make a snug spot for him so he is not tempted to potty in a far corner. Good construction. Not very easy to break down, so not good for short trips in car."
4,surfone plumeria,"After about a 25 year hiatus, the surfone plumeria has been my reentry into skateboarding and my first longboard. What a blast, it's fast, fun and responsive and carves pretty nicely. It's kicktail allows for some old school style maneuvers and seems stable enough for an old geez like myself to crosswalk and ride the nose."
5,Got one of the last ones in the world!,"I bought this for my son, and I cant believe this was one of the last ones ever being released. Its now rare, and I love how impressive this board looks."
1,Bumble and Bumble Shampoo,To :Amazon Customer ServiceI will be contacted the two companies I purchased Bubmble and Bumble Products from and insist upon a refund. The products ARE NOT BUMBLE/BUMBLE. They have subsituted other hair productrs. I have used these products for many years. Please be aware the AMAZON is upporting dishonest business practices and Bumble/Bumble should also be alerted.Alice Miller
4,"Terrific stuff, Expensive but Lasts a Long Time","I first tried this in a sample that came with the thickening conditioner and I quickly started to love it. The shampoo gives great body and volume, I use it every day and it works terrific over and over. There isn't much of a smell which is good, I'm a guy and I don't like strong smelling shampoo especially if it's a girly smell. I find that it does come out a little quickly when you squeeze it so sometimes I get more then I wanted. You really only need a small dime size for shorter hair. Overall it's great, out of the ones I've tried before this stuff takes first prize."
2,"Ok but expensive,cheaper alternatives",After reading reviews of how great this product was decided to give it a try...smells like pure aloe vera. Also did leave hair looking thicker right after wash but by next day very limp and thin looking again. Redken for Men NYC is a much better and cheaper alternative. And L'Oreal Pantene gave me the same results at a third of the price. Would not buy again and stick to Redken for Men
1,Does not thicken,"I didn't notice any thickening, so I just used it until it was gone and never bought it again. I love the Bumble and Bumble Moisturizing Coco smelling one though, and have been using that for almost 3 years now."
4,Works Well!,"I heard that some volumizing products are actually drying to your hair, so I was concerned about this issue when I purchased Bb's Thickening shampoo. I have not had any problems with drying and it does give my fine, thin hair more volume. Also, 8 oz's doesn't seem like alot, but it is very concentrated. You need less than half the amount you would use with off the shelf products."
1,a heads up,"So I read reviews here and noticed the comments about fake products and that the actual B&B site is cheaper. I decided to check it out and it IS! It's $23 and free shipping! Plus with a code you get 7 free gifts, which I'm sure are samples but so what! FREE is FREE! I read about the product in Women's Health so hopefully I won't be disappointed...can't wait to try it out!"
2,Awful audio,"This instructional DVD, while good in content, is accoustically flawed -- so much so that I found listening to be an effort. The sound was saturated by background noise from the river, and the narrators were almost shouting -- I assume to overcome the interfering noise. Most cordless (""lapel"") mics are highly omnidirectional, and it appears they were used for ""Introduction to Spey Casting."" But there are directional models with sensitivity adjustments, and these would have been a better choice. So would mics affixed closer to the narrators' mouths."
5,A delight for the classic Porsche enthusiast,"My husband is a serious classic Porsche enthusiast and thought he already had every coffee table book. Not only was this new to him, but he was delighted to see that this wasn't a re-hash of information and images from other books. There's lots of eye candy and no shortage of technical revelations."
3,Average Cleanser,"I think it is important to write a review especially for facial products after using them for a couple months. I bought this to battle my acne, and it didn't really do much for it. Acne amount stayed the same. It does make you feel more clean because after you wash it off it your face will feel much more firm.Also for the price, you are getting a ton of product. I think this stuff was meant to be used in a foam dispenser. It is super runny if you try to take it out onto your hand, but it lathers up with just a small amount. It smells VERY strong as well, but I wouldn't have cared if it helped my skin."
3,"Used to work, til company changed it","I have been using this product for years, and it used to work great. However, the company has changed the label and design of the product recently, and it doesn't seem to be the same. The label says it's the same formula, and just a new look. But it can't be the same. It doesn't work nearly as well as it used to. And when I compared the ingredients to the old style design, they seemed to be a little different.I think it's a shame that the company changed the product because it used to work so well. However, other people seem to be praising it, so I would say it's definitely worth a try. Has anyone else noticed the product not working well since they changed the label?"
3,"Not for normal skin, I suppose","It's a decent product, and the smell is not as bad as with other tea tree products I've used. Unlike the other reviewers, though, I do find this soap to be a little over-drying. I don't know if it's because their skin is oily while mine is normal-to-dry (after the disastrous decision to use accutane in my youth), but I definitely have to use moisturizer after using this soap. I haven't really seen a benefit to it over generic face soaps, but there is the good-feeling factor that you're using a natural product, and the price is very good for the quantity. Still, the resulting dryness kills it for me."
2,"Dry out my skin, smells like medicine","Terrible medicine, unnatural smell. And the soap dries out my skin after two uses. I just can't get passed the smell"
4,works great (esp. for bleph sufferers),"So far I've been using the Desert Essence cleanser 2x a day for about a week and I can't even begin to describe the wonders it's done for me! I have blepharitis, an oily eyelid condition, and previous attempts to curb it with different facial washes, baby shampoo, and castor oil haven't come anywhere close to this product! I haven't used baby shampoo on my eyelids since using this product. :)The only ""downside"" is that while the cleanser seriously cuts down on the amount of oil that comes from my face, it doesn't treat acne in quite the same way that my previous cleanser did. But I just put on a 10% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment overnight and it fills in the ""gaps."" :)"
2,Not impressed...,"I was really excited to buy this because I thought it was such a great deal... 32 fl oz at a very reasonable price. However, I was pretty disappointed after trying it out. Two reasons: 1) It is extremely watery, making it hard to pour into your hands without losing half of it. And... 2) I've noticed that I've had more break-outs since I started using it. I read someone else's review about how coconut oil clogs pores so now I'm wondering if that's what it is."
4,Very Good Value,"I purchased this product as a recommendation from a friend. Given it's size and cost I thought it was worth a try. It has done at least as well as any other face wash for acne I have tried, if not better. It has taken a few weeks for me to see results. I use the product 3 times a day since my skin is more oily than average. Definitely worth a try!"
4,Great Deal,"This face wash smells great and seems to ""thoroughly"" clean my face, however I don't like the consistency. It is very watery. The quantity is a good deal for the price but I find myself using more than usual due to the consistency. I might switch back to aveda. Great face wash if your on a budget."
2,leaves skin feeling parched and with residue,"I am in my mid 20's with sensitive skin- i have eczema and combination skin ( an oily, acne prone t-zone). I bought this face wash thinking tea tree would be good on my acne. It is a very strong face wash: it is strong smelling and completely strips the skin of its natural oils.Tea tree oil is a DRY oil often used as an antibiotic, which is why they included it in this cleanser to prevent acne. However, when you strip the skin of its natural oils, it can only compensate by producing more oils... which can cause pimples. For that reason, this was not a right for me. It left my cheeks dry/flakey and my t-zone more oily."
5,Fantastic product!,"I love, love, love this facewash. It has helped clear up my skin (which is mega-oily and prone to blemishes), and improved my skin's appearance. It is definitely worth the try! This has worked infinitely better for me than some other three-step products. I don't want to talk it up too much, because I expected absolutely nothing when I first started using it and it has just been wonderful. Good luck!"
5,This is great stuff!!! I'm hooked! I used to use expensive washes.,"I saw a few negative adds and I just had to put in my two cents. I'm sorry some people have had a bad experience with this product but my experience has been wonderful. You have to close your eyes when you are lathering up because it can sting the eyes a bit but it's a small price to pay for my youthful, renewed skin afterwards. It does lather up really well and it doesn't take much to build a good lather when mixed with water on your skin. I'm so glad I found this and it is economical as well. I used to use Lancome and I wanted something that worked just as well but cheaper. This was exactly what I was looking for."
3,good makeup remover!,"I initially bought this after reading all the raves! My acne has not changed one bit after using this twice a day for a little over 1 month of consistent usage. It is really great for taking makeup off, with only some eyeliner residual left behind. Since it is cheap, this is a great alternative to cleansing oils, as the Origins brand is expensive and just as comparable. It is best to transfer it into a foam pumper or else I really don't know how others are managing its watery mess! A little goes a long way (just one pump). I still give it 3 stars since it does a good job taking makeup off and making your face feel clean. I have yet to see any acne clearing benefits!"
3,HELPS POSTULAR ROSACEA,Its difficult to find a product that reduces rosacea and doesn't harm your skin or is too harsh. This product is a wonderful face wash. It is great at calming my skin and preventing outbreaks of bumps and redness.
5,For Black Men,I have a job that requires me to shave all the time. At first i was using something called Florida's Best Tea Tree Acne Face Wash but it got too expensive so i started looking for similar product and not only is this product inexpensive but IF YOU USE IT EVERYDAY it will work. Stop wasting your time and get it
5,Love it!,Leaves my face feeling really clean and my skin clear..A little goes a long way.I love this product and love that it's all natural.
4,its working so far.,i heard tea tree oil was good for your skin and i have problem skin so i decided to give this a try. i like the smell and the way it lathers but it has a very watery consistency. It is helping my skin out so far but ive only been using this for 3 days so we will see.
3,watered down?,"this is by far the most watery facial cleaser i have ever used. eyes got irriated, face feels great after wash though. but it's not gonna last me as long as i expected. 5% essence, 95% water?"
3,Drys out skin,"I enjoy the smell of this cleanser and how effectively it works to remove all traces of dirt on my skin. One small problem is that it's a very liquidy soap, so it can go all over the place when I pump some for use. Another issue is that I have normal, mostly clear skin that can get dry sometimes and this cleanser exacerbated the dryness and stressed out my skin so my forehead broke out a little. I was going through a stressful time at school, so that may have been part of it, but I think I would recommend this only for summer cleansing or for those with oilier, more problematic skin."
5,I use this as a Natural Antiseptic!,"I use this soap on cuts, athletes foot, oily skin...I pretty much use this as a natural antiseptic for everything. It's the best!"
4,"""Fragrance Free"" - Allergic reactions","Since purchasing this product, I have been diagnosed with a severe allergy to fragrance. Is this product ""fragrance free""? I need to know before I continue using it."
2,face cleanser,I should have returned this but I didn't. It absouluty smelled horrible. I only used it twice because of this. I threw it away.
1,Not satisfied,I bought this product after reading good reviews but I was just not satisfied. The liquid smells terrible and I think I made a wrong choice. Very thin and difficult to get hold of it.
1,Horrible product,"I have nothing good to say about this product. I bought it recently and ended up pouring out 90% of it. There are a few issues I have with this product.1. It doesn't work. I found that it didn't really clean my skin, just left my skin extremely, extremely dry. If I ever got some on my lips while washing my face, I would have dried out, cracked lips soon afterwards.2. I really didn't like the smell of this product.3. I got a drop of it in my eye on accident. It was like liquid fire! It took over 24 hours before my eye stopped hurting!Avoid this product!"
1,Seller is not Reliable,I would not buy from this seller. I ordered product from them and I did not receive it when promised. I then e-mailed them asking for help and information with no response.
5,Daughter's favorite,This is the second time that I have purchased this product from Amazon. My teenage daughter raves about this face wash. It is hard to find the refill locally so I ordered it from Amazon. The product was promptly shipped and packaged properly. Don't hesitate to try it. You will be surprised.
2,Irritating,"I'm in my early 30s, have sensitive skin, and have been using Cetaphil for the past few years. I decided to find an all natural cleanser instead and went with this one. As with one of the previous reviewers this cleanser severely irritated my skin to the point of feeling like a sunburn. I will not be buying this cleanser again."
5,It worked for me,"Since using this wash, my acne has gone down about 75%, no other changes in my life.I'm a 36 year old male who has suffered mild to moderate adult acne. Tried other products and dermatologists to no avail since high school. I use a foam dispenser, this thing will last at least a year. Very pleasantly surprised."
1,Made it worse,"I began using this about a month ago. I have had issues with acne since I hit puberty. The only thing that has completely cleared my skin was Proactiv and hormonal birth control. Proactiv is horrible for your skin and would dry mine out. Hormonal birth control is not good for your body either, so I tried to go organic. After about three weeks of using this, my acne got worse; I kept getting huge pimples and whiteheads all over my face. I guess I will just have to keep looking."
2,Not the best cleanser,I am a skin therapist and like to try new products. Unfortunately this one was not one I would recommend. I tried it as a facial cleanser and the first bad thing was it burns terribly if you get it in or near your eyes. Even just washing it off got it into my eyes. Secondly it would leave my skin feeling so tight and dry that I would have to use a heavy duty moisturizer to relieve the tightness. The smell wasnt exactly the most pleasent either but tea tree oil kinda stinks anyway.
1,NOT FOR DRY SKIN!,"I ordered this with the label shown on this page. I got a bottle instead with a completely different label that said for ""oily and combination skin."" I could not find a single place in the text that had mentioned this. I have very dry skin and this face wash dries it out even more, makes the skin itchy around the eyes, etc. I would never have ordered this if I'd known it was not for dry skin. I don't know if I was sent the wrong product or not but you would think this information would be included in the text describing the product. Please think twice about ordering this product if you have dry skin!"
1,Kelp - horrible smell,"Kelp face wash has a horrible smell, I could not stand it - I am washing my feet with it. It also dries your skin a lot, and I did not like how my face felt after that. I am not buying this again."
2,Horrible Smell,My husband and I have tried giving this product a chance for two weeks now. While our skin looks great - we can barely stand the smell of this! It is horrible!
3,its ok,This is a good product but is too liquidy. It needs to be thicker. When you press the pump its almost like water and you can't keep it in your hand. It sloshes out. Because of the consistancey( or lack of) it is easy to get in your eyes since it runs right off your face. I'm going to mix it with another face cleaner that is thicker so that its not a total waste.
4,Great face wash,"I have some seriously sensitive facial skin, and this product is awesome.1) The bottle is huge! Seriously, when you only use about a quarter size amount--This is going to take a while to plow through--for the price that's awesome.2)My skin feels so refreshed and soft after I use it.The only con is that it's quite watery--pouring it out is a little obnoxious, but I think that can be solved by either moving it to a smaller travel bottle."
5,Entrances the Little Ones,I teach two classes of 3/4 year olds and 4/5 year olds. Both groups liked this book and listened intently. It's great to have a book about trucks for a change of pace too. The illustrations are beautiful. A five and a half year old girl wondered aloud how a boy could drive a truck.
5,A forgotten masterpiece,"In which Christopher Morley adapts the Troilus and Cressida story of Chaucher and Shakespeare for the Twentieth Century American Public. It's like a musical comedy.This little gem has it all. Drama, satire of war, politics and the media, touching love passions, humour and terror. It's also very funny."
1,"Nasty to Drink, I'd rather take a pill!","This stuff is supposed to be mixed with water or juice. I tried both and both were disgusting. It makes the juice very thick and it hard to mix in and dissolve, it clumps up. It makes the juice taste nasty even though it claims to be ""tasteless"". I personally would prefer to pop a pill than drink this slop. yuck."
1,Finger Nail Ridges and Splitting Nails,"The finger nail ridges and splitting nails are still there but I haven't finished the container of Knox. It will likely take the time to consume at least the whole container and perhaps even a second container to make a difference, if a difference can be made. I use one scoop of the Knox product in either V-8 or citrus juice each day. Sometimes I miss a day. There doesn't seem to be improvement at the base of the nail where the new growth occurs yet either."
4,WARNING !,"Be aware that plants and fruits from the nightshade variety are not good to ingest if you have arthritis. They induce swelling in the joints. These include oranges, lemons, tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, as well as tea, (other than herbal). If you are taking your NutraJoint with orange or tomato juice you are being counterproductive. You should cut out nightshade plants and get the same nutrients from dark green leafy vegetables - spinach, kale, broccoli, etc. They contain even more vitamin C than citrus fruits."
4,Within the first week I noticed a decrease in joint pain.,"I only gave the product 4 stars because I did not love the taste. But then I found that I could put it in my smoothies and that's much better. My mother is 88 years old and she has been taking Nutra-Joint for over 20 years. She rarely complains of arthritis and she has had several falls in the last 10 years and has not broken any bones! I call that a miracle. I'm 58 and already starting to feel pain in my lower back and knees so I decided to try it. After a week, I noticed less pain and I wish now that I had started taking this product years ago."
4,Truly essential,"This is a comprehensive and thorough guide to caring for, and to a lesser extent, buying, backpacking and paddling gear. There are also short sections on climbing and ski-touring gear. The authors have a distinct bias towards repairing rather than replacing gear, which leads them to give less info about what to buy than ""Rock and Ice Gear"" by Clyde Soles.The book is full of clear and useful drawings and photos. The lists of essential tool kits for different trips are invaluable.The pun-filled prose and the Getchells' earthy-crunchy, smarmy preaching quickly grow tiresome if you spend a good deal of time with the book, however."
5,quick delivery and great product,"I love it this pet crate, it is perfect for small dogs. I have a dauhsund and it is pretty tall for him. Love the low price too."
5,"Great price, good crate","This product has been great. The price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store. The only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive, it should be fine. Also, their is only one side door, doesn't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have, BUT that didn't matter in our case. This door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out. For the price, it's a great product."
4,cage review,"Terrific cage for my smaller dog. Works well, he loves it. It came within a week of my order placement, no hassles. Glad I made the purchase. My dog rates is 4 ""ARFS"""
5,The source of our faith,"A great tribute to ""The Year of the Eucharist"". Honest, simple lives that have one sustaining componant: faith in the presence of Christ."
5,Excellent reading material,This is a very inspirational book and is a great addition to my library of spiritual reading. Short stories but very meaningful.
5,This book is better than chocolate!,This book should be mandatory reading for all Catholics to remind us what a wonderful gift we have in the Eucharist! We HAVE the real presence! and we sometimes take Him for granted. This will inspire you and bring you to a deeper prayer life. After reading this you can never thank Jesus enough for what He's done for us! We are so blessed by Him!
4,"HEY NOW, GREAT sound quality!","Excellent sound quality as was recorded multi-track in 1971. Lacks expansive forays into spaceland that I would prefer to have more of, but good versions of staples at their infancy. Band was hard and fast...shoot 'em up cowboy style in this era. Gibsons all around and tight drumming (only Billy).Excellent Good Lovin' (18+ min)and good Other One (16 min). Lots of Set one type songs as well."
4,Not quite five stars...but...,"Well this isn't a super performance from the Dead, but it has it's moments. It's incredible quality sound, and Bob Weir's playing in high in the mix, which I appreciate in the 71-74 years.Deadheads will enjoy his lead work while Jerry plays rhythm.Smokestack Lightnin and Easy Wind are great, and this from a guy who usually skips those long Pig raps.I've always enjoyed 1971 ""bar band"" dead with its one drummer, and country and blues sound, as well as some of it's best material fresh, and it's young Jerry Garcia voice. If you liked ""Ladies and Gentlemen"", you're sure to like this one. The performances aren't as legendary, not quite as many awesome tunes, but it sounds better and it's a rockin good time."
5,The best time of the Dead,I did wonder how the from the Vault series and Dicks Picks series came about and what was it about. Three from the Vault answers those questions in the written information on the CD cover. The era of the Dead from 1965 to 1980 were when the best recordings of the band were made. This CD showcases the stripped down 5 piece version that is pure rock n' roll. I loved the set list and the place and time of the recordings. Get the CD and you'll see what I mean.Great CD. Would also recommend the other two in the series.
3,"DeadHeads, listen to me!","This is a good show BUT ... the night before, 2/18/71, was by far the best night of that 6 night run.buy this one and then do yourself a favor and find a recording of the 2/18 show for one of the best shows in the Dead's career ... I was there."
5,Great little tool,"This has been very handy and usefull for many jobs other than just cutting holes in drywall. Good build, nice an sharp, fits in hand comfortably for good control and comfort. All around a great value."
2,Poor quality,I like the lightness of the bulb. But the quality of the lamp is very disappointing. It stands there in tilt and the screw is hard to adjust.
5,I Dare You to Read this One Day at a Time,"This Day in American Indian History by Phil Konstantin is a fascinating resource for everyone interested in North American Indians. I think it would be especially useful for educators who want to include American Indian History in the classroom, but fear they have neither the time nor the resources to do it. Taking five minutes to select and read one event a day the class is a good way to raise awareness, open minds, and start discussions.As the co-author of a reference book, American Indian Contributions to the World, I've learned to be very selective about the books I keep in my library. Phil has come up with an accurate and interesting volume that is filled with teachable moments. I couldn't put it down. This one is definitely a keeper."
3,book,This arrived a bit later than I usually get them but within the projected time frame. It was not what I thought it was. I thought it would be full of text but instead it is a chronology of events in short form. Oh well.
3,all too short but interesting if you are a fan of Mr Hauer,"I mostly wanted to write this review to let folks know that this is a fairly slight program weighing in at just around 25 minutes. The time makes me think it was a half hour presentation for television. It has a ""local"" or ""Cable access"" feel to the production values or lack of same...so I would recommend to Rutger Hauer fans who would like to see an interview even a short one. He was promoting his book at the time."
4,Braindead youth revived as venegence seeking 'zombie'.,"A young boy is saved from life ending brain damage when a local doctor's miraculous new technique of energizing dead brain tissue with computer chips brings him back, albeit as an emotionless and quite homicidal super genius.With its spooky combination of science and the supernatural, it was easy for me to gulp this frothy yet suspenseful and frightening tale down in a single warm, summer afternoon, in no less than four hours. Once again Saul delivers a unique psychological thriller to enthrall his numerous fans. Recommended."
3,Thanks a lot guys.,"I just wanted to say that I was in the middle of reading this book, and I just wanted to see if people liked it. And you guys totally ruined the book for me be giving the story away. I tried not to read anything spoiler-like, but I guess it was unavoidable. In the future, try not to give away the ending in reviews for people like me who are in the middle!"
4,PASS--EASY--BAD,Blood hell! You cannot stop to read it. Pass.. I scared to sleep.Your brain is no your's.
4,good as just another attachment,"The knife doesn't look all that great in terms of quality and it isn't razor sharp right out the box. But having said that, it is not a piece of crap and it serves to make the Milwaukee manual saw handle function as a big knife. This + all the over attachments you can buy for the Milwaukee saw handle, you have no need for a separate saw of any type, chisel (or paint stripper, same thing), putty spreader, brush and of course knife. And their might be other attachments for it that i havent seen yet. Let me know cos i'll probably get them.Your in for a very light toolbox!"
5,Love it,I love that I wad able to find thid rare cd! The cd came in excellent condition with everything included as promised.I am extremely satisfied and Super happy with My purchase I will highly recomend it to anyone
3,The Sims 2 for Gamecube,"To make it short and sweet, for those of us who don't meet the requirments for the computer version of The Sims, this version (which is also on PS2) is the best one for consoles. I've played all three of the console Sim games and this (or Bustin' Out!) is my favorite. It's really solid, the worst part is not being able to have a kid. Other than that, all the regular stuff is still there (along with some neat things like learning/cooking recipes). However, the computer version is better because there is so much more. Hope you found this helpful."
5,GREAT read this review,all i have to say is. if you dident realy like the pc or mac one and hated bustin out. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!! i own bustin out and coldent beat the artist part. I COLDENT GET MY GUY IN A GOOD MOOD!! errr I WAS PULLING MY HAIR OUT. and i dident realy like the pc one i founde it kinda hard to manage alot of sims. but over all it was a good game and i still play it alot.i rented this with a bnch of my friends and LOVED IT. YOU CAN CONTROLL THEM WITH THE STICK THINGY WOW!! NO POINT CLICK STUFF. and you can MKE your own food ♥ ITS GREAT. good luck. have fun.BUY IT!!!
3,It's not that bad.,"Okay, everybody is saying it's really repetitive and there is no storyline. NOT SO TRUE. You have to find the NEW LOCATIONS. Once you get through a couple of new locations, you have to complete OTHER people's goals, and they get much harder (you find yourself playing more with the other characters than with your own, and you have to take care of like three!)! There are like 13 locations, and the locations are like levels. I've only gone up to the Biodome place, which is about half-way.I wouldn't recommend buying this game, but it IS fun to rent and it seems more fun because you haven't played it in awhile. TWO PLAYER IS AWESOME, so get a friend and play!"
3,Very Repetetive,"This game is fun.... for the first 30 minutes. Then it gets extremely repetitive. You fall in love with a girl, you clean puddles in the bathroom, you make yourself a meal... It all gets very boring, and very repetitive after a while(and I only played this game for the first time yesterday).The characters speak in gibberish, which is very annoying, and they lindsay lohan/avril lavinge/hilary duff type music(with gibberish words) on the stereo which the computer sims keep turning on. I hate that type of music. I turn it off, and they turn it on again. When you get a job, you just go to a carpool. You don't actually get to see the office or anything.From reviews of the computer version I was expecting more"
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"Sims 2 for Game Cube is flat out horrible. I love Sims 2 for the computer...I play it for hours and dissapointed when I was having trouble installing it on my laptop at college. I had game cube and so I decided to buy sims 2 version for game cube. HUGE MISTAKE. The beauty of PC Sims 2 is gone on the video game. My favorite part of PC Sims 2 is having kids and seeing how the DNA works out. IN GC Sims 2, however, there are no kids! You can't have them and therefore the DNA factor that made PC sims 2 so unique becomes moot. The game is boring, the controls are difficult to use and the graphics suck. DON'T BOTHER. BUY A COMPUTER JUST SO YOU CAN PLAY THE AMAZING SIMS 2 ON PC!"
3,It's not that great,"I purchased this game with some of my spare money and it wasn't worth the money at all.It's fun at first but it gets boring extremely quickly.The gamecube version is not as great as the PC version,which isn't fair.If you play in story mode,it is very hard to win and I eventually just give up.I don't recommend this game unless you enjoy these kind of things.It's not worth the money in my opinion."
4,Yahoo!,"I know this game is great. I asked my mom to get his for christmas, and man it was awesome! I mean, I know that you cant have kids or get pregnant, but its okay. Kids get annoying on this game anyway. BUY IT for a kid under the age of 17, anyone older than that dont even bother. I hope this was help to everyone. Like I said, buy it for a teen 11-17 yrs., old."
1,Stick with the computer version,"OK. I will be blunt. This version of Sims 2 stinks!!!! It is nothing like the pc version. I was expecting mutli-level homes & such, but no. If you are a fan of the Sims games, invest your hard earned Simoleans on the computer version of this game. If you already bought this game, I am sorry. See if you can sell it online or take it to one of those game stores that buy games back for cash or store credit. You won't get what you paid for it, but at least you'll get something."
1,Don't bother!!!,"This book was totally confusing!! I was expecting characters that were well developed, and I couldn't relate to anything in the book!! I finally skipped ahead to just find out the ending!!! A bore and a chore!!!"
2,Me Decade Pap,"I didn't finish this book because I became so tired of reading about this woman's self centered ""second chance at life"" schtick. Get a life!"
2,"Too, Too much Self","The writing stype is truly fine, and the book could have been better with an entirely different story. This story line, if we can use the term here, lacked credibility, meandered, and finally, focused altogether too much on the narrator's selfhood. With no thought of the possible and myriad consequences of her actions on other people, she goes forward with ""creating"" a really implausable life for herself. I never thought I'd ever say it, but ""Puh-leez""!"
3,"Loved the story, rolled my eyes at the flowery language","Although the concept of the story was very interesting, the fanciful descriptions and ""poetic"" language, rather than transforming me, left me bored.I fought myself to complete the story, just because I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I borrowed this book from my sister, which is fine with me, because I'm not itching to keep it in my collection."
4,A Treat For Toddlers,"""Dinner's ready, Ba,"" says George. But Ba is not ready for dinner. Author illustrator Virginia Miller wrote this when her first book about the little bear with the big name, On Your Potty, grew in popularity. She enhances her spare text with illustrations outlined in wide pencil and colored with soft, earth-toned markers. Bartholomew is now out of diapers, but does not seem to be out of his ""Terrible Two"" stage. The funniest part of this tale is not what the text says, but what Bartholomew does. Ba turns away holding his nose at his steaming bowl of - what else? - porridge. He fidgets while George eats his own meal, wistfully watching a slice of delicious honey cake disappear. As a parent of a picky eater I know this trick only works once or twice, but this story was still fun to read. If you enjoy this tale, I recommend Bartholomew Bear, a collection of five toddler tales of the same lovable bear at a great price."
5,Excellent Independent film,"This film is packed with action, comedy, everything that you can think of in a warming story. The features on the DVD are excellent, totally worth it"
4,A fun watch,This light-hearted film about good vs. evil is a well made student production with real potential in its writing and acting.
4,Wish I would have had it sooner,"This book is great for anybody planning to go into the CSD field. It gives advice for students in high school, undergraduate college, graduate school, and even Ph.D students. Very helpful information on courses to take, GPA's, requirements to be an SLP or Audiologist, different organizations to be involved with, clinical practicum and writing for clinical practicum, and even resume and interview information.I gave it four stars because it is rather expensive, but it is well worth it. The earlier you buy this in your academic career the more helpful it will be."
5,Madonna at her BEST! Back in the 80's!,"Great video. All of her early songs were great.I was suprised at the great audio and video quality of this tape. If you like Madonna's early songs you'll love this ""live"" video!"
5,Madonna at her best and great 80s fun,"This tour video always takes me back to those fun, colourful eighties years, when Madonna looked like a human being (no way was she 'chubby', she was healthy and gorgeous compared to the skeletal anorexic she is now) and made perfect pop music and brilliant music videos. If this concert video is ever published on DVD, I will most definitely buy it."
1,found it at last,"My girlfriend was looking al over foro this particular item, Madonna Live-The Virgin Tour (1985), she had recorded it when she was young but lost it over the years and was always looking at stores for it. when we found it at Amazon she couldn't be happier. It was our first purcase from the internet and we where really surprised it was delivered so fast from the states to the netherlands!! The quality was very good but the happyness over finally having found the tape and having it in possesion again was even bigger!!"
5,Great picture book!,"I purchased this book for a father's day gift and was very pleased with the beautiful photographs it contains. My parents are planning on moving to Colorado and I think this book definitely gives them something to look forward to! (The photographs are in color, as is the cover of the book - the Amazon depiction might make you think it would be a black & white photography book.)"
5,Colorado II,This is a beautiful coffee table book. The photos do justice to breath-taking Colorado. Great gift!
2,A disappointment,"I was disappointed when this book arrived. First, it was quite slow arriving, second, the dust jacket has a large logo of a hotel chain on it, so it looks like I had stolen the book from the hotel."
4,Another Nice Bracelet from CoolStyles,"This bracelet is just as comfortable as the other two web chip bracelets I bought. The quartz stones aren't shiny like the crystals, but still very nice. The color is much paler than the online photo and there are some variations in the stones from very pale yellow, almost white, to yellow. Four stars because the color is so off from the photo, but I still like it. The width varies a little, but is about 1 1/2 inches."
2,"Great, at first.","This was great at first, but the telescope features of the pole only lasted a year or so. If you look at mine now, you'll see tape all over it because it won't lock. I have used many telescoping poles for painting and such, and I have never seen one all of the sudden not work. It is inexpensive because it is cheaply made. I am currently looking for an alternative because I am not buying another one of these."
4,Extension,"This may very well save my husband form getting hurt. It was very inexpensive. The pole is great, much better than using a ladder.K. Engel"
5,Works as suggested,Both of my external hds broke. So I called the replacement plans number and within a few weeks I had a check in my mailbox. It's worth it.
1,"I cancel, they didn't","I sent an email twice to have this warranty cancelled, both times they were ignorned."
3,Warranty,"It seemed to take a long time to receive this--it arrived at least a couple of weeks after I received the email stating that it was on its way, and it wasn't until after I wrote and inquired about it."
2,came late,"This is a good service, but I depended on this company to arrive in the time specified. It was 3-5 days late, and had to be mailed separately."
1,This isn't needed on most items.,Only get this if you have 7 year old kids that break everything or want to waste money
4,"Great ""peace of mind"" for tiny price","Note: the only reason I gave them 4 not 5 stars is that they don't offer an emailed policy.Yes you pay a little, and the paperwork take the snail mail route to you but hey this coverage only kicks in AFTER the original warranty; so there is no rush... If it stops working they issue you a refund for the purchase price + tax, so you can purchase your own replacement.Just as a check, I called the 800 number and got a real helpful person right away... no problem!SWEET"
4,Good for some...,"While I'm generally opposed to most kinds of insurance, I recognize it is good for some. I purchased two plans for electronic gifts for family members who I didn't think were the most responsible. I ended up returning one of the gifts, and I had no trouble returning this plan alongside it. They were also helpful in clarifying which warranty plan was for which item, as the two gifts were not identical. I have not ever had to activate the plan, but dealing with customer service was easy and pain free."
5,Excellent customer service,"I had purchased this coverage for a portable DVD player that my kids use. After about 15 months, the hinge on the cover was broken and it wouldn't stay up (not sure whether normal wear & tear or if they dropped it). Anyway, I called NEW since I had the 2 year warranty. They were great and immediately e-mailed me a UPS shipping label. I sent the player back and I received the e-mail credit (you can get a check which takes longer or an immediate Amazon credit)immediately. I was able to use the credit and buy another DVD player and warranty. NEW even called me to follow-up to make sure I received my credit ok. I would highly recommend them."
4,Great Restoration for Movie and Lit Fans,"This is a treasure for fans of old movies. The story itself is a bit macabre, but it the restored DVD provides a glimpse of how Hollywood tried to push the envelope before the days when the production code was in full force."
3,The Most Dangerous Game,Great Movie for its time. Fay Wray is gorgeous in this movie. Good collectors item. That said the movie wasn't a true horror film.
3,EARLY B HORROR FLICK,"The DVD of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932) is worth seeing for four reasons. The first reason is that it is the precursor to ""King Kong"" made at the same studio at the same time. The second is to see how a good story can be told with lean economy within a 60 minute running time. The third is to see how much more cinematic and fluid the camera work is compared to both Universal's ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"", each made only one year earlier. The fourth is the wonderful print which belies the film's age.I can't wait for Criterion to release ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"" on DVD, both of which are long overdue."
3,Steaming Video Review,Remake of an earlier movie based on a short story I'd read. The movie was similar to the book but did not follow exactly.
4,"Movie version of ""The Most Dangerous Game""","I liked this version because it gave my students an idea of what movies were like ""back in the day"". We read the story and I was using this as a compare/contrast opportunity because the movie is very different from the story. I had a VHS copy that I made from the T.V., so seeing it in color and through Amazon was much better in quality."
2,Ouch!,"People who remember reading ""The Most Dangerous Game"" in freshman English class will undoubtedly be intrigued by this title. If you're looking for a faithful retelling of the story, look away, please. The story has been altered to include a love story and remove the questions raised by Rainsford's choice to continue to play the game after Zaroff has given Rainsford the victory. If you're looking for a good teaching tool to use as a contrast to the short story, on the other hand, you're in luck. Fans of the short story will have a lot to talk about after watching this movie.Have fun."
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","This is a great movie, filmed with the stars of King Kong (1933) using the same sets. Good eerie stuff. However, this re-do has failed me on 2 out of 2 purchases due to a bad DVD. The first purchase: the DVD pixillated and froze constantly. Tossed it out. The second purchase: the DVD ran OK but had a loud and annoying 'grinding' sound over the soundtrack. I thought it might be the DVD player going out, so I tried the disc on different DVD player . . . same problem. Tossed it out. Darn! So my rating is 5 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the DVD."
4,Classic,"I got this to show my class after reading the story. It was fun because the students could find superficial similarities and differences, as well as thematic similarities and differences. I'll definitely use it in the future."
2,What's with all the digital artifacts?,"This is a very fun (and somewhat campy) thriller with lots of impressive sets (later used in King Kong).....so why is the Criterion DVD littered with so many compression artifacts? There is so much shifting going on in the image (pieces of the background are always moving, castle doors shift as the arch stays still, trees and hills jitter back and forth whereas the rest of the image is stable)--- for a company so widely revered for ""restoring"" films, it is a shame that Criterion is using substandard digital mastering for some of their DVDs. Their laserdisc of this title did not have all this artifacting. Yes, the image itself is sharp and clean and looks better than the old public domain videos, but that just makes it even more frustrating that the mastering is so haphazard. It's hard to admire the sets and design when they're moving all over the place like a mosaic painting. I would have given this movie a 4 star rating...the DVD brings it down to a 2."
4,Department of Morbid Details,"Apparently a favorite of the never-captured Zodiac Killer, who wore a costume based on the hunter's outfit in this film."
3,"Nice movie, acting so-so","Quite a few years I watched ""The most dangerous game"" on tv. As I remembered it, I liked the movie a lot. So when I found out about this DVD-release I decided to buy it.On the DVD are the original b/w version and a colorized version. Why, I ask, because which movie fan wants to watch a b/w movie that is colorized? I started watching the colorized version, just to see how it was done, but after several minutes I decided to switch to the original b/w. The colors are too artificial.The movie's got a good story, but except for Joel McCrea, the acting is not very strong. Fay Wray only seems to be able to scream in this movie.Perhaps not the best movie ever made, but I guess it is a movie that fans of classic movies should watch at least once."
5,CRITERION RELEASE!!!!!,Criterion's release is easily the best available. The excellent print and the extra commentary make this the only version recommendable. Please stay away from the colorized garbage.
1,save your money,"wow...i read a lot of good reviews about this movie and after viewing it for myself i was left wondering...what the hell was it people were smoking and or drinking! wtf! this movie sucked a big one! omg! poor acting,shit plot! save your money!!!!!!!!!"
2,The Most Dangerous Game VCR,I would have like to have known how old the edition was. It was fairly poor quality and won't last for many viewings. I purchased it for classroom use and sadly will not be able to use it as much as I had planned.
1,Legend has no clue...,"or respect for movies. They sure do think DVD buyers are a bunch of saps, though, who will pay good money for a ""restored"" film that isn't restored, but IS colorized. The Criterion DVD version is great, the Alpha version is cheap but very good, and this one contains... a version that is Crayola-ized for those few folks who think it's interesting to see a film that was made in color (with B&W cinematography) turned into some sort of paint-by-numbers project. Pathetic."
5,A Favorite of 4th Graders!,"I'm a fourth grade teacher who read this book -and the two following volumes- to my class and it was a tremendous hit (at the end of the year, kids actually bought their own copies and asked me to ""autograph"" them! ) I would recommend thiese books to anyone looking for a fun book for a 9 or 10 year old - the writing is very good, the illustrations are fun, and the books are filled with action and suspense - great for reluctant readers ~"
5,A Great Book :),I have loved Akiko since I started it last year. I think it is a great book for all ages. Even if you dislike reading you should still read it. Another reason I like it is because it is a out a girl my age.
4,A fun series of books,"We came across these books by accident, but what a nice surprise. Sure, it's not great literature, but my first grader thinks it's so much fun! There are exciting adventures, but not too scary. There are funny names for characters, planets, and things that tickle his funny bone. Eventhough I have a boy, I like it that there is a girl hero. Also, I like that the girl is a first generation Japanese, because we get to talk about how immigrants are really just like us. All the books in this series are silly and fun, but they'll get your kids to read!"
4,A Great Book to Read Aloud,"My 5 year old daughter and I love to read these books together. The chapters are short, the story is silly fun, and it's quite easy to get into character (if you want to add that element of different voices to your story). All in all we're both happily hooked on Akiko!"
5,A personal comment about its length,I had the good fortune to be at the performance at Boston Symphony Hall in November 2005 when this CD was recorded. The emotional effect was so intense for both my wife and myself that we did not stay for the rest of the concert--a Mahler symphony no less. Any coupling of this Cd with another work would distract from its emotional effect.
5,Elegance and heart,"It is no wonder that this recording received the Grammy award. The artist has such elegant phrasing and vocal beauty that it is not necessary to understand the Spanish language.The language, however, has been well-served by Mr. Lieberson. He fits the poems and his compositions together with great care. We ""see"" some of the images of the poetry as we hear the music."
5,Super!,I gave this as a gift and the recipient absolutely loved it. And.......thanks for the early delivery
2,Lorraine Hunt Lieberson Sings Peter Lieberson: Naruda,"Great voice, totally uninteresting music. For me, not accessible. Not lyrical enough. Almost funereal. My musical 'horizons' apparently are not broad enough for this one."
3,Feel cheated by the length,"Beautiful singing; I haven't listened to it enough to be able to really rate the CD accurately on artistic content.However, I can't seem to get over the fact that this song cycle only lasts 31 minutes......they could easily have added more content to fill out the program. If I had known beforehand how slight the recital would be, I probably would have waited to purchase this CD later, cheaper, used. Marketers will do anything to make a buck, and I wish hadn't been sucked in by their tactics."
2,A loss to music,"I had only heard a little of Lorraine Hunt Leiberson. I thought that this was a special person, a contributor to civilized perception. Then I heard she was no longer with us. I feel this as a significant loss to myself and to our society. I'll continue to listen to her recordings, and to mourn her passing. I hope to continue to learn from her."
2,Terrible,"The tracklisting for this CD single is horrible. It only includes two tracks. The album version is good, but the remix is mediocre at best. Not good enough, and not enough tracks. Awful.Tracklisting:-01 Do Somethin'02 Do Somethin' - DJ Monk Radio Edit"
5,Excellent auto car cover at a good price!,"I bought the Covercraft C35004RB auto cover for my newly purchased Nissan Altima. I was hesitant about this purchase after seeing what higher end covers cost in fear it would be junk. I'm happy to say that it is an excellent, low price cover which does the job. When taking it out of the box, I thought it would be difficult to put on but after getting the hang of it, it went on easily. I'm sure my next attempt at covering my car will take a couple of minutes at most. Though I haven't tested it in a New Englnad winter, it looks like it would hold up well. One recommendation however is to use the cord that comes with it that will tie the sides down. During a recent windy storm, I did not do this and found my cover on the ground. Still excellent for the price and it looks good too! Very pleased."
1,cover for car,I bought a car cover and it's already riped in the front at the seam. No I am not satified with this product. All I did was pull the front dow tight ad boom the fabric ripped at he seam.
5,Fun and refreshing...,"The Secret of the Scroll contains the high level of political deniability inherent in the espianage novel, causing the hero to rely on something other than the might and right of countries. Going it alone, Greg McKenzie picks up an intrigueing entourage of sidekicks as he races through the tale. The refreshing part is that the hero isn't exceptionally gifted with super powers of observation, incredible martial art skills, or packing tons of hardware. It is a story of man's greed affecting the innocent, resolved by a lifetime of experience,and fueled by a determination born of love. While the twists and turns are intricate, it is all told with a smooth grace that never pulls the reader out of the fantasy. I have found a new author whose next work I'll anticipate from the time I close the cover."
5,Meet the McKenzies,"The McKenzies are a wonderfully normal, middle-aged couple who could be your next-door neighbors, except they have adventures we only read about. In this first novel of their series, the reader is treated to a backdrop of ancient history and international intrigue for a chase fueled by a man's love for his wife. I really enjoy that Greg is not a super hero. He has problems with his hometown police, becomes a suspect in his wife's disappearance and keeps going. You will too, once you begin reading. Cleanly written and exciting."
5,A monumental recording,"This account of ""The Tempest"" will become a classic. Red-hot, full of passion brings out the atmosphere of the Shakespearian drama. Osmo Vanska with the Lahti SO at top form make an exceptional account of the much neglected masterpiece. I am not sure I can judge the singing since my Finnish are non existent but my ears didn't hurt. Along with Jarvi's account of the Symphonies probably the best digital Sibelius you'll find out there."
1,back to history class,"An archetypal heroine cannot save this dreary re-cycled Bonds plot line from becoming an excercise in tedium. The historical refences appear to have been mis-copied from three-by-five note cards. And while Bonds has no mandate to be historically accurate, some of the references are so far removed from historical fact the overall effect becomes comic. One would hope Ms. Bonds would conduct a more thorough reading of factually sound non-fiction before she attempts a project of this kind."
4,Day by Day Account from Expulsion of Nauvoo . . .,. . . inspirational account from a number of early Mormon pioneer journals and other historical souces. Well worth the price. Can be read on a day-by-day basis to gain appreciation of the great sacrafices made for religious freedom in America.
4,Pelikan Review,I like the pencil. I ordered a .7 mm Pelikan pencil and was shipped a .5 mm Pelikan pencil. I told the company I ordered from so they contacted the manufacturer. The lady with the manufacturer said there was no way I could have been shipped a .5 mm Pelikan pencil. The company I ordered from requested a .7 mm insert from the manufacturer which was sent to the company and then forwarded to me. The company I ordered the .7 mm Pelikan was very helpful and I applaud their effort. The manufacturer was rude and I have yet to receive an apology. I will think twice about ordering their product in the future!John
2,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!,"I FIND THIS CD TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! TERRY, YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH XYZ. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW, FLYNN'S REAL NAME IS ""TERRY ILOUS"" THE FAMOUS SINGER FROM THE HAIR BAND XYZ AND ALSO EX-FRONTMAN FOR THE BAND CAGE. I AM A HUGE XYZ FAN AND NOT ONLY IS THE MUSIC FROM TERRY'S NEW RELEASE DISAPPOINTING BUT THE FACT THAT HE MAKES NO REFERENCE TO HIS ROOTS IN XYZ ON HIS WEBPAGE IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE METAL FANS AND DON DOKKEN WHO GOT HIM WHERE HE IS TODAY. TERRY I THINK YOU CAN DO A LOT BETTER. IF YOUR AN XYZ FAN DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!!!!! TWO STARS IS BEIN' GENEROUS."
4,Learning Tibetan from the ground up.,"Although I agree with the other reviewers that the repetition is sometimes enough to drive you to tears, it certainly drills basic sentence structures and words deep into your brain. You have to be creative to maintain interest by listening to the tapes without the book, reading the book without the tapes, listening to the tapes while you are folding the washing! It works! Since this course takes a few months to complete, I would not recommend it to someone who wants to pick up tourist phrases: there are other books available which are more focussed. But, if this is your starting point for learning spoken Tibetan for some other purpose, start here. There's almost nothing else available anyway."
4,Yogurt Maker,"We've used this product once, the directions were a bit hard to follow but we figured it out. We will be making our own yogurt from here on out. Once we get more familiar with the product, I assume it will be easier to mix."
1,Plastic not glass not best for yogurt in general,"I didn't realize that this yogurt maker had plastic (not BPA free plastic) jars instead of glass. Heating anything in plastic is a no-no so I'm very disappointed that the jars are plastic. Also, no small mason jars can be substituted because they use their own proprietary-sized jars. I would skip this yogurt maker and find one that uses glass and that can accept other glass jars."
4,No Problem With the Unit...,"I have NO problem with the unit - it works great. The recipes leave A LOT to be desired! NO WAY does the included directions make 8- 6oz containers. 5 yes, 8 not a chance. I am on the hunt for better proportions for this unit. There's another recipe on this review that doesn't make 8- 6oz either. Believe me, I measure EVERYTHING."
4,Great yogurt maker,"I bought this machine after reading ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" - and decided that I wanted a yogurt that I knew was organic and pure. So far I am VERY pleased with the results, although I am still experimenting with the right mix of milk, ppowdered milk, starter and cook time. The only thing I would change on the unit is the lids for the cups. As another reviewer mentioned...it is VERY difficult to remove the lids from the containers. Screw-type lids might have been easier. Aside from that, everything works great!"
4,Good taste for the plain yogurt,The first time I got this product I felt a little bit expensive because the similar product only cost $30. Then I made the yogurt with 8hr and it failed. I was a little bit upset but finally I succeed after following the protocol online. It is a pretty good stuff and the taste of the yogurt is good. The reason I only give it four star is because the plastic jar is easy to deform under high temperature even in hot water. Enjoy it!
2,faulty product,"I have been loving this yogurt maker until today when it ceased to function. I can not get it to work. I put in the 10 1/2 hours for my setting, push Start and it zeros itself. Unplugged and replugged, pushed reset...still, no luck. It was good while it lasted; made good yogurt and 8 cups at a time. But I have only had it for six months and it quit working. Not so good."
1,Disappointed,"Well, I was very excited to get my yogurt maker in the mail a few days ago. Set out to make my first batch today. Got the liquid all heated and prepared. Poured it into the cups... the HOUR button does NOT work! I don't want to just throw out the whole batch, so I guess I will spend the day resetting the minute button every hour and then sending it back. Unable to find any help online or in the manual. Will send it back and purchase something else.Follow-up: I sent the machine back and Amazon very quickly sent a new one. Service was great, and this one worked fine. I would still only give it about 3 stars though... the instruction manual is not very good, and it's a bit of a pain to clean those jars and get the lids on. Otherwise, my yogurt came out ok - I followed the instructions accurately. On a personal note, it's a lot of work for that small amount of yogurt, and I will probably not use it very often."
1,Original and Replacement Both Defective,"I ordered this yogurt maker based on the positive reviews written about this product. When I received mine, the Minute and Hour Set Buttons would not work. So I requested a replacement. I received the replacement in 2 days, I was planning to use the box of the replacement to send the original back. Well, the Replacement was defective also. The Minute Set Button worked fine, but the Hour Set Button, did not work correctly, sometimes it would work when pressed, but mostly didn't work when pressed.I would have to press it 5 or 6 times to get it to set 1 hour. I figured this would probably break sooner than later. So now I have two yogurt makers to send back. This is an inferior product as far as I am concerned and feel Amazon should review whether it should continue to be sold on the site. I am giving this product 1 star, it deserves zero stars since I never got to use it. I am disappointed."
2,Poor quality machine,"I purchased this machine and made great yogurt for about a year. Then, the outer wells stopped producing yogurt and instead gave me warm milk. Finally, the inner four wells stopped working. I checked several times in the middle of a heating cycle and all of the wells are stone cold.It started off great, but at $45-60, this machine should last longer than a year. I'll be looking for another brand."
4,good but design needs improvement,"the yoghurt maker works very well but the cups are to high and narrow not easy to clean. Would be better if the inner bottom would be round and the cups are wider, otherwsise I am very satisfied with the result"
2,want to love it,"I want to love this yogurt maker but so far my first two batches are a bust! I'm following the instructions but getting nowhere. It seems from the reviews that I'm the only one who can't figure it out. 1 qt organic milk, heated until the milk steams and bubbles. Cool it to the right temperature. Mix a heaping TBL of commercial yogurt (I've been using Fage Greek) with some of the milk, then mix back in with all the milk. Load up jars and wait 10 hours (with machine on) and Voila! I have a milk that tastes like yogurt. Any suggestions from happy users?"
2,Donvier Yogurt Maker,"I received the item and wanted to use it the same day. However, the thermometer cracked as soon as I placed it in the pot that had milk in it. And, no, the milk was not hot.Would it be possible to have a replacement thermometer?"
1,the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon.com,"This product stopped working immediately - the electrical system shut down on my first yogurt-making attempt. Contacting the company did no good. They just said to work through Amazon. It appears, however, that I cannot get the product replaced by working through Amazon, because it was purchased through a merchant-seller on Amazon. I have contacted the merchant to advise of the initial problems. If they make this right, I may amend my review."
2,Don't waste your money,"After having made my own yogurt with a different brand of yogurt maker for over twenty years, I knew what I hoped for in a new yogurt maker. This one looked good, but didn't last for even a year. The first difficulty was the jars included with the maker appeared to be polycarbonate, which contains Bisphenol A, and were unacceptable. I had to find glass jars that could be used instead. The electronic timer became intermittent after about 6 months and stopped working completely soon after that. I sent e-mails and wrote to the company about the problems and they never responded. Don't waste your money."
3,Plastic Jars,"I was all set to purchase this yogurt maker, as I liked the other reviews and found the shape better for my limited counter space (it's rectangular instead of round)...but then I noticed it comes with polycarbonate jars. Thanks but no - as soon as they get with the times and include glass jars (or at least an option to purchase glass jars separately), I'll be happy to buy one but until then, I'm back to checking out the other brands, most of which do include glass jars.Cuisipro Donvier Electronic Yogurt Maker"
1,Not warm enough,"Although this product looks nice, the one that I got is not working, for both timer and heat system. I am very disappointed with it!"
1,Donvier bites the dust,"I made yogurt for years, including four years in Africa without any appliances at all, except a tea kettle. And then I used a simple appliance all during the eighties, nineties, and the first part of the 00s. When that finally wore out, I purchased a Donvier. I was never able to achieve consistent results, even using a thermometer (rather than dunking my finger in, but that didn't work either). Most of the time, my batches didn't solidify, so I finally gave up. I really think that the incubation temperature was not hot enough. I do miss home-made yogurt; the commercial product is never as sweet, smooth, and creamy."
1,Why buy a machine?,"I have been making my own yogurt for the last 20 years. All you need to do is to boil milk, let it cool down to about body temperature, mix in 4-5 spoons of yogurt, wrap up the pot in a blanket to keep it warm, and let it wait for 6-8 hours in a corner at your home. Unwrap and refrigerate. No need for a machine."
1,Crummy machine,"My wife got this machine as a gift. The first time it failed, we thought it was because we somehow hadn't followed the complex instructions. The second time it failed, it was clear the unit was to blame. Thank goodness we didn't pay our own money for this worthless product. Our advice: buy some other brand. Any other."
1,pb soy yogurts,I miss soy yogurts !!! I've been used to make soy yogurts in France. I've bought this yogurt maker. I've tried several times to make some but it never worked. I've followed the recipe using plain soy milk and one plain yogurt. Has anyone got a recipe for me ? I'm allergic to lactose...Thank you.
3,It makes yogurt.,"It works, but I cannot understand why one should go to all this trouble when ready made yogurt is cheap, tasty, and you don't have to wash the cups. I found the homemade was too tart and the portions are too small. If you are health concious and use organic milk you will be pleased with this unit."
2,SO SO.,The item will make you YOGURT but the time you put in making it will i thank i will be just buying mine at the store just to much truble.
2,Nice Design but Lids Difficult to Use,"I just received this unit and liked the compact design and the convenient thermometer stir utensil. Unfortunately, I found the lids to be very difficult to snap on and remove. For older people with any reduced hand strength or arthritis, I would not recommend it. I ended up returning it immediately as I saw no functional use with this lid design flaw and the pain I experienced using jars. Still searching for a suitable replacement."
1,Not reccommended,The yogurt maker arrived and the minute timer was broken on it. You could set the hour timer but not the minutes. I tried it anyway and it was a failure for my first batch. Tried a second batch and the yogurt was okay. Lots of parts to wash and clean on this unit. Too much trouble for me to use. I just make a large bowl in a warm oven now. The item was returned.
5,Donvier Electronic Ygurt Maker,Made perfect yogurt the first time. Works just as advertised and the auto-timer feature makes it a set it and forget about it appliance. The included stirrer/thermometer is an added benefit also.
4,Gets the job done!,"I have made my first batch of yogurt and the Cuisipro worked like a charm. I followed the instructions carefully, as suggested by other reviewers and other yogurt machine owners, and I can't wait to make my second batch today.I used whole milk with powdered yogurt culture, and the yogurt was ready in 10 hours. Next time I will use some existing yogurt, or try greek yogurt. For flavoring, I just use a spoonful of organic strawberry preserves and it tastes so much better than supermarket varieties!!!I will also experiment with skim milk and milk powder to see how that goes.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the jars, they really should be glass for this price! I bought it on amazon on sale, I only paid about $25 for the machine and the cultures. You can find a beautiful imported yogurt maker with glass jars for $40 at Williams-Sonoma. Otherwise, I am very happy!"
4,Yogurt maker,I liked this machine; it makes 8 containers. The only thing I don't like is that the tops are hard to get on and off.
4,Great product,It is a great product that does what it is supposed to do! Makes delicious yogurt. However the 8 little cups are a little hard to clean each time. No big problem though.
5,Love this maker!,"I've had this yogurt maker for over 5 years, but it's the past 2 years that I have really given it a workout. I make 1-2 batches a week. It's so simple, heat milk and milk powder, cool and put it in the maker. My kids love it with frozen fruit, flax seed, honey or agave syrup. I highly recommend it. I use it so often, I ordered an extra set of cups which has been very handy. I need to finally order replacement lids ($0.25 ea directly from donvier). I put the lids in the dishwasher for convenience, but it made them crack and split...I recommend handwashing them. I haven't had any problems with the jars."
3,No thermostat,"This is the only yogurt maker I've ever used, and in the 3 years I've had it, I almost always get great yogurt, but you should know that this is not temperature controlled. That means that in the summer when the temperature in the kitchen is 75 deg F or higher, the middle four cups finish hours ahead of the outer 4 cups. I also once used cold milk instead of heating it up to the proper temperature first. The yogurt took an extra 10 hours that time. I wouldn't be surprised if this is normal for most yogurt makers."
2,Unnecessary machine for a simple process...,"Like all yoghurt ""makers,"" this one aims to fill a demand in a process that does not require any such machine. A pot / jar wrapped in a blanket and placed in a warm spot (possibly the cabinet above the fridge, next to the heater, or my favorite, the warm oven after baking), a thermos-flask, or a warmed lunch box/cooler replaces this thingamajig easily.Though do buy a thermometer, as first heating the milk to ca. 176F/80C and then cooling it to ca. 113F/46C before adding the starter culture (store bought greek yoghurt/powdered culture) reduces unwanted bacterias and ensures the thermophilic yoghurt culture thrives. This is simpler, quicker, and cheaper than any of these gadgets.But as gadgets go, it has a nice laboratory look about it, evoking a modern day Louis Pasteur of the home-made kitchen yoghurts."
2,BAD CHOICE,I BOUGHT THIS YOGURT MAKER COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND I TRIED EVERYTHING FROM STARTERS (WHICH COST GREAT DEAL OF MONEY) TO STORE BOUGHT YOGURT. NOTHING WORKED YOU GET RUNNY MESS AND IF YOU DRINK IT TESTS LIKE YOGURT. NOT WORTH THE MONEY
1,Excelent Choice,"I really recommend this product. The results are great! The ""Cuisipro Dovier Electronic Yogurt Maker"" was a smart addition to my kitchen.It is easy to use, you get great results each time you use it. The best of all is that you can enjoy a good fresh yogurt free of chemicals or additives.I have to admit that I decided to get this product after reading Mirielle Guiliano's book, entitled ""French Women Don't Get Fat"". Thank you Mirielle!"
2,yogurt maker,I received this yogurt maker as a gift. I have had a few and don't find this one to be any better than the regular salton machines. The cup sizes are about 6 oz each and the lids are cheap and crack easily. I am disappointed to have traded an old salton machine that I bought at a thrift store for this fancier model. I would've been better off ordering lids from salton and keeping what i had. I do not recommend this product.
5,Colorful WWII Naval Movie poster,I like this poster of this is great submarine film set during WWII against a Nazi battleship. James Caan is good in the strong silent type lead of this secret mission. The film also has a lot to do with self-redemption and fighting overwhelming odds. Good stiff upper lip adventure. This poster is very colorful and reminds of when I first saw this movie.
4,Surprisingly good drama about redemption and guilt,"This is a low key and somewhat slow piece about a grieving man who ends up befriending a graverobber who has been exiled. It makes you wonder how much the guilty should suffer and for how long, and how a change of heart can alter a person who had been bitter and angry before. Nicely done with great locations."
5,Terrific western with a twist,"A western with more depth and feeling than many other westerns, showing how anyone can earn compassion. Authentic feel and great acting, especially from an almost unrecognizable Margot Kidder."
4,"great addition, but Sydney still better","I have to agree with the other reviewers that the Live in Sydney DVD is better. From a technical standpoint, only dolby digital 5.1 is offered and strangely defaults to stereo, while the Sydney DVD has DTS. Both are widescreen format, but the encoding is a little pixelated and the shots are sometimes out of focused in the fever DVD. The menu system is functional, but too sparse...like an old Atari text screen.The concert itself is a different experience from Sydney that has refreshing costumes and stage performances. An enthusiastic Kylie fan should pick up both DVDs, while the casual fan with more discretionary spending should pick up the Sydney DVD intead."
3,Guys in Pantyhose!,"If you like Kylie Minogue and don't mind watching a bunch of half naked guys dance around in high heels and pantyhose, this is the DVD for you. If you are like me however, and this is not really something that you want to see, I would recommend that if you get this DVD do not watch the performances of ""The Locomotion"", or ""In Your Eyes""! Besides those 2 scenes, it is a pretty good DVD, but it gets knocked 2 stars just for the gross-out factor."
3,Kylie is OK,"After seeing the Live in Sydney DVD, I thought that Live in Manchester would have as much energy. I was wrong, while this DVD is definetly not bad, its not Kylie at her best. As mentioned in the other reviews, she stands around and moves her hand most of the time. This concert almost seems like a poorly done sci-fi flick. The dancers are horrid, they all look like robots when moving.Kylie's voice is excellent like usual but if I wanted to listen to her sing, I'd just turn on the CD player, the concert is just bad. I was sadly dissappointed with the title track Fever. Unlike the Sydney dvd, the crowd is barely showed probably because no one is dancing.I'd still recommend this dvd to anyone who likes Kylie but expect a much more laid back concert, maybe its suppose to be more ""creative""."
4,KyLiE aT HeR BeST!,"When I first bought this DVD, I remember I wanted my money back! Now I know that would've been a mistake. This concert has great moments, her voice is clear and beautiful; the only thing I didn't like much was the choreography! She doesn't seem to enjoy moving a lot because it looked rather boring. The songs are also good, I love when she performs ""Love At First Sight"".Good pop music, beautiful and good singer; don't think it over much, just buy it!"
2,KYLIE at her so-so,"It appears that Ms. Minogue copied every single BAD idea Madonna and Cher ever had in concerts. I was so disappointed that Kylie RUINED so many of her classics with ""new age"" Orbitesque garbage. How could she and her dancers NOT actually dance during ""One a Night Like This""--it is not a bed tune baby....laying nearly naked on a bed with odd dancers not dancing beside her wrecked the song. ""Confide in Me"" is her best song to date, and yet she decided to place neon lights throughout the entire performance so the dramatics of the song were lost with the words 555-CONFIDE flashing non-stop...abysmal. And the costumes? She looked like she stole the clothes Madonna threw away during a Gaultier clearance sale! Buy the dvd because you are a Kylie fan, ignore it, PLEASE, if you are about to become her fan."
3,Where in the world is Kylie?,"I tried to like this concert dvd. Honest. All the ingredients are there for a great show but there is no energy present. Kylie looks lost the entire show. I have come to the conclusion that due to the popularity of Fever in the US during rehearsals for this tour that Kylie herself missed too many dress rehearsals and had little to say about the concert's overall look and finished product. It is obvious that she is uncomfortable with the choreography by the simple fact that she does not move for the entire 2 hours. She mastered one arm movement that [is overused]. She looks great as always and sounds great, but she looks so rigid and lost. Overproduction took its toll."
4,calling all kylie fans!,"I just got this DVD about a week ago and i love it.it has new songs from her album ""fever"" (can't get youout of my head etc.) as well as some old favorates(i should be so lucky, shocked etc.) you also get to see kylie""wiggle it 4 daniel and nick"". the only thing that kept mefrom giving it 5 stars was the fact that ""GBI"" was a littleweird. but anyway, if you can't get kylie out of yourhead you really should get this DVD."
3,Certainly a Mixed Bag,"Overall this is a good Hentchmen album. Great songs such as Some Other Guy,LA.M.F, Me and My Monotone, Automatic, and to a lesser extent Psycho Daisies are unfortunately overshadowed by pointless instrumentals...although Gawker Delay isn't bad. I would recommend this album to a true Hentchmen fan, otherwise just purchase the individual tracks above and pick up ""Three Times Infinity,"" ""The Hentchmen,"" and ""Form Follows Function."""
1,Brembo Rotors out of specifications,"Promptly received my order for Brembo front brake rotors. However, when they were installed it was found that they were outr of the 0.003 flatness spec. This caused a vibration problem during brakeing. Amazon sent me a replacement set no questions asked. It was noted that these rotors were Made in China. Not at the Brembo euro plant. Useually I do not buy any automotive parts from China. Amazon needs to give origin of manufacture on products like these. It is a lot of work to make the repair a second time."
3,Ink,"The price of the product is what drew me to order it. Great Value, But with low price also comes the cons. The ink cartrages dry up constantly so I have to take them out of the printer put them back in faking my printer out that I just put a new one in. The printer then cycles through a cleaning mode to get the print back flowing. I print everyday on my printer, it shouldnt dry up that fast. On the other hand how can you complain when the price was so low. 3 out of 5 just because of the inconvience."
1,Poor Product,"I replaced the Cyan cartridge and it started to bleed inside my printer, then I replaced the black cartridge. When printing it kept cleaning the printer but still printed the pages in scribble couldn't see or read what was printed. I cleaned the printer, did a alignment and cartridge color check and it printed fine but when I printed my document the color was faded and black was gray. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll just go and purchase the original cartridges which I know will work."
3,No Instructions in Package,"This is a problem, because if you don't put the cartridge in the machine, and THEN take the tape off, INK WILL SPILL all over you and your desk, etc.! There should be some instructions directing you on how to use this company's particular kind of Ink Cartridge. That would make a world of difference. As I have only used 2 out of the pack of 12, I cannot judge the entire package. When ready to order again I might write something. So far, the two I have used print fine. Keeping fingers crossed."
1,terrible,"horrible, leaked and half of them didnt work, i will be going right back to staples next time i need ink"
4,Made a mistake! This ink is terrible!,"At first, I thought this ink was great, but that was only the first cartridge. None of the other 11 cartridges would work for more than half a page without causing trouble with my printer. Switched to another off brand refill that I purchased for $9 at my printing store and had no trouble at all. You get what you pay for. Don't waste your money."
2,Reviews,I am not satisfied with this product. These ink cartridges are generic. At the time of purchase I wasn't aware of this. This is my first time ever purchashing anything from Amazon. These cartridges don't work with my Brother Mfc. 210c multipurpose machine. I was disappointed because I have enrolled in online courses and needed my printer to be able to print material. My sheets come out blank.
1,"Really bad, ink leaked and damaged my desk","Waste of money, black ink leaked, damaged my desk. Since I bought a set, I replaced again and leaked again. I bought from another non-oem and worked fine."
1,BEWARE! Terrible return policy,The coffee maker broke after 5 months of minimal use. Cusianrt has the worst return policy I have ever dealt with. Shipping both ways is the cunsumers resonsibilty and a check for $10 is required for processing. For a product that cost me $29 that is absurd. I'll never buy another product from them.
2,Don't Buy This Coffeemaker,"I have had this coffee maker for nine months. It makes good coffee but the carafe started leaking from under the rim when we poured the coffee and just kept getting worse. What a mess! I called Cuisinart Customer Service, and, after being kept on hold for about 20 minutes, was told that the carafe wasn't covered under the warranty. Needless to say, I'm very disgusted and don't recommend this coffee maker!"
4,Nice Little Coffeepot,"On the plus side it's sturdy, and the stainless steel carafe means no worries about breakage. It was also one of the very few small (4 cup) coffee pots available in white. I can't preset it with my timer to come on in the a.m., which is annoying. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase, and think it's a good value for the money."
1,Going in the trash,"Ditto to most of the reviews I have read. I wanted a nice little 4-cup coffee maker, reviews seemed adequate and it looked attractive. I CAN NOT LIVE WITH IT ANYMORE!! You cannot pour water into the machine with the carafe. You have to use something else or it pours all over the counter. Same when you pour coffee. Must be done over the sink or there's coffee all over the counter. The pause and pour works 50% of the time,therefore more coffee on the counter. The worst though is the taste. I have tried every trick in the book to get rid of the metallic,horrid taste. What is the use in drinking coffee when it tastes so horrible. It is going in the trash today and something, anything will replace it."
5,A nice small coffee maker,"I was looking for a white small coffee maker that uses cone filters. I had to decide between DeLonghi and this Cuisinart, and picked this one as this was smaller.I've read enough bad reviews about it, but I don't have any problems with spillage both pouring water into the machine or pouring coffee out of the carafe, pushing the on/off button, or metallic taste. I'm very satisfied with this product."
2,did anyone try this before putting into production?,"Virtually impossible to pour water into the coffee maker or pour a cup of coffee without a mess on the counter. ""sneak a cup"" feature worked for about 2 weeks and now leaks. When you open the lid on the coffeemaker any condensation runs down the hinge and down the back of the machine. Auto turn off works most of the time, but not always so can't depend on it. If I try to have the coffee maker set up and ready to turn on later it leaks water all over. This is the second one we've had in 5 months--both had same problems. You know you have a cheap product when the store replaces with no questions asked AND tells you not to return the old one ""just throw it away"". We're switching to another brand."
2,Looks Better Than It Is,"I purchased this coffeemaker because of the stainless steel carafe. The problem is when you pour coffee into a cup, it goes all over, I have to pour off the kitchen sink. No matter how slow or fast, it makes a mess. The second problem is when the coffee sits on the warmer, it starts to boil. This may be a problem with just this one. I would not purchase this item again."
1,barely a year and Im ready to get a new one,I have too many complaints. First its slow. Second the spout is awful. I always have a mess and I never usually have this problem.Now the heating element is wearing off. Also if you take the carafe out while the coffee is running it doesnt seem to shut off. So I have to wait for 5 minutes to make 4 cups of coffee. Dont bother. Waste of money.
2,Spillage is a major problem,"I bought the red model to save space. It makes great coffee, and very quickly. I bought a permanent coffee filter that's easy to use & clean. The major problem I've had is with spillage; the lid is very loose, and it spills water all over the counter when I'm adding it to the tank. Same problem, when I pour the coffee; half of it pours over the edge. There's problems with the brew pause feature, which doen't always work..I have to clean out that part after every use to make it work; what a hassle! I expected a lot more from a quality manufacturer! PS- Cuisinart is sending me a new lid and basket after I called and complained."
2,"Frustrated with each use, but still good coffee","The cons far outweigh the pros of this little machine.Pros:1. Good cup of coffeeCons:1. Difficult to fill reservoir without spilling2. Difficult to fill cup with coffee without spilling (carafe lid leaks)3. Difficult to fill cup with coffee without burning hand with escaping steam from carafe.4. If you lift the reservoir lid (which also holds the hot water dispenser) at the end of the cycle, water that had formed on the underside of the lid will spill back onto the boiling element and shoot steam and drops of boiling water on you hands and at your face. One learns the first time not to stand directly in front when attempting to lift lid5. Power button cannot be turned-on with one hand6. Carafe lid is sometimes difficult to snap into placeI only keep it because it is small and I'm the only coffee drinker at home. Also, I am too lazy to return it. Someday, whimsy will present a new machine to me."
4,Cuisinart 4 cup coffeemaker,"I really love this coffeemaker.Since I am the only coffee drinkerin our household, this is perfect.It makes just the right amount for one largemug or two cups and the coffee is good and hot."
2,NO!,"The Carafe is hard to get into place, and when coffee is done and you try to pull carafe out you end up yanking it and coffee, needless to say, goes everywhere. I returned mine-oh-and the carafe is not insulated."
4,FlashForward,"I started reading this novel because I saw a few episodes of the show on ABC. The story has the same main event, the flashforward, but the storyline is completely different. The story is a little slower than I would have liked at first, but picked up quickly. I truly enjoyed the theories and philosophies presented in this story. I will most definitely be reading more stories by this same author and I look forward to going back to finish the TV show."
4,Very well done,"This was a great book with a good story and a lot of ideas to think about. The basic premise took a lot of imagination to come up with: all of humanities consciousness is transported into the future for just under two minutes, giving everyone a glimpse of the future.The characters aren't the most developed you will ever read, but that isn't what this book is for. And it isn't about action either. It's about pushing through the story enough to make you think about the possibilities and properties of time in the universe.Very impressive."
3,"Great Concept, Medicore book","I have been watching the television series that is based upon this book, so I figured I would check it out. The concept is great and had a lot of potential to become something wonderful, which the television series is. This book is one of the few instances where the on-screen version is much better than the written counterpart. The series is more compelling and suspenseful, with more characters that the audience grows more attached to. The book was quite wordy at the wrong times, mostly with nonsense, and left me painfully trying to finish it. My advice would be to skip this read and just watch the series."
3,Good SciFi but it runs out of steam,"I think the opening part of the book had a lot of promise. It moved along with a lot of mystery about what caused the ""flashforward"". The science and the paradoxes of time travel were well explored, too. But there was too much focus on a few people and what this meant to them. There are hundreds of scenarios that come to mind but these were not explored. Then the book fast forwards to 2030 and then we get 3-4 pages of the end of the earth, humanity and the sun's death.I liked most of the book, but like I said, I feel the author ran out of steam and stopped challenging us (or himself) near the end."
4,"Points here mostly for the concept, not so much the execution","Every waking person on the planet falls unconscious at the same time. While unconscious, they are witness to a few moment of their lives decades in the future. How did it happen? How does it change the world? Is what they saw set in stone? And what about the people who didn't see anything?It's a man's book (you know, subtle differences in style...a bit dry) but it's SUCH a compelling idea to base a plot on it really couldn't go wrong. But yeah, a the characters and their interactions where all very secondary to the Big Idea."
3,Great Concept Poor Execution,"Great concept, but not a great execution. The characters are all unlikeable and behave in illogical manners. Worse, Sawyer has the tendency to tell, not show, and has an unfortunate taste for melodrama. He also has a strange view of what humanity will be like in 2020. Floating cars and androids. Well. We'll see. I'm still waiting on my rocket car promised to me by 1980 in old Bugs Bunny cartoons.I started the book and liked the concept (being able to sneak a peek at the future). Then I finished the book and just felt vaguely unpleasant about it afterwards.I'm reading this at the same time as Tipler's The Physics of Christianity, which turned out to be amusing, since one of the characters in the novel quotes Tipler, though not very well. Both books have a fascination with the Higgs Boson, so it was kind of interesting to read them in parallel."
1,Flashnowhere,"Another intriguing idea ruined by poor characters & bad science. It boggles my mind how this writer won a Nebula award for an even worse novel (The Terminal Experiment). Shows the state of the science fiction world, I guess. Scary."
1,Loved the story - Can't stand the writing!,"I loved the story's premise, but the book was poorly written. The characters are one dimensional and boring. A good writer like Robin Hobbs would have used a story premise like Flashforward to immerse us in the story, the character and the culture. but Sawyer seems to be writing for the dollars because the writing in Flashforward is below average. Watching the TV series got me excited about the book. Don't waste your money, the TV series is much better."
3,Mediocre for a Sawyer Book,"Sawyer is able to write in a manner that is captivating and intereting. There is rarely a dull moment in this book; moreover, the idea of viewingt he future for a brief amount of time and the issue of future immutability is one that certainly has interesting philosophical implications.With that said, it is hard to take this book a seriously as perhaps Sawyer would wish. There is little explanation for the phenomenon of the ""flahsforward"" event. Futhermore, world reaction tot he event reveals Sawyers excessively bright view of human behaviour. There would be much more than the brief anger and confusion that resulted from many people dying - there would be wars, more death and horror, not logical acceptance!In essence, this is a mystery novel; a man tries to find out who his future murderer will be, and on that level the book succeeds. It would seems that Sawyer is trying to do too much with this book and is not able to come through."
4,Better than the Series,"Rather you were a fan of the TV series or not this is a strong Sci-Fi buy. It's different from the TV series, but in mostly positive ways. The writer has done his research and for any science buff you will find it a mostly rewarding read. He does make a few stretches regarding how future technologies may work that are a bit ridiculous, but not so much they ruin the story. If you were a fan of the show this book will allow you to close that chapter of your life by answering the questions the show left open.Although some parts of the story can be a bit dull if you are expecting the action offered by the TV show they aren't too bad. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the opinions offered by the various character's on rather or not we live in a predetermined universe and how their view of the their future affects them.I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys concepts involving time travel, quantum physics and fate."
4,Decent sci-fi read. Better than TV show,"I watched the first episode of this TV show and saw it was based on this book so... The book was quite a bit different from the show, but i thought it was better. Got more into the science and philosophy of what happened, whereas the show, so far, has focused more on the individual people and their relationships. My only gripe with the book was that you know what caused the flash forward almost from the beginning. Overall a very good read though."
3,Clearly an interesting concept which Robert fails to truely engage with.,"The concept sustained me through the book but unfortunately Robert on too many occasions leads his characters to behave oddly which breaks the illusion too often. A moment of the future is given to all of humanity due to an experiment undertaken with CERNs LHC. The book explores the impact of this event on those scientists that undertook the experiment and spends far too much time in ""who did it"" territory when one of the scientists discovers that in the future he will be shot. On the whole an intersting read but seriously undermined by odd plot choices amd charecters acting out of character !"
5,Best new time-oriented novel since Baxter's Timeships,"It's hard to come up with a new riff on time travel I guess because so few writers manage it. Last one I enjoyed was Stephen Baxter's The Time Ships, but this one although completely different is equally good. And seeing as how it is set at CERN, in my part of the world, I was doubly pleased but I suspect you will enjoy it no matter where you live."
3,"Intriguing ideas, unlikeable characters","The action in this book starts fast; in fact, the main idea of the story occurs on page 5. The appealing part of the novel is the philosophical consequences of people seeing three minutes of their life 20 years in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed the 'news items' at the beginnings of the chapters.My problem with the novel is that most of the main characters are either unlikeable or unremarkable. I especially found the Theo character loathesome; I was rooting for the villain to kill him at the end. The main character was harmless enough, but his finance was annoying. The only intriguing character was the 'geeky' scientist who courts the woman who he saw in his vision of the future (making love in their lab, no less).The dialogue in this book was somewhat stilted, but it didn't bother me as much as the characters."
5,fantasy reader meets sci fi,"This book was excellent! I don't normally buy sci-fi. I am strictly a sword and sorcery type of girl. But this book was given to me by a well meaning friend and I wasn't disappointed. The science lost me once and a while, but really the story line kept me interested. I would suggest this book to anyone sci-fi lover or not. I think that the author took some huge leaps with the science, but over all I think that was to be expected with this tpye of story. I enjoied the characters as well. Again I say that this was a book well worth reading."
5,Characters always come alive for Robert Sawyer.,"This book is not just about the human consciousness leaping 21 years into the future. It's about the people to whom this happened. How do people who have been given a taste of their own future react to that knowledge? Humanity just had the ""Fruit of Knowledge"" thrust down its throat. Can we be the same after we gain that knowledge? Did that knowledge come at too high a price? Does freewill exist or is it just an illusion humanity concocted? Is the future immutable or can we make our own future? Sawyer deals with not only complex ideas, like these, but also complex emotions. He breathes life into his characters, then lets them take flight. Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down."
3,I watched the t.v. show first,"The writing was good, a bit labored. The premise of the book though similar was markedly different than the show. The show flashed forward about six months at a time, the book about 30 years. Even so, very good concept. The whole second flash forward seemed a bit of a let down with no real need for it. Wow, we evolve into star light and the universe, what a completely overused concept."
3,Sci Fi,I expected this to be more like the tv show (not sure if that would be good or bad!)The book was a little over-the-top sci fi for me. Too much scientific detail.
3,None,Like others have said this is very different from the t.v. series.This has a lot more science in it. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I tried the sample first and it seemed pretty good. In the end too little plot and character development and too much science.
3,I preferred the TV show,"I purchased the book, to see if i can get some inside on the tv showThere are a lot of common facts but i think that there is a lot of detail and less action.PS: The book was in a good condition."
2,TV show was much better,"Was a boring read after watching the short lived tv series. When the book finally reaches the ending, you can't believe that's all he could come up with."
2,Meh,"This may be the only time I ever say this: ""The TV show is better."" I've thoroughly enjoyed two other books of Sawyer's (""Rollback"" and ""Calculating God""), but this outing earns a solid, ""Meh."" The concept is brilliant, the execution weak."
2,Not well done at all,"A good idea, but handled wrong. Much of it isn't very believable, and I've read some pretty far-out stuff that was made believable by skilled authors. The characters are definitely cardboard cutouts, as many other reviewers have stated. I'm not even sure the author had a clear idea who they were. (You get the idea that Lloyd Simcoe is generally reserved/timid in the beginning of the book, but then later on he walks out on a press conference, unflustered, saying something like, ""That's it. I'm outta here."" I think I laughed out loud at that.) The dialogue is just sad, and there's very little action. The writing is pretty terrible too, with cliches littered here and there---and a decent editor was certainly called for.I thought the concept was good. But, as I said, the execution was poor. I would have liked to have seen how everyday citizens reacted to their future visions, and how they tried to change them or help them come to fruition. Less pseudoscience, more fiction."
3,nothing like the TV series,"Having watched the Flash Forward series, and being left hanging by its untimely demise; I thought that I would read the book to find out the ""end game"". No dice. The book is so different from the TV series and vice versa, as to be almost unrecognizable! Except for the basic idea of the flash forward itself, there is little in common with the two. Only 2 of the characters are the same, Lloyd Simco is the lead , there is no FBI, no hospital... etc. Quite frankly... I preferred the TV series to the book. More complex with a double touch of conspiracy."
5,Great Book,Heard about this book on a Lost forum and was interested so I looked it up and ordered it. I finished the book in only a couple of days. Once I started reading I didn't want to stop. I also let my brother borrow the book when I was done and he read it within a couple days as well. Highly recommended.
4,cool read,cool read. I just wish ABC hadn't canceled the show. fascinating concept especially if you're big on physics combined w/ some interesting side bar stories.
2,Your flashforward? Not buying the book.,"The story starts off strong, mainly because of the premise only, but the author EPICALLY FAILS at delivering a coherent end to this story. Reading the book felt like reading the writing of a sane person slowly devolving into insanity (or doing some crazy drugs) whilst writing the book. Seriously. The latter half of the book is awful. You're better off taking the idea (everyone in the world blacks out and sees a vision of the future) and using your imagination. Trust me, it'll be a better story."
1,Avoid,"I'll be brief:This is the first Robert J. Sawyer book I've read. Very disappointing. The prose was turgid and dull, bloated and repetitive. (The dialogue reads at times like a transcription of boring conversation.) The characters, cardboard. (They're both inconsistent and unbelievable.) The editing, practically non-existent. (Typos galore, but also changing pronouns, misspelled words.) The plot, unconvincing. (And ultimately unexciting. In the end he tries to play a game similar to Greg Bear's Blood Music. It doesn't work.) The science, uninspiring. (He name-drops scientists, other science fiction writers, and other science fiction writers' ideas.)I came to the book really wanting to like it. I left the book feeling like I'd wasted my time.I don't think I'll be venturing Sawyer's way again, unfortunately."
2,"Forget the book, watch the TV Series","Amazingly, the television series created from this book is infinitely better. The idea of a flashforward is intriguing, but the long winded technical explainations from Sawyer and the persistent whinging from his characters suck the life out of the book.On the other hand, the TV Series shortened the timeline to six months jump forward (much more interesting than 20 years), added mystery and suspense with a nefarious group behind the event, and abandoned the whinging characters for more likeable folk."
2,Yeah it sucked,"I didn't hate it.... but I surely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.The author put a kid in the book (7 year old) now I have no problem with kids in my book, if they act like kids. The author had this kid saying ridicules things that a 7 year old would never say.Also he tried way to hard for a love story that FAILED miserably. When two characters in the story touched hands (guy and girl mind you) he actually describe the seconds their hands were touching as delicious .... PUKE!I give it two stars because he got right to the flash-forward.I really hope the TV show is better than this book."
4,A Fresh Concept Excellently Executed,"I'd like to add my own two-cents to the very positive reviews of FLASHFORWARD. Science fiction has been undergoing a crisis in imagination even while its writers are getting better at their prose styles. Mr. Sawyer has produced in FLASHFORWARD an delightfully original concept and a gathering of characters, flawed though they are, and we watch them as their lives are changed by a glimpse they receive of the future. Sawyer has restored my faith that Campbellian science fiction can still be written with panache and verve. FLASHFORWARD is a delightful book that surprised me almost with every turn of the page. I very much recommend this book to you."
3,Meh.,"I hate to say this - because I know I'll catch a lot of flak for it, but - this is one case where the TV series really is better than the book.This is not to say that the book is bad. It's sorta average, a quick read with a lot of physics made very easily understandable by the layman, which is a feat in and of itself. (Although, I'll admit that I read some of the more interesting bits of physics to my physics-obsessed boyfriend and was rewarded with a rant of epic proportions about how it was all fuzzed. And honestly, a lot of it was.)The climax itself was the biggest anti-climax I've ever read. Well, maybe not the biggest, but the book just took every bit of suspense available and just flattened it.This is not to say that the book is awful. It's just.. well, I've never really read a book that I can characterize more as ""meh"" than this book.So, in summation, if you're curious where the series came from, go ahead and read it. It's fast. Just ...get it from the library or something."
3,"Well-written, for sci-fi","Intriguing premise, and reasonably successful execution. It's also fun to compare and contrast with the screenplays for the current tv series with the same title. Specifically, the book envisions a relatively distant ""flashforward,"" while the tv scripts employ are much closer date. The human impacts of the two alternatives are both similar and interestingly different."
4,Scientific Lead but Psychological Exploration,"Very thought-provoking and intriguing intellectually, but there is not a driving pace to this. The science fiction aspect is the actual ""flashforward"": a view that the world gets of its own future twenty years in advance due to a science experiment gone awry under very particular circumstances. Of course, once the rats realize that they are in a maze, things happen... I really liked this book, but even though it has ""hard"" sci-fi at its heart, the author spends much of the story exploring individual reactions to the ""flash"" and how they live their lives after the fateful glimpse. This is a very engaging premise but is not for riveting action sequence-lovers."
4,"Good solid read - dense, but light (?)","I read this on a camping trip, and polished it off in the space of a day. It's since become one of my frequent re-reads. It's a good book, with a really great hook for the story. Sawyer does have a bad tendency to suddenly drop in a couple of pages at a time of expository physics lecture, but (strangely) they don't _seem_ intrusive when they appear. Overall, worth buying for a compelling read."
3,Big Time Flaw (SPOILERS),"I agree with many of the reviewers who liked the idea but found the execution of the story wanting. Also, I found a big flaw in the whole ""is the future immutable or not"" question.SPOILERS FOLLOWOne of the big questions in the story is whether the future envisioned can be changed. It takes a hugely coincidental event (Theo's brother's suicide) to demonstrate that it can be. BUT, millions of people were killed during the two minutes when everyone went unconscious. Certainly most of those people would still have been alive 20 years in the future if the event had not occurred and many would have appeared in others' visions. That alone should easily have answered the ""can the future be changed"" question."
2,Just so-so,"It's an interesting concept, although Sawyer does not present the science in a way that makes it believable and his ability to draw characters is limited. But if you're not too picky and you're willing to read a book just for the unusual ideas, then give it a try."
3,"Not bad, but the TV show is better","I picked up this book because I like the TV show so much that I wanted to learn more. There are major differences between the two, mainly that the flashforward in the book is 20 years in the future, while the flashforward in the TV show is only 6 months. I think 6 months makes the story more compelling, and has a more immediate effect on the characters and the choices they start making.While the book centered on scientists and explained the scientific cause of the flashforward, I prefer the FBI agents on the show not knowing the cause. I have to admit that all of the scientific explanations bogged the story down and I skimmed over those pages.Gave this a 3 out of 5 rating as it's a great premise and I enjoyed it, but it was a little on the dry side and I could have done without all of the science. Not a must read, but just okay."
1,Fascinating premise marred by writing style,"Sawyer has done some truly wonderful books. ""Starplex"" and ""Factoring Humanity"" have secure places in my permanent collection. His work, however, has always had bits of what I term ""arrogant liberalism"" acting as anti-grace notes to the story, and this one is the worst yet. Example: ""And Canadians didn't like guns, either - they had no Second Amendment, or whatever damned thing it was that made Americans think they could go around armed."" The product of the most profound thinkers on society and politics Earth has ever produced is airily dismissed. The book is studded with similar passages, and eventually they get on the nerves. I gave up after chapter 17 of the bound galley I read. Even the fascinating question of whether scientific foreknowledge precludes free will couldn't keep me in this book."
3,Flash Forward,"very small book format, would have preferred better presentation to read,looked like Readest Digest size,lacked gravitas."
3,"Better than I thought, but the TV Show is much better.","I picked this book up a few weeks ago as I began watching the new TV show and thought, heck, I'll give the book a read and see how much the show messes it up. Well, boy was I surprised to find that the show is infinitely better than the book---first time I've ever experienced that. The good news is that this book introduced me to the worlds of Robert Sawyer, who I thought did a nice job with this novel and I enjoyed his writing style. In fact, I've recently started Calculating G-d, and it's terrific! There is at most a tenous relationship between the book and the show, so if you're looking to gain some insight into what's going to happen next on the show stay aaway from the book. If, however, you enjoy an interesting premise and terrific writing grab this novel and run."
4,good but having lots of powder,"these gloves are good, fits well but they left lots of powder on my hands when i remove them so i have to wash my hands"
3,Perry & Sanlin,"I recently purchased this cd.Upon listen I was only pleased with one song.#4,Just to make you happy.Don't get me wrong I'm a true phil perry fan From his days with the Montclairs to his present efforts."
3,Good Ole' R&B From The 80's,"For those who love you was an ""Average"" ok project from ""Perry & Sanlin"". I felt there second album ""We're The Winners"" for Capitol Records was ALOT tighter. Japan should have reissued them both, just my opinion...."
1,Misleading,"I have a 17.5"" mac book pro and when i recieved the bag it was WAY too small. I tired extremely hard to fit my computer in it and it wasn't going to fit. The title for the bag is very misleading. It says 18"" but when you recieve the bag and on the tag the deminsions read 18"" outside and 15.25"" inside. They need to retitle this item becuase of how it is MISLEADING."
2,Boot print and stains,"When I read a couple other reviews about stains on this laptop bag, I never in a million years imagined I would get a product with stains.I just received it today, and the canvas has a boot print (yes, a boot print) and heavy dirt stains on the edges of the fabric. I can see the original color of the fabric on a 2"" x 4"" spot where something was obviously laying on the bag--while the rest of it collected dust.Who in their right mind would ship something in this condition? Obviously not someone who cares about quality or their customers.Otherwise, it's a fairly cute bag, but I can't get over a company that sends out flawed products--repeatedly, probably purposefully, just to get rid of them."
4,pepper mill,"great pepper mill, had to figure out how tight to make it for the grind I like. good price. thanks.."
1,doesn't work,what a waste of time and money. the thing doesn't even work. lame. i'd return it but it will serve as a reminder of how i got ripped off and to be more careful in the future. especially from this crook.
1,Disapointed,Peppermill grinds too fine. No way to adjust the coarseness of the peppercorns. One or two turns and you have way too much pepper on your food. Will buy a different brand than the Olde Thompson Imperial Walnut Peppermill next time....
4,"Well Written, Factual","This is a well written account that includes documents, affidavits, and testimony. I would recommend this book to anyone who has followed this case because of the factual content. The hope of Cheryl Ford and Dr. J. E. Craddock is that those in power will be inspired to change the systems that failed Terri."
4,not bad,"i baught both of these on vhs, a pretty good find. I must say, I just wasn't made for these times was great. a very interesting look into brian's life. i just hate how most documentries completely disregard what happened in the 80s/early 90s in regards to brians life. i know there wasn't much, but i would have liked to see it all. but still that was great. now, for an american band, that was ok. it wasnt as good as ijwmftt but it had some interesting footage. most of when brian was in the bed was interesting, however, it did get a bit tedious to hear only a little beach boys history. i would have liked more, but i guess thats what ""endless harmony"" is for. so i would recommend getting both thoes films. you get the good documentry, then the videos and rare footage, then you get brian's story, the brains behind the band. together it all makes for a great package for your beach boys fan, or your beginner."
3,Brian Wilso/Beach Boys,"The first DVD I ordered wouldn't load up on my main system. When looking at the disc, you can see lots of scratches. It was a used and returned item. Amazon graciously told me to destroy or give to someone and not return it and another was sent. It too would not load except in the computer.Not what I would expect from any business is paying for new and getting used.Derryl Harris253-9705754"
4,Good for the price,"This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against. I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality.The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error. I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not ""saved"" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas."
1,Stopped working after a few months,"I guess you get what you pay for, though a hundred bucks for a product that doesn't work right after a few months doesn't seem cheap. I bought this as a Christmas gift last November (2007). It worked OK for a couple of months, though the picture quality was never that great. Then we had to start hitting the 'reset' button to correct a distorted screen (a wavy screen, not just aspect distortion). Eventually the distortion led to half the screen missing, and the other half distorted, and the reset button no longer fixes the problem. It's over 90 days since purchase, so the store won't take it back, so I'm left with a piece of junk."
5,Great sing-along songs,"My kids loved this album well beyond their toddler years. Great for long trips in the car. Catchy tunes, great songs"
4,Great Kids' Songs,"Had a cassette of this when my sons were little. When I found it on CD, I purchased it to play for my preschool class."
5,Bring back wonderful memories,"Great CD's !!I listened to the Original cassete with the book when i was young, and now that i have my baby i tracked all over the internet the cassete, only to found the great news of this bundle."
4,Entertaining B film,"First of all, contrary to another review, some people actually like the story, acting & mood of this film, which has nothing to do with a handful of shots of Dellasandro shirtless. I am straight. I am not a homosexual. It takes a perverted mind to claim that this practically family film is a gay film. It is NOT. That's like claiming that Rocky is a gay film. It is not. Terminator isn't a gay film either. I'm sick of perverts trying to claim that innocent things are gay when they ARE NOT.It's an enjoyable film with Dellasandro as a mysterious gardener who can grow plants better than the existing gardener, and can even grow things that aren't in season. The Mexican help for the house sense the evil and appropriately stay away. The other women are blinded by their sexual attraction to him.If you're familiar with the Greek story of Persephone, this film shares some elements from that mythology."
4,Works !,Charges a bit slow. But then my original NP-FE1 battery (which shipped with the camera) charged slow too. Pretty good for the price.
2,Fire Photon Torpedos at this book . . .,"It's only marginally funny in places. I think perhaps it might have overreached itself (A Trek Too Far?) and is only occasionally funny. I loved the Dr. Seuss bit, though . . ."
2,Only works if you know what it's trying to parody.,"It has it's funny moments, but I was lost when it was ""written"" by authors I'd never heard of. And be warned it does contain sexual content."
1,STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID,"Thank God that Gene Roddenberry is dead. If he wasn't, then this would absolutely kill him. As it is, he is probably turning over in his grave. From the way that this was written, it is obvious that Paramount had nothing to do with it, nor did they authorize it either. As far as paradies go, this is the absolute worst. I ordered this book thinking that it was one of the regular books that come out every month. Boy, was I mistaken!!! I returned it as fast as I could."
4,Gleeful entertainment,"One of the best--and most literate--Star Trek texts out there, this collection of short parodies should be enjoyable to any reasonably-well-read Star Trek fan.The only thing to note is to be sure you're familiar with most of the authors involved before you read the parodies, as the true fun is in seeing how successfully Boyett mimics many different styles, from pitch-perfect Tom Robbins to superb faux Joyce (!) to Anne Rice, to J.D. Salinger, to..."
5,Ignore this German guy - TONS better than BEAVER PAPERS!,"This book is far more extensive and parodic than THE BEAVER PAPERS could have hoped to be! ""BP"" suggested the style of other writers; TNT is written IN the style of 20 different writers. It's hysterical, literate, broad, subtle, and best of all, doesn't pander but trusts that you're in on the joke. The MOBY DICK parody opens with ""Call me irresponsible,"" for gosh sakes!"
3,Smooth bugs,"Well, the Beatles are not the best material for jazz artists, not even smooth jazzers... However, some of the perfomances are quite subtle - McCoy Tyner really shines, for instance, Arturo Sandoval's band is really cooking, and I have never heard Diana Krall sounding better (BTW; I'm not her greatest fan)...Well, if you like GRP-style music, this is the album for you, if not, wou can live without it."
2,Berserkers Deserve Better,"Berserkers are among the archtypical monsters of science-fiction. They are machines capable of self-replication and self-repair that exist for no other purpose than to eliminate life, which of course has predictable consequences when said machines encounter humanity. The Berserker represents several common themes of science fiction--the potential danger of artificial intelligence, the wisdom of unleashing the ultimate weapon, the unknown dangers of space, parallells between artificial and natural intelligences, etc. Unfortunately, none of these ideas are explored in this book. The original stories were great, but Berserker Prime doesn't come close to delivering on its promise."
2,Disappointing,"Earlier books in this series had led me to expect much more than this installment delivered. Sadly, it reads like the work of someone who has run out of new ideas, and is milking the old ones for all they're worth.We don't really learn anything new about the berserkers. We don't care much about the characters. There's precious little science in this science fiction. And the book itself could probably have been 10 percent shorter if Saberhagen's characters could just stop using his made-up swear word (it's ""motherless"").Out of respect for earlier books in the series I finished reading this one, but I can't see myself picking up another. If you enjoyed the berserker books do yourself a favor and skip this one, and leave those pleasant memories intact."
4,Decent live-action interpretation of a hilarious anime,"This film from the 70's (based on Monkey Punch's ""Lupin the 3rd"") is actually an interesting film for Lupin fans. The story is like a prequel to the mangas and animes. The movie shows Lupin the 3rd's first encounters with Fujiko Mine, Daisuke Jigen, and Inspector Zenigata. Though the film relies heavily on slap stick comedy and 1970's music, which actually works well since Lupin's plot has a very ""70's"" feel to it, it's a very good comedy. Reccomended for Lupin fans, and anyone who enjoy asian comedies ""Like Kung Fu Hustle"".Warning, this film is entirely in Japanese, with English subtitles. No English dialoge. Just letting you know"
2,Augh!! Falls apart!,"Nice sculpt, as always with McFarlane Dragons, but I haven't been able to display it since it keeps falling apart. The wings! The stupid wings!! I eventually gave up and tried gluing them on but they STILL fell off!I can't even get the dragon to sit on the metal pole it came with.Only get it if you like the sculpt so much that you can bare it falling apart on you."
3,A nice display peice.,I buy this series to have somthing cool to display at my house and they do the job quite well. They look really cool and are a nice alternative to candles and other thigs you'd normally display. I really do not think they would make a good toy though as they aren't very articulate and can break easily. Mine came broken in the package from transport.
2,I was disappointed,"This was just not what I was expecting, I had hoped this would be more of a work out or learning experience."
3,St. Peter and the Early Christians,"I don't like the way St. Peter was portrayed as a drunken man who committed adultery, but I do think it probably was a good depiction of life of the new Christians after Our Lord was crucified with their thoughts that Christ's return was eminent. All-in-all kept my interest and was a good read."
5,... not enough words to describe how great a book this was.,You have to read this book it was the best book ever to be written and one you simply just can't pass up.I rated it a ten only because there were no higher choices!!!There is just not enough words in the english dictionary to describe how wonderful a book this really was!!!
2,Gold Shine Coating Came Off...,"First, before I get flamed, I'm not here to knock on the quality of the lug nuts, which I agree is pretty good quality. BUT! For a set that is close to a ~$100.00, all my lug nut locks (gold color) are turning to chrome, hence that makes me believe that they just sprayed a thin layer of some kind of shiny gold on the locks? The other lug nuts are fine, but ALL 4 lug nut locks were gold and now fading to chrome, what's up with that?! Again, for something that supposed to be great quality and let me repeat close to a ~$100.00, hence the 2 star review."
4,Great sets of lug nuts & locks !,"I recommend it.previously i had bought just the 4 sets of locks.I tried the lock key from that to this but didn't work even though they had the similar type design !this is GOOD !i recommend it ! but hope it doesn't that too popular because then everyone will have the keys! haha jk...get this and STAY AWAY FROM THE INTERNAL HEX Design, they BREAKKKKK ! I know mine did many times when loosing !"
1,Disappointing Book,"Hardly a ""top-notch"" directory, this book is disappointing in so many ways. It's an obvious attempt to cash in on a popular topic. The information only vaguely represents what is available in distance learning today. Much of the book seems to be a ""cut and paste"" exercise on the few schools the authors (who obviously were sleeping at their desks during that Research 101 class) want to endorse or feel they have to include for no particular reason. Many important ground breaking schools like Excelsior College and Charter Oak are completely ignored. The authors might also be interested to know about some recent innovations in books like a ""table of contents"" and an ""index."" Readers seem to find these helpful. My personal recommendation is Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning by John Bear. It's been continually revised for the last 25 years and is a comprehensive guide to distance education. I expect to see this one in the outside bargain bin for 25 cents real soon!"
2,Needs A New Edition,"This is a useful book, but a lot of improvement is needed. A table of contents would have been very helpful, or, at least, the list of colleges in the back could have been accompanied by page numbers. That was a pretty silly oversight.More importantly, I've been researching about thirty business administration programs and only about a third of them are listed in this book. The programs are well-publicized on sites like WWW.ClassesUSA.Com and (I'm fairly certain) all accredited. The problem is that if you want answers to questions without giving the schools your home phone number, you really need a book like this. Since new programs start all the time this book is really way out-of-date even if it's only from 2000. Still it does provide phone numbers that are often hard to find on the schools' websites and the entries often list sample course titles and program requirements. Hopefully, an improved and updated edition is forthcoming."
4,Good Reference,This book helped me alot. It seems to think of every degree possible and let you know which programs are accredited and what to stay away from. Gives you the schools and what they offer. Also help with financial aid.
1,Get Your Degree Online,The book is not comprehensive. It omits many institutions and majors. Do not recommend.
5,"Original, thought-provoking and worryingly realistic","Mills has created a masterpiece in The Scheme For Full Employment. 'The Scheme' unfolds quickly in this short story and an amusing twist lies beneath the day to day drudgery of the characters' work. When you start to find out more you find yourself wondering how many similar 'Schemes' might exist in our society today...I read it in an afternoon and became totally engrossed from the first page on. The author's attention to detail is fantastic although find yourself reaching the end and realizing that you know more or less nothing about the characters other than their names and their role in The Scheme... all part of the geniusThis is a fantastic, bite-size read and the sort of book that you can pluck out and talk to people about to guarantee a laugh. It even looks good on the shelf!Well worth buying along with anything else by Mills"
3,Not a bad read,"I was hesitant to pick this up after reading other people's reviews, but I went ahead anyway. It's actually not that bad of a book unless you're expecting something revolutionary or mind boggling. It was a fun, quick read that presented some interesting ideas. My only minor gripe would be that it ended rather abruptly and without much ado, compared to the rest of the book. I'd recommend it though."
2,Blech.,"I reallly enjoyed Three to See the King, but this stunk. It's a 10 page short story hiding behind the flab of a 200 page novel. And the novel's resolution (which can be described as nothing much changes, without giving away any details) is way too apt a critique of why this is such a boring read. Nothing much changes. You could start reading on page 1, 11, or 111 and have pretty much the same experience. Give me my 2 hours back."
1,Beyond Bad,"I could kick myself for buying this book! It's so awful, I can't even get through it. From the book blurb, it seemed as though the ""story"" (if you can call it that) was about a small group of men who are pulling the wool over their employers eyes. Not so. Instead, we're told (sort of) of ""The Scheme"" which, if you stop to think about it, really makes very little sense. What is the point? I mean, this company generates no revenue, so how is it able to employ so many people? How can it really be considered a ""Scheme"" if everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) is aware of what's going on (the narrator points out that all of London envies ""The Scheme"" workers). I just don't get it. What is the POINT here? I've never heard of Mills before, and certainly am not going to risk wasting another $14 on any of his other books. This one is just awful."
2,1st Year Grad. Student,"I'm taking a spectroscopy class in which we are using this text. I find it to be very poorly written. NMR thoery is a very complex subject, however it is made more complex by the MANY errors we have found in the calculations and tables of the book. Some things are also very poorly explained. I'm very disappointed with it, but to be fair, with some supplemental reading you can get a good foundation in NMR with this book. I pity any UG that has to read this."
2,Better options out there,The book often had mistakes and issues in the problems provided. Also I felt that the way the material was presented sometimes led to confusion. Over all the book is useful as a learning tool but there are better options out there. I borrowed a different textbook from a friend and actually had more success learning the course material that was designed from this book.
5,WC Fields,"W.C. Fields is one of the old time greats! Just a great laugh! I can see ""The Dentist"" a million times and I still lose it - it's great. All of his films are great as far as my husband and I are concerned."
3,+1/2 Waylon's early roots,"An interesting, if sometimes underwhelming, set of Waylon Jennings rarities, recorded before he signed to RCA Records in 1965. This includes an early rock'n'roll single he recorded in 1958, under the guidance of fellow Texan Buddy Holly, whose last band Waylon was in for a short time, as well as several indie releases and singles made for A&M, just before RCA got wind of him. A lot of cover tunes, and some early stabs at the folk-country sound he would mine throughout the rest of the decade. Some of the material is flat, some of it a little strained, but Waylon fans will still want to check it out, just to hear where it all began."
2,false purchase,I am not too happy with the purchase of the product I bought. I kept it only for the fact that it was part of the collection of mine that I did in fact need. My intintions were to purchase the other figure that which a picture showed completely diffrent to what I actually received. This makes me very weary of buying anymore products from this site again.
3,Great for Display,The dragon itself I wanted for display and I really loved it. But I had thought this was the series 2 box set and it wasn't. It's still a good buy.
4,WRONG PICTURE!!! but is a nice series 1 Repaint/Redo,"I have all the series 1 McFarlane dragons. This item is a delux repaint of the series 1 Eternal Clan dragon (not the series 2). That's the one, that has a dragon standing on a roof, its wings folded at its sides, and a dragon rider on its back. Orginal color is green and dark yellow. The Repaint one (this item!) tan, rust red, and blue. Spawn.com should have all the info you might need. I like am both. et"
3,Very nice watch,"I wear this watch all the time and in most respects its great. Very easy to read display and bright night light when needed. I had to replace the original battery in about 6 months, and I'm hoping life of a fresh battery will be greater. At night I sometimes hit the wrong button when trying to use the light, and get into a mode I can't easily get out of again, which is an annoyance.Overall, good looking (if you like camo), comfortable and easy to see."
5,Make JMF your next DVD BFF,"For those who remember this Night Flight classic, this is a long overdue treasure. For those who have never seen it, get ready for a very funny movie done in the style of Woody Allen's (back in the 60's when he was just funny) ""Whats Up Tiger Lilly"". An overlooked comedy made by some members of the Firesign Theater, this is in my top ten list of favorite comedies of all time."
2,I LOVE BRITNEY,"HOWEVER........................This CD single is absolutely crap. The song itself is really good, but the tracklisting is awful. You only get ONE audio song, which is ""Do Somethin'"" itself. The other two tracks are videos, but when you use them on your computer, they don't come out very well. Um...DVD FORMAT SUGGESTED?Tracklisting:-01 Do Somethin'02 Do Somethin' - Video03 Megamix - Video"
3,The BEST of Clint Eastwood (Film Score Anthology ),"I bought this cd for the long trip back to Australia from Germany two years ago just for the hell of it and to possibly get some sleep. However now it is permenantly located in the cd stacker in my car, for when ever road rage kicks in. A must buy for Easty Fans world wide. Purchase and enjoy the trip! By the way the track Lables are in German, however if you know The Man's movies you shouldn't have any worries placing the music. Cheers."
4,Good core workout,It is a good core workout. Not too strenuous but well put together and very enjoyable to do and it is only 48 minutes.
4,great core workout,Just did this video for the first time yesterday. Boy am I sore today! I work out nearly daily and consider myself in decent shape. You definitely work different muscles with this workout. I will try to do it once a week.
3,Eh...,"As someone with a very well defined core, I was looking for a challenge. I have a couple of Bobs Inside Out Method dvds and find them to be really great workouts when used with challenging weights. The challenge I was looking for was not found in this DVD. My core was not challenged. I use it as a light day workout just for something to get me moving and blood flowing for the day on the off chance tha I feel like being ""lazy"" that day. Maybe good for beginner?"
5,Feel it the next day,"okay, so when I did this workout I was thinking it did not push me aerobically, however the next day my abs and side obliques were sore for 2 days. This is a great core workout, just be prepared to feel it the next day"
2,Nothing for relatively fit people,"I'm pretty fit 50 years man. I'm involved in fitness, completed P90X, use TRX, kettlebells, a marathon runner, etc. This DVD is a joke. Unless you're a ""couch potato"" who want to start to move a bit, it won't add anything to your fitness. A very general superlight weight nonsense exercises."
4,Challenging!,"I don't have much to say about this DVD, other than it is a challenging core workout. I like both Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper and I can say, both are challenging instructors. I am loving Bob more lately because his workouts are 1hour long and I feel I need to push myself for longer periods of time to feel challenged. I love working my core and this workout does just that. You will need dumbbells for some of the moves, but he also incorporates a lot of plank variations. If you like Bob as a trainer, you will love this DVD!"
5,Sooo good!,"I have several work out DVD's and this is by far the best. Very good/tough workout, but fast paced, and makes me work up a huge sweat and good cardio workout. I highly recommend this video to any person that works out at home."
4,nice beginning!,"This is Leon's first album for United Artistsfrom 1972 and it's nice. It is quite shorthowever. Only 9 tunes. It also shows more ofhis gospel side than the quiet storm seductiveness of later recordings. ""The Spirit Never Dies""is a memorable standout."
4,Thomas Jefferson as you've never seen him before.,"Rick Matthews tackles the often overlooked Jefferson. His ""banishment"" to France during the framing of the constitution.His friendship with Madison and Madison's patronization of Jefferson's ideas of democracy. The ""bill of rights"" and Jefferson'slone conquest to have them adopted.""Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is not all that Jefferson espoused.His infamous quote ""that a little blood needs to be spilt in every generation,"" sentchills down the spine of the founding fathers who did not share Jefferson's belief inperpetual revolution.Rick Matthews does a masterful job in surfacing Jefferson's true beliefson government, democracy and liberty, all the while illustrating the cooptingof Jefferson by his peers. If Matthews falls short, it is in his virtual disregardfor Jefferson's Presidency where many of the more radical ideas arenot instituted despite the rise in power of the Jeffersonian vision."
1,Terrible Scholarship,"Matthews specializes in revisionist pseudohistory for the limousine liberal crowd. This book tries to portray Jefferson as a Democratic Radical and a quasi-socialist. The author is muddling his own socialist, left-wing philosophy with Jefferson, but misinterpreting quotes and out right fabrication. Matthews is down right distortive of both Jefferson and Madison...I'd instead recommend Mr. Jefferson by Albert Jay Nock and The Constitutional Thought of Thomas Jefferson by David Meyer. The biographies by Dumas Malone are worth noting, but there is no better way to understand Jefferson than read his political writings. Get the Library of America volume with Jefferson's writings."
4,Modern rudeness in Southern California.,I think this book helps deal with some of the upscale modern rudeness of today. Living in Southern California is a Real challange to ones patience and older style of upbringing.
3,Fun to read but ...,"Like the other reviewer said, this is a fun little book to read. But many of the suggestions are common sense ... I can see how this book would be helpful in modern-day dilemmas such as public cell phone use, or cutting in line at the grocery store. Since it is such a quick read, I would recommend that everyone read it atleast once, as a refresher course. Perhaps you may be guilty of annoying habits and not know it. :)"
3,Nice,Not exactly what I expected but good pointers! Can definitely use some of the suggestions that were given. Had some inquire about it's contents
4,Pernell Roberts,It was Pernell Roberts who starred as Adam Cartwright on 'BONANZA' and as John McIntyre on 'Trapper John MD'
3,Swimming Mississippi,"The story is about Cleo, but not only about Cleo. It is also about Madeline, who has this thing with jumping into the Mississippi and try to swim there. Cleo witnesses Madeline's first (actually, we find out later that it is her second) attempt to swim the river. Cleo becomes obsessed trying to find out what happened to Madeline, after she finds out that Madeline did not die from her swimming. In her quest to find Madeline, Cleo tours around The French Quarter in New Orleans, and the author has done a nice job descriping the city, the streets and the bars. While Cleo is searching, we also follow the life of Madeline, and via flasbacks we learn about their past and their families. Spelling Mississippi is a good book, but it moves a little slow, and is in some parts rather predictable. There are many cliches in the book, and that becomes a bit annoying, but there are small surprises here and there. All in all a nice, but somewhat average, read."

5,Great product,I bought this for my husband who travels a lot for work. He was always carrying around separate tie boxes in his suit case or just shoving the ties in the suitcase. He absolutely loves this product! You can only fit a few ties in there - I'd say no more than 4 or 5 - but it's great for traveling and is small and compact.
4,Great travel accessory.,"This is a great travel accessory. It holds as many as eight ties, and has an attached pocket for cuff links."
3,Fair Product,"This travel tie case will hold up to 4 ties comfortably. Care must be taken to place the accessory pocket so that it does not crease the ties. I cannot imagine what damage would be done if something were placed in the accessory pocket. If you cut out the pocket (I haven't done so) the case might well hold 6 ties, if carefully placed in the case.It must be said that having a case is better than having none and there aren't any others on the market. So if you travel I recommend the product, but suggest care in use."
1,POOR QUALITY!,"""This item is POOR Quality! I bought two, one for me and one for a gift. First time I went to zip it closed the zipper broke right off. If you plan on putting 4 ties inside, good luck closing it and if you do your ties will be wrinkled. I wouldn't buy this item."""
5,Great Way to travel without wrinkle and with many ties!,I have a family member who travels for business trips but could only take one or two ties. But this allows him to take 6 or 7 ties! I recommended this to any one who travels in suit attire.
1,Piece of junk,Took less than a week for this thing to fall apart. You'd get more use out of your money if you used it for toilet paper.
3,Adequate....,"I got tired of my ties getting knocked around when I travel and ordered this case. The case does what it says but I think it's too short. I've never tried to store 6 ties but that would seem crowded for such a narrow case.Still, the case protects my ties and takes some punishment while in luggage. Zipper works well and it should last with proper care. Overall, I recommend this case."
4,Kinda small,"Although it is advertised as ""holds 6 neck ties w/ Accessory Pocket"" I had a hard time just fitting in 6 ties without any accessories. When I did use the accessory pocket, I could only fit 4 ties, and even then, it took a great deal of pulling and squashing to get it zipped close."
5,Great for travelers,"We got this for our son-in-law who travels a lot. It's a bit larger than we anticipated, but will keep his ties in shape for travel."
3,As a gift item,A little padding inside would keep the ties from curling - up. It is okay as a gift. Prabuddha gupta
2,Zipper frustration,"Seems like a nice case and I would have loved to have used it. However, the first time I opened it and tried to close it again, it took about 15 minutes to get the Zipper to close properly. There is a fundamental design flaw in the zipper and it cannot round the corner to zip close. Otherwise, it is a nice case. However, I sent mine back."
5,It is possible to get past the pain,"This book was the first book I read about women suffering with past abortions. I suffered in silence for over 20 years and after the birth of my son, my suffering became even more intense as I went through all his ""firsts"" and came face to face with my loss. When I finally had the courage to tell someone my ""secret"" I was told about this book. It was the first step to healing. Two years ago I attended a post abortion healing group which has helped tremendously. There are so many women suffering from past abortions. If you are suffering in silence there are many resources for you to help you get the courage to find healing."
2,Judgemental,"What if you had an abortion and don't regret it? What if you had an abortion and would go back and make the same decision over again? What if, however, you still have some hurt and pain to deal with? This book assumes that you regret your decision. This book assumes that you feel you did the wrong thing. I don't. I was searching for some non-judgemental help. Not in this book. Why don't the authors understand that you can feel bad about the abortion but not that you think you did something sinful or that you wish you hadn't?I then read The Healing Choice by Candace de Puy and it is much better. It is spiritual without being ""religious"" and doesn't start off with the premise that you committed a sin. It helped me a lot."

4,"nice case, questionalbe reliability","I'm using this case very extensively with my 6620. It fits the phone snugly, and the plastic sheet covers the keypads too (which I like). There are openings in the platic cover wherever you'd expect them - microphone, loudspeaker, speaker, joystick etc. And I use it regularly to hold the phone in my belt. The leather seems decent too. My only reservation though is the price - when you can get a phone for free these days, I do think twice when charged $20 for its case.** An update: after about 6 months of use, the case broke down. And I've (accidentally) dropped the phone by itself more often, but the phone survives admirably well. When a complex pice of electronics such as a phone can survive several falls, I'm not impressed with the plastic case breaking down after a few months. Amazon doesn't let you change the star rating, so I couldn't lower it from the 4-stars I gave initially."
1,More broken glass and lousy packaging.,"Not happy at all, the package arrived damaged, several of the bulbs were cracked, and broken glass was everywhere. It was a big mess, I suffered a few small cuts cleaning it up. The few bulbs that are acutally good are kinda dull and not very useful.My emails to Amazon received no response either. Funny how that seems to happen more and more often lately.F- for this product, D for shipping, F for customer service."
5,Snow White Nutcracker,The Snow White Nutcracker I received is simply beautiful. I received this item within a few days of ordering it. It certainly added to my collection.
2,Oh no! how upsetting!,"I have just listened to 3 of the so called Lee perry tracks.Unfortunately they are not perry productions, but King Tubby's.nuff said"
4,Beautiful Sibelius,"Many of these songs were not originally written with an orchestral accompaniment in mind. But orchestra brings out new colors in these works, that I hadn't realized before when listening to them with piano accompaniment.Hynninen sings beautifully throughout, and is in my opinion at his best in these songs. He has a special kind of light high baritone voice, that doesn't always work well in opera, but in Sibelius it works fantastically. Understanding the language and the cultural background of these songs helps as well.Buy This!"
2,Where's the Beef?,"I thought this might be a good book to compliment the ""Criticism Management"" book by Randy Garner. Unfortunately, this was not as insightful as I had hoped. For my money, a better text would be Dr. Garner's book (mentioned above) or Weisinger's--both deal with handling criticism--the usual trigger for saying things we later regret."
3,True but could have been reduced to a pamphlet,"Everything in this book is technically correct. For some, this will be an extremely valuable book, giving guidance on basic job environment communications. The main idea can be quickly summed up: avoid hurting others' feelings or getting them angry by taking responsibility for the what you say, the effects this has others."
3,disappointing...,"I attended this show and had a fantastic time, so I was very excited to get the DVD. However, the DVD is pretty upsetting. The video is horrible. In no way does this really show the energy of a Phish show, esepcially this particular show in Las Vegas. I was also hoping for more crowd shots and footage of the fans, but it is basically just the concert and nothing else. Sort of like listening to a really good recording of the show on cd with some really fuzzy and sporadic video footage. I really wonder why Phish put something out that was this poor in quality. With this they would have almost been better off just putting it out as a Live Phish relase. It was good for nostalgia and I am sure most fans will enjoy it, but overall I found it to be pretty disappointing."
4,Poor Video Quality- Excellent Audio,"Like other reviewers have said, I was confused at first about the poor quality of the DVD. At first i thought it was my HDTV for some reason but i tried it in different DVD players. Still poor quality.HOWEVER, the audio is near perfect, and I think that phish puts forth a pretty awesome show. My critical ears didnt have a problem with it. I am buying Phish's ""IT"" DVD, and I am hoping it will be a little more professional.I must pay homage to the DVD and say that I literally have spent hours on the couch watching this DVD, and i have thoroughly enjoyed it, which is why, despite poor video, still rate this at 4 stars."
3,disappointingly low energy,"I was hoping for a more jam oriented show and less vocally oriented. Let's face it, they aren't exactly the best singers. I hope they put out DVDs from some of the mid 90s shows. That's when they really rocked!"
3,Great Sound... Bad DVD,"First of all this is a great show and i love watching it.However it has to be one of the most poorly made DVDs i have ever seen. It is very clear to me that fiting the whole show on one disc was the priority, picture quality and dvd design were an after thought. I design DVDs for a living and there really is no excuse for a dvd to stop playing at the end of the movie (dvd does not return to the menu). With over 175 minutes of video, they have taken the picture so far down that you can see tons of digital noise and at times the sound is out of sync with the picture. I just hope that they consider a two disc set for there next release. All in all, this is a good DVD and i would still recommend buying it."
2,this show sucks,"I warn you do not buy this dvd. The show simply sucks, the band is not in good form and it shows. It says something when Trey is not even smiling, and he doesn't during this whole show. Trey and the band are obviously bored. I will say that there is a good version of the curtain and a day in the life here though. Hope this review helps."
1,Exhausting...hard to get through,Wow...this video is an exercise in endurance. The narrator is so annoying that I don't know how anyone could ever watch the whole thing!! She sounds like she's reading a children's book of her own poetry about Ireland. It is horrendously awful!I'm considering ripping the audio out and reattaching some of my favorite Celtic music to the video portion just so that my money wasn't completely wasted.Not at all what I expected. A strange experience indeed...
4,very good,"This is a great product, lower sodium than traditional canned refried beans, organic, and just plain great! I use these as a simple side dish, or put them on tortillas and make a quick lunch or dinner. The price is also cheaper than if I bought a can individually every time I wanted some."
3,Make sure you taste these locally before ordering a 12 pack!,I love Amy's foods but the taste of these beans are not my favorite. They taste way different than other refried black bean companies. I think its that they are sweeter? Not sure but make sure you like the flavor before ordering. I just assumed I would and now I am forcing 12 cans of beans down my throat that I don't really care for.Nothing against Amy's or these beans. Just preference.
5,"Really, really love these!","We eat a lot of beans in our house (insert toilet humor joke here), and go through several cans of these a month. We don't miss the sodium at all, and LOVE that they are organic. What a great find from Amazon!"
2,Worst I have had,"This is the strangest tasting Amy's brand (or any other brand I have ever tried) refried black beans I have ever ate. I have tried every brand that I ever found, it this one just tastes odd, and I like the regular Amy's refried black beans. I think it is all the extra ingredients, specifically the green bell pepper and onion that give it such an odd sweet flavor, but I am not sure as I have never studied the ingredients before. Under lying that sweetness is just a bland, non existent, ""watery"" flavor that does nothing for me. I would have preferred a spicy flavor, so I have to add my own. I will not reorder."
5,This one will keep you up nights,I thoughly enjoyed this book. Meagan and Alex came to life. This is a beautifully crafted book with lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down.
5,A sensitive and loving story dealing with death,"Tomi DePaola once again demonstrates his sensitivity in this loving story of a boy, his Nana and her eventual death. Wonderful for young children dealing with the aging and death of elderly people."
4,wonderful old serial,"Today I sat down with popcorn in hand and watched THE RETURN OF CHANDU, both DVDs. It was wonderful! It had the kind of wonderfully improbable plot you don't see now that movies have to be believable. Bela Lugosi, cast against type as the dashing hero, battles evil cat-worshippers for the life of his Egyptian princess fiancee. Good thing he has most of the powers of a Jedi Master! If you want to see the kind of old serials that inspired the Indiana Jones movies, this is a good one to see."
5,awesomeness!!!,"my favourite comicbook hero,loved the 60's and 70's vibe with a modern twist even young kids will enjoy"
4,Fun Series,"I generally prefer the more serious Batman in Justice League Unlimited or Under the Red Hood but this Batman def. has his place as well. A nice throwback to the more comic roots of super heroes. I like the fact that they get lesser know heroes & villains in the mix a good bit.If you enjoyed Teen Titans, you'll probably like this and vice versa I assume.Glad I got it."
4,Gotta have it but,Not really a review but Ill hold off buying this until they have both parts out or a full season available.
2,Why buy this???,"I have no choice but to join the chorus on this one. I am an avowed fan of this series, but it is ridiculous to release the full season in more than one volume. While I object to the marketing tactics, I do love the show. I purchased the individual discs, and I have enjoyed them. It's wonderfully designed, funny, action-packed, and full of nostalgic appeal that addresses the newer iterations of the DCU with a smart mix of reverence and irreverence. Something for the kids and the parents. Top marks for the show itself. One star for crappy marketing."
1,Please reliease all of season one,I am starting to loose interest in this sort of thing. You did it with Justice League Animated and now you are doing it with Brave and the Bold. Give the consumers a break in tough times. Reliese the complete season for a reasonable price.
5,Boltons angriest boys,"This album really does grab you, slap you round the face, and then drives energy and passion into your mined before you can say ""Hand shakes for bullets"". I have seen this band twice and the energy they give out in a there live set, is not lost when recorded. Bloodstained lips really has power and fury that Rage Against The Machine would be proud of. Civilised fury has ideas, anger and life that will make you get up and scream. conveyor belt destruction is a work of art that makes Inme look like a bunch of one-demential fools. They shape and mould anger into something new and refreshing. The drumming has power and meaning. The guitaring and singing blow you away. The end result gets your hair standing up on the back of your neck. Kinesis have just made a new masterpiece. There is still more to come from them, but this album has fired them in the right direction."
5,A long time since I've seen tears on my pages,"I'm a 49-year-old male raised on an Illinois farm and thought I'd long since passed the day when a book of remembrances could touch me so. Fathers out here, and elsewhere I suspect, have learned the art of showing love only lately ... and awkwardly. Brian Newhouse uses the physical act of crossing the nation via bike as a metaphor for his inward journey toward his father's heart. I can hardly speak to how this book might seem to others, but I saw myself again and again in his struggles with faith, with love, and with himself. It's been a long time since I've seen tears on a book in my hands."
4,A very warm and sincere account of a unique journey.,"This story touched me in a way that nothing else has for a very long time. Extremely honest and sincere, funny and heart-warming, I read it avariciously. Having traveled for years myself I found it inspired me to continue doing so. A great account of the pain,satisfaction and revelation that comes with journeys of this kind."
2,Disappointing; not so much about bicycle touring,I found the book disappointing in that it was much less about his bicycle touring and more about his preoccupation with his father. I think the book would have worked out better if he included more of the experience of touring across the country and integrated that with his spiritual journey to understand his father.
5,Inspiring jouney into America and personal discovery.,"A Crossing took me into familiar territory as I too once took off across America (not on a bicycle!) in search of myself. The book speaks volumes to those of us trying to get closer to a father or mother, to a relationship with another man or woman, to ourselves spiritually. In the great tradition of travel fiction (Travels with Charley, Blue Highways), A Crossing sets us on the miraculous road to personal discovery."
4,The conflicts of life embodied at 10mph on a bike ...,"Brian's journey is much like all of ours ... discovery of self, pushing the limits, while struggling to find our own place in the world ... I must wonder now if Brian came to terms with Jesus in the same way that we are left thinking he has come to terms with his father."
3,Second album by Victory,"Similar in style to there debut album,1980's German Hard Rock band lead by singer Charlie Huhn of Foghat and Ted Nugent fame, its a typical 1980's hard rock album with a lot of good songs on it, and well worth picking up if you could find it."
5,A great buy,"This is an absolutely essential set for any true Naruto fan. It begins on Episode 107 which is the very beginning of the ""Sasuke retrieval arc"" where Sasuke is in the hospital recovering from his battle in the previous filler. And goes all the way to episode 135 where he has left the Hidden Leaf village and beaten Naruto in the epic battle at the Final Valley(Or Valley of the End for people who have seen the Japanese version). This is personally my favorite arc so I am very glad to see the entire thing in one box set. If you were to get the original season box sets this whole thing would literally cost twice as much. So its a much better deal. I would recommend this to any Naruto fan looking to complete their collection."
5,Not as good as Vol. 1 but still nice,If you decide to skip the next 3 sets including this one and go onto shippuden that is fine because their is little to no story/character progression for the rest of the series except for the last episode (ep 220) but filler Naruto is still Naruto so buy if you love the series.
5,naruto rocks,Naruto is of my favorite anime since 2005 and also since dragon ball z was my first anime of all time
5,exactly what i wanted,it was a christmas gift. they loved it. we've been watching the whole series in order. its really great. we cant wait to see more
4,The English Voice overs are god awful.,"It shipped very quickly and it is exactly what I expected. Four-five episodes on a disc is annoying since I binge watch, but everything otherwise is perfect. Just please watch in Japanese with english subtitles. It's torture, otherwise."
1,need new copy,I was sent a box with 3 out of the 6 CDs scratch and wont register on any of my computers
5,Very good,"No scratches on the discs, was able to watch every single episode. Little wear and tear on outside packing, but dvds are perfectly fine."
2,The (extremely) Poor Man's Rolling Stones,"I can't, for the life of me, understand the appeal, or better, the necessity for the Black Crowes. To call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they don't possess...There's nothing here that hasn't been done better, with more creativity and feeling, and of course, originality, by the Stones, Faces, et al...And it's not a valid counter-argument that the Stones stole from the great blues masters, because, of course, they did...but what they also did is add some value, something of their own, that was completely fresh...What these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on..."
5,Definitely worth it,"I am more of a casual listener to the crowes. therefore, this album is totally worth it. Unlike other greatest hit CDs, there is no filler. So fans do not need to get this album. This is an album for people who never took a chance on the crowes. must buy."
5,"Better to get the original albums, but a good collection.","This is a good place to start if you're new to the Black Crowes, as it has all their most well known songs in one place. If this is the only Crowes CD that you purchase, then you're missing out on quite a lot. But this is a good CD to keep in the car CD player. It's an excellent cruising disc. I would recommend this to anyone who isn't looking to get into the Black Crowes, but just wants the songs that you hear on the radio. If you really want to get into the Crowes' music, I would suggest buying Shake Your Money Maker or The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion."
3,Large print is great,Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story.
4,Great for someone who knows the language!,"Before reading this book I had already become somewhat familiar with Common Lisp: I had read Land Of Lisp and Practical Common Lisp. Successful Lisp is a great book if you don't want a lengthy description about a certain feature in the language. For example, some of the topics that was covered in a 25 page chapter in Practical Common Lisp was covered in about one to two pages in Successful Lisp. Is this a bad thing? Not if you don't want to know all the little details. If you're looking for a to-the-point description about some feature than Successful Lisp is for you. However, if you want to know some specific details you might not find it in this book (though you might in some instances). I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning Common Lisp, but another book before this one would not be a bad idea."
4,Excellent Debut,"While riding in a San Jose taxi several months ago I struck up a conversation with the driver, asking what else he did. He said he was a musician. When I asked what kind, he said ""you're listening to it."" I was hooked right away, and immediately offered to purchase a copy from him.This cd has a worldbeat, yet pop sound. Within the confines of a basically pop sound, Fontain displays a distinct middle eastern sound. With, at times, pronounced use of the sitar. Highlights are hard to determine. I like the whole album. However, ""Wannabe,"" ""Spiders in the Attic"" and ""Sacred Sacrifice"" have an infectious groove I can't seem to get out of my head.All instruments are played well, but the vocalist has a particularly compelling voice.All in all, a great album."
4,Ben 10 Season four,I purchased this item for my Grandson who already has seasons 1 thru 3. They were excellent so I'm assuming this will follow suit.
3,Ok for the Price,"These are not fine furniture quality. If you're used to cheaper furniture that you buy from the big box stores and assemble yourself, this is furniture quality. Ethan Allen it's not, but then again, the price is indicative of the quality. They are functional and keep the speakers off my end tables and are pretty much hidden by my lamps, so they do what I want them to do. Takes some muscle to turn the screws. Wish I'd had a power screwdriver."
4,Good Book for Those Planning to Have A Marine Aquarium,"This book has the same contents as ""The Questions & Answers Manual of the Marine Aquarium: Practical and Expert Advice on Keeping Fish and Invertebrates"" by the same author but published by Salamander Books Limited (ISBN: 0-86101-861-3).It covers a good introduction of the various gadgets (filters, protein skimmers, ozonizers, etc.) and explains the purpose of such devices. Tank set-up and care are also covered. Common fishes and invertebrates are covered, each in two or three pages with colorful, good quality photos of the creatures.Q & A approach makes reading a breeze. Highly recommended for beginners"
1,Not on my Kindle,I have not received this book on my Kindle therefore I am unable to review. Can you send it to me? I need it for a study class.
5,my inner crochet artist comes to life,"What an awesome book. It didn't take much reading before I had to go out and get a hook and some yarn in order to try to co-create with Noreen Crone-Findlay. Although I hadn't held a crochet hook in over 25 years, her clear instructions and dazzling designs kept me motivated. Lest you be overly impressed, I did begin with Chubby Lady Bug on page 109, an adorable little being, and perfect for a beginner, or someone returning to crochet.I can guarantee that if you like dolls in any of their creative manifestations, or like crochet, you will be held and nurtured by this wonderful book."
5,Listen to the sample clips and you'll know why....,"Franz Liszt is among the most beloved composers. Every pianist (especially the more advanced ones) would fall in love with Liszt the way they do for Chopin. His pieces are challenging but irresistible. The first piece by Liszt I fell in love with was La Capanella. I have a collection of La Campanella played by different pianists, including this one. Frankly, this one is my favorite. Very beautiful, poetic, and each note acts like a soft touch to the very bottom of your heart. The other pieces in this CD are very great also, but just La Campanella alone is worth buying already. Listen to the sample clips and you'll feel it for yourself...."
5,If this too too solid flesh could melt,"A great exercise tape--plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick. If only Denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily, this would really work!"
4,Good workout,"This workout is great- it definitely gets your cardio up, as well as tones your muscles. I do agree that it is kind of hard on the knees, though. It's great for an intermediate/advanced workout, although her cueing isn't great. A step bench and weights really are necessary. The great thing is you can adjust the workout to your level, and still have room to work up from there!"
4,Ultimate Fat Burner Will Make You Sweat,"I've been using this DVD for a couple of weeks now, and I have to say that it's challenged me more than the workouts I'd been doing for the past year (walking/jogging DVDs). Most of the workout is pretty high impact, so if this type of workout isn't something you normally enjoy, then this probably isn't for you. That being said, it's really an intensive workout. I've been feeling it in all of my muscles and working up more of a sweat than with my other workouts. If you have 45 minutes at a time and 3-4 days a week (and can stand high impact exercises), I would recommend adding this one to your regular rotation."
4,Intense Workout!,"I've used this video for two weeks now, and although my percentage of body fat has not diminished, it has provided a great workout. I would not recommend this video for beginners because the steps are quick and a little difficult. The steps are from kickboxing, basketball, even speed skating. They are not your typical aerobic moves and are actually fun to do. I found the three levels of intensity all challenging. When Level 3 was too difficult (i.e. the lunge power move), I simply continued the Level 2 moves. I didn't feel like I was cheating myself out of a better workout.I know that a lot of people think Denise is too cheery, but I found her motivating. She doesn't assume that everyone using the tape is a gym rat.I gave it four stars, though, because a step bench really is necessary, and I needed more space than I had. Overall, though, excellent workout and definitely worth the money."
5,Have had it for years and still love it,I had this video on VHS and needed the DVD version. What a great DVD - used it for years and still enjoy it. Buy it now if it's still $8.99!! Amazon dropped the price 2 days after I bought it by $4!
3,"Good workout, bad cues","Everyone knows that Denise Austin's videos are cheesy, but her lack of consistency in this video drives me crazy. The workout, physically, is a great one. However, Denise Austin does a horrible job of cuing you to the moves or staying consistent in the moves. She can't count, she changes the moves in the middle of the sequence and tells you ""one more time"" when you have 3-4 sets left. Of all of my videos, I avoid this one for the sheer fact that it is frusterating to listen to her. My suggestions are to stick with Karen Voight or Kathy Smith for a good, well lead workout!"
5,Great Video!,I've always struggled with my weight and years ago I used denise austin to drop from a size 10 to a 4 but then over the years I let myself go back to size 10 and I finally decided I needed to start denise again. I started this work out about a week ago and have done it everyday.It is very comparable to the ones I used before when I lost a lot of weight. I'm sure in a few months I'll be looking good again. It is a very intense workout and if you're out of shape like I was you will be sore for many days but just push through its worth it in the end. You do need to buy a step if u don't have one. I bought mine at walmart for about $30. I really recommend this workout.
4,"Circuit training fun, but riddled with mistakes","This is a good video in that the routine is constantly changing, there's no tricky footwork, it's based on moves you'd use during various sports (inline skating, skiing, boxing, and basketball) and it definitely gives you a good workout. Problem I have is that there are SO MANY mistakes made that are not edited out. The instructor very often loses touch with the beat of the music, which throws off the other people working out on the video and throws me off as well. Then there's a HUGE mistake in the cross-country ski section (you can't miss it) where one move is totally forgotten but they somehow just keep going. It makes for a sloppy production, if you ask me. Fortunately it's a simple enough routine that after watching it a few times you figure out how to do it without stumbling over the mistakes they're making on the video."
5,Awesome Workout!,"I am 23 years old, and consider myself pretty athletic. I attend college and I find that I am too busy to fit in a workout schedule. This Ultimate Fat Burner video is so much fun! I love Denise Austin's helpful hints and the variety of athletic moves. The workout is a bit challenging, but each time I do it, I can do just a little more. I've done the workout four times a week for two weeks so far, and I've already seen and felt the results. I have more energy and have lost five pounds. I highly recommend this workout because it is easy to fit into a busy schedule and so much fun!"
3,Too much jumping!,"I am a huge fan of Denise Austin, and this is one of the hardest videos I've used. There is a a ton of jumping around and doing jumping jacks and things of that sort, none of which I can do because of foot problems and being overweight. Apparently some of the people who appear in the video agree, since the guy to left of the screen, in back, kept almost falling over. The other members were kind of off in the cuing and following her instructions. If you're out of shape, it might be a good idea to stick with something a little less strenuous."
5,Sooo nice,"I get nothing but compliments every time someone sees this poster hanging up in my room. I got a black poster frame to put it in, and it just looks so pretty."
3,Great picture.. poor layer switches,"I have had this player for a year and a half now and must say that i have been very pleased with the basic performance of the unit. The picture is more than acceptable, and the sound is above average for an entry-level unit. The problem with the unit is that it has a real problem with layer switching. Patton, Matrix, and Nightmare on elm street are three movies that have all given me problems. The service from JVC is also poor, and many of the problems that i have had do not exist according to them. The only other problem i had is the remote, which has a joystick the the enter key incorporated.. so pushing enter can be difficult and annoying. All in all.. it's a good entry unit. But if you want a more consistant player with better support, you can do better."
2,Soft Porn,"I would only recommend this DVD for couples who are beginners in terms of exposure to adult, sex videos or for couples in which one or both partners are too squeamish to explore more explicit material. My wife and I find it to be downright boring. We watched it once or twice, and it has not made it out of the drawer in months."
3,Minor New Romanticism,"Brooklyn's Ethan Marunas (aka Baby Dayliner) is a lo-fi electroclash troubadour on his debut, High Heart & Low Estate. He dabbles, embarrassingly, with rap convention and hip-hop rhythms. He's the whitest rhymer you could imagine. Luckily, most of his tunes are more indebted to the brighter sides of New Order, Duran Duran and, for a more modern comparison, Franz Ferdinand. In fact, his real talent lies in reinventing the melodies of the new romantics. Opener ""Raid!"" is an ace New Order rip. ""Funeral Dirge"" is like Modern English tune played with two fingers on the piano. ""Lullabies"" has a melancholy melody reminiscent of prime OMD. After that it's hit or miss, and decidedly minor."
4,Baby Dayliner ROCKS!!!,"This CD is hilarious, Hoodlums in the Hit Parade is the funniest outlook of rap I've heard. The last song is entertaining as well. I think this may have been more sucessful as a complete parody CD, but some of the songs aren't that entertaining. All and all worth a listen to get a few laughs."
3,"OK, but not as good as I hoped","Based on the reviews, I really looked forward to buying this toaster. Our old one was beginning to toast very unevenly and was also showing signs of tarnish on its stainless steel exterior. When our new Cuisinart arrived, I couldn't wait to pop in some bread and didn't read the manual. The first batch was burnt beyond recognition, so I then followed the instructions. The second batch came out better, actually perfect on one side but barely toasted on the other. Now, I toast my bread on a lower setting and when it pops up, I put turn it around and put it back in. When it pops up the second time, it's perfect. However, this is not the way a toaster should work, but maybe I'm just too picky."
1,Dangerous Do Not Buy,"This is a so-so toaster. It does what the all do. However, if you are not careful you'll get a really painful burn. Surrounding the slots that you put the toast in and take it out is a rectangular, shiny, chrome-like trim. It's purely for looks and serves no purpose. But, after toasting it gets tremendously hot. If, while removing your toast you accidentally touch it, it's gonna hurt. If you have children who make toast they'll almost certainly get burned.Had I known about this stupid design flaw I would have bought another brand."
2,Junk,"Very disappointed. I realize complaining about a $30 item may be stupid, but I did pay shipping both ways, so I really lost about $11.00 on the deal!Toaster is horrible. One side of toast dark to almost burned, the other side normal to not toasted. Bottom of toast lighter than top -- reason for this: the tongs that ""grab"" the toast only grab at the top, leaving the bottom to lean to one side causing toast to come out unevenly browned. Have no idea why one side toasts darker than the other.Would definitely NOT recommend this product. I gave gave it an additional star (would have rated 1 star) just due to it working when plugged in!"
1,Went up in flames,"I bought this toaster in Sept. 2011 and on Dec. 13, 2011, after very little use,having made one piece of toast set on #2, the toaster, only by chance, was discovered about five minutes later on fire with flames coming from underneath. I picked it up and placed it outside and it continued to burn, with flames, for more than 30 minutes. There is nothing left but the metal insides with the outer plastic completely melted into the gravel I set it on. If I had grabbed the toast and gone to work that day my house very likely would have caught on fire. I read with interest the incidents of others with potential fire problems with this toaster. This toaster is a minus star many times over. I bought Cuisinart thinking it would be a cut above. Boy, was I fooled."
2,Good for two months,"I purchased the Cuisinart to replace a T-fal four slice toaster that would burn one side of the bread and barely toast the other. The Cuisinart worked great for about two months. If you set it higher than 1, it burned everything, but at 1 it was great. After two months we had to gradually increase the setting, 11 months later we are setting it a 3 1/2 to make our toast medium brown, at that setting it barely defrosts frozen waffles. My advice is to purchase the cheapest toaster you can find then throw it away after six months and get a new one. This is what happens when everything is made in China. My mother's toastmaster lasted for 30 years. What ever happened to good old American Quality?"
1,Do Not Buy,"Two major problems with this toaster: 1) Even on the ""lowest"" setting, your toast is too dark, and 2) it toasts the bread very uneven and one side is always much darker than the other. Not worth the money."
1,WARNING-possible fire hazard,"Haven't had mine for 6 months and use it maybe 4x a week for toast. This morning smoke came out, it smelled like plastic burning, quickly unplugged it and when it cooled, removed bottom crumb slot, shook it and tried to see what was burning. Couldnt see anything, popped toast back in, smoke reappeared but luckily this time I found there was a piece of the toaster inside. A strip of the white from somewhere inside had broken off and was lodged against the metal wires. I thought everything was cleared out, cleaned up, tried toasting now just to see if it still worked, my appetite was gone.Smoked again!I was happy with this toaster, maybe its just a fluke mine did this, but its going into trash for safety reasons, I cant risk using it. Read thru the reviews if you're thinking of buying this and see if others have had similar issues."
5,Love it.,"Over the years I've gone back and forth between toaster ovens and toasters. I always miss a toaster. However, I've had problems with them toasting evenly. I think that's a matter of getting what you pay for. I am so glad I bought this toaster. It's certainly a better model than I've ever bought before ( $10 & $12 models). It does toast perfectly...on both sides. I've tried the bagel setting & the thaw setting. Works great.I'm very pleased with this purchase."
3,Same problem as others here,"This toaster worked OK for 2-3 years, but now the toasting arm won't stay down. If you tape it or hold it it down, it toasts, but won't stay down on its own. Now I have to replace the toaster, but I don't think I'll get a Cuisinart again."
1,"OK for bagels, I guess.","This toaster was attractive and compact as advertised, unfortunately it only toasted one side of the bread. I bought this toaster hoping it would toast bread faster than my toaster oven. It did not and I am not interested in stopping the toaster to flip the bread over. Call me lazy. I am going to spend a little more and hope for better results. I'll let you know if I succeed.By the way I have shopped often on Amazon and this is the first time I have had to return a product. I was dreading this but was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was. Thanks for the great service Amazon!"
2,Not worth it in the long run,"For the price this is a good toaster, but after a year we went from having it set on 4-5 to 7-8 all the time. It toasts uneven, and inconsistently. The light for the numbered setting indicator flickers. If you need something cheap, go for it, but if you want something that will last a while get something that is better made."
1,Watch out for burned fingers!!!,"After reading all the postive reviews for this toaster, I decided to go with it. The first time I used it, I touched the metal part on the top and instantly burned my finger - it really hurt! I have since been careful but decided to return it because I don't want my grandkids to burn their little hands! Also, it does not toast evenly. My english muffin is beautiful toasted on one half of one side and then the rest is not toasted enough. Back to the drawing board!"
3,Hard to clean it,It would make a good toaster if the bread sheds inside the toaster can be cleaned efficiently
4,Great Toaster - runs a little hot,"I love this toaster! It runs a little hot, I toast everything at 2 or 2.5. I love the bagel feature, it only toasts the inside of the bagel. Another benefit of this toast, is because it is an electronic toaster, I no longer trip the circuit breaker when I am toasting and running the coffee maker at the same time."
2,No consistency.,"If you don't mind your toast turning out differently every morning, even though you're using the same type of bread and the same toaster setting, then you won't have a problem with this toaster.If, however, you enjoy consistency don't waste your money -- keep shopping."
4,Mornings are back to normal.,"The old toaster kept glowing but you never could tell whether the bread was going to be soft or extra crispy. This white beauty is as functional as attractive. However (the reason for only 4 stars) the back-lighted brownness number spacing is slightly wider than the viewing window. This means that 2.5 looks the same as 3.5, 5.5, etc. Once you find your sweet-spot it is very consistent. Also note that the selector buttons (Bagel, Defrost, etc.) only work after you pull the start lever down."
3,Just threw it away.,"Bought this toaster 5 years ago. Worked fine until it stopped working. IMO, a toaster should last longer, but for $30? Not bad I guess."
2,Uneven toasting,"One side of the bread is burned and the other side is barely toasted... and this is the regular setting - not bagel. It's nice that there are different functions, but I wish that it toasted evenly. I'll be asking for another brand of toaster for Christmas."
1,Terrible Toaster - Don't waste your money,"I bought this toaster based on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. I don't know if CR just didn't notice, but the toasting is uneven, it always toasts one side more than the other, and depending on the bread type, even level one can burn the toast. Not at all worth the money or the positive review from CR. I'm planning on replacing this with tha $3 black friday deal at Target."
1,Lasted Two Years,"This toaster worked okay for almost exactly two years. The biggest negative was that it seemed to toast the first two slices longer than subsequent slices in a toasting ""session"", given the same dial setting.About a week ago, it stopped working. It will no longer hold the lever down (although the elements still come on if I manually hold it). Being an electrical engineer who can occasionally fix a broken appliance, I took it apart and determined the the electromagnet which holds the lever down is bad (no continuity on the coil). The electromagnet is a custom part, so I can't fix it. This is a shame, as the toaster seemed to be reasonably well constructed.Time to order another toaster :-("
2,Not so good,"I've had the toaster for about 1 year and last week the switch just stopped working and won't hold the toast down. I'm pretty disappointed with this product. From the beginning, this toaster toasted the bread more on one side than the other. You had to turn the toast around about half way through if you wanted it even."
3,Like the design/looks,"The knob that controls the toasting part does not seem to hold true to form. Even if it's the same type of bread/bagel being toasted the temp that the little knob controls seems to be off a bit. Have to stand over it, sometimes re-toast, sometimes manually pop it up before it burns. It's a good looking product but for the money not as trustworthy as my $13.00 cheapie-store toaster. It's just ok - If I had known I would not have purchased, too much money."
2,Surprise,I am completely surprised and dismayed at Cuisinart by this product. It not only is very erratic but it toasts unevenly. One side is burnt and the other is not even brown. Also sometimes on a side half is burnt and the rest is not toasted. I am completely surprised by Cuisinart as I always thought they made a good product. I will question whether to buy any of their products again.
2,Caution: Burnt Toast,"I would not purchase this toaster again nor would I recommend it to anyone. Ours burns toast even on the very lowest setting. We have to monitor it and pop the toast when we think it is done.Cuisinart CPT-120 Compact Cool-Touch 2-Slice Toaster, White"
3,Original price midleading,"Nice enough toaster but don't believe you're getting an amazing deal...this product retails for $30, not $60. Honest pricing would be nice."
5,Cuisinart CPT-120 Toaster,The price is what drew me to this toaster. It works great for various size breads and bagels. We have had no problems. It is easy to use and I highly recommend.
2,Fine while lasted,"So the toaster was fine while it lasted, although the bagel setting wasn't really all that useful as it seemed to overcook the bagels, but a couple days ago the outside elements simply stopped heating and shortly after the lever refused to stay down. This with less than two years of use!I see from the reviews here that this is a common fate for this toaster and while I could have it fixed, the cost of mailing it back and providing return postage make such a prospect somewhat foolish. Sigh..."
4,just what the doctor ordered,"I really like my Cuisinart toaster. It has just the right number of control buttons, its slots are wide enough for bagels, and it takes up just a bit of space on my counter. I did my research, and think I made the right choice. I may not use it as much as someone else, but when I do, I always get a perfect slice of toast"
3,only toasts one side,"My husband picked up this toaster after our old one died. It's cute and compact so that it fits well in our tight space. However, it only toasts one side of the bread. I set it to #1 and let it toast, then turn it over and toast it again. Not what I was hoping to do for the next 10 years or so until it dies so we can replace it."
1,Do not buy this toaster.,"I had a toaster that broke after ten years so I replaced it with this toaster, which broke a few months after purchasing it. If I want toast I have to hold down the button otherwise it doesn't stick on its own. Very annoying when you are making toast for a family of 5!"
2,Uneven Heat,"If you like uneven heat on your toast, and the need to flip the bread around to try and make it right - this is the toaster for you!Good Aspects:Wide bays to fit a bagel.It's relatively cheap.The plastic shell stays relatively cool (compared to a metal shell).Bad Aspects:Uneven heat.Way to hot so you don't have much actual range of adujustment. Anything above 2 would result in burning one side of the bread.After about a year and a half, the electronics finally failed. We ended up replacing it with a $20 toaster from Bed/Bath&Beyond;, which allows returns even if you use it and are dissatisfied. It's working for now, but after an extensive toaster search, I didn't find anything that does that good of job. My recommendation: start cheap. If it is unacceptable, return it and work your way up the cost ladder."
3,get it from a brick and mortar,"I got one of these for Christmas. The adjustment for darkness seemed to make no difference, and the cancel button didn't work. I checked out consumer feedback on many brands of toasters, and none seemed to stand out. But this one was a fire hazard, so we returned it (to the nearby brick-and-mortar store it came from) with no hassle. We were offered a refund, exchange or store credit. Because they were so aghast and apologetic, we let ourselves be talked into a different color of the same toaster. The sales clerk had one herself and loved it. Plus, it has a 3 year warranty, although, as noted elsewhere in these reviews, warranties are a big hassle when you can't just bring it back in person. So far, it's been two weeks, and this one is working fine. Still, I'm not throwing out the receipt."
4,Well made toaster,"Bought this as a gift for family and it works well. The only thing I don't like is the body is a little wide and the toaster cover they have fits on tightly. Also, it's designed to have the long end facing front not sideways because the control and gauge is at the back when having it sideways, which they have it due to counter space. It's more expensive but good quality compared to most of the junky ones you see in the stores."
3,Jennifer,I liked the large opening for bagels and homemade bread. It does a good job toasting.I don't like that the numbers on the dial are lit all of the time wasting energy. You also have to push the lever down hard to make the toast stay down.It works fine but I think there must be a better toaster.
2,Maybe I got a lemon,"Looks nice and stays cool to the touch. That's the upside. Unfortunately, you'd better like dark toast because that's all you're going to get. I'm looking for a replacement model and it won't be this one."
1,Uneven toasting,"Very uneven and inconsistant. One side is not toasted at all, while the edges of the other side are burnt. A setting of ""4"" on one day is fine (for one side anyway) but the next day sets the bread on fire. Never have gotten a slice of toast with both sides the same."
1,What a lousy toaster! Even Cusinart Service said so!,"I had that toaster for 10 days and could never get it to toast properly. On a low setting of just 3 then on each piece of toast one side was badly burnt while the other side was acceptable. Then at a 2 setting one side would be OK but the other side wasn't even tan and barely dried! I gave up and called the 800 number and complained. The service rep told me they have had many problems with that model. I'm not an engineer, but the problem is the center coils have twice the number of heating wires than what the outsides have. Pretty obvious why it's a piece of junk. Steer clear of that toaster!!!"
2,Cool to the Touch Inside and Out,"I give the CPT-120 two stars for being cool to the touch and easy to clean crumb drawer. However, just above the crumb plate is the body of the toaster, which is plastic and built like a grille. This requires small crumbs and an obstacle that many crumbs have to get through to make it to the plate. This holds crumbs in the toaster body making it necessary to turn the toaster up-side-down to hopefully shake the crumbs out for cleaning.On toasting, after toasting an entire loaf of bread - sliced at different thicknesses for a test here's my findings.1/2+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Only toasts on one end; Other end is still untoasted1/4+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Still only one end; Burns the thinner slice1+1 inch sized slices-settings 4->: Still only one end toasted; Toasting quality uneven and unpredictableThis is an attractive model but not acceptable for daily use."
2,Good but lasted only a year,"Broke almost exactly a year after purchase; the handle won't stay down anymore, and half of the heating elements are non-functional. When it worked, it worked as described."
2,burns toast,"This toaster at the lowest setting of 1 burns my toast. It also burned one side of a frozen bagel when I put it on defrost.Further, when plugged in, the dial is lit up by a red light. It makes me feel like the toaster is on, and needs to be turned off. I have to keep reminding myself that it is okay. If I can find the box, I'll probably return it. Maybe I just got a dud, since most reviews here are good"
2,A one sided affair,"Each side is toasted differently - one about right and the other about burned. I love the looks of it. Mine is red. I've only used the toast setting. If I had it to do again, I would not buy it - looks good, toasts bad. When I can't stand it anymore I'll make a planter out of it. Based on many other reviews this has been a problem for several years. Doesn't Cuisinart have any sort of quality control? I assume they don't care. No more Cuisinart stuff for me. Back to Oster."
1,"Bad design, worst toaster","I did not buy it from Amazon. It was a gift. Since day one, it burns at the lowest setting. I had to stand watching them and push cancel button to pop the toasts out before they are burned to ashes. Not only it was toasting too long at the lowest setting, it does so inconsistently. I timed it running between 50 seconds and 80 seconds in six tests at exactly the same setting, that was 60% variation from the shortest time! I opened it up and it contains an electronic timer. The construction quality is fine but the design has something to be desired. Don't blame the factory in China. The high quality iPhone/iPad are made there."
3,toaster,It works OK and does a good job. I wish it was a little faster than it is. Guess I could get a better one.
3,Short cord,"The toaster has a short cord and it's on the same side as the control. When toasting bread, English muffins, etc. its difficult to see what the setting is on; also if you leave the toaster plugged in, the light remains on. I unplug the toaster after every use anyway, but I think this could be a safety issue."
1,Slots not long enough,"Tried to put some whole grain sandwich bread (nothing fancy, pretty standard bread found in any grocery store) in the toaster and it didn't fit. The slices rubbed the ends…the slots aren't long enough."
1,CRUMBY TOASTER,This toaster has nine toasting levels: level 1 for burnt to a char to level 9 for incinerated. The quality control department must have been on vacation when this toaster was designed and manufactured. This toaster has not earned its place on my kitchen counter and will be returned to the store where I purchased it tomorrow.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I wanted a simple two-slice toaster that could also toast bagels that I could fit in a shelf, out of view. This is perfect for that. The slots are not long enough for larger slices, but do hold the simple Wonder-Bread size bread, and does toast both sides perfectly. Easy to clean. Lightweight. Worked great for about 6 months, and now it will not hold the bread down, like a spring is broken. For $30, it was a great price, but now that I need another one, it's a $60 toaster, and it's not worth that.Still looking....."
5,Great little toaster!,"This is a powerful little toaster. We leave it on '2' for most of the stuff we toast. It has a bagel setting and a defrost setting, and they both work great. This unit consistently gives a nice, even toasting. We are very happy with our purchase."
3,"Noticeably cheap quality, but does the job...","For the price, this toaster serves its purpose. I'm curious, though, to see how long it will actually last. The quality of the unit is obviously cheap plastic and you can tell this immediately after picking it up. The push down lever is a bit flimsy. Even considering these faults, I think the worst thing about this toaster is the ridiculously SHORT power cord. I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking when they got to that part! Overall, this product is just OK."
1,"Uneven Toast, Broke in a Year","Like other reviewers have said, it doesn't toast evenly. You have to flip the toast halfway through to get it to toast on each side. After a years time the toast carriage wouldn't stay down. The catch is broken. Stay away."
1,Stopped working after only month of light use,"Lever doesn't stay down. Not worth the cost to repair, the only option is to replace it. It is a sad day when something as basic as a toaster can no longer be made well. If I can't find decent toaster, I might as well go back to toasting bread over an open flame."
2,disapponted,"I have a bit of an older model of this toaster (looks slightly different). I am now on the hunt for a new one, because I'm tired of the uneven browning. One part of the bread seems to get burned everytime. I guess I expected more from this brand."
4,Great toaster,Have not used it much yet. But like being able to adjust temperature and degree of color of the toast.
4,Good toaster,"It is a relatively nice toaster, easy to clean but the dial goes up too high I find it burns toast even at the 2 level if yor not careful, so keep it under three unless you prefer burnt toast."
2,"A Toaster That Toasts, But Cool It Is NOT","I'd have to disagree about the Cool-Touch part since it is not cool at all on the entire exterior of the toaster. It's not going to sear your hand, but it's definitely in the upper range of what you call warm. Just based on the temperature of the white exterior I can pretty much guarantee the shiny metal part on the top is probably going to burn you good. Other than that it is a toaster that toasts just fine, but the misleading Cool-Touch name gets it two star instead of a possible 4-star for just being a decently functioning toaster. It is capable of making a good char of whatever you're toasting that's for sure. I like mine in the darker side of a toast and I have to stop at setting 3. Again, if really dark toast is what you seek, this will do it for you as it should. Clean up is nice with the removable tray so I don't have to turn the thing upside down and shake it down like I would my old Proctor Silex."
2,disappointed,It is disappointing to find that this toaster does not toast both sides of a slice evenly.
4,Good bargain that does what it says it will,"Since we received our toaster 6 weeks ago, we have used it at least one every day. Once we determined the best settings for bagels (thawed & frozen) and the various types of whole grain breads we eat, we have had no problems whatsoever. The cool-touch exterior makes quick cleanups after breakfast easy and the only tricky thing has been to figure out how to properly store the cord on the bottom of the toaster (looking at the bottom, wind it counterclockwise around the retainers provided, then loop the last part around the hook so the plug sticks out). The only reasons I did not rate it 5 stars are that the requirement to push settings buttons AFTER starting the toaster is a bit odd, and thin slices are not gripped firmly, so they don't toast as evenly as thicker ones. For the price, this is a VERY good deal."
1,Terrible toaster. Toasts one side at a time.,"The title pretty much says it all...I purchased this toaster based on the reviews, which were more good than bad.I must have received a lemon, because the toaster only toasts one side at a time. We have to put it on a lower setting than we want, wait for it to pop up, turn it around and upside down ad start again. And each new type of bread requires different experimentation.This morning I put in a toaster waffle, selected ""defrost"" and it popped burned on one side. That is the last straw for me.I am going to try again with a Black and Decker and see if the results are better. At this point, they could not be worse."
1,Non working toaster,Purchased this toaster December 05..the center heating element burned out a month ago..Yes it is under warranty - but would have to ship to Cuisinart along with check for repair..seems easier to buy another toaster-
1,Toaster broke after 18 monyhs,I purchased this toaster by Cuisinart and two of the coils burned out after 18 months. A terrible product. The warranty would cost $15. in shipping to replace.
4,Great Toaster,I purchased this toaster to replace a much larger Krups toaster. I am very pleased with the space saving size of the CPT-120. It browns bread evenly and quickly. I recommend it.
3,not bad but not great,I am still using the toaster but it had developed some faults. It doesnt cook as evenly as I think it should. The toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheap toaster that we replaced (black and decker) . We've only used it a few months now. It is A little disappointing. We have several Cuisinart products including a waffle iron or that we've had for many years and still works like very very well.
5,Perfect for bread,"This not-so-tiny toaster does it job really well--I make regular bread toasts every morning at a setting between 1 and 2, and the bread comes out perfectly in about 20 seconds. Browning is not even on both sides of a piece of bread, but I don't mind it at all because overall toasting is good. I have not tried to toast anything but regular bread, but I think the opening might be tight for fat bagel halves.I bought this toaster when it was priced at just $15. The toaster works well, but I'm not sure if I would buy it at close to $30 because you have more options at that price. This toaster is really simple."
4,Great Toaster,"Read the reviews on line so I was aware that this was a great toaster, but had a tendency to burn toast and to keep the dial low, around 2, when toasting. We have been and it has been fine. Have used all the features, reheat, defrost, etc. and it's a simple, easy toaster to use."
1,Just burns the toast,This toaster simply burns the toast black even at the lowest setting. I had to return it because it was just unacceptable.
1,Toast Burner,The Cusinart toaster that I purchased in all probablity was faulty. No matter if the toaster setting was on light the toast would burn. The darker settings burned toast was so badly it was close to combustion. Strangely the defrost setting required three or four attempts to defrost and toast waffles contrary to the what instructions said. I returned the toaster to Amazon and purchased another brand locally which works real fine.
1,Not for us,This toaster had to be disconnected from the wall socket after each use. Why would they make a product like that?
2,"Some nice features, but falls short","This toaster is easy to clean out and looks great. However, it has some problems:1. Although the sides remain cool to the touch throughout the toasting process, the metal top gets extremely hot. A couple of times I've had to extract bread by hand, and have been burned twice.2. Even on the lowest setting, it overdoes my toast. I have to stand by and terminate the process manually to keep bread from getting overdone. I haven't even tried on settings of 2 or higher.3. It has a light which is on any time the toaster is plugged in. I find this annoying, since it conveys no useful information. I find myself unplugging the toaster just to get rid of the light.I would not buy it again, and I may even replace it at some point. Too bad, because I like its looks and its versatility in handling bagels, bread and other items to be toasted."
1,Bad choice,"They put Cuisinart on it and sell it. Don't buy it, though.The preset buttons, Bagel, Defrost, etc., have NEVER worked on mine.The number settings get random results, either warmed or burnt.The number LED always glows, so you have to train yourself to stop panicking reflexively, ""Oh my god, the toaster's on!"" every time you walk past.And today, after 4 months, the lever won't stay down--toaster death."
1,Uneven browning,"The two sides of the toast are not similarly browned. The middle wall has a different gauge wire and glows less than the outer walls, i.e., designed incorrectly. (Cuisinart's customer service is virtually unreachable, by the way.)"
1,TERRIBLE TOASTER,This toaster worked great for a month. Then the lever stopped working properly and half the time we can't get the slots to stay down at all. I do not recommend this toaster. The warranty from Cuisinart is useless - we would have to spend our own money to ship it to them and then include $7 for them to ship a replacement or repaired toaster back.
1,I HATE THIS TOASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this to replace an old toaster that was only toasting one side of the bread. I love my other Cuisinart products so I was very excited to receive the new toaster and I HATE it! It is way too powerful. Bread burns on the lightest setting. I have never thrown out more burnt toast. The only way to get a decent piece of toast is to interupt the toasting cycle. I can't wait to smash this thing with a sledgehammer!!!
4,Happy Toaster,This is our second purchase of this same product. We use it at home and a vacation property. It is a no-frills highly adequate toaster which is all we want. I like the the lighted toasting level indicator. I would buy this product again without hesitation.
1,Worst appliance I've ever bought.,"When I first bought this toaster, I was disappointed with how hot it ran. The ""2"" setting was enough to brown most bread; a ""3"" setting burns just about anything. This on a machine that goes up to ""9""! (Must be the nuclear fusion setting.)The worst thing about this toaster is that it simply stopped working after less than one month. You push it down, but it doesn't stay.Contemporary toasters are basically junk. We were fortunate enough to replace the Cuisinart with a hand-me-down, decades-old, made-in-USA Toastmaster. It works beautifully."
1,Only Lasted One Year,"Yes, this is a handsome looking toaster, and yes, it is inexpensive. (Actually, $20 is about what we should be paying for good, reliable toasters.) The one we bought for $66 in February 2009 only lasted one year (12 months) with normal usage. Maybe Cuisinart should be putting more money in engineering their toasters for durability and and a little less on how ""nice"" they look."
3,"Decent, not fantastic","We chose this toaster for it's smaller footprint - there are so many enormous ugly toasters on the market, and we wanted a compact version. It basically toasts ok, (we don't toast anything fancy) can burn easily, and the supposed LED lights are a fake. We actually returned the first one because we couldn't believe that the light was working; next one, same thing. What looks like it should light up next to the selection button, doesn't. It's just a number dial with a back light. Oh well, it was inexpensive...now we'll see how long it lasts. I had expected better from Cuisinart."
2,Runs too hot; I was burned by the top part,"This toaster has at least 5 settings but over the past 2 years we've only ever used 1 and 2. #2 usually burns anything except half-frozen bread. I know toasters are prone to problems, but I cannot recommend this model. Its tendency to burn almost anything (and you can't just use setting 1 twice, you have to watch it) AND the incredibly hot top part make it trash material for me.See, one day I reached over the toaster and accidentally touched the top metal part with my arm. Ow! I got a blistering burn on my forearm.I've always been careful, but it took one oops! moment to scar me. I was already tired of the poor toasting, but the burn spurred me to be on the lookout for a FULLY cool-touch toaster."
1,Beware!,"This is by far the worst appliance of any size which I have ever purchased! Finally, after 7 months of frustration, I decided to get out my vintage Art-Deco Sunbeam. This Cuisinart (yes, I was sucked in by the name) is hardly compact. and perhaps if you only toasted one type of bread, it might come out the same, although one side would be black and the other side hardly toasted. Try and toast just one slice. Forget it! I hardly need to stand by and try to see inside so that I can push the cancel button before the toast is ruined. Perhaps I just got a lemon, but that's hard to believe."
1,Broken. Lever Won't Stay Down. Is now in the Trash.,Same problem as others. One day the lever wouldn't stay down. It was used almost daily for 2 1/2 years. Still I expect better from Cuisinart.
2,"Maybe it's me, but I expect a toaster to last longer than 4 years...","Bought this toaster five years ago. Loved it for the clean look and the functionality - still do. Next to our coffee maker, it is the most used small appliance in the house. But four years on, it stopped working. I was able to take it apart and fix it. Now it has broken yet again (the sliding arm) and this time I will be looking to replace it."
1,I wouldn't buy it again!,I bought this toaster because of the positive reviews. I have had it for just over a month. I have to set it at 1 to keep from burning one side while the other side hardly toasts at all. I am going to have to replace it.
2,mediocre at best!,"The slots are wide enough but not long enough,it takes a long time to toast.one side of the bread is darker than the other, & is not consistant over multiple uses."
2,Not as great as expected,"I bought this about a year or two ago. It worked fine. Then a couple of weeks ago it just stopped working. The little catch (or whatever it is that holds it in the toasting position) stopped working. And of course there's no way to open it up to try to repair it oneself.On top of that, even when it worked, it spewed little crumbs around it. And it's impossible to clean thoroughly. Maybe that's true of all toasters. But I expected something more from Cuisinart."
3,Compact Toaster,"Works great but each time you use it you have to unplug it which is a real pain, but bought it because of the name brand"
1,misleading specs,"VA 1/2 inch rotaty files and rasps are not 1/2 inch in diameter. They can be up to 1/16 smaller depending on product number. ie: 16671 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 12.0 mm, and 16674 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 11.6 mm"
3,elsewhere,"I got this one back when I was in my mid teens and enjoyed it quite a lot... Back then I was happily devouring Heinlein and Clarke's ""juveniles"" and this has the same sort of flavour to those and Sheffield & Pournelle's 'Jupiter' series. I recently re-read it on a plane trip to Sydney and when I was finished I wondered whatever happened to Eklund.. this seems to have been his last book. Best wishes go out to him."
2,Start Up Isn't Cheap,"This is a beautiful book. It's nice to look at the framed art as examples within the pages.Now, this book claims it's easier and cheaper to do this work yourself - it is if you have a table saw and other power tools already on hand. The recommended mat cutter is almost $300.There are lovely ideas in this book but I don't think it holds up its claim of being cheaper unless you are going to do a lot of framing work. I picked it up at the library with the idea of framing my beadwork, but with starting costs and skills to learn to do this work I'll pay for professional framing and use my time and money for beads and my own work!If you are interested in learning to do this work, I'd say that this is a good book for you to start with. If you're an artist looking to frame your own work, think about how much time you'll be investing in learning to do this work when you could be working on your art."
5,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"Our fellow reviewers helped me with this selection -- Thanks. The book is illustrated sufficiently and has the appropriate balance of text for me to develop my skills to the next level -- artistic frames of various materials. What I didn't find out is wether M. David Logan is the inventor of the various ""Logan"" tools pictured in the equipment section."
4,Another good story,"This second in the Inspector Banks series does not disappoint. I enjoyed it as much as I did the first one. In this book, Banks is on the trail of a pretty cold and calculating killer who has killed a local man and buried him under rocks in the open area in the area of Yorkshire where Banks lives. Banks finds he has to start sifting through some past history in order to figure out who did the deed, and unfortuanelty he isn't quick enough to find out who it is before another murder occurs. People will go to great lengths to keep the past buried. This is a pretty good series and for anyone who likes British procedurals, it certainly fills the bill."
1,Not for me,"This was just not for me. Only read about half of the book, which is something that I normally would not do. Could not get into it."
5,atrac3 > mp3,"to the person who said her daughter dropped the player and it stopped working..all I can say is you should have gotten a warranty. That can happen to ANY portable cd player, not just this one.But on to the review. Yeah..the only negative i could possible give this player is that it doesn't play mp3's in correct order (I think it plays them according to what they were named, rather than track number) but, seriously I converted most of what I have into the Atrac3 format, which sounds just as good for a fraction of the size. I was Very impressed that I could get a about 20 albums on one cd and that the album names and song titles scroll across the screen. And also there is a equalizer built in that doesn't seem to take away from the battery life. Every player I had thus far had a bass boast mode, which sucked the life out of a battery like Dracula on a hot date. And to think I was only looking for a cd player with a good battery life (this one has about 85+). I love it."
2,Carving Set,Not too happy with this purchase. Knive is too thin and therefore flexes too much when used for carving. I do not recommend it.
1,Piece of junk,"It appeared that the battery was dead and it never performed reliably on solar. I couldn't be bothered to even return it, it's in the trash where it belongs."
1,A calculator that can't calculate,This unit would not calculate correctly; it returned wrong results to even the simplest math and would return what appeared to be letters or error codes perhaps but nothing obvious. We didn't open it to use until after the return period expired; it was bought for one that was failing and we didn't definitely need to open it until it was too late :(We bought another brand calculator for business at the same time from Amazon and that one is great!
1,It sucked,"I picked this up at Sprouts the other day after reading a majority of good reviews on Amazon. I've been using this product for about a week now, and I have to say it just plain sucks. It smells more manly for starters, and I still have bad body odor. Eight dollars wasted."
4,Best natural deodorant I've found,"Over the years, I've spent a fortune looking for a good natural deodorant, without aluminum or any harmful chemicals or substances. Of course, it needs to help minimize body odor, and smell pleasant itself. I recently purchased Burt's Bees Deodorant, with oil of sage, lemon and lavender, the spray form (it also comes in roll-on, I believe). It has a nice, spicey scent, and does seem to ""work"". On some days, I notice a very slight odor, but, like some other deodorants, this is not worse than not using a deodorant at all, which is the case for some other products I've tried. Best one yet, I'm quite happy and plan to purchase more Burt's Bees Deodorant."
1,not what i expected,"I had high hopes for this product as i love every other Burt's Bees product i have used. It smells like men's deodorant, but it doesn't work at all for me. I felt like i smelled horrible when i started to sweat and it just created an awful b.o. smell that was worse than if i hadn't worn anything at all!"
2,Turn this invitation down,"The choice of Aphra Behn as protagonist in this 17th century mystery was intriguing. A classic unconventional, independent, rebellious historical figure augured well for a new detective. Unfortunately neither the character of the protagonist nor those of the million or so other characters are drawn well enough for the reader to care the least bit about what happened to them. Well-known Londoners of the time, Samual Pepys for instance, are dragged in to a quick sketch, then left.The plot is contrived, but by the time I came to the denoument I no longer cared. And this is all too bad because the writer has a nice wit and a good turn of phrase. I'd like to see this writer try something a little less ambitious."
2,Not good enough,"Aphra is an alluring, intelligent woman who writes plays and dabbles in the the social scene that swirls around the court of King Charles II. She seems to know everyone, and still remains impoverished though she works very hard. When two former acquaintances, who happen to be brothers, reappear in her life only to turn up dead the next day, Aphra is compelled to see that they get justice. This promising plot fails, mainly because the characters come across as cliches and most of the ""action"" consists of inane conversations of the ""O whatever shall I do"" order. The King's infamous mistresses flounce around being alternately catty or despairing of his ""love"", and Nell Gwyn actually wades into Aphra's investigation.Silly and vacuous. The historical Aphra Behn, who was the first woman in England to support herself by writing, deserves better."
4,Excellent lightmeter,"Excellent product, it works perfectly for outdoor and indoors. The only thing that I mention it's about the user guide, it's a little poor, and there isn't many reference or documentation in its website. For example, if you want to re-calibrate it or change the interval of steps for f/aperture setting, it doesn't mention how do it, and it doesn't have 200s as speed, skip from 180 to 250, and most of cameras, as the nikon, it works or sync at 200s."
4,"Desktop Cradle, Car Charger for Tungsten TX","Product arrived in a timely manner, without damage. Both the Desktop Cradle and Car Lighter Adapter were easy to use. Cradle is comparable with the Palm version that I ordered earlier. No problem with Vendor in terms of promised dates or product quality."
3,Palm TX cradle - inconsistent connections,The cradle works ok but it seems to lose connection with the computer after a few minutes. I'm not sure if the lost connection is related to the cradle or something else.
1,Docking cradle for Palm TX,"While this works good for Windows XP, there are no drivers for windows 7. My palm tx has to sync using wireless rather than this. That makes this virtually useless. I cannot say anything bad about its durability because I can't use it except to charge my TX. It works fine for that but when I can't use it for what it is designed for it has no real use."
5,Highly Improved Model,I had had a previous 'mini-processor' from Cuisinart and over time I wore out the tiny motor. Having found the previous model quite handy I bought the latest one which I find far superior. For one thing it has two distinct functions--one that chops and the other that grinds so it can mince a soft vegetable or grind spices without changing the blade as was required in the previous version. Also it is clear that the motor is considerably more powerful.Highly recommended!
4,good product for the price,I got this item mainly to knead the dough and it works well for that. But the attachments given for grating and cutting veggies are not as great as I thought.
3,"Good, but not stunning","This was the 2nd processor I tried and it certainly does the trick for small projects. I've had it for about a year. It's great if you want to make about a cup worth of something, which is why it's considered small. If you try to make too much of something then it will just pulverize what ever is on the bottom and leave the top unchopped or barely chopped. This can make processing anything more than a cup worth a time consuming effort, you have to put in the food, chop it, scrape it, and then repeat. I've found it especially useful for sauces and dips that need to be completely pureed. It's also great at chopping up nuts (like peanuts for Pad Thai!). I will probably graduate to a larger one eventually but for now it works for me."
2,Nice reproduction of the 11 cup original but underpowered,"The size is perfect, the accessories are the right ones but it is very underpowered. Just doesn't perform like a Cuisinart. Even with just a couple garlic cloves or a half onion (coarsely chopped) it slows down badly under any load and takes forever to finish the processing. Not worth the money, buy a big one or use a knife."
1,poor design,"I sent this back for refund. The design was cumberson and capricous. The food pusher had to go in one way, not the other way and had a hole in the bottom so you could not use for liquids...the cutting blades did a horrible job of mushing the food rather than shredding the potatoes. Very disapointed. Bought a Black and Decker and was happy."
5,happy wife!!,"hi bought this for my wife for x-mas to replace a cheap one cup chopper. and she say's this cuisinart works much better then her old one cup, but you do have to learn it,cause it does much more but its not hard to learn."
4,great unit,"Been using our original 30 yr old Cuisinart for mostly chopping and slicing. Visiting my daughter who had received one of these as a wedding gift, I used it and liked the size and efficiency of this unit and ordered one. I like it so much we bought another as a wedding gift for another couple."
4,"mince well, not chop","It can mince very very well, but the chopping function (pulse button) results similar to mincing. Works well so far."
5,An excellent little machine,"Since there's only 2 of us these days, the smaller food processor is our best choice. This little machine is excellent. I love it."
5,Love My Cuisinart Handy Prep!,It is exactly what I needed for small tasks in my kitchen. My only question is why I didn't buy it before this!
2,Junk.,"All I really needed this to do was to chop vegetables (Peppers,carrots,tomatoes,etc.) and it couldn't even do that. Everything it chopped it chopped unevenly.It would nearly liquefy some things or chop other things so unevenly that I just had to go back to chopping with a knife. A waste of my money."
4,It will last. Will we use it much?,"The concept is good and it is well executed: A smaller, sturdy version of the time-saving larger food processor. Big food processors make sense because they save a tremendous amount of time doing boring and tiring routines of chopping and slicing for large quantity output. If you are just preparing for for yourself and your partner, the time saved may not be enough to make you get in the habit of using it. That is what I am noticing. For just the two of us, hand slicing and chopping is fast enough and easier to clean up; plan a party however, and out it comes. And make no mistake: this little unit can do a big job easily. I suspect this unit will last 30 years or more."
3,Not a substitute for a full sized processor,"I was a little broken hearted when I opened the box for this food processor. It seemed perfect till I saw the max liquid fill line. It's really low. Product is just as it is described, a prep processor. Don't buy it if you want to puree sauces and soups. Waay too small. I am returning it for a full sized processor."
1,Very DIssapointed,"I purchased this food processor to do smaller jobs. I have used it twice. The first time to simply grate cheese. Simple task, it almost burned the motor out. The second time I was make a dip. The chopping blade is now stuck in the processing bowl. I have the larger 11 cup processor and am very satisified. Much easier to use and even though it costs more, it has been money well spent. I am in the process of sending this back to cuisinart (not to be replaced)."
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this for small jobs, I wanted to make small batches of dough for desserts, I wanted to make sorbet mix, and I wanted to make salsa, I tried all three and it failed on all three counts, it did not bring any of the dough together no matter what I did, the watermelon sorbet mix went up inside the blade from beneath and spilled out of the hole in the center all over my counter top, and the same happened to my salsa.I was completely disappointed by the poor quality and design of this and sent it back and I must give it a very poor rating for my very poor experience with it."
1,Big Let Down.,Got this food processor as a Christmas Gift and used it roughly 5 times before the motor went out. I thought it worked fine for the five times I got to use it except there was really only one speed and I probably could've used a bigger one. You're better off spending a little more and getting a better quality one.
3,Cuisinart handi prep mini food processor,This little cuisinart food processor works ok but not great.Can only put a few cookies in at a time and leaves chunks whole.A waste of time and money. For what I am using for the salad shooter worksmuch better and much simpler clean up.
5,"Terrific Buy, Great Product","We already had a Waring commercial food processor for big jobs and wanted a smaller food processor built of the same quality. The Cuisinart DFP-3 Handy Prep is the best around ... and, yes, of substantially better quality than a Cusinart of the same size that's sold at Costco for just a few more bucks.Important, too, the vendor was top-knotch."
1,"DON""T BUY - 2 1/2 Month Follow-up - No Longer Works","When I bought this in April I thought this was the greatest tool. However, I have owned it for only 2 1/2 months (only used it about 4 times) and now it no longer works at all. Also, I just learned that it is already outside of the return window....Don't waste your money. This cost about $15 per use (short duration)."
3,Average Food Processor,"This works alright. I bought this as a gift for my parents. I own the 7 cup model. The difference is that this model has a lot of plastic in it's parts. The shredding disc is made up of plastic except for tiny part that does the shredding, while the 7 cup model the entire disc is made of metal. While shredding cheese the disc will stop if you push down too hard on the cheese when your feeding it into the processor. This works alright for certain things but the 7 cup model is so much better."
2,Plenty room for improvement.,"Very good concept. Very cheap cutting and shredding elements, shabbily made without any precision. As one reviewer here noticed ""it pulverizes"" meat and vegetables instead of cutting and shredding.Would not buy it again. It does not look Cuisinart, it does not cut Cuisinart."
2,Shredding,"I've had this item for about 2 years now. Don't care for the shredding blade. Not enough holes and they are only on one little portion of the blade. The rest of the blade is solid plastic. Cheese, zucchini, whatever, get stuck between plastic and top of processor. Slicing blade is set up the same way. Would prefer a shredding blade with holes all the way around."
5,Lived up to the hype,"I've heard so much about the Cuisinart food processors. Living alone and working a lot of hours, it's sometimes easier to grab something quick (aka unhealthy) than come home and chop up vegetables, etc. So, I decided to try this small one because it was inexpensive, compared to the other models. Plus, it had slicer and shredder blades.I LOVE IT! I made spanikopita in about 15 minutes, start to oven. The spinach was chopped so quickly! I sliced a bunch of peppers and onions in just a few minutes and froze them in small packages for easy weekday cooking. It cleans up easy, too. Mushrooms, lemons, zucchini, etc - poof, done! It's powerful!My only criticism is that I wish I could order more blades. The slicing disc cuts in pretty thin slices so I wish I could order a medium thickness blade. But, the thin cut veggies cook fast which fits with my goal of quick, healthy cooking so it's fine."
5,Amazing food processor - I would pay three times this price!,"My husband has had to consume only liquids for the past month (and we still have 3 more weeks to go) because his jaw is wired shut after having surgery done. This food processor is such an incredible blessing. I've been able to process soups, smoothies, juices, etc. SO easily. I actually look forward to using it everyday, multiple times a day. It is extremely powerful, effective, efficient, and fun to use. The set-up and clean-up couldn't be easier. I will continue using this food processor daily even after my husband is off the liquid diet. It's great for quickly making salsas, slicing up food bits, or making delicious milkshakes or smoothies. HIGHLY recommended! I can't wait to gift this item to friends/family as well!"
5,Would you recommend this for makng baby food?,"I am looking for a smaller, easy to clean and easy to use food processor for making homemade baby food. I have a blender but think that is too bulky and not excactly what I want. I want something that chops the food up smoothly. Does anyone recommend this processor to do a good job at making the baby food?"
4,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"""Dreaming Of Gwen Stefani"" exceeded all of my expectations. At first, I must admit, I wasn't too keen on reading it. But once you get started, it's hard to put it down. I especially like the way the author explores all the superficiality (if that's a word) that we tend to get so overly absorbed in. This book is not one to be judged by its cover and it really is a great book. It also doesn't hurt that it is pretty funny as well."
4,Hot dog king at Papaya Queen,"Sometimes a hotdog is only a hotdog, and in Evan Mandery's novel, Mortimer Talyor Coleridge's love for Gwen Stefani seems pure, if totally over-the-top. Although one can never be too sure! Still, this novel is fun with lots of wry smiles for the reader, and a few ""laugh out loud"" snorts as well."
2,"Love Gwen, disliked the book","I really didn't like this book at all. Perhaps this book would have seemed better to me if i hadn't already read A confederacy of Dunces, but either way it just seemed like a waste of time. The title makes you think the book will be about Gwen Stefani, but it turns out to be heavily filled with the subject of hotdogs."
5,Amazing Lyricist,She has an amazing ability to turn phrases and cut to the reality of being in love and being a person.
3,"Of course it's good, but you can do better","If you're one of the many newly emerging Aimee Mann fans, or if you've heard about her and are just curious, please accept some advice from a long time fan: Back up, find Aimee's debut album ""Whatever"", and buy it immediately (if not sooner). It has become very trendy to rave about ""I'm With Stupid"", which was her second solo work, -- and don't get me wrong, it's a good record -- but if you want Aimee Mann at her very best, then you want ""Whatever."" Producer Jon Brion is the key to the puzzle. ""Bachelor No. 2"" and ""Magnolia"" both contain the same biting lyrics and catchy singability that have become Mann trademarks, but neither features Jon Brion in the full time capacity of producer (although he does contribute a bit of his own music to ""Magnolia""). ""Bachelor No. 2"" will not disappoint, but do not be mistaken...""Whatever"" is one of the best records, front to back, of the past decade. It's that good. Check it out."
5,blissful melodies,how to fully appreciate the undulating enchanting music that bachelor No. 2 creates.1. go into a darkened room. 2. find a soft quiet place to lie down. 3. turn on the c.d. 4. let the magic of this album permeate your sub-conscious mind. 5. repeat step 3 & 4 6. repeat 7. repeat 8. repeat until your maker calls you!
4,Super good songwriting,"This record is a good example of how to make a record that people will come back to again and again. This isn't some fad sound of today gimmick - it could have been made anytime since 1966. It is the dictionary definition of timeless. Good songs, beautifully played and sung never go out of fashion. Sadly they hardly ever go into fashion. There are a number of artists today in Aimee's mold that are ignored or hardly noticed - her husband Michael Penn, Neil Finn, Jason Falkner, Crowd Scene, The Loud Family, Patti Romsey, Emm Gryner, many more. Buy this CD. You'll thank me."
4,Extraordinary,"Wait a minute. Aimee Mann is happily married now, to singer/songwriter Michael Penn. So why then is she still writing a whole album of songs about failed relationships and how miserable it is to be in love? Whatever the reason, I'm glad she hasn't gone all happy on us, because Mann writes despair and heartache wonderfully. Managing to capture the essence of these feelings without lapsing into cliche is a great trick and Aimee does it to perfection on Bachelor #2. The music is generally pretty mellow with a few punchy number to break things up, but with Aimee Mann it is all about lyrics and melody. Extraordinary melodies carry her well-wrought lyrics to emotional heights that lesser songwriters can only imagine."
5,"How is she different, indeed....","Aimee Mann is a singer/songwriter in a class with Neil Finn or Paul Westerberg. In a decade, one hit wonders will be contributing to a tribute album of her music. Her songs are flawlessly spun tales with affecting hooks. ""Bachelor Number 2"" boasts 13 outstanding tracks and renders obsolete her soundtrack to ""Magnolia."" This is the best CD I've bought in more than a year, and I want all of my friends to have a copy. Discover the best kept secret in pop music."
3,Trying Too Hard Here,"I'm really trying here. I bought Lost in Space, which I really do prefer to this CD and even got the TT compliation and then I got this CD out again which someone gave me. I have listened to it on the speakers and on the headphones and in the car. Either I am defective or there just is not really anything here to really hold on to. Pleasant enough to listen to as backround music as it is always slow, only the lyrics stand out as actually worth listening to and after once you really just think poor little Aimee. . . Nice packaging without landfill busting plastic - I am really trying. Makes Lost in Space look alot better. No pictures of Aimee anywhere on it - that's good and bad. Bottom line - save your money unless you are a great devotee."
2,Yawn.,This is my first Aimee Mann album and I bought it largely on the reviews I have read here.All the songs sound the same.
2,Her songs exhibit an excellent voice who is betrayed by the quality of these songs.,"I am pretty sure that Ms. Mann considers her lyrics/songs on Bachelor No.2 to be profound and poetic, but in reality her songs are relentlessly repetitious and simplistically negative, not to mention virulently and bluntly anti-male. She really needs to listen to the songs of Mindy Smith and Patty Griffin to get a handle on how to write songs.Ms. Mann has a lovely voice and her Christmas album is good and even brilliant at times. But this album buries emotions, truth, love, hate, sorrow, hurt etc under a mountain of negativity.I understand that Ms. Mann has quite an assertive and strong personality who fights record companies and probably anyone else who disagrees with her. Nevertheless, she should take some advice and start singing songs written by other writers--her lovely voice is betrayed by the mediocrity of her own songs."
1,the best of the cathedrals,"When someone buys a musical DVD, one expects music. This DVD is typical Gaither -- plenty of talk which becomes tiresome on subsequent replays. This DVD focuses on George Younce -- almost to the exclusion of others. The Gaither production is choppy with one-second focuses on the performers interspersed with many focuses on his typical crowd of non-performing friends. The background is cluttered making it difficult to concentrate on the performers. This all being said, I do really like to hear George Younce sing. It's a shame Gaither inserts himself in conversations with Younce for much of the DVD. I like Gaither, too, but enough is enough."
3,Good enough...!,"Folks here have covered the good bits, and just to reiterate - this lappie does get boiling hot, and can burn legs, especially if you're hammering the graphics by playing, say, World of Warcraft.Secondly, the keyboard is super clattery and *loud*. If you're a blogger, and you like to type during conference talks, sometimes you will get shushed. That's really annoying.My vaio shipped with the Bluetooth gremlin toggled off, so I had to get that fixed shortly after getting it out of the box; also, hibernate is indeed dodgy: it won't work if you have the graphics set to 'speedy' rather than 'stamina'.Otherwise, I'm happy enough. It's light, sleek, and does the job."
3,No a worth !!,"It is a lightweight computer , the design is really good .But do not waste USD 2149,00 as I paid for . I always had toshiba , a toshiba with the same configuration will cost USD 1200,00 . Of course it weights a little bit more . But doens't compense pay more for it . The battery take about 4 hours to get charged . Toshiba take 1 1/2 . The A/C Charger is also bigger than toshiba . I used to have a Toshiba Core Duo T5500 with 2 giga RAM , and 256 video card SHARED . And I can tell you that toshiba runs faster . Sony even with hibrid memory video and best processor ( 2,00 X 1,66-TOSHIBA ) , run a little bit slower . Toshiba come with a DVD recovery . Sony not ! The question is .... Sony weight 3,7 toshiba weight 5,0 . If you don't need lightweight buy toshiba . Sony also doesen't have a separate buttom to control volume . You have to do it on the keyboard . All right .. That's it ...."
2,Doesn't Deserve the Hype,"I purchased Max and the Cats after recommendations from my World Literature professor, and was thoroughly disappointed. Not only is this story dry, it is poorly written; especially in comparison to other works by Scliar. Pick up Centaur in the Garden instead."
3,Max and the Cats--confusing,"I bought this book after I learned that the author of Life of Pi was inspired to write his novel after reading Max and the Cats. The books was interesting, but I doubt the author's purpose and the theme. I thought maybe the main character had become paranoid. He seemed crazy, almost obsessed. The book flowed well and the characterization about his father was nicely developed, but I was hoping to find an underlying message and I didn't get that."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"How can a book with such a beautiful alluring cover be so horrible? I'm sorry to say it, but this book was one of the worst books I've ever read. When I finished reading it, I had this sick upset feeling in my stomach. I wasn't sure whether I should scream or cry. Although I did neither, reading this book, I'm sorry to say, was a dreadful experience. The part about the jaguar in the dinghy was cool but the ending was terrible. I was disgusted that the main character was mean enough to split an innocent dog's head open for absolutely no reason. I also hate the name Max. You could have picked a better name. Although, you have taught me one lesson; don't judge a book a by its cover. Even a book with a great cover could be awful."
4,Interesting and fun,"Another Dover Little Book. This one has ten designs, dinosaurs and prehistoric reptiles. My favorite is the tiger-striped Kronosaurus, a marine reptile. There's no accompanying information on the creatures, but the pictures and the price more than make up for it, and sparked my cousins into learning more about them on their own. I got a copy of these tattoos for myself, too. The depictions include Triceratops, Quetzalcoatlus (a flyer), Spinosaurus, Iguanodon, Ornithomimus, Polacanthus, Deinonychus, and the popular Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor."
2,Fortune miss...,"Wow, I know it was a mistake to buy this in the first place, but it was cheap and I thought it would be interesting to see it work. WRONG, it moves in your hand but only due to the heat of your body. All in all, it is pretty worthless."
5,Authentic,"This is a definitly authentic performance. All Sibelius's a capella work's here, performed with correct and beautiful interpretation. And, since there is no second version available, this is the only choice of this repertoire. The record is clearly well."
4,"""Adventures"" in Paradise","While many people have travelled to islands in the South Pacific, Clyman Otis has given us a window to a very different look at paradise. Living and working for several years on the remote island of Yap, Clyman somehow manages to keep his sense of humor through all the difficulties of culture shock, Pizza Hut withdrawal and learning to live and work with the Micronesians. It would be nice to hear more from Clyman. Perhaps further adventures, or what lasting impressions his time in Micronesia left on him. Fun to read, ""Adventures in Yap"" will alter your image of an island paradise."
4,"Adventures In Yap, A Pacific Backwater",This book is a good reference for anyone considering spending any time in Micronesia. It gives a good and sometimes humorous overview of what living conditions and activities are available to anyone who choses to visit that area of the world.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can recommend it to anyone with an interest in what life is like in the more remote areas of our worl.
2,Adventures in Yap,"This little book, written for an American audience, accurately and humorously describes many details of life on Yap, the outer islands, and the transportation in between. I heard myself laughing out loud over some of the characters and situations. I wanted to read much more, the pages turned too fast, it was too short."
5,Some People Have Actually Heard of Yap,"The writer's humor of his experience on this small South Pacific island is a real treat. The island jumping in a small, local plane, the roaches taking up residence with him, his description of the rain and island lifestyle, and, well, there is much more. You'll enjoy the pictures and wish you were there. Oh, and there was the story of the betel-nut chewing, but I don't want to write about that. After reading the book, I asked a business acquaintance of mine if she had heard of Yap. She said yes. I was so surprised and amazed, I bought her lunch."
2,Greg Douglass--Lead Guitar,"This is one of the best instructional videos I have bought--and I have bought a lot. Greg is skilled, but he shows you simple and slow ways of making each song sound great. His style is easy to follow and he makes it fun. I have improved very noticably since I started working with Greg on this DVD. I would recommend it to anyone. Greg rocks!"
1,"To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.","We live in a building that was built by Boaz's company. He should write a book ""The Real Estate Millionaire: How to cut corners and cheat people out of their money"". It will be honest at least. Now let me tell you the rules to such a fortune: build a house with shitty leaking roof and walls, install an inappropriate sewage pump, promise a gym and then lie that someone stole equipment, do a self-audit... We are forced to pay for all repairs for the house that is only 3 years old (and had problems from the beginning). I honestly believe that this guy shouldn't be allowed to build anything. It's a shame that he even dares to write a book about real estate."
3,"Right Length, Wrong Strength","I have trouble bending to put on my shoes so I need a longer shoehorn. I found this one and ordered two, one for home and one for the office. While the length and design are ok, the metal is not strong enough to live up to the task. I bent both of them inside of a week. If I could find the same thing in stainless I'd be much happier."
4,OK for the price,I have lower back pain that keeps me from reaching down to put on socks or tie shoe. This is the third brand of long shoe horn I have used all from amazon. For the price and results this was one of the best. They all bend!!!!!!! So keep that in mind even the ones made with 16awg metal. This shoe horn is not as wide as the others I have purchased but still does a good job.
2,defective toaster,"When I put 4 pieces of bread in the toaster to be toasted, one of the pieces only gets toasted on one side of the bread."
1,Does not work as advertized by Amazon,"I bought this toaster over the others I looked at because it has a ""bagel"" setting which was said to toast just one side of the bagel while warming the other side. It does NOT do this. The ""bagel"" setting merely adjusts the toasting time to allow for thick items. Maybe older versions of the product toasted one side, but the new one I got does not. It may otherwise be a good toaster, but I don't know that yet."
1,AVOID THIS TOASTER - UNEVEN COOKING!!,"After about six months, this toaster started burning toast around the edges and now cooks one side to a crisp while leaving the other side almost un-toasted. Two thumbs down for this piece of $#!%"
4,Excellent value,"A very nice appliance that does what it's supposed to w/ few compications. Simple, clean design."
4,Toast Master,"We had a B & D toaster that was new but took forever to toast the bread. We bought this toaster based solely on the claim to toast faster. IT DOES! Four slices for when you need a lot quick. It toasts even, adjusts to a variety of thicknesses and/or accomodates bagels. The shade of toast dial is easy to read and the cleaning tray is convenient for easy cleaning. If you want fast toast that is evenly browned, this is your toaster."
3,Cuisinart toaster: the good & the bad,"This toaster lasted 13 months then one morning the right side sparked and stopped working. I called Cuisinart and spoke to a most unhelpful person who called herself Daphne whose main goal seemed to be to get me off the phone. To achieve this she even gave me information I strongly felt was erroneous. Eventually I thought of calling back. Which I did and spoke to a very helpful person called Craig who explained the returns process accurately and in detail. (Daphne was wrong.)I had to pay to return the broken toaster and pay to receive the new one, total $15.50. Considering the cost of a new one I went ahead with it. When I received the new one it came with a notice that it is only guaranteed for the length of the original warrantee which is a bit strange. If it's brand new why shouldn't it have a full warrantee of its own?"
4,Toaster settings are poorly designed,Toaster works well and the quality is great. The only issue I have are the setting indicators located on the front of the toaster are difficult to view. If you are standing up you cannot view the settings. They are set back too far and not readable unless you bend down and look directly at the window settings.
4,Gets the Job Done!,Nice looking and good size.Makes evenly toasted sides of the bread.Four slices at one time is a HUGE time saver.Works great for English Muffins too.Like the feature of being able to bring toasted item above the level of the opening.Easy to remove toasted food.Overall very satisfied.
2,Not very reliable,"We purchased this toaster a couple of years ago. The first one failed (one side not working) in the first 6 months. Received a replacement and 12 months later, it now only toasts on one side.I would not recommend this model."
1,I'm Giving Up on Cuisinart...,"I've returned two of these toasters, purchased new, in the past week. The first bread toasted fine; the next four uses produced increasingly poor results. I took that one back in hopes that it would prove an aberration! Unfortunately on the first use, the second toaster browned one side of the bread and not the other. Hoping this may have been a ""break-in"" issue, I toasted another two pieces of bread; they only browned around the edges. The third attempt didn't even produce enough heat to dry out the bread. Additionally in the week before I purchased these, I had to return a four slice Cuisinart Custom Control to Amazon due to malfunctioning and design defects. (Amazon was wonderful, by the way!) So after three attempts at Cuisinart, I'm giving up. It seems their products are increasing poorly made and are not worth the premium dollars. Look elsewhere..."
3,OK Toaster,"While I love the features for this toaster: 9 toasting settings, a cancel button, reheat, bagel, and defrost buttons - it only toasted evenly for a couple of months. (and not on the ""bagel"" feature). Waffles come out toasted in the middle and soggy on the edges. Toast comes out light on one side and a dark on the other."
1,THIS THING IS TOAST!,"Seemed like a good buy when I bought it. Upscale price for a toaster but it had so many features it seemed fair. But my gosh - it can't make a decent piece of toast! It overtoasts everything or undertoasts it so that you have to put it back down at which point it.....overtoasts it!Nice idea having wide slices but it doesn't handle large slices nicely, breaking some on the way up - probably because of undertoasting.After only a week or so - this thing is toast - I plugged in my old style 4 slice B&D; - oh well!"
1,The item broke the same night,"This is a cheap quality product. We bought it in local BB&B; and the first time we turned it on it started to smell like burning plastic. Next, 2 minutes later, the plastic on the lift broke.The only plus, we could have 2 types of toast: slightly brown, and deep brown."
1,What Happened to Cuisinart?,"We've limped along with this toaster for about 3 years now, but it really stopped toastingproperly about a month after we purchased it. Hope springs eternal...this is the secondCuisinart toaster we've owned and the previous one did the same thing. I've always likedCuisinart products and I thought, perhaps, the first one was a lemon and I'dgive it another chance. However, it toasts on one side (NOT on bagel setting) on three ofthe four toaster slots. The fourth just gave up. I will not buy another Cuisinart toasterand do not recommend it."
1,Defective Toaster 2 Times - Do Not Buy!!!!!,"I bought the toaster thinking that since it's made by Cuisinart, it must be good. Makes sense,right? So I got the toaster and the right side didn't work. I could put it on the highest setting possible and it still wouldn't toast. I tried everything and thought, well, I must have received a bad one. So I got another one - same brand - and this time the toast wouldn't pop back up! It stayed stuck down in the toast position and could have kept going if I wasn't there to pull the toast out. Unbelievable! So unless you really want to throw money away at something that doesn't work and could even be a fire hazard, please don't bother with this one!"
1,One Side Toaster,"This toaster toasts unevenly. In a couple slots the toast doesn't even brown on one side. Unless you like bread that's toasted on only one side, don't buy this toaster."
5,Greatest purchase,"Since purchasing this toatster, I haven't looked back. Works well, makes solid toast and after using other toasters that made my toast come out black, i can say that i am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who likes eating good toast, english muffins and even pita bread!Great buy, overall has exceeded my expectations! Very pleased."
2,Cuisinart let me down,"I liked the style and the brand name when I purchased this last year.It toasted unevenly since the beginning, but I could live with that. Now the lever that pushes the bread down will not work (it won't stay down) I now have to purchase another and will switch to another brand. I just discovered these reviews a few months ago, so maybe I can be more informed when I buy another toaster."
4,I hope the second lasts longer than the first,I bought this to replace a broken one of the same make. I like the style. The 2 separate controls are nice with the separate setting for each side. Bagels are handled easily in this. I think my first one should have lasted longer however. I am the only user and it did not work properly after about 1.5 years. I would have to hold the switch down or the bread would keep popping up.
3,pretty similar to a $20 toaster,"One side of the toaster browned a lot more on one side of the bread than the other. The other side was closer, but not always consistent. After about 4-5 months of use one side of the toaster became broken and the toast wouldnt stay down.I'm pretty disappointed, I did expect either long life or good toast from something that cost 3x as much as my last toaster"
5,Works well,I can't take large pills so I've been buying this liquid glucosamine and using it for a while now. I take it with my juice in the mornings and it does seem to help with my knee joints. My husband has started taking it too to help with his backaches.
4,Great Job--BUT,"I used this in PT and thought that there could not be a better product. Mine was the 9"" x 24"". However, after using it for 3 years the gel foam lumped up to about the size of a soccer ball. Naturally, It wouldn't stay on my knee. I called the company and was told that moisture must have gotten into the plastic bag one is to keep it in, while in the freezer. I thought that I was very careful when storing it but evidently, I was not careful enough. There is no way to fix it so I cannot wrap it around my knee anymore because it is one big lump. It does do a great job when in proper condition. Would I buy another one? Probably, but maybe one that is smaller and easier to handle."
5,Great pain relief where there's a microwave!,"I have chronic back,neck and shoulder pain and the Elasto-Gel products are the best for retaining moist heat and my previous wraps lasted for 6 years and I microwave them 3-4 times a day. I use this wrap for my back mostly. Sometimes my left thigh.I highly recommend this brand. I have bought other brands in the past and they don't last as long and they're not gel. The gel provides cushion."
5,Cold Wrap for Injuries,This product has helped both me & my husband over the last 6 months. I bought 2 more because this Gel maintained it's cold for nearly 30' & it is much easier than using an ice bag for injuries.
2,Elastogel 9/24,"Size is good, but the outer shell is flimsy and the inter cooling pad falls out continuously. Very poor design. I would not purchase again.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOJGB0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Not so cold,"This is a great product idea but unfortunately, doesn't live up to expectation. It doesn't stay cold for very long at all."
3,adequate,"It's okay... nothing fancy. Adequate, does a good job, except not so well in really cold weather because of the lack of humidity in the air (my current problem). So, I'm getting a stickier rosin. It is definitely worth its price, although it may not be worth the cost of shipping."
1,Just a quick fix!,"I tried this product for my tortoise who couldn't open one eye. I kept trying it and nothing was working. I finally took him to the vet, and it turns out that he has the reptile version of pink eye and needs antibiodics. The reason I say I hate this stuff is that it gives reptile owners the idea that they can get away with not taking their tortoises to the vet, perhaps because of the expense. If you really love your pet, give him a fighting chance and take him to a professional. Don't try to put a bandaid on a broken leg."
5,Great Book!,"Life's Spices from Seasoned Sistahs is an inspirational book for both females and males. Its uplifting stories from the the 60 plus women who contributed to the novel bring the reader happiness, sadness, and even laughter throughout the journey of reading. Every story included in this book has its unique way of telling their journey. Myself being a male, I would highly recommend this book to anyone willing to read it. I had a blast the entire time I was reading it and would not hesitate to read it again. Great Book!!!"
5,Groundbreaking DVD,The Killing of JFK is an important moment in history - but what always puzzled me was why the government promoted an explanation which was so obviously false and why the media continue to promote an explanation that clearly can not be true. This DVD interview with James Files is devastating - it presents in shocking detail the hidden truth behind the assassination. Its remarkable that this man is still alive. The evidence he gives cross checks with other proven facts and puts the lie to the official explanation. To understand America today you need to understand the assassination of JFK and this remarkable interview with James Files reveals the truth behind JFK's assassination in a way which is both shocking and essential.
2,Mainly Bunk,"I just don't believe Files story, it's not worth the time or money. Skip it. JFK and the Unspeakable - Why He Died & Why It Matters by James Douglass ( Orbis Press, Maryknoll, N.Y.) is a much better book."
1,James Files the FRAUD,"James Files is a fraud. Wim Dankbaar is in it for the money. He also promotes another fraud theory that Chauncey Holt is one of the 3 tramps. This type of disinformation makes it more difficult for those seeking the truth. While his website may have some accurate information on it I now suspect all the info on his site.I purchased all the James Files Videos and I've reviewed all that was said. He is BS through and through.Also, see the website citizens for justice as they have sued him.The CIA was behind the assassination and there were multiple shooters HOWEVER, James Files was not one of them."
5,Missing link found,"I have studied the JFK assasination for over 30 years and have read atleast 50 books and after each I still did not see the real picture. This book names the missing link in this murder and ties the cia and mafia together in a loose partnership by members of each to accomplish the task at hand. You will read why he is killed, and who the shooting team was. The man behind the grassy knoll finally talks and you got to listen. you will understand why Oswald was the patsy and what he was doing the week of the shooting. This is a must read book by anyone remotely interested in the assassination that changed American politics."
5,wim dankbaar's jfk book and dvd's,"regardless of what you believe about the jfk assassination i think that anyone interested in the subject should read wim danbaar's book about james files and others claiming to have been part of the jfk assassination.this book and mr. dankbaar's dvd's available at his website, [...], provide interesting detailed alternate perspectives about the assassination not found anywhere else to my knowledge.i am not an expert jfk assassination researcher but have read many of the books and other related materials, lone nut shooter and conspiracy, written since the assassination beginning with josiah thompson's six seconds in dallas when it was originally published which have provided me with some familiarity about the subject.with that background i found the james files book a very interesting read and valuable addition to the jfk literature."
2,Save your money,"If you want a picture book to leaf thru, I guess it's okay. As far as practical ideas, forget it. Most of the homes here are very site-specific, and most are multi-story. I didn't really see any innovations or adaptable ideas that I could actually use in my own home construction, which was why I bought it."
4,Great product for travelers,"It is a great product, but if you travel make sure that you buy the Reservoir. Otherwise, when fountain is empty it can become a fire hazard since it does not have the capacity to turn off automatically."
1,"Very, very noisy","This item will drive you nuts! It functions as in the picture but what they don't tell you is that it is very loud. I would never be able to have this in my house. Thank God I bought it for the office. Even there, with all the background noise of an office, it's TOOOOOOO LOUD! I do not recommend it."
1,Motor extremely noisy,"I am going to return the fountain. I haven't used it at all. Moved itfrom room to room, sat it on a towel to try to muffle the noise. The motor is so loud that it can be heard throughout the house. Have had a different styleDrinkwell fountain for two years and that motor is very, very quiet."
3,Too Noisy,"This fountain is too noisy. It may be alright in a Laundry Room, Garage, or large home. However if it is in an Apt. or Condo the motor is too loud. If in a smaller residence and there is no TV or Radio playing it can become annoying and you would not want it near a bedroom unless you closed the door or unplugged it at night or you are one of those that can sleep through anything!My old PetMate Deluxe died after several years of use and they changed the style of replacement motors so I decided to try the Drinkwell because of the Reservoir. However, there is a big difference in the noise level between the two fountains.It is also quite large .....I bought it for cats and it seems more like small dog size."
4,"Flex-a-lite 125 - 12"" Electric Puller Fan","Flex-a-lite's low-profile fan is almost everything it's advertised as. The lower bracket was slightly misaligned for proper placement of the lower radiator bolts and required minor adjustments. This fan is slightly louder than my previous OEM fan for my 1994 Honda Civic EX. For the increased space and air flow, I can deal with the slightly increased volume. The electrical connector, is 100% plug-and-play as advertised. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
2,not that good,I bought this game about 5 years ago. To be honest i didnt really like it. POkemon platinum is way better. Again i have had platinum for about 5 years now and the differences are huge. There are alot less pokemon in diamond and it affects the whole game. From what i remember one of the guys from the elite 4 works with fire types. He has a steelix and a driftblim with him and they are not even fire type. The 8 gym leader works with electric types and he has a lopbunny with him (lopbunny is a normal type). Im pretty sure that there are other things like this with other gym leaders . Pokemon platinum has about 150 more pokemon than Diamond and pearl. Also there are more legendarys in platinum. Overall i did not like this game alot.Remember to get POKEMON PLATINUM. Diamond is alot like pearl and eveything about them is about the same(i have played both) Pokemon Platinum was a much more better game and is much more exiting.
1,Major disappointment!,"Oh, how I wish I had carefully read all the reviews here! But my son had some birthday money and wanted a new pokemon game, and I let him choose this one. It just arrived and now my daughter is in tears. There is only file allowed, so my daugher will basically never be able to play this game because her doing so will delete my son's game. NONE of our other ds games do that! I'm never buying another pokemon ds game! If you have more than one child who might want to play this game, beware."
5,Nice Game,The game is filled with hours and hours of gameplay. This is why I bought it because i knew that with my schedule it would take me a very long time to finish it.
4,Pokemon Diamond,"I love pokemon. Great game. Alot of fun and very addicting. I just wish they would make a game like this for the bigger systems. One that you can actually go and catch pokemon like on the TV show. Until they get smart enough to do that, I will continue to have fun with what they have out."
4,Grandson's favorite game,"I ordered this game for my grandson for his 11th birthday. He was so excited to get it and has not put it down except to do homework, bathe, and go to school. He now wants the Pearl version as well, so guess I will be ordering it for Christmas."
4,Game is great.,"I love Pokemon and have since I was a little kid. This game is no exception. Diamond is awesome from the start and continues to remind me of why I love Pokemon. Not my favorite generation though, but an excellent addition to my DS collection."
3,Addictive Fun,"I bought this for my 9 year old son. Also bought the Pearl edition for my 7 year old daughter. They share a Nintendo DS and are constantly fighting to use it. Each session has to be time-limited, and they act like they're going through withdrawls when they are not playing. But they have to ""earn"" playing time through chores and good behavior, which balances out all that fun.They enjoy talking strategy and comparing the Pokemon they've caught or battled. They've also made it clear that they can trade their Pokemon with each other if they BOTH have a DS. Hmmm...Anyway, if you don't mind your kids being addicted to a good, clean, non-violent video game (like we were), this appears to be the ultimate for now."
2,Boring.,"In my opinion, I found this game VERY boring... I really don't like most of the new pokemon (i mean, have you seen Comby?! Come on!!!) and my favorite pokemon, munchlax, took WAY too much boring waiting to get. I was never a fan of the pokemon games anyway (with the exeption of the Mystery Dungeon games, i love those). All you do is go around battling pokemon and catching new ones. Training is boring, battling is boring, and putting so much waiting to find rare pokemon is just...... boring. And it was much too easy to catch pokemon... I cought the all-powerful legendary pokemon, Dialga (the pokemon on the cover of the game), with an ordinary pokeball. I'm not even kidding! I weakened it, then threw a pokeball... and it caught it. If you liked the old games of just wandering around catching pokemon, you will probably like this too, though."
4,Pokemon Diamond Version,This product is a great buy. I recommend it to all those fans who like these adventure type video games.
5,What I don't like about this game,"My son has this game. These are his complaints. You can't catch Palkia in Diamond Version. He doesn't like how Mespirit and Cresselia can flee even if they are sleeping, paralized, etc. and if your Pokemon has arena trap for a pokepower. I guess the bad things don't out weigh the good things because he wants to play the game pretty often. And he really likes Dialga."
4,Kids are happy to have it on the DS,"The kids have several versions of the GBA cartridges that they play on the DS and are delighted to have a DS version so that they can play each other natively.Only two things I can offer as cons: D & P are hard to discern among non-experts. The user uploaded images show a special Dialga/Palkia stylus for each version. Perhaps these were included in a limited edition release or sold separately, but the two I purchased recently did NOT come with it, so don't expect, or better yet, DON'T SHOW THE KIDS THIS PICTURE... you've been warned ;)"
3,Not English,My son bought this game. Waited over a month to receive item not sure why. Until I received it...it was not in English. He had opened and played the game before he told me that the game was in German (he thinks). I tried going back to the listing to see if we missed something but can not see where anything was stated about the game not in English. Sellers please make sure you are putting this information in the listing.
4,Pokemon-Diamond Version Nintendo DS,I like this game cause i can start out with the cute pokemon Chimchar plus the tv's in each ownwers house flicker as if alive unlike the Pokemon Soul Silver Version. Kicken Team Galitic butts feels good. Plus your a boy or girl starts watching a brief desciption upon there tv before they start on their quest. Your rival is actually your friend unlike Pokemon soul silver/earlier editions that's why I rate this pokemon nintendo ds divamond Version a 4 out of 5 rating.
5,Best Game Ever!!!,Pokemon Diamond is the best Pokemon game I've ever played!I love the Pokemon Infernape.
5,Good Game,"Its worth the 34 dollars because its tons of fun, theres so much to do and it takes a very long time to beat ive been playing 48 hours and i just got to the pokemon league"
3,"Excellent Performers, Great Concept, but...","...and maybe I won't be the only one saying this, they should have just filmed the entire concert with very few breaks in continuity and *then* the 'spend a day with each member of B2K'interviews (those interviews are strictly for the lil girl fans, anyhoo). It also would have been nice to put a coupla of their music videos here. The concert scenes that were given showed the fellas very entertaining and charismatic on stage. And like I've said in an earlier review, these lil dudes can step! And your daughter just may make these guys as big as Boys II or N Sync..."
2,Not worth the money,"The design of the back interface for the existing wall plate is poor. I needed to make minor modifications to the plastic so that it would fit on a standard metal wall plate. The design of the front interface for the telephone is very poor. My telephone did not fit on it without making major modifications to the plastic front interface. I looked all over for a different aDSL wall mount for my telephone, but when I could not find one, I made the modifications."
4,good action figure,"this toy is a good action figure, but of course it doesn't do much else. It's up to your child and their imagination, which is not necessarily a bad thing."
4,Surprisingly good Polanski-esque horror film,"This Spanish film was made not long after the demise of Franco, when censorship loosened up in Spain considerably. My sense is that this was basically intended as an exploitation flick, but the filmmakers had talent and imagination, and the result is a low-budget horror gem. Very well directed, replete with a sinister atmosphere reminiscent of Polanski films like THE TENANT and ROSEMARY'S BABY and some genuinely strange and creepy touches. A good horror film for viewers with brains and imagination."
3,satans blood I liked It,a good movie. It. was. interesting a plus for. any. collection the filming. was good. not cheeply. made. with. a lot. of interesting twist
1,"Don't expect too much, unless you're looking for satanic orgies and bad acting.","""Satan's Blood"" definitely has that foreign movie feel to it, but it really doesn't have much to offer except a lot of full frontal nudity, some odd Satanic sex scenes, and a poor attempt at a horror movie. This movie is not scary at all, but it does give you a look at an interpretation of the disgusting satanic rituals. The acting is predictably poor and the English dubbing isn't very convincing for sure. Overall, this is a very lackluster horror flick, notwithstanding when and where it was made. Of course, with a horror movie about satanism from Spain made in 1977, what should I expect? That being said, it's definitely not my cup of tea...thank goodness for ebay!"
1,a bad ballet,"Don Quixote is my favorite ballet. I have seen about 20 different productions (and some of them - dozens of times) - this is the worst. Pavlova is a super ballerina but she is alone in this falsified Bolshoi production. It is not the Bolshoi theater. The performance is given in some 3-rate assembly hall. The settings are of the so-called ""gastroli type"" or ""tour type"" and very bad at that. They are used when a theater is on a tour.The highest price for this disc should be $5.00 : $4.99 for Pavlova, one cent - for the rest of the ballet."
5,Wrong tracklist,Amazon.com has the wrong track list attached to this album (I have no idea what album they got those titles from). But here is the real one:1 Jesus Meu Rei (3:10)2 Com Mais de 30 (2:40)3 Garra (2:57)4 Black Is Beautiful (4:15)5 Ao Amigo Tom (1:56)6 Paz e Futebol (2:33)7 Que Bandeira (2:59)8 Wanda Vidal (2:04)9 Minha Voz Virá Do Sol da América (4:20)10 Vinte e Seis Anos de Vida Normal (2:22)11 O Cafona (3:24)12 Berenice (*) (3:01)* Bonus track available on Japanese import
5,Get ready,"Once you play it it is non stop action, and plenty of detailed information of what is a dogfight. Set some time aside for this set."
5,"Buy it...........no, just BUY IT!!!!","Excellent....what else can you say, but excellent. Any fan of military tactics, aviation history, and yes even computer games, will LOVE this series. Never before have actual events been recreated with such unbelievable detail and suspenseful drama as this. HIGHLY recommended!!! Just wish there were more shows like this coming, because I can't get enough!!!!"
3,not the best book,"this is not the best book, but it is also not the worst. i suggest you get it if you like books that are not the best and also not the worst."
1,Coasters,"This product mostly ended up as coasters since they did not burn properly, only 2 out of the 10 burned correctly. I purchased some other brands before and after these and they all burned fine."
1,Drive/Software won't even recognize a lot of these as LS,"I have an ASUS DVR Lightscribe drive and out of the 10 DVDs I was able to burn the label correctly on 1 (one) of them! Most of the others could not be recognized as lightscribe media by the drive and software. The rest burned swirls on the label surface as if there is a registration mark that is not seen correctly by the drive.I have some HP CD lightscribe media that I easily burned in between making coasters with the Memorex diskc, so I feel confident that it is the media, not the drive.Big thumbs down."
3,It works.,Just remember the disks are yellow and so the image will be yellow. It's like printing a black and white picture on paper. Print on yellow and get a yellow image. It stores fine and the images burn well. I haven't had problems.
2,ENTERTAINING AT FIRST BUT NOT SATISFYING OVERALL,"I am new to this type of ""literature"" so I wasn't sure what to expect. I have had fantasies involving dominant women, but the thought of being a ""true"" submissive, I now know after reading this book, is not very attractive, at all. I love the idea of being teased maybe even forced into certain things, but the master/slave relationship is taken to extremes; being tied up is one thing, but making Kevin, the ""protagonist,"" kiss the boots of his staff of mistresses while nude and then display his panties which he will be wearing shortly is not a turnon. The story is well written I will admit, but I got tired of the whole thing after awhile and felt like I could not tolerate the characters' ""behaviour"" before the end."
3,"Once more, a sad ending.","This is the second of Grant Antrews novel and once more we find a sad ending for our main character. We follow the life and explorations of one man under that guiding hands of a group of women. Instead of him finding his true calling in life, however, we follow him back out of the kinky world and back into the mundane existance. Perhaps he is better for his experiences under dominant hands but we are left wondering about that by novel's end. Are there no happy femdom stories out there?"
5,Domination high,"Kevin Donavan is the proof that no money can replace a devastating leather clad dominatrix. Kevin was harsly beaten , experienced all forms of torture and kept asking for more.His worst nightmare was being separate from his mistress After one week in his cell,without seeing her he would have given his life just to hear her voice. That's total ``SUBMISSIONS`` Great work Grant"
3,Biased AGainst New Owners,"From the first sentence of the boook, there is a recurring theme that ""Giant Dogs bring Giant Responsibilities."" While this is certainly good advice, it was repeated so often throughout the book that I got the impression that the author was trying to discourage readers from getting a Great Dane. He spent a lot of time discussing health issues (always the problems the dog can get)but little time discussing what to do about them. AFter reading the book, it is enough to make a prospective owner consider opting for another breed. If you read the book, balance it with information from another Great Dane book, as this one is biased against new owners."
3,Pretty basic overview,"This was an ok Dane book. I bought Great Dane: Model of Nobility and that is the best book for anyone wanting to know about Great Danes. It gives all the info you could ever want. It is out of print, but you can get it from a marketplace vendor or you can go to the author's dane website. Just google Jill Swedlow and you will find it. She has where you can print it out for free off of her site."
3,A little too general,"I got this book since we are adopting a Great Dane from a rescue. The information in the book is a little too basic for my tastes. As Great Danes has special feeding requirements and are subject to a lot of diseases (all deep-chested dogs are) I could have used more information. This is okay to give a kid or teenager to read or someone who wants a general idea about Danes, but I will be getting a more in-depth book before I get my Dane."
3,It's informative,The book has lots of info on Danes. I just thought it would be a lot bigger. It's a very thin book.
1,Miss Printed,This book has miss spellings and some of it doesn't made sence I feel as though I wasted my money and time.
4,Hardly any pictures,"I'm more of a visual learner so 4 stars is all I want to give this book. If you like to read and like making your own equipment than this is for you. I still own it, but hardly ever pick it up since it has a lack of pictures."
2,Too old,"I loved Burl Ives as a child and wanted to introduce my grandchildren to some of his songs. I didn't read the fine print on the album cover and was surprised to find that his song are only about a third of the album. The other songs are done by Danny Kaye who really can't sing, and Bing Crosby.The sound quality is poor-sounds like old scratchy records. I guess we're all spoiled by technology and I hate to say it,but I would prefer to have the songs redone by someone else and be better quality. If you like authentic,this would be a great album. If you want something to entertain the kids, get newer versions. My grandkids,ages 3&6,who love music were most unimpressed."
1,Beyond Terrible!,"Don't buy anything off this CD. I made the mistake of buying the What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy) track and instead I get some terrible karaoke version of it. Is he singing in the shower? It's completely out of sync with the music. Where's the Leonard Nimoy voice clip? Where's the awesome 1980s synth track? Absolutely dreadful, I couldn't even listen through it. If I could return this song, I would. Screw you, Cleopatra Records."
2,Don't Be Afraid??,Im not sure what this album is yet.Ive had to listen to it twice to understand and here is my diagnosis...The album title should be Dont Be Afraid 2 basically NOT..(PURE ENERGY)considering most of the songs on here are remixes of Dont Be Afraid and this does not even pay tribute to all there hard work and where insoc came from.Why not put remixes from all albums and put them on a 2 disc set and give the fans a tribute album instead of this.The only track on here i liked was the remix of walking away that's where my 2 stars come in everything else im sorry but i was disappointed i hope cleopatra can put together another compilation that doesn't focus on just 1 album.
1,"this is ""NOT"" Information Society","If I could rate a ""0"" star...I would. Stay away from this CD. Listen to Paul Robb's review. He was one of the members of INSOC. and the true sound of the band.This is Kurt Hurlands solo project and some horrible remixes of the older sutff put into one CD just to sell by the label to make a few bucks.Kurt should have never ruined the name of INSOC by using it is such vein to put out his solo project and to allow this awful label (Cleapatra) to market and tarnish it.its a shame.BTW.....to the person whom reviewd this album that said this is ""for die hard fans only"" obviously has no clue whom INSOC is or works for the label."
3,Missionary journeys,DVD on Paul's missionary journeys was quite informative. It did move along quite rapidly and at times was hard to keep up with narrative. All in all a good DVD to start a study of Paul.
1,Really awful,"This DVD is full of songs and dances and then on occasion shows a child on the potty. There is no narrative, no instructions, no story line, nothing. Just singing and dancing and then an occasional picture of a child sitting on the potty. This is no way would train a child to use the potty. Completely worthless. Even the songs are annoying. I admit I only made it thru 70% of the video before turning it off. I kept waiting to see if it got better, but it never did. Definitely not for learning how to potty train!"
4,Thström Goes International,"Joakim Thström, a rock'n'roll legend in Sweden, chocked the old with this quick (and really brilliant) turn to international top-of-the-line industrial soundscapes. But now - 1999 and 3 PLP records later - he has returned to his native language. Everybody's happy over here in Sweden, but you should ignore that and try this adventure."
5,Excellent!!,"This is a great set of speakers. These are the only one Dolby Digital Speakers avalaible in Colombia. I'm amazed with it. Because Amazon don't ship this item outside U.S. I had to buy it for 300 dollars. Even at that price this speakers are awesome. For the people living inside the us, buy the 3500 instead. They are a bit better than 2500 (Connectivity with Playstation 2, remote control)"
3,shock pen,this shock pen is cheap yet has the weight of a real pen. But if you drop it the chopper stick in there will get loose and you will have to reassemble it. But is still an awesome and hilarious gag.
3,umadbro,"It isn't the best quality build, but it works well. Batteries don't last long if you use it a lot, but are cheap to replace.Fast shipping got this +1 star, I got it 3 days after ordering."
2,Shocking Pen Review,"I would not suggest the purchase of this product as you will only get a few laughs before it starts falling apart to a useless stage. If you have the money, and you want to buy it go ahead. Maybe it's a great product and I just got a defective one, but still not a good show of product to me on their part."
5,prank,worked excellent in pranking not bent package or anything worked till batteries ran out easy to find batteries loved it
1,shocking pen,"this pen sucks i had it for one day abd it broke on me heres some advice dont get this pen, most of the time when u go to click it it doesnt even do anything if u want a really good pen that will give you a good shock go to prank place .com and get it there it is more reliabeSHOCKING PEN - Shock Prank Penand a much better pen"
1,L. A. M. E.,"By the description and pictures, I was excited to receive a pen that had the word ""Empire"" on it--to make it more believable for a gag. But when I got it in the mail, it didn't say that on it nor was it in the packaging displayed in the pictures. I was mislead and feel ripped off for paying the extra money (more than it would have cost to buy it from someone else, which I clearly should have done) because I wanted the packaging and the word ""Empire"" on it. I would strongly recommend NOT buying from this seller because of its deceitful history in the presentation of the products!!!!"
1,Electric Pen Sucks,"The pen is a pile of crap. It didn't even work for one joke. Burned $5.00. What a joke. Maybe it was 3 bucks, not sure shipping price."
1,Horrible,"This item is probably the worst item on amazon EVER. when I got the item in the mail, i was excite to open it but when I opened it and true it out, it broke and it's very flimsy. Guys never this cheap china made toy. Sucks and made out of plastic and doesn't even work. Waste of money."
1,broke after 2nd try!,"After only 2 clicks, while trying to use the pen, the plastic cracked and the pen no longer worked...shocking, NOT!!! I only give this product one star for each category, because they made me choose something...otherwise I would have given it 0 stars. Do not waste your money!"
5,So funny,I got so many people with it. For people who know you could sort of tell because the top is extreamly big. It works well because you can actuallly write with it and people fall for it even more
2,"price was great, quality has bad","some did not work right off the box, the ones that did work broke soon, got a few laughs. will not buy again"
2,broke,it broke in the first 10 minuets when i just clicked the pen ounce. i do not recommend this pen
2,worst ever!!!,i just gave it a 2 because it had fast shipping. the wiring inside was friedDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
3,ok but not forever,The pen was great it lasted about 4 hours before it exploded. personallly this is fun but not forever again fun not forever fun not forever
1,i didnt work,i was hoping for somthing good but i knew it would'nt be.i got it the first day and it didnt work changed the battery and it still didnt work
1,Buyer Beware,Item came and was not in working order. After investigating further I discovered multiple wires inside the pen were no longer sodded to their posts.
1,Don't buy,"This pen was only a dollar fifty! But it did not work , biggest Piece of crap yet! Do not waste your money!"
1,sucks,"PUSH BACKS SPACE NOW !!!!! this item sucks, does not work at all, i called the seller because the shock pens i received did not work !!!!! i got 2 free replacement, those however did not work either !!!! pure garbage !"
2,CHEEP,When I Got it it was made out of thin plastic so it snapped like a twig and when it was not broken in worked when it wonted to so i fixed it like 50 times. the item is a good learning lesson for kids spending to much money.
2,Not shocked over shocking pen.,"The pen shocked as stated, but with careful handling the top section just popped off and was not easily fixed. It no longer works."
1,Came broken,right when i get it i pranked my friend it didnt work so i opened it up and all the wires were cut and the tin was very small
1,Broken,this cheap pen comes to my house and i open it.... it was cheaply built but i just wanted to shock someone. so i finally fooled my friend and it was broken. the only person getting shocked was me on how bad it was.
4,Brings back old prankster childhood memories,"Got this for my son, took it out of packaging and wrapped it like an ordinary pen, LOL, he was pretty surprised and we had a good laugh. Ofcourse my 8 year old then realizing it was a prank pen got his mom and grandparents to write down something, and ZAP(not that old). We have had a blast with this inexpensive classic."
4,Garner at His Absolute Best,"Much has been written about this affecting made-for-TV movie based on John William Corrington's novella. However, ""Decoration Day"" (1990) serves as a testament to the understated brilliance of James Garner. The veteran actor delivers an exemplary performance as a reclusive retired judge - with strong support from Judith Ivey, Bill Cobbs, Laurence Fishburne and Emmy winner Ruby Dee. Unpretentiously directed by Robert Markowitz, who never lets the drama lapse into Hallmark sentiment. Ideal viewing for Memorial Day."
2,moovie defective,THE MOVIE WAS DEFECTIVE. WWe will continue to look for this movieWE WERE PLEASEdDBY HOW FAST COST PLUS S&H were returned.
1,Still a poor supplemental source of calcium!,"I reviewed this product before the ""improved"" version here was introduced. One plus is that Vit D was added but still a poor ca++ supplement:1. Not USP tested for actual quality (unless I missed that somewhere on the label)2. Really only 40% of the 200mg per serving is absorbed from the type of calcium used.Alas I am still looking for a kid supplement for calcium that a kid will take (my daughter also doesn't care for the fruit or choclate chews that have a citrate or carbnate calcium).I did find one called Yummi bears (?) that looked a little better....But still not exactly what I want."
3,Okay for class use-- not so good for an online class,"This book was required for an online graduate course in group dynamics. While the information is good, the layout of the material makes reading the book difficult. To their credit, the authors included lots of good group activities and assessments. However, these activities appear haphazardly in the middle of the chapters breaking up content and making it difficult to read. You have to flip several pages to get to the next section in a chapter. Plus, since this course was taken online, I never used any of the activities in class discussions/activities as the book was most likely designed to be used."
3,Overpriced guide to team players,This book was way overpriced. Most of us learned group dynamics in grade school playing on team sports. The observations were good in the book but seriously the authors must think everyone waited until college to learn this stuff. The truth is that the basics of group dynamics are learned at a very young age. The saving grace is that if you are a team player you take something good away even from a bad or poorly written book. If i ever need to cite some of these researchers i can do that. So in that regard i kept this book. I would like to have seen more practical examples in the book relating to government and everyday American life. How about something on college and Professional sports teams?
4,Good,Was in excellent condition! Wish all book came as good as this one especially because of the fact it wasn't hard cover!
3,"Good book, sticky pages","This is a very good book. The copy I received was an instructor's copy, which is not what I had ordered. That is not a big problem. The yucky problem is that some of the pages are sticky, and sometimes attached to one another as if the book had been dipped in watered down glue. Luckily, the pages do separate relatively easily without tearing. A bit gross not knowing what it is that this book was exposed to..."
2,Terrbile Quality - Definitely NOT for College Level.,"The book itself is cheaply printed - pages are very thin and the cover is flimsy as well. The content is WAY too simple for grad students. It is filled with group activities but, as another reviewer mentioned, they are placed haphazardly and make reading the content of each chapter tricky. Lots of money down the tubes on this one!"
3,Joining book review,This book was in good condition and great source of information for the class I am taking. It was great source of life information about groups and how they work effectivley and not effectivley. This reading was good. I think the book information could be a little more organized though. Seems to be scattered about at times.Angela
4,perfect,I needed this book for an online course and it was half the price on Amazon. Thanks for being there for me Amazon.
3,"Good enough quality for the price, missing a few bolts","Overall, it assembled easily, looks good and works well. The packaging was a little weak. The box was torn open and the metal parts poked through. It was missing several bolts. Shake the legs well, a few bolts were stuck inside.I ended up having to buy some of the bolts at home depot. Not cheap..$10There is a bit of a discrepancy in the documentation. It says the max lifting weight is 1500 lbs. but when the boom is extended to maximum reach it's only capable of 500lbs. If you're removing a big block along with the transmission...get the 2ton version..I uou're just removing the engine...This is adequate. The legs fold up nicely for storage. Overall...It's good enough for a back yard mechanic. I you make a living doing this..Get better quality."
2,The original Free To Be Thin is much better.,"I bought the original Free To Be Thin back in the '90's and loved it.Recently, I purchased the All New Free To Be Thin for my daughter. In looking through it, there are quite a few differences. For one, in the first book you do count calories. In the new book, you don't. There is an added section on exercise in the new book; in the older book, exercise, while extremely important in any weight loss program, was left up to the reader. You were instructed to let God tell you what kind and when to begin it. Though the goals are the same, the approach is different. I just much preferred the original book."
3,Good info on changing your habits to change your life,"I first read this book when it came out in 1979, and thought it had an excellent approach to weight loss from a Christian perspective. My only complaint with it is the authors' comment, ""overeaters are often selfish people who look at self-denial as punishment ...."" (p.19). Most overweight people I know are so busy doing for others that they don't have time to take care of themselves. However, the book overall is very good."
4,GOTTA TELL YOU TO GO GET THIS SINLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow!!!! I don't even remember where I first heard this song...but it has been stuck in my head ever since! I just had to go out and buy the single. I wasn't too crazy about the second track...I was kind of hoping that there would have been some lyrics on that track...but it was just an instrumental club mix. I am totally in love with the song though. It's awesome!!! I might even think about buying her CD...whenever it comes to the U.S. It's an awesome song...she sorta reminds me of Brandy of Toni Braxton...so if you are fond of them, I don't think it would hurt to give Samantha Mumba a listen!"
5,Great song - but here's a better way to get it!,"The song Gotta Tell You is one of over 40 tracks on the British album Now That's What I Call Music 46 (Search for 'Now 46' in Popular Music). Like the US NOW releases, each CD contains the unedited full-length single version of the song. The CD also has very recent tracks by Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, N Sync and many more. If you like this song, and want to hear other big tracks from Europe (Samantha is Irish), this is a great way to do so."
4,Serious and difficult,"This Introduction to Koranic and classical arabic is serious work. Each chapter (40 in total) introduces 2 or 3 grammatical points. The vocabulary is very appropriate to reading the Qur'an and it is quite easy to learn it. This gives the student the nice impression of progressing fast. However, the grammar aspect is much more difficult and one should have some knowldge of it before starting the book.Be careful: the ""Key to exercises"" which should really be bought as well despite its ridiculously high price (no need of course to buy it if you have a teacher to correct you), has some disappointing mistakes, mostly (as far as I can tell as a student) due to vocabulary changes. Example lesson nine, ex. 1. ""the two women who came"" is corrected as being ""the two women you saw"" (al-mar'ataani allataani ra'aytahumaa) (Probably a confusion with the next sentence to translate ""a man you saw"".)Each chapter has a mistake like this in the ""key to exercices""."
2,Poor Red Eye performance for Canon SD630,"I am VERY dissatisfied with the red eye reduction features. There is an auto red eye reduction as well as a red eye reduction ""on"" selection. Neither of the two reduce red eye. I have taken countless pictures that would have turned out wonderful but they ALL have red eye. I am so displeased that I want to purchase another camera."
3,Can someone help me with this feature?,"I am a HUGE fan of this camera - even got my Mom to buy one. There are many features however, that I and she can't figure out. Her camera has this weird feature when you browse pictures where the pictures who up in more of a list. No idea why her camera does that.What I'm hoping someone can help with is the video record feature on my camera. For the life of this camera I've barely been able to record more than 20 seconds of video (occasionally it will work to record several minutes but that was sporadic and I've no idea why it worked then).I've tried to google to find the answer and no luck.I've set it to record at low quality and it still doesn't help.Has anyone dealt with this and figured out how to fix it?It's really frustrating. After 15-20 seconds it stops recording, says ""busy"" for several seconds and I only get little snippets of what I wanted to record.Super frustrating."
3,"3"" screen - not so excellent","With all the praise this screen and this camera have gotten, I'd like to point out something that has been missing from any review I've seen. While the screen is larger than it's 2.5"" counterparts, the pixel count is not (173,000 pixels for both). Since the pixel density is even worse than my old 2"" screen camera, I cannot tell if my pictures are in focus in my camera! I thought I had a defective unit that couldn't take sharp pictures until I uploaded them to my computer. On the computer the pictures were excellent, but you really can't tell on this low resolution LCD on the camera. I like the camera, but if I were to do it again, I'd focus more on pixel density than screen size. Otherwise you have no idea if you got a sharp picture until you upload it to the computer."
2,Auto Modes Don't Focus Clear and are Over Exposed,"Auto modes don't focus clear and are over exposed. The camera is in shaking mode 90% of the time, when not in auto mode.The video is very clear in the movie function and all other functions work good.Bottom line, My cheap digital camera takes clearer and more stable photos, it is a Gateway 5MP DC-M50. I would not buy this camera and I am disappointed I did. It costs to much money for blurry, over exposed photos and I do know how to use a camera.I hope this helped you."
4,The 3 inch screen gets the all attention.,"The main reason to purchase this camera is the large 3 inch viewing screen. The down side is the resolution is only 173K pixels so it is not as sharp and bright as most other 2.5 inch screen. This is only noticeable when you compare them side by side. Another disadvantage is you don't have an optical view to use in bright light but this is the trade off for the larger screen. Other than that the camera is well built, compact and takes very nice pictures. My only complaint is you can only imprint the date on the photographs is 'postcard mode', a low resolution mode. Maybe Canon thinks imprinting the date on photographs is for amateurs but it would be nice if they gave you the option instead of making it a useless option. I like to look at pictures on the computer and watch the passage of time. This lack of date imprinting dropped my rating from 5 to 4 stars."
5,WOW!,What an advancement over my seven year old Canon Powershot S110! Much more camera for less money! I am impressed with the video taken on this camera - believe I will leave my digital video camera at home except for times when I expect to be taking 15 minutes or more.
4,Nice camera,"I love Canon cameras. I have had only Canons so far.I think that the SD630 is great for the average person. The huge LCD has a positive and a negative side. Because of the size of the LCD you can see the picture much better. However, because it's so big it takes almost the entire back of the camera. That means: the LCD will always have some figerprints. It's almost impossible to avoid touching the LCD with your fingers.Other than that I think the SD630 is one more good camera from Canon."
4,Almost Perfect,"Excellent camera except for the delay between pressing the shutter release and actually capturing the picture. Quality of photos good-menu is intuitive with useful options-camera size is good. A fair value, Suggest a 1G memory card."
4,Canon SD630,"I purchased for trip which we took to Yellowstone National Park and Grand Canyon. Camera performed very well. I never missed a view finder. It's compact and takes terrific pictures for a ""non-expert"" as myself. Would give a 4.5 with only knock that camera provides no warning when battery is too low. You Must have a back-up battery with you when runs down. (I didn't have one on me when halfway into our hike down into Grand Canyon and missed some great opportunities. Batteries are small - just have one in your pocket. Other than this knock, it's the best digital camera I've owned."
3,Wonderful camera for people... not for dogs...,"The camera is wonderful. I will not repeat all the praises that other custormers have mentioned but I have found one downfall: my dog hates it! While I can't hear anything when I have the camera on, my dog can, and she can't stand to be anywhere near it... much less take a picture. So... if you have a dog that is a major part of your life... I warn you about this otherwise wonderful camera! (I've also tried the camera around cats, and they don't seem to mind it.)"
1,Disappointed,This deal never happened. I ordered this item and tried to contact the vendor on 2 occassions but never got a response. I cancelled the order and Amazon was very good about handling the claim and promptly refunding my money.
3,pics not good,i dont know whats the problem but pics are not coming good. may be i m not able to configure properly but even after using default setting it is not coming good. need to figure out. is thee any way i can replace that... i think there is some manufacturing defect??? not sure thou.
5,Perfect for the ladies,"I am totally enjoying my camera. I think I made the perfect choice in getting this camera. It neatly fits into my little purse and I can take it anyway with me. I was also drawn to the 3 inch LCD screen! Perfect! Also because I trust the canon name (previously owned a Powershot A70) I know what I am getting.Furthermore, downloading and transfering pictures are easy with my MAC, I dont have to think twice about what to do. Also the record feature is so clear, with great volume, I was very surprised. Additionally, even in the auto function, night shots comes out really bright and nice!Of course I am used to having more buttons to press, but I guess with a small camera, most keys are multi-fuctional.Now, whenever someone sees me using my new camera they feel the need to change theirs! Luv it!"
5,LOVE IT,"This is one of the best cameras I've ever used. It has great features, but the thing I love most about the camera is it's screen. The 630 has the largest screen of the PowerShot cameras, and also the most durable one. They made this one thicker to be more resistant to impact. I used to have the SD450, and the screen broke on that 3 times within a year and half, even when it was in the case. They still use the old screen on newer models, and I would recommend not purchasing them. Definitely go for the SD630."
5,The Camera I Reach For First,"This is my everyday camera. It is easy to configure and fits nicely in my pocket. Canon sensors provide phenomenal clarity in all lighting conditions. I also own and love my Nikon D40, but this Canon is my go anywhere, convenient, light-weight workhorse. This is my second digital elph and I will continue to purchase Canons in the point-and-shoot form factor. The lack of a viewfinder should not be a concern for anyone considering this camera. The LCD is highly detailed and very large. Looking through a viewfinder almost seems alien to me now. I love being able to compose a shot without having the camera glued to my face. Being able to see what is happening through my eyes rather than a viewfinder, while positioning the camera is a beautiful thing."
4,Zoom Zoom,"We just got our camera and have been playing around with it.. I dont know if we aren't doing the right thing but when we zoom in it gets blurry! Can anyone help fix this? Its really bad with the zoom and being that we are new to it, it could be us."
5,Incredible,"I bought this camera before vacation last year because I wanted a great camera that I could take even greater pictures with. I used it all summer and it took absolutely beautiful pictures. It went from Chicago, to Florida, and then to New York, and it took high quality, beautiful pictures at every stop. From the Beach to the City, the pictures were amazing. It's a slim and easy to handle camera, and the large 3 inch preview screen is a major plus. It's the best $250 that I've spent in a long time! I have a feeling I'm going to take many more pictures with my Canon PowerShot. I would recommend it to everyone!"
1,Disappointing,"This is my first digital camera, and I made my final decision to spend more money and buy a better camera based on all of the wonderful reviews. True, the large screen is wonderful, and I love the compact size. Close-up pictures (like single flowers) turned out beautifully. Other photos were average.The big problem is taking pictures outside in sunlight. On a bright day, the screen is nothing more than a mirror; I was simply looking into my face no matter how I turned. So....to get a picture we had to ""guess and shoot."" Then we would look at the screen in shade to see what we got. It was a big guessing game. We were on a trip, so were asked by several others to take pictures of them on their cameras. That is how I found out how wonderful an optical lens would be. This camera is useless in sunlight."
2,Not what I expected,Some of the features just plain do not work. Would never get this model again. So Sad I read so many reviews on it which praised it. But the one I got is dysfunctional. Oh well you waste money sometimes :(
1,not what i expected,"I've had a canon before and was very pleased with it, but it was old and very bulky so i decided to go for a slimmer model and purchased an sd630. Big mistake. I've taken probably around 300 pictures already and am only happy with maybe one. The pictures seem really fuzzy and blurry, just plain bad quality. I was shocked and maybe i just got a defective one because everyone else seems to love theirs. Nevertheless I don't think I'll ever purchase another Canon. I'm regretting the loss of $300 and I wish i never bought this camera. I should have gone with the Kodak I was debating, but i decided to get this one because I thought all the extra features sounded cool. I wish I had bought the Kodak."
5,AMAZING PHOTO SHOOTS,"THIS IS THE SWEETEST LITTLE CAMERA YOU COULD EVER WANT.IT'S SMALL.SMALL ENOUGH TO SLIP IN YOUR POCKET AND TAKE ANY WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.BUT.... IT'S BIGGGGG IN THE TECH DEPT. YOU CAN TAKE ANY KIND OF PICTURES-COLOR, SEPIA, NATURAL, EVEN BLACK & WHITE. YOU CAN TAKE PORTRAITS, PANORAMIC,ANY KIND OF PICTURES YOU WANT DAYLIGHT OR DARK.EVEN VIDEOS!!!WHAT MORE CAN I SAY, IF YOU NEED A NEW DIGITAL CAMERA,THIS IS THE ONE TO GET. I KNOW YOU WILL LOVE."
5,SD 630,I am very happy with this camera :) I've made over 3000 photos in last 3 months and it's working perfectly.
3,Obscure,This album is for eclectic tastes. It is interesting. The music sounds very whale-like to me. This is not something I listen to over and over again. It is more like atmosphere music.
4,Well written and moving,"After spending years in SA and living close to these stories, I had to read Pumla's book. Though I knew the stories, I was moved to tears. Had to put it down once and not read it for several weeks."
2,I personally don't favour it,"The only complement I give to these is the fact that they are super lubricated, and i love it! But on the other hand they are smaller than i expected. My solider down there is not a typical one but I have not had so much trouble with regular sized condoms as i had with these, these can't be regular can they?"
4,enchanting,"I bought this DVD because it is the only one available for this opera and I was considering going to see it at the Met this year. As noted by earlier reviewers the picture is iffy -- faded black and white, but the sound is wonderful. It is remastered with both dolby 5.1 and DTS available on the disk. I watched this DVD twice it was so enchanting. They call it a problem opera but frankly it is so lovely it should be performed more often."
3,"JANET IS BACK! BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE ""TOGETHER AGAIN"".","Janet is back, and ""Doesn't Really Matter"" is a good song- not 5 stars worth, but a good pop song....that after a few runs (20 or so) gets tired.This song does not stand the test of time like Janets previous efforts ""Miss You Much"", ""Pleasure Principle"", ""Rhythm Nation"", ""If"", etc...get the picture?Actually this song sounds a lot like ""Together Again"" from ""The Velvet Rope"". However Janet must be doing right, her public embraced this song on radio and sales making it the #1 pop song in America now 2 weeks running.However I miss those ""Control"" days....Janet when your next album comes out that it has a little more diversity then ""Doesn't Really Matter"" where it sounds like you played it safe for pop radio.Otherwise still a catchy tune."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!,"one word radiates when u hear this single in your mind and that is Boring!!!!!!! the vocal is weak the beats are played out and been done and lyrics are souless.Janet has and can do better ie the velvet rope and Janet . If u r a MAJOR janet fan and u need your fix u will enjoy this but if u want quality and passion and fun check out what Madonna,Melanie c (I turn to u is fab!),Pink and Victoria BecKham are doing these days much more interesting!"
5,All About Janet,"Janet is just off the hook, I love her and all that she does. The woman is just fantastic. She is just pure genius like her brother. There is no comparison to anyone else in the pop industry. She is just the best. ""Doesn't Really Matter"" is one of her best songs to date. I can't wait for her new album to come out. I will be the first in line to buy it. Janet is #1 and always will be."
4,Good the first million times,"Okay, I've always been a Janet Jackson fan. Afterall, besides the fact that we both are singers, we share another commonality. :)This song is really good to dance to and it has a great message. I think that it really shows that pop has grown up from the songs of my parents' youth (i.e. 'Puppy Love') to express points of view that you can love people no matter what they look like.The only bad thing about this song is that around here, it was played almost everyday more than once a day for over a year. That got pretty annoying!"
3,Great Song But So-So remixes,"At long last, Janet has finally released another single! This is actually a light hearted song by Janet proclaiming her love to someone whom other people can't accept. The moral of the song is that if you love someone, it doesn't matters what other people think. The song has a great rhythm, and is very easy to digest. However, it's sometimes quite hard to listen to what Janet is actually singing about as her voice is constantly muffled out by the music. As for the remixes, only the Jonathan Peters remix is the saving grace of the whole CD, and even then, it's not that good a remix. The least said about the other 2 remixes the better, with the Dance All Night remix being downright irritating. Let's hope that more remixes by other DJs will be released in the days to come. My overall verdict: Get the single because the song is really nice and heartwarming, but brace yourself and don't be disappointed by the so-so remixes."
1,Doesn't Matter At All- THIS IS GARBAGE!,"After reaching the pinnacle with the powerful Velvet Rope album Janet has now sunk to just another one of those no-brainer R&B acts. This song and that horrifying catastrophe known as All For You proves my statement. There are no standout sounds, no soul, and virtually no talent put into this single. The remixes don't save this garbage. Janet should team up with producer Roland Orzabal of Tears For Fears and do a techno\rock album instead of this lifeless barrel clicking music."
5,absolutely HEAVENLY!!!,"This is the most fantastic creation of Strawberry preserve I have ever encountered. I grew up eating my grandmother's homemade scones with this precious Little Scarlet Strawberry Preserve. It was always a special treat. It truly is an experience of flavor intensity. This is NOT the kind of preserves used for a PB&J! Little Scarlt needs to be the star!! For those who are ""preserve enthusiasts"" if you will, Little Scarlet is a must try...if only once. The price is a bit of a shock to say the least, but it truly is worth it. The Little Scarlet is a rare and precious crop. Enjoy it. Feel special while you eat it. The Queen of England has it with her tea every day! (or so I've been told!)"
3,Not Great But A Decent Biography Book,"The book was OK for the price. Bought the Kindle edition. Typing was a little off in spots. I liked the fact the author actually knew Roosevelt and had first hand knowledge about who he was. In parts of the book I felt like the author was sermonizing about things mildly related to Roosevelt. By the end of the book (section about WWI and Woodrow Wilson) I was bored and skipped a lot. Not a lot of detail about Roosevelt's death. All in all, the book gave me a decemt sense of who Theodore Roosevelt was."
2,A CHORE,"I thought that this author, since he was a peer of TR, might have had some insights into the character of TR that I hadn't read about before. I read ""Mornings On Horseback"" some time ago and wanted to know more about him. This book had nothing to add to my knowledge of this remarkable man so it was a little disappointing but really not surprising since it was written before historians had time to assess this president."
2,Editor and historian needed,"I was able to buy a used copy Of Tom McNamara's book Henry Lunt & the Ranger. In the copy, some retentive underlined each misspelled or misused word, of which there were many. Tom could have used both a good editor, and a good historian. The story he claimed to be based on actual history handed down to him through the Lunt family. It may have been, but it was predictable."
2,Editor and historian needed,"I was able to buy a used copy Of Tom McNamara's book Henry Lunt & the Ranger.

5,These Cats are off the chain!!!,"This cd is what hip-hop is all about. Flows, beats, punchlines, streetz,all that. Every single artist on the C.T.D.C. Records roster has major potential to blow up. I loved every track on this cd. It has 22 bangin' tracks. They give you party knocks , sentimentle stuff, and of course that street stuff. Go pick up this cd, These guys are the next big thing, TRUST ME. If you don't get this cd you are missin out."
1,Does not fit.,"I used Amazon's tool to look for a part to fit my car. It arrived as promised. I removed my tire and the rotor. Upon trying to put the new rotor on... it did not fit! I tried to contact seller and they said they would send me instructions on how to exchange the product, but nothing ever came. I contacted them again and no response.I ended up going to auto zone and getting a similar part (roughly same price) and breaks work fine now.So if anyone needs this part and you know it will fit I have an extra pair."
3,Every other song on this is nice,Every other song on this is just filler music from the movie. It evokes a simmilar mood as the other songs but it is lack luster compared to the other published music on it. I bought it for those songs.
2,Before you buy/ check the shipping charge,"In my own case, the shipping would have cost $2 more than the item itself.Apparently Amazon has gone completely wacko to think anyone would go for that stupid deal. Unless you would like to be the first . . ."
4,Good for beginners,"Yoga Zone Ultimate CollectionThis is a good DVD for Yoga Beginners. There are several DVDs included in this box set. Each targets a different zone which is very useful. I am trying to get back into the YOGA routine, so this is a great DVD for getting me back in the Groove. I would recommend it for Begineers."
3,Bypass the Yoga Zone,"I really wanted to like these people, but after watching each DVD several times, I just put the whole box away. For one thing, the programs are a little dated. Also, the interaction between the yoga instructor and the student seems a little false/silly. And finally, with each installment only about 20 minutes long, there is no time to do much else than a series of poses and adjustments. Not for the serious yogi."
4,Xcelet for beginers & intermediate,"It's a good product for basic levels, si good to use it at home.The class repeat some positions in the diferent dvd's.For $40.0 is OK."
3,Begin Here,"This set has its own virtues. Unfortunately they were not the qualities I was seeking, but I'm sure they are for plenty of others. Each DVD pretty much follows the same format: one 20-minute season followed by a second of the same type and intensity. A complete yoga workout in 25 minutes has its audiences: the format is ideal for anyone with limits on their time/ patience/ fitness. It works pretty well with kids.I feel deceived that this set doesn't disclose itself as beginner-oriented, however. The flexibility DVD posed some new challenges, but in general the practices are not real ambitious. The entire set has the teacher speaking from within the video- not dubbed in- and this can be irritating, as well."
4,Yoga for Complete Beginners,"I bought this set over 2 years ago (can't remember exactly when), after purchasing some beginner's yoga DVDs that I can only describe as a rip-off. This set is what I think a beginner's yoga DVD should be like - not too easy, not too difficult. The instructors are friendly. I was thankful that while the instructors talked about the benefits of yoga, they did not go into ""deep philosophical soliloquys"". The practices are 20-min. long and are themed, which allow the viewer to do short practices (if they don't have the time or are too tired) or to do longer practices, as he/she wishes. When I bought this, I was training for my first marathon - the 20-min. sequences were perfect stretching programs after my runs. Needless to say, I used this set quite often, until I recently gave it to my sister-in-law who wanted to start yoga but couldn't find a decent class close to where she lives.I would definitely recommend this to beginners."
4,love it!,"I first got these DVD's from the local library, kept it forever! Finally, both them for myself and I just love the collection. I am a beginner at yoga but I like that they split the sessions in 2. You can do 20 minutes per DVD or the full 40."
3,polite jazzual affair,"Ok, if I was in charge of producing an unmixed compilation, there are a few simple rules I'd follow. Find the absolute best dozen tracks I can find and sign, give copious liner notes to the artists who actually made the music, and include a sincere forward or acknowledgment to the listener.But what do I know, I just buy music.No, there's nothing wrong with Chill Out in the City 2nd Cut, it's just one of a thousand nondescript mixes destined to fade out of memory. The cuts are polite and jazzual downbeat affairs, typically a sax solo or the sort over drum programming (Blue Smoke, Carroussel, Cocktail). The highlights: Canadian producer Gavin Froome pays a smoky, downtempo visit on ""Closer to Leaving,"" while Mo Horizons drop a spirited Afrobeat standing above everything else here."
2,could be better,"I took a chance with this CD. I am not overly impressed. The first few tracks are interesting, kind of jazzy, but the remainder of the album is monotonous. Nothing new here."
3,Acoustic Christmas,"Deana Carter's stripped down rendition of ""Carol Of The Bells"" was one of the '90s best holiday singles. On Father Christmas, Carter reaches new levels of sparsedom, with the album comprised solely of her warm, clear vocals and some supple guitar work courtesy of her father, esteemed session musician Fred Carter. For the song lineup, Carter selected Christmas staples by some of her musical heroes like Nat King Cole (""The Christmas Song"") and Karen Carpenter (""Merry Christmas Darling""). What works once as a nice change of pace, however, becomes tedious by the tenth and final track, as all of these acoustic renditions start to sound the same. Folk fanatics and Carter devotees will probably enjoy this, but mainstream country listeners are apt to find it a tad boring."
3,Wrong color in pic/descrip,"The box seems fine/sturdy and will suit our purposes. However, very disappointing to think that you are buying a custom/unique color and then to receive standard issue black that we could have bought in any supply store. Amazon please fix the pics/descrip so customers aren't disappointed! We still love Amazon though..."
4,works great,"I bought this for my 7 year old to store his ""treasures"" in Pine cones etc.., the key is easy to use. Great!"
1,NOT BLUE!!!,I ordered this particular box because of the color - I received one in black - called for an exchange and once again received a black one. The item # matches the black box so I'm assuming this picture and item description of blue are incorrect. I would have ordered a different one if it wasn't for the color.
1,Waste of Money,I purchased this money box to use at craft sales. Wanted something small but secure and convenient. The box does not have a latch so you can NOT pick it up by the handle unless it is locked. Not very convenient if you just want to move it from one side of the booth to the other!The change and bill tray have to be tilted *just* right and wiggled into and under the slots in order for the lid to close - not at all convenient when you're trying to stash $ and wait on the next customer!! Or secure when the lid doesn't close!I packed the full box in my suitcase for the trip home and half the change wiggeld out of the box - REALLY not secure OR convenient!!I would've been better off using a shoe box!
4,What I never learned in history class..,"This book give great insight into the political climate during the American revolution. Details of George Washingtons campaigns, were more interesting than I thought possible allthough parts are a bit boggged down by a little to much detail. This book gave me new insight on what Washington was up against. He did so much with so little! His political savvy and great leadership qualities are shown to us. Quite a bit diffrent from the history taught to me in the public school. I like the way Washington is revealed to the reader His story is a powerful reminder of; why we are American."
1,Ridiculous,"I bought some good things at Amazon, but about this swimsuit, you sent me a horrible swimsuit, impossible to use."
4,Not Just for Formalwear,These all silk socks are marketed for formalwear -- but they can be worn with a suit for every day wear as well. This lightweigh silk material is cool and comfortable even in the hottest weather (I live in Texas -- so I know hot weather!) They pop right into the washer and dryer and do not need ironing -- stock up on several pairs of these silky smooth socks!
5,Most refreshing...,Waller makes everyday situations so interesting. His essay on Romance is one of my all-time favourite readings. I have passed it on to many newlywed friends. I have read it so many times the pages in my book are dog-eared.
1,Not 1 star but -1 star,"I got this grinder as a gift last Christmas and obviously the purchaser had done no research. I hate this grinder! The only positive thing I can say is that it matches the looks of my Cuisinart coffee maker, which I love. My old Cuisinart grinder was great. It was smaller but it would grind beans to a uniform size, I like mine almost like dust. This pos grinds them into a variety of sizes except dust, and like other reviewers I have found whole beans left over. But what really infuriates me is that it generates static electricity so that when you dump the grindings into the basket they spread out and you end up with grounds not just in the basket, but around the basket and on the counter top and stuck to the lip of the bowl. This is a messy grinder.I wish I hadn't given my old grinder to charity. I wish this one would just die like everyone else's so I could buy a good one."
1,Poorly Made product,"I purchased this product at a local retail store less than 3 months ago. I didn't do any product research (now I wish I had read the reviews in Amazon),but instead, relied on the brand name. The grinder is now dead - the blade has suddenly loosened to the point that it refuses to grind anything and cannot be removed or tightened (glued is the word used in one of the reviews). I didn't keep the receipt because it was a relative minor purchase and, after all, it was a ""Cuisinart."" So I won't be taking it back(based on some of the experiences expressed in reviews, it doesn't sound like it would worth it anyway). My advise - don't purchase this grinder - its a waste of money."
2,Not as good as previous model,"i am a professional chef and coffee lover...this is touted as cuisinart's premium grinder...NOT!...i had the previous model of this (can't find model number) for years and years...it was a real workhorse providing consistent even grind with no problems until it finally wore out...this model makes a loud motor noise and provides an uneven grind...i had to order twice through amazon to get one delievered...the first one got ""lost"" in shipping...it took almost three weeks to arrive...dealing with amazon ""service"" was very difficult(understanding of basic english on their part would have helped) and it took four tries to get the billing cleaned up...overall a very poor buying experience for a mediocre product...I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
1,Don't associate the Cuisinart name w/quality for this,Worked 3 times and then totally broke. Working = leaving big chunks of beans in the ground coffee.
2,Incomplete grinding,"We got this as a wedding gift but have stopped using it. It grinds poorly with anything more beans for 2 cups of coffee. It's aesthetically pleasing and doesn't break, but I would never buy it again."
3,"Works well, but how long?","The overall concept of the grinder is good. The problems are with the stainless steel/plastic cover. Since purchasing it, the button on top feels cheap and has lost some of it's springback. Also the chrome screws on the underside of the lid have rusted. I hand wash and rinse it after using. Also grinds manage to slip out from under the grind cup and make a cleanup mess on the base. I think Cuisinart can do better than this! It does grind coffee VERY well though."
1,Tired of old grind,"I have had this grinder for 13 months and it stopped working this morning, Dont waste your money on this. My daughter liked the look of this machine. Don't let the looks deceive you. Poor quality."
1,Don't get this hunk of junk,This is so noisy my wife thought she heard a chain saw while still in bed trying to sleep. In addition it messy and doesn't grind evenly.
1,Our second one has just broken!,"My wife and I received one of these as a wedding gift. It worked beautifully for the first couple of times. On the third time however it was sluggish and seemed to take forever to grind the beans. Before it was done grinding it suddenly stopped all together. Luckily we found the receipt and returned it to Macy's for a replacement. The replacement lasted a little longer, but now after just one month (and about 7 uses) the same thing has just happened. Avoid this coffee grinder at all costs! It breaks after a few uses."
1,Broken within 2 months,"Same identical problem as the previous reviewer; the cup leaked coffee grinds and the blade eventually became seperated from the mechanism on the bottom of the cup (the part that attaches to the motor). Although the unit appears sturdy and stable, it's certainly not. The last product I'll every buy from this company."
3,"Nice quiet motor, however...","...if you like fine ground coffee, this is definitely not the grinder for you. I like mine fine most of the time, and although I keep it grinding for quite awhile in this model, at best it turns out like medium ground coffee. Also some of the beans are only partially ground up. If you like semi-course ground coffee, this is for you. But like I said, it's quiet compared to other grinders, and has a detachable cup with a lid that you can store in the fridge."
3,Inconsistent quality control,"We have had experience with three of these grinders. The first one was really good--quiet and efficient when it was full, although didn't grind well when it was partially full. Then we ordered a second one when we moved to a different area. We had to return it to Amazon because the ground coffee leaked out as it was being ground. Amazon then sent us a substitute after we returned the defective one. Although we are keeping this one, it is much noisier than the original one we had, so we are disappointed in it. I think Cuisinart needs much better quality control."
2,Worked great for nearly two years,"My wife always chides me for expecting inexpensive items to last forever. I had high hopes for this bean grinder. But after 20 months the grinding blade axle broke. Humorously it has an 18 month warranty. I think I got my money's worth since I think it was only $30.00 or so.The pluses are that it is made out of a lot of metal parts. The bean / grounds cup is stainless steel and the axle that connects to the motor is brass. As a whirling blade grinder, it didn't do the job that a burr grinder would do as far as grind uniformity but every morning for 19 months it served faithfully. It was also fairly noisy.What broke was the blade where it attached to the axle. The motor spins but the blade doesn't rotate.Cuisinart offers a replacement blade/cup assembly for $14.00, but the unit itself was only $30.00. Not sure if that will be worth it in the long run. I think I'm going to consider a step up to a conical burr grinder."
4,A great unit in my opinion,"My experience with this grinder differs from those who gave it a negative rating. We use this unit every day, and it has done a great job each and every time now for about a year. We have had Krup units and heavy duty grinders recommended by professional coffee retailers and only the Krups grinder matched the Cuisinart for reliability and quality. I get the grind I want each time and have placed this unit on my Amazon.com ""wish list"" so I have a replacement handy should my current unit ever fail. I would obviously recommend it; I believe it's a real value for what it cost. I wish the unit did not rely on plastic so much but if that changed then the price would increase so I will be content with plastic."
2,Blade/Motor shaft sheared after about 6 months,"I was initially very happy with the grind quality of this product with one exception; I would only use it for preparing coffee beans with a fine grind by operating for the recommended 20-40 seconds. If you desire a coarse grind (10 seconds or so), the variation in the grain size is far too wide.My primary issue is that the metal shaft running up to the cup from the motor unit to the cup snapped off after just 5 months of use. Not interested in replacing it, and unfortunately the second bad experience with a Cuisinart product in less than 2 months."
1,"Went through 2 of these in 2 years, same problem","The cup assembly broke on our first unit after about 4 months of light use (once a week maybe). Cusinart replaced the unit. Now a year later, the same problem exists - the blade assembly pushes through and becomes loose. Coffee leaks out the bottom of the cup, and plastic pieces have melted around the blade assembly. Buyer beware. Looking at other reviews its obviously not an isolated case."
1,Do not buy this grinder!!!!!!!!!!,"I have had inexpensive Braun coffee grinders in the past, but decided to splurge on this Cuisinart grinder because I wanted a grinder that could hold more beans. And, hey, Cuisinart has a great reputation and the grinder looked good.I should have returned the grinder months ago, when I first purchased it and found that it took MUCH longer to grind beans than any grinder I'd used in the past. As the months wore on, it seemed to take longer and longer each time; finally, last night, after grinding for several minutes with little success (there were still big coffee bean chunks in there), the grinder started smoking and died.SO DON'T BUY IT!"
1,"Three Uses Later, Into The Garbage","I used this twice, then the removable cup became fused to the base. Nothing would get it off. Okay -- I can deal with that because coffee doesn't really require a lot of cleaning. You can wipe it out with a damp rag. The next time I used it, it stopped grinding altogether.This product has something very wrong with it, and I'm surprised Cuisinart hasn't pulled it from retailers as it must be their lowest rated product, and far below their typically high standards."
1,Fire Hazard! This is a dangerous product!,"I have gone through two of these. The first one I purchased, it had an electrical fire, smoke and sparks, and small flames. I was lucky to be in the room when it did this. It filled the whole kitchen with a horrible stench. I quickly unplugged it from the wall and poured water on it, until the fire was out.After the incident I called Cuisinart's customer service about the fire, they did not really care (it was like speaking to a wall). They said I could send in the damaged unit and have a replacement shipped to me, but I would have to pay the shipping cost. I can't remember now what the cost was, something like $6. I agreed. I sent in the damaged unit and about two weeks latter I got a new one delivered to my house. I have been using the second one for about four months. I am a light user, one grind a day use. On 8/22/07 the second unit caught fire again! I was lucky to be there again.I will never buy another Cuisinart product again!"
1,Do not spend your money on this grinder,"I purchased this grinder the first time in January 2009. In December 2010, just outside the 18 month warranty, the blade broke off in the grinder cup. I contacted Cuisinart for a replacement cup - which would have cost over $20, compared to a new grinder on sale at Kohls for $30. So, I opted for the new grinder, thinking the break was a fluke. Well, this morning, the plastic piece holding the blades broke - resulting in my needing a new cup - again, just outside the warranty. Well, the adage is true - fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I went and bought a cheap Mr. Coffee grinder. And, I've let Cuisinart know that they've lost me as a customer. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker and toaster oven and when they need replacing, I'll search doggedly for replacements make in the USA - if they even exist."
1,Terrible!,"I bought this grinder after having a Braun that lasted over ten years. This is my second Cuisinart grinder in the last sixth months! I should've known not to purchase another Cuisinart but I thought the first one that stopped working was just a fluke. I originally bought it because I liked that it was stainless steel and matched my coffee maker. The second Cuisinart, AFTER THREE MONTHS, started to make a rough sound and would not grind my coffee. The blade's base is made cheaply. Never again! I just bought a Kitchen Aid grinder and hope that it will last longer."
1,Another poor quality Cuisinart product,"After using this grinder for a little over a year, the blade broke off. I had similar luck with a Cuisinart toaster oven, although that unfortunately was a more expensive product. Cuisinart and I are finished.Just ordered a Krups coffee grinder. It's less expensive and is rated 4+ stars."
2,TERRIBLE GARBAGE,"Oh this thing is so bad. I bought the Krups coffee grinder which cost me $20 from Amazon. It didn't have a removable cup which meant coffee grounds all over the place. I returned it and bought this. Worst decision I've made since dropping out of high school. This thing was horrifying. It broke barely a week after I begun using it. The removeable cup would get stuck on its base and the motor burned out during a grind. Even when it worked it barely ground the whole beans into powder. It just kind of ground the whole beans into smaller whole beans. I have since re-purchased the Krups which I initially had bought, and besides the occasional clean up, I am thoughly happy with the decision. Don't buy this rubbish. Oh yeah, I gave it two stars and not one because it is a good looking grinder. So if you want a grinder to show your neighbors be prepared to change the subject when they want coffee."
1,Motor died after very few uses. Junk,"Same situation as the one told by the other users.Received as a gift a year ago. We did not use it almost at all until last fall we bought a espresso machine.After maybe less than 20 uses the unit died. As I'm a pretty good handyman I figured a switch failed. Surprise, looks like the electric motor is burned.What a piece of junk. Why do companies like Cuisinart even put such products on the market. It's not rocket scince to test a product for 50 - 100 use cycles. I will never buy a Cuisinart again"
1,Stuck Top,"I bought this grinder and used it for less than a month when the top froze so I couldn't remove it. I had misplaced the sales slip;so, I bought another because I liked the feature of removing the top. My intention was to use the new sales slip to return the first item. Trouble is, the second grinder has done the same thing. I called customer service as indicated on the waranty and was told to place the grinder in the refrigerator to reduce the size of a plastic part that probably had expanded. I suggested I didn't have room to store my grinder in the refrigerator. I can't believe plastic would expand and contract like that and that doing the cooling wouldn't be necessary after every use. Grumble!"
2,"Poor performer, poor quality","I was disappointed in the performance as soon as I bought it, but decided to put up with it until it died. The grind was uneven, with some beans barely cut in half, despite the length of grinding time. I was relieved when the blade mechanism broke this week, 26 months after purchase."
1,It didn't last.,"I had high hopes for this, but after a 3 months, it suddenly stopped working. Definitely NOT worth the money!"
2,Died quickly - only few months of use,"This is the second time I purchased the grind central coffee grinder. The first one lasted a bit longer, but the coffee bean container that holds the beans gets stuck and needs to be manhandled to be removed from the base. Even with that flaw, I still decided to try again. The container was still stuck regularly (hard to remove for cleaning) and then it died only after a few months use. Not worth the $30 to purchase."
2,Nice while it lasted,"In its first year it was great. Quiet, fast, nice removable container. Then the container jammed in place and couldn't be removed. Later the motor burned out in the middle of a grind. I have had coffee grinders that lasted 20 years. This one didn't make it through year two."
1,"Engine burned out after 14 months, only used a few times a month","I bought this because of the Cuisinart name, and it worked wonderfully while it worked. I used it at most twice a month, as I don't always buy whole bean coffee. Just when I bought specialty roasts for special occasions. After only 14 months (and used maybe 25 times) the engine burned out. I contacted customer service and since it was outside the warranty they wouldn't repair or replace it. I hated to throw a ""newer"" appliance in the trash so I asked if it could be recycled, they said 'no'. So it's now taking up space in a dump somewhere (I even tried posting it as free on CL and had no replies)."
1,Breaks too easily..,"I have now bought two of these grinders, both of which crapped out after about a month of grinding. I filled the first one too much, I guess, and it burned out. The second fared the same with less coffee than the first one. The cup that comes with it is cool because it has a lid and stores easily, but it is small as some other reviews say. After two, I am done. Buy another grinder, the Cuisanart name here doesn't mean much.93 negative reviews should tell you something."
3,can't produce a fine grind!,"anyone giving this one 5 stars either is not a coffee connoisseur or must have used a VERY old grinder in the past.This unit cannot make a find grind, regardless how long you spin it, period. My coffee ended up having way less aroma in the cup.Also, this unit takes twice as long than my Krups to produce that coarse grind. The Krups takes 10 seconds to produce the finest espresso powder. The bulkiness is another issue. This one demands counterspace, and is a finger print magnet, like all stainless steel items.(They do not wipe off easily) I bought it for the removable cup, but turns out it is cumbersome to use and engage, and takes the same 'tapping effort' to pour out the grind. This unit is overkill on size and looks, yet underperforms big time on the only task it was designed for. How bad is that?"
1,Really poor,"I bought this grinder because I thought Cuisinart makes good products. What a mistake... This thing is quite loud, it is a mess to clean, it rosts, and above all...it grinds terribly! The coffee comes in all sizes, usually half beans on the top and powder on the bottom even though I shake it in between while it grinds (which you really shouldn't have to do...). We love our morning coffee, and we use French Press; this grinder produces very disappointing and inconsistent results. I am looking into byuing a new one, and I will not buy another blade grinder. Spending $60-80 on a burr grinder seems more than worth it after this experience."
1,"Yuck, terrible experience!","When my old Braun (12 years+) developed a rip in the wire. I thought it time to replace it for safety reasons. I purchased the Cuisinart as I thought the design was smart and the brand was reliable in my experience (I have one of their coffeemakers and their food processor). Well let me tell you how wrong I was about this grinder. The first one developed a two inch crack in the plastic cover after ONE use. I realize that sometimes products can be lemons and do not like to submit bad reviews on DOA products so was willing to try another. Well on the second one, the stainless bowl (it holds the beans and grinder blade) got stuck on the grinder and would not come off. The ability to remove this bowl and put it in the dishwasher is the big selling point to this, but if that is broken? Back to the store for this lousy product. It did not grind well either, big chunks among powder. Stay away! I'm trying the Kitchenaid. Will review that when ready."
1,really disappointed!,"I'm a cuisinart fan, and that's why I got this grinder a week ago DESPITE the negative reviews here I read about its burned smell from the motor while grinding coffee. You know what? That's true. Not even one second from starting the machine, the burned smell comes out of it other than the aroma of the coffee - how amazing! I kept using it for a week until I couldn't stand it any more. Returned it today. Believe or not, this machine has problems, and I don't care that nothing is actually wrong. The smell is annoying enough for the company to recall all its products. I am really disappointed and will think twice before getting any cuisinarts."
2,To Grind or To Not Grind,"The Grind Central(tm) Coffee Grinder by Cuisinart seems to make an attempt to grind coffee beans. With some stirring of the beans it is possible to get most of them ground up for use in a coffee maker. Recently this device, which has a removable cup, has become a problem. The removable cup is stuck and looking on-line for a solution produces few if any real choices. No information is available from Cuisinart about this problem although there a numerous notes on the internet indicating I am not alone. There should be a simple solution however it does not appear that easy. If you are looking for a coffee grinder and need one in a pinch, this one may do it for you but beware of unground beans and the real possibility of having the removable cup not longer be removable."
1,Absolute worst grinder in history,"Almost unusable. After grinding you end up with boulders and at the bottom the coffee is so fine that it goes through the filter! I've tried mixing the grinds with a spoon or my finger half way through grinding to get the coffee dust (fine grounds) mixed with the boulders but to no avail.On top of that, it's very messy. Grinds end up all over the place.Oh, and it's expensive.A coffee grinder's sole purpose is to grind coffee. This one makes a better paper weight."
1,Stuck Bowl,"After a few uses the bowl could not be released from the assembly. It absolutely could not release. It is the same problem reported by M. Bearden on June 17, 2007. This product is a real piece of junk and I threw mine in the garbage where it belongs. It's probably not worth the effort to get a new one. Don't waste your money. I am trying a different brand."
1,Doesn't even work!,"I just tried this for the first time, and it doesn't work at all. At first the blades spun around but did not break up any beans, and then very quickly it smelled like it was overheating and now it doesn't work at all. The grinder lasted less than one minute, and ground nothing. I'm surprised since it's Cuisinart. I should've looked at the reviews on amazon first."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was a Christmas gift from my daughter who knew that I wanted a grinder that I could use for both coffee and spices and clean between uses. I used it once to grind coffee before it quit working. For the few brief moments that it worked, it ground the coffee unevenly. I am back to looking for a spice grinder that can be washed between uses and trying to figure out how to tell my daughter that her thoughtful gift was a complete flop!"
2,So so,"Large size was the initial appeal, and low price comparable to other larger models. But only OK...and only if: you ignore the directions re capacity. Hopper more than half full will produce very uneven grind, and filling it more than half full (to max. indicated by mfg.'s marking) will require a long, slow process. Pulsing, rather than continuous grind helps, but a tedious process. Overheats easily. Lasted maybe a year, using it every couple of days (one half-full hopper lasts me a couple of days. Probably would last even less if I used it daily, let alone several times a day. Removable, washable hopper with separate snap-on lid is handy. Will replace with another model. No sense wasting money on repair, though I hate to discard anything when repairs are practical."
1,Worked poorly then crapped out in THREE MONTHS!,Just another piece of junk from China. Some of the grounds would be fine powder which would pack below the blades while some of the beans would be hardly touched by the blades at all. You know if we quit buying this poorly made Chinese merchandise companies will quit producing it. Just say'in.
3,works well but can't get the bowl off the grinder without help,"I purchased the Cuisinart Grind Central Coffee Grinder, and I'm very disappointed because I can't remove the bowl that holds the ground coffee without assistance from my husband. I admit I'm not that strong and have a slight problem with arthritis, but it really is difficult to remove so I can put the coffee in the coffee pot. If my husband isn't here, I'm unable to use the grinder. It's really irritating and makes me avoid using it."
1,caught fire on first use,I purchased this unit some time ago and set it on the shelf for some future use....today I used the unit for the very first time and within minutes black smoke started belching from the bottom. I shut it down and called Cuisinart and they simply said it's out of warrenty so we can't help you. I tried to tell them this was a serious fire hazzard but again was told out of warrenty we can't help you. I guess some manufacturers don't care that you won't ever buy their products again....Ed Freeman
2,how convenient that the warranty falls just short of the life of the product,"slick looks, but poor design, and clearly faulty production. very loud. does not grind well at full capacity, so it's misleading to say it can grind as much as is claimed. does not grind beans very finely. most importantly, one morning, the motor just stopped in mid-grind. fabulous to found it that the 18-month warranty had just expired and cuisinart would take no action. i ADORE my cuisinart food processor, which has worked perfectly for over 12 years. this just isn't consistent - what do they do, outsource the manufacturing of their minor appliances?!"
1,terrible,Got this grinder about 1 1/2 years ago. It never grinded well... leaving whole beans unless you went well over a minute. And now it is falling apart. I found small pieces of plastic in the bowl and it makes a horrible noise. I'm having to replace it already. A real piece of junk compared to most Cuisinart products.
1,Worked for 5 seconds,"I do not usually write reviews for products, but I often read them when considering a purchase. Recently I received this product from my wedding registry. We decided to register for small kitchen appliances from Cuisinart because of their reputation. Unfortunately, when registering, we didn't read the reviews because I would not have asked for this grinder. I filled the reservoir half way and pressed the button. The grinder ran for five seconds and burned out. Thankfully the stores return policy was fantastic. We chose the Magic Bullet instead. It does a great job and is very versatile."
1,if you are looking for durability don't buy,"This grinder performs efficiently, it grinds a cup of beans fairly quickly, though you have to manually monitor the grind to get the size you want. It has nice user controls and is easy to operate and clean. I was very happy with it while is was working.Unfortunately, it appears that the motor is severely under-specified for the application and the unit stops working fairly quickly. Mine lasted for about 2 months and about 4 pounds of coffee. So even though Cuisinart did a really great job of design I'll most likely never buy another Cuisinart branded product.I guess this goes straight to the landfill, though the box is recyclable."
1,Did not last,"I bought this a few months ago, decent enough, not too loud, then last week the blade came off (as mentioned in other reviews)and you can't put it back, its broken!So its an expensive gadget just for a few months. Not worth it at all!Now I am shopping for a different brand."
2,Uneven Grinds,"I really wanted this grinder to work well because it looks so flippin' cool. Unfortunately, it falls way short in the functionality column. The one plus (that it looks like others haven't had) is that its lasted through 3 years of heavy use. The main issue, though, is that it doesn't produce consistent grinds (grounds?) -- the ones at the bottom are powder fine (I have to scrape them out with a spoon) while the ones up top are bigger than I want my coffee grinds to be. Argh. I end up whacking the detachable (nice feature) base over the coffee maker ever morning trying to get the powder out of the bottom. For $30, I'd stay away..."
2,Tippy cover. Broke down after a year of light use.,"During our one-year ownership of this grinder, the cover fell off multiple times until it shattered (bad design; don't store the grinder on a high shelf). No problem, we found a replacement cheap at the Cuisinart web site.One month later, the motor died.Find another grinder and don't waste your money."
1,Good for about 20 uses,"This little grinder worked well for coffee and spices for approximately 20 uses, but then the motor started slowing down and would only grind coffee beans until they were half their original size. The entire time I owned it, before having issues with the motor, it was always very difficult to take the canister out of the base. Don't waste your money on this product. It won't last."
1,Do NOT Buy,"We purchased a Cuisinart coffee maker with a grinder despite that fact that there were warnings in reviews....""have to really clean everyday"" and ""it has a tendency to run over if you don't""....as in onto the countertop instead of into the coffee pot. So, in the morning you are greeted with a nasty job rather than a nice ""wake-up sleepy head"" cup of coffee. Coffee on the counter, coffee on the floor, coffee running down the cabinets....everywhere EXCEPT in the pot!SO after 5 or 6 times of having to clean up in the morning (even though we cleaned the coffeemaker every day) we gave it away (even though it cost > $100) and bought another Cuisinart coffee maker without a grinder. SO, we then bought this grinder to go with it. That was about three months ago and it no longer works...at all. Do not buy this....do not waste your money....believe what you read."
3,Review Cuisinart Coffee Grinder,I have had several different brands of coffee grinders and I would rate the Cuisinart as the best of all of them
3,cleaning and drying.,The top is badly designed because there is no way to dry it after it has been washed. You have to let it air dry.
1,Bowl won't release,"What a disappointment!! On the very first grinding session, the bowl will not release from the base. We are turning it correctly- counterclockwise- and cannot get it to release. I had tried the release before grinding the first, and only batch, of coffee, and it easily released. Then we ground one measure of beans, and it won't release. I wish I had checked out this website before buying this product."
1,Cuisinart DCG-12BC - shockingly poor performance,"I am blown away by the crappiness of this product. Mom should have done her homework before buying me this lemon for Christmas. I've been reading the other reviews, and it makes me relatively angry at Cuisinart for putting out what they SURELY must have known was a bad product. Motor burned out within 2 pounds of beans being run through it, and I never got a decent grind in the first place. Produced coffee ""gravel"" of all grades and sizes, making for a mediocre cup of joe, at best. dropped the lid from a height of about 2 1/2 feet and shattered the little black operational button. This, just before the motor fried trying to grind roughly half a cup of beans. Guess I'll chalk it up as a loss and go back to bed - so sleepy..."
4,LOVE IT,"I LOVE IT TO DEATH. IT LOOKS GREAT, DOES A GREAT JOB AND THE REMOVABLE CUP MAKES IT EASY TO MOVE THE FINISHED PRODUCT TO YOUR STORAGE CONTAINER."
1,Bad Grinder,"Normally I would fully endorse Cuisinart's products... This one just fell a little short though. After owning it for two months, the motor burned out.... Literally. This morning when I was grinding my coffee smoke started coming out of the bottom vents, so I let it cool for about 15 mins... When I restarted it, the grinder worked for about 20 seconds and started smoking worse, then abruptly stopped working."
1,Poor quality,"Thought we'd spluge and buy a relatively high priced grinder. No issues with the quality of grind, but blade assembly broke in less than a year. 2nd time we've been highly disappointed with a Cuisinart product. I suppose fool us once, shame on them; fool us twice shame on us. There won't be a third time."
1,Poor design,"Returned the first as the cup ""fused"" itself to the base unit and no gentle or tough prying would coax it off. Of course, the return was at my expense with a handling charge by Cuisinart. Now the second unit has done the same thing. I will not return as the two returns and handling fees will have cost me more than one unit. I don't have a problem with coffee residue - I think you get this with any grider but the removable cup is why I spent the extra money in the first place. Like another reviewer, I will keep using until it dies and wipe the cup out as it is not rocket science. Will never buy a Cusinart product again unless it has ONLY RAVE reviews."
1,Buy Something Else,"If your Cuisinart grinder breaks within 18 months of your purchase, you can probably get some new parts. But if, as in my case, your Cuisinart breaks after 18 months, you're out of luck. The cheap plastic that held my blade in shattered the other day, and customer service said that it would cost approximately $20 for them to send me a new one. In case you haven't noticed, that's only $9 less than if I bought an entirely new machine on Amazon (which currently sells for $29).Overall, avoid this grinder. Go with a ""burr mill""--it'll be more expensive, but you'll appreciate the decision in the long run."
1,Used it 5 times and it started smoking,"I received this coffee grinder as a wedding present a few years ago. The grinder sat in storage for ~18 months while we were moving and setting up in a new home. Two months ago I unpacked the brand new unit and started grinding coffee beans. After using the grinder 4 times, it started to smell like burning and after the 5th use the unit started smoking. I call Cuisinart with my compliant, but since I had the unit for 18 months and never used it, it has passed its 18-month warranty. Don't buy this coffee grinder unless you wanting your coffee beans to be re-roasted while grinding."
2,Nice looking while it lasted...,The grinder lasted about 8 months. It did its job if the grinder was filled to capacity but if you just wanted to grind a small amount it was inconsistent as to the grindy-ness you ended up with. When the motor finally cut out their customer service wanted me to find the credit card statement from when I bought it for a replacement. I guess I'm just used to tech companies just sending you a replacement no-questions-asked that this seemed like such a ridiculous request. Do NOT buy this product. Poor quality and poor customer service. Don't be lured by its attractive looks.
2,Messy,"This grinder is really messy. Coffee grounds collect in the plastic dome lid when grinding and then, due to static, don't shake/tap out. The biggest design flaw is the interior contour of the plastic lid, which has a raised ring intended to fit the circumference of the steel grinding cup, but it just creates a hard to reach ring of coffee grounds that, after a few uses, are coating the entire plastic lid interior and the base, the steel cup, the counter, etc., requiring a lot of cleaning time.I do like that the base holds any length of the cord. And I haven't had a problem with the grind, I like the one-button style so you can just keep grinding to preferred level of fine/course. But the messiness is a deal breaker. I'm switching to something with a glass container."
4,Work at Home and now buying for gifts,"You won't regret it, buy two for spices as well, it grinds from course to fine. Love it, you will to"
2,Dust and chunks,"I found one in a thrift store, new in the box. I ran it and pulsed it just for good measure, and got a product that was truly inconsistent in texture. Well I can't return it, but at least my money helps the Goodwill Industries."
1,this is NOT the grinder you are looking for,"The grinder is terrible for these reasons:1) Messy -- there is no seal between the rim of the cup and the transparent lid.2) Noisy -- there does not appear to be any effort to contain the noise associated with vibration. When you disassemble the unit you'll discover that the motor is mounted on plastic columns that are part of the black plastic mold that holds the metal skin in place -- meaning, all the vibrations of the motor are transmitted throughout the black shell, and then to the metal skin. Even while holding the unit with both hands, it was still louder than the unit we bought to replace it."
2,Blade assembly cracked,"Bought this locally and have had it for about a year. It's hard to keep clean, but that seems to be an issue with most grinders.The plastic hub that attaches the blade to the cup assembly broke and Cuisinart wants $20 (including shipping) to replace it.Totally not worth it and I'm going to look for a different brand next time."
2,do not buy this,"Bought 2 of these. First one worked once, then could not get the cup off the grinder. Called customer service and they said they had never hear of this problem. Returned it to the store, tried another one, same thing happened. When I returned it this time, the sales clerk guessed what was wrong before I even told her because they had so many of these returned. They encouraged me not to buy a Cuisinart product. Have a black and decker burr grind now and so far so good."
