5,VS rock,"Episode's 90-99 shows that Bleach's plot is really deep compared to Naruto.Bounto group has entered Soul Society thanks to Ishida regaining temporarily his Quincy powers.Im not gonna be a spoiler here, but there's a lot of pretty interesting fights here ;(by order of fights in this episodes)Ichigo vs Kariya, Rukia vs Bounto Girl, Byakuya vs Kariya vs Ichigo(very nice!), Shinigami Rebel(forgot his name) vs Zaraki Kenpachi( my fave character in the series). So watch and dont miss this fights! =]"
4,...,"Don't be mislead by the cover of some of these DVDs, this is not a Samurai story. But shaking that expectation off it's pretty darn good."
1,Scammed,"I never received the product, nor did I get an answer regarding why. You bill my credit card and then don't deliver. I'll never fall for that scam again."
5,Bleach is King Among New Anime,"Other than Naruto and Fullmetal Alchemist, hardly any other series can contend for the best recently released anime straight from Japan. Though personally, I think Bleach is the FREAKIN' BEST!!! Naruto has been an incredible force in the anime crowd in America, but I think Bleach is better, when you compare all the arcs. (Naruto Fillers < Bleach Bountou Arc)I am so buying this whole series, assuming the dubbing was well done. I haven't seen the Adult Swim version yet, so I don't actually know. I expect that they won't cut out the bloody scenes and the shorts >XD"
2,Not as good as her others,"I see that all the other reviewers just loved this book. I found it disappointing. I didn't really like any of the characters. Jacqueline is less appealing here than in the previous books in the series. None of the other characters are very well-drawn either. The part about the romance convention are very funny, but all the references to romance books are dated. Romances don't follow this old-fashioned plot any more. The identity of the killer wasn't much of a surprise either, and frankly, neither were any of the so-called ""plot twists.""I really like her other series better, the ones featuring Amelia Peabody or even better, the Vicky Bliss books."
5,Grace Received,"This book is fabulous! A must for the person who thinks they have done too much wrong for God's forgiveness and love. Stephen Arterburn lets you know that no sin is beyond God's grace and forgiveness by giving intimate examples of his own sins. This book will open the eyes of the ""unworthy"" seeker. There is no one unworthy of God's love."
5,As Expected...,"Steven Arterburn has never disappointed me in any of his writings. This is no exception. For those who may think they've run out of opportunities, this book will help them see the Truth. God is in the business of giving second chances. Be uplifted and encouraged through this book."
1,Poorly designed,"I bought this lamp from amazon.com and I'm really disappointed in it. My problems with it:a. Lacking any kind of dimmer, it's reading lamp (the side one) is much too bright for it's intended purpose.b. The swivel on the side lamp is useless - because of the lack of tension on the screw holding it in, it simply flops around. It looks useful and isn't - this is my biggest problem with this lamp.This was my first purcahse of a lamp or furniture of any kind via Amazon, so perhaps I was just naive in believing some of the reviews."
3,Torchiere lamp,"The lamp is pretty cool looks wise. It has both a reading lamp and a full sized lamp which is always nice. For the price I think that it was pretty reasonable. I would suggest this lamp to anyone who is looking for something cheap, yet attractive in style and design."
2,pole broke early on,"Bought this at Target. Was OK at first. It screwed together easily. The thin shade on top and side were very bright, not really an uplight. But it soon fell apart in the middle of the pole. It seems where the pole screwed together, the threads weren't deep enough or didn't stick out far enough to keep them together. It wouldn't stay together right in the middle of the pole and was cocked at an angle. I had every intention of returning it but I knocked it with the chair and it the top half of the lamp came crashing down. I'm not going to buy another because I didn't like the light it gave off. And now I've read about fires in other reviews. yikes!"
3,Practical,"Floor lamp is cheaply made, but I was not expecting much since the price was so low. It's serving its purpose, so I'm happy w/it. I like function, simplicity and economy, and that's exactly what it is."
4,Great idea!,"I have the ""Walmart"" version of this lamp, so basically the shades are made from plastic and it's neon pink instead of silver. I think this lamp is a genius idea! Its modern looking and matches my room quite well. I can now read books in bed with the reading lamp positioned wherever i want it and dont have to get up to turn it off!"
5,Haunting and Beautiful Story,"This was one of my favorite books as a kid. It leaves the reader with a mysterious, sort of sad feeling. The illustrations are beautiful. It's been years since I read this book, but I remember it well. I couldn't remember the name so I searched for ""girl, cricket, pirate"" and found it. I'm glad I did, I want to order it and read it again."
3,used books,"I purchased a copy of Maggie and the Pirate to donate to our school library in honor of a retired Kindergarten teacher. The used book arrived on time but in more ""well loved"" condition than I was lead to believe. Very expensive for a very used book."
2,Disappointed,Book said it was in new great condition but the book that came was an old library book with tattered edges and dulled pages. Wouldn't consider it new or in great condistion. Good thing it was only 3$.
2,Another Dysfunctional Family,"While there is nothing terribly wrong with this movie there is, unfortunately, nothing terribly right either. We've all been there before - dysfunctional family gathers at the bedside of a dying (choose 1: grandparent, parent, sibling, child). The actos do well with their roles, but can barely rise above the stereotypes. The poignancy in the film comes from the situation itself, not from any skill in the writing. Each scene follows a predictable inevitability (even the scattering of the ashes at the end), and the humor is forced and unnatural, with two completely superfluous scenes (a son trying to retrieve his bag at the airport; another son trying to get the store discount for orange juice at a grocery) added as intended humorous interludes to break up the sadness of the main story line. There have been many much better films about dying (Wit and One True Thing come to mind immediately), so don't bother with this one unless you're a die-hard Sally Fields fan.."
3,Cancer Reality,Sally Fields was really good in this film. It was very true to my experience with cancer deaths and families. Still might be hard to watch for some whose experience is recent.
2,2.5 stars for uneven production,"I wanted to provide the names of the songs on the soundtrack because they might be of interest to other viewers. There is no soundtrack for purchase at this time as far as I can see. The songs included are:Guster - Fa Fa, You're Lovely to Me - Lucky Jim, Somewhere Only We Know - Keane, See The World - Gomez, Each Coming Night - Iron & Wine.I didn't really like the movie very much, but it may have been the genre that grated on me rather than the actual performances of the actors. The 20/30 something children in this movie other than the daughter Emily seemed relatively self-centered. It was sad to think that their mother was leaving at a point when they really could have benefitted from some life lessons. And the poor step-dad got left out in the cold! As if he wasn't grieving as well!"
2,Horrible attempt at humor for serious subject matter,"This movie is so BAD, that I felt compelled to write a negative review for it.While dying of ovarian cancer, Sally Field's 4 children return home, to joke with each other, and exhibit total disrespect for her condition.I know, sometimes humor might lighten the mood in certain situations, but this was purely OVER THE TOP, and in poor taste, ending with the family spilling her ashes on themselves in an accident, at a grave site.I'm giving this 2 stars, because I think some of the acting is very good, but they CONSTANTLY ripped the rug out from underneath the viewer with this sick / tongue in cheek humor.I'm so glad this was a 99 cent rental."
4,Sally Field in Humour Death,I thought this was endearingly humourous of Sally's role!!What a way to get your kids home for a visit!! High Five's!!
2,Too Weak!,"Wow, so much for my faith in Sally Fields. I guess she is back to her Cannonball Run ability to pick stories. What a dud this is. I think it was written by a junior high student in detention over the course of one week. The script is totally ridiculous, petty, lazy, and insulting. The characters have no character, the story has no point, and there's nothing poignant about this movie, supposedly about a serious and profound subject. Avoid like death!"
5,Bittersweet Reality,"This is a wonderful film with great acting. It truly captures the essence of grief. Each person handles their grief differently. There is no correct way to deal with it or in some cases, not deal with it.This movie is a must for someone who has lost or who is near to losing a loved one. Sally Fields does a remarkable job of revealing the mixed emotions for a person dealing with death in a healthy manner. Her children, all of which handle the situation according to their personal quirks, issues and reality, also portray the varied methods of handling one's grief.I highly recommend."
4,Plain Jane,"What can one say; it's a box of white paper towels. If you like your paper towels in box, in lieu of on a roll, this is the towel for you.The most amusing part is the ""product performance"" bar chart printed on the bottom of the box. The chart does not have a scale. The L10 is the lowest on the chart, and coincidently is also the cheapest. Ergo, one can infer that the missing scale should be cost. I know Kimberly-Clark is just using the box bottom for advertising and attempting to encourage consumers to try the more expensive wipes, but this ""performance"" bar chart looks like it was made by a fifth grade student, and it contains no performance data whatsoever.- J19, Rocket Scientist"
4,Definetly Worth the Money,"This bracelet is about 8 inches (20 cm) around and stretchy. There are two stretchy, durable threads holding the beads together. The alternating circular and rock turquoise beads are very cute and accentuated by the silver colored beads, however, the silver is already rubbing off on the edges of the beads. This is only noticeable on close inspection, so others won't notice, but it could mean that the silver will eventually completely wear off. However, for less than $3, it's worth it."
3,A little too short.,"I love Tow Mater. I'll admit it, I'm 29 years old. I love Cars, and I love Tow Mater. I bought this collection of shorts b/c if you love Mater, you should own it. I was disappointed to find out that it's only 34 minutes of cartoons. The animation is spectacular, the stories are very creative, and everything is PIXAR level. However, it's a tad short. I don't care about all the other fluff, I just want cartoons. This is still a great product, just billed a little incorrectly."
4,Great Stories but Way Too Short,My son loves CARS and I someone recommended Tall Tales. I absolutely love the stories which always have some subtle underlying message but the DVD was way too short. I wish they could have packed more like maybe some lost episodes and never before seen content.
4,2yr old loves it!,"My son is OBSESSED with the movie Cars. After watching it practically everyday (sometimes twice) for the past few months, I (not my son) started getting sick of it. I was so glad to see that there was an alternative for him to watch and he loves Mater's Tall Tales as well! It's nice that it's several short stories (versus a long movie) so that he can finish a tall tale in a short car ride. I just wish there were more stories for him! Also, one of the tall tales has a song by Mater that repeats ""Dadgum!"" over and over. Not sure if I want my son learning to say ""Dadgum"" repeatedly in song."
2,For (Little) Kids ONLY,"Ummm.... Wow. I am a huge Pixar fan, and loved the Cars movie. I was super excited to see that they were releasing this DVD, and purchased it as soon as I realized it was available. Unfortunately, after watching it with my three kids (11, 9, 7), I have to report that we were all disappointed in the shorts. There is maybe one chuckle per short episode. This was just not up to the quality of any of the other Pixar works."
2,"Only 34 minutes of playing time, too fast-paced for young kids","I bought this title for 20 cents when I joined the Disney Movie Club. When I first played it, I couldn't believe the total playing time, chopping off the front stuff and the credits, is just a little over 34 minutes -- not counting the episode titles themselves. If you pay the Amazon price, that's 50 cents per minute. To add insult to injury, most of the stories are pretty dumb, and the whole animation is too flashy and fast-paced for kids under the age 9 or 10. Larry the Cable Guy does a fine job voicing Mater, but the stories themselvers are just disappointingly silly (not the kind of fun silly Cars 2 is). Totally overpriced."
2,"Cute, but SHORT","We were very disappointed in the running time of this! The movie was cute, there are probably 8 little skits, varying from 3-5 minutes each. I paid 19.99 for this, I would never have bought it for that price if I had known how short it is!"
3,Mater's Tall Tale's Review,"I was excited about getting this Blu Ray for my child since we watch the original movie constantly. Overall Mater's Tall Tales is a decent movie and my child enjoys it very much. The length of the movie is a lot shorter than what I thought it would be, so don't expect a full lengh movie."
2,dvd review,Not worth the price. I expected something somewhat similar to the CARS movie. Instead it was minute clips and an hour on the people who made the CARS movie.
1,So bad even my three year old won't watch it again......,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would at least be somewhat as good as the movie, but this was a huge disappointed. Five minutes into it and we all were bored and stopped watching it. Even my three year old told me that it was a bad DVD and that I need to get another better one for him to watch. I'm not sure if Pixar made this DVD, but by far the worst programming that I and my son have watched. Save your money, don't buy this."
1,Wrong DVD sent,I am sure I would have liked the dvd had the correct one been sent to me. I hope to have the whole problem corrected soon.
3,Disappointed in Total movie time.....,"I bought this movie for my 4 yr old son's birthday. I specifically checked the run time of 90? minutes. Sunday he was watching it for the first time and before I got dinner ready it was over. I was like ""Why did you turn it off?"" Everyone said it's over. Do you really think my kids gonna be entertained by 1 hour of ""out takes?"" Um..No. Mater is funny don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't have bought it had I known the actual movie time is 38 minutes. :( HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!"
1,This was painful,"Disclaimer: I am a 27 year-old adult who was convinced to watch this when babysitting by a very persistent 2 year-old whose argument included such key points as ""Cars!"", ""Cars?"", and ""CARS?!?!?!""This ""movie"" was about 35 minutes long. Here is the plot (WARNING: SPOILERS...in addition to the one on the racecar).Larry the Cable Truck: ""This one time, I was a monster truck!""(flashback)Lightning McWhatever: ""I don't believe you.""Larry the Cable Truck: ""You should remember! You was there, too!""(character from flashback appears in modern day to confirm story)Repeat the above portion 6 times, replacing ""monster truck"" with ""daredevil, abducted by aliens, bullfighter, Japanese street racer, firetruck, and astronaut.""If you are not a 2 year-old, you will probably not enjoy this. If you are a 2 year-old, the fact that you can read this review probably renders you too intelligent for this video, and you best get back to Genius Toddler School."
5,Mater Toons,"Its Funny how they are coming out with collection, as my wife and I were talking about this a few months ago. We told each other how nice it would be if they would come out with a DVD with all the Mater Toons on it. My son loves these shorts, and since we had to reduce over TV package, he isn't able to see them anymore. Now, he will be able to watch them whenever he wants. They are so funny, and I can't wait to see his reaction when he sees this. He asks us about these toons everytime he watches Cars, so now I can tell him he can watch them again. Great idea by Disney to release this."
2,So Little for So Much,"Why two stars? Too freakin' expensive for 38 minutes of content. Sure there is over forty minutes of extras (one of the longest being an infomercial for Disneyland), but the real ""meat"" are Mater's Tall Tales.I give the Tall Tales themselves FIVE STARS. But for Pixar/Disney to price so little content at $29.99 is ridiculous. Even at $19.99 it is too much.Just look at all you get on the Cars blu-ray, that is pretty good value.There must have been more stuff in the Pixar vaults that they could have paired this with.That said, Tokyo Mater, is pure genius."
5,My 7yrold loves this as much as we do!,My kid loves extras though - I don't think most kids want to see how these things are made; but she often wants to watch the extras first!We got this from Netlix but it's all on one disc. ????? All the cartoons plus all the pixar documentary stuff> Weird.Anyway we have to own this!
4,Great set of short movies,"My 4 year old loved the shorts. If you aren't familiar with this ""movie"" its actually a number of very short movies about 5-10 minutes each. You can pick individual ones or let the whole thing play through. When it started I thought they were a little short, but there are so many that the length of each is appropriate."
2,Would be 4 stars with a longer run time,"Its mater in a collection of shorts, the problem is the shorts are too short for only 38 minutes run time. If the dvd went to around 60 minutes I would give it 4 stars, but at the 38 minutes, I give it 2 stars for not a great value."
4,Funny little shorts,"These are very funny if your little guy is into cars. They are cute as can be. Not the best thing ever, but cute."
5,Cars Toon: Mater's Tall Tales,I gave this movie to my grandson and he really liked it. A good family movie and and one that will entertain him for a long time.
2,Crappy video quality,"The video quality of this DVD is very poor. Pixelated and bad looking. I thought something was wrong with my DVD, but every player I try it on is the same."
1,Received this DVD in a foreign language!,I gave this product a single star because it is not in English as I ordered it. I ordered this DVD for my nephew's birthday and now I have to go through several hoops to get it returned and in the meantime I don't have the gift my nephew asked for in time for his birthday. I am very disappointed considering I am a mother of three children under three who doesn't have any extra time to resolve these types of problems. That is why I often shop online but apparently it is not always as convenient.
4,Fun but too short,"If you are a Cars fan, you might want to have this in your collection. It's kind of fun but the story is nothing close to the first Cars movie. This one is about 30 minutes. I will not consider that as a real story on Mater's life."
1,Baloney,"I challenge anyone who reads this book to do what I did: comb through all of Linneman's data bit by bit, use it to color code your Bible, and see for yourself if there is or is not a synoptic problem. There surely is. Linneman's data is valuable; the conclusions she draws from it are ridiculous."
5,Excellent toothbrush - noticable results.,"I previously owned a rotary electric toothbrush. The Excel is a superb brush, which cleans the teeth in an amazing up and down vibration pattern. I would never go back to manual brushing or an electric rotary brush. Try it -- your teeth will be glad you did!"
3,Carpe Diem Journal,"I've been using this journal for about 2 months now, and it is an ok journal. I know it says that it is leather, but in reality it is some weird rubbery material. I took a star off for that mainly because it says it is leather when it isn't, the rubbery material is actually not that bad. I took another star off because the binding is not that good. You cannot open this up and lay it flat without creasing the binding which makes it hard to write at times. The paper, however, is actually of a decent quality. I use a fountain pen to write in this journal and there is no bleed through, only a little bit of ghosting. For a first journal this isn't that bad, but I am not going to buy another one."
5,High quality Product,I like this Journal quite a bit. Not too large and easy to carry around--this was/is my biggest problem to keeping a journal. The size of this journal allows for me to have it with me basically all the time. I ride my motorcycle quite a bit and it fits inside my coat pocket nicely.
4,Nice Journal,"I am a minister and I like to carry a journal to write down thoughts, notes, prayer requests, peoples names, etc... This carries very well when I am at church or around the office. Seems to be durable. Would like a ribbon in it to hold my place but other than that it is perfect. The color is actually more of a burgundy than a brown. Keep this in mind if the color matters to you."
5,Excellent for Journal Writing.,"When I first received this journal I abstained from writing it, not particularly fond of the soft covers and how that would translate to writing on the go. When I ran out of journals to fill up, I turned to this one, and filled it in much faster than any of my previous journals. The paper is conducive to a variety of pens, the binding is excellent and lays flat very well, and its size makes it easy to transport anywhere (on the train, at a café, on a plane, in your hands, etc.)Due to good experience I had with this journal I have since bought and used two more journals in this size and style from Eccolo."
5,Elegant,"The soft feel of the leather binding, coupled with the tent and lines of blank pages compels you to relate the details of your day and personal history. I plan to obtain many more of these journals!!"
5,A perfect journal.,"I couldn't have asked for more in a journal. It's cheap, of high quality, and the perfect size. Love it love it love it. I might buy different styles for my next one, but if you are looking for a journal, this is a PERfect place to start."
4,Great Lessons,"Very good stories and the discussion questions really get my girls reflecting on and thinking about the story. The activities, however, while fun, don't usually seem to have much to do with the story. Would be nicer if they were more closely related."
2,Star People - 'Genius' (Hyperspace),"'Genius' is the band's second effort. Wanting to be fair to ALL disc releases that I review, for several reasons, this band just doesn't do a thing for me. I've seen them as support act for Ozric Tentacles, twice now and to be honest after their third song, I wish I hadn't shown up as early as I did.I do, however notice a Zappa-influence. But that's the only thing I thought they had going for them. Some might refer to this CD as 'lounge jazzedelic'. See what you think. Line-up: Bill Olland - vocals (reminded me of the Big Bopper), Paul Gifford - guitar, Scott Treibitz - keyboards & theremin, Randy Pratt - bass, Lorenza Ponce - violin & vocals and Phil Weiss - drums. Give it a shot."
1,"After Dragon Mountain, this?","I had just purchased Dragon Mountain, touted as an epic adventure, and found pages and pages of... kobolds? I was seriously upset. I payed serious money for this thing! Now, Axe of the Drarven Lords. Goblins? What is with this! I am looking for modules to 1) entertain, 2)intrigue, and 3) challenge my players. I find nothing entertaining, intriguing or challenging about using Goblins for players whose characters are over 3rd level.Don't buy this module if you can help it! I'd have given it 0 stars if that were an option."
4,Good,My teammates and I bought this for our coach. It is a good product. The only thing that was wrong with it was the microphone screws on the handheld would not screw and it caused it to fall apart. But we just taped it together. Either way Coach is happy with it and it still works.
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to.,"It's great for reviewing photos in sunlight. It also protects the screen.The only negative is that when it's open, I can't use the viewfinder to take pictures.Now I leave it closed while shooting."
2,Loose fit,"I have had this item for about a year. I found the folding cover easy to slip off the main frame. I inspected the unit and added a couple layers of tape as a spacer on the backside and it now holds tighter to the main frame of the unit. A more positive ""locking"" method would make this a more useful device."
2,Nice speakers but can you actually get them from Amazon?,"These speakers are pretty nice. They are clean, attractive and yield very well defined sound. In fact, for the price that I paid for them, they are quite extraordinary speakers. However, beware purchasing them from Amazon especially with the ""in stock soon"" qualification. I ordered similar speakers from Amazon and they never got them in (after months of insisting that they would be available soon.) I ended up getting these speakers for much less elsewhere and, while I'm very happy with them, I'd be very hesitant about buying them here without guaranteed delivery. Basically, the speakers are nice, but Amazon has some delivery issues regarding this brand. Do NOT get in line unless you're prepared to be disappointed."
2,cell phone headphones,"i ordered 3 sets and only one of them worked properly and it didnt last very long, but while it worked it worked great and i loved it"
1,Useless for music,"i have no idea why this is a stereo headset, since its all but useless for music (the bass is non-existent) unless you happen to spend your time listening to falsetto."
1,Broken in record time with light use.,"I ordered this about three weeks before it fell apart. The sound was neither as loud or as nice as the original set that came with the Aamsung A900. It looked nice and worked initially, so if you are really careful never to pull on the wires, no, wait, how could you not put some load on the wires? I wore it riding on the train and in the car and walking to work about twice a day, not including weekends and vacation, and kept it in my front pocket most other times, so even under light duty it is too delicate."
5,A must have,This book is a wonderful addition to anyone's bookshelf and a great source of knowledge for relaxation and a peaceful lifestyle. It has helped me enormously.
4,Works,Works as advertised at a good price. Used to repair and repaint a rusty manure spreader for small horse farm.
5,Worked Well,I used this product on surface rust on a motorcycle frame I was working on. I used two light applications as per the instructions and it worked very well. Exactly as advertised.
5,Excellent,Used it on severely rusted iron and the second coat made it look like it was covered in polyethylene and the rust was gone just a dark black/charcoal color.Reall do not have to paint if you do no wish.
1,Not the bargain it seems to be...,"Figured I'd save a few dollars and get an ""off brand"" ethernet card. It claimed to be plug-n-play; how hard could it be...?I spent two days trying to get my computer to recognize the card, to no avail. Ended up returning it, replaced it with a Linksys card. Popped the Linksys card in, and it was working in seconds, no muss, no fuss."
2,thoroughly disappointed,"I thought this book had a really great premise. But, I wasn't into the book very far when I began to jump ahead looking for the romance. I thought the idea of the Professors Lost and Found was tremendous, but, for me, it never panned out. Out heroine spent more time with her cat and more pages were devoted to it than to Michael. I realize Emma was afraid to risk kissing, but on the whole, I was really disappointed. I felt the book could have been a whole lot better. I just didn't like it. Of course, that is just my opinion, but I feel the author squandered a really good plot by not devoting a little more attention to the romance between the lead characters. I realize not every romance has to be filled with a lot of overt passion to be a good book, but after reading this, I sort of feel like I read a book about witches and magic with a little(very little!) romance thrown in."
2,only 1 out of three worked.,I ordered three of these and only 1 worked. I thought that since they were Timex that I was getting a good product. there are much better ones on the market for a better price. I am having to return them because the timer would not display anything even though the accessory plug on them works when they are plugged in.
3,Back to the dial timer,"This is a nice little timer, as long as it works. I've had quite a few of these and now over time they have all quit working.While they do their job fine when working, what I do not like about them is if the timer is in a hard to reach place, and needs to be reset one cannot a just it without being directly in front of it and often times that meant while lying on the floor with a flashlight. It cannot be reset without being plugged into the power socket. The little box is very hard to see while looking at it on the floor and having to push the various buttons to reset it is a pain in the butt.I am back to the dial timer with the two little guards that can be adjusted very easily without being plugged in."
1,Junk,"If you're looking for a cheap timer, this one is for you. The first one I bought died within a few months of purchase and Target would not replace it. Thinking it was a one-time issue, I bought another only to come home after a long vacation and find that it was no longer working. When it works, it gets the job done, but don't count on it if you're going away for an extended period of time."
2,Some of Them Tend to Stop Working But...,"I purchased two of these at the same time 4 years ago. The irony is one of them stopped working after 1-2 years (as the other negative reviews state) but the other one is still working to this day.This timer uses an internal battery (which is why it keeps the time and your settings when you unplug it).It likely stops working because the internal battery has died. You can probably open the screws on the back and buy a replacement battery at Radio Shack or the Wal-Mart.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: On the whole, I would recommend this timer simply because of its ease of use. The price is reasonable for 1-2 years or 4+ years of service. I have tried other brands and they are too complicated to use (change the time) on a daily bases. I really like the simplicity of this timer. It's as easy as setting an alarm clock."
1,One of the three I ordered did not work. We needed it for a upcoming vacation and I was disappointed.,See above. The timer did not work and had to be returned.Needs better quality control. Big inconvenience to us.
3,"great, when it works","I purchased 8 of these timers and 5 of the 8 worked. They are easy to use, but the odds of getting one that works aren't great."
2,D.O.A.,Didn't work right out of the box. You think Timex would have a quality product but not so it seems.
2,50% Defective,"Ordered 18 of these. 9 didn't work after trying to charge for several hours using multiple outlets. Also, product was different from picture (no blue on units)."
1,Don't waste your money,"As many other reviewers have stated, this unit broke after about 2 months of use. I used it for a lamp, with a 60 watt (equivalent CFL) bulb. I wanted the light to turn on for about 3 hours in the morning and about 5 hours in the evening. I don't think I was asking this little timer to work very hard. One day, it just stopped working. I have old-style timers, with the circle of pins you push in or pull out to differentiate between ""on"" and ""off,"" that I bought before I bought this timer. Those are still working, 4 years later.Don't waste your money on this timer."
1,"TWO units failed after 6 months, don't buy these!","Heed other reviews here - I bought 2 of these in April 2012 off this site, and they worked well - until they BOTH stopped working 6 months later!Quality control must be terrible - which probably expains the low price. Pay more for better quality unit, but don't buy these."
1,broke after two months,This product broke after only two months of light-duty use. I am contacting Timex support and expect to get a replacement at no cost. We'll see...
3,"one good, one bad","Replacing a similar item that had worked well (and is easy to set). Needed to buy 2 - in order to get free shipping. Pretty good deal. But only one worked out of the box, had to return the 2nd one."
1,"Lousy item, worse service","Of the five I purchased, two were DOA. I sent the two defective units to the ""repair center"" listed on the manual. They were returned today, that facility has closed. And you can't track the alleged manufacturer worth a hoot.I'm not about to spend any more money, I'll just chalk it up to a bad experience and it will be a cold day in hell before I purchase anything else Maxon/Toastmaster has had a hand in - and as far as I'm concerned, that's a black mark against Timex as well - their name is on the POS."
1,Faulty Times Digital Timer,I bought two of these timers in spite of seeing the negative reviews. Neither one worked right from the start. I followed the instructions to first charge the units but no amount of following instructions or pressing every button combination would get the digital display to appear. Amazon should take these timers off their site.
5,"GREAT Product, simple to ""program""","I purchased this product about 3 years ago. Most programmable devices require you to read a manual before you are able to use the product. This one was GREAT, I was able to program it without even reading ANY instructions. Thanks for making a product that is easy to use and works great."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star,I expected more from the Timex brand. I've had mine a year and it doesn't work anymore. Completely dead. I'm very disappointed.
1,Total junk,"Firs of all I rarely write negative reviews, but this deserves it. I bought one of these, and within a week it stopped working. While it was working it was fine, but one day it just stopped working all together and the LCD went blank. I returned it, and got a new one, and the new one stopped working within 2 days. Same result. There no reason for the malfunction as it was being used to control a 25 watt light. The Non LCD one by timex worked for a month and stopped working properly (the time was always off, even when adjusted). Try to find a different brand timer"
4,"2 years later, still working perfectly.","I bought one of these about 2 years ago, and I'm now in need of a second one. Reading the reviews here, I'm wondering if they've changed the construction or something, because the one I bought is still working as flawlessly as it did the day I bought it..."
1,Does not work,I have to agree with other reviews on here. This is a piece of junk. I just bought this timer... took it out of the package and it did not work!
1,Wish We Had Read the Reviews.....,"This timer worked for approximately two weeks. We noticed it had failed because the appliance did not go on as programmed. After many attempts to reset it, we decided to return it and report is as damaged so that it had to be removed from the merchant's inventory."
2,Defective,I ordered 2 of these. When they arrived only one work. The vendor was very cooperative and sent me a new one ... it did not work ... so at that point I had ordered 3 and one worked ... so vendor sent me another and it worked. In summary 2 of the 4 very completely defectiveI bought a 5th one ... IT DID NOT WORK
1,1003 Great Things About Friends,"Book listed as ""new"" condition, When received the flyleaf had been inscribed. That is not new but used condition and should have been noted in the description."
3,Not bad for the genre,"I love campy horror flicks, and this was worth the money I paid. The first one was good, the second one could have used better writers who knew how to research their stuff. There were a lot of mistakes. (I know, what am I doing expecting a little reality in my monster snake movies.) Anyway, still worth the money."
3,Good suspence,Goes to my collection. Had great effects. If you like fast drama on giant animals these are great. We enjoyed it
5,Anaconda and Anacondas,"These 2 movies are the best in the series with great animatronics and CGI. Great actors with great storylines. Anaconda is about a documentary crew searching for an Amazonian tribe while ""helping"" a poacher that needs a ride. Trouble starts as a crew member is fatally injured in an accident. Now they need to travel to help with the legend of the Giant Anaconda coming true. Anaconda Hunt for the Blood Orchid is about a pharmaceutical crew having to get their secret chemical for cell life fresh from the flower itself in the asian jungle of Borneo with the only Captain, and his friend, crazy enough to go down river in the rainy season. After the Doctors bribe, they crash and get stuck in the middle of the deadly proof of the secret chemical. Giant Anacondas created by prolonged cell life, meaning they have been alive long enough to never stop growing. Get these movies. It is worth it."
4,Dependable Accuracy!,This is my second purchase of this clock. After several years of service the outside monitor stopped working. I use it to monitor my greenhouse temperature in the winter season. I truly love this alarm clock. It is very accurate and very dependable. The only downfall are the instructions for set up. It's a little confusing.
2,Not Impressed,"Not impressed as it was advertised. The projection mechanism will only be visible at night when it's dark. In addition, the orientation of the projection system is limited. There are other products similar to this product's features that are far less expensive than this one."
3,A genuine connection?,"For the most part, I strongly agree with the previous review. I originally discovered Perkins when I came across ""Not Her Real Name"", a collection of brilliantly written short stories about a somewhat lost generation. I was thoroughly impressed and couldn't wait to read the follw-up. However, after reading ""Leave Before You Go"", I must say, I AM a little disappointed. While I found myself able to connect with the unwittingly emotionally bankrupt characters that she portrays, and yes, both cheering and jeering at their decision-making skills -- I felt like I was being dragged in circles. In the end, I also felt disconnected and unsatisfied -- like there was not resolution or character DEVELOPMENT at all. However, I haven't lost my faith in Perkins yet. Her uniquely tangible descriptions always leave me wanting more."
4,Very cool!,"Got this in the mail intact and looking cool as ever. Paint job is a little sloppy but its fitting :) His hat isn't attached and comes with an elastic string but who wants to use that to hold it on? It would look cheesy as hell. So it just sits on top of his head unless you choose to otherwise secure with super glue or some other adhesive. I have chose not to secure it, at least for the time being. Hilarious and really cool piece though, must have for any HO1C fan."
3,Good historical read,Great read about local politics and local women suffragistin New Waverly Tx. Great read for local political historians in Texas.
1,Tinkerbell did no fly!,Even though the other reviews were not that good I thought I would take a chance. Mistake. Tinkerbell is actually a sticker on the inside of the screen and the background is all that is supposed to move. It is an a roller that just spins around. Well this one didn't even spin. It never worked because the background was not attached to the rollers so it just mad this awful noise. Had to send it back and wouldn't even take the chance of getting one that works because it is such poor quality.
1,Don't waste your money!,"A well-meaning grandfather bought the Disney Princess version of this product for my 3-year-old daughter. It's basically the same concept as the Tinkerbell item. When we finally got it to work, I expected it to at least have some animation to it, but the figures just moved across the screen V E R Y S L O W L Y. Needless to say, this wasn't the least bit entertaining for my daughter. I'm not sure why Disney recommends this product for teenagers; other than it being a ""flat screen,"" I can't imagine why it would appeal to them. The product's construction is quite flimsy, too. Hopefully we can unload this thing at a garage sale."
5,Great book! Great pictures! Great stories!,"I first read this book when the first edition came out, and was really impressed with the depth in which the author went to gather the information for this book -- hours spent locating and contacting the surviving Munchkins, all the interviews that took place, etc. This is NOT one of my favorite movies, by any means, but I always liked the first seen in Oz, where Dorothy meets the Munchkins, and this book really showed you who these people were and how they managed to get into the movie. Alot of great pictures help make the book really stand out. With each reissue (this is the third edition of the book), the author is able to provide a little bit more information on the Munchkin actors and actresses, and provides additional pictures to keep the experience of the book fresh. I would highly recommend not just this edition, but the two previous editions if you are able to find them. A great read!"
4,Great information,A must have for every Oz oficianado. There were a lot of interesting background stories and I loved to add this to my Wizard of Oz collection!!
5,BUY BUY BUY,"Super wasy install, about ten minutes with no mods needed, one person install light and adds better look. light but sturdy feel sorry for the deer who comes across it, lol. running this on a 2000 honda passport."
1,Major disappointment,"I bought the 1lb fat replica and the 1lb muscle replica for display at my fitness studio and when I received it I have to say, I am majorly disappointed. I should have read previous reviews and saved my money. Not only is there not a dramatic difference in size (as I've seen when viewing a demo with 5lb models) but the muscle actually looks bigger. Also, When I researched to see if I could return it for a refund, I noticed it was drop shipped from a company called NASCO, which, had I bought it through them, I could have saved myself $25 on the purchase of the two. I gave this transaction 1 star because there isn't a 0 star option. I feel ripped off"
2,Not really impressed,"I purchased a one-pound fat replica AND a one-pound muscle replica. I truly thought that the differences in the sizing would be more pronounced. I gotta tell you, I really don't see that much of a difference. Theoretically, if you formed the fat into the same shape as the muscle, I'm even less impressed. Maybe these items would be good for someone in the medical field, but I just purchased them for a weight loss motivational factor - gotta tell ya - not a real motivator. I wouldn't purchase again."
5,The only kind of CD-R I recommend these days,"A long time ago IBM offered a line of CD-Rs called Choice Media. These no longer seem to exist...I'd bought 3M disks since I started using computers, and continued to buy Imation products once 3M was bought by them. I figured the CD-Rs would be good as well.The discs have held up well. I've got CD-Rs dating back to 2000 that still work reliably. I have two burners and both are able to burn these without a problem. I've seen so many of my friends lose data to Memorex and other cheap CDs. These aren't as easy to find at stores but are worth the hunt."
1,Rubbish CD-R's,"I bought these thinking that all CD-R's must be essentially the same... boy, was I wrong... I wish I had read all the other negative reviews posted here prior to purchasing... I've burned a number of music CD's so far using iTunes, and none of them work well on the majority of my CD players... they either skip or don't read at all... PURCHASE ANOTHER BRAND!!!"
2,ear bandit,"Thought this idea was going to be wonderful for my son as he has tubes in his ears and very often has problem with the whole sinus thing because of it. Unfortunately, the product would be great if only it stayed on -- yet it falls down ALL THE TIME. It is the proper size according to how you suggested measuring, although I think we could have gone smaller).ALSO - IT'S ALREADY FRAYING AND COMING APART ON ALL EDGES. It has not been used but only a few times and we certainly didn' expect this problem."
2,ear band-it,"My son is 4 and the ear band-it did not stay on his ears at all. I only used it once and it kep slipping back onto his head, not covering his ears. Not worth the money for sure."
2,Doesn't work well,We use this in conjunction with ear plugs for extra protection. Followed the directions precisely several times and this doesn't produce a good fit/moves around too much/still lets in water. On the hunt for a product that actually works.
3,Didn't Work Well,My son had surgery on his ears and needs to keep his ears completely dry. This product just didn't work well to keep the earplugs in and water out. It kept slipping off his head and he was very frustrated. We went back to using a swim cap plus the earplugs.
2,ok,"These bands work very well for holding in earplugs, but that's about it. I ordered the Large one for my 5 year old daughter, but it seems a bit too small. The wider portions don't even cover her ears. Also, the edges of the fabric are becoming very stringy and unraveling."
1,doesn't stay on my sons head,"doesn't stay on my sons head when he is playing around in the pool, don't waste you money on this"
1,Don't Buy Averetec,"This computer is extremely poor quality. I got two units and they were both defective. The customer service is also very poor. For the same price, I got a really terrific Dell whose quality is 100% better. Don't be fooled by the so-called low price and the features. This is a flimsy, badly made machine which is not worth the price."
4,Inspiring holiday story,"From the back cover:No sooner had they settled in Washington than history repeated itself: the welcoming committee of available women. The casseroles. A widower Alex McKenzie might be, but he was not looking for a new wife. His 4-year-old son, however, had picked a new mommy, just in time for the holidays. Next-door neighbor Shannon O'Rourke was striking, successful and single. Not once, though, had she come bearing casseroles. (Her two-alarm-fire attempt at baking Christmas cookies with his boy quite possibly the reason). Homemaker material or not, Shannon had resurrected his withdrawn son...when even he had failed. For that, he was tempted to kiss her. Where was mistletoe when you needed it?My Thoughts: I thoroughly enjoyed this cozy story! It's always refreshing when the focus is on the well-being of the child, rather than on the romance. And, it's inspiring to view Christmas, and life, through the eyes of the child. Very nicely done!"
3,Good product; lousy support.,"I wanted to use the Netgear GS716T and GS724T models with LANBasics OT-2201 SFP modules. The Netgear manuals say:""The two module bays accommodate standard SFP GBIC modules, such as the AGM731F or AGM732F from NETGEAR, allowing you to have fiber connections on your network."" However, there's no specific mention of MSA-compliance (MSA = Multi-Source Agreement).Netgear support was not helpful - their responses to my queries were slow to uninformative to nonexistent. Eventually, they told me that they wouldn't tell me of any SFPs other than their own, that would work with their equipment.Some manufacturers *cough* Cisco *cough* program their equipment to accept only their brand of SFPs. The above statement assured me I'd not have that problem. However, Netgear support was not cooperative; I had issues which turned out to be cabling problems, but they were of no help troubleshooting.-MrElvey"
4,Above expectations.,"For the money, these speakers have exceeded my expectations. They deliver nice sound in a small, compact size."
4,GREAt SPEAKER....,"Not really a powered system, but the sound is great..it has smooth sound..the bass is awesome, its liked a sterio, when you listen to it...works on pc,mp3 player, cd player and notebook..also is has a good price..I enjoyed this product..I recommend everybody to purchased it.."
1,You get what you pay for,These are $20 speakers. You get $20 of sound. Yes they are better than some on board speakers. Save your money and get a better set of speakers.
3,Computer generated op eye,"I enjoy having videos play in the background as I read and I thought this would be an nice change from waterfalls and ocean waves. It is different, so that's a plus. But the computer generated kaleidescopic-type images aren't varied enough to be particularly interesting and they aren't what I'd call ""pretty."" In addition, the Blu-Ray images weren't all that impressive (perhaps I've gotten jaded after having a Blu-Ray for such a long time now). Still, at about $7, it was worth adding to my collection even if I only play it once in a great while.As for the music -- I seldom listen to a video's music, so I am in the habit of simply lowering the sound level all the way. Voila -- no sound!"
4,Great art!,"Nice change from the aquarium, although great, love variety! I don't think you can go wrong with bluscenes. I love them all!"
1,won't play,I was really looking forward to this DVD. But it will not play in my simple DVD player. Neither will it play in my MAC OS. Waste of money.
5,A very big bag.,"This trumpet bag holds everything you could ever use for/with a trumpet. It is very useful for carrying my trumpet supplies and a few extra things I may need for band practice. While it is very useful and spacious, it may be a little too big. It will not fit into my locker for my trumpet at school, and is really more like a suitcase than a trumpet case. I have gotten teased by my friends who say I look like I'm going on a 10 day trip when I carry it around. It bangs around on doors when I walk through my house with it and knocks things over if I'm not careful, but it is a triple trumpet bag, so it's supposed to be large. But I carry around useful things that would never fit in a normal trumpet case, so I love it. This bag is extremely sturdy and reliable. It's really very useful and I recommend it for any dedicated trumpet player with more than one trumpet. It is a good product."
3,"A versatile bag, but a tight fit for 3 trumpets","This gig bag has plenty of room and plenty of zippered compartments for the miscellaneous items needed for a gig, but if you regularly carry three trumpets, one of them had better be a picc or you're not going to make it. For a B-flat and a flugelhorn, the bag is ideal because it's deep enough to accommodate the flugelhorn. The mute bag has ample space for a Harmon, cup, straight and plunger, but, if I'm also carrying a bucket mute, I put it in the wider end of the middle trumpet compartment. Putting it in the mute bag makes the bag far too bulky. With the mute bag attached, the gig bag can be a little unwieldy in the close quarters of a bandstand, but its overall convenience outweighs the occasional problem.JP"
1,protec deluxe triple trumpet bag,"This trumpet bag was not large enough to hold three trumpets, as advertised. My son has two full sized trumpets and a piccolo trumpet, which is much smaller, and he was unable to fit in all three. This product is not as specified."
4,Worked fine - boot up still slow,"Any time you go from 256 mb to 1 gig you're going to see a performance boost. I did. Boot up was still slow. I don't know why that is but I don't blame the RAM. Anyhow, ram is ram and this has the lowest price w/ shipping online and it's from a company I trust. I made a slow computer tolerable for under $50."
1,Reissued KGB Files and half-baked pyramid story,"Do not waste your money on this reissue of their previous release along with a new DVD consisting of a slapped-together phony documentary based on a Raiders of the Lost Ark scenario. This type of commercial release must be at least partially supported by the current Bush administration due to its obsession with wild fabrication and disinformation. Through mainstream marketing, this DVD perpetuates the government controlled media-propagated derision of those who study the UFO phenomenon along the same lines as ridiculing those who believe the 9/11 Commission and do not accept the ongoing lies put forth for the Iraq invasion."
2,Does it even support 1lb?,"I would give this product zero stars if possible, but under the circumstances I gave it brownie points for letting one of my posters stay up for this month. My mother had purchased 4 packs of Scotch Removable Mounting Squares so I can put posters and decorations up without damaging the walls of my dorm room. I had put 4 mounting squares on a poster. It literally fell within the first hour. After the first month, I got sick of it and put on 8 mounting squares. Still fell.That's not the end of the story. I had purchased a corkboard that wasn't truly that heavy. I put 8 on. it fell within the hour. I put 16 on and it within the week. I just gave up and put 3M command strips and it seems to be working fine (alas, costing me some money from my broke pockets).But, everyone's different. maybe my packages were in a horrible condition or something."
1,These didn't work!,"These did not work to hang my plain, unframed posters. I used at least 4 on each poster, after cleaning off the surface they would hang on. After about an hour, my posters had flopped off and fallen. At first I thought it was the textured cinderblock that I was trying to hang the posters on. However, after I tried hanging them with new mounting squares on the smooth wood of my closet, they still fell of within an hour. Perhaps it's the two surfaces I tried to hang posters on, but these did not work for me at all."
4,works great and safety is paramount,"Dental dams work and it helps to have the flavored kind. Gotta be safe even when having fun. doesn't change the feelings, just makes it fun."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh Warrior deck,My six year old really enjoys these cards. He plays with the neighborhood boys and his sister. He said it had a lot of cards he didn't have.
4,Red Garters,"There are very few duets that can match the talent of Guy Mitchell and Rosemary Clooney. They are superb. Set these two voices to the background of a satire story-line and you produce a classic, one of a kind movie that will last for generations. Set the whole movie on stage and you create the look and feel of todays ""computer generated graphics"" The stage setting amplifies the underlying satire of western movies and the Mitchell/Clooney music is upbeat and enlightening. The combination is enjoyable, funny and creative. Guy Mitchell's singing voice is, as always, inexplicably perfect."
2,The Sets Are So Distracting!,"This movie really has no solid storyline, poor actors aside from Jack Carson & Rosemary Clooney, and horrible sets. Don't waste your money unless you love Technicolor and Rosemary's singing."
4,Red Garters,"This was very different to what I expected, but if you are willing to think outside the box its not bad at all."
2,Only for Rosie Fans,"This movie is a stinko from one end to the other. The ""plot"" is contrived and predictable, the songs are dull- in fact I can't remember the tune or words to any of them off hand- and the only saving grace is Rosemary Clooney. Her character seems totally out of place- the one who seems more than just a cardboard cutout. If they had strung her songs together on a DVD, it would be worth the money for that."
1,oh dear,"There's a reason you never heard of this one.It's so bad that--sitting all alone--I was too embarrassed to watch it through. I'll bet that none of the participants (there were no ""actors"") includes this one on their resume. Talk about low budget. Writers were apparently somebody's third grade class. And the ""music""--if there's a hell for lyricists it's full of the song writers from this one.Painful, truly, awfully painful. Poor Rosie Clooney must have been chained to this by some tough legal knots."
3,1954 counterpunch to television - a curiosity,"A whole studio movie full of primary-colored costumes, floating fascia, stylized decor of rooms and trees. It's a surreal pacifist western musical with Guy Mitchell and Rosemary Clooney from 1954. A stranger film would be hard to find. I needed an open mind and some patience to get through it, an odd pre-widescreen color movie-stravaganza twice as silly and 10 times as expensive to make as anything on tv. Bat Masterson as a Mexican and a tap-dancing Buddy Ebsen at the cusp of playing Georgie Russell. Slick production, above average songs, very much a melodrama. Strong professional cast of talented women given much more to do than is usual in westerns. Points off for 1954-style total political incorrectitude and Guy Mitchell's unfortunately-designed riding pants, which suggest perpetual incontinence."
1,Not at all satisfied,"The first unit I got was defective, the replacement functions poorly. It loses mouse support intermittently. I would not buy this again. I ahve also had a belkin that quickly failed. All were bought as replacements for an IOgear I used to have, it funtioned great for everday use, but got liquid spilled on it :(."
5,The Benedictine Handbook,This is an awesome work. It provides a much deeper insite into the lifes of those who dedicated themselfs to living the rule
3,NOT WHAT I WANTED ON THE RULE OF ST. BENEDICT,This book was not helpful for living the spirit of the rule of St. Benedict. It would probably be good as a referene book
1,Does not work and horrible customer service,"I bought this rain gauge for my wife for Christmas. Straight out of the box it did not work. The rain gauge does nothing, and the temperature guide varies way to much. I have tried to contact customer service with no success. I did receive an E-mail from someone asking for the model and my name so that they could start the return process, but have not heard back from them in a month."
5,Need executorship skills FAST? This is THE book!,"If you are like me and find that any discussions of a financial or legal nature make you feel stupid or scared, then this book will put you at ease immediately. At a time when grief interferes with comprehension and yet when you MUST be able to perform the duties of executorship capably, this is THE book to help you. It takes you step by step calmly in plain language. All duties which an executor has to be familiar with are covered comprehensively yet in a manner that is down to earth. All legal terms that are not fully explained in the text of the book are explained in even more detail in the excellent glossary at the back of the book. Without being facetious, The book could also be called"" Executorship for Dummies."" It is THAT easy to follow and use."
3,Not a bad read,"As one who does not know much about the Rangers, I read this book to learn. I found it to be informative, and the pictures are great; but it seems to not have as much information as it could. What I mean is, for example, as far as the specifics of, let's say, training, it does not give much. There are times where the detail is great, and it definately pays homage to the Rangers and allows the reader to understand the mindset and culture; however, I just felt that it was not as informative as it could have been. Regardless, for someone who is looking for information, or at least a starting point of information, this book is a worthy addition to anyone's library."
1,HUGE!,"This thing is HUGE!!! Like bad huge, I really like it but I could never wear it without looking like trash, the pendent is about the size of an old 1/2 dollar..."
1,Second qualtiy item,"I have been using Corelle products for long time, this is my first time to purchase their dinnerware in the internet (Amazon), this was meant to be a X'mas gift, when I open to check this items, I was very surprised that they were second quality, badly made with bubbles all over around, compared to the ones I have at them, it is huge different, also, the set is so greasy, it seems there are some mechanic oil in very single dish. Very bad experience. I have to go to Walmart at the middle of night to get another set to replace this one."
2,Product has quality problems,"The set purchased by me from Amazon in November 2011. By that time, I already had the exact same set for about a year after purchasing it form WalMart. The new set has problems the original did not have: four plates are not flat, so they don't stack with others, plus one of the bowls has the green paint spills. I was surprised to see the problems in that set after not seeing any problems wit the original. Perhaps, it's jsut a bad batch, or maybe Corelle has some quality control issues."
2,Gorgeous look !,"I have ordered two of them individually and one had arrived in careful packaging and the other one wasn't packed well at all without the bubble wrapping .. it was just kept in an cardboard box and was sent out for shipping. I hope amazon works more on the packaging stuff. Other than that everything was fine, the Kobe design is simple yet elegant and better than all the other designs available from corelle. They are also pretty lightweight and easy to carry, best for everyday use. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase except the packaging in which it arrived.Review editted on 10/14/2012: I ordered this set again and I found that the mugs were broken as they weren't packed at all ! This is the second time I experienced such a thing and I still hope Amazon works out on its packaging. Even the bowls and plates weren't packed even with a paper. never order dinner sets online from Amazon."
5,Complete Idiot's Guide to Algebra,"Excellent book for someone who has either forgotten most ofthe salient ideas or just starting their math experience.The author is very empathic about the perceived ""hatred"" and""fear"" of math. He disspells these concerns thru humor andcommon sense. He gives you confidence that you can do it."
2,Derivative,"This album presents Mr. Valor, clearly a talented man, trying to imitate Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra. The songs were composed with the bedroom in mind-- but alas, the lyrics fall far short of romanticism or eroticism. They are actually cringe-inducing at points. Valor's insistence in singing in the lower registers, a la Barry White, have his vocals out of his range. He ends up growling rather than singing many of the notes. His normal vocal style is lounge singer (Holiday Inn?) When co-vocalist Carol Williams comes on, her voice sounds so clear and her tone is so beautiful that the listener regrets what the album could have been. The instrumentation and arrangements are quite good at times-- ""Love Has Come My Way"" is actually a solid composition whose lyrics and male vocals spoil. ""Dame Esa Cosa"" is the other extended song, and because it is largely instrumental, it fares best. It is more jungle-oriented than the traditional orchestral disco of the other tracks."
1,Room for improvement,I also have this DVD set and think that too much time was spent on the interface. I was very dissapointed that there really wasn't any practical guidance offered in regard to creating titles with Graffiti.
5,"The best CD I was told to buy, without listening to it first!","This is for fans of the experimental alternative of the early 90's. It has guitar hooks and bass riffs as if they were in the Dead Kennedy's. The drummer has some of the best timing that I've ever heard, while the singer reminds me of a more coherant poly styrin (x-ray spex). The real treat is that there is a trumpet player in the band who wails every time it's heard. Great for a party or a night alone with a 10 strip of acid."
5,Perfect!!!!,I have been looking for this book for a long time. The author sold it and he even signed it for me. Great book!
5,scared me,"Stories are read great and are truly scary, even for adults. Too violent to use for school though."
5,Best Way the Story Can Be Told,"Pros- Excellent story teller. Slow when needed, Fast when needed, Quiet when needed, Loud when needed.- Perfect type of music played at the right time.- Really recommended for teachers to play in an elementary school during Halloween.Cons- When playing CD, sometimes hard to tell when a track ends or starts. You can't tell whether the new story is part of the previous story or not.Just a Note- One of the things that made the book scary were the creepy drawings. The audio CD attempts to be creepy without the drawings.- Has nothing to do with the audio, but the story itself is somewhat on the cheesy side. It will only scare kids younger than.. say 13."
4,A Blast from the past,This is a great set of stories for kids to read. They are not too harsh yet still have the ability to make even the bravest kid jump.
5,Great!,"I own this, and the collection put into one book, and the audio set. I love it, its scary im 15, and im telling you this book will at least freak you out. Not really the stories (although they are pretty freaky) but the pictures are truly frightening. My favorite perhaps is 'Harold' Thats a wild story, i wish they would make it longer though. Anyways I believe this book has been banned from a few schools. So i would make it at least ten and up. lol but you can go ahead and read it even if ur not that old, its still fun."
4,A favorite,"This book is also one of my husband's childhood favorites. We were having trouble find original copies of it so were glad to find this one. It was listed as ""new"" but did have blacked out writing on the inside cover. It would have been better listed as used in good condition due to this. Despite these marks the book seemed to have not been opened but a few times which made up for the markings."
4,"Good books, a little different",Loved these stories as a child and still love them today. They are well written and alot of fun. The only thing that was kind of a put-off was the fact that that they changed the illustrations. The new ones are good and all but the classic one had a much creepier feel that fit the books better. Still a great buy for any one who remembers the from their childhood or just wants some fun scary stories.
3,I was more intrigued than scared,"I recall reading this delightful bunch of short stories about strange folktales, camping stories and things that happened in the woods at night. I liked the illustrations and the way some of the stories questioned the existence of the afterlife, these books were banned from the library because parents thought that the subject matter was too gory and bloody and graphic and that it talked about religious ideas such as where the soul goes after the body had died."
5,Scary good fun for kids of all ages.,"I remember reading at least the first book as a kid and then the books as a young teenager. The pictures that were in the book were pretty gross, but effective. I bought the cd version of thse books to hear how they sounded when preformed. I preformed one of the stories out of the second book in this series in high school and I scared the crap out of one of the girls that was in the audience, because they put a spot light on her right at the end of the story. I told ""Bloody Fingers"" at a family reunion several years ago, during a ""Scary story contest"" that my family was involved in that year. I have also given a copy of this cd set to one of my two goddaughters when she was about 8 or 9 years old and she was THRILLED to get it, not to mention that it wasn't even the little one's birthday. I distinctly remember the little one saying ""Cool -- 'Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark' CD set!! My older brothers will be SO JEALOUS of me!!"""
1,No Stephen Gammell?,"The original version of these books rates a solid 5 stars, but these new editions missing the original artwork of Stephen Gammell are worthless. Get the Scary Stories Treasury instead."
1,The artwork made it,"Whenever you mention Scary Stories, the consensus among anyone who has ever read them is that the art made everything. The stories were decent, but the art with them is what made the stories stick in your mind.Why the publishers would remove the most memorable part of a book makes no sense to me. The new art looks like Harry Potter artwork, which would be fine if Hogwarts was somehow terrifying."
1,sad,"The original illustrations are why I sought these books out for my kids. When I read these growing up, they creeped me out even more by the artwork. Now it's as if I'm reading Harry Potter. Not to say that that's bad, but it's supposed to be ""SCARY STORIES"" PEOPLE! Why change this now after nearly 30 years? Epic fail."
3,It's just missing something,"While the stories are the same as I remember from the days when I checked these books out of my elementary school library, they just aren't the same without the original illustrations by Stephen Gammell. The new illustrations look great and are very professional, but they lack the impact of the originals. Perhaps the publisher though the original illustrations were too scary? If so, it's a real shame."
4,A Christmas gift for my wife,"Looked high and low for this item, finally found a dealer I was willing to do business with. Others didn't list a specific description of the product, filling the space instead with a generic sentence. I paid more than what the other guys were selling it for, but felt more confident in my purchase."
2,Would have been scary when I was a kid,"I got this for a camping trip after reading several reviews that the stories would be scary for adults too. Definitely not the case, in fact you sit there wondering how they could end these stories like they do. I mean you're waiting for the conclusion but it never comes. They start the next story and you're sitting there like what the heck? There were a couple of good stories but the group I was with ended up laughing because they couldn't believe we were actually listening to these. Get it for the children but spare the adults. The stories are just too shallow for adults to enjoy."
4,Tales from the Crypt Scary,"These are great sitting around a campfire kind of stories (which is where I read them), but I can't say that I would actually just sit and read them. They aren't scary like Poe or King. Just creepy and pretty predictable. But aren't all campfire stories?"
5,Great!,"The book arrived on time, in the condition that I was told, and for a great price. Excellent seller AND product!"
4,LOVE THE STORY BUT HATE THE SELLER,I order this almost three weeks ago and still nuttin not even in the mail yet.. i wanted this for my son from the gobblins on hallows eve but it s not gonna make it thank !!!!!
1,Wish I would have know they changed ALL the illustrations . . .,"The stories are great, but not at all as creepy without Gammell's illustrations.I wish it would have been posted somewhere, clearly, that they altered such a vital aspect of these books. I read them as a child and bought this boxed set for my kids. I thought they just had a random artist illustrate the box they put them in as you cannot see the books themselves. I didn't bother reading customer reviews because I knew it was the correct author and I never fathomed that they could alter a book in such an extreme downgraded fashion. I was very disappointed and had to purchase the original works on Ebay.Why on earth would they stop printing the originals? How can they pass these books off as the same ones I read as a kid?"
3,Disappointed,I'm giving the new versions 3 stars because I loved the stories. I am very disappointed they changed the original art work. While the new art work is good it can never replace the old art work. The kids that pick these books up for the first time will be truly missing out on amazing art.
4,Review,"As I was growing up, these books were the scariest. Since then, I haven't found any that have given me more chills. They are simple, yet terrifying. I recommend these stories to anyone who wants to experience the same chill."
5,A masterpiece...,"I remember reading these books as a kid. They scared the heck out of me. Now, 10 years later, I still find myself rummaging through the pages often. But aside from the great stories, the one thing that truly makes this series shine is the artwork. Stephen Gammell is truly one of the most talented artists when it comes to the strange and spooky. This boxed set is *definatly* worth getting."
1,"If it isn't broke, don't fix it!","These series of books have a classic collection of horror folk and urban legend stories and have been around for over a decade. I have fond memories from reading these stories as a child. But what put these books over the top was the original disturbing artwork by Steven Gammell, which is sadly no longer present in these new editions and needs to be brought back. Replacing the classic illustrations was a very dumb move on the part of the publisher. If you can, track down the older editions with Gammell's illustrations they are well worth it and vastly superior. They are no longer in print, but copies are still plentiful and not too hard to come by."
1,Who's terrible idea was this?,"Someone made a very bad call when reissuing these books. No personal slight to Mr. Helquist who, I'm sure, does fine illustrations for many other books...but this series is meant to be illustrated by Stephen Gammell. It's a team effort. Schwartz and Gammell, Gammell and Schwartz. It's an iconic pairing and it shouldn't have been changed. So, if you can find an older version of this series, or can wait a few years for the publisher to realize their mistake and reissue the books with the original illustrations. Do that instead."
4,Scary Stories to Tell In The Dark Audio CD Collection Review,These three CDs are fun to listen to. The story teller is good at making the scary stories interesting and fun to listen to. My only problem with this audio collection is that not all of the stories are included from the trilogy of scary story books by Alvin Schwartz.
1,What a bunch of bull.,"I am not someone who loves scary stories. But if I can find a good one, then I will read it. I read these as a child, and I still have nightmares about one of the illustrations. The stories are extremely frightening, and the illustrations are disgusting. Some of the stories are completely distasteful and should not be read by any child under 12. PERIOD."
1,Super Freaky!,"First, of all I didn't give it a one because its horrible, I gave it a one because Alvin Schwartz stories are REALLY creepy. And I agree with danny the illustrations are freaky, those alone would make me want to burn the book. And I've reached the college level age and I'm still affraid of those books! lol I have a very low tollerence for horror of any kind....... Some stories aren't that scary their just pretty weird folklore...Like the story of the WolfGirl in vol. 3. Or the Hog... Though Harold was a freakish story....the pictures are the main reason though... ::shivers:: college student and still afraid...lol"
4,All You Need to Know About Caribbean Music...Great Reading!,"Probably one of the best introductory books written on the history, evolution and development of Caribbean music. Professor Manuel covers, with enough in-depth analysis, the ""roots"" and history of the music of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad, Suriname and other small islands.The book is well written and an easy read, as well as being informative, giving the reader an overview of Caribbean music. It is not all-inclusive of the ""Caribbean Basin""...it does not include the music of Central America, Mexico and Venezuela. Nevertheless it is a book I highly recommend to anyone that is interested in obtaining an overview on Caribbean music from its beginnings to the different genres of today."
2,DOESN'T LAST,"This is the exact same clock Radio Shack sells.I've had two of these,both defective.The 2nd one started randomly loosing time.Reset lasts for a couple days and then goes south again."
2,chewy,Apples and strawberries were crunchy and satisfying. Pears were chewy and suspect as we were expecting crunchy.. Support from company was ok as they replaced however replacement pears still soft.
3,Disappointed,"I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added. I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?"
3,Strange chewy-crunchy texture,"Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are ""good"" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces."
5,These are delicous,"These are delicious, they did not last long. I brought them into work and between me, my coworkers and a 5 year old, they were gone. The selection of fruits in the mix is well balanced and they are easy to take with you (if you get the chance) in the bags."
1,"NOT crunchie, soft like styrofoam","These are terrible, I struggled through eating the first bag, then just tossed the other bags. I opened the first bag and handed these out to my coworkers to ensure it was not just me, but there is unanimous agreement, terrible and NOT crunchie, as the namesake suggests. The texture is like rubbery styrofoam. The only thing I can say is these are yucky rubbery artificial-like taste. Maybe it is freeze-dried strawberries that just taste like this, but I will not be ordering freeze-dried strawberry anything after getting a taste of these."
4,Delicious - But They Stain!,"I love blueberries & love the taste of these.Light as air and not sugary like many dried fruits, so they are a little tart.Problem: Will stain your fingers, tongue, teeth and anything else they touch. :-("
2,Not worth the money,"I wanted to like these and was excited to get them at a good price here. My boys liked them, but one whole package from the variety box wasn't enough for them. There was about enough larger chunks to fit in my palm, the rest was tiny crumbs and powder. Very disappointing and I won't be buying it again. Trader Joe's has some options that go farther for less money."
5,Great!,"Yummy, healthy fun snack. Great whether you eat them right out of the bag or put them in cereal, yogurt whatever. Highly recommend."
4,Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit,"Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy. All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans. Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape. Excellent, healthy snack :)Update: For Pears... (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely. They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item). The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again."
2,paper,"Crunchies Strawberries is not crunchy at all. Moreover, it tastes like paper. It's not tasty compared to other brand of freeze-dried fruits."
1,Not consistant,I have had freezed dried blueberries before so I had an expectation. Some of them were crunchy(like they should be) and others were the consistancy of styrofoam. More were of the chewy foam type. I would not purchase these again.
3,Tasty but skins separate from berries to make blue powder,"These were decent, but a lot of the blue skins of the blueberries were just blue powder in the package after they came of the berries and got crunched up during shipping etc. They were nice and crunchy with decent flavor for freeze dried berries."
2,Not Crunchy at all! More like chewy and mostly strawberries,"I guess these are just ok but the choices from Crispy Green are much, much better! I was hoping the name would be accurate, crunchy, but nope. The pieces were stuck together and kinda chewy. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,Not tasty,"I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy."
1,Horrible,we had tried freeze dried apples at the office and they went off the shelf like crazy! Loved them! and then we tried CRUNCHIES BRAND. They are certainly not crunchy. Soggy and they tasted like they were old. We were exceptionally dissapointed returned them back to amazon. People that recommend this have no taste what so ever!!!
1,"Some crunch, Mostly not crunchy","Very disappointing. I enjoy freeze-dried strawberries, but not these. My first pouch was quite sour, with little strawberry flavor. The texture is hard to describe...a bit like styrofoam that packs down in to a sticky mess. I'm still trying to get strawberry out where the pieces have stuck on and between my teeth. Very unpleasant. I will try another pouch, maybe this one wasn't sealed correctly. Or try the strawberries in cereal. At this point I wouldn't recommend these as a snack for anyone."
2,Not what I expected,Not what I was expecting and will not order again. I was looking for dried fruit. This product was powdery and what wasn't was hard.
1,Taste like artificial little fluffy cardboard,I bought these - based on the great reviews.They're horrible - taste artificially sweetened and there's a powdery substance left in the bag.I wish I hadn't bought these...waste of money.If they weren't so expensive I'd just throw the rest away...
1,Not good!,This product is no Good you need and have to go to where they package..They don't even have health permit to package at the wearhouse and people still buy...Very unhealthy with no health permits at all. Please be carefull with this product very unhealthy..
1,"Odd texture, poor taste","The texture reminds me of a cheese puff and the taste, ick! What a waste of money. I threw away the one bag I opened and will donate the other bags to charity."
1,Never got them,"A little disappointed with Amazon here because although they advertise them, never got them and have received messages about delays three times so cancelled the order. I would have liked to try them. I usually love Amazon for just about EVERYTHING - and the shipping is absolutely wonderful - but not in this case. :-("
1,NOT CRUNCHY,"Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months. They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states ""IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA"". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together. They probably cooked during shipping and are not a ""Raw Food"" and not as ""Nutritious"" anymore. Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened. Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns. It was a waste of $40."
3,An interesting snack,"I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the ""Tropical Fruit"" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the ""Organic Strawberries"" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate."
4,"Tasty, but messy","These are very good, but too messy to eat alone as a snack. The blueberries stained my fingers and mouth. They are very good mixed with yogurt or in muffins. Normally, they are a little pricey, but with the instant rebate, they are well worth the cost."
3,Overprice,"Its really little in a packet, definitely overpriced. Not worth buying it. The fruits doesnt taste great either, will not be buying it again."
2,Crunchy? More like stale O.o,"Usually I buy freeze dried pears from whole foods but it costs an arm and a leg so I was SUPER excited to see this available at a decent price.Disappointment doesn't even come close...The pears weren't crunchy in the slightest bit, more like stale and chewy in such a way that it brought about a slight ""ick"" factor. I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight ""ick"" taste and no one will eat it. Whatta waste :("
4,Taste great!,"I bought these for my 12 month old son. He loves blueberries so I thought these would be great to have on the go or when we don't have fresh berries to eat. They're a little crunchy then the other kinds they make, and do stain your hands, but they still taste great."
2,not what i expected,"I understand the benefits this product offers, but what it lacks is taste appeal. Kind of like eating a little bit of flavored air. It is lacking a palatable texture. There is some flavor, but not what I expected. Very costly per ounce,$3 for 1.5 oz. It may take8-10 lbs of fresh fruit to make 1 lb of crunchies, but for flavor, texture, and cost, I will definately buy 8-10 lbs. fruit. Sorry I am unable to return the other 5 bags."
5,If your willing & able to pay the price...,"My 2 year old can't get enough of these. Anytime we have a playdate, the other child also devours them. Pricey, but worth it if you're looking for a healthy snack- especially for picky eaters."
2,:(,I usually buy these at whole foods and the quality is excellent. The raspberries are tart just like I like them. I ordered these online at a much better price and the raspberries didn't taste the same :( barely any tartness. I was very disappointed! will no t buy again
1,waste of money,"Most of the berries are powder and strawberries, very few bags had black berries and blue berries worth noting. Disappointing"
3,"alright, but try another brand","i've been enjoying the ""just Tomatoes"" brand of dehydrated fruits for a while and decided to branch out. Crunchies are alright, but my packets were a little more chewy than crunchy. perhaps a little stale or this is just how their fruit is. whatever the reason, for the same price, the 'just tomatoes' fruits are more crispy, tart, and delicious."
2,Way too small,"I found it to be a little too pricey for the size. If it was double in size, then it would have been worth the money."
5,Bright colorful taste,Even though it's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor. In this way it's even better than standard dried fruit.
2,Not Crunchy!,I've purchased these in stores and they are crunchy and delicious. I ordered from amazon and they were chewy and disappointing. I guess I'll go back to buying them locally since what amazon shipped was inferior product.
3,"some good, some not...","some of these survived shipping ok. some were 90% pulverized dust by the time they got to my home. Would buy again, just not sure I would order these again from Amazon (usually these are very good from the local stores)."
2,Feel Kinda Ripped Off,"Because of the bulk price and the main image on amazon, I thought the packages would be larger, like a bag of Jerky. Turns out that the image you see is not the packaging that you get, the bags are shorter and smaller (see my customer image). At over $4 a bag ($25/6), I'd be better off buying freeze-dried fruit at the local nutrition shop. Plus the fruit pieces are fairly small; good for kids but I like bigger chunks."
4,Wonderful in cereal,"Perfect to throw in cereal except the larger chunks do not soften up. Taste very good. Overall, I'm satisfied & will purchase again."
2,Lacks flavor,"I love this brand of freeze dried fruit but found the mango variety to lack flavor...unlike mango juice itself. Maybe when you take the ""juice"" out of this fruit it's just dried fiber. Not satisfying."
5,Really good - little powdery but good,"These taste wonderful. They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating. Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good. I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries. There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup. These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.Highly recommended."
4,Crunchies Freeze-dried Tropical Fruit,"I think this product is very good. I have had some better freeze dried fruit. I would prefer if the pieces were bigger, but other than that it is a could product."
3,Very Good Taste.... Lots of Empty Space....,You get more air in the package than fruit at a premium price. Taste is very good and I would be more apt to buy again for about half the price.
2,Crunchies are not crunchy,"This product is tastey but it is not ""Crunchy"" so I'm not sure where they got the name. If you are looking for a freeze-dried crunchy strawberry you will have to get Cereal Toppers which I don't think are offered on Amazon. These Crunchies are good on cereal with milk. My four year old likes them but I'm not crazy about the soft texture. Just Tomatoes brand has dried stawberries on this website that are better."
2,"Sands Lost his life, but did win Weightwatcher of the year!","As a briton of Irish descent I do perhaps have a better idea of the IRA than americans of irish descent. The Facts are:1. They belonged to an organisation that has killed over 2000 men, women and children, both catholics and protestants.2. They were provided with food and chose not to eat it.3. The IRA seek to establish minority rule over the unionist population ie apartheid.This book is articulate and well written, but is total and utter propaganda."
1,"making heroes out of ""animals""","I read this book out of curiousity to find out what the author was writing about. Here we have 10 vicious humans, (I hate to use the term animals as it insults the animal kingdom) These people were inside for a reason, and in the end they got what they deserved and what the courts should have issued them with in the first place. The true bravery in this case is the bravery of Margaret Thatcher and the forces of law and order in northern Ireland who would not give in to these peoples demands. Mrs Thather stood up to enormous pressure from everyone and did not buckle, the true hero of this case"
5,An excellent CD for meditation,"This is a excellent CD if you want to meditate. When I played this CD it makes me feel that I am traveling to a different place. If you meditate often with or without aids, I recommend this CD to take you on a journey to different dimensions."
4,Mediative/Yoga CD,"The music flows endlessly, but it's too bad that the same song is replayed on the CD instead of a different one. This CD should be priced lower."
5,Slight correction to Adam David's review,"I agree with most things the first reviewer, Adam, said about this CD. However, the second cut is NOT the first cut repeated. Oh, I admit one has to be paying quite a lot of attention to tell the difference, but they are two different albeit extremely similar pieces. Perhaps I've been listening too much and too closely. I've given it five stars because it's great for yoga, concentration and relaxation. But if you don't have the patience and stillness for trance-inducing music, this sort of thing will drive you crazy and make you fidget and you'll wonder how anyone could have given it even a piece of a star."
4,Expensive Books,This and four other books required for the CFA level I exam are priced a lot more than that offered by the AIMR
2,...,"Some of the mistakes in the book, especially vis-a-vis swaps and swap options make parts of the book virtually useless. This is supposed to be a text book written by an authority in the field, how do basic mistakes in logic and nomenclature make it through the editing process?"
4,Good Coverage of Several Types of Financial Derivatives,"""Futures, Options and Swaps"" offers good coverage of several major types of financial derivatives (futures, options and swaps). This book was a core reading for one of the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) examinations when I took such examinations a number of years ago...a strong suggestion that this is an authoritative publication in the financial sector.Robert Kolb does a good job covering the subject matter from the perspective of how to accomplish something with a future, option or swap. Moreover, Kolb makes a point of consistently offering commentary as to why one might use a certain financial instrument for a given task/problem.For those readers with an interest in learning more about futures, options and swaps, this is a good source of information."
4,not a significant upgrade,"Except for the chapter by Stu Bergman, almost nothing has changed from the previous edition. The previous edition was good but there is essentially no updating. I could not locate any reference to BRONJ- a huge oversight. SAVE YOUR MONEY if you have the 2nd ed. Otherwise, it's still okay.I have returned it."
3,NOT for Hispanics,"This book is for McLennan County and Eastern Coryell County ONLY. There are very few Hispanic surnames. The only Hispanic surnames are: Arenas, Quiroz, Rozales, Zapata. If anyone would like me to do a surname lookup (Hispanic or otherwise) from the book, you can e-mail me lorraine dot schultz at yahoo dot com99% of the surnames are English/Irish surnames, a few German and Scandinavian surnames.The entries do have citations, however the author cautions that the records were transcribed from handwritten notes, so be aware of possible misspellings etc.The predominant source is the ""McGregor Mirror"". If these counties and newspaper are your area of interest then you would rate this a five. Otherwise, save your dineros and look for an on-line source.Original review 04-06-2006Updated 08-15-2006 to add clarity and to reflect e-mail change. las"
5,LOVE!,I've had this bracelet for a while now and absolutely LOVE it. My wrists are a bit on the small side and I was so happy that this didn't just slip right off. It looks great nad is really comfortable to wear everyday. The jade is pretty and not too big (not too small either).
5,Readers will discover the many expansive possibilities generally not seen by the novice entrepreneur in starting a business,"In Cracking The Network CODE; 4 Steps To Priceless Business Relationships by progress agent Dean Lindsay, readers will discover the many expansive possibilities generally not seen by the novice entrepreneur in starting a business of their own. Cracking The Network CODE enables the mastery of many skills, going about the matter with the varying angles including: ""37 Questions for Defining a Powerful Networking Plan"", ""9 Strategies for Opening Face-to-Face Relationships"", ""16 Examples of Proven Places to Network"", and a great many more. Cracking The Networking CODE is particularly recommended reading for those engaged in business, sales, and marketing, as well as corporate-level management responsibility or engaged in career development."
2,No Surprises,"With the other reviews I read before buying this book, I thought this must contain some groundbreaking techniques, but I was surprisingly disappointed instead. It was more like hyped-up motivational stuff, along with fairly obvious advice along the lines of: Be outgoing, be nice to people, be interested in others, be helpful, present yourself well, etc. I can't say this isn't good advice, but it's not exactly breakthrough. The author also continuously throws in various odd trademarked slogans like ""Be Progress"". If someone needs basic motivation to get out and confront talking to people, and present themselves well, maybe this book is helpful. Perhaps there isn't a lot more to this subject that anyone could write a good book about.2009 Update:I've since found a couple of books on networking that gave some nice techniques and insight:Networking with the Affluent by Thomas StanleyLittle Black Book of Connections by Jeffrey Gitomer- Earnest Entrepreneur"
4,Extremely focused and to the point,"I usually reserve top ratings for books that I feel can really change my life. Well this book got close and like a lot of other reviewers opinions, there aren't too many new ideas in this book. However, it's the delivery of the networking message that sets this book apart. The author did a tremendous job of cutting all the fat out of the subject and getting to the point quickly. I appreciate that and thank him for being direct and respectful of time. So if you are looking for a book to teach you the important points of networking, this is a great start."
5,"Great advice, great value","This book is an enjoyable, fast-paced read, but will give you a lot to mull over. It is full of advice you can put to use immediately, and if you do, your life will be richer.Dean really puts a new spin on the idea of networking: that you need to do for others first and make their progress your goal. If you think that networking is only for the selfish and the smarmy, this book is for you."
1,The good news is....Its short,"I find it truly horrifing that to see all these great reviews. Unlese you are a from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, you are not going to find this helpful. The only thing I can think of is the author has networked well enough to get his associates to give this book good reviews.The author, in a sad attempt to connect with the reader would include pop culture snippits so that maybe you would think that the book is as good as the seinfield episode that he refered too. Sadly though my HitchHickers Guide to the Galexy reference in this review is a more deft reference that could ever hope to make.This is another self help book that does just that, help the author."
4,Great Clock,"I've had this atomic clock for about two weeks and love it. The main selling point for me is the fact that it automatically sets itself. I just happen to be one of those people that needs at least one clock in their home to show the correct time! The other features are very nice as well. Indoor/outdoor temps, day, date and moon phase are pretty nice to have all in one clock. Also the display is very large and easy to read. My one small complaint is that the temperature reading has frozen on me once. I knew my home wasn't staying at exactly 80.6 F for two days (it's normally around 74)so I just had to remove and then reinsert the batteries and then things seemed to work fine."
3,Outdoor display quit working,I also have the same problem. The outdoor temperature display quit working. Changed batteries and put them in the order in which the instructions said to no avail. Did anyone get a response from the manufacurer on this problem? I cannot find my receipt. I'm sure it has more than a 2 year warranty??
4,weather channel atomic clock,"The display (moon phases) could be more crisp and better lit, the clock went on sale for 1/2 price right after I got it. Bummer dude. I really feel cheated. I wished I had shopped more, Walmart had the same clock and it was cheaper."
5,very nice,"I bought this about a month ago mainly because I wanted both the inside and outside temperatures displayed. The outside temperature sensor fits easily between an outside window and a screen, without using any screws or tape, and reports both temperatures very accurately. The moon phase indicator seems pretty useless (who cares?) but is interesting nonetheless. I live in NY and it keeps the time perfectly."
4,"Good Clock, Bad Package, get it anyway!","this clock is great. atomic clock feature is great, and the clock sets itself. included temperature gauge mounts outside, and is fairly accurate. moon phase indicator is entertaining but unnecessary, IMO.packaging was horrid. box was ripped, dented, and scuffed all up. this was a gift for my girlfriend (who, thankfully, isn't superficial). but the box looked like crap. looks like it was in the stockroom forever, and dragged out and shipped. poor package, great product."
3,A Decent Clock,"The first clock that arrived did not function correctly as it would not pick up any reading from the remote sensor and would not set the date or time on its own. After returning the first item and receiving a new one, the clock is now functioning as advertised thus far."
4,Excellent weather station/clock,"This clock and weather station is excellent. At first I had a little trouble syncing it to the atomic time, but once I set it I've never touched it again. I placed the temperature sensor outside about 20-30 feet away and it has always given me accurate temps. The indoor temp reading is basically exactly the same as the thermostat in the house says.The clock is very well made and looks beautiful on the wall. We've had the clock for well over a year now and have not once changed the batteries."
4,Not very accurate thermometer,"I bought a similar clock a few years ago and loved it, so when these became available three months ago for $20, I bought two of them.I have to say that I've had no problems with the time feature. It seems to be accurate, and I love that it automatically changes with Daylight Savings.However, the thermometer feature is slightly inaccurate. As I said, I have three of these clocks, and none of them agree exactly on the indoor or outdoor temperature. Assuming that the clock with the median temperature is accurate, I have one clock that always shows temps about 1.0 degrees colder, and I have another clock that shows temps about 2.5 degrees warmer. Now, a 1.0 or 2.5 degree difference may not be much, but that means there's a 3.5 degree difference between two of my clocks.I still think these clocks are great for the average home user, and I would buy another one immediately if one broke, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone needing a truly accurate temperature reading."
4,"Looks great, works great.","All I had to do was insert the batteries. I chose to let the atomic clock signal set the time, date, and moon phase for me. At midnight, everything was perfect and has been so since the first night. It's is important to put the outdoor sensor in a spot sheltered from the rain and direct sunlight. The cherry wood accents on the indoor monitor add a real style."
2,problems with the remote temperture sensor,Loved the clock! But have had alot of problems with the remote tempeture display.Quits working and has required changing of the batteries quite often.Last batteries we put in quit working the next day. Am sure that there is a reason for this but we have yet to find it.
3,Weather Channel Atomic Wall Clock,"While I'm sure most would have no problem with this item, that wasn't the case for us. We live on the side of a hill, and I believe our signal was blocked by the hill and trees in the area. At least that's my theory!We followed the instructions - to the letter - numerous times and did not meet with success. Of the five different displays available we would only get two or three. Sometimes time and weather, sometimes time and temp. you get the idea."
1,My perspective,The box looked like it had been in a trash can. The indicated temperature (outside) is about +/- 5 degrees from a standard thermometer. The clock seems to be kept on time by WWV.
4,Weather Channel Atomic Clock,This is one of my best purchases in my lifetime. The front feature is stylish and appealing. I love seeing the temperature outside and the time is in big digits making it easy to view. It has the date stamp and moon phase. I love this thing.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This item from Lacrosse never worked right from the beginning. Do not waste your money on Lacrosse products. You will be sorry! I do not make a habit of bad mouthing a company, but their products are terrible! Buyer Beware!! This deserves 0 stars!!"
5,Influential communication,"The contents of this book will assist all who use it to eliminate the common errors associated with daily communication. Great advice on e-mail brevity, selecting the proper word etc. Well worth reading."
4,Very interesting and helpful in my daily work.,"Very good. I recommend it to international business developers in all sectors of activities, regardless nationalities and/or countries where to perform."
3,Ok,"To general. You can obtain most of this information in your word program. It wasnt very helpful at this time,"
3,train is ok for price,this train falls off the track alot especally the front wheels. the train itself is ok quality. no problems except derailments.
1,Just another typical garbage rock band,"Although they could be a great band, they have a long way to go. THere songs are boring, and not catchy. But, if you like early 90's rock..get this cd"
1,Not compatible,"This item was ""recommended"" by Amazon for purchase along with The Grace Internet radio. Unfortunately, as of July 10, 2012 it's not compatible with the radio. Order the adapter directly from Grace if you want it to work the first time."
4,Works - simple as that.,"Product is good, and actually works.I purchased one of those $5 ones here on Amazon a while back, and it didn't work at all.If you're willing to pay the $30 something for this, then you will have something that guaranteed should work.Just pop in the CD, install the drivers and you're good too go.Note: I did order 2-day shipping, and it came in 3, so slightly annoying, but eh, the product works, so I'm happy."
2,Not Friendly to Windows 98SE,"This item was purchased to upgrade an older Toshiba laptop having a 98 OS and no RJ45 port. The Toshiba meets/exceeds system requirements of this TRENDnet Adapter. I installed/verified the win98 driver according to the TRENDnet instructions and then tried to restart the laptop. The OS froze up completely. Nothing worked. I could not shut it down, or take any other action. Finally, I disconnected AC power and ran on the battery power until it was exhausted. Only then could I plug in AC and restart the laptop. I tried installing the TRENDnet driver 3 more times and had the very same result each time. I gave the unit 2 stars because of the very neat packaging and appearance of the unit. I will keep it in case one of my 2 other Toshibas(XP and Vista)developes a broadband connect problem."
1,at first ..,At the moment I cannot get this product to work...bought it for my sis computer while visiting...and tried to install it only 1 day before I left (2 days ago)...so was unable to do a proper troubleshoot to see if it was indeed the item at fault.Will do an update .
4,TRENDnet TU2-ET100 H/W: V3.0R no driver required for Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.6,"I bought this to use with Macbook Airs, but my MBA is at home so I connected it to the front panel USB port of a Dual G5 running 10.5.6. A dialog stating that a new network port had been detected came up and asked if I wanted to configure it, which I did by copying the settings from built-in Ethernet. I switched the Ethernet cable and tested it by visiting a few websites, printing to an appletalk laser printer, and copying files to and from a local Leopard server. I'm not going to run any benchmarks, but I will say I could use this as my everyday NIC if the built-in Ethernet port stopped working. It comes with a CD that has drivers for Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 and Panther 10.3, which I did not test. It also comes with a Quick Install Guide for Windows, which directs you to the cd for Mac instructions, which you may need for Tiger or Panther."
1,Does not work or have drivers for Win 7 or Vista.,I bought the TU-ET 100C and for operating systems after Windows XP it will not work. There are no drivers for Windows 7 or Vista for this device. I am a computer professional with a degree in Computer Information Systems and build and fix computers. I think I will try the Cisco as soon as I find a place it says that it is Win 7 compatible.
4,Works great with our Nintento Wii,"I bought this as an alternative to the official Nintendo Ethernet adapter. It works great as a cheaper, yet effective alternative."
3,TRENDnet USB to 10/100Mbps Adapter TU2-ET100,This item arrived earlier than scheduled and did the job I needed it to do. I required an additiional LAN port for a camera that needed a static IP address. I ran this configuration until I had a better solution a few weeks later. It did the job intended.
5,Saved my Tivo,"After lightning took out the modem in my Series 2 Tivo I mistakenly re-initiated the guided setup. Without being able to connect to the Tivo servers, I was not able to complete the setup and not able to use my Tivo. With this adapter I connected my Tivo to my home network. The Tivo did not require any additional setup to recognize this adapter or connect to my network (cable modem - Internet connection). Within minutes my Tivo was back online and working."
4,"Works fine, light weight, a bit bulky","I use this adapter with my Viliv X70 ultra mobile PC, which has no ethernet port. The adapter works fine. It also is very light weight so that taking it on trips adds nothing to my load. My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky for its function. The adapter measures 1.75""x1""x3"", not including the cable. The ethernet socket contained in the adapter is less than 1""x0.75""x0.75"", so I am sure the adapter could be smaller."
4,TRENTnet TU2-ET100 adapter saved my computer,"After reading a reviews on this product from someone how had the same problem, the ethernet card cooked by lightning. I desided to purchase one from Amazon. It worked great. After configuring the new adapter."
1,Did not Work With HP Envy,"Bought it to replace lost HP Envy 'dongle' RJ to USB plug. Did not work. Had to go back to HP at a ""price""."
5,Great for Tivo,Used with older Tivo (Series 2) and it works great. Just plugged it in and that was all I needed to do. Was up and running within seconds. It has been working for more than 6 months without a hiccup.
5,Ideal for Tivo if you have a wired network available,"I bought this based on the positive reviews here regarding the use with a Tivo Series 2. They are right.I plugged my ethernet cable into the one end and then navigated on my Tivo to the ""Phone & Network"" setup page. Changed to ""Use the Network"" and plugged the USB end into my Tivo. In just a few seconds it was recognized and assigned an IP address. Easier than I expected.For the price, I expected this to be clunky or feel cheaply made. Neither is the case. I'm quite happy."
3,Trendnet USB 10-100 Mbps Adapter,I didn't expect much when I ordered this item. I was hoping for a reasonable amount of function and be satisfied with that. I was surprised to see it functions well on any laptop or computer that I own. I would recommend this as a cost effective way to connect to your network.
2,Worked great and then quit!,"I have purchased two of these, one for an office computer and another for an older laptop, both of which had lost their onboard ethernet. They worked great, but both have quit in less than a year. I am trying another brand next time."
5,Corruption and search for a true identity,"I must confess I bought this book because I truly enjoyed Latin Moon over Manhattan and I wasn't dissapointed. In the book Manrique leads us through a tumultuos Spain visit, a journey back to Colombia and the adventures of the main character. Manrique has a very good sense of humor and although he shows how corruption and power have spoiled some of his characters, he still brings out the warmth of the more real people that were a part of his childhood, giving us a clear glimpse at a life in Colombia that will not last forever. A very good book."
5,Excellent new band,"I have been a fan of Relient K for a a while now, and when I saw this CD in the store I decided I'd try it out. Now I'm hooked! I love their music, and the positive message is few and far between nowadays (even in Christian music). Can't wait for another album from this great group!"
4,A Potpourri of all the best!,"This book is a great mixture of all the best literature of the modernist latinas. If you want a great poem, this is where to look!"
3,good book but inaccurate description,"the book Oggi In Italia was what I was looking for but the description was inaccurate. The book has not only writing and notes on almost every page, it is profane writing and this is a student's book. At least the book is in good binding condition."
2,Could have been better - Please read this for your own sake!,"I, like most of you, read the description and some of the reviews and said, ""I have to check this out!"" Well, I did check it out and was very disappointed. Although it isn't 'bad' it isn't good either. I'll do this in convenient list form.1. It was way too long. It had no reason to be so long.2. Certain characters were pointless to the story.3. Annoying dialogue. Why did I hate the characters I was supposed to like, and like the characters I was supposed to hate?4. Boring. It tried to be a nonstop action fest, but all it did was confuse me on locations and characters.The only good thing is the message of the book, I guess. You get this towards the last 1\4th of the book. Even the end was far too long. I am not a person who dislikes long books, I don't care how long a book is if it's entertaining and tells a good story, but this just didn't do it. Be cautious if you buy this."
2,very bad batteries and poor customer support,"I bought this combo pack several months ago and am very disappointed with the poor quality batteries. Also, I have had no luck trying to replace the bulb on the light.When I called customer support to report that my batteries were not holding a charge, I got the run around. No help whatsoever.While I've been happy with other corded Milwuakee tools I've owned, these cordless tools are worthless without a good battery. DO NOT BUY MILWUAKEE CORDLESS."
3,Broken flashlight,"The tools are good. Rugged, decent battery life (though both saws chew through battery very quick). The flashlight came dead on arrival though, very disappointing."
4,Happy BUT not impressed,"My older Dewault 18v cordless (nicad battery - older style battery) is just as strong as this Milwaukee lithium and seems to last MUCH longer. Perhaps the Dewault drill is just better. One of the lithium batteries of this Milwaukee has already died completely (3 months after purchase). Two batteries are a must because I am constantly needing to recharge, particularly when using the circular saw. The circular saw has plenty of power to cut, but does not last much longer than say cutting through 60' of 1"" plank. Perhaps the seller lied about this product not being refurbished and that is why my batteries suck. One more negative comment is that the cordless drill is much bigger than my Dewault, making it more awkard, heavier and harder to use in tight spaces. However, I love the overall design, feel, and performance of the Milwaukee tools and I am betting on general better quality of the name. Again, two batteries are a must with these cordless tools."
3,Buyers Beware,"I recently ordered this ""Complete Collection"" to only be disappointed, not with Love Hina the series, but with this product itself. Anime Legends' Love Hina Complete Collection is far from being complete. This title only has 24 of the episodes. What about the 25th episode and the movies? You wont find them here. Love Hina is a great series, and a lot of reviews written on this product will tell you that. I am writing this because I want people to know about the product itself because most people only write about the series. Had I known this, I would have ordered the Love Hina Perfect Collection. 24 episodes, thats it. No more, no less."
3,Not the Manga,"I was disappointed with the DVD set. I had read the entire manga series before purchasing and I wanted to see how well they did. If you're familiar with FruBa, you know how true-to-the-manga the show was. It's just not so with Love Hina. I was disappointed with the dubbing, disappointed with the way some things happened. I wound up not even watching the whole series.The DVD is good quality and I still love some of the characters, but I wouldn't recommend this DVD set to anyone who loved the manga and doesn't want to see it changed."
5,Love Hina - A Great Anime Series,"It all starts when Keitaro Urashima's grandmother (who is a manager for a women's apartment building) decides to go off and see the world. Keitaro becomes manager and that's where it all starts...and boy, it gets good after that...A great story which ends the series by the three movies (Christmas, Spring and Love Hina Again). The Christmas movie contains the hidden 25th episode which is great.If you're like me and are into Anime big time, a great series for you to check out!"
3,Great for a 50's costume,"The costume was a really cute costume, but the sizing was off. The shirt was very small for the size stated (and my daughter is very slender). The skirt was way too big, but using a safety pin was okay because of the way it was made. It looked adorable on. Thank goodness I read the reviews before ordering or I would've ordered a smaller size, and the shirt definitely wouldn't have fit."
3,Very cute,"Cute product. Very itchy arm bands, my daughter said. And the shirt was super tight, while I had to safety pin the skirt in the back to make it stay up on her. Almost seemed like two different sizes. She won't be able to use the shirt ever again, but the skirt should last a couple of years. The quality of the skirt was very good (and adorable!). Just the shirt didn't seem that great..."
4,Very pleased!,"I ordered this for my daugthers upcoming Father/Daughter sock hop dance and was very pleased with it all around. I am hestiant to order things like this online becuase I have found that many times the quality of the product is not nearly as good as it is shown in the photo. This was a whole different experience. I found the skirt to be nice quality, no tatters, no strings hanging and the poodle and sequins were well adhered to the skirt. My daughter is extremely petite and I ordered a size xtra small. The shirt is a perfect fit and the skirt was a tiny bit too big in the waist, but I attribute that more to her being smaller than the average size 4-6. The shirts sequined collar and sleeves are well sewn and really added a little extra something! I think the scarf is probably better used and a neck scarf and not a head scarf due to the length. Overall, I am very pleased with the outfit and would recommend it."
4,Decent Product,"Software a little confusing, but that is typical. Overall, for the money. good product. The only thing I have a progblem with Amazon not sending me an order confirmation, which caused me to have to cancel a credit card after I saw they had billed my account. I don't go for that!!!"
3,ok,unit arrived inoperable. sent it back to manufacture. just returned today. haven't had achance to try it.
1,"low quality, no support, not recommended",I've had this unit for about 1.5 years. The computer I/F worked for the first month and then quit. The wireless I/F works ok ( I'm running it about 75' ) but the update rate is too slow to support recording any wind gusts. Rain gauge doesn't record properly. Support never returned calls or e-mails so I'm stuck with a broken unit. Not recommended.
1,Avoid this product,"LaCrosse technical support is abysmal. 9 times out of 10 when you call you will have to leave a voice mail. These units ship with cheap telephone cable that easily pick up interference. You can use the wireless mode to help combat this, but you will only get updates once every 2 minutes. For wind information (gusts) this is unacceptable. Just be warned, you get what you pay for."
4,It is hard to believe...,"I pondered this purchase for quite some time. It seemed to offer the same features as the $500+ Davis and Peet Bros. stations for a whole bunch less and even included the software for free. Finally bought it and am quite pleased. My ham transmitter may screw up the rain gauge ""inches in the last hour"" recording, but I am not even sure about that.I sure cannot see anything the expensive stations have that this one doesn't have except for its ""non-hackability"". As a gadget geek, I'd like to know more about the interfaces and the software construction."
5,great videio,"This video is an awesome workout, though it does take a good chunk of time (approx. 90 mins).It got me in INCREDIBLE shape! If you have knee issues, you may need to skip a couple of the exercises like I do, as they are too hard on my bad knees. VERY happy with this video!"
3,Debbie Siebers' Tear It Up!,"This is not a work out you want to do if you are a beginner, I would say start with her Slim in 6 series first, then move onto this workout. You will be dripping with sweat, burning fat, and toning all at the same time. Arms to calves will be slimmer, trimmer and tones with this workout, and the cooldown period is great. I would recommend this workout DVD for those who need intense training, have been working out for a while and are looking for a challenge, or for those who need to mix up their regular workout routine."
3,Good workout but a bit boring...,"It is a total body workout but I found it to be too long with nothing fun to keep you going for that long. No fun motivating music, she gives you great cues and is easy to follow but she doesn't have a perky personality. It's a great total body workout, the exercises are good but it lacks energy. I will keep it but it's not one that I would be excited to do."
5,A Great Read,"Its remarkable that this information isnt more widely known or reported. WMD's were in Iraq and Saddam planned to use them on Israel and Saudi Arabia. The author is a little repetitive in some places, but this is fascinating information which should exonerate President Bush from taunts that :there were no WMD's""."
5,At last. The truth we all hoped for.,"An amazing true story from someone who lived it and knows first-hand. A fascinating perspective in its own rite, this book should shake up the naysayers...and validate those committed to the process in Iraq. This message needs to get out!!!!"
4,Saddam's secrets,Saddam's SecretsThe five copies I ordered arrived promptly and in excellent condition. A very reasonable price.
3,A nice history lesson of Iraq.,"A nice read, but General Sada repeats himself over and over throughout the book and sometimes spends way too much time on one subject. The book is more about General Sada's life then about Saddam's Secrets. He really didn't provide any secrets we didn't already know. His book should be read by every Iraqi so that they could understand where the country needs to go to make it a better place. He has vision, but even with his plan, the religions in that area, as well as the large amount of corruption will prevent it from happening. It was interesting, but he provides very little evidence to back up what he says."
1,An amateur writer,"I have almost finished the book and find it to be written in a very amateurish style that you might find from a teenager, not a general.I am enjoying the book but don't put too much credence on his version of the truth. I am not a Saddam Hussein supporter but find the book unconvincing about 'the other side view'.If this was promoted by the CIA of GW Bush to justify taking USA to war, I would remain unconvinced by this man's account."
2,Second or Third Hand guesswork,"I am disappointed with this book. The tittle of this book is Saddam's Scerets. Whatever ""secrets"" the book has brought to light is second or third hand guesswork of the author with very little specific details. Author had limited first person encounters with Saddam. A lot of the book has nothing to do with Saddam's secrets."
1,Most are missing the obvious,"So far, other reviewers, including those who see through Sada's sham, seem to be missing the salient point. When I saw the interview on the Daly Show, I immediately thought, why isn't Fox News and, more importantly, the Bush administration all over this? His claim that WMD existed and were hidden in Syria is major news. Do you really think that Sada, who claims to be a top official in the new Iraqi government, would sit on information like this for three years waiting to reveal it in a book? Don't you think he would have long since revealed it to the Iraqi and U.S. governments. If there were anything to this, it would be all Bush would be talking about instead of blaming the lack of WMD on faulty intelligent. The fact that Fox and Bush are silent on it should be your first clues as to Sada's credibility. Come on people, think!"
1,"Sorry, Latest Documents Again Reveal, Iraq Had No Weapons","Three years in, and we're still trying to re-write why we are there. It's a bit too late now. Let's get back to reality shall we, and look at the facts."
1,wish i had...,I wish that I had read this more closely and had NOT purchased this late at nite either....It is NOt Shania Twain...I would like to send it back but can not do so...so...
3,Isn't it odd?,"I found this book doing a check of my own last name, so I got it; no relation to the authors. However, I did once have an Aunt, Doris, who like to write after getting a second bottle of bourbon down her gullet. That's what this book reminds me of. Good job, boys."
2,Completely repetitive,This book has about ten ideas and keeps repeating them over and over under different headings. What a waste.
5,Michael McCormack stupid and lazy.,"Michael McCormack, Your review of this book shows your ignorance. You state the author needs more research yet you admit you did not even read the entire book! This review shows you are both stupid and lazy. I found it had impressive coverage for a book this size. You should stick to watching those Buffy The Vampire Slayer reruns You love so much. That is obviously your intellectual level!"
4,"Great value, easy to use","I bought this pedal to replace a balky chorus unit. It was $10 more than the Boss Chorus I was looking at.I bought it fully prepared to return it if it was not easy to use. I was put off by the very small print listing amp and effects settings on the unit itself. I spent about 30 minutes looking at on-line instuctional videos on [...] and [...] and I have found it very easy to use and tweak.PROS: price, expression pedal, usb port, tweaking software. Great clean effects sounds...revert, delay, chorus, etc. I don't use distortion much so I can't comment on that. Expression pedal is great because it permits easy access to volume tweaking (e.g. rythm vs. lead).CONS: As stated by numerous reviewers it can be difficult to get into bypass mode (you have to press both foot switches simultaneously) which limits the pedals usefulness in live performance. It is heavy and big to lug around (partly due to expression pedal) and has no battery power option."
1,DigiTech RP250 bad buy,"DO NOT purchase the DigiTech rp250 thinking that this will be a great multi-effect pedal. After being turned on the pedal was frozen on UPLOAD, tried dealing with the DigiTech company and was told to upload patches, did this and still no luck. So I called the tech support hoping to figure out what was wrong and I was told to return it to where I bought it. Digitech will not honor their warranty, poor technical support that did not want to spend anytime trying to help customers, overall poor product and even worse service."
2,"Not the best of quality, construction or tone","I had problems with this device day 1, I gave it a few weeks, and finally gave up on it, and sold it someone on ebay.Yes, they give you every effect and option under the sun, but for the most part they are low-quality effects and models. You certainly get what you pay for in these all in one multi-effect units.The construction is low-quality as well. The knobs started falling off on me after a week.If you must get a multi-effect pedal you are going to have to spend a lot more money and get a Line6 POD live if you want some quality."
2,Confusing,"I bought this book for 1 cent, which I thought was a bargain. Its not. The prose is interesting and so is the concept but these poor innocent amazon indians are now confronted with a book they cannot read about a religion which conflicts with all their prior notions. This is an example of how not to do missionary work. The book is very much in need of editing and the Waltons ( their real name??)well meaning though they may be will forever be regarded by these wonderful aborigines as the ""comatzua nipotuta buana."""
1,Worthless,I thought maybe they had come up with a way for socks to stay up and not have the elastic give out over time. Nope. These never stay up to begin with! I wore them once then tossed them.
2,Title somewhat misleading,"Inspired by all the 5-stars rating this book got , I had quite high expectations. I was looking forward to find a few original ideas about the very demanding subject of ""Spontaneity"" as a human source of inspiration, play and selffullfilment.If you approach this book from this angle, you probably are going to be disappointed.""Ritual and Spontaneity ..."" happens to be just the title of one of 10 chapters of the book. The chapters contain detailed analysis of concrete moments of the psychoanalytic process and the psychiatrist's possiblity to step out of orthodox rules of neutrality.If that special case of spontaneity is all you are interested in, this book should be enjoyable."
4,Great value for money!,"Really glad I bought these. They sound great, and look cool too. Battery life seems good as I must have been playing them with the same ones for over ten hours now. They're not showing any signs of running out yet!They seem to fill the room with sound. Not earth shattering bass, but good and warm. Vocals are clear, clean and crisp and they go pretty loud too.The way they fold together like a double CD case means they're dead easy to take around with you + the colours are so vivid they're a definate conversation piece as another reviewer has said!If you want portable audio, a good buy...!"
2,Cheap and flimsy,"When I first got these speakers they seemed flimsy and cheap, but since they weren't that expensive, I decided to try them out. First of all I had trouble getting the batteries that are included with the speakers in (I also later discovered that regular AA batteries don't fit, you have to get ones that are shorter just for the speakers). The sound is OK, nothing marvelous but fair enough for the price.Then about 20 days after I got them, after I had only used them maybe 4 times, when I turned them on they produced hardly any sound at all. There is no volume adjustment on the speakers which was annoying as I had my CD player volume all the way up, which coming out of anything other than these speakers would be way too loud.Maybe my speakers were defective but I wasn't happy enough with them to get a replacement, I'm spending my money on something else."
2,Horrible sound for the price; bad interior design,"I am really not impressed with this product, esp. when you factor in the price. The sound is highly distorted at high volume and at regular volume, it sounds like my old transistor radio. I get better sound out of my [cheaper] speakers.As another reviewer mentioned, parts of the interior are exposed, which doesn't make much sense, and the batteries are very tricky to get in (and shouldn't battery insertion be a no-brainer??) The batteries are also very susceptible to being knocked around, they do not sit securely in their sockets.Overall, considering this system is 2 to 3 times what I would have paid for other speakers, I'm returning these."
1,Horrible Sound - No volume control,"I've been looking for a set of battery powered portable speakers for some time now. Unfortunately I wasted my money on these. I can't even listen to these without all the crackling and noise constantly annoying me. My crappy laptop speaker sounds better! If you want these, you can have mine."
1,Piece of Crap,"Worthless sound, weak and distorted. I waited 2 months for these with great anticipation but I am sorry now. I recomend you look elsewhere. Oh yea, they are bigger than I thought they would be as well."
3,Short but helpful guide,"I bought this book as a gift but learned alot from it myself. I found it quite helpful.Some things in the book were hard to find, such as the explanation of different zone defenses for NCAA. Once found, I did learn something! The explanations were short and to-the-point.There were some pictures and diagrams, but mostly the book is text. I was hoping for more pictures.The book covers both NBA and NCAA basketball.Overall, not a bad place to get started with basketball!"
1,Basketball book.,I don't really hate this book because I never purchased it. Don't know why this is on my list of purchases. I never would have purchased this book because I don't like sports.
3,Too Large,We were looking for a reliable weather station and picked this because of the price. Purchased on sale for less than $20 this was worth the money. I would not pay the original price for this. It is plastic and VERY LARGE. It has it's place in the back entry way but would not be decorative in view of your guests.
1,NOT accurate at all!! Spend more and get a good one!,"This weather station is a waste of money! It is never the same as far as accuracy. There are times it is 10 degrees off and times it is 100 degrees off..NO that was NO typo...it said it was 167 degrees the other day outside. We are in the middle of a blizzard and have not reached temps over 50 degrees this past month in in Colorado. I am going to call the company and see about sending it back. I have reset it over and over, relocated it twice..sorry to say it is junk!I bought it because it was a bargain..wished I would've paid more and got one that works!"
4,Great for the Price,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas... we are all interested in weather and this gives us what we need/want to know... I like the large print for all the information, and there is so much information on this unit that it takes me a while to figure out which section has what I want to know. That's a good thing though, I suspect more expensive units might be easier to read but I can't imagine that most people need anything more extensive than this."
5,Excellent deal,"This is the 1st HD TV that I have owned, but I did a lot of research on which one to buy. For the price, this one is a steal. It picks up the broadcast HD chanels over an antenna and they look better than cable on my cousins flat screen LCD. I had a section of burnt out pixels on my original TV, and Sony support was great. They sent a replacement and packed out the old one. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,optical block on all these tv's will go out.,Please be warned - all rear projection tv's by sony will cost you 1.2k to replace this part. They will not fix it.
1,Optical block problem,"Unfortunately after owning this set for 18 months, it has developed a blue haze in the upper right and upper left corners of the screen. It seems that this issue has appeared in several Sony rear proj. LCD models including this one. It's very expensive to repair and seems to stem from dust infiltration which is inevitable. The cost of repair exceeds half of the origainal purchase price. Lamps are expensive as well. Perhaps a full LCD set would be a better choice (i.e. Sharp or Vizio) with no moving parts."
1,18 months old and it's gonna cost a fortune to fix,"we bought this Sony in July of 06 and now (Jan-08) we have ghosting color bands at the top of the screen that have doubled in size in less than a month. the closest Sony tech is 70+ miles away and I have to haul it up there, pay him $225 and pray it's the Optical Block that's the issue which should still be under warranty (we hope). This is the second Sony projection TV that has died in under 5 years. Shame on me for getting this one. Guess Bush's 'stimulus' will be going to a new TV! don't get one, you'll end up paying for it. just google 'Sony optical block' and you'll see what I'm talking about."
2,A Change for the worse,"Wow, to understand where Brandtson is going, review Silverchair's career. I bought this yesterday, put it in the CD player with some other Brandtson fans around, and as the CD played we all looked at each other and scratched out heads. I said, ""Maybe it will grow on us."" But, no. I've listened to ""Hello Control"" five times now, and while it's catchy, it's also annoying and corny with no edge whatsoever. Pass on this one."
1,Ripped Off,"When I received the item, there were only 2 CDs in the Box Set -- Disk 3 was not included. Further, I was charged the list price of $18.98. So I feel like I was ripped off by Amazon."
2,Amazon needs to fix how this downloads,It downloads all screwed up on the MP3 side... it mixes all the 1's 2's 3's etc... all together then you have to manually fix them back up in the correct order based on name and renumber them all. Kinda sucks.
2,KingKrazy,"Quality is OK. But signage sucks.,Could be much better if it was hand signed as most lithographaths are. Looks cheep..."
4,Perfect for my needs,It worked for what I needed it for at work! It isn't top of the line but does do the trick! Cuts through a slew of materials quite well. No real complaints!
4,Easy to use,"This product may not be the top of the line pipe cutter, but it does a great job for what I have used it for. It makes quick work of cutting through 160psi PVC tubing. No muscles required :o)"
5,Just what I needed,This pipe cutter is made so that you can slowly work your tool into your pipe without finding pieces everywhere.
4,works well for small jobs,"i didn't have any issues with the function of these. They take a lot of force to get them to cut through 1"" PVC so I recommend wearing gloves for a little cushion. As others have noted, it's pretty much impossible to get a perfectly straight cut - the blade has just enough wobble that it always cuts at an angle and the curved arm always holds the PVC straight. But they worked great for the 25 or so cuts I had to make and it felt like it was in the same condition after the job as when I first received the cutter - ie the cutter doesn't feel like it will wear out or break anytime soon."
3,Not bad.,For the price and occasional use it is a handy little tool to have. It is not made well enough to stand up to heavy use but for the occasional need to cut some PVC it works well.
1,Herbology?,"The book covers in its supplement section a great number of herbs. It undertakes to provide the history of the herbs to include, but not limited to, historical occult practice application (i.e., Sage, St. John's Wort) of some of the herbs. The coverage of the supplemental herb segments is too generic rendering the information of limited practical value. The book's herb toxicological approach is very limited and a much better (albeit less expensive) text dedicated to herb information is to be found in the PDR specialty textbook on herbs. In addition, the textbook's approach to vitamins and minerals is found to be deficient falling far behind the available PDR textbook on vitamins, minerals, and supplements."
3,Where the Clouds Meet the Water,"The subject matter of this book is very informative and enlightening. Learning about the fact the the United States ""asked"" Latin American countries to round-up and deport their own citizens of German, Italian and Japanese descent is scary and it brings forward the ugly side of human nature when war is in the horizon. I find the research on names and places a bit on the weak side. In addition, I think it would have been very beneficial to have a good editor."
4,Lots of Good Bits,I have been looking for a book to help me rethink the way I work and this one was recommended by a friend. I bought it and enjoyed especially several of the essays- the one on how movie makers work and think was really good.Overall this is full of good examples of existing practice. But you need to work with the case studies to see how they might apply.
4,"Useful Perspectives (60-second book review by jurgen wolff, author of ""Focus: use the power of targeted thinking"")","Length:: 1:10 MinsSixty-second (more or less) review of ""Breakthrough Thinking"" from Jurgen Wolff, author of ""Focus: Use the power of targeted thinking to get more done""Focus: Use the Power of Targeted Thinking to Get More Done"
3,Xylichew Peppermint Gum,Have had this gum from other sources and always liked it. This particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before...could be it is older gum(there is no expiration date on it) or they are making it with less peppermint now. Otherwise I received this order very quickly.
2,Save your money!,"I bought this birdbath because I liked the idea of constantly moving water in my birdbath, but I had to send the solar piece back once, as it was leaking water into the panel. The pump part is very fragile and cheaply made and broke within 6 months of owning it. I ended up throwing out the solar piece and leaving the resin insert in the bottom(in the winter, you can't use the solar panel when the temperature is below freezing)year round, to use as a regular bird bath. Whatever the inside of the bath was coated with, degraded and was floating in the water every time I cleaned it out, even though I followed manufacturer's guidelines for cleaning. Customer service for the company is pretty much useless and it was difficult to get a hold of a live person. Very disappointing!"
2,very cheap,"I second Dianna's opinion. I purchased this product because I liked the idea of solar powered rather than electric pump. The pump was very fragile and it did not work properly from the very beginning (sometimes it did and sometimes it did not). Then the solar panel suddenly cracked. I contacted the manufacturer, but did not hear from them for the longest time (several months). By the time they got back to me and apologized for not contacting me right away (because their web site was under construction!!!), the basin got cracked as well and started leaking water. That was the last straw and rather than dealing with it any longer, I just threw the whole thing out. To their credit, it's a good concept, but a very poor execution."
5,Great Item,I have had this bird bath for 1 year now and I love it. It was easy to assemble and has been working very well. Also had good experience with customer service. The pedestal was cracked and they sent a new one very quickly.
2,Didn't Last,"Save your money. Water beads well for about two weeks, then it's as if you applied nothing. Silicon is probably just as good, and a lot cheaper!"
4,"easy to use, good results","Great product, but only enough to do a small top thoroughly.Cleaned the top with the raggtopp cleaner first (easy to use, great product), then applied the two coats as directed. The top looked brand new and I was really amazed at the difference. I have a small convertible top (pontiac solstice), and unfortunately there was not enough product left to do another solstice top. If you have a larger top you'll need to get two bottles to do a thorough job."
4,ragg topp fabric protectant,"first can arrived with no air in can, company sent a new can very quickly. second can worked great for the first coat but 20 minutes later when I tried to apply the second coat the can would no longer spray it came out as a stream. hopeing the first coat was enough. Fabric looks good afterword and it appears to repel water. I would rate it five star if the cans worked right."
5,Best. Convertible. Treatment,"Raggtopp is the best fabric convertible top care product I have used. The protectant causes the water to bead up and not soak into the fabric. It keeps the top looking like new. Seriously, get this product and use it."
5,Best of the Three,"I think this first one, Tiamat book that is, is the best of the three [trilogy]. Or at least I like it better. Althoguh each one takes you into other parts of the 6th Century world, and the third is written for a younger person than I, or so I feel. It makes me feel eveything is ok, you know, worthwhile."
5,You tell 'em!,"Witty, perceptive, humorous, serious...quotes from some of the greatest women in history on every topic imaginable. A great value, both content and price-wise. Don't miss it!"
2,superman costume,"The costume is very cute, but the velcro squares for the cape just fell off as though they were not even sewn on. That was disappointing especially because we took Jacob to Boo at the Zoo for his first wearing and the cape fell off. Not crazy about the velcro around the legs either but they stayed put. Otherwise the costume is cute."
3,For a quick fun,great costume for my 6 mth old baby. a bit too big for him and not as comfortable or warm for outdoor use but good to see him in this costume. his first halloween costume that his mom wanted.
2,"Welp, I found a clip over at Tower Records","I mean i guess i give it 2 Stars, honestly next to Herbert Kagel's superb casting and conducting on Berlin Classics, this 1968/Bohm should get only 1 Star/Bohm was a master in mnay styles, I;m afraid here its a dud.You can also see my comments on Bohm's 1971 recording/Opera D Or.There also I give it a dud rating/1 Star.."
4,All the basics of lighting &most of the tips known to date,"An interesting book.Covers every aspect of 3D lighting, how to position lights, adjust colors and power, shadows, compositing and materials...It's actually the opposite of Foley&Van Dam ""Introduction to Computer graphics"" : not much theory, a lot of handy stuff. Perfect (really) for beginners or wannabe 3D artists, it may be a bit disappointing for professionals, because they already know all the information contained. A bit disappointing, but still a nice reference book to have, and it may prove helpful when you've been working overnight on this shot due yesterday, and so tired that you just can't get the good atmosphere. Otherwise, colors are a bit pale to my taste, but nice illustrations all through the book. Delivered in 2 plain days from the US to Paris, France. Good job, Amazon, DHL, and Jeremy !"
2,Too basic,"Too much information in this book can be found in countless books on 3d, image manipulation and cinematography. Anyone who is serious about 3d will already know what a specularity map or find that information elsewhere (just read the manual that came with the software) - and do we really need another book explaining the difference between a medium shot and a close up. There's not enough truly indepth and 3d specific stuff that cant befound anywhere else. For example, Birn spends about two pages explaining how to fake global illumination through setting up extra lights that simulate the effect of lights bounced off surfaces. That alone should have been a whole chapter. How come all books on 3d are either really basic stuff that most people with some professional experiense will already know, or very indepth technical stuff for programmers only. I have yet to find one truly useful book on 3d that I can actually learn a significant amount of new stuff from."
5,"Excellent information, beautifully presented","This is a terrific book. The author takes on digital image-making as a combination of computer technique and traditional, professional art, photography, and film. This is an enlightened viewpoint, and allows the author to talk about many important technical details while keeping in mind their service to the aesthetics of the result.The book considers traditional topics like cinematography, lighting, and composition simultaneously with computer graphics topics like motion blur, negative lights, and multi-pass rendering. The result is a synthetic, unified presentation. The material is all solid and reliable, from the traditions of lighting to the mechanics of rendering.The book is beautifully executed. The writing is superb, the flow of information is clean, and the figures are frequent and terrific. Everyone who creates images with a computer should know this information, and this book is an ideal way to get it. Highly recommended."
5,Things you never thought of!,"This is an excellent comprehensive books that will, if you follow it's advice, give your work more depth, atmosphere, beleivability. I found Lighting and Rendering easy to read and it is written in plain english, with all the technical data spelled out, so there was no guessing. It is a must have for any illustrator or 3D animator."
2,Disappointing,I've had an infrared thermometer for years and have enjoyed it's ease of use and accuracy. When someone on my Christmas List asked for one I thought it would be a great gift. I was sorely disappointed with my selection in this one. Look for something better.
3,b-5,"promptly received. packaged fine. been taking it, but no idea if it is working or helps. still, no negative aspects to report either."
1,Maybe it's time for a classic text to update itself?,"If you never know physics before and are the type of person who learns better through the excitement and fascination of the subject's beauty. You probably won't find this book as a good starter. This classic book is written in the tradition text book style. The book just literally tells you what is what in a few sentences and that is all. No further easy explanations, simple analogies, fun food for thoughts, misunderstanding or concept trap warnings, chapter motivations, or anything to help you enjoy while learning. Maybe it's time for this classic text to update itself a bit?"
2,missed alot,"JUST QUICKLY SKIMMED THROUGH YOUR BOOK.THIS IS GOOD FOR THE BEGINER, BUT I CAN NAME AT LEAST A DOZEN HIGH ENERGY TOP OF THE LINE PLACES TO WORK-OUT WHILE TRAVELING.I CAN DO THAT IN ABOUT THREE MORE CITIES.I THINK THIS IS GOOD FOR TRAVELERS IN THEIR OWN HOTEL.PERIOD.MY WIFE COMPETES IN TRI'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I AM THE VACATION PLANNER.WE BOTH LIKE TO HAVE UPDATED EQUIPMENT WHEN WE TRAVEL, SO I MAKE IT A POINT TO INVESTIGATE THE AREAS.NICE ATTEMPT, BUT THEY MISSED MANY GREAT PLACES.AL"
5,So fun,Takes me back to the fun New Wave days of the 80s. I remember the fun of that decade. Psychedelic Furs were always a fav of mine!
1,Maybe the songs that sold the most...,"...but not the best songs.If you're looking for a great Furs CD, don't waste your $$$ on anything that doesn't have ""Get a Room"". That song is not just one of their best, it is one of the best songs of that genre."
4,fine collection of essentials...all you need,"This is a all your really need of the Furs/Butler. The albums are padded with strained filler, but Butler was too vain to ever admit he was really a pop single scribe (he should have taken a page from Nike Lowe's book, look who is rich now?).Best tunes are: Pretty in Pink, Love My Way, The Ghost in You, Until She Comes.A great value."
3,Cobraken,"The CD was ok, seems like it only had 1 hit song on it. The rest were songs I had never heard. Oh well."
3,Aloha Forever,"Mrs. Gunn knows how to write a story and give a satisfactory ending.I enjoyed the messages of this book:forgivingness,praying for your enemies, trusting who you love(hint hint),making decisions, humility.Christy gets invited on the trip of a lifetime. Hawaii. Her ol bff Paula is coming an so is hr family sans her dad and Todd. but Paula seems like she wants Todd and to be ""reckless"" which makes the friendship strained.I like how learning to drive was incorporated into this book...it's the first time I read anything like this in YA. I also loved the refreshing bittersweet ending full of twists and turns.I didn't like some of the risky behavior that was included in the adventure. I also don't really like the main characters...they (especially Christy) are a bit silly and immature (to me they are not people I wish were real and they don't seem that real)which amplifies the morals of the stories...so in a way it is a good thing."
5,BEST BOOKS EVER!!,"I am a hopeless romantic when it comes to books, even though I am 15, so these are perfect. This is probably the best out of the sereies. I am a Todd fan so I enjoyed him being in this book the whole way through. Paula did get on my nerves by always trying to steel Todd away from Christy and copying ever thing Christy did, but it all turned out fine. I recomend this bood for sure! Its great. I think this book deserves 5+ stars... well maybe Im excaturating a little... but I still love it."
1,not my cup of tea,"I read the excerpt in March Fortune. Just that was enough to make my decision.While some may like his style, I find it tiresome and not one that I want to spend much time with,"
4,History as comedy as business lesson,"There are many books on the Roman Empire, but this is the first to treat it as a business enterprise. This short book chronicles the birth of Rome, from its mythical origins in the Aeneid, to its rise as a city state, growth into a Republic, transformation into Empire, its adoption of Christianity, split into East and West, and the West's metamorphosis into the Catholic Church. The book is broken into many small chapters, with each chapter focusing on a couple centuries of history, and the entire story laid out in chronological order. The primary emphasis is on Rome's early days and conquest of Carthage, and the days of Julius Caesar.There is enough history here for those not familiar with Roman history. For true history buffs, this book serves more as an editorial comedy, and less as a history lesson. The parallels with modern corporations are many, and quite insightful. Overall, a good book and easy to read."
4,Go Rome,"This book was so funny while being educative and historical all at the same time. If this guy is running a corporation, sign me up to work with him."
4,I liked It,"The Libertines cd's, I play them a lot. I enjoyed reading about the band. It is set up where the author presents what I assume are direct quotes from the bands members, and people close to the band, and then he writes his own conclusions.If you are a fan of the Libertines, or music in general, you might enjoy it. I recommend it if you like the libertines at least.Thanks for reading my review!"
2,Caution.,"To all of you looking for the original soundtrack of the anime series Diamond Day Dreams released by ADV Films this disk do not contain the music of the series episodes. Despite the fact that in the cover says ""original soundtrack is everything but that, it contains 62 tracks of good music but none of them played in series."
3,does the job,"Have two large dogs and exercise them at beach - sand and wet towels well contained and protects cargo area. It COULD fit a bit snugger, especially along tailgate edge where it tends to curl or lift - considering some velcro fix. All-in-all heavy duty and does the job"
4,What took me so long?,"I wished I had bought this years ago. I have a 2002 Jeep Liberty and this has made life so much easier. No more spilled potting soil to vacuum up or worried about tossing the wet, dirty stroller in the back. Great product - excellent fit!"
2,Huge disappointment,"The premise and the storyline of the game is standard, but the gameplay is annoying to no end. It is impossible to permanently take out any of your opponents. Whether it's a security guard or a surveillance camera, you can only temporarily knock it out. After a couple minutes they wake up and sound an alarm. Tell me, exactly how does a video camera magically fix itself after you zap it out of commission? This makes for extremely frustrating gameplay as you try to figure out what to do and where to go. The enemies always ""respawn"" but your ammo does not. I enjoy puzzles, but not when you're constantly being bothered by enemies you already took out. This pretty much ruined the entire game for me."
2,It stole minutes of my life,"Like all the other reviews said, this game is the worst covert game you can get. You can do everything that you can in the other games but who cares. Without a story to tie in all this sneaking it gets real monotonous. ""I'm a hot girl that steals things in competition with other burglars....that's it."" Other things are frustration in this game like not being able to kill people, which is fine but when you knock them out they are down for literally 1 minute. By the time I look around to see what I can use those guys are getting up. Really uninspired."
5,Lark Rise to Candleford-Season 4,Excellent family series. I bought them all! Love the BBC family stories. I love the acting in this movie. Excellent cast.
4,Doesn't Disappoint,"My only negative comment is that it is only 6 episodes where other seasons are longer. But the story and the characters remain true. If you have seen the other seasons, do not hesitate to purchase this one."
5,best series ever,I have never in my life watched anything that has acting like this series. These actors truly seem like these people they are portraying. This is slow moving at first. You need to watch an entire episode and maybe the first two to really get it. Then you are hooked. You learn more and more about them as time goes on. I have all four series and the only thing I dislike is that there are no more!
2,Candleford series 4: short and not complete,"I was disappointed in the 4th series of Candleford. It has two DVD instead of four. It is like they ended the series abruptly without much notice. We are left to assume that Laura marries the journalist. Laura's father is gone the whole time, however, it is only briefly explained why he had to leave. The relationship of Dorcus is completed to a degree but no marriage ceremonies just promises.I assume the series was dropped very quickly half way through the fourth series. I feel like I got ripped off by paying almost the same price for the other series that were double the amount of episodes or more.Also, we could do without Queenie's fortune telling through out all four series. These are occult practices not Christian for sure!Disappointed!"
1,lark rise to candleford....4???,we recieved lark rise to candleford season 3 instead of 4...and the cover was cracked...how do we get the correct and ordered season 4. we love the series and want to have the one we havent seen as yet...please help.thank youjoshanna bush
1,Season 4 was a total loss,"I can see why there will be no season 5. Season 4 was a rush job, they tried to tie the ends all in one episode and it ruined the final season. Dorcas married the last man standing(he never smiles), Mini married Alfie after his mother returns from prison & has an overnight epiphany on how to be a good/reformed mom, Laura & Daniel discuss Laura's writing ability & not much else. And Twister wasn't even in the last episode, nor was Mr. Timmons who not was even in season 4. Guess he was too busy with Downton Abby. They might have just as well had stopped with season 3. I guess this is why they lowered the price. So very disappointed."
4,British nut.,"Series 4 was very good but not quite as thought provocing as series 1, 2, 3. There were also fewer episodes than the other 3 series. But, I just can't help ordering this series and love the characters. Still had to be part of my collection."
3,What about Season 4?,"I have been obsessed with the previous seasons of LRTC as they have so successfully presented the themes of change and community ethics at the turn of the nineteenth century. The fourth season has been a disappointment in the high standards that the other seasons set. Unlike those successful portrayals, this season tells the stories without the interconnectedness of the people of the two communities and the elemental layering of meaning. The folks who constructed the original series 1-3 were masterful in drawing the events and perceptions of the characters together to ""teach"" (what an outmoded notion)ethical lessons. In those plots the characters grew in their humanity. Season four was written as though it were fulfilling a contractual obligation. That said, the charm of the two communities still had greater appeal than 99.9% of what is fictionalized on American TV."
1,Buyer Beware: This Documentary is Amateurish,"Sadly, this documentary is making the rounds right now and is getting attention. It is poorly concieved and badly executed and in general, it's disappointing. As much as you respect the main character, the filmmaker relies too much on him and his co-horts and as a consequence this purported documentary on Luch Libre focuses on what should only be a footnote (the East L.A. Lucha scene) in the wider and more interesting story of the sport. Do yourself a favor and search out the more fascinating documentaries TALES FROM MEXICO OF WRESTLING, POLITICS AND RELIGION (UK 1990) or VIVIR EN LA LUCHA LIBRE (MEXICO 1998)."
4,Great Thriller,"This is the movie that started my Indian film addiction. When i bought this at a local store i had no idea what it was about but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies i had ever seen! The musical numbers are brilliant, and the DVD features an option to play them all in a row! Although this is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen, i must say there are times when i laughed out loud at the characteristic overacting of a horror film star. Also I was not used to the occasional switch between hindi (the primary language) and english phrases, so that provided more than a few laughs. The movie does run a little long at points and could have benefited from better editing, but overall it is worth the almost 3 hours it takes to watch, and you will find yourself humming the tunes long after its over."
3,A blast from the past.,"I saw this movie back when it was showing on the big screen (outdoors at a drive-in: for those of you under thirty years old, yes they really did exist!) I spent the whole time in stitches. This movie is a real hoot! Unfortunately the tape is of poor quality, although that is to be expected with a film of this type; yet it is certainly watchable. And still very funny. After seeing this movie you will never feel quite the same about dining out...or funeral homes...or, well, life in general. It's a slasher movie, but not your run of the mill type. Actually it's a ""cut"" above the rest (oh no, there goes my sharp wit again.) I won't spoil it by telling you anything about the plot. You'll have to watch it if you want to know."
3,the 1967 version was more to it than this one,"the 1967 version was much more gorier than this one , it showed the girl on the fence without boobs and that was for the breast of chicken, the leg of lamb well there was more to it than it is now , all in all the movie has left out a lot of parts since i saw it in 1967 myself.the movie now is just fast and dumb. i have it on vhs and dvd, and neither one of them are like it was in 1967,, but oh well if you want it in your collection i would advise to buy it , for a much cheaper price then most have of course,,good luck and enjoy,,,,,"
5,Cheesy never tasted so good,"I love this movie, it is one of those movies where everything is amataur,Obviously everyone involved with this movie had a great time making it and the low production value and high spirits make it a fun filed ride for me.I love it so much I am buying the DVD version despite have it on vhs for years. I love the casting in it and the idea of a ""motorcycle gang"" on Honda 50s or 90s barely more than a moped a hoot.Great movie with a cheeseberger and beer."
2,"Caution! Older USB 1-1 Spec, not USB 2.x.","I missed in the description that these hubs do not support the much-faster USB 2.0 spec, but are the older, slower and therefore less-desirable USB 1.1 compliant. This could have been emphasized more in the description to avoid misunderstanding."
2,Skip it,This is a pretty worthless 4 port hub considering it doesn't support USB 2.0. These are also subject to causing issues with key binds when you have a keyboard plugged into one. The port will not allow multiple keys to be used simultaneously which is highly frustrating.There are much better options available. Skip this one.
5,THE BLUE BOMBER IS BACK,This game is great. I got it when it first came out and played it for about 20 HOURS and still never beat it. This game is a great twist of the classic Mega Man X and X2. Buy it. You'll love it.
3,Fun but short,The game is fun but it is very short. If your good then you can beat it in about 1-2 hours
5,megamanX-trme,"This game is the best game ever it is awesome. You fight awesome bosses and enemies. The last boss is sigma. He has two modes the first is easy, you just stay in a corner and shoot him. The second one you just stand on his hand and shoot his head."
4,Corelle Melamine Tray - sized for one dinner,"We are thrilled with these trays, and are using them daily. They are all you would expect from Corelle, attractive and durable. I have washed them in the dishwasher with no problem. I highly recommend these."
3,Organ,"Golding's sophomore release for Palmetto sees him on his solid turf of organ trio hard-bop as ""Moonbird"". Sticking with his 2 man army of Bill Stewart on drums and Peter Bernstein on guitar, the trio belt out 50 mins. of soulful hard-bop. Definitiely one of the best organ-trios today! As before (the bop interpretation of Joni Mitchell's ""Woodstock"" on his previous album) Goldings often likes to throw in ""popular"" songs (in this case the Zombie's classic - ""Time of the season"") twist it and then jam on it. Larry's playing is ""hard"" yet soulful. On the whole, I felt the playing on this one was less ""open"" than the previous one......BUT his well estd. trademark of the guitar-organ conversations is well showcased here (Dig ""back in the day"") almost remenescing that 70s smoke filled club vibe of Wes and Jimmy Smith's jams!"
4,"quite lovely, actually",ambient. in the eno sense of the word.combines the melodic and atmospheric approach of brian eno and michael brook with the beats of photek and autecure.....the result is listening that is more 'easy' than 'uneasy'recommended
4,da bomb,"Dis record be da bomb diggity. Where ya't fellas? Minus the tracks where they let other people get their hands in the pot according to the credits, dis be some fine music. a dynamic duo, don't seek outside counsel fellas....keep doin whatcha doin."
1,Faulty Product,I had an electrician installing a piece of equipment that required installingf aa 60 amp breaker. When it came time to install the breaker I purchased from you. He tested it and immediately said this is a faulty breaker. I had to run out and purchase another breaker' It seems as everything I have purchased from Amazon was wrong in one way or another.
2,"Overrated, mannerist singer","Most of the tunes come from great films and / or the Great American Songbook. Andy's light hued voice is quite pleasant, but his terrible way with singing is not. Why does he have to put it on so? ""Michelle"" is plainly embarrassing, ""Bye Bye Blues"", an almost plaster cast from Bert Kaempfert's great recording, finds Williams swooping up the word ""blues"" for no apparent reason at all and so I could go on. I stopped buying Williams CDs after this one because of the irritating mannerisms that mar his singing to such an extent that most offerings become unlistenable. ""Yesterday"" is one fortunate exception, but not enough not to incur my wrath."
2,Skip This One,"Give this a pass and pick up Jennifer Warnes' Famous Blue Raincoat instead. One listen to Stevie Ray and Robben Ford on ""First We'll Take Manhattan"" and Warnes' exquisite rendition of the title song will make you forget this mish mash entirely."
1,What a shame!,"Every rendition on this CD except the last one is horrible. It is a huge mistake on anyone's part to attempt to give new interpretations to these songs, because without Cohen's deep voice and boundless spirituality, these songs would be just words+melodies instead of poetry. Rufus Wainwright's voice is particularly disturbing."
2,"fine songs, not-so-fine singers","This seems like the comic-book version of a classic. There is a handful of honest covers of Leonard Cohen's songs out there, but none of them is on this CD. If it's really necessary for you to hear an ""interpretation"" of the original reality, try Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah,"" Jennifer Warnes' ""Joan of Arc,"" or (yes!) Joe Cocker's ""Bird on a Wire."" With one or two exceptions--like the McGarrigles--the singers here are bland, tuneless hacks hitching a ride on songs they don't even understand."
5,The One Album Everyone Should Hear,"I am, but you don't have to be a Leonard Cohen fan to find ""I Am Your Man"" moving, soul touching, and inspirational. An ensemble of outstanding talents join together to pay tribute to Cohen's genius; in the process they create an album that ranks among the very best I've ever heard. The final track alone, with U2 backing Cohen, makes the album worth owning."
2,Key track missing,"Having watched the documentary, I purchased the CD. However the key track, 'Hallelujah' was not on it! I am very disappointed, as I regarded that as the peak of the experience."
4,"Movie in uneven, so is music","Just came home from seeing the movie. A little too long and some performances were painful (anthony for one) to watch. I agree with those who wish different performers had done the songs... tho I have always been a McGarrigle sisters fan.Strangely, Hallelujah is not on this cd, tho in the movie and one of the most moving performances I thought.. Wonder why it was omitted???Stiil over all, it is Leanard Cohen music and that is always special. I liked his closing number with U2 and I think he did too....The only drawback to the cd is that the film gives a context to nearly all songs and they flow out of a narrative. That won't be evident on the cd."
2,Listen to Cohen himself!,It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs. Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there? It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs. Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire! Please ...
3,The weakest of all his tribute albums,"Jennifer Warnes and Judy Collins should have been here to add a modicum of class to this project, but instead we are asked to endure C list musicians who cant carry a tune and are way out of their depth with Cohen's material. Left to their own devices they have recorded over an hours worth of criminal battery on Leonard Cohen songs... ""in beautys disguise."" as it were.Antony, U2, Perla Batalla and Teddy Thompson are the only artists that have coherent and vibrant contributions here.Beth Orton needs to be put out of her misery. Martha Wainwright needs to be let in on the secret that ""phrasing"" is used to convey emotion... Is she the one that encouraged Rufus to participate here?? He is amoung the rest that offer slices of fresh hell to this misguided attempt at a tribute.I missed the movie..I hope it came across better than this trainwreck of a record."
5,Leonard Cohen can do no wrong,He is an absolutely amazing poet/writer and performer. We have every LP / CD since he started and he has never let us down. I love LC
3,missing favorites.,"First let me start by saying that ""Leonard Cohn 'I'm Your Man' Is one of my all time favorit DVD's I receivd it as a gift and fell in love with it. I highly suggest you purchase it ....Now the sad part....Hallelujah, the traitor? I really expected these great songs to be on the soundrtack. I was so saddened to learn they were not on this product. I learned a valuable lesson. Always preview any purchases when buying music online. :("
3,I so wanted to love this cd...,"There are a few good songs here...No, there are a few really great covers of Leonard's masterpieces. Unfortunately there are several that left me just shaking my head and wondering why something better was not presented to showcase this genius of a song writer.Highlights:Antony's cover of ""If It Be Your Will"" (worth the price of the cd)ANTHEM sung by Batalla/Christensen is sublime.Also, the 2 songs by Thompson are quite good, especially ""The Future.""What was done to some of these pieces seemed tragic. ""Winter Lady"" is a lowlight, as is ""Famous Blue Raincoat.""This should have been so much better. Better song selections and certainly better renditions of Cohen's wonderful songs.There are some really great Cohen covers out there so I know it can be done. Better yet, listen to The Man himself. No one tops Leonard singing Leonard.I wish this was better, but do consider it for the Highlights. They are very good.Laurie"
5,Greatest lyrcist ever!,"Grabbed the DVD first of this tribute concert just because I liked Rufus Wainwright but wow was I in for a surprise. What a rare gem we have in Leonard Cohen and his incredible prose set to wonderful music. Whomever did the arrangements make all the songs sound as if they were just written. Only genius songs can posses this timelessness. Leonard Cohen's already powerful lyrics are further elevated by all the incredible artists that turned out to interpret some of his great works.The only flaw with this soundtrack is that it leaves out some of the songs in the DVD concert. And likewise there are gems on the soundtrack that were not on the DVD. Standouts are the showstopping ""If It Be Your Will"" by Antony, ""Bird On A Wire"", and ""Ring The Bells"". But the entire concert is a joy to discover if you aren't familiar with Mr. Cohen. Get the DVD first and use the sub titles to realize the full power of such magnificent lyrics (and music). it doesn't get any better than this!"
2,not very complete in identifying patterns,A collection of ads and drawings of silverplate patterns. I have 5 different patterns that we collect. This book only had 2 of the five.
1,Outdated & Overpriced,"Although this book sounded great, it was very disappointing...A very expensive book for the little knowledge in it...Lots of pages, but little information....Has many manufacturer's advertisement pictures and pages and pages of the same pattern, but not very helpful as far as identification!!! Very limited manufacturers and patterns...I wouldn't waste my time or money on purchasing this particular book, even for the novice it covers very little, unless you just like looking at pictures..."
3,It's pretty okay,"This book has lots of nice pictures and drawings that show good detail of the different patterns. There are lots of patterns to choose from including some that are very old. The only problem is that it doesn't really have a good variety of brands. Also, it took me a while to figure out where the values are. Once I figured that out, I got real tired of flipping back to the front cover over and over to see what my pieces were worth. However, if you've got the right brands this could be the perfect book for you!"
2,Head Band doesn't stay,1. The head sizes seem small. I didn't see any larger sizes than this and its a bit tight for me. So for people with larger heads-such as a tall man I have no idea what you are going to do.2. The band has a tendency to ride up your head and not cover your ears.3. It doesn't keep water out of your ears. You get water in them but they aren't completely dry.
3,Sounds good,"Bike sounds much better now than with stock exhaust. These make it idle fairly low but it growls when you open it up. Easy to install, even for a novice."
1,How a bad translation was made,"Thankfully there are now much better translations of Genji available in English. But if you ever want to write a bad translation of a classic novel and shoot for some sort of literary prize to honor your achievement, this will clearly be a book to imitate. I agree with the other reviewer that it would have been nice for Seidensticker to explain how he chose certain words, but it's not clear that he made a close examination of Japanese interpretations in the first place."
5,A must-have if you love 90s Jangle Indie rock,"Semi Gloss is a wonderful band that provides a timeless, fresh sound. I first discovered them by hearing ""The Sunburn Song"", off of their self titled debut, on an episode of The Adventures Of Pete and Pete. A few days ago I started looking up a little more on them, and found this album. I could tell from the 30 second samples, even, that this was greatness, and bought it. It came in yesterday, and is currently on repeat on my iPod.This band has a sad demise, as this album was supposed to be released in 1999 sometime, but their label, Dirt Records, delayed the release, and as a result, Semi-Gloss went on a hiatus and never came back. I'm glad they eventually released it.If you like bands like Miracle Legion, Polaris, or Nice, you're going to love this. It's a steal (if you buy a used copy that is...I wasn't willing to shell out $85 for a new copy!)"
3,Cute but not needed...,"Cute looking chair, looks very comfortable. My daughter love it but she won't stay in on place for long so she could turn her body and start crawling while the pod is still attached. One time she roll over on the floor. (Good thing it is design to sit on the floor.)To tell you the truth, the mat is cute but useless. It create more jobs for you when your kids will find the way to grab, pull and destroy it. My curious 9 mths grab and make it wrinkle right away, on her first sit. The plastic tray is detachable and very easy to clean."
2,slip slidin' away!,"My sister had a pod seat for my niece, and she seemed to love it, so when I saw this one online, I thought my little girl would love it. While the tray that is included with place mats and a toy is a nice touch, I was not that pleased with the actual seat. The foam is coated in a very slick, slippery coating that makes sitting up difficult for my daughter, and the dip in the back of the seat is very shallow. I was hoping this one would have a deeper dip in the seat and a more powdery coating on the foam to facilitate sitting upright, like the one my sister purchased. Instead my daughter slips and slides everytime I use it."
3,Strong Chemical Smell,"I found the BebePod to have a very strong chemical smell. I couldn't stand the smell and couldn't image having a new baby around it, so I returned it. It reminded me of a foam workout mat I once owned that had this strong chemical smell for all the years I owned it (and hardly ever used because of of it).I purchased the Bumbo seat and found it to have almost no smell. They sell a tray attachment for it now too, so except for the toy the BebePod Plus comes with it does the same job for less money."
5,Wonderful Baby Seat,"I originally had the Bumbo seat and I finally talked my husband into buying the Pod after we got the Bumbo tray and it pinched my daughters arms. We love this seat. She sits so much better in this chair because her knees can actually bend, unlike the Bumbo where they stick straight out. My daughter is 6 months old and we use this chair to feed her. She loves the toy that comes with it. I put her on the counter and work in the kitchen while she plays. Great buy and you're not really spending more on this because once you have to buy the tray attachment for the Bumbo, the price is the same."
4,Bebepod,"I bought the bebepod chair for my son. At the time he was 3 months old. He was beginning to want to sit up all the time, so I thought he would love this chair. At first he would slide in the chair and slump to the side. He is now 4 months and he sits up great in it. He loves the toy. The tray is a must, it helps hold him in. I have tried to use the chair without the tray, but he is able to stretch himself out of the chair. If you are going to buy the chair, I would definately recommend only getting the one with the tray."
2,disappointment,"i had to return this product as soon as i received it. it's a great idea, to have your little one learn how to sit in his own little chair, but the reality is, it doesn't offer great support. it states that it's for children as old as 3 months (i'm not sure if this one stated that it's from birth), as long as they're able to support their heads, as it will teach your baby to sit. the back of this chair is way too low, so even if your 3 month old could hold up his little head, it doesn't offer back support, not to mention, the seating isn't very spacious, and then when you add the tray to it, there is less room for your little one, especially if he has a little belly on him. this is definitely not for slightly bigger babies, had i to choose again, i would go with the bumbo."
3,pommel won't stay on,"I'm very disapointed with my bebe pod plus. My baby is 7 months old and can pull the pommel off with very little effort. The directions were to put the pommel on and push down to snap it on. It barely snaps. It also said to twist pommel to remove, but all you have to do is barely touch it.The chair would be so helpful and useful to me if the pommel didn't comeof so easy. Without the pommel I'm afraid to put my baby in it."
3,I should have bought a Bumbo,"This product is exactly what it is advertised as. I didn't find anything especially wrong with it, but I don't really like using this chair. My son got this as soon as he turned 3 months old. Almost immediately his legs were too chubby for me to feel comfortable putting the tray or knob on it. (I'm afraid I'm going to pinch him.) I also cloth diaper, so his butt is a bit chunkier, making it even more difficult to get him into this thing.I have a feeling we would both enjoy a Bumbo more.That being said, the toy that comes with the tray is pretty cool. I wish it had a stand (other than the tray) so we could use it without the bebe pod or me having to hold it in front of my son."
1,don't buy,"I bought this product looking for an alternative to a high chair (for many reasons). It is not a good product. It looks very nice, ""cool"" design, BUT the baby cannot stay upright (and my baby can sit unassisted). Her back is very curved, and she is looking at the floor all the time. She is also touching the floor all the time (what a mess!). It is difficult to feed her. Also, my baby felt very trapped and did not enjoy sitting in the bebepod. The only nice thing about this product is the toy that comes with it. A last thing: the plastic/rubber this thing is made off has a horrible smell. It does not go away and all the baby's clothes (and the baby) continue smelling the same way untill washed!!Don't buy this product. I am returning it."
2,get the one without the tray,My daughter like this chair but when i put the tray on she keeps poping it off with her legs she is only four months old and we won't be able to use the tray for much longer as its getting to tight.So i'm terrified that she is going to fall out of it.
4,cool toy,My child likes this seat and loves the toy it comes with. The bad: she is very small and will fall over to one side when seated.
2,Not 4 my baby,"The bebe pod plus hasn't proven to be the product that I anticipated. Each time I have tried to put my baby in the bebe pod, she leans to one side and cries. It may be that she simply doesn't like the bebe pod, but I haven't had much success with this product. She does like the toy attachment, but I think I could have found a much cheaper teething toy. I plan to continue trying to use the bebe pod as she gets older, she is currently 5 months old."
4,Nice Change of View for my baby,"I like the attachements (tray, toy & mats). It helps hold up my 4 month old to where she isn't wobbely and can sit more steadily. She enjoys sitting on the table when eating becuase she is at eye level with the family. I use it mostly to feed her. I do not leave her unattended...she can topple over."
2,Wont strip tile of grim,"I'm no tile expert. I was expecting this item to strip the tile completely of grim, old sealer. It did neither.+ Fast Shipping- Didn't work"
3,Not a big fan,"It has a sweet and spicy scent to it. It took some getting use to, but I really don't wear it that much."
1,Chinese elm bonsai,The tree on the ad is totally different from the tree received! The one I got looks bad! I returned it the next day! Highly not recommend this.
1,Bass Cd,The Only Thing This Cd Is Good For Is Song Five Caprice Musik And The Only Reason I Like That Song Is Because It Has Rediculiously Large Amounts Of Bass It So Loud But Tum Tum Week Save Your Money A Burn Song 5.
4,Hukilau Hulas,This was a great start at looking at Hapa Haole Hula classics and gives one the feeling of being in Hawaii.
1,Don't Buy!,Don't buy this book. Extremely over-priced for minimal amount of information in the book. It is only an article made in book form.
3,Pamphlet not a book,"I enjoy Drucker's work and writings and usually have no complaints. However, this is a pamphlet, not a book. It is a mere 57 pages and it actually fits in my back pocket. I didn't read the description very well and thought I was getting a great deal -- a Drucker tome for under $10.This is definitely good, high-quality Drucker -- just in bite size."
5,Still timely advice.,I gave copies to six of my adult children and grandchildren. Everyone was enthused and promised to apply Drucker's advice.
1,This book is the size of an iPhone!!,"There are about 5 equivalent pages in this book to a real size book. Good advice, but there's not much of it. Not worth $9."
4,Learn To Be A Self-Employed Employee,"My title sounds paradoxical. What I learned from Mr. Drucker's pamplet is that we all must be responsible for our career paths. Instead of seeing ourselves as employee for ABC, Inc., we should focus on gaining skills, and most importantly, know who we are as individuals. Too many people today let other people dictate what they should do in their careers. Is it any wonder we see people ""going postal"" at their jobs. Just look at what happened in New York City on Friday. A man hunts down his former employer and shoots him dead!?!?!Granted situations like Friday's murder are rare. But I believe if people would see themselves as independent contractors, they wouldn't see their employers as an extention of mommy or daddy."
1,Groove Merchant,"As a hugh Bob Baldwin fan, I was extremely excited to get a live performance. However, this DVD is very disappointing because of the very sub-par audio quality. It is as though someone pulled up with a cheap recorder and did an improptu recording. I am surprised Bob would subscribe to its issuance."
5,Old Fashioned charm,This book was given to me as a gift and I felt like I was transported back in time to a more innocent period. It was so refreshing and pure. My children loved it and I enjoyed it very much.
3,"Decent Speakers for Price, But Beware!","For the price, these speakers are not a bad deal. However, they are a bit misleadng. They do require batteries or a dc adapter, however, they will also drain the power from its source. As it does so, the speaker quality decreases dramatically. For example, I use this with my iPod. I used it over two days for a total of about 8 hours. The first day the iPod was fully charged and the batteries in the speakers were brand new. The sound quality was surprisingly good. By about hour 4 I noticed that songs with bass sounded crappy and that my iPod was close to being dead. As I let the unit play the quality got worse and the iPod went completely dead. As soon as I plugged the iPod into the wall charger the speaker quality returned to its original clarity."
2,Good While it Lasted,"The speaker sounded good, but in less than two weeks, it stopped working. The product was only used by an adult and definitely was not mishandled in any way. Save your money and go for something a bit more substantial."
1,Don't do it!,"I read reviews that this was a great deal. I disagree! This is the worst thing I have ever bought. The sound is very small, my speakers in my laptop are louder than these were! Save your $5! It was cheap and horrible and I am very upset with my purchase! I put batteries in and the plastic started smoking. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THESE SPEAKERS!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't Buy For MP3 Players!,"The pic for this product shows the MP3 player cradled right-side up. If your MP3 has its headphone jack on the bottom edge, this speaker set-up forces you to plug the MP3 in upside-down to fit in the cradle. This makes the cradle worthless.The USB cable allows you to plug in the speakers to your computer without using batteries, but the cable is too short for most situations.The sound is decent but too weak to compete with anything short of silence.If you have a stereo system, buy an audio cable that will connect your MP3 player (through the headphone jack) for proper sound levels. They are cheaper than this speaker set.If you want something portable that's not disappointing, your going to have to spend more money."
3,Perfect for kids or the lake...,"These are pretty good little speakers for the price. We got each of our 3 children one for their new iPods and they are perfect for their rooms! They are battery operated, too, so we can take it to the lake and if something happens to it, it was a GREAT price! It even folds up and can be thrown into a beach bag easily. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because we have had to open up two of them and re-secure the little speaker inside the frame already. But it was an easy fix..."
3,Get what you pay for,"I bought a package deal with car and house charger as well as the retractable USB connector. The speakers are nice as they play powered by either USB or 4 AAA batteries. I have had the speakers for less than a week but they will do for average listening. There is no low frequency so they will sound tinney. If you are looking for a Bose surround sound... buy Bose. Otherwise, if you are looking to be headphone free, they are a good buy."
5,Good for the price!,"I got this product relatively quickly, I've had it for a year almost, and I stillllll use it! I use it in my car sometimes too! The sound is sort of fuzzy when I turn my ipod and the speakers all the way up, but, I adjust it so that it's not fuzzy.....the volume is crazy loud for a small set of speakers though! Definitely would recommend them if you need some portable speakers."
1,Ach,"Have not use this item yet. Expected to recieve item that was not included, (also not listed) not the fault of the sender. Without said item (car charger) unit is somewhat useless to me."
3,Good for what it is...,Fast delivery and good service. Great for some extra sound for a portable device but not mind-blowing. Definitely worked great for our ten year old.
1,seller does not stand behind product,I'm giving this product 1 star simply because the seller did send me the product. BUT I ordered this product to keep in our camper durring our summer camping season. Because of a busy schedule we only got to go twice. The first time camping I used this product 1 time & it worked. We went camping againover Laborday weekend & the product didn't work @ all. I contacted the seller to let them know the product only worked for 1 weekend & the seller said there was nothing they could do about it. THIS SELLER DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THERE PRODUCTS!
2,I don't know what I was expecting for less than five dollars....,"These speakers are horrendous. Pure static no matter how many times I plug in/out the plug. Also the volume level doesn't get THAT loud unless I have my iphone (version 4) on full volume. The louder the music is, the more static-y it is as well. If it were worth with the shipping costs I would definitely return this, however I don't think it is.Future Buyers: Don't waste your time! If I were to do it over, I would invest in something more expensive, from the beginning, it definitely is worth it!"
5,Awesome Speakers,"These speakers are outstanding, I love them! I have no complaints except that the bass is a tad muddy at a very low pitch. Despite that, they sound great. The way power is delivered to these speakers by 4 AAA batteries or a USB cord. I'll probably buy a USB wall outlet so i don't need a computer...Anyways these speakers are great"
4,Valuable speaker...,This works well with devices that have crummy little speakers but have an earphone attachment connection. Has good sound for such a small item. Would give it five stars if it amplified the volume more than it does.
4,HELP,i just got the speakers and they're great....but I thought the cable was included...how can I buy it? does anyone know how?
4,good for the price,"I got this for my iPod and it works okay. It's a little tinny on the sound, but for the price, it isn't bad. I like it just fine as I don't have to wear earphones all the time to hear my music."
2,Not reliable,"Looks nice, good sound, but the first time I turned them on, left speaker died right away. Now what I do with it?And right speaker doesn't want to fold.Very dissatisfied!"
4,Mini Ipod speaker,"Love it, love it, love it!Not a big pricey item obviously, but what a great sound and perfect for the kitchen!"
4,Mini but powerful,"This speaker system is ideal for the office. The sound quality is great if you're looking for a speaker to play background music. At the highest volume level, the quality is obviously not phenomenal, esp if you're playing anything with bass.The product is great because you have the option of using batteries or the USB cable that is included with the speakers. If you have any security issues at work with plugging in third party cables into your computer, this product will not affect your computer.The only downside is you can't seem to have your phone *anywhere* near the speakers. Even at 6 feet away, it creates static noise in the speakers that is completely unbearable."
1,Don't,"OMG where do i start, first a big problen is that the battery conections are so bad it will most likely stop working after a little use. When i called about the connections and some of the other problems u see below, a chinees gentleman pick up who could hardly speak english and he gave me a sorry ass atitude when i complained. The sound, well it sounds like static all the time. You can still here ur music but the quality is awful!Even for 5 dallors its not worth it. I got it back when it was only 2 dallors, it was not worth that!!!! I ended up getting a different speaker. it was a prity penny but let me tell u what i got is soooooo much better. If ur looking for a speaker for an ipod or any type of musical divice with an aux line, get the SKULLCANDY PIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SKULCANY is an amazing brand. I have never had a problem with the pipe and i have had it about three months. I have recomended it sooooo many times in those 3 months."
4,Decent waveform generator for the price,"The kit arrived on time and went together easily. The assembly instructions were clear and the total time to get it up and running was perhaps 2 hours. The fit and finish on the case could be a little better, but with just a little coaxing everything went together.The unit operates as described. There is some waveform distortion towards the very high end of the frequency range, but that was expected.Overall the unit works well. For the price, it's hard to beat."
3,"It's so, so","The pan looks and feels good but the bottom is not flat. It has an arch, so when you bake a cake the cake is not the same thickness through out.When you wash the pan and press down on the bottom of it, it snaps back and you have to snap it back into place when your done.I hope this makes sense."
3,a little thin,"The 1812 stainless steel seems a little thin to me. After first use the bottom bowed up. The pan still works... it just looks ""off""."
3,Cheap and shallow,"Sadly, I returned this pan as it was cheaply made of thin metal meaning you would most likely burn baked goods before they were finished baking.The pan sides all seemed to be rather shallow and I don't know if a standard 9 x 13-inch cake would have fit in this pan.Save your money and look elsewhere as this pan may look pretty but it seems to be sadly lacking in details."
3,"mediocre atlas, not very clear maps","its ok. the map section is not very clear. there are a lot of strange overlaps and the lines between states and countries are almost the same. sometimes i have to look really really hard to figure out what country im looking at. some countries are given huge, blown up detail and some dont even have a page, other than the whole continent view.also, the maps part is only a small section of the atlas. for the amount of total pages, there arent very many maps."
3,Needs improved binding and printing,"Print size and clarity are fine in this atlas but the inside margin and binding doesn't allow you to see the map centers. Alot of each map is hidden due to the center margin going to the edge of the paper. You can not read or see the center of the maps. I may see if I can have the book binding cut and place it in a 3 ring binder. At least I will be able to see the map, though it won't line up side by side or page to page."
4,Great Colors,Absolutely love the blue and green stones. It coordinates with so many summer outfits. The clasp is a little small and hard to work is the only negative.
2,Not Much of a Tribute,"""The Vocal Ballad Community"" are unnamed vocalists who perform each of the songs on this album. I first thought that I had a problem with my CD Player as the music clearly lacks crisp definition and range. Okay for a garage sale at $2.50, but should not be priced in the range of the ""Real McCoy"". Disappointed. You should buy the real Dion instead."
1,THIS TRIBUTE IS ESTUPIDO,"FIRST OF ALL WHY IN THE HELL DOES THIS ALBUM EXIST? THIS IS A TOTALLY RIP OFF. THIS IS A WORST TRIBUTE I'VE EVER HEARD. THIS TRIBUTE IS NOT GOOD. THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. THE IDEA OF CELINE DION IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. THE SONGS ARE TOTALLY AWFUL AND YOU CAN NOT HEAR THE SONGS. THIS ALBUM DOSE NOT WORTH IT. UUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGH!! THESE GIRLS BETTER GO AND RUIN OTHER ALBUMS. WELL, THIS ABLUM DOESN'T AFFECT CELINE. SHE IS STILL THE ONE. THE ALBUM IS PURE CRAP. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Funny and insiteful,"I thought this was a great book for learning more about The Bible. There are many facts that you don't even notice until it is broken down to the ridiculous. This book gave me many laughs and challenges. This book is a great gift for any Christian, especially trivia buffs."
3,Lots of facts,This book contains a lot of facts. I was primarily interested in it for use with a group of children. It is a bit more advanced and in-depth than they are ready for. Granted it was a 3.99 book (the shipping cost more than the book) but it is printed on mediocre paper akin to cheap paperback novels. It's just not quite what I was expecting.
2,I didn't like this book,"I had high hopes for this book because my son likes trains and chocolate. I thought the pictures would look similar to his other Thomas the Train books but they didn't. The colors were very muted and the trains small. Plus there was way too many words to read to a 3 year old. I don't think the story was that interesting to read. Anyway, I should have read closers that there were a couple of other stories in this book and not just the one cholocate crunch story. Therefore, my son got lost in this book and thought the train looked old and dirty and not covered in chocolate. The front cover picture actually looks better than what is inside."
3,"Good, but not our favorite","My son is just over 3 and is more of a lots of pictures a little less on the words kid when it comes to books. This has book has several good stories in it, and might be better for a slightly older child or one with a better attention span! The pictures are stills from the series and my son also seems to like the books with drawings a bit more - all that being said he does enjoy the book but it is not his favorite."
2,Only three stories,I was surprised that the book only contains three small stories. I do not think it is worth the money
1,kattywatty,"Didn't care for this book. Sent it right back...should have done the sample first. I have ordered other Thomas Tank Engine books but this one was not the same format. I let my 2 year old ggson pick the book and he selected it by the picture on the front. He laughed when he saw it. The trouble with this book is...while it has more than one story...the writing is small and the pictures are not big and bright. I started to read to him and he said ""no "". So i sent it back and got a different book."
3,Good book for Thomas fans,"Easy to read, with enough images to hold a typical 2 year old's attention. Has a few short stories. A good addition to our son's Thomas collection."
3,These are good if you don't sweat a lot,I purchased these to put them in my Extreme Rage 2.0 single pane mask. They work on people who weigh about 100 lbs. and don't sweat a lot (kids) but they did not work well for me (I'm a 240lb. beast (as the kids call me)). They filled up between the panes with wetness (It was lightly drizzling out and very humid). I thought that they had a waterproof seal I guess not. I sold these to some of the kids in the church youth group and bought me an Empire Helix mask which hasn't fogged yet!
4,The Nazi regime through the eyes of five people.,"I have checked out this book a number of times from the libray. This is a fascinating book of the beginning of the Nazi Regime. Jews are discriminated against and deprived of their job. One of the friends of those who are writing about this regime kill herself, rather than face the loss of her job. A Gestapo agent puts roadblocks in the way of the SA and SS killing machines and is himself threatened. One can see how this regime threatened and killed its way to total power.This is a nice read of the beginning of Hitler's regime. People opposed him, and paid the price. This is how power was transferred to a small group of people."
5,You must add this work to your collection,"This is one of the most incredible pieces of music I've ever heard. If you notice, no reviewer has given less than 5 stars. If I could give more, I would. I began listening to this in the 80's off an album that belonged to a friend. I made a rough recording with a microphone onto a cassette and listened for years. Then it wore out and broke. I was without this music for over ten years when I found a used CD on ebay. Now it has resurffaced to the delight of many. I hope that people will find this and embrace it's timeless beauty and anointed lyrics/music. It is truly a masterpiece!"
4,"Some Fluff, but Good Animation and Kami-sama Arc","The art style and animation quality (smoothness of action, etc.) are definitely better in Saiyuki Reload than they were in Saiyuki.The Japanese voice actors are the same for both Saiyuki and Saiyuki Reload, and they're awesome in both.Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, most of the episodes in Saiyuki Reload are fluffy filler episodes. The bath house (onsen) episode (episode 10) is terribly cute and funny, though, and Saiyuki Reload does cover the Kami-sama arc (episodes 17 through 25), which is very serious and pretty pivotal to the series.The Urasai (behind-the-scenes clips) are funny too, and they come at the end of each episode.If you like the Saiyuki series, you should at least grab the Kami-sama epsiodes from Saiyuki Reload (episodes 17 through 25, discs 5 through 7)."
3,Used Book,"This was definitely a used book, it showed its age in yellowing pages. However, it is still readable and I plan on reading it soon."
5,Excellent as a reference and art history,"More than just a summary presentation of the Getty's extensive holdings, ""Handbook of the Photographs Collection"" provides an excellent history of the art and science of photography. That the material at the Getty alone would provide for such a discourse speaks volumes of the depth and breadth of their collection. This one stays on my coffee table."
1,Worst Tutorial Ever,This could have been a five star little intro to Microsoft Access but the editor failed to have one person try to follow the book from start to finish. Extremely important information (like the data you need in the tables to complete future assignments) is missing. I had to skip ahead several chapters and based on screenshots fill-in some limited info so I could sort-of continue following the book. In it's current condition the book is not worth buying.
4,ill debut keeps heads wonderin whats to come..,"An album that grabs your attention from start to finish. IF you're a true hip-hop head listen to the intro and see if you can figure out the timeline. The beats are indeed worth a good number of rewinds. Listen to the man raimetaphor spew venom over the tracks. One notable track is ""Listen up"" featuring Breez Evaflowin (underground heads know who he is out of the Stronghold click). Plain and simple you won't be disappointed ill from beginning to end. Like redman said ""pick it up pick it up"""
2,This book could use a few more edits,"If you are looking for a book dealing with the history or beliefs of the Cathars, look elsewhere. I have the horrible feeling that this book would have been wonderful if only the author had simply told the story instead of explaining every thought along the way and using a sort of daily entry or diary format. The story is fascinating, about a woman who has a rememberance of being a Cathar during the 1300's. Unfortunately, the writing style is so poor that the story is all but lost and the reader spends much time just trying to remember who all the characters are. Keeping track of the story line is all but impossible. Too bad. It could have been a good book but I wouldn't recommend it as it is."
4,solid proof,"I found this book a bit difficult to read, but very well worth the trouble. That's because, assuming the author did his homework honestly and accurately (as I do), this is a record of spontaneous (not hypnosis-induced) memories, recorded by a credentialed psychiatrist, for which there are corresponding detailed historical records (records she was very unlikely to have known of, especially when she wrote down her memories as a school-girl). Not one historically-recorded person only, but several people mentioned in the patient's recollections are verified as having actually existed, along with places. This has been done before, but rarely so completely.The book also gives a very good sense of what the Cathars were like, and it brings up an interesting question--which group was the more ""heretical""--the Cathars, or the politically dominant Catholic Church which persecuted them?And its companion question: does might always make right?"
1,Small bracelet,"I`m beyond disppointment. For that price I was expecting a bracelet for a woman, not for a girl or a doll. The general description doesn't include length, which is 4.5''. Such an importante detail and the seller forgot to include it on the product description, or he did it on purpose. All and all I'll never buy from this seller again."
5,Super Awesome,"The item is as pictured! And it got here on time! I love Yuki, its so cute! Perfect to brighten up whatever you hang it on!"
4,Had one for 12 years - finally wore out,Bought one of these 12 years ago. The impeller in the pump wore out once and replaced. It works really well. I've had smaller fish get caught on the intake and die. Keeps water crystal clear. Finally had to buy a another filter because on the old filter the impeller mount on the bottom wore enough that it doesn't seat properly and doesn't turn and just rattles. Very pleased with the performance. Not bad for running continuously for twelve years.
5,Great for Turtles.,"I have a Red Eared Slider in a 30 gallon tank, he is on the brink of being too large for his tank. This filter works so great. I had a smaller one, but turtles are dirty little creatures, so he needed something better. I only have to change his water every 4 weeks now, no lie. I was doing water changes one a week or more. I have been using the carbon only, but I recently started with the ohter filter as well...so different that I can see."
4,Good FIlter,"Good filter for the aquarium, a little noise sometimes and requires little maintenance. The delivery was right on time"
1,Doesn't work,"This filter is crap. The outlet is too short so it's slightly above the (full) water line. So you have the rushing water noise to contend with. Also, the filter itself is very noisy. You can hear water running inside the filter along with the loud motor. It doesn't appear to clean my freshwater 55G worth a darn. I bought it for the micro-filtering capability, but my tank looks exactly the same after running the filter overnight.I've found this quality is the same for the Magnum line. This filter doesn't work at all as advertised and neither does the Magnum HOT ""sit on floor"" style of canister filter. Both are extremely noisy and don't filter any better than my Eheim canisters."
1,I hate this filter,This filter never stops blowing bubbles. Sometimes it blows large bublles(like when someone walks by and shakes the tank a little) but mostly it blows micro bubbles. I do not recommend this product.
3,Not as good as expected...,"This product cleans, but will always run with micro-bubbles. Your aquarium will look great like a sparkling water bottle just opened. Crystal clear, but micro-bubbles all over."
1,Blows bubbles like it is its job! BAD PRODUCT!,"I bought this filter about a month ago and have had nothing but bad luck. The filter worked for about 2 weeks and then started blowing bubbles. It looked like there was a blizzard in my tank except with air bubbles, it was terrible. If you screw with the position of the intake tube or exhaust tube sometimes the bubbles will stop. Well today the bubble got to be just terrible and I had had enough. I am in the process of trying to seal and glue the intake and exhaust tube with rtv. I won't be able to move either, but, if it makes the darn thing work it'll save me from having to buy something else. This is not the type of situation I expect to be in with a brand new filter. Total garbage. If you are considering this filter do yourself a favor and get something else. This filter is an expensive headache!"
4,Not Bad,Just got this a few weeks ago. It was a good price at almost half the pet store price. Happy so far
5,Awesome filter!,"I have a 55 gallon tank that I house 3 turtles in. This filter is AWESOME! It cleans better than any other canister filter that I have owned. Its easy to clean and set up. Not to mention, it has NO TUBING! Which means my 2 year old cant pull the tubing down. I love this filter and am glad I purchased it! I highly recommend this canister filter!"
1,Design Flaws.. can't prime,"I don't know why no one talks about it, but this filter is flawed in its design. There are a lot of forum thread on-line talking about the fact that this thing is a pain to prime. Or if it even pumps at all. Unfortunately I found out the hard way, because I learned only after I've purchased one. After 2 hours of inspecting every single o-ring, and filter component and trying to get it to pump correctly I've given up. Some forum postings suggest that the product may be defective, but if there are so many people with the same problem, there is something wrong with the product, not the users. I strongly suggest you read about this in other sites before you decide to purchase. As for me, this one is going back to the seller."
1,bad item,worked for a month changed filter and then day later didnt work again i will never buy a marineland filter again after this. just all of a sudden stooped sucking up water
3,everything as described,This is a good product for a larger tank i ported this on a 15 gallon to create a stream like flow. It provides quite circulation and has excellent filtration. If you hear a flushing noise air is trapped in the top and simply by lifting and submerging the system you can get rid of the air. The only problem i have with it is that the exhaust is to small so it creates to much current so fashion yourself a piece of plastic or put some mesh over the exhaust so that it doesnt hurt the plants or fish.Edit:It is a cheap product in that it will leak if you dont adjust the clamp to be sealed shut it also takes in air so you might have to change the O and D rings of the product.
1,A Big Waste of Money!!,"I used this on a 35 gal saltwater tank for only a few months before I gave up on it altogether in frustation! From the start, I could tell it was very cheaply made. Every time you clean it, getting the lid back on requires three hands and a great deal of patience because of an extremely poor design. Then, you factor in that it is designed to run only carbon with a flimsy little bit of filter media that is supposed to be your mechanical filtration. After only a few months of use, and frequents cleanings, it was moving almost no water and then one day I just couldn't get the stupid thing back together at all. I was only to happy to throw the thing in the trash and off to the local fish store to buy the Eheim I should have bought the first time! Do Not Waste your Money on this thing!!"
1,"Not what you would expect from a ""cookbook""","I'm still slogging through this weighty tome but so far it hasn't provided much in the way of solutions. This book might be a nice reference for someone who's at the point where they want to address obscure SGML problems, it definitely isn't appropriate for someone new to SGML."
1,Irreverent Advice,"I thought this would be an insiders guide;things not covered by usual guide books,undiscovered gems,restaurants etc.It wasn't.This is just a poorly laid out, same old same old, guide book,don't waste your money."
5,LOVE this DVD box set!!,"I was 9-10 years old when I first saw this series on Toonami in 2002 and I have been in love with it ever since then. I LOVE G Gundam. This is my 1st Gundam series. So many wonderful childhood memories of watching the episodes after school and playing with my G Gundam action figures. It has a wonderful storyline and very developed characters. The series has action, suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy. I am a very satisfied customer. Buying this DVD box set is a dream come true for me."
1,NO JODAS!,"TRIBUTO A RICKY MARTIN? very early i think, he s still alive! heh he but this cd really does nt worth it, u better buy all the ricky martin collection and don t waste ur money buying this item"
2,High expectations failed.,"I had high expectations for this game, but was very disappointed by it. First, the story did not interest me at all. It also seemed to make no sense, and went all over the place. Second, the gameplay wasn't good. I got lost many times because it didn't clarify what to do or where to go. The maps were very confusing. I would avoid this game if at all possible."
2,Save Your Money,"If it were 2001, and this were a Nintendo game, it might be OK. But for an XBOX game it is very lightweight and poorly-implemented. It's on par with some of the late 90s PC shooters, early Nintendo games, or the first versions of ""Wolfenstein"", but is almost painfully low-tech when it comes to game play on an XBOX. I got it for $30, but I would not recommend you buy it for more than $10"
3,Strokes crossed with Hot Hot Heat,"Really, it's like they met in Toronto and had a love child and this is it... if that's your cup of tea, I highly recommend this disc... I usually stay away from anything labled by the press as 'garage' anything, but after some very positive reviews, I wanted to give it a listen... better than almost anything on the radio, but what is that really saying?I'll give it a few more spins for sure, but it will likely end up in the 'going back to the record store toward a music upgrade' pileAnd now, back to 'The Fiery Furnaces'.... ""YEEEAAAHHHHHHHHH!!"""
3,atypical Fripp,I like Fripp when he is a bit more edgy. This album is a bit too ambient for my tastes and seems to lack coherence. I compare this with his current work with A. Belew and find that I miss Adrian's contribution. When I purchased this CD I was hoping for more of the softer music that Fripp does with King Crimson.
5,Fripp at his best: music is our friend,"I almost didn't buy this CD. I had been somewhat disappointed with ""Let the Power Fall"" as a representation of the Frippertronics concerts of that era. Perhaps because it could not compare to being at the Kitchen and experiencing the tangible wash of sound, surrounded by standing waves as my friend explained. The physical reality of sound. I recall that if I would shift my position as I sat on the hardwood floor, if I'd shift just a few inches, I would enter another sonic space. I was aware of the physical boundary of sound waves floating in the air. Maybe I just had a crappy sound system at home? I don't think that's it.I have listened to this CD on lo-fi computer speakers with the same sense of evocation. Perhaps only one cut - the title cut - leaves me a bit distracted because of the vocoder. But I have learned to appreciate this excerpt, if only for the poetry itself."
3,Surely another Soundscape was worthy,"On their own merits, I found these performances to be moving examples of this type of work by Fripp. I was, however, disappointed by the inclusion of a previously-released Soundscape ('Midnight Blue,' from ""A Blessing of Tears"")."
3,"Too repetative, too repetative","Although the CD is a nice change of pace if you mainly listen to country, much of it is too repetative. How many times in a row do you need to hear ""mmm got a crick in my neck mmm got a crick in my neck""? A few of the other songs have phrases that get old after the 20th time in the song too."
3,Rapping Cowboy,"Heard a song and thought to check the rest of them out. They are alright. I like different kinds of music and now some Cowboy Troy. If this is in your taste as well, then this is for you as well."
1,Unbelievably Terrible!,"This review won't be too comprehensive, considering that I couldn't force myself to listen to more than 3 or 4 of the sample tracks before I stomped my headphones to death.Pop-Country [Pountry] and Cheesy White-boy Rap: two bad tastes that taste bad together. It took me a while to figure out that this wasn't some dork-assed Wierd Al Yankovic parody. Shortly after that, I saw that it was ranked #76 in music sales. And shortly after that, I shed a tear for our pathetic popular culture. Hick-hop? This fool, 'Cowboy Troy', should be ashamed of himself (of course, he's probably instead laughing with glee, rolling in his piles of money that he bilked from poor unsuspecting trailer-park bottom-feeders.) I'm embarrassed to even have this Amazon page in my browser history---I can only imagine the shame that is brought on by actually paying money for it."
1,Pretty bad,"From someone who enjoys hip-hop music, this album is horrendous. Cowboy Troy has some of the worst rhymes ever recorded. Most of the tracks are unbearable. My brother bought this album on a whim, and I quickly put it in my iPod.I feel like my new iPod is now contaminted, and I think about throwing it against the wall every time I try to listen to this album.However, fans of country might enjoy this album. I know I just bashed it pretty bad, but I am not a country fan, so I can't speak to how a country fan would feel about this album.I will say this: the album is so bad, I actually took the time to write my first review ever on Amazon."
1,"DEFINATELY ""NOT"" COUNTRY","Since I am a DJ, I will lay it straight on the line... This so called hick hop is NOT country, no matter if Big & Rich and Nashville claim it to be. Tim McGraw can like it all he wants, but the point is, it still not country. Just because he wears a cowboy hat and claims himself to be a cowboy, his music is far from country music no matter how many steel guitars and banjos are in it. CMT can play it all day and all night, but I will never play this so called hick hop anywhere."
1,you're playing chicken with a train,"Any discerning rap or country fan couldn't get past the horrible rapping. This is just terrible. I laugh at all of you who like this trash, because Cowboy Troy is a joke, and so are you. And this isn't the good kind of joke, where everybody emerges unscathed in the end. It's the kind where, if you're unfortunate enough to supercede it, you'll realize how stupid you were and lose all self-respect. Your own life will become inconsequential, and as you reach out desperately for meaning, the record execs and I still will be laughing, only this time we may be dancing on your grave too."
1,LOCO MUSIC,"Do not buy this album! Unless you like weak 1982 rhymes over played out country-rock music.I love rap and country music so I thought I would give this album a try, even though I really didn't care for the first single ""I play chickin' with the train"". After the first couple of songs I knew right away I wasn't going to like it. It sounds like vanilla ice hooked up with big n rich. Well sorry, Vanilla has a lot more soul than Troy. You'll find it hard to like even one song. I would only recommend this to people who like the first single because basically that is what the whole album sounds like.Bottom line...Cowboy Troy just put rap music back 23 years with his simplistic corny rhymes over weak repetitive country/rock music.1/5 stars...my vote for worst album of the year!"
1,This SUX,"Like a lot of the new Country musician today, they would not know country music if it kicked them in the privates, you don't blend two types of music, this crap makes me sick. I can't even hear real country music anymore, I have to hear rap, and rock with a fiddle, pathetic! I am sure this stuff would do well if they would put it in the correct music category but it definitely isn't country music.Cowboy is not a style it's a way of life and if you think that this is country then I suggest you move to the projects because YOU AIN'T A COWBOYI can't rate this any lower then it would allow me to, in my opinion it a -5000 stars"
2,not what i thought,"i figured that if i liked big & rich's cd, ""horse of a different color"" as much as i do that i would enjoy this one. while there are a few good songs on here, it has far too much rap (meaning all) for my taste. i was hoping to hear troy sing!"
1,Hip Hop Rap Pushing in on Country No Way,"Calling yourself Cowboy doesn't make it Country!This fool is too lame for the MTV's, or BET's rap hip hop scene, so he thinks he can push his music off on Country fans. This CD is in the wrong category if you a country fan don't be fooled. This CD is hip hop rap. Young night clubbers hate his music or else he'd be on the rap charts. People buy Country to stay clear of rap.If he had a nice voice, and actually sang country music I would might enjoy his music.He obviously isn't talented enough to make it in the rap world, so Country is his gimic, to be famous for being the only Country rapper. Okay, someone needs to tell him Country and rap are opposites!"
1,Are you kidding me????,"This is by far the worst thing I have EVER heard. Country rap? Come on, if this guy was put in a room with 50cent and P-Diddy he would be beaten lifeless for humiliating the rap industry. There is no room in American music for country rap and because of that Cowboy Troy will be all but forgotten by next year, or maybe next month. This C.D. is a joke. Don't waste your money, I already wasted 5 minutes of my life listening to this awful excuse for music. It is so hokey that you think you are listening to something on Sesame Street and you expect to hear Bert singing about his rubber ducky. Actually, I would prefer that. I only gave this one star because that's a low as I could go. It doesn't even deserve 1 star."
1,It ain't country,"If a country singer put on some rapper clothes and made a cd, Everybody would scream hate crime and want him/her arrested. All what the music does is make a mockery of country music"
1,Garbage,"This is complete garbage. Who exactly are they trying to appeal to? No self-respecting hardcore country or rap fan would even consider this garbage. They are obviously focusing on the little girl, teeny pop, no musical taste group with this crap. Big and Rich suck too. Please do not buy this (...) and support anymore of this socalled music so that it will stop being made."
3,Music vs. Singing,"I LOVE the musical intros to each of the songs, and the guest artists are great. Unfortunately, Cowboy Troy ruins the songs for me. But if you don't mind rap or people speaking instead of singing a tune, then get the CD. The melodies are awesome, and so are Big & Rich."
5,Truly an amazing and innovative artist,"Cowboy Troy is truly the most innovative artist on the scene right now. Combine his amazing vocal delivery with his mad beats, and you get a recipe for insane genius! I never cease to be astounded by his accomplishments!Not only that, but the man has also created his own genre of music!! Anyone who has heard hick-hop knows it is poised to take over the nation, combining two of the most popular forms of music and embodied by a man with so much charisma as Cowboy Troy. Some of his lyrics are mind-blowingly awesome, and the overall effect of combining the two disparate brands of music overwhelms the faculties.Buy this album now, and pat yourself on the back five years later for being way ahead of the musical curve."
3,Direct fit in Metra kits,"I bought one of these some time back through Amazon. I actually holds 2 plastic CD jewel cases, and fits nicely in the Metra Turbo kit I used for my 1989 Mitsubishi Montero. My only complaint is that the top and bottom line of the pocket are bowed inwards towards eachother, giving the pocket the appearance of a sideways hourglass when you see the completed installation. I'm going to try to remove the pocket and use a hair dryer blower to heat up the plastic to straighten things out...hope I don't ruin it :)"
3,"Psychopharm's ""Bible""","The PDR, published annually and continually updated, is *the* desk reference for any doctor who prescribes prescription medications. It contains detailed information on dosage, contraindictions, med interactions, all the things that the manufacturer's reps aren't likely to mention when selling your doctor on a featured drug.Individuals who take several meds for comorbid chronic conditions will welcome information besides the little orange ""May cause drowsiness"" stickers on the med bottles, and with the available update service will keep and use the PDR for years to come.Am I the only person who removes those stickers and places them on boring things at work?Yours in healing..."
5,does the job,"We purchased this when our son got tubes at 11 months to help keep him from picking at the ear plugs. His tubes were in for about 15 months, and this held up for the whole thing. We used it every day for bath time, and when we went swimming. He pulled at it a bit at first until he was used to it, but after that he didn't even mess with it. Would recommend this product."
3,I guess I didn't know what to expect.,"My daughter has ear tubes. So before our Hawaii vacation I thought this would be a nice edition so we wouldn't lose her earplugs. She picked her color and was excited. When we got it, she tried it on and went in the pool once. Then she kept adjusting it and finally took it off. I couldn't get her to put in on again. The product does what it says, but only if you can keep it on your kid."
3,Very sad...,"The boots look perfect in the picture.They are indeed good quality, but the calf is extremely large!"
3,They are ok,"I like the way they look and they feel ok, but maybe its just me, but they rub me the wrong way and will cause blisters on the top of my foot. I love the way they look though"
2,Don't waste your time here,"The book offers to show you all sorts of querys, stored procedures, rules, and in general the T-SQL language. However, No one ever proof read the book to see if the formulas worked. I've spent so much time ""De-bugging the examples"" I tossed the book out. Makes you wonder what the other reviewers were looking at. What a waste!"
1,"All content removed from CD, only SQL server remains","I bought this book because it advertised that examples and code were on the included CD. Wiley (current publisher)has apparently removed the content without removing the promise of content in the book, on the cover, or in the advertising. I tried to contact Wiley and the author, but got no response from either. Lack of promised content makes this book useless as a weekend crash course."
1,Lots of errors/mistakes,"I would not recommend this book. It barely skims the surface of what you really need to know to become proficient with SQL Server 2000. The book also contains numerous, and I mean numerous, typos, mistakes and incorrect code that will not work."
1,"cheap, overpriced..and 2-prong-not three","very cheap, very flimsy; will it last is the first question that comes to mind. and the plug is really done badly. it is a two-prong plug, so any 3-prong stuff will not work. and most stuff is now 3-prong. how dumb! at no cost difference they could have had a 3-prong recepticle and plug..and made it safe. with 2-prong, there is always the problem of safety. at the 6.40 price..i feel, kinda duped. but not worth the hassle to return. would i buy again, that is a firm NO."
1,Total junk,"I use these alot, and got this to replace a GE timer that had fried.Total junk. The ""manual override"" function is just ""Turn the dial until light is on or off as desired."" You must be freaking kidding me. I got the 15 AMP rated timer, and it's only 2 prong... WTF? You don't run 15 AMPS without ground. Dumb.As other reviewers noted, it's loud, it often doesn't even work properly.Save your money and just look for someone who has already bought one. Chances are they've already determined it stinks and have it sitting in a drawer somewhere unused. They'll give it to you happily."
4,Good but very small,"The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again."
5,Calm my dog please!,"If you have a difficult dog like me, then this is the item for you! My dog hates people besides us and goes mad over delivery men, strangers, anyone else who has the nerve to interrupt her nap! I've been using this for years and this really calms my doggie. Give her one and soon she's out for a couple of hours. I don't know if it's the calming effect or the fact that she loves to sleep, but I really don't know what I'd do without it. She loves the taste and is much happier and tranquil after she's had a few. Highly recommended."
4,worth your money,this headset was a gift to use on skype. it delivers clear sound and great volume and works very well except for intermittent pauses that cause you to miss certain syllables during a conversation. fits great on the head and the mic is easy to adjust. there are also interchangeable color ear covers for customization. for $13.49 it's the best pc headset i've used for the least amount of money. go for it!
3,Its ok,its ok i can't find how to get it to work though. im trying on yahoo but the other people say they can't here me very well.
2,Broke quite quick,The volume control stopped working quite soon - works in certain positions only. The soft covers deteriorated very quickly. Two stars for a relative comfort.
1,"headset good,microphone,bad",The logitech headset and microphone worked well for listening but I could not get the mic to work.
2,3rd time sucks even worse,"This is the 3rd time in six months I've had to replace a Logitech headset. I'm sick of this brand. They used to be great, but now I'd just another guaranteed trip to the store. This (final) time the left side sound went out. I don't have the patience to send it back and hope they replace it. I just want the damned thing to work for a few months before giving out. I take care of my equipment, but sadly Logitech doesn't seem to produce quality products any longer."
4,Great headset,"Once I plugged it in, it worked great...I've had it for 3 months now and I haven't had one problem. CompUSA sells this same item for $39.99 so if you're looking for a cool and great headset get it cheaper at Amazon."
3,Mouth piece too short,"Real comfortable on your head and very light around the ear. But the mouth piece is too short which makes your voice volume appear very low. If you pull the mike closer to your mouth, it sounds great but not very practicle to do this during a conversation."
1,SUCKS!!!,i bought it to use with my skype and the microphone broke down after 2 days!!!!don't buy it
4,Good headset,I got this headset about 6 months ago and it has been working perfectly. The sound quality is great and the mic picks up my voice very well. The only problem I have is that the foam mic cover is starting to come off. Other than that is is a great deal and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Bad Sound Quality,"I was not expecting much in terms of sound quality (for this price), but compared to a cheapie Plantronics headset/mic I thought this would be similar. No, I was wrong. I needed to boost the Treble almost all the way up & reduce the Bass almost all the way down. Even then, the sound is very thin. I suspect that the high range of the speaker is broken (maybe the mid too).Seems from the rest of the reviews that this product (I like other Logitech products) has some quality control problems at the plant."
2,No worth,"Initially I felt good, but in a week or so the mike was not working properly. I need to play with it to make it to work"
1,Complete waste,"I've owned this headset for about two hours. On the first plug-in and use, it worked tolerably well, though the output from my microphone (tested by calling Skype) was rather low). I've changed nothing setting-wise, but 60 minutes later, both the headphone and microphone quality are getting worse. Definitely a piece of junk. Very sorry I wasted money on it."
2,Unacceptable for voice-recognition,"I am in my 2nd week of using Dragon Naturally Speaking 9. The software is highly accurate with the ""cheapy"" headset that came with the software. That cheapy headset broke already and I bought this Logitech headset as a replacement. The voice-recognition software kept getting everything wrong, however, and when I performed a sound-quality check the Dragon software gave it an ""unacceptable"" rating. I am returning this to the store.However, it is lightweight and comfortable as compared to those big over-the-ear headphones. It also has a much more low-profile look than those larger headsets. So for listening to music it may be a good value. I just don't recommend it for dictation."
3,Uncomfortable fit,"Despite the good sound quality, I wouldn't buy this item again because of the way the headset is designed. The headset is designed to fit over the back of the head and continually slides down."
2,Microphone stinks on this one.....,"I bought this to use with Skype. I work out of my home making phone calls, so it's important that I can be heard, and that the quality is good. The first day I used the headset, it worked fine. Today is the second day, and I could barely get the mike to pick up my voice. I could get it to a level where someone would have to strain to hear me, but only by actually touching the mike to my lips, and then you get the pops and crackles on your p's and s's. I'm very disappointed, as I'm usually a Logitech fan."
1,Great when working,"I've gone threw 3 of these cheap Walmart knock offs. When they work they work fine you just have to be smart enough to calibrate a microphone. But the first time you roll over the 20 foot cord, there done. If you can't afford anything else go for it but your better of buying a higher qaulity mic because they break like the cheap headsets that they are."
1,Rating from an owner.,"Bought this headset a while ago for online gaming, and it worked alright. However, after about two weeks, it started to act up, by this I mean it would stop working and start again. I thought that my set was defective and got another one, but the new one acted the same way. The only way to get it to work for atleast a minute is to twist the plug until people can hear you or replug it(both take about 10min of trial and error). So, I recommend a USB headset. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
3,I would NOT PICK IT AGAIN,"cheap, sturdy, attractive, classic logitech technology...but also a major pain in the ear and head. I have no complaints about the headset's performance, but the silly design pains my ear after twenty minutes of use - leave alone the hours it was supposedly designed for.You would be better off with a conventional over the ears headphone with padding."
3,Normal Performance,"I think it isn't as grate as I thought, because I hear sometimes too much eco when chating on-line."
2,Overhyped product,"This is the second Logitech headset I've bought. Both the headset microphones crashed on me. Now I'm left with 2 worthless pieces. Will invest in a desktop mic and use laptop speakers.In addition, the quality of the cords is very poor.. absolutely flimsy. Logitech has let me down bigtime!"
1,Works well... the first few times,"This headset was great after I bought it... for the first few times I used it! The microphone just quit working :( I don't recommend it as it is pretty cheap.Just as some other reviews state... it does pench your ears, but it's not too bad. It penches a little, but not very noticeable."
3,Hurt my ears,Kinda sharp plastic hurts the tops of my ears where it rests. Almost cutting my ears. Better than any other headset I've tried though. Had complaints about sound quality but that may be the fault of software.
2,CHAT HEADSET = JUST OK,PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME...SO I HAVE ASKED A FRIEND TO CHEKC IT OUT..I WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.
3,"Decent Headset, Slightly low-pickup mic","This is a decent headset. Sound quality is superb. Only quabble with it is that the microphone requires both using the microphone boost, and ventrilo amplification for people to be able to hear my voice decently. Otherwise, a good buy."
5,Great for Skype,"I needed a compact headset that could fit in my laptop case so I could use Skype while on the road. As it relates to my applied use, the headset is comfortable and reception is excellent on both ends."
5,Great all purpose headset,"I got this headset specifially for my softphone (VoIP) that I need at work. I figued it would be good but the audio quality is excellent and the mic is clear. I especially like the fact that it covers both ears (dual mono) for VoIP. In my cramped, loud, hellish office this is a must.I figured I would hook my Samsung YP-MT6Z (which RULES) so I could listen to some Rush, Dream Theater, and Godsmack. The audio quality was great again.I am on calls that last hours. The headset's volume and mic on/off pays here. Click the mic off when you don't need to talk or get a cell phone call.When I travel, have to bundle it tightly so it will fit in my dinky laptop bag (I really need a new one). Even so, it springs back into shape. Very flexible.Solid, good quality, cheap, comfortable, and portable. Easy pick."
4,Great quality and good value,"So far so good, its been a couple of weeks and have had no problems. My only complaint is that the ""foam"" might tend to fall off if the headset isnt treated delicately"
2,Review by neeraj,"Pathatic prodcut,Not expected by Logitech,Very noisy and mic is pathatic. I recommend, do not buy this product."
3,Served me well for 1 year...,"So I didn't buy this when it was on sale, but it was the next best thing to the big bulky models...the only thing I had to say about this that was negatives was:1. The foam pieces for the ear, doesn't last long at all, there was no way it seems to replace them that I know of, what a shame too.2. Not even 20 minutes into a conversation with someone, the headset hurts my ears. I guess it's because it was slightly heavy? I really don't know but then my ears would hurt like crazy to the point where I just give up and put on the speakers and have the mic hanging around my neck.best feature is the Mic mute button with the volume control. My absolute FAVE."
4,"Great for ""typical usage""","This headset is great for someone who just wants to talk via microphone to someone on a messenger service (AIM, MSN, ICQ, Skype, etc) -> as it's designed for just that. I must admit, being a wearer-of-glasses, this product can get a little annoying for the ears - especially if your head isn't ..well, *huge*. I have a pretty big head (24""+) and it's still too small for this headset altogether. It works just fine, perfect and fact.And yeah, you should take the advice of someone below - MAKE SURE TO UNMUTE THE MICROPHONE. =}"
4,very good product for its price,I was amazed at the sound quality for its price. Another 2 very good thing about this is:1) Long cord2) Volume control and Mic mute on the set itself.
4,Reliable - value for money,"I'd rate this as a reliable and easy to use product. It's the second time I've bought it. I gave my first piece to my mom, since she wanted to be able to use it to chat with me on Skype.It's cheap - approx. US$13. It looks pretty cool, and the flexible mic piece is well designed, so you can move it out of the way when you want to use just the headphones.The only disadvantage is that the ear-piece starts to hurt your earlobes if you use it for 2+ hrs.I'd recommend it if you're looking for a cheap and reliable internet chat set."
3,Most uncomfortable headphone,This is the most uncomfortable headphone I ever had. you will get pain over the ear.but still the microphone works good and headphone is ok...
4,Clarity is the best in town,"I own webcam with microphone, speakers and optical mouse... all from Logitech and have no complaints with this one either. Worth an investment as the VOIP is in. Chord length is a bit too long... I guess you could now stand or walk around your room still connected and talking !!! Its crystal clear quality whether be it using SKYPE or Yahoo or GoogleTalk."
2,"Started off good, but not for long.","Being this was a Logitech, (and I have always liked the name), I decided to try it out. For a month or so, I thought they were great but now the right ear peice is dead. So I am in the market now for a new headset, but if you were deciding on these, I would try to steer clear and look for something else."
1,Mic Problem,I have purchased 2 of these headsets. One for me and one for my girlfriend. They both had mic problems. I have not found a replacement but beware there are issues with this headset.
1,Not worth the money,"Logitech 980158-0403 Internet Chat HeadsetI feel very dissapointed about the product. The mic does not pick up your voice the way it shoud, maybe because when you put the headset on the mic is too far from the mouth.One more thing, the headset fits loose. No matter in what possititon you put it, will always feel loose unless you wear a dreadlocks wig.This is the first item I provide a feedback about and I've been buying for quite some time. don't buy this."
2,one Flaw,"This is a confortable chat headset. The micraphone is ajustable and they fit nicley over the ears. The quality of sound is also good. My only complaint is that there is a small rubber bead that connects the plug-in cord to the head phones, if you pull to hard on the cord the wires will become exposed. Usally you can ajust the bead to customize the wire split, but on this set it is merly to cover the connection."
4,"Decent quality, great price","It was cheap, and it works great for skype-ing. I like having the volume control and mute right on the cord because it is easier to adjust quickly. The microphone seems pretty good, the headphones aren't good enough for really listening to music, but are good enough for listening to speech or background music in games. I don't know how they handle bass like in explosions, but I'm guessing pretty poorly. But still, a great deal."
1,Don't buy,"I had and used this headset for 2.5 years. It worked but the foam parts around the mic fell apart fairly soon. Now I finally bought a new no brand headset for $10, and I'm absolutely stunned at the difference in sound quality, particularly the mic. All those two years people had trouble understanding me and I always blamed everything but this headset. Logitech should be ashamed for selling such a low quality item."
1,Logitech 980158-0403 Internet Chat Headset,"I've had this for about a month and when it worked it was great. Not to tight, not to loose and good sound quality BUT just last night the mic on this thing died out of nowhere.One minute working great, next minute hasta la vista. Oh well, my search continues for an internet/ventrillo phone head set that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, goes behind thehead and has decent sound quality."
2,Wouldn't be my first choice,"I used these for about a year. I thought the hanging over the ear design would be cool, but after a couple hours it hurts. The sound isn't great. Definitely not good for gaming, but of course they're not billed as a gaming headset. I much preferLogitech Precision PC Gaming Headset ( 980231-0403 )for gaming and internet chat. Even though the Gaming Headset is rated much lower, I personally find it superior to this set."
5,Does Exactly What it's Supposed To.,"This headset is everything it says and nothing it doesn't say. I think it works really well -great sound for me and I can be clearly heard by people on the other end. No surprises. The cord is pretty long, too, so you can move around quite a bit -or just tie it up a little for neatness."
2,logitech earset,"I used to own a lot of Logitech products. But after this one, I'll probably consider two or three times before I purchase it again. The volume was not that high, and the material isn't that great. but I guess you pay for what you get.. the only nice things was the design of the earset. I can't use the microphone, because I have to shout for the other person on the other line to hear me. does the quality diminish after 2007 or something??"
5,Very Helpful--Contains Explanations I needed,"So far, this includes everything I've needed to look up. For the price it's terrific. If you're starting out with the drums, it's nice to have this as reference material.Explanations are very easy to understand too which inspires me to keep playing. And I love the helpful CD that comes with it!:)I haveDrums For Dummiesas well."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this book so that I could get back into drumming. I already have a kit. This book says it tells you how to drum and stuff but I found it totally useless when it came to me. Maybe its just me but I wish I returned this book. Im letting it collect dust because I think I can teach myself better than this book can. Its filled with tons of irrelevant information.This book is more about buying and selecting drums and tuning them. Not playing them. It is also more about history of drumming. Famous drummers and how to get started. For those of us who cant read music I dont reccommend this book. I didnt even watch the DVD so maybe its worth it IDK just dont go with a seller that promises expedited shipping. My book took 12 days to get to me from Florida. I live in Washington. Dont order this book from Pro-Spin_Books_&_Media It will take forever to get to you and the seller wont help you. Also there will be no tracking device thats useful. Book ships from Florida
4,Very good...but incomplete,"I enjoy using this dictionary, however there it is plagued in incompletenesses. For example, on p.11, the Transliteration Guide is incomplete. Otherwise a pretty good source; wish it included more words."
4,Brings latest arguments in the lit together in one place,"Horst Hendriks-Jansen demonstrates a clear understanding of all the modern arguments about the nature of intelligence and how they relate to each other. He has a clear and logical writing style that explains and debunks many important theories. Although many of these theories and criticisisms have appeared in other places, this book brings them all together and relates them. He describes his theory of interactive emergence and the notion of language as scaffolding for learning. This weaves together many contemporary ideas into a consistient whole. A great deal of the book is devoted to debunking existing theories - I would have liked to see a more detailed exploration of interactive emergence and how language as scaffolding might work. Definitely worth a read, especially if you are interested in clear arguments against symbol-systems hypothesis etc."
5,Relaxing and lovely! Perfect for clients,I'm in love with this DVD! I play it while I do tax returns. While I'm typing in numbers the client can look up and be mesmerized by the goregous underwater scapes and wonderful fish and turtles. It even loops so I never have to mess with it. It also gives gorgeous color to the brown wall. I highly recommend this video.
3,Blu ray? What's that?,"Kinda like a big fish tank. My first BluRay title. It was nice but I don't see all the fuss unless you are comparing it to CRT TV's, then it's WOW!"
1,"I WILL BUY VEST POCKET ""SPIRAL"" BOUND DICTIONARY","I NEED THIS DICTIONARY TO HELP WRITE MY EMAIL FRIENDS, THANK YOU EVERY SO KINDLY."
4,Where's the rest of the concert?,"While this is indeed a good CD, it is only half the concert. The rest of the concert (which I have on the original 10"" LP and a 12"" LP reissue) is even better, even though Hamp is only on the first number--Stardust. However, it is that recording of Stardust that is perhaps the greatest version of the song ever recorded--especially Hamp's solo. But he's paired with such stars as Barney Kessel, Charlie Shavers, Slam Stewart, Willie Smith on alto, etc. (sort of a JATP sound) and the cross-inspiration of the stars is incredible. The other three long tracks are the All-Stars without Hamp, which are just as swinging--if I remember correctly the tracks are Lady Be Good and One O'Clock Jump (I can't remember the last one). Apparently this was issued on CD briefly, but it's out of print. Someone ought to put these two together as a 2-CD set and present the entire concert together--it will be an incredible evening recreated."
1,NO FLOWERS,"Beware. The photo of plant on order page shows large white flowers. There were no flowers on the two plants that were shipped from Amazon. This is unsatisfactory, particularly for an expensive plant."
2,DVD Documentary,This was good if you are looking for the documentary part of the movie. But I didnt keep it. it was a one time watch and I gave it away.
4,To Build A Fire - a short story enacted on film,"The moral of this story made a deep impression on me when I first read it many years ago. It is a clever tale that reminds us to use a little imagination when it comes to the potential consequences of our choices!I read all the reviews before purchasing this story on video, and I agree that this short film is no blockbuster, but it is a good little genre film.My advice is to read the whole story first and if you like it, get it on film* just for fun. Like trying to appreciate opera: it is better to learn the story so you fully understand what is going on.*DVD might be a little sharper image than the video?"
1,To Build a Fire,"""To Build a Fire"" was one of the most boring movies we've ever seen. The movie was drawn out and could have been completed in fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie, the man had a bitter and cocky attitude. He was ungrateful to his only companion, his dog. The dog could have helped him live longer with his nature-like instinct. Although he built a couple of fires, they were not sufficient in temperatures that cold. The dog could have shared its body heat with the man by lying on the man's feet after he fell into the water. But the man's arrogance caused his own death in the end. The dog found his way to camp with his instincts. All and all, we give this ""flick"" two thumbs way down."
2,Up in Flames,"Building a fire under this movie would be beneficial to us all. It followed Jack London's ""To Build a Fire"" well, but showed a poor portrayl of someone in the Yukon. After reliezing the temperature was seventy-five degrees below zero, the man knew it was dangerous to be outside in such cold conditions. Falling through the frozen spring made him relieze taht he needed to build a fire as soon as possible or death would meet hi,. If the man would have paid more attention to his dog's instincts, he may have beateb the blistering weather and survived. All in all, the slow-moving pace made us want to throw the video into the fireplace!"
4,Very informative,"I picked this book to get a better understanding of the symbolism behind Tantra. Initially I was disappointed to see a narrative style of the author's interactions with Vimalananda, but as I read further, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of information packed into this easy to read, narrative style. This book covers a lot of the symbolism and we can expect that a book of this size cannot cover all of it. The esoteric meaning of Ganesha, Krishna and Gopis, Krishna and Shiva and the chapter on esoteric Ramayana are all a delight, but the last chapter on Gurus and Disciples was a bit distasteful in my opinion."
2,boring,"Kind of a boring book, that drags on and on, with out much excitement. Look for the Highlander series by Maya Banks, those books have an erotic mix with English romance, perfect mix!Never Love a Highlander (McCabe Trilogy)"
1,A disappointment.,"Although this is listed for use with notary seals, it does not work. When I called the company - I was told that it will not work on thick paper. It is completely useless to me. Amazon has stood behind it, and has ordered me a new one - sure hope it works better than the first. The one I received is a hand held model - and I'm wondering if the table model would work better. I found customer service at Xstamper to be rude and not helpful."
1,These headphones are lousy!,"I bought a set of these Philips HN100 headphones about a year ago and used them on several long flights. While not the greatest, they worked OK. However, recently they simply broke - a poor design caused a crack in some of the plastic housing and the headphones are now useless. I filed a complaint on the Philips web site and got an email back with a phone number and a case code. When I called them, they seemed only interested in knowing the serial number, and were of no help whatsoever. In fact, the ""help line"" was a throwback to Dilbert.My advice : Avoid these headphones, and anything else made by Philips. My experience with their helpline has sworn me off any and all of their products."
1,Nice sound poor quality constructioin & service,"The sound quality was good, but after a half dozen trips on an airplane the small plastic ear piece holder broke and I could not find service or parts for the unit anywhere. I tride to glue it but the material would not hold."
4,They are not that bad!,"Let's face it. Treat any electronic with kindness... So far they have held-up well.Pros:Highs and lows are there. After reading some of the reviews, I think the lack of bass, or mids, and highs could be an equalizer issue. Nevertheless, I purchased my h-phones on ebay for a mere $1.25 so, I am more than satified with this product. Volume control is nice. Noise reducer (notice that I didn't say eliminator)does more than an adaquate job. Head-set fits nicely on my head. I think as far as long distances are concerned, any brand of head phone will be a nuisence. But, that's my opinion.Cons:They are a tad bit flimsy. And if they do break, good luck on finding replacement parts. I've had my for 7 months now. No breakage. I agree with other reviewers. Handle them gently, no snowboarding with your mp3 player! And they should hold up well."
4,Great for air travel,"I bought these specifically to use on a flight from the east coast to Korea. I picked them up locally at the last minute at a discount electronics shop for $30. For what I paid they did the job. They may not be the same quality as Bose, but then they are less than a 1/4 of the cost. They did reduce 50-70% of the low drone noise that you hear on a plane, enough so that the movies on my laptop were actually enjoyable. I also found that that turning on the noise canceling feature alone (no music, movie, etc) created a much better atmosphere for sleeping. I only fly a couple of times a year and have several other sets of headphones, so I did not want to spend a lot for noise reduction. If you can get them cheap and plan to use them on a plane, buy them."
1,Broken Support Arm,"After using these heaphones lightly for about 6 months, the support arm broke. The noise cancelling does not work all that great either, but I am skeptical that any manufacturer and actually reduce noise all that well (Maybe Bose?). Also, another annoying quality is the volume control/noise cancelling on/off button sits in a horrible place. The only place to put it is in your shirt pocket. Otherwise, the 5 pound brick just hangs from the phones. Buy something else and preferably not from Philips if this product is indicative of their craftsmanship."
2,Too uncomfortable,"I purchased these head phones to accompany my iPod. After wearing it 6 times, it does not accompany anything anymore. They cancel out noise in reasonable manner (you can't expect miracles for this price), but it is so terribly uncomfortable. On my 7 hour flight I started off enjoying its noise-cancelling capabilities, but could not wear it for any longer than 2 hours. They are very tight and literally cause me headaches. It is just such a shame ...If I could only return these headphones and purchase the Sennheiser PXC 250 (they are fab!!)"
2,waste of money,"these headphones produce good sound, but they do NOT work very long. I have had these about 4 months and they just quit one day... I have come to the conclusion after buying 3 pairs of headphones in 1 year that buying expensive headphones is a waste of money."
1,Don't think twice about these....,"Lots of distortion, practically no bass - like another review said, top of headband a bit uncomfortable (no padding), the stage or presence of whatever you're listening too seems far away. Very disappointed."
4,Great book but the price is a few bucks too high,"The art in this book is amazing. It is a must if you are running a campaign in Undermountain. Compared to the few paragraphs written about Skullport in The Undermountain boxed set series this book blew me away. It tells about many NPCs and taverns; it also provides some great pictures to give you the feel of the Underdark. The only problem I have with this book is the price, although it is jammed full of information it still isn't very long, and there are no maps. I think maybe the book would be better priced at $15 instead of $20."
5,Heart Full of Hope Review,I am our Church Librarian and I needed to replace this book in a series. The book is exactly as portrayed and came quickly and in excellent condition.
5,Trust me... Buy it now!,"It's BEE-YU-TEE-FUL. Auer's voice has never sounded sweeter and the songs are gorgeous, lonely, resentful, regretful, loving, and heartbreaking. The last Posies album wasn't quite as enjoyable as their others, so it was a more than pleasant surprise to see that Auer was saving his best songs for this album. ""Josephine"", ""Song Noir"", and ""Six Feet Under"" are the standout tracks for me, but all of the songs are completely engaging and none of them skip worthy."
4,"Almost perfect, but wanting more","Actually I would give it a 4 3/4 stars. Musically beautiful, lyrically touching. My only criticism, many songs seemed too short. I was yearning for more of a melody, or a chorus. Many of the songs are so engaging, and grab you, like the double base outro in Angelita, the beautiful single chorus in Daytime Lullaby, the guitar leads in Josephine. Little touches that have you going back to hear it again. You can hear that there was allot attention to detail given here. I want more!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"This book, in my opinion, was just okay. I was expecting a little more humor. Thought the 'States"" section was a little drawn out."
2,"Funny at First, But it gets Worse.","some parts of this book were pretty hilarious, the last half of the book killed it in my opinion, the 50 states and europeon country facts were mostly very childish, untrue, and just stupid, for example ""the alaska state motto is brrrr..."" there is many false stupid childish facts like this. alot of the europeon facts are just jokes and assumptions making fun of cultures in europe. He claims to have been to some of these locations and obviously he loes about some."
5,Graphics cards for pro 3D apps,"This is in response to Martien Philipse, below, who commented that this card did a lousy job accelerating 3D design software.There's a big difference between cards marketed at gamers -- who do only use a subset of OpenGL -- and cards marketed at professional 3D designers. ATI makes a very good line of professional 3D OpenGL cards -- the FireGL series. They are built for pros, and priced accordingly.You will likely find a professional card such as a FireGL much more suited to your needs. The Radeon 9800 is a very good consumer card, but it's not for everyone."
1,Not really an ATI ORIGINAL,"It is presented as an original ATI RADEON card, when it is really a JETWAY card with the 9800 chipset.Please considered it, you are betting 160 dollars on a chineese product.AMAZON and global computing should make clear what are you buying."
4,Nice card but not as good as the 256MB version.,This card has difficulties playing current video content on the internet. I am assuming it would do better with more memory.
1,"OK for gamers, but avoid for other purposes","By now, it has become painfully clear to me that ATI builds its cards for the gaming market, and little else besides. As you can see above, the gamers are satisfied. However, if, like me, you expect this card to improve the performance of 3d design software - forget it. Ever since installing it, I've seen nothing but trouble. Much of this has to do with the fact that this card poses as an OpenGL-card, but really offers only an approximation of it. As soon as you run applications that demand true an full OpenGL support, prepare for frequent malfunctions and crashes. I actually had to switch the hardware accelareration off in my design programs simply to be able to work with them at all. ATI customer support has also proven to be less than forthcoming and extremely minimalistic. All in all, what a sorry waste of money!"
1,Piece of junk (inject other 4-letter word),"I bought this card hoping it would be better than an ""inferior"" NVIDIA AGP card with less memory. The Radeon 9800 Pro AGP 128 MB was a big disappointment. Compared to the much cheaper NVIDIA card which came with my 1+ year old system, the colors are washed out and there is no noticeable performance improvement while watching DVDs. If you're a gamer, perhaps this card has features that you can appreciate. However, I've managed to find lots of posts on web forums from gamers who have had difficulty making their 9800 Radeon Pro AGP 128 MB cards meet expectations. The possible solutions that are flown in reply are extremely technical and complex and don't seem to work. Unless you're an expert, steer clear of the 9800 Radeon Pro AGP 128 MB."
5,Best for the price.,"This card is very close to the 9800 XT, and not very noticably different from the X800, which was just released. Both of these cards are much more money, and only increase video quality by very little and unnoticable amounts. The 9800 Pro is half the price of all its competitors and just as good in my mind. This card is top shelf now and will be for years to come. It is compatible with every game coming out, and every game that is out now. I now turn up all my quality on all my games to as high as it can go, and I experience no lag. I dont recommend for people who wont be using high end applications and gaming, because those are these cards main purpose. Excellent quality, very reliable."
2,"Good Card, Bad Fan","I bought one of these, was very happy with the performance of the card itself, however, the fan died and by the time the source of the problem was found the card was damaged beyond repair. So, thinking this was a fluke I again bought the same card, but lo and behold the fan died AGAIN, this time I've hopefully caught it before the damage is permanent and have replaced the fan, but I will never buy a Radeon again."
3,"great filter, bad noise","this is a great filter, it keeps my water crystal clear. but there is a ratteling noise like the impellor is loose and i have been sent several replacements but the noise wont go away."
3,Not as great as everyone states!,"Many people stated that the Aquaclears are the power filters to buy and I have two now! They are nice as to the fact that I can change the media around, but definitely does not push the water flow/current strong enough. Also my water is never clear in my tank and I do not have much fishes in my tank. I bought this thinking that the AquaClear 50 would be great for my 29gal but now I have to find another filter to help clear up my tank like how the Aqueons did. Sad but true."
1,worst filter ever,I bought this filter for a turtle tank. It has no power what so ever. To get it to re-prime itself is quite the task. I am unsure if its just to small of a motor or the 3 filters put to much strain on it but I am done after only 2 months. My turtle tank is only 8 gallons it should have been clean yet this filter just isn't strong enough. I bought a underwater filtration from Walmart just so the turtle doesn't die and the improvement in the water was immediate. How dissapointing although it says Power Filter it is not even close.
2,Very loud. Disappointed.,"I really had wished that this filter would be quiet. I had an Aqueon filter previous to this one, wasn't doing that great of a job with a low humming noise which is tolerable as my tank is in my bedroom. I ordered one, followed the instructions, turned it on, and it made a loud rattling noise. It is equivalent to the loudness of someone tapping their fingernails on a table. At first I thought maybe I had installed something wrong, so I went over it again, even had a look at the impeller, still the same issue. So I contacted amazon and they swiftly sent me a replacement, very easy (I love amazon for this). Got the replacement, went over it again, still the same issue except even louder!!I give up AquaClear. I really wanted to like your filter as I like the concept behind the filter ""cartridge"". I give it 2 stars because it does a great job in filtering the water, if you are a light sleeper or get annoyed by sounds easily this filter is not for you."
3,never had a chance to use it,"wish i could have used the 110, was cracked due to poor packing when shipped. had to go to the lfs and all they had was the 70 model. i guess it will have to due for now."
2,Fish Killer,"Hi, I bought this filter for my 40 gal tank and thought it was a really good one based on reviews. Produce information said it was good for tanks up to 70 gal. It does work great but the only problem and the reason I replace it is because even at the lowest setting, it kept sucking the fish onto the extension tube and it kills them. After losing several of my fish, I replaced it with a Nexx like the one I have on my other 40 gal tank. Hence no more dead fish."
1,NOISY !!!,"What are You guys saying ""it's quiet"".It's noisy.Yoy can hear the plastic hrrrrrum from the distance of 12 feet.I checked a lot of filters recently and definitely won't stay with tractor in small package.The media idea compared to cartridge is a plus, but filters in these sizes should be undetecteble by Your ears.C'MON"
1,waste of time,i bought the this item 2 clean my 20 gallon aquarium it doesn't clean d aquarium at all the water still remains dirty an i probably hav dis item about 1 week now an the water level is already falling slower than usual to me i find dis product is a waste of money an the tube that goes into the tank is so short it barely goes into the tank 3 inches properly
5,Great,"I have a 20 gal. saltwater tank, so far has been working perfect. Great price ($25) vs $45 at the local pet store. very quiet, no leaks. No micro bubbles."
4,Not for all,If you have a five gallon tank and a Betta it may not be the best. Even at the slowest setting the current is a little to much for a betta. I did have succes with a sponge where the water pours into the tank. For a ten gallon and above it may be better. It is quiet.
4,good filter. louder than expected,"my old filter wasnt powerful enough. The Aquaclear 30 really keeps my tank clean, but it is a little louder than the old one. Still very quiet, just a slight bubbling noise. I like that this filter is customizable and you can double up on sponges or whatever you want."
5,Best hang on back power filter,"Aquaclear is truly the best hang on back power filter with an affordable price tag. The flow is strong enough and the filter media is adequate. It offers the flexibility to customize the filter media to your own needs. Sponge and biomax are reusable, just rinse them off in the tank water. If you keep the water level high, the filter will restart easily after a power outage. Not a big fan of the clear intake tube, as it encourages algae growth inside, and the intake protection grill could be finer. Overall, the best filter for small tanks within a budget."
5,Unbelievable Difference!,"I have a 55 gallon tank that came with an OEM filter. After watching the ammonia levels in my tank continuing to go up and up after about one week of ownership I decided to search Amazon for a better filter. This filter is by far the coolest thing ever! The tank water is actually filtered through like three layers of filtering agents and apparently the cleaning is very easy and hassle free although I haven't actually done that yet.The filter is aesthetically amazing, it is clear and you can see the water flowing up and through the filter. The best part of all is that my ammonia levels and PH dropped to the PERFECT levels.Very rarely do I feel like I should have paid more for a purchase but in this case I don't think you could pay enough for this filter. Excellent product, excellent value, and I can already tell my fish are notably more active."
1,Motor died,"This was my second aquaclear 110 that I purchased. The first one stopped working out of nowhere but it was used so I decided to buy a new one,bad idea!!! After only about a month the motor just stopped working for no reason. Do not buy this product, put in a few more dollars and get a better one instead of wasting your time and money..I came to realize that it's a really cheaply made product and not reliable at all..while it was working it did a great job but what's the point of wasting $70 if it will last only a month...DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"I read the reviews for this filter before I bought it, that's why I was so disappointed when mine didn't seem to work as well as described. Mine is noisy. I called Aquaclear and they were very nice and sent me a replacement impeller thinking that was the problem. But after replacing it, it was still noisy. I ordered another filter to see if it was just a dud, and the second one did the same thing.As far as function it works very well. Just wish mine was as quiet as everyone else's."
3,Noisy out of box,"Filter looks like it would do an awesome job, But mine was very noisy right out of the box,with lid on it was louder. So I took it apart re- assembled everything to make sure nothing was loose and it was still noisy and pump got a little hot. Sending it back for a refund and going to try another one and see what happens. The shipping was very fast got the item in 2 day's"
4,does the job,"this may not be the most powerful filter in the market but it really does an excellent job. i bought this for a small tank for my fish in my pond so that they can be indoor during the winter. the water is always crystal clear and doesn't stink. just make sure you always clean the foam filter and the propeller of the pump as it always have a lot of waste in it. if you can, make an extension of the pipe down to the bottom as this only includes one extension. you can buy a flexible pipe with the same diameter in your hardware store. the sound created by the waterfall largely depends on the height of the water in the tank. less water in the tank means more splashing sound. i just use the flow control during feeding time so that the food will not be sucked in to the pump other wise it is better to keep it fully open for optimized filtration, ""natural"" waterfall look and sound."
5,OWN TWO ---- WANT MORE,"These filters have kept my tanks vvery clean. Mine are quiet, pump a lot of water, but as a hint, I over filter every tank I have by at least 4 times. For now the filters and carbon are also free shipping"
3,Recent downturn in quality,"I've had 2 of these over the past 10 years and each one still works great, the only issue is that over time the impeller shaft starts to wear causing grinding sounds. It's actually cheaper to just buy a new one, which solves the problem for another five years or so. So again, my filter started making sounds again, no problem, I went online, ordered the product and fired it up. I was shocked that the brand new filter literally right of of the shrink-wrap started making MORE of a grinding noise than the other two! It has been my conclusion that Hagen's (the manufacturer of Aquaclear products) quality has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased over the years. I am just going to return it, get my $50 back and deal with the noise. Please, don't get me wrong, these filters are absolutely amazing. they're one of the best, but a word to Hagen: don't let your quality standards lower or otherwise you'll lose your customer base and reputation."
3,Nice Filter but the Carbon Bags Don't Fit Well,"THe filter is easy to setup and works quietly. From what I have read, this design is better than the ones that have you put in an all-in-one filter. My one complaint is that the bags made for this filter (carbon, ammonia, etc) are realy too big for the filter. They just don't fit properly. You end up having to fold over a fifth of the bag and contents to make it fit into the allocated space. I ended up buying the Aquaclear 30. It allows the bags to lay flat as they were intended."
4,Aqua Clear Power Filter,"This Power Filter does what it says, namely keeps the water clear. My fish are doing fine. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you have to use 3 different mediums for filtration. Of course, that may be why the water is so clear."
4,Very good filter but hard to put together,"I bought this for my 10G tank and so far its far better than the Tetra and aqueon filters. The Aqueon lasted one week till I had to buy a new cartidge and the same thing with the Tetra. The only down fall to this filter is the set up of the cartidges. It has about three, Carbon, sponge and bio. You can buy a fourth that you dont get with the filter its for ammonia. putting all four in a small little space means having to crush them in. Seems to be doing a great job with oxygen too."
4,"good for a 10, small for a 20","i thought this would work on my 20 gallon tank, but i'd really need another alongside to make a difference. otoh, it runs fairly quiet, which is why i trashed the last one - it make a huge racket!"
5,Best price,"Great product, works wonders in the tank. I own a 110 & 70 aquaclear, perfect. Works better than a marineland filter that I paid over $200 dollars for."
5,my tank water was an abomination before i got this aqua clear water filter!,"My aqua clear water filter is the bees knees! I took over a fresh water tank from a friend of mine and thought it was in good condition. However, when I was at his house it was kinda dark so i couldn't really see inside the tank. After getting it back to my house and testing the water I noticed how poor condition my ""new"" tank was in. After only a few hours of having this aqua clear water filter on my tank, I could already see the difference and within a week I had almost completely clear water. If I were you i would get this filter, my tank is a 75 gallon fresh water cichlids tank.It does cost a little bit more to maintain than other filters, but the quality of the water appears to be much greater than the Marineland Penguin Power Filter, 50 to 70-Gallon, 350 GPH.Check out this video, [...]"
1,Hagen: Extremely mediocre packaging skills,"I legitimately think that Hagen does not like to package their shipments correctly. All there was were three tiny little bags of air, they didn't even help fit the box inside snuggly so that it wouldn't get thrown around! My AquaClear 70 was severely cracked and I am getting my replacement. It's a great company, but they should learn not to skimp on the safety of their shipment to customers."
1,Great filter except for,"yea, great filter except that it does not retain suction very well. When the power goes off and comes back on and the water in your tank is a little low, it must be primed again. Next problem was somehow the filter guts floated up and because I did not cut the bio bag excess. The bag came out and acted as a wick then 6 gallons later (under my new hardwood floors) I realized what was happening.On the positive side, I think the filters are extrememly quiet. The reviewers who says they are noisy have never had a noisy filter."
3,nice LITTLE filter,"little overpriced for the size... filter is great and all does its job but i wish they had been more specific about how small it actually is... cup your hands together and thats the size of it. also comes with white pellet looking things that will not work with filter system. manual shows the pellets in a ""net bag"" that will prevent them from escaping, and both filters that I got came with the pellets in a plastic bag.... so unless I stuff them in the bottom of the filter aint gonna work."
5,Great,"Product works great, love them... tank is crystal clear, and is quiet as any filter i have ever had. Totally recommend for anybody in this hobby"
3,Way to loud but good system.,Great filter except for the fact that its soo loud. You will have to take off the cover on top to lower the sound a bit. I emailed the company and they believe it may be the propeller problem. I hope they are right. Have to get another as soon as possible.
5,Good filter.,I have to say this filter is really quiet. You wont notice its there. It has a lot of media and simple design. It also slimmer than most filters.
3,This is an o.k. pump,"This is the second pump of this kind I had bought for my fish tank. It says that it is made for a tank up to 50 gallons, but I think that I would likely use it on a 20 gallon tank. The pump isn't strong enough for my liking and after awhile the filter material starts to push on the top of the filter (actually lifts up) and comes out. I thought that it was a fluke with the first filter I bought, but now I know it is the norm."
4,Keeps my fish tank clean!,"My old filter broke so i bought this one to replace it, its kinda noisy but i think that's because i plugged it in without having water in it. Otherwise its a great filter and keeps my fish tank water very clear and clean."
1,I really wanted to like it...,"The reviews were good, it was highly recommended, I really wanted to like it. Out of the box the motor was a little loud, but it is a motor after all so you would expect some noise. I had the impeller out a couple of times to make sure it was aligned correctly. I decided that the motor hum was not a big deal. Then the lid rattled when I put it on all the way. Fine, I would just put it on in such a way that it won't rattle. Or, duct tape the edges that rattled. I decided I could deal with rattle somehow and that was okay, too. Then the water noise started. I like a silent running tank and this one was splashing water a lot more than I wanted. If I turned the flow all the way down it was better, but I got this filter because I wanted 200 gph, so turning down the flow was counterproductive. There was no way to get 200 gph without water noise. I finally gave in and decided this filter was not going to work for me and sent it back."
2,cheap plastic,I received this unit with the tank cracked at the bottom of the tank. The plastic just seems to be that easily crack stuff. I bought a penguin 200 instead and it turned out to be that black durable plastic and the filter works great.
5,Aqua Clear is the best filter to use,I have always used Aqua Clear for all of my serious fish tanks. I only have a 40 gallon tank but I bought the big filter to help clean my tank. My tank right now is super clear with this filter. I only change my water once a month at the most and it always looks clear! The price isn't bad and it's the best quality filter I've seen out there.
3,good for the money,I bought this filter for a 29 gallon tank that was laying dormant for many years. It works well; however; the Wisper 600 it was replacing was an infinitely better design. The vertical stacking of the filter medium means that all maintenance and media changes usually have to be done by taking it off the tank as opposed to the Whisper design where the media fits in a groove in the box seperating the filtered and unfiltered sections and can be removed and replaced without removing the filter from the tank. The design of the intake tube is also annoying; the slotted end (to prevent the fish from getting sucked up) is integrated into the lift tube both on the primary tube and the extension. This impedes water movement somewhat.For the price ($26 with shipping) it's the most filter power for the money. For better design and sturdier construction I would recommend Second Nature's Whisper line at a considerable higher cost.
3,Expected better for such high ratings,"Although this model may be good in terms of dependability and cleaning efficiency, it is not quiet nor is it user-friendly in terms of maintenance. The old Whisper it was supposed to replace is better on both fronts. The pump on the AquaClear 70 could be quieter, and the water falls almost a couple of inches in the air before hitting the water-- and yes, the tank is full to half-inch from the top. I guess it was designed this way to promote aeration of the water, but it is noisy."
2,Noisy,"I purchased this filter for my 80 gallon Cichlid tank. I have had both Marineland Penguin and Hagen Fluval filter canister. I decided to replace the Marineland and after researching online, I decided to go with the Aquaclear 500. The quality of water has definitely improved and it became crystal clear. The one thing I can't stand, though, is how noisy this device is!! I don't mind some 'white' noise, but this thing sounds like someone is drilling next to me! I have to turn it off every night when I sit in the living room or else I feel like my head is going to explode! I sure wish it's not bothering the fish as much as it's bothering me."
1,Dont Order AquaClear 110,"The filter case is acrylic and damages too easily compared to a plastic resign filter case. Amazon tried to replace the product, which I am greatful for, but the product is not robust enough to last."
1,Mine doesn't even work!,"I bought mine about two months ago and have just unboxed it to use on a new tank. I primed it and all before turning it on, and the actual motor had a funny sound then stopped completely. The motor was boiling hot!I love aquaclear filters, but I am very disappointed with what has happened. I bought this after using an aquaclear 70 so I could get one for my betta tank."
2,Would not suggest,"I bought this item because the reviews seemed okay on it. There are so many filters, it can be hard to decide on which one to buy. I received this filter and liked the way it looked. It was not to loud and thought I was going to be happy with it. Three days after set up.. leaking. Soaked my floor since I did not notice it till the next morning. I set it up exactly how the instuctions told me (yes I actually read the instrictions). Returned it and purchased the penguin 200. So far liking it a lot!"
2,aquiacleer 110 power filter,"this power filter does a good job of filtering water but is verry noisey pump is loud and the water coming out of it souinds like a rushing river i replaced it with a aquiatop 400uv it is verry quiet like it states and does a great job of filtering my overstocked 55gal tank worth every penny, dont waste your money on the aquiaclear."
1,DOESN'T FIT MY TANK,"OK, DOESN'T FIT MY TANK AND THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP! SUPER MAD ABOUT IT TOO. THE FILTER JUST 'DOES NOT FIT OVER THE EDGE OF MY TANK!"
5,one of the best,"I have used other filters before and nothing compares to the aquaclear! Superb water quality and clarity, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Some damage on the filters,"Both filters had a crack on the right side on the same place, no sings of damage on the box so i asume it was a factory disperfect, easy to fix but tastelessness, after that everithing else was fine."
2,Disappointed,This is a quiet filter as advertised. I thought it worked well when it did work...after 4 months it died. I wouldn't buy one again.
1,Very Pour Filter system,"I have had this filter running for about three weeks now, Ever sense that second day of using the filter my tank has been cloudy. The filter is quiet but it is worthless if it does not clean the water properly. My old filter system has been in the tank less than two hours and the water has already cleared up. I would by no means by this product again or recommend it to anyone. I would love to have my money back and my fish I'm sure would love to have that two weeks of dirty water back."
1,Came with cracked filter box,I haven't had a chance to really use and evaluate the product yet as it has arrived with the filter box's upper front right corner cracked. So my rating is for poor shipping quality. I returned it for replacement. It is pretty frustrating not being able to use the product when it arrives because of such a defect. I will wait and see what will happen with the replacement and with Amazon's sensitivity to customer satisfaction...
4,"Little noisy, but great","Works great, but it is a tad noisier than other HOB filters. I suppose I can't complain though about the noise to much with how well this thing filters... it's super amazing... DO NOT use with fish that don't like current though as this thing will put out quite the current. I had it in a 29 gallon tank and it worked wonders."
5,"Works Great, and very customizable!","The filter works great, it has excellent flow and is very quiet. I especially like that since it does not use ""cartridges"" you can easily customize the filter media to your liking."
2,"Good filter, but LOUD","I had previously used the Aquaclear Filter in a 10 gallon and it was quiet and did really well. When I upgraded my tank, I decided to upgrade to the Aquaclear 70. The moment I pluged it in I knew that I would have problems...it was very loud and the rattle was beyond what the Aquaclear 30 was.I did some research and found out that it was an impeller issue, made worse by the hard plastic casing/cover. I tried Vaseline (a fix found online), I replaced the motor with my old 30 motor (they are interchangeable), and finally I ordered a new impeller. The new impeller even had problems and is still very loud (I have the aquarium in my bedroom and it is difficult to sleep)I have ordered a Fluval 406 to replace the 70 currently on my tank and plan to throw the 70 away. Very disappointed and expensive problems make for a decent filter, but a very loud one...Two stars for the filter but can't go higher because of the problems."
5,Aquaclear 110,"I have been very impressed with this filter, having purchased other filters before, this has been my favorite. It is very quiet, the motor never jams up, and the regular maintenance is very reasonable."
3,"Not Bad, Until It Broke....","I had this product line for years so I know its a good design for the price. I ordered this as a third filter for my freshwater tank, not really needed but I wanted a bit more flow in a 'dead' space in my tank. It ran great for the first week then I noticed the pump motor grinding. I took it apart and cleaned out any junk that may of been caught in the pump. All looked good and clean. Put back together and ran for a few more hours until it started grinding again then it just quit running all together. Again, took apart, very clean, no cracks in the magnet, housing looked fine. Spun freely by hand but under it's own power, nothing. Like I said, I like the design but the pump might need some attention as it's the week link... Sending back for a refund.."
5,The Best Hang-On-Back Aquarium Filter,"The AquaClear 110 is the best hang-on-back aquarium filter on the market. It is extremely reliable, very quiet, easily customizable, and really powerful. I've used an older version of this filter for 20+ years, and recently picked up another one. I've owned dozens of hang-on-back filters, and there isn't one that has come close to being as good in as many categories as the AquaClear 110. Don't waste your time with alternatives, spend the extra few dollars and get this filter.-TBM"
3,Does the job but VERY loud,"I needed to upgrade to a larger power filter (I upgraded to a larger aquarium). I was using the Aquaclear 50. The Aquaclear 50 did a great job and it was very quiet. The Aquaclear 70 does a great job too, but it is very loud. Almost too loud. I can take the lid off and it helps, but the noise is coming from the filter motor. It is not a vibration noise. I already exchanged it for another one because I thought the loudness was a defect. I was wrong. If you have your aquarium in a family room where you spend alot of time, this power filter is too loud."
5,Keeps my 10 gallon tank crystal clear for a month.,I got this filter for a 10 gallon tank because I was having trouble keeping it clear with the cheap filter that came as part of an aquarium starter kit. It has worked great and has an attractive design. I can easily wait a month or so to change out the water and it still looks very clear. I have 2 medium sized fancy goldfish in the tank. It is also quieter than other filters I have had in the past. I have had the product for 3 months now and it works as well as when I first got it.
3,Filter for RES,"This filter arrived on time and works very well. I have a RES and this is all I need to keep the tank clean. Only giving it three stars because the plastic was chipped and broken in a few places, but not so much to where it couldn't be used."
3,Nothing Special,"I have a 30 gallon hex. This filter did not hang properly on the side. I could make it work. It was secure and leveled. But it put strain on the casing to the point that the lid didn't fit flush. It's also very noisy. I read the reviews stating that it was a bit loud, but I thought they were probably exaggerating. Nope. I can hear it two rooms away. Sending this one back and ordering a canister filter. It's twice the price...but you get what you pay for I guess."
4,Good Pump,"This pump is rated for a 50 gal tank, I have a 36 gallon freshwater fish tank. It works very well. Came with a two suction tubes, but I had to purchase another tube to reach the bottom of my tank. The instructions tell you that you can slow the flow rate by moving the suction tube to the right or to the left, I find this questionable as I have seen no difference. This is a good product over all I recommend it."
3,works well,I use this in conjunction with another filter and the two of them are wonderful in keeping my tank clean and clear. I have a 20 gallon tank and think that I should have gotten a 50 gallon filter since turtles tanks are so hard to keep clean and clear without hard work.
5,Best Filter for its price,"very good at doing its job, keeps my water clean and clear.very quiet, don't really hear much at all. Would be quieter if you don't close the lid completely, just move the lid a little to the side and noise will decrease."
5,Perfect filter!,"I received this filter when I acquired a 125 gallon freshwater tank. They had two on the system.I purchased new carbon bags and rinsed the filters and sponges and it is the BEST filter I have ever had, and that's a lot of filters.I usually use biowheels, which are wonderful but they are splashy and loud. The Aquaclears are not loud plus have an adjustable flow which is a HUGE benefit alone.They are perfect as you can add media just like you could a canister filter, as it has a media basket instead of cartridges. It's really brilliant!I will certainly be purchasing the smaller versions for my future tanks, the rest are set up w/ biowheels. My hospital tank will be sporting a new aquaclear very soon as it's in the bedroom and these filters are very quiet.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"
4,Great reliable filter,"Hagen AquaClear 20 Aquarium Power FilterI use this filter on my 10g planted tank and an Aqua Clear 30 on my 10g Shrimparium. These filters have a standard tube intake and waterfall outflow. They are quiet and efficient; however if you like the sound of falling water, reducing the water level in your aquarium slightly will produce a small waterfall. They have the ability to control water flow by moving the intake U-tube right or left in the receiving slot. I find them easy to clean. They can easily receive a DIYCO2 line with no modification. Triple filtration; nice foam block on the bottom, charcoal bag in the middle and ammo media I think, on the top. I use bio-tubes instead. The charcoal bag can also be replaced with bio-tubes. Great product."
3,Incorrect specs on Amazon,"I bought this due (in part) to the +/- 1% accuracy as listed on Amazon, but when I received it thebox said +/- 2%. This is not any better than many of the other low end models. So now I haveto decide if it's worth the hassle of returning it to save $15-$20."
1,Broken,I received the first of these and the laser pointer was not working. I exchanged it for a second of the same model and that also had a non-working laser pointer. I returned it and purchased the 52224A model instead and have had no problems.Atleast the return process was quick and painless.
1,becareful when buy from place k seller,I bought a Dual Temp Infrared Thermometer from place-k and it said NEW. When i got it . it doesn't have a instruction book and no laser point target when pull trigger. It's look like am having a defective part. I got it from a seller frank dull from hebron OH. Now how i can get a replacement or get my money back.....Ben from ATL Georgia
2,disappointed,"I'm disappointed. I bought these containers two different times last year and twice the small container has broken cover, simply does not fit well and eventually breaks. Medium and large containers have remained perfectly but the small is a hassle"
2,Cheap,"Not what I was expecting, lids are solid so you can't see what's in them and there to small even the large one. Will not hold a whole bag of flower, these look more like chrome than stainless steel."
4,Great Container,"These containers are exactly as described. Very sturdy stainless steel design including stainless steel lids. Great for food grade uses. The lids seel fairly tightly, but are NOT air tight."
5,Everything You Wanted To Know About Beechcraft Airplanes,I let a friednd borrow my original and never got it back. I missed this book so much I ordered two more to make sure I will always have this invaluable source of Beech aircraft.
3,TOO FEW SONGS!!!!!,"I HAVE LOOKED HIGH AND LOW FOR SOME OLD DOUG E. FRESH STUFF ON CD AND THIS WOULD BE GOOD EXCEPT THERE IS HARDLY ANY MUSIC. WHAT ABOUT ""SHE WAS THE TYPE OF A GIRL""? WHAT ABOUT ""LEAVE IT UP TO THE CUT PROFESSOR""? THAT TAPE THAT CONTAINED ""THE SHOW"" AND OTHERS WAS A GREAT TAPE BUT I CANT FIND IT ON CD!!!!! I NEED IT IF THERE ARE MORE SONGS ON IT WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT IT WILL BE BETTER."
5,"FANS, FANS, FANS, FANS, FANS, FANS!",He was part of one the greatest rap group ever. This is Hip-Hop at it best. WHERE IS THE REISSUE? WHERE IS THE REISSUE? WHERE IS THE REISSUE?

3,need to have,"Me and a friend are looking for this one. It does need more hits but i'd still buy it. It's classic like MC Shan's ""Down By Law"" and Just Ice's ""Latoya"". Where are they? i'm an avid collector and they need to be in my possession."
3,Old Doug E albums,"This album would be nice if it included a few more hits.... I'm desperate to find ""Oh, my God"" and ""World's Greatest Entertainer"" on CD, MiniDisc, Tape (if in good condition), or LP (if in good condition)... If anyone knows how to get these items, please email me...dj_unEq@usa.netOr call 410-419-8000 Thanks :)"
3,keep rising to the top is a great song,"don't know any of the other tunes, so that's why it only has three star"
3,WHERE'S THE BEEF?!,We all know that Doug E. is the man. We need to hear more songs to make this CD viable! Is this the extended version of La-Di-Da-Di? Where is the song with Little Vicious? MORE SONGS = SELL MORE....
2,can't believe that's it!!!,"I can't believe that with all of the hits,this is all that's being released.Forget the ""HITS"",what about all of the album cuts like""PLAY THIS ONLY AT NIGHT""???These were the songs that made him so loved and respected,I hope these disappointments will reach those that can do something about it."
5,'give not your heart to idols! I have sacrificed everything to an inordinate love',"Exquisite read telling the life of John Barnard, a stern and righteous Norfolk businessman in the early Victorian years. Stuck in an unloving marriage with a wife becoming increasingly dependent on madeira; bereft after losing five children in infancy; disappointed in his eldest son who was sent down from Cambridge then emigrated; and in his daughters, spinsterish Euphemia and Ellen, disfigured by a birthmark- he gives all his love to remaining daughter Mary. But he is unable torecognise her intrinsic selfishness and shallowness..."
1,complete and total failure,"this book was supposed to be helpful for database administrators. however, i am not quite sure who could use it. it would probably be better for a dba in the long run if he would not buy this book. it will only waste his / her time. i personally had to take this book right back to the retailer."
1,wonder book,"this really is a wonder book. nothing more, nothing less. complete waste of readers' time, and money. another failure from new riders."
1,completely useless,"wow... i thought i had read in one of the reviews that this book was great. whoever wrote either hasn't read the book or doesn't know anything about administering dbs. whatever you do, do not buy this book."
1,No Vision,"When Gregg's first book came out, she was a poet I found promising. In my opinion though, Gregg hasn't lived up to that promise at all. Her work at best fizzles and fails to reach its mark, and at worst insults the reader's intelligence with it vapid, self-centered pronouncements.One thing I cannot get away from as I read these poems is simply how false they all sound. In poem after poem, the poet seems to desperately try to be something she is not. Imitation for the sake of learning is fine, but at some point one expects a poet to find and have the courage follow her own voice. This particular book has gotten a number of bad reviews, and one can see why.It is really too bad because I think Gregg's early work showed some talent. Judging by this collection, it just never took root or gained substance. One wishes for and expects better."
1,"Not meritless, but also not very good","If Gregg were a personal friend, I would of course applaud her. She is not completely without talent and there are some nice poems in this book, though I think most would agree that her best are to be found in her first book. But I am not her friend, I am a poet: and as a reader I have to say she is just not in the same league as poets such as C.D. Wright, Lucie Brock-Broido, or Carolyn Forche, or any one of a number of newer fresher voices who have recently published. She never discovered anything. She never broke new ground. She is a poet who has always promised much, but delivered little. This book is hands down her most mediocre. It suffers from aesthetic laziness, from default thinking and repetition, and I would say a lifelong lack of courage. Sad because she really is a ""could have been""."
3,This is a maintenance manual!,"It's a great book but be warned. When I baught it I thought it was a book ABOUT those models. What it is is a typical Clymer Service, Repair, and Maintenance book. This was not clear to me since they didn't include the sub-title."
4,BMW R-Series 1970-1994,"A very informative workshop manual. A must if you are doing your own work. It's well illustrated and easily understood. The only improvement it needs is a better index. The index it has now is not comprehensive and ,therefore hard to find specific listings without actually having to go through the chapters themselves. It would be a 5 star with a separate index for each chapter."
2,short changed,"While I love the Dog Whisperer....owning Seasons 1-4 on DVD, also. Each of those sets included 5-6 discs of viewing. Not so with Season 5... there are only 3 discs. I feel a bit short-changed."
3,Love The Dog Whisperer....,"We have all of his seasons shows, and love them all. I was sorry to see that they broke this season up into two discs... kind of greedy of them, but we bought them both anyway. I hope Cesar pressures them into not pulling that stuff again. It will lose him loyal buyers."
5,Helps you get into the mind of your dog,"I have this plus all the other seasons of the Dog Whisperer. I have learned so much from these videos. Of course, every dog is different, so you can't use the same techniques on every dog. I've taught my little dog to heel at my side and not pull on the leash with these techniques. It takes time. But it does work. You just have to make sure that your intensity is the same as the dog's intensity. Trying to coerce a dog who is super excited using gentle techniques is not going to work. Likewise, being too forceful with a timid dog is most likely going to wreck the dog. Watching these videos has helped me to become a better observer of my dog to see what his intensity level is so I can match it better so that he understands the point with just one word from me."
5,"works good, better than hook and loop","This is a nice upgrade to the velcroe pads. Sands better since there isn't the velcroe ""cushion"" between the paper and the backer. In general the sticky back sand paper is also cheaper, and the sticky never runs out, where as the velcroe does... The only downfall is if you are changing from one grit to another and back to the original, you cannot reuse sticky back paper, whereas with velcroe you can save your paper for another day..."
4,Good read,"I am not a fantasy reader, but I read this book because the author is a good friend of mine. I was pleasantly surprised--not because I doubted the author's writing ability as he is very capable, but because I liked it. It was a fantasy novel and I actually enjoyed it. I am a practical person and I usually read more nonfiction books.Also, I liked the way the author put this fantasy story in a contemporary context. I felt I could relate to the character's internal struggle. I loved the author's vivid descriptions. The action and storyline compelled me, and I had a hardtime putting the book down."
5,"FJ Fury ""In Action""","I really enjoy the ""In Action"" series, as they are an easy read and profusely illustrated with many black and white photos, and several line drawings. The front and rear covers are wonderfully illustrated by Don Greer. This book covers the life of the Fury from inception all the way through to the FJ-4B. The ""Centerfold"" is colorfully illustrated with Fury's from the FJ-1 to the FJ-4B. Built by North American Aviation (Who gave us tha fabulous P-51 and equally fabulous F-86), the Fury did have it's share of ""Teething problems."" Although experience with the F-86 was invaluable, producing a fighter for the Navy presented it's own problems; i.e. slower landing speeds, more stress on the airframe and landing gear, etc. To say that the Fury was just a ""Navalized"" F-86 Sabre is wrong. The FJ-4 and -4B were completely redesigned - although you can see the Sabre's lineage in the Fury. This book will be a great assistance to anyone who is modeling the Fury's currently on the market."
3,where is siouxsie?,"Where is the great ""Halloween"" by the even greater ""Siouxsie and the Banshees"" that plays during the closing credits?"
4,Great music yet lacking passion...,I'll admit the only reason I ran out of the theater to buy this CD was not because of all the music in the movie. All I really was interested in was the opening titles and eliza's song. I was really impressed with those tracks and had to have them in my collection of music. After listening to those I was a little unimpressed with the rest of the album but over time it grew on me. Now I consider it my favorite soundtrack for 2006. Its a well rounded musical journey. With lots of splashes.
4,Curry Powder,"I found the curry powder to be very good. I wish there could be a bit less cinnamon. The price because of the large quantity, was much better than those little bottles at the grocery stores."
5,p funk is back,john hickey is a member of bernie worrell's woo warriors and played with george clinton and bootsy also so john went to the school of funk smoking cd if you like the weird funkadelic guitar riffs p funk is known for you might be intop this too bernie and greg fitz play on here as do all the woo warriors a must have dfor p funk fans.
3,Iworship U,Amazon needs to list the songs on the DVD or CD. You don't know what songs you are purchasing and you may already have it. Not good!
3,made in china,"Just bought one of these from Lowe's today. After purchasing and removing the label I saw on the inside of the label that it is made in China. I looked all over the square and the label prior to buying to see where it was made and could not find anything. I do not like the obvious effort by Swanson to hide the country of origin. Besides that, the square is OK."
4,Took YEARS off of my serving bowls!,No caustic smell and did a great job of cleaning my years-of-tarnish bowls. I can proudly serve in the bowls again and they are beautiful!
5,Tarnish Be Gone,Had to polish the silver for Thanksgiving and Maas worked more effectively than any other brand I've used. It took off the stubborn stains that developed on my older serving pieces with relative ease. I find I also use less of it than the other polishes on the market. Highly recommended.
3,doesn't live up to the ads,Maas is okay. It cleaned the sink and gave a soft sheen but I had to work very hard to get that mild effect. The sink does not look super shiny or new by any means. Maas didn't work any magic when I tried it.
1,Disappointment & a Fibromyalgia Attack,"Back in March or April I ordered the Maas Metal Polish from their own site (I think? - not sure. I had read something about it in a magazine or on the Internet. We were going to Yellowstone for a month and I could hardly wait to tackle cleaning all the glass and metal inside and out, with this 'easy to use product'. Well, it was not easy! I barely made a small hole in the scum on the glass shower doors, and didn't even make it thru to the glass. Trying to prove to my husband how wonderful it was and I just put myself in a terrifically bad Fibromyalgia attack with pain for days. My hubby tried it on the glass and on metal and said that it worked slightly, but was not worth the terrible hard rubbing it took."
3,Must be different formula,"I bought a little tube of MAAS polishing creme about 16 years ago that I still have -- somewhere. It works great! Of course, when I needed it, I couldn't find it. So when I found this 1 lb. can here at Amazon, I had to buy it. Well, first off, it reeks of ammonia (the old stuff didn't have much of a smell). The old tube of MAAS had a clay-like, slightly gritty texture. And it worked rather quickly, even on steel. The new stuff is purple and very creamy. The real downside is that it takes a bit of elbow grease to see any results. I guess I'm going to have try it with the Dremel."
3,Decent job,"I polished everything I have with MAAS - sterling silver, silverplate flatware and candelabra, brass candlesticks, stainless sinks, cabinet knobs, pewter light fixtures, etc. It took a bit of elbow grease, but everything polished up well. I was a bit disappointed that the shine on the candelabra (the most difficult piece I have to polish) did not hold up very long - perhaps it's user error in that I did not dust it often enough since Thanksgiving, but it must be re-polished now. MAAS did a decent job and it's nice to only use one product on all items rather than switching from silver polish to brass polish to stainless polish. I just know that in my next life I will not own anything that needs to be polished."
5,lasting shine,"I used Maas to shine the cooper stove top and pipe and it was easy and the shine has lasted. Other products that I tried were harder to use, and tarnished within a week. I love the Maas, it is well worth the money."
4,almost great,"I was hoping for a quick fix, this is a VERY tarnished brass bed, still have to use elbow greas but it eventually does the job well"
1,A big abuse of paper maybe,Basically it's the result of someone so lost in their life that they needed a new form of attention. Why I bought this is beyond me. I was doing research on cult experiences and the only thing I got out of this is that the writer seems like a permanent little girl. It's like Harry Potter meets Helen Keller. Save your money!
2,Return them direclty,I do not think they are made of leather. Return them directly after receiving them.
2,Useless Dish Rack,"I bought the dish rack for my mother's remodeled kitchen, but it was too big and I had to throw it away. It reminded me of an old milk crate for some reason."
5,AWESOME!,"The first edition of this book was great, but the new 2nd edition is AMAZING! There's more photos, a new price guide and updated information from the first version. The photographs are really beautiful and fun to look at, and it's very helpful to have all the pieces of an outfit pictured and described with their assigned rarity. This book has been really helpful to me in piecing together outfits and figuring out some variations as well."
5,A must-have for all Skipper doll collectors!,"Very well done; beautiful pictures and accurate description, as far as I can judge (I'm not a Skipper doll collector; I just have some in my Barbie collection!)By the way, it stops at the early 70s.I wonder if the Authors are going to publish something on the later Skipper dolls..."
5,The perfect reference !,I learned many things I didn't know about Skipper and her frineds. Nice pics. A joy to read...just like flying back in time to the groovy 60's :)
5,Beautiful Watch,"I have owned the Disney Minnie Mouse version of this watch since January 2009 and have not taken it off since. It is comfortable with a nice thin profile and easy to read. I find myself admiring it as the light catches the diamonds and dances off the crystal. This is my fourth Wittnauer and by far my favorite as it lends itself easily to both casual and dressy occassions. Oh and yes, as with all Wittnauer watches it keeps excellant time"
5,Every believer Must Read,Don't be so deep that you can't take practical advice. This is what this book offers with a marriage of Gods desire for us to live healthy lives and how to do so in the natural! Easy read and a classic!
5,Cedar - Tree of Life is a labor of love & beauty!,"The Northwest Coastal people held the cedar & its spirit in high regard for all the gifts of life it offered them. For millennia they developed tools & skills to fell the giant trees to make canoes, post-&-beam homes, waterproof boxes & carved poles. Dedicated to those who know & respect the spirit of the Cedar, Hilary Stewart's book is a labor of love, respect & infinite knowledge. It intrigued her that people lived so well & for so long using almost exclusively the materials of their environment & her curiosity has wrought a fine book of early illustrations. A must for anyone interested in how the First People lived."
1,Done by a true beginner !!!,"Highly recommended for individuals and corporations trying to learn how to change colors, move and drag windows while having Avid Xpress open in the background. It is a complete waste of your money."
2,Save Your Money - Just Think!,"You really don't need this book. Yes, there may be a few interesting ideas here and there but perhaps, it would be suffice to have a list of 50 to get you started thinking how to pamper yourself and then you can think of better ways yourself. Okay, if you need some excuses (like ""oh, the book said it will be good if I pamper myself this way""), go get the book. Otherwise, save the money and buy yourself a real treat."
1,This might have been decent in 1999...,"I ordered this book as a gift, and if anything, it's only good for a few laughs... I did not notice the publishing date until the person who I gave this book to pointed it out, and it's a little out of date. For example, one of the ways to pamper yourself was to ""get a cell phone"". I'm sure there are more up-to-date forms of this book, so don't waste your money."
5,Music to put a smile on your face,"Don't let the cover picture mislead you. These are not rank amateurs getting together after one too many. Excellent musicianship and very professional!! The music is great feel-good stuff that is familiar to most players of wind instruments (George Cohen and other works with traditional American sound). Sad that our rich musical heritage (band music, jazz) is overlooked by so many. This group is a reminder of how rich it is-I can't recommend this recording enough."
5,"Nurturing, reassuring, and hopeful","This book doesn't leave a stone unturned in finding all paths from all backgrounds and all schools of thought in our eternal search for inner peace and happiness. Great book. Also recommended, The Little Guide To Happiness. Another book that brings us closer to the prize."
1,Ho hum!,I thought this book might be different from the rest of the books I've read on being joyful in the best and worst of times. It wasn't new and had nothing to offer of interest. I don't know what the shouting is about over this book or its author. BORING!
5,Poisons are fascinating,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it is fascinating if you read it objectively because it is well balanced and well referenced and documented. It contains lots of interesting nuggets of information and these crop up all the way through. It shows that all chemicals are potentially poisonous but most can be safely used if used properly. So the book counters some of the doom sayers and scare stories and sets the record straight on things like DDT. Timbrell points out that the risks have to be weighed against the benefits (as with DDT and drugs).I found it a thought provoking book and readable.
3,Something to read while you're reading something else.,"This book was not as interesting as I thought it would be. I found it a bit dry at times. Subsequently, it is a book I read whilst reading other, more engaging publications. Having said that, it is well researched and some of the background information was quite interesting. In a number of instances, the author chose a particular poison/drug in a particular class and discussed it as a representitive of that class. I think the reson for this, at least in part, was to keep the book to a manageable size."
5,Great Book,"I grew up with the leader of the incursion and I don't think any of this has had ""literary license"". In High School, Dev was a wrestler and fierce competitor. He was consistantly demonstrating his leadership abilities. It was in his blood. His Dad and Brother were leaders as well. This book does him justice. He has been and will be missed by all that knew him."
2,Avg at best,Book jumps all over the place and is very hard to follow. There are alot better books on the same subject out there.
3,LRRP's IN CAMBODIA,"A great story about the fateful mission of a LRRP team. While I enjoyed reading about the story the book drags along when the author takes leave of telling the details of the mission and subsequent rescue by the Apache Troop, and gives you related information about the soldiers (kinda like developing their character or setting the table).Understanding the need to make the entire mission and rescue story sufficient length to put into a book that would sell... it makes sense.Reading about the mission and rescue is gripping.As someone who has read about 18 Vietnam War books, some by this author and others, I rate the book overall an average read, but the account of the mission and rescue are very good."
2,"Les Miserables, anime version.","This is a book I wanted to like, but the more I read, the faster I read, just to be done with it. It struck me as Les Mis, done in anime. The various faces of Julian are stark and narrowly drawn, with so little transition between faces and little insight into his being that one can scarcely reconcile one image with the other, let alone see some internal transition toward repentance. The narrator was little more than a cardboard cutout propped up by a few cursory claims of faith.Still, Wangerin's talent pops out sporadically, enough that I'd try another book of his. But with this one, I was left with the feeling that Wangerin simply did not take the time to write as he seems capable of writing."
2,Lifeless and somewhat rote,"Wangerin's effort here seems lifeless and somewhat stock. It's hard to think that such a potentially captivating story could be made to sound bland, but it does come together that way. There are a few moments when we see into Julian's character, but his motivations are always lost and his faith seems second-hand to doing the right thing. This book is altogether lost in the facts and historical elements of the story rather than the human element. Try ""Godric"" by Beuchner or ""Patrick"" by Stephen Lawhead for an altogether different experience of saints and their passionate histories."
3,F&I War With Washington at the front,"When the Forest Ran Red gives a look at the spark that started the French & Indian (aka 7 years war) between England & France. Filming was done well, reenactors filled the role very well and the overall scenery was outstanding. Affording a new or more extended view on George Washington and Braddock's Defeat near modern day Pittsburgh showing the old world vs new world fighting tactics that lead to the defeat of Braddock.Interesting side note around the fact that several future great ""personalities"" were at the Battle, these included Horatio Gates, Daniel Boone, Dan Morgan and Thomas Gage in addition to Washington.Minuses: The character that portrayed Washington just did not fill the bill."
4,Little Known History,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to show lots of fighting action between the Indians and early American settlers, but it turned out to be more of a documentary. It was interesting nevertheless because it showed how the Indians manipulated a young continental officer (George Washington) into starting the French and Indian War. To me it is amazing that George Washington never won a battle during the French and Indian War, yet was appointed by the Continental Congress to lead the army during the American Revolution. If you are more interested in history than action, this movie is for you."
5,Long Overdue Documentary About Braddock's Campaign,"This wonderful documentary film gives an account of the early days of the French and Indian War in the West, including George Washington's attack at Jumonville's Glen, his defeat at Fort Necessity, and Braddock's bloody slaughter at the Battle of the Monongahela. Using modern and contemporary drawings & paintings, interviews with reknowned historians and authors, as well as illustrating key events using re-enactments, When the Forest Ran Red is a long overdue documentary account of an important period in American history that is often forgotten. It is highly recommended for teachers, students, and history buffs alike."
5,It works perfect,We always hear friends of us with their kids with ear infections. Some of these are caused by trapped water in the ear. Because of those stories we were very concerned about our daugther. So i decided to looks for something that can help with water on her ear while on her swiming lessons. Yes i know she is 1 so what swimming lessons??ha ha well its kind of an introduction but the fact is that she is in the water. This things help a lot when she is splashing or other kids are doing that. Also when she puts her head on the water just for a moment it prevents the water for getting in her ears. I'm more relaxed now when she is in the pool. And she looks beautiful with that purple strap!!! I totally recommend them.
3,"okay, but not great","It fit and worked, but since my daughter likes to wear goggles while swimming, it didn't quite work as desired."
3,a little small,this ring is ok but alot smaller than i thought it would be. but that's the great thing about shopping through Amazon and Gem Avenue too. never a problem sending something back for a refund.
1,LAME LAME LAME. Don't waste your $$,"UGH. Sorry to voice a negative here, but this DVD is AWFUL and BORING.Don't bother. Save your $$."
1,PASS THE EGO PLEASE,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the 14 self serving images of this person Luan who wants us to believe that she is so spiritual. These are the actions of an ego driven person consumed with who they think they are. Luan...your words and actions don't match. The book smacked of a lot of events that don't really add up. Luan's deceased husband was known as a really great man who wouldn't be touting himself. He built the company in the first place...she didn't. I think the book makes too much of her alleged contributions to what was totally the work of Fred Mitchell and his grandfather.
4,paper doll lessons learned from a life lived in the headline,"I saw LuAn speak in Toronto I was so happy to see you had her new book...She really inspires a LOT of people, and she tells it like it is!Gosh Thanks Amazon... And you too LuAnI recomend this book to everyone...I just wish it didn;t end."
5,paper doll lessons learned from a life lived in the headline,This book is Hot!I really think it has changed my life for the better!WOW!get it and read it!
2,too expendive for what you get.,it does not really teaches hot to cut and it is too expensive for what you learn.it may help very bigenners.
5,Fun Pirate Movie,"Fun on the high seas! Sword fights! Guys in tight clothes! Shenanigans on the high seas! This movie has everything you want in an older pirate film. It's surprising because it doesn't start out as pirates. Instead a guy has to serve court papers on a sea captain, so he sneaks on board as a deckhand. But then, in a plot twist, the boat is attacked by pirates and the two guys end up fighting together against the bad guys while sailin to Hawaii. It's a ridiculous plot, but is good fun to sit down and veg out with. I liked it alot."
1,Be Warned,This is the most painfull listen I have ever experienced. I want anyone who may be thinking about buying this CD to know that the Korean Horn sample is played repeatedly for the entire duration of the track. This music reminds me of how I feel when my thought process is at it worst.
4,Great fit for general purpose photography,"I use these on the E500. The fit is perfect and for general ""walk around"" photography the bracket is perfect. If you want to get more creative, however, you would need a much more adjustable bracket."
5,A Comprehensive Thrashing of the Ex-Gay Crusade,"While having lunch with Wayne Besen last week in Manhattan I expressed my deep appreciation for his book, Anything but Straight. The book is a well written and thoroughly researched analysis of the structure and agenda of Ex-Gay ministries and therapies.In Anything but Straight, Besen weighs the doctrine and tactics of the Ex-Gay crusaders against the research and conclusions of mental health professionals, and reveals the political agenda that underwrites the Ex-Gay movement.Anything but Straight is a highly readable and entertaining overview of the battle for the homosexual soul."
1,I'm gay and thought this was vitriolic,"As a card carrying member of the gay community I have often found myself interested in this topic. Wayne Besen, who by the way has been called the Fred Phelps of our side, is not honest in his appraisal. While there have been failures in the ex-gay movement there are successes that have lasted for many years. A person can find exceptions to any rule - just like many in the heterosexual community do with us. But to write an entire book and give no credit where credit is due - well, its just not honest."
2,Low quality product,"I have had dental surgery to reduce my dental pockets. In the past I have bought the BARREL brush (not tapered) to clean my teeth. Worked great. However, Butler has chosen to discontinue this because (I guess for more money - to lesson the choices and reduce production costs) which is a problem. I have sent numerous emails to Butler but they have not responded but keep sending me ""sales promotion""Would not buy -Cathy Pruner (69)"
3,Would be better if 100% plastic,"These work very well for cleaning between teeth, especially after means when toothpicks just don't get the job done. The only problem I have with them is that the central ""stem"" is made of metal, which comes into contact with the teeth at times. Rubbing metal on the teeth isn't good, because it can wear away the enamel and lead to increased risk of cavities and tooth pain. I would rate these much higher if the whole thing was plastic instead of just the bristles."
1,Frankenstein's monster,"A miserable attempt by Motorola to create a high-end product that would combine all worlds. Originally rolled out over 8 years ago, it is obvious that Moto is dumping old stock onto the market. Crappy stereo, passable DVD player and a 3-generations old cable receiver. This thing is HUGE. Mine broke within 12 months. Too bad, because it practically took an act of God to get my cable company to authorize the receiver. When it died the cable co. insisted that I had a box from them already (!) and that I would need to return it to them in order to get a new one. Ha - I gave them this broken hunk of junk! No HD, no DVR, no ability to even upgrade the firmware on this beast. It perhaps was relevant & cool for 6 months in 2000, but it is a relic of another project gone wrong by the folks at Motorola.Avoid this product at all costs!!!"
1,Useless paperweight,"Worst audio product I've ever purchased. Can't even use the RADIO without terrible interference & static. Any audio input run through this piece of junk comes out the other side muffled & popping.Really not any value here. Motorola even replaced my item with a brand new one once....same problems. So, basically, this thing was designed by the Motorola summer interns."
5,Great Reciever!!,I bought the Dcp 501 on E bay Brand New for $104.00 sent to me.I love the system.Once you sit down and get the settings right it sounds great!!I highly recomend this reciever.You wont go wrong.I use the tunner on my DVD player although the tunner on the Dcp 501 worked.It didnt respond as quickly when changing the channels as the tunner on my DVD player.Other then that its a nice unit!1
3,Skip The Last 5 Minutes...,"Gene Le Brock plays a scientist who is experimenting w/ DNA in an attempt to reverse the aging process. When the university that's funding the project begins to pressure him for results, our intrepid scientist hurries things by injecting himself with an experimental serum. Big mistake! His body begins changing in bizarre ways, and he becomes a mutating serial-killer of sorts. METAMORPHOSIS is a good si-fi / horror movie up until the ultra-silly ending. That's when the wheels fly off! The final incarnation of the creature is ridiculous! It's some poor schmuck in a floppy, rubber dino-suit (Barney?), that looks like something in the halloween leftover bin at Wal-mart! Too bad, as the first 90% of this flick is dark and suspenseful. Oh well..."
5,Sweet Little Story and Adorable Illustrations,"We're big kids at heart and bought this book for ourselves. It's very sweet and nicely illustrated. We loved it so much that we decided to get the whole set all in one:The Little Bear Stories. Great for any youngster, or even those who are just young at heart, like us! Just lovely and very touching too. Oooooooh!! We just Love that little bear!!"
3,A Minnetonka Fan Review...,"I purchased this boot loving the style of the picture shown, but when I received it, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. I'll start out by saying the seam along the front toes wasn't sewn straight and so it makes the front of the boot look as though it's lumpy, especially after some wear and the buttons along the ankle I thought would be silver metal buttons, were upon receiving, a silver colored plastic instead."
4,Brings out the depth of the Aeneid.,"Another terrific book that has gone out of print!On the surface, Virgil's Aeneid is a fairly unproblematic (and not too interesting) story of the founding of the Roman people by Aeneas after he and his comrades flee the fall of Troy. Johnson really helped me to see that the story is actually much more complex, and much ""darker,"" than it seems."
3,PRODUCT IS OKAY,"My puppy loves her playpen. I liked it too in the beginning because she was more comfortable being left in it,BUT she was managing to chew through the front zipper door had I continued to leave her in it for a period of time. Mind you this is only a 3 lb dog. But as far as moving the playpen around my house, I loved it, was well as the removable pad in the bottome for easy cleaning. If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,Mixed Thoughts,"It's very cute. Seems like a great idea. As for my beagle, who was 2 months, now 4, he hates it. He chews it, and now is tall enough to jump out. If you have a dog or a puppy that can handle being inside one, It's fantastic. It's compact, airy, comes with a Velcro bottom to wetproof. Nice little treat pouch. Great for small dogs who behave well (or fairly well lol)."
5,Pet Gear PG4200BS Pet Pen,"I got this play pen for my maltipoo puppy. I think that it's great. The lining that was provided is easy to clean, and it also comes with a nice fleece pad and a little bag to put all little stuff. The play pen was enough to put a training tray on one side and his bed on the other. Great for training purposes. I also like how there's a zipped door on one end so he can get in and out once he grows up.I'm really happy with this product."
5,Great for Puppoes,"I purchased this play pen for my 5 english bulldog puppies when we went camping, and it was great! Easy to put up and down and easy to clean!"
4,my opinion,"The textsides of this book are in a good state.It is a pity that the former owner, the The Columbia State Community College,sticked an ugly mark to the yellow book cover which was unnecesary.Some smaller stamps would also be very useful.So the greatest ""damage"" to the book has been done by the library and not by the students.(They seem to be not interested in this outstanding book.)Never mind: thank you for this book!Thomas Rychener, Berne-Switzerland"
3,OKAY,"I always enjoy Ms. Muller's familiarity with the San Francisco bay area. Her newer books are much more complex and interesting than the earlier ones which I believe ""Eye of the Storm"" is."
1,Typos!!!,"Have always enjoyed Marcia Muller's books, but this one felt like she wrote it in a weekend, just because she needed to knock out another mystery. The dialogue was stilted, as was the situation, and it was easy to figure out who the ""villan"" was. That being said, what really bothered me was the fact that there was at least one, and often two or three, typo per page. It was so irritating that I found myself counting them rather than enjoying the book. By and large, it was a disappointing read and one in which I felt that the author was insulting her readers."
4,Cute patterns but milk leaks through the fabric,"I wanted a lighter weight fabric cover for summer, and this came in great patterns. It is a tight fit on the pillow, but I like that it stays in place. Mine washes well and has no problems with zippers or twisting seams like other reviewers have noted. My only complaint about the cover is that the fabric is too thin and milk goes right through it onto the foam pillow. I did not have this problem with the velour cover that originally came with it. I wish the cotton was a little thicker, or was lined with a slight more milk-resistant fabric."
2,Pretty but Not Durable,"Bright, fun cover pattern, but not well made. After only one wash, I was re-covering the foam insert and the zipper broke. I am very disappointed in the quality. The zipper on the deluxe cover, which I purchased at the same time, is better quality and has held up better so far."
3,Cotton is nice but the strap isn't great without the velcro,"The cover is a great backup to my fleece cover, however the strap is not as nice as the one that originally came with the pillow. There is no velcro to help keep it in place and it has a tendency to tilt the pillow. Otherwise, the colors are cute and its easy to wash."
5,Cute cover,This cover is cute. The colors are not very bright. I wish they were in bolder colors. Holds up well after several washes and pretty thick fabric
2,after one wash,Poor quality. Pattern and colors faded after one wash! I washed on delicate cycle and hung it to dry. It frayed also.
5,Love My Brest Friend,I am absolutely in love with My Brest Friend pillow. No other product compares to it. I am exclusively breastfeeding (no bottles or pacifiers) and have been using it for 2 months so far and many more to come. I ordered an additional slipcover for it so I have an extra to put on when one needs washed. I love all the cute slipcover designs. They wash great and haven't faded. I even accidentally put one in the dryer and it didn't even shrink.
3,online photo is misleading,"Does not look like the image online/the image on the packaging. The design is totally different. Nice enough, and it serves its purpose. But the image online is misleading."
5,Love it!,I LOVE my brest friend. And this cover is so cute I hate taking it off to wash it. I'm so happy I bought this nursing pillow vs the boppy!
4,Study as they come!,"I got out this rebounder today to give it a try. I have to admit that it was a workout just getting it set up, but it was effortless to break-down. I used it with a rebounder DVD and it is very durable and really works. The bag is hard to work with to put it away, but I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"Homeschoolers, beware the bias.","Although this book is recommended by some homeschooling programs as a history text, I found it to be unacceptable because of its extreme anti-Catholic bias, reminiscent of Foxe's Book of Martyrs."
5,Back to those days,"It's Steve Dorff composing at his best. Great guest stars (Take 6, Bill Medley, Kenny Rogers...) Very good sound, 80's hi-tech production, incredible compositions. If you like this, I also recomend ""The secret of my sucess"" and ""Romancing the stone"" from David Foster and Alan Silvestri. Here you'll find the best ""californian"" sound: great not distorted electric guitars, great keyboards in the L.A. style and the magic of the great Steve. The last track, a medley of Steve's hits, will take your breath away.A must have."
2,Poor design,"This product seemed like an excellent idea, especially during power outages. However, this phone backup system was poor in quality and design. This system requires you to use your cordless phone's power adaptor to plug into one of four power input holes. This feeds power into the backup system. My phone's power adaptor didn't fit or couldn't grip onto one of the one of the flimsy wires or plugs in one of the holes."
2,not powerful enough,"the product description should state what the packaging does, that the unit only provides 500mA at 12V.i wouldn't have purchased if i had known it was so puny.:("
3,Thought my kids would have more interest in it,"I got this for my kids last Christmas, so we have had it about 10 months now. In that entire time, they have not played with it once.I really think it's super cute, and I love bowling, but they just have no desire to bring this set off the shelf. I've tried to set it up and play solo, to show them how it works, but they still have no interest.The pieces are good quality, the designs are adorable, and I would totally play with this myself! Unfortunately, my kids are lame and won't touch it."
3,"Pins are adorable, Ball is worthless","This was delivered late...supposed to arrive on a Thursday, didn't come until Monday, which is unfortunately as it was a birthday gift for a 3 year old.The pins are adorable, and are weighted well they are easy to set up.The ball it comes with isn't even round, and its so light even I couldn't knock down any pins with it. Another ball will be need to play with the set. I'd give the pins 5 stars, but the ball is so essential to the whole kit...I'm giving 3 for that reason."
3,"Cute toy, but not much fun for a 2 year old.","This is a really cute toy and my 22 month old son did seem to be interested in it for the first 5 minutes we had it. He now has turned the game into a game of fetch for our dog. So, I can confirm that this is a durable toy! I think this may be better for older children. I plan on trying again in about 6 months or so."
3,Ok Toy,"Okay toy, very cute. But bowling pins fall down when trying to set them up and my child gets bored of this game quickly."
1,Plastic Carrying Case a Hazard for Toddlers and Babies,"The bowling game is moderately fun. The ball is fairly useless since it is not round, but the characters are cute and my three children are amused by them.My issue is with the soft plastic carrying case, which fits neatly over my toddler son's face and head. I'm concerned that the case could present a suffocation hazard to babies and small toddlers who may not be strong or coordinated enough to remove it from their faces. The clear plastic is attractive and fun for babies to look through and it can fit over their entire heads and even be at least partially zipped closed while on their heads, the prospect of which I find very frightening.I usually love Melissa & Doug products, but they have used this plastic material on a number of the toys they market to babies and toddlers (see my review of the fill and spill toolbox). They need to design these carrying cases out of fabric or mesh to avoid a potential tragedy."
5,Cute,Bought for 2 and 1/2 year old great grandson for Christmas and he loves it. He likes playing with each critter as well as using them for bowling balls. Cute figures.
3,Cute but not practical,"I got this on a daily deal buy for $10. My son is only 15 months old so he hasn't used it a ton yet, but as far as I can tell as a bowling set this is somewhat of a flop. The monsters do not have the best balance and the ball doesn't do a great job at knocking them down. However, the monsters are adorable, and my son LOVES the ball with the monster like face on it.. so it isn't a total waste. For $10 I would buy it again, but not for actual retail value."
4,Monster Bowling was great for my nephew!,"I sent Monster Bowling to my 17 month old nephew for Christmas. I just went to visit him and I could see how much he enjoyed it. He carries the monsters around, places them below his slide and slides into them, and he also carries them to the top of the slide and tosses them down. They have multiple uses and he just thinks they're funny looking! Good choice for little ones!"
2,"Cute, but not worth the money","Although this set is pretty cute and very colorful I wasn't impressed.Pros: What kid doesnt like to knock things over? It's soft, so no ""throwing at each other"" concerns.Cons: Doesn't work on carpet. Attracts dog hair like crazy!!! Pretty small.I didn't keep this toy out for very long the kids didn't care for it enough to take up space in the playroom."
2,I think its adorable but my daughter hates it,"My 20 month old has never played with this toy but I think its adorable. I think the recommeded age may be 2, maybe I will pull it back out in a year. Its a totally cute toy though, I would almost rather put them on a shelf in her room for decoration."
3,"Cute, but not an effective bowling game.","It's cute and well-constructed, but the pins don't knock down easily enough. They support each other too much, makeing it frustrating to play."
4,toddlers love this!,My nephew loved this toy at age 2 and 3. He thinks it's really funny and loves to knock the pins down and to talk to them as well!
3,Cute but can't actually bowl...,"The monsters are soft fur, cute and better suited as a simple set of stuffed animals. The ball supplied just isn't sturdy enough to use."
2,not used,"I thought this would be a great gift for a 3 year old. It was well constructed and the monsters were very cute. In fact, they even stood up well and were easy to handle. However, the ""bowling ball"" was not easy to use. It did not roll in a direct fashion due to assorted shapes on the ball. So, when the kids tried to use it, it did not reach its goal. If you are able to use another ball, it would be very functional. I have found that the 3 year does not play with it."
4,I wish they were bigger!,"This toy is very cute, those little soft monster pint stand alone just fine (i think the craftsmanship are pretty well made). Though i wish these pints were a little bigger, when i make the purchase i really thought those pint will measure up to 8.75 inch, however, after i measure them myself, their size only come up to 6.5 inch maximum =-1 star. Even though they are a bit small, but they are still fun to play with, my 3 yr old nephew loves to play with these monster. He even went out shopping with 1 or 2 pints in his backpack, i think my money are well spend on this toy, and i highly recommend them to all young kid's parents.I agree that the ball that comes with the set don't work really well like one of the reviewer had mentioned (we end up picking up a ball just a little bigger from walmart for less then $2, and it works just fine)."
2,"cute, but sits in the toy box","Let me just say first of all that I think this is the cutest bowling set ever, but with that being said, my 2 year old son never got this toy out of the toy box by himself. I was the one who always suggested we play with the set only to watch him loose interest in a few seconds. And the ball is easier thrown at the pins than rolled because of its uneven shape. There are so many other great toys made by the Melissa and Doug Co. to choose from but this one I wish I would have passed on."
3,Never played with.,"I bought this set for my son's first birthday thinking (because he loves to throw balls) that he'd love this. Plus it was on sale and I got it for $20.He's had more fun with the plastic zip bag the set comes in. He loves to unzip the bag, pull all the monsters out and throw them around, then he's done.The monsters are cute, soft, and pretty durable. The ball is cute, but a little lopsided so it doesn't roll very well.If it came down to it again I'd spend the twenty dollars on something else."
5,Perfect gift!,"This was a present for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. It was a few days before Halloween, so I thought the monsters would be appropriate. She loved it and played with it right away. She even used the monsters as ""pets."""
4,Adorable and fun!,"These little monsters are sturdy and soft - they sit up well and are cuddly, too! My 2-year old has learned to bowl after one showing...well, ok, she takes the bowling ball and knocks the pins down by simply pushing them over, but she loves it all the same. Unless your child understands the concept of knocking down pins in the traditional bowling way, they'll likely just carry around the monsters and ball as the surprisingly soft, cuddly, funny stuffed toys that they are. What's wrong with that, right? For the price, you've got a 2 in 1!"
2,"God, I hate this story","I just reread it in a collection of Nobel Prize winning authors--their acceptance speeches etc., and this story and ""As I Lay Dying"" were chosen as examples of his work. This story!!! It's such a mundane little macabre ""gotcha"" story, over-anthologized for high school students (along with other tired stories like ""The Most Dangerous Game""). Faulkner is such an incredible writer--I'm reading Fury in the Dust right now, and his sentences--the Nobel Prize committee described them as being ""as powerful as Atlantic rollers"". What was he thinking when he wrote ""A Rose for Emily""? Obviously not much. Read anything else by him, you'll have a better time."
3,Hardly worth a continental,"Other than reminding us of women camp followers, this book really doesn't do that much of a job informing us of the men who served in America's founding. Just as he fails to truly remind us of his ability to improvise. Often wearing the simple much better suited Hunting Shirt when euorpean uniforms were available. Often bringing a modified fowling piece used for hunting when muskets were not to be had, along with powder horn and shot bag when cartridge boxes were not available. And I thought it rather boring.Osprey usually produces better."
3,"Good, but definitely could be better","I bought this book having already purchased the Ultimate French Beginner-Intermediate, which is excellent, and hoping for the same quality from the Portuguese edition. However, I did not find this book to be of nearly as good quality as the French (and German, which I now own too) editions. This book has many errors, in both English and Portuguese, and does not include all new words used in the chapter in the vocabulary list at the end. And for the words it does include, it often arbitrarily puts verbs in a random conjugation (not the standard infinitive form) and adjectives and nouns in the feminine and/or plural forms without saying so. It also does not include the definite or indefinite article with nouns, to show the noun gender. All in all, it gets the job done, but it doesn't make it easy for the learner, who must already know some Portuguese grammar, or do some outside research to make sense of the vocabulary."
3,Okay for Brazilian Portuguese but not specific...,"This book is the book my class used to study Brazilian Portuguese. I only assume it was chosen due to a lack of specific Brazilian Portuguese classroom books/training aides. The assignments in the book were pretty good and the answer key was handy. My teacher, from So Paulo, was constantly making changes for Brazilian Portuguese. Hey, I learned the language with this book and the class together, so it wasn't all that bad. There is probably a much better book to use in conjunction with a Brazilian Portuguese class."
5,Definitely better than 1 star!,"The 1 star poster makes it sounds like this stuff is so fragile that it will tear if you bump it. Not so. We did our attic with this stuff, and it works great.It's reinforced with thread. It's definitely NOT just like aluminum foil. My two year old disobeyed our requests and ran across the stuff, jumped on it, and rolled on it a few times while it was on the carpet. It didn't break.I mean, this is going in the attic. How strong does it need to be? Anyway. It works well and doesn't deserve a 1 star rating. 125' of this stuff vs 50' of the other -- and it's more expensive, to boot? No thank you. This stuff is cheap and it works.We installed this stuff and forgot about it and pocketed the more than 50% difference."
2,"Very, very slow","Despite having to reset the router multiple times because it has trouble handling more than one connection at a time, it is extremely slow. The wired connection runs at about 1/2 to 1/3 the speed of my netgear router, and the wireless connection is quite slow too. However, it works for the most part and I have not had much trouble lately. It is still slow though."
3,Good value,"Setup was a breeze, took about 10 minutes to install and set-up with WPA using direct IP addressing. There is an install disk with a GUI setup wizard for novices but I didn't touch it so I don't know how easy it is. The range could be better but I haven't experimented with changing frequencies, I am letting the router manage this for now."
4,Good but not the greatest,It is a good router. It has some useful features but they are not that great. I recommend buying it when it is on sale.
2,Reliability is poor - locks up alot,"It's ok - I've had it a while and it is still kicking. It does lock up on a somewhat regular basis - few times a week - so it requires frequent unplugging and plugging back in. The cord and socket are robust enough to take it. When it is working it is fine. Customer service does not seem to be US based, but it is ok. I had better luck with Linksys."
2,This router does NOT have parental controls,"Bought the router to ease life in 'big brothering' our network. It arrived, set it up, and the option for it has disappeared!Called support - they hung up 2 seconds after I asked! Guess he was tired of that question. Got through again, another tech explained they'd had so many problems they discontinued it. That would make this just like any other G router.Also, had problem connecting with WPA - needed to set authentication to the 3rd option (not the default)...think it was wpa-pskOther than that seems ok. Setup was pretty easy with the wizard."
4,good buy with lifetime guarantee,"The wireless g router f5d7230-4 was easy to set up initially, but either we didn't figure out how to use the CD software to set up security or it wasn't an easy-to-see option in the software, or who knows why... So the security was be set up by using the menus in the router (after logging into the router). That included an admin password. About the only configuration we were prompted for when using the software was the network name.After security setup, getting our laptop wireless setup to connect to it went smoothly.All in all, this router has been in use for several weeks, and to this point has been a very good deal, and hopefully will continue to be a good deal, as long as the lifetime warranty pans out."
1,trash!,Worked fine for 2 months then it strated droping the wireless conection as other mentioned. first twice a week now it is every 20 minutes!! look for something else! Several people seem to be having the same problem.
2,"Good for basic stuff, not for networks w/ web-type servers","This router is fine for simple network Peer to peer, hooking up multiple computers to the internet for web browsing. However, the routers software has serious flaws on it's port forwarding/virtual server configuration. Basically, it won't allow you to enter in your settings. This means you can't run a web server, ftp server, etc with through this. Tech support is non-existant. I've tried the lastest and older firmware, they all have the same problem."
1,Failed within a Year,"This item worked well for the first few months then recently became very unreliable. My connections were dropped more and more frequently until eventually, even power resets failed to reconnect it."
1,Better for tarket pratice than a router,"It Drops connections like its going outta style. Forget trying to change a setting, it'll be 30 minutes of frustration just to get back online again with the setting the same as before. This Belkin router is the worst electronic product i've ever owned."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this from Walmart because of the price tag. But after the first day it would keep dropping the connection to my modem. I would have to reinstall the software at least once a week. When I got a brand new Motoroloa cable modem it wouldn't work with it at all. besides all of that it was incredibly SLOW. I would rather just plug the wire into my computer. Save you money and buy something better.
2,Bridge mode difficulties,The current version of this router (7000) does not support bridging to older versions of the 7240-4. If you plan on using it in a bridged network call Belkin to verify that it will work.The posted documentation on Amazon is not for the current version of the product.
1,Worst Wireless Router,"I bought this wireless router to use with my HP notebook. I had it for a few months and it was working PERFECTLY! GREAT speed and all! BUT after a short while, the router decided to work only when IT wanted to work. My laptop detected the router and connected to it no problem, but the router wasn't sending any information to my laptop. SO WEIRD! My boyfriend has the exact same router and had the exact same problem! I would have to unplug the router and let it sit for about a minute in order for it to start working again. I eventually gave up on the router and replaced it with a Linksys. It was good while it was working, but it gave out too soon! I guess thats why Belkins are so cheap."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this router after a friend recommended the brand. My router did not install as it should of. I spent well over a week calling tech support DAILY, only to keep doing the SAME things over and over again. Two weeks into it, I am STILL ""waiting for a level 2 tech"" to call me back. I had to pay someone to come to my house and fix it for me. VERY VERY disappointing when something doesn't work and the people who are supposed to help with support issues.....don't!"
1,hmm..,"Almost half the price of linksys, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Worked great for the first minute or two after I installed it, then it fried my internet connection. Now, every time I attempt to connect it to my cable modem, my cable modem stops sending a signal. I have to unplug the Belkin router and reset the cable modem in order to get any internet at all, and even then I can only access the internet by plugging in directly to the landline."
1,I hate this router!,I get sick and tired of this router! It's terrible! The connection drops so quickly that everytime i plug in back in the connection drops again! I even try counting for a little bit to before plugging/unplugging the router.....and that obviously doesn't work. Everytime the connection drops i just want to take the router and throw it!!!!!!!!!
1,"Drops out, Port Forwarding NO Good","Not sure if this is exactly the same product:Our purchase:Belkin F6D3230-4 wireless A+G router:the port 80 pass through does Not workwe cannot see our web server from outside the LANPrevious router (non wireless Navini) worked fine.Internal Lan can see the web serverDirect connect of Server to ISP enables world to see our web serverSo it seems the Belkin ""virtual server"" is faultyWith WEP I connect OK but my manager, about 8 metres away, drops out. With no WEP all are on OK.Reboot of router required about once per day."
1,do not purchase this router,I have only given it one star because there is no option for zero stars.I have owned one of these routers for several months. It is a totally unreliable piece of crap.Constantly fails to connect to web sites. Constantly needs to be de-powered and re-powered to establish a connection. Do a little research and you will find many people with the same problem/opinion. Stores should not be selling this product at any price. Caveat emptor!
1,complete and utter rubbish,"I own this router along with a Belkin Access Point that I'm attempting to get to work together. I've had to replace the AP once already and the replacement is no better. I've just ""upgraded"" the firmware on the router and now the router has ceased to function. I'm about 8 hours into this project which includes a ridiculous hour on the phone with Belkin tech support plus trips to the post office to ship gear back to them at my expense. I'm about to give all of the Belkin gear away and switch to something that actually works (for example, I configured two AP's and a firewall/router at work in about 15 minutes).And for a real laugh, Belkin's idea of security is to display the network's SSID without someone needing to log in. Um, right, that's secure."
1,Will never buy a belkin product again,"After years of dealing with networks and using many other types of routers I purchased a belkin wireless router. I wish I had done my homework, but with technology today I figured who could mess up a wireless router. Well they did. Since I installed it, I have one computer who can not print to my laser printer, but another computer can print to both. Belkin took no responsibility for it when I contacted tech support. I lose my connection all the time. It drives me nuts."
1,Not worth the money! Unreliable!,This router has been nothing but headaches for us. We have to frequently unplug the cables in order to get our iPad or BlueRay to work. It is a total pain.
2,Belkin routers don't work well with Charter internet,"I'm not sure who's fault it is, but almost every time you change a setting in the Belkin routers, it tries to re-initialize DHCP and fails forcing you to turn off the cable modem and wait.I personally think their hardware is good, but the Belkin software that comes with the router is a piece of garbage and it's a really limited firewall.I'd say it'd be good for the non-power user but I can't even say that because of their issues with Charter.I personally think they should dump their own OS and switch to DDWRT as a base, with their own UI on top. DDWRT is a much better router software."
3,"Works, but don't count on it lasting","My review will be brief and to the point, instead of these long-winded ones.- Not so trivial to setup...I've seen much easier.- Hold it in your hands and recognize the flimsy craftsmanship.- Fairly reliable. Was rather consistent with its performance, until...- Lifetime brief.- RESET button, which is a must with this item, is horrible. Use it once and you might break it. Instead of a BUTTON, they provide you with a hole in which to insert a slim pen or similar. Don't expect it to last.- Buy a Linksys"
1,Don't even bother buying this,"I have had this router for 1 month now, and it was a waste of money. The router needs to be re-set at least once a day, and if you are trying to download anything disconnect it or it will crash!!The customer support line is a joke. For example, I was promised a replacement 2 weeks ago, and I still haven't received it.If you have money to waste go ahead and buy this, otherwise, stay as far away from this product as possible."
1,Not worth the effort,"Our previous wireless G belkin router conked out by losing it's radio signal. The computer whiz son had set it up but he's off on his own now. I purchased a replacement and meticulously set it up per instructions. The LAN part worked OK and after an hour of putsing the wireless sprang into life - for a while. Now none of the household laptops can connect by wireless, including the unit I first succeeded in connecting. Power-off-resets of everyting in the building, re-configuration of the laptops and resetting the Belkin router have proven fruitless. I'm resigned to having a wired household until we can locate a product that operates better than this. The Belkin wireless G is in the garbage with a boot print on it. Adios."
1,The worst router ever,"I have been using wireless routers for about 10 years now, but have never come across a router worse than this one. It is totally unreliable, disconnects every 2 minutes, you need to reset it to make it work.Stay away from it."
1,Repetedly loses the wireless connection,"This router will work fine for a few hours. It will then lose the wireless connection and the only way to get it back is to unplug and plug the router back in, wait a few minutes and the connection comes back. I would not recommend buying it."
2,Cheap -- but not reliable,"On one hand, these are cheap little routers. They work most of the time. However, I have now had 3 of these, and the first two have been very flaky -- dropping wireless pretty consistently. I will say that it wasn't a problem to get it replaced under warranty, though. I guess for a cheap unit like this, it's not worth their time to troubleshoot, they just send you a new one. So I appreciated that.I've also noticed that the look/model of these changes rapidly. I wonder if they are OEMing different models from manufacturers making ultra-cheap hardware. I can't say I'm very impressed."
1,Belkin router,Only the older Broadcom based ones are worth dealing with since you can put custom firmware on them.
4,Easier than Linksys,"Well it was a lot easier to setup than the Linksys WRT54GS router it replaced, but unless you have newer equipment with one of the automated setup methods it still requires either knowledge of networking or some trial and error. The range is about what I expected for a low priced unit. My wife's laptop shows 3 bars (out of 5) for signal strength from 25 feet away through 3 ordinary plaster board interior house walls. My previous Linksys router, which cost three or four times as much, showed 5 bars. So far it's a good buy, especially for the price."
1,Piece of garbage...or my bad luck,"I have had it with this piece of trash router! I bought the first one and after fighting with it for a week, it worked for about a week and then died on me. I spoke with about 3 incompetent customer service rep's (if you can even call it service) and finally brought it back to the store I bought it from. So I exchanged it figuring that I might have just picked up a bad one. Router # 2 was decent, it had its in and out moments, and now within about 8 months, this one stopped working and yes this is a testable claim because the internet I'm on now only works when it is not hooked up to this crappy router. Customer service is like a a human reading a prompter and I have no more patience to deal w/ this thing. It is trash, don't waste your money even if it is cheap because it is so inconvenient when it dies at the end of the semester!"
1,My roommates hate me!,"I got this router because it was cheap. I should have known that you get what you pay for. I have to reset it 2-3 times a day. My roommates are constantly losing their wireless connection. Every 20 minutes they yell, ""Your router stinks!"" I found out there is a class action lawsuit against Belkin, in which this product is included. I am getting rid of it and buying another brand."
1,Doesnt last for long,I regret buying this product since day1 u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after 6 months only it died on me.
1,never got to find out if it worked,"In trying to get it set up, I went through multiple help technicians, most of whom were difficult to understand All that was accomplished was to mess up our internet connection, and then was told that my ISP would have to straighten out the problems Belkin created. One technician was honest enough to admit that the install disc was practically worthless. Otherwise, it was nothing but a headache of waiting on the phone, being cut off, being shuttled around, and getting nothing done. We did finally have good success, with another product."
1,Would not recommend this router,A good price but got what I paid for. Unit runs fine for a while then just stops for several seconds(about 20) then starts again. Would NOT recommend buying this.
1,DO NOT BUY - Version 7000 is being recalled,"Be careful what you buy from Belkin! I purchased this router and never got it to work. While on the phone with Belkin customer service, I was asked two different times if I was sure I had Version 7000 (as indicated on the bottom). I confirmed that I did, and she finally told me to just return it and get a different one. I bought a Netgear router and it's working just fine."
1,Crap,"Wow, Belkin is terrible. I have a Belkin Router and Modem, and both suck, big time. Every day, the connection fails. Whether I'm surfing the net or in the middle of an AIM conversation. Then I have to reconnect the modem, and re-install the router. It takes several minutes. And get this, it disconnected in the middle of writing this review. But it gets annyoing when you have to do it twice a day. Skip this one."
1,"""wireless?""","I bought a Belkin G wireless Router. I am not sure what is supposed to be ""wireless"" about it though.Having an older house with just one phone line in the corner of the bedroom makes DSL very difficult. I currently use a 30-40 ft long phone cord dragged through the house to connect the actual CPU to the phone-line.With the Belkin ""wireless"" router I would have to hook the Router to the phone line and hook the Router to the CPU still and both have to run through the regular DSL Modem.So what the router did for me was cost me about $40.00. I serves no other function, and once you get it home and try to make it ""wireless"" you'll find that it is not wireless.If you have a phone line right where you desk top computer is located you could set up the ""wireless"" router to run an additional computer or a laptop for example in another room. But for those of use that have older houses, the ""wireless"" router seems like the best route to go is getting an Air-card."
5,10 minutes up and running,"I am a technological dunderhead and it still worked out of the box for me. I followed the directions in the package exactly and it works great. The only other tip I needed to follow was disabling Windows nearly useless firewall. We don't have any other computers networked, but we did connect our Wii to this and I am able to access the internet on our second floor with my Palm TX now with a fairly strong signal. My kids asked me if I can get online while I poop.(in our upstairs bathroom) Yes, I can!!"
1,Cheap for a reason - the wireless doesn't work,"I have to reboot my laptop every time it hibernates to use the wireless. When I disconnect this and reconnect my old Linksys, I don't have this problem. I spent ages thinking it must be the laptop, but it's just this cheap piece of junk. Avoid!"
1,Garbage!!!,"Had the router for only 3 weeks. Started dropping the internet connection to both my laptop & desktop within 3 days. Belkin told me to change the settings after I sant them numerous emails for help. Now, one week after I set this up, the router is completely dead. Belkin hasn't responded to any of my emails since I told them about this 3 week old product dying out on me.Buy a Linksys, it will save you the trouble in the long run."
2,Unfortunately is useless for me,"I had really hard time to install this router in my network with 2 desktop & 1 laptop. The problem for me is there are no way to forward port. there is no manual at all, and while installing it asks to add IP address for each compluter> You can enter whatever you want it's never accepted. Anyway I'm still using my old router that drop the WIFI sometime. Can I send it back?"
3,Good for novices...,"I purchased the router here, but received one that looks completely different and does NOT have parental control (but it had the same model number). I called Belkin and they informed me that they no longer made the one with parental control (but they still used the same model number!??). They agreed to exchange mine for an older one with parental control, and I received it in 2 days. I got it installed but found out that it only supports ONE VPN connection (that's only one--either one incoming or one outgoing). My old SMC allowed for multiple VPN connections in both directions simultaneously, which is a necessity for me. I guess I'll have to keep looking for good parental control."
1,buy a different router,"This router can be configured to work, but not if you use FTP or any other type of server (think online games...) on you computer. Even with the firewall disabled, i can only connect to my website FtP server at about 1.6 kb/sec. This is on a DSL connection.Belkin Tech support cannot offer a solution. My recommendation? Get a different router."
1,Waste of time,"I had Linksys ""B"" router and wanted to upgrade to ""g"". I got a good deal on a Belkin G router and tried installing it. After two nights and almost 6 hours on the phone with customer service, I gave up and returned it. My past experience with Belkin products has been very good. However, now having used their technical support, I think Belkin's customer service stinks. They kept trying to blame my pc, modem and Verizon DSL. Well, after I gave up with their router and plugged my Linksys back in I was fine. Belkin has a long way to go with improving its tech support. This may have been one lemon but I'm turned off for life."
1,cant use a product that does not work,it was defective.....called belkin...they said take it back to whom you bought it. dont know if i will ever deal with belkin again
2,ROUTER,The router only worked for a day then went out.I would not bye a used one again.get a new router!!!!!
1,All Belkins routers are bad,"Kept dropping connections, would not initiate a connection, caused problems with my cable modem. Belkin support is a big ZERO. I would not buy another Belkin product ever."
3,Works but needed new firmware to work with Cable Modem,"Well it works now. I was expecting to just plug it in and connect the cables. We ended up having a field service representative from the cable internet company talk to Belkin customer service. 3 hours later new firmware was installed and it finally worked. Seems like if they have the new firmware they should just put it on there at the factory. Very disappointing, hopefully this is fixed now if you order one."
3,ok,"It was ok until broken...all good, but the hole where the power adapter goes got lose and can't plug it anymore, a waste, otherwise it did good while working."
3,Cool,I have had no issue with it really. Ever now and then I have to restartedd my laptop so it can pickup the wireles signal but orher than that everythings fine
2,connection problems!,"This unit is a good wireless access point but a really lousy router and gateway. The worst flaw is that it can't handle too many connections, otherwise internet applications like Internet Explorer won't be able to connect to ANY web site! The WAN (DSL) connection also disconnects several times during the day for some unknown reason. I ended up stacking the unit with a Linksys gateway for my DSL because the Belkin has too many quirks and issues. If you already have a wired DSL/cable router and need wireless ability, this is a good choice, otherwise you can find something better."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"The router we wanted was not stocked in the store so we took the Belkin on the advice of the clerk. It did not work at first. Finally after lots of resetting it allowed internet to the pc for a minute. I tried without firewall to same result. Finally, I could at least keep the internet to the pc but the laptop would not connect. Then after a week it started to work for five or six days. The connection would drop every 5 minutes. Then it would not work at all. Tech support was terrible. Total waste of time and when he sent me to the level two his only idea was to shut off the firewall. Thats when I hung up and boxed the thing up and returned it. Bought a Linksys and it worked perfectly."
1,ad was misleading,"THIS WAS MIS-LEADING ! This is a router only, not a combination router/cable gateway. I oredered this and was dismayed to find that I had to waste time returning this, because I needed a DSL gateway. Atlanta Technologies wasted my time."
1,Just Awful,There is no worse headache than the constant dropped internet connection. Belkin is the worst waste of money I have spent on internet connection. Please Buy Linksys or anything but Belkin.
1,Utter Junk,"Hardware version: 7000. Firmware version: 9.01.05.This thing was an utter waste of my time. The radio button for enabling and disabling UPnP always came up disabled, even if I just selected Enabled and clicked Apply Changes. When I checked for an update to the firmware through the web interface, I got the error message, ""Cannot connect to the firmware information server, please double check the wan connection."" even though all computers on the LAN were able to access the internet at that time. Then the router would lose it's internet connection during big downloads. A quick check of the logs showed that the router was sending out DHCP requests every two minutes. Belkin tech support was a joke. ""Try disabling any pop up or antivirus software before applying changes, try from another computer. [sic]"" Really? Funny how no other router I've encountered thus far has EVER had trouble with pop-up blockers or anti-virus software."
1,Piece of TRASH!,"I agree with the previous rating....we must bring that star rating of three down! This router...I don't even want to call it a router....This contraption is a complete waste of money! I know it's cheaper than many others, but gosh! It's not worth the twenty dollars I paid! It loses the connection every 2-3 minutes. That's ridiculous considering my pc is only about four feet (and with a clear path) from the thing. The router gets so hot after about 30 minutes, the base may actually burn you. Do not even conjure up the idea in head to consider buying this! Congrats, Belkin! You have out done yourself with this piece of s**t!"
1,Don't buy it unless you have a room temperature under 60C,"I bought it in winter and it worked great until the hot days came. I don't like to use AC when the room temp is only 70 some degree. But this router doesn't like the temperature. I believe it is heating problem because once you unplug the power for a while and let it cool down, it will start to work, only not more than 1 minutes. Dont waste you money."
1,Junk,"I've been trying for over a month to get some help getting this thing to work. Customer support is no help whatsoever. I have a brand new laptop and it won't connect to the internet. There's an icon that says I'm connected but when I open internet explorer, I'm told there isn't an internet connection.I'm definitely going with the recommendations of other users to get a D-Link or a Lynksys."
2,Frequent Lost Connections,"I've had this router for about six months, and about every other day, the router loses its connection, changing its flashing green lights to solid amber. I contacted Belkin, and they instructed me to update the firmware, which makes sense. But that didn't improve the problem at all. So to get the router working again, I pull its power brick from the wall, wait a few seconds, and plug it back. And it works for another day or two. This is a very frustrating experience.On the plus side, in my house of about 3,000 square feet, I generally have good reception."
1,Run Like the Wind Bullseye,"I noticed that some reviewers love the product and some hate it. I wonder if Belkin has a quality control problem. My router worked for about 30 minutes though I did to have turn off security for wireless to connect. Figured I would do my own security via MAC filtering. MAC filtering worked for 10 minutes and then it died. When I called Belkin I noticed that: 1) This model router has an option (#1) on their technical support line (that should tell you something), no other product has an option. 2) It took less than 10 minutes for me to establish that the products was dead with their techs but 30 minutes on hold with their returns department before I spoke to a human. As noted by other reviewers you have to pay for the shipping the dead router back to Belkin. This was an educational experience for me. Next time I'm going with another product."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH APPLE,"I bought this since it was cheap and I figured I could save a few bucks over linksys or netgear, but that is about as good as it gets with this. It is incompatible with Airport Extreme cards in older macs. The range is about 5 ft max with this and it frequently drops your connection every 20 minuets. Also I tested this with my iBook g4 and my iPhone and neither worked. I would not buy this due to all of the low ratings and get a linksys as I have an old wireless b from linksys that has been on 24/7/365 for about 4 years now!"
2,Lived good for a year before starting its slow death,"Year 1 was good. Can't complain too much about it considering the price. Then started year two. I have to unplug the darn thing at least 10 times a day since the router just dies all of a sudden. I don't know what to think. I blame myself for buying the cheapest thing on the shelf but then for every person that raves about the Linksys there is another person that says its garbage. I think a company out there needs to be build a solid router and not really worry about price because if it'll work and continue to work I think we'll all pay the higher price.In short I wouldn't buy this router. Pay more and buy the Linksys, I guess, but its a toss-up on what your experience will be with any wireless router *sigh* I just want a product that works!"
2,Worked for a while,"I've had this router for about a year. It worked decently for a time. Recently, I noticed the numbers for the wired connections had turned orange. That's odd, I'm pretty sure they had been green. Yes, after checking my dad's identical model, they were green. So I figured it had something to do with how hot the unit was getting. I had read others talking about overheating issues. I unplugged it and didn't use it for awhile. After plugging it back in, the numbers were back to green and everything appeared to be fine.Then came yesterday. The unit suddenly powered off, and I have not gotten it to turn back on since. I would open it up and tinker with it, but I'm pretty sure it's not worth my time."
2,Cheap and it shows,I used one of these routers at home to connect my desktop and laptop for basic file sharing. It does work ... sometimes. I often have to keep my laptop within six feet to get it to keep a connection. Pathetic. I wish that I had spent the extra money for Linksys.
3,Not Bad,"I was frustrated with this product at first, even after applying the firmware update. Connectivity came and went at a whim. I finally tripped across some advice online about changing to channel 5. Tried that and haven't had a problem since."
3,belkin ok,overall the product is above average. no major hiccups to complain about. installation was relatively esy. performance is not upto the mark when considering that my pc is just 10-20 ft away from the device. ok
4,Good product,"Good value for money. Worked right out of the box. Device management console is good. Easy to configure security settings etc. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I had to contact Belkin support once and my problem was resolved promptly by a friendly and knowledgeable service rep."
4,Double distance,"The router extender was linked to another Belkin, it took a short while to work out the set up (hint - turn off security to auto link) but now I get Wi-Fi all over the three stories of the house."
1,"OK Product, Horrible Service Department","Watch out, Belkin has moved tech help to India. Can't get to advanced tech help, must wait for a return call. I've been waiting over a week. No call. I bought another router from another manufacturer. Be forwarned."
3,Worked ok at first,"I have owned this for over a year. First year was fine. After that I started loosing signal for no reason. The only way to get it back was to do a hard reset. Im having to do it every two days. I've heard ppl say try changing the channel from auto to a static channel, that doesn't work, because mine has always been on a static channel and it is still doing it. Basically the router is done. Save yourself a headache and extra $$ and buy a good router or you will be shelling out even more $$ replacing this one every year."
2,Connection Issues,"There are times where the router works fine for days at a time. Then all of a sudden there are phases in which it disconnects my connection every 5, 10, or 15 minutes at a time (I know because I check the clock every time it disconnects me). When such an episode happens, it lasts for a good few hours at a time, and im on my computer for hours a day so you can see how annoying and frustrating it can be when you have to reset your router every 10 minutes. (Connection issues happen frequently around once every week). I do not recommend for people who constantly use their wireless internet."
2,Belkin wireless router,"One year ago, 03/2010, I was happy and was able to get wireless internet service but was unsure of which router to purchase, this product was recommended to me. WHAT A MISTAKE! I did nothing but complain on how my ""dial-up"" was faster and thought it was my computer. This March 2011 had a FOURTH (4) computer technician check it out and surmised the router was defective! Problems were solved after I had purchased another router, now I can see how nice an experience fast internet is. Hope no one else has to go through the headaches and expense I encountered."
3,"Like it, but...","I agree with most other reviews. It works well for what it says...but for some reason, no matter what I do it doesn't work with firefox or AIM correctly.I have no idea what the problem is, but it's very inconvenient. I don't know about other people though. I might return it"
1,Do not buy - needs to be restarted every 6 hours,"We bought this router from Best Buy and it worked fine for 5-6 months but then it stopped working suddenly. We asked Belkin for a replacement (as the warranty was still valid). Belkin sent us a ""new"" router that is a royal pain. It works in spurts and needs to be restarted via a LAN cable from a specific Windows laptop every 6 hours. This is a ridiculous excuse for a router. Do not buy. We should have stuck to D-Link routers, our last router from D-Link was fantastic, it worked for 4 yrs inspite of hundreds of physical falls."
1,Don't think this is a router,"The basic functions work fine. Connecting to the internet, vpn, wireless, etc all work fine. Don't think you are buying a router though. I can't broadcast video traffic, send point to point video traffic or set up multiple client IP firewall rules. Tech support recommends updating the firmware which I did to no avail. Without routing functions, my free router (after rebates) isn't such a good deal. Oh yeah, I'm having trouble with the virtual server too. BTW, My old wireless router (Brand D) didn't have any of these problems."
3,"If your router always disconnects, this might fix it.","For a long time, I thought this router was a POS. I live in an apartment complex with lots of wireless activity going on, and I have multiple roommates that draw internet from this router all at the same time. The router would always ALWAYS!!! stop working and we would have to reset it to start using internet again.I went to Belkins website and there was actually a fix for it! All you have to do is change the channel to one of the fixed channels instead of ""Auto"".Here is the article... http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid;=F5D7230-4&aid;=2437&scid;=221Hope this helps. Other than that, it does the job. Settings are a bit confusing to set up at first but you can figure it out."
1,This router SUCKS!,"Do NOT buy this router! I never had any problems browsing online until I purchased this router. If you want to watch any videos, they will only load halfway. Half of the time you cannot even connect to the internet. Pages loading only partially are the norm when using this router. Don't waste your money on this product!"
1,Never Buy product,The worst product I have ever bought. It never worked. It could not pick the interenet connection for more than 5 seconds. This was the case when it was wired with just one laptop and soon after the installation was completed. I tried getting it resolved by calling the technical support for Belkin but as expected they were of no use. They directed me to talk to my internet service provider. I just kept shutting between Belkin support and internet provider with absolutely no success in getting the router work. I will never recommend it to anybody. It is just a wastage of money.
1,useless wirless router,did everything i was supposed to including changing my laptop and the router would not work. spoke to belkin techs(india) 3 times and finally returned the router to amazon.
1,doesnt; work,this item doesn't work i have to keep restarting it. i had to buy another brand new one I guess that is what I get for buying used electronics
2,The wireless on it is useless,"As a wired router it works fine, though the wireless radio in mine died after about a month. It still ""works"" sometimes, though usually anything that tries to connect to it will simply fail, sometimes locking the router up in the process. If you're not going to be using the wireless aspect of it, go for it, otherwise just buy a linksys."
3,Belkin Wireless G Router,"Although the device works as advertised, the install wizzard didn't (Mac OS X). It required a call to Belkin support to get the thing going."
3,Updating your firmware,"This router was very easy to install and get working, but after a week or so we could not connect to the wireless network anymore. A reset of the router solved the problem, but I figured I should update the firmware just to make sure that I was up to date. Lo and behold - the ""check for firmware updates"" button in the web interface of the router did not work, and it took me forever to find the belkin web page that has the latest firmware version for this router. It's at the page below:[...]After I upgraded to the latest firmware version, the ""check for firmware updates"" button in the web interface now works ;-/. Hey, they fixed something. That's a good sign."
5,So far so good,"Bought this and a DSL modem as a replacement for a 2Wire AT&T Yahoo modem/router combo that died. I've had it up and running for about a month and so far have one minor complaint. There is no stand to mount it vertically. I ended up hanging it on screws on the side of my computer desk. Other than that, setup was a breeze with the provided CD instructions. It connects any one of 3 laptops and one desktop in the house, anywhere in the house. I took a laptop about 90 feet away to the back corner of the yard and the connection worked fine. No drop outs or non-connections so far. It is well worth the $33 I paid for it."
1,Save yourself a headache and DON'T buy this,"This router has been an absolute nightmare since day one. I thought got a faulty one, so I even had Belkin send me a new one, which was just as bad. On average, I lose connection to the internet every 30-40 minutes. At least 10 times per day. Typically, it just needs a restart by unplugging it and repowering it, but now, that's not working anymore. I have spent hours on the phone with Belkin's technical support (thankfully, they are all very nice and somewhat helpful) and no one can tell me what's wrong with this piece of junk.Save yourself the time and frustration and DO NOT buy this product!"
2,Disconnect Problems,"I wanted to just echo what some of the other reviewers have said. When this router IS connected, signal strength is average and speed is decent. However, at least twice a day if not more, the router cuts out wireless to my laptop and desktop (set up elsewhere in the house). I have to go unplug the router, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in. It's annoying and makes me regret not looking at more reviews before making this purchase. I've heard the Apple Air Extreme has good reliability; that will be my next choice."
3,value for money; not a great of router when security is enabled,"This product is a value for money. But if you try to enable advanced security with 128Bit key, then the connection keeps getting dropped every few hours."
1,Cheap but Crap!,"!!!!ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED!!!! I would give ZERO stars if that would be possible. First it all went fine. The installation process is easy. After some time, though, the router just sporadically switches off the wireless connection. Sometimes after a couple of hours, sometimes every 5 minutes. The only thing you can do then is unplugging and re-plugging again to let it restart. That is a pain especially when you need continuous online access. I checked out on the web, but found no one offering a solution for that. Instead I found a couple of people having the same problems and couldn't fix it either. I am going to buy another one from a different company now."
1,Drops connection- horrible support,I've had this router for about 9 months now and it drops the connection about once every 2-3 days. Many times all the lights on the unit go dark. Remove the power plug and reinsert and it will work again for another 2-3 days. Belkin support has been no help and firmware upgrades don't work. Total piece of junk. Will be switching to Linksys.
1,"Worthless junk, no reliability",Using WPA this router drops connections every 15 minutes like clockwork on my MacBook and on my Netflix Roku player. I threw this in the trash and bought a Linksys which works perfectly.
1,The Worst,"This is as bad an electronic device I have ever owned (in over 40 years). I have a new Macbook with the older OS X. The Easy Install wizard did not work. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with Belkin--some of their representatives gave me one procedure; others a competely different procedure; others managed to reset some of my server settings (which took me over an hour on the phone with ATT to undo); another claimed the router was defective. A final rep. told me that everything the previous reps (level 1 reps) had told me was wrong. He set it up. It lasted two days. I managed to reset it. It lasted one day.I have no objection to receiving a defective product. But it should hardly have taken an entire afternoon dealing with various levels of Belkin to find this out.I will never buy another piece of Belkin equipment again, nor will I deal with the contradictory advice and claims made by their presumed support department."
1,Buy a router from someone that knows routers!,"This router works for one or two days and then drops its connection. Cycling the power is all that will clear it up, and in another day or two it happens again. As other reviewers have said, Support is no help, and firmware does nothing to help with the problem. Look around the internet and you'll see how many people can't get this router working well.Belkin makes good computer accessories, but do yourself a favor and spend a little extra up front on a wireless router with a name behind it like Linksys or D Link. The Linksys that replaced this Belkin has worked flawlessly, while the Belkin is collecting dust. I couldn't bring myself to give this headache to anyone else on Craigslist...."
4,Great Router for Both Windows and Mac,"I bought this router in July when my Siemens Speedstream wireless router somehow fried. To date, I have only had to restart the router a handful of times (all during electrical storms)and since I upgraded the firmware in September, I have had no restarts.The router works seemlessly with my G4 Mac with a Belkin PCI wireless card running 10.2.8 and my Windows XP laptop using a D-Link PCMCIA wireless card. The mac address filtering feature included in the router software is a very useful security feature for apartment building living and setting it up is very easy.I highly reccommend this product."
3,Does NOT work with Wii,"I've never had a problem with this router in over 2 years, until I bought a Nintendo Wii and tried to connect with the internet. The Wii will not connect to the net through this router. It is the only router listed on the ""incompatible routers"" list for the Wii, just my luck, lol. If you aren't planning on getting a Wii, it's an outstanding router. It has good signal throughout my entire house."
1,Lasted for four weeks.,"This product didn't come with the installment CD or the manual. When I finally got it to work, it worked great...for four weeks. Now it won't hold a wireless signal. I am looking for a replacement."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,Waste of money. I could be within 5 feet and not be able to get a signal. Customer support also had no idea of what to do. Spend a few more bucks and get the Linksys.
2,Failed after six monts,"The router set up easily, always appeared to warm to the touch, just failed after six months. Shortly before failing kept dropping wireless connection. Now even if hardwired the router actually makes the dsl connection drop"
2,Died in less than an hour,It died a quick death while I had their installation CD in my computer. Wouldn't power on anymore. Quality goods!
3,You get what you pay for...,"When wireless routers were first available, we purchased a Belkin and it was very disappointing. The main problem was that I would constantly lose wireless signal even if I was very close (20 feet or less) to the router.Several years later, I figured ""Hey routers must be better now"" so I purchased the Belkin 7230-4. Let me tell you I have the exact same problem. I have to reset the router constantly to get a signal, and it's driving me crazy. If you can afford the extra $20 to get a netgear or linksys, I recommend it! I'd avoid Belkin the next time I want to buy a router."
3,Works OK,"This product works OK, but similar to what I learned from reading other postings, it does not immediately recognize wireless laptops as easily as some other routers I have used due to the security configurations. Even after using a laptop on this system, it sometimes fails to reestablish connections in a rural area with no competing signals. Following their directions, I could not easily figure out how to reconfigure the security settings to fix the problem."
5,Good product,"This product is great for four reasons:- It's price is lower then other product on the market- It's size is small compared to other products- It does the job pretty well! I am using it as a Wired Switch and as a Wireless router using WEP 128. No disconnections- For Open Source lovers, this machine is supported by OpenWRT. So you can have fun with it!"
1,Not Vista Friendly,"Not only does Belkin not provide a Vista patch, I have more difficulty with the router than I'd ever imagine. It often drops my connection, which is only remedied by resetting the router. I'm also not able to set up a secure connection and am left open to others connecting without my permission. Would I recommend this product? Not for vista users planning on a wireless connection. It works fine for my desktop using a cable, but what's the point of going wireless if you need to manually connect for a steady connection?"
1,Constantly dropping signal,I need to do my part to bring the rating of this product down. It's horrible. Signal is constantly dropping (about every 20 minutes) and browsing speed is noticeably reduced. Returning this as soon as possible.
1,Very poor router Belkin F6D3230-4 wireless A+G router,"I have the Belkin F6D3230-4 wireless A+G router.This is an extremely poorly designed router. I purchased it because it was suppose to be Mac Compatible; however, the configuration HTTP doesn't work on any web browser but Interent Explorer (which by the way is no longer availble for the mac. Microsoft has dropped IE).The DHCP server randomly stops working and nothing but a factory reset will correct it.The ""Reload"" config doesn't work; therefore, after I have to factory reset to get the DHCP working I can't even reload my previous configuration, I have to manually re-enter everything!The customer service was of no help at all. I purchased this direct from Belkin but they still have not helped with me returning this terrible unit!"
5,Great gift!,Gave to my brother in law for Christmas and he loved it! Thanks for a great product and quick service!!!!
4,Great brass band music.,Combine great story telling and period music from the turn of the century (19th-20th) and you get the best brass band mix. Especially good if you remember seeing the concert.
3,"Good review, but only one island...","The book is great, has a lot of information about the Big Island, but that is it's shortcoming. Knowing that most trips to Hawaii are those to more than one island, the Lonely Planet book about the whole state would probably be more appropriate."
4,"Good, but there are better ones out there","We read 6 books on the Big Island before going there (I know, a little compulsive). This one is helpful, but really the only two books you need are: Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Adventure Guide Hawaii The Big Island (Hunter Travel Guides) by Bryan Fryklund & Jen Reeder. The Fryklund/Reeder book is absolutely jam-packed with information. The Doughty is also packed with info and will have a few things the Fryklund book doesn't have, but it's main attribute is that it is an absolute joy to read."
3,"Great photography, but a bit light on information","This book has beautiful pictures throughout. The reviews and amount of helpful information leave a bit to be desired though.I am used to guide books rating lots of different options for each category. This book seems to pick one (or at most a few) of any given activity (i.e. snorkeling trips, horseback rides, etc.). They reference their website where there may be much more information. I don't like this format. I want a book that I can take with me so I do not look at a computer while I am on vacation.The book has a lot of eco type excursions in comparison to other guides which is a plus if you are looking for that type of information.This guide is not geared toward a ""family vacation"" so if that is what you are after - look elsewhere."
5,Excellent travel guide,"I'm amazed at the amount of information they're able to pack into this handy sized book. Every page is packed with detailed descriptions of where to go, what do do, where to eat and where to stay. Guide is well layed out and filled with excellent pictures and graphics.A very high quality travel guide that's well worth the money."
3,"Exhaustive, but lacks value judgements","I prefer <i>Hawaii: The Big Island Revealed</i>, by Doughty and Friedman. The Lonely Planet guides seem to mention just about everything, but they generally fail to make value judgements, i.e., Restaurant X sucks or Beach Y is fantastic.If you have time to explore and to make mistakes, then this book is a good bet. It's pretty exhaustive, and you'd need a year to see *everything* listed. But if you have, say, only a week on the island (like 95% of visitors, I'm guessing) and can't afford to eat a crummy dinner, then I would recommend Doughty and Friedman's guide.Also, in general, I feel that this guide is geared more toward the hostel crowd, relative to Doughty and Friedman. Pizza parlors and other cheap diversions versus the best places, regardless of price."
3,Disappointment,"These are probably my favorite cookie. I was so excited when the box arrived. But the first package I pulled out was already open and half of the cookies were missing! Not knowing who or when, I threw the rest away. The next package was properly sealed, but the cookies were a crumbled mess. They still taste great, but if you are planning on serving them to anyone, it isn't going to work."
2,Melted Mess,once the cookies came they were a melted mess... I guess I shouldn't have expected anything less in the middle of summer!
4,The Latest Team Rocket Single,"This is the latest single to come out of Japan, and it's based on the popular ending from the fourth season of the show, ""Maemuki Roketto Dan"" or ""Positive Future Team Rocket"". There are only three tracks on this CD, which are Maemuki Roketto Dan, followed by a karaoke version then a DJ remix version, which is actually kind of odd. Unlike the other singles which came in special pocket sized cases, this mini-cd comes in a full sized case, though half as thick. The small booklet features tiny pictures of TR, some from episodes that haven't made it to the states yet, and comes with a sheet of stickers with the Team Rocket logo printed on them.There are no other extras to be found on the CD, and the CD clocks in at just under nine minutes. However, if you're a die-hard Team Rocket and Pokemon fan, it might be worth your money to get these catch tunes."
5,IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS,"I'LL MAKE THIS SHORT BUT SWEET.I'VE BEEN SHOOTING CAMERAS FOR 25 YEARS AND THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR STRENGTH, VERSATILITY AND COMFORT THAT YOU'LL FIND. THE PRICE IS VERY RIGHT ALSO."
4,"Nice camera strap, comfortable, a little difficult to maneuver","I replaced the stock strap on our Nikon with this and am mostly happy with it. The padding is comfortable, and the quick release feature is really convenient.Cons: I agree that it is more difficult to slide the camera forward since the suede padding sticks to clothing. I have to kind of lift the strap to move the camera to the front which takes an extra movement and can be a little annoying.All in all, though, I will continue to use it, and the pricing is just fine. If I had paid more, I might think about switching it up, but feel that the value is priced just right."
3,Ok but needs better straps,"I purchased this strap about a year ago to replace the factory strap. The padded neck strap is OK but not much better for comfort over the factory strap. The quick release connections are solid and I had no issues with that. Now the buckles that hold the mount straps to the camera are to wimpy. After a while they the ability to keep the strap tight and one would come loose, thank goodness for two mounting points. Anyways after each strap came loose several times I decided to use in on a light less expensive set of Steiner Binos.So watch the buckles, they will get loose on you."
3,Releasable Camera Strap,"Good enough design. No fear of camera coming loose from quick release on accident. Comfortable enough, too. Recommend for Pro cameras' weight."
3,The Almost-Ultimate Coffee-Table Book on Tugs,"Big. Gorgeous photos. A broad-brush treatment of tugboats by a wriiter who has done a lot of research. Highly recommended for the reader who is interested in learning something about tugboats. But not recommended for those that already know tugboating except those willing to accept the book's flaws. Too many errors and omissions. Photo captions are often incorrect or missing. Coverage of tugboats is spotty, emphasizing one company and missing much of what goes on in tugboating elsewhere in the world. I bought the book and like it in spite of its flaws, but wish it were better."
4,A Good Year for a Soundtrack,"This really was a delightful, upbeat, lighthearted movie wrapped in a beautiful package of ""Provence"" wrapping paper and the music accompany this film matches that upbeat gift with a soundtrack that is quirky and fun. Memories will come washing back over you from amazingly creative places! Covering classic crooning oldies from the U.S., a little bit of Country twang, classic Nilson Rock and Roll from England and wistfully playful French diddies, it's a feast for your ears and a banquet for retro memories! I find myself smiling every time I listen to it. A creatively odd and very pleasant blend of upbeat fun."
5,A Good Year,I already liked the music from having seen the film. I was impressed with the speed of delivery and indeed I thought the price was ok also.I love the convenience of Amazon for books and music.Gerry Smyth
4,Nice Mix,"Having seen the movie more than 20 or 30 times (one of my favorites!) I had to get the soundtrack. It's a good mix of the music from the movie, but it does leave out a couple of the best tracks."
1,ripped off,I ordered several items from different vendors. All were received within days except this item. I e-mailed the vendor but I never heard back from them. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible!!!
3,Only contains half the songs,"I agree with J. Tavernier about including more songs. While they only used a line or two from some songs in the movie, others, like Boum, were critical to the plot (and you leave the theater humming them). There are 28 songs listed in the credits. While this soundtrack also includes the key 3 songs written by Marc Streitenfeld for the movie (Max-a-Million, Le Coin Perdu, and Wisdom). However, only 12 of the other 28 songs appear. (See [...] for the full list.)A note about J. Tavernier's list, he includes ""40ft"" by Franz Ferdinand and ""Chances"" by Athlete which are not listed as appearing in the movie. Also. his list does not include two songs that do appear: ""No. 11 Final Du Deuxieme Acte"" by Jacques Offenback and ""2 Arabesques: NO. 1 Andantino con Moto"" by Claude Debussy.If you have iTunes or some other song manager, you might consider combining the missing songs with the songs from this album to make the double album this CD should have been."
5,A Family Favorite,"This is a fabulous collection of music. We have all enjoyed listening to it repeatedly and have ages 53, 48, 23, 19, and 16 [listens to it the most]."
3,A Good Year Soundtrack missing lots of favorites,"Ordered the soundtrack and immediately sent it back because many of the really good songs from the movie were omitted. I'll just have to watch the DVD a lot to enjoy that music, especially when Russell Crowe and Marilyn Cotillard are sitting at the outside cafe watching the movie and listening to the song being sung. I believe the song is called Boum...not on the soundtrack. I would rather have had that than Patti Paige."
3,Loved the Movie but don't know about soundtrack,Would have liked the soundtrack more if more songs from movie were on it.
4,mildly disappointed,"The soundtrack is missing a song that's important in the movie.... ""Hey Joe."" Had been looking forward to it... it's a fantastic song, in French, by Hallyday.Otherwise it's a great soundtrack. The movie is a favorite of mine (as are most Ridley Scott films) and it's nice having it evoked, especially by the original score. Miss Hey Joe tho; can't think why it's left out."
2,A good ear - spoiled,"While the music in A Good Year is appropriate and fun, the music on the CD cannot stand without the lines, the actors and the scene. Too bad."
5,Churchill DVD,"If you admire Winston Churchill then you'll certainly like this DVD. It is well put together with film footage, which would have been a very new medium back in his day, of various speeches and events. It is fascinating to watch his mannerisms during and after giving a speech. You gain such insight from watching him rather that only hearing or reading the speeches."
4,A great book,"The book was very eye opening. Where I had previously labeled my self as 'Co-dependent' I can now see where it is truly another addition of MINE in my life. I had felt almost a superiority in wearing the 'Co-dependent' hat, and can see after reading this book how it is a mask that was hiding my own addiction. Now I have to do the work.It was easy to read and very realistic - the examples were very helpful for me to see my own patterns in creating relationships. My favorite section began on page 103 "" The following are some of the skills used to form pseudo- (addictive) relationships.""... I am an expert at 9 out of 10 of the skills and previously thought that I was just a nice person, good friend, etc...Great book."
3,Keep working your program,"This book was helpful to me, although I felt the author was still working out her issues of control in her writing. The author spoke extensively about the 12 step program and how invaluable it was to recovery, but it seems that she is still stuck around two or three. Relinquishing self-will is vital to emotional development. Not only did the author try to suggest that polygamy was a much more acceptable and reasonable concept for relationships in the coming future, she refused to acknowledge God in her recitation of the twelve steps but instead chose to refer to him as a Process. Of course as an author she is entitled to write as she desires, but based on the topic on which she chose to write I was surprised at her single-minded desire to impose her views upon the reader, rather than offering the advice along with other alternatives and allowing the reader to decide"
4,Opened my eyes,Great book. I really learned a lot about myself in this book. It has helped me so much. The conditon was great as well.
4,Great book on codependency,"This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and i enjoyed reading it. I did not like the structure of the book so much, but the author provides really good material on Codependency and how to recover from it. The book does not flow very well from one chapter to another, but on the bright side, you can pretty much pick it up at any chapter and read it without feeling lost. Overall, I would recommend this book to people who struggle with codependency issues and especially issues of romance or relationship addiction."
4,An interesting view on the relationships,"I would reccomend to read this book to all people involved into any kind of relationships. It's not all Q&As but it's a real and logical view on many ""mystical"" things that we often shy away from."
5,Haco is so cool.,"Haco has been making remarkable experimental pop art music with After Dinner and doing live performances for some time now. This 1995 release is her solo debut, mostly in her native Japanese (with one track in English and a couple others featuring some English segments) but feeling like it came from some slightly happier planet. She's been fairly compared to Kate Bush, Bjork and Dagmar Krause, to that list of like-minded folks I'd like to add: Cibo Matto, Christine Baczewska, the Raincoats, Pamela Golden and Laurie Anderson. Accessible and challenging, this is pure dream pop magic in action. I love: Excellent Waves, Would You Like Some Mushrooms?, Ice, A Fragment, and Oil & Water...but really, there's not a bad track. Musicians include; Tsuneo Imahori, Tom Cora, and Samm Bennett (of Chunk and the Kropotkins)."
4,pacesetter,"A good product all together, unless you have the equipment I suggest taking it to a shop to have installed, They had to do some bending because it did not fit exactly, looks nice and sounds good though (deep tone, not raspy), gets a little better MPG."
2,A Sequel That Doesn't Live Up to the Original,"You could probably watch this movie a dozen times and still be unable to completely follow the story. For some reason the continuity and artistic merit that were present in the original ""Graveyard Shift"" are completely lost. The story is a bizarre tale of the return of Baisez, the vampire who was introduced and supposedly destroyed in the original movie. Baisez is doomed to walk the earth as a ghost-like being until he can find a body he can posses. Sounds simple enough but the story jumps all over the place, taking place on a movie set. The thread of continuity completely unravels through the course of the movie and by the end you are left completely unclear as to what exactly happened. The bizarre part is the movie is nonetheless interesting. I would only recommend it for diehard fans of the genre."
1,Product end user,"The design of this product is great, but it needs better quality control. It seen to be it was no quality test or inpection at all. I hose was leaking when I plug in to the hosebitt."
3,roll up hose review,The roll up flat hose is light and easy to use. After the first use I notice that the vinyl hose underneath the fabric netting of the hose started bulging through at the connection part. Except trying to tape it there is not much you can do and it could get worth.
1,"A ""Wet"" Disappointment","I was so looking forward to using the MintCraft Flat Garden Hose - light weight, easy to store, etc. I ordered it in early June and received it promptly. Not needing this hose at the time, I stored it in its original packaging. On July 30, six weeks after I received this hose, I attached it to the outdoor faucet, turned the faucet to ""on"" and found the hose leaked! Water was spraying from a hole in the middle of the hose. On July 30 I went on line to Amazon and learned that my ""window"" to return this faulty product had lapsed on July 17. I could return the faulty product - at my expense - and receive only a partial refund. I strongly caution any potential buyers. Forewarned is forearmed. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Rupurted Immedately,"I purchased this because I have had a Hydrohose for many years and I love it, but I needed to add to the length. It is a yellow one that my wife bought me on QVC. I could not find that one anymore on QVC or Amazon so I purchased this item. It arrived in perfect condition - no damage from shipping. A couple of days later I connected this hose to start using it - and it instantly rupurted! I returned it to Amazon (this is the first thing I have ever returned to Amazon in over 7 years). I then found the hydrohose I was originally was looking for a ActiveForever. I ordered it directly from them and got the exact same model that I already own and could not be happier - it is extremely durable and handy to use. Stay away from this hose - QC is low."
1,"Flat Hose Reel, 50'","Good morning, yesterday I received this product and install the hose is broken and the water bottle is large the gap is hugeI sent images to see the product that arrived damagedI hope your answerthanks"
1,Flat hose,"This hose does king uip, and is worst than the standard hose.. Don't waste your $$$ on this.."
1,Hose Reel,"The nozzle has multiple spray settings that change from mist, jet, center full, full and soak. All settings work very well.The hose must be straight otherwise no water because it kinks. The squeegie wind up is difficult and kinks. The cloth hose on mine (after 4 uses) has developed two holes.I would not buy this product again nor do I recommend it."
1,worst purchase ever,"started leaking almost immediately. taped each leak, then another popped up. also leaking where nozzle attaches. if we had kept packaging and receipt it would have been sent back. now it is going to the dump."
1,Early failure,I bought this hose to keep on our boat. I used it three times and everything worked fine. The forth time I hooked it up and turned on the water it blew out at the hose connection end. Is there any warranty on this?
2,Not Happy with Product Quality issues,"The green wrap around material seperated from the hose material inside and is causing kinks. The kinks are causing water flow problems. I used the reel after each use and still had issues. I was excited to see a flat hose and was looking forward to the quality, after using it I am disappointed. This manufacture makes me question their quality specs. This in my opinion failed and I will not suggest or buy it again."
1,always get the original,"I have been searching for a additional flat hose reel. this item looked acceptable, however when used the nylon sheath separated upon winding back into its real. so the last foot of the hose has a crumpled sheath that prevented the complete winding of the hose. The original is the ""Toro Compact Hose Reel System"". faithfully been using that item for over 25 years."
1,kinks,The hose kinked easily and busted inside with pressure. I want to return the hose. Wll you send a return slip please.
5,The basic founding documents of American democracy,"One can take two opposing approaches to this kind of volume. One can celebrate the treasures that are in it, or one can lament all the treasures it lacks. I prefer the first approach. For any volume which contains , The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, Washington's First Inaugural and Farewell Speeches, Lincoln's First and Second Inaugurals and the Gettysburg Address contains the very heart of America's political thought and creed.These documents are valuable not only politically, and historically they are also very great Literature.There is much to be inspired by in the documents that are in this volume .Those seeking more important documents relating to American political life and democracy can find other volumes, whole libraries if they wish.For what it is, this is just right."
5,Book,Teacher assignes reading out of it every nights the documents themselves are a little hard to understand but the book does a good job if outlining then .
3,Incomplete,"While having the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in one binding is convenient enough, it's what's omitted from this book--given the title--that is glaring and puzzling. Just one Federalist essay? There are 84 others, two or three of which are more important than Number 10. None of the Anti-Federalist papers? Not one? Nothing by Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Paine? None of the histories by Francis Parkman? I won't beat a dead horse."
1,The Declaration of Independence and Other Great Documents of American History 1775-1865 (Dover Thrift Editions),I never received this book. I'm hoping it was overlooked and will be sent soon.
4,not read yet,"i haven't read through this yet. i know the words, but can't say much of this book since i haven't used it yet.I did order a large reproduction on the Declaration of Independence for $7 here on Amazon, as well."
5,Essential book.,A must have book for every house. Has all the essential documents regarding U.S. rights and the U.S. constitution for a good understanding of the U.S. legislative system.
2,Still not sure how to work it... or maybe it just doesn't work,"I'm using this to melt embossing powder on rubber stamped images... but I still can't figure out exactly how to hold it so the heat heats right. Sometimes and on some powers it melts right away just like other guns I've used. But on others, it just doesn't seem to work. The powder doesn't melt fully and the image just wipes away, not being perm held there by melted powder.Could be user error, but hey, it's a heat gun. You point, and heat. How hard is that?Anyway, I wouldn't buy it again, and I'll probably end up replacing it.Also, the large circumference is annoying, both because it's harder to hold imho, but mostly because it won't fit nicely in my stamping drawer, which is just under 3"" high, like most stamping drawers are usually not that deep."
1,Don't buy it,This cover is terrible. It looks awful in person (very cheap construction) and doesn't fit the phone well. It is so tight that it frequently pushes all of the buttons (especially the ones on the side) and prevents the phone from closing.
1,Boring as HECK!,Don't waste your money! One of the guy didn't show anything. He might has well been fully clothed.
4,I thought this was a great CD.,"I first read about Frances Faye in an article written by the great pop music critic Gene Lees back in the 60's in the now defunct ""Stereo Review."" After reading his recommendations, I went out and bought the two GNP ""Caught in the Act"" albums Frances put out. They were enjoyable, although the sound left something to be desired. Here's the good news: you now get both records on one CD. And the sound is twice as good as it was on the records. France sounds like a musical version of Bea Arthur ---- a down and dirty saloon singing mama. I really like this CD, and highly recommend it along with Frances' other CD, ""Frances Faye Sings Folk Songs."
1,A loud mouthed talentless hack...,"She couldn't swing, or sing if her life depended on it. This CD is awful. She has a loud out of key big belting screechy voice. Here is some helpful consumer guidism. If the CD has the name Frances Faye on it don't buy it."
4,I would have loved to have caught this act!,Frances cut this one after her years at Bethlehem Records where she cut her best tracks. This album catches her live and it gives you a glimpse of what a truly funny and entertaining performer she was. Frances' voice is better than many of her peers from the era and she sings as though she's lived the songs. My Mom first turned me on to Frances Faye in the 80s when she gave me three of her old records. The Bethlehem era ones are all long out of print and worth the money if you can find them. It's a shame more of her stuff hasn't been released; hopefully this is a start.
5,Electile Dysfunction Puts it Mildly,"I did not get to read this till way after the election and for that I am glad. This Swami is brilliant with word play and has me laughing out loud on almost every page (no easy feat). Also beneath the phenomenal humor is a sad truth, we have had out country stolen and we don't seem to know it (by the outcome of the election this is obvious). You don't need to know politics or care who is doing what, you need to like laughter, genius and living on this planet! I bought all of his books and am I glad! If laughter is the best medicine I am HEALED!"
4,They're Tasty!,"I try to generally follow a low-carb lifestyle and eat as much whole food as I can but every so often I crave something that just seems bad for you. I could easily grab a small bag of chips at the neighborhood bodega but there is a store only two miles away that sells these tasty treats which satisfy my cravings without leaving me feeling like I've totally blown my diet. At 12 net grams of carbohydrates per serving (and there are 3+ servings in the bag) they're certainly not low-carb, but they also don't have a lot of the additives or MSG that many chips have. Honestly, I would have given them 5 stars had they not used GMO corn oil because I really like them."
5,yummy snack,This is one of the best snacks to come along in a long time! I have shared them with people at work and am sending bags to my Grandkids for Christmas!
4,Easy way to get veggies into my 2 year old,"My son loves these, but they can be expensive. Getting them from amazon is much less expensive- especially since my son can go through a bag a day (and there's actually peas in there!) I have to say that they are a love 'em or hate 'em kind of thing. They have a crispy cheese puff texture, with a salty pea flavor. My advice would be to get a bag from a ""natural"" type grocery store first before you invest in a dozen."
5,Oh my!,I tried this product at a friend's house and immediately went home to order a case of them! They are delicious and healthy too!
2,Not what I expected,"I, too, thought these would be dried snap peas. Boy, was I wrong. The picture on the front of the bag is VERY misleading...when you actually get a look at the product inside the bag, there are no visible ""pods"" on the snapea crisps. The crisps are actually more like sad, green Cheetos. At this point, I'd rather eat some Cheetos...at least they have some flavor. These snapea crisps (original flavor) are on the bland side...even after adding salt to them, they still weren't very flavorful. They also left my hands greasy. I thought I might be able to keep a bag of these in my desk at work to eat as a healthy snack, but I have reconsidered. The crisps don't seem like much of a health food at all. If I want to eat something with 6g of fat per serving, I'd rather go with chips and salsa or a handful of pretzels."
2,Snapea Crisps use GMO's,"I bought these for the first time today. I thought they were going to be actual baked or fried snapea crisps - didn't realize they add rice to them. Also, they use GMO corn oil. This will be the last time I buy these, and will spread the word."
2,JUST NOT FOR ME!,"OK...They kinda grew on me but you can only have so many...(I don't eat muchgreasy snack food, Thats problly why) They kinda taste like a bland ""Cheeto""with a slight PEA kick to them. They are puffed like a ""Cheeto"" as well.I havn't tried them in a salad as a substitute for Croutons. That might be good!"
4,I dig..,"ahem, ok.. four stars because I didn't fall to the floor in ecstasy or nada. but anywhoo.. Whilst buying these green bean thingies.. I thought they would taste COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I thought I had them before. haha I was wrong. The first ""chip"" is like wtf? I didn't even taste it? & then your saliva does it's thang and you want another. The next one is like hmm. ok, let me taste one more to make sure my findings are correct.. everyone in my family likes these. All agree, don't judge by the first nibble :) half a bag is 130 or so calories. Me and my friend ate a bag together while we were playing video games and pretty fast xp so try em!! I recommend. oh PS.. I got the original flavor. In case you were wondering."
3,They're okay,Delivery and packaging were efficient and timely. I shouldn't have bought such a big box of them since I think they're just ok. I had never tried them before but wanted to give it a go. They are ok but these won't become a daily snack for me. I'm going to try to give away the other bags.
2,regret product,I was disappointed in the product. I would not recommend or buy this product again. I threw out the product. It didn't taste good.
2,Not Tasty,I bought these because I was looking for a crispy low calorie snack to replace potato chips in my diet. THIS ISN'T IT! Although I like Caesar salad this doesn't even remotely taste like anything in one. I wish I hadn't bought an entire case of these. None of my friends like them either so I guess I'll just throw them out.
3,Tastes great at first.....then...,"The first few bags were great. Now I get sick just looking at them. Buy a few, but no more than that.Nick"
2,Not What They Advertise,"When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them."
