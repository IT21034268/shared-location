1,Bad Community College writing project,"This book was surprisingly bad--a real disappointment for me as I enjoyed two of his earlier novels, High Fidelity and About a Boy. As I neared the end of this novel I got the sense that it must have been an earlier work re-shuffled to meet a contractual obligation. In fact it seemed more like a low-budget writing class assignment: ""What would happen if four really dissimilar people found themselves together on a ledge, considering suicide? Explore and expand."" Not worth your time."
5,"beautiful, hilarious, bitchin rad!",i loved every second of this and was satisfied all the way down to the last page. horby is right on with every character's voice. its not so easy to write about suicide with such humor.
3,Background for a trip to Indonesia,"I heard this was a best seller in Indonesia. Since I am going in April, I thought I'd get some ""background"". It is comparable to some of the best selling stuff here in the US.....not worth the time. Maybe a good beach book!"
1,Waste of time,"Why? This is just some more of that horrible rap/rock that the music industry has been producingnon-stop for the past few years. The lyrics are meaningless and Fred Durst is a reckless moron.Listen to something with a little depth and meaning, like any of the following--White Stripes-And you will know us by the Trail of Dead-Spoon-Grandaddy-Wilco-The Shins-Nirvana-Pavement-Guided by Voices-Dismemberment Plan-Ted Leo & The Pharmacists-Radiohead-Stephen Malkmus-Walkmen-French Kicks-Weezer-Green Day-The Flaming Lips-Yo La Tengo-Sparklehorse-BRMC-Clinic................................I could go on.Anything but this trash."
2,It was ok.,"While the plot line is fine and dandy, the author leaves very little room for the reader to make his or her own conclusions. Instead, the story is written with too much contemplation by the main character. Granted some contemplation is fine, but the extent to which the main character takes it is too much. Also, it wouldn't be as bad if the the thoughts weren't so repetitive. This book has a feel of being puffed up, like a cat frizzled-up cat trying to frighten off an adversary. If one removed all the monotonous considerations of the main character, the telling of the plot could probably be done in one or two chapter-length segments. This is the type of book that I would tell a person that if they really wanted to read it, check it out from a library, don't buy it; similar to a movie that one only rent from a video store because it isn't worth having you own copy."
2,Content Crippled by Narrative,"I started reading this book and thought to myself ... this sounds like the writing of an ambitious 8th grader (I teach middle school). I'm often wanting to read literature that would be appealing to adolescents and I think this may be.. the topic of high school boys struggling to love in a conservative midwest town will ring true for many... but.... I have not read adolescent literature as poorly written - excessive exposition, repitition, triteness, and an overly melodramatic ending. Kudos to the metaphorical comparison of vampires and gay boys.... I'll use that one in my own discussions of what it must be like to be gay and young in american middle and high schools."
5,"good book, Mark","This is the first in a series that I really enjoyed reading. It wasn't the first one I read, and my only regret is that I didn't follow the chronology of the series. But they are very enjoyable regardless. I won't summarize the plot; there are several other reviews that do that. I'll just say that the characters are treated very sympathetically, and the two characters are the two alter egos of the author. Mark is his more physical side, Taylor his more sensitive side. Knowing that made it more enjoyable for me. A good book for every man or boy who feels a different kind of love."
2,Self-publishing example,"iUniverse does no editing, which is plain in this book. I'm glad to see there is an audience for Gay Fiction, too bad the commercial publishers don't invest in writers and editors to support us. Mark makes an effort in writing (characterization, motives, symbolism, etc.), but it feels rushed and unpolished.Subject matter - the same coming of age storyline. Good for young readers, but adults will find this a rehash of other books. At least, he doesn't take us down the ""boys' school teacher/student"" lane again. I'm glad he uses two students.Overall, (excusing the typos of a self-publisher), about the same quality as what makes it from St. Martins, Haworth, Alyson, and Kensington.I want something new, something different. Does anyone have grown-up stories to tell? New York are you listening?"
4,So eagerly written...,"As some reviewers pointed out, a narration here by the protagonist (Mark) is actually so repetitive. Even so, there is such an eagerness in his writing. IMHO, these repetitiveness and eagerness make this novel as if it were really written by the protagonist who is an eighteen-year-old boy. I liked that."
1,Puerile drivel,"If you had given a writing assignment to a group 16 year olds at the gay and lesbian youth shelter, this would be the result. By the time you get to the last chapter (which doesn't take too long given how thin the story is) you can just imagine that the semester was over and the class had to come up with an ending....and did.I suppose it might be possible that the author actually INTENDED to make this seem like it was written by someone about 18...but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable."
3,The plot does it all,"Because I am an 18 year old highschool guy, (not a jock however) the theme and plot were very attractive for me to read. I could understand the pain and desperateness of the main-charactre, but was distracted by all the grammatical errors and repeatings of words or statements. I felt the book wasn't written the right way. It should have been more ellegant and poetical. Although I'm not the best of critizizers, I do think that the writer was a bit hurried when he wrote Ancient Prejudice.... It's not all that bad, and still can be enjoyed, but don't get carried away by the theme or/and plot. There is something good to be found. The conclusion is very interesting. I do have a suspicion. The writer may have written the book in such a rush-style on purpose, so that the story seemed more real, as Mark, the main-charactre should have written it. ...."
5,"Yes, It Is R & J","I'm pretty sure that Shakespeare wouldn't mind being borrowed for this one a bit. At least this time, the story line is closer to the Bard's intent of forbidden love.What is remarkable about this book is how easily it is inserted later into the plot of ""Someone Is Watching."" The struggle of carrying on an affair in high school comes through. Mark Roeder captures the fear and uncertainty of ple being fenied a perfect fit by everybody around them.I only wish it was possible to do Shakespeare one better. In some ways I still liked it more than the original."
2,Very disappointing.,"A cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this book. The reviews were wonderful, so I gave it a shot. I have painfully read the first seven chapters but cannot read anymore...This story just runs in circles. It appears the writer was informed by the publisher that the book was not long enough so he had to add lots of filler to get it to 181 pages. The author repeats himself over and over again.Sorry I cannot join you in your praise with this one. I have removed other books by Mark Roeder from my wish list."
2,bittersweet but redundant,"This book has all the requisite elements for a good Shakespearean tragedy. While the love story tugs at the heartstrings (pardon the cliche), the presentation could've been better. I completely agree with the previous reviewer with regard to the amount of introspection that pretty much makes up most of the book. It's overly used, and with the point of view being in the first person, it's almost like character empathy's being forced down your throat with the redundancies that constitute these reflections. I found myself being forced to skip entire passages as they tend to have that ""haven't I seen this before?"" quality in them. Some distance from the main character could've helped this book stir up more sympathy from this reader."
4,does a perfect job of downloading pictures,I own canon cameras which have both sandisk chips and compact flash chips and this item workes perfect to download picture off of them and it takes up such a small space that it makes it convenient.
1,Does not read MS Pro sticks!,"The Amazon description says (or used to say) that this unit reads MS Pro sticks, but it does not. It reads the Duo, but not the full size Pro (what's up with that??). Amazon provided a full refund. Thanks for standing behind what you sell, Amazon! (5 stars to Amazon (other than the incorrect product description), 1 star to the product)."
5,Sandisk Extreme USB 2.0 Reader,Very good product. Installed very easy and works great. Another plus to having a reader is that it takes the wear of downloading what is on the chip off of the camera. I was told that downloading from the camera does put considerable wear on the camera. I do not know if this is true but why not take any additional load off the camera.
5,THE reader for those RAW files,"I started shooting RAW format and quickly fill up the 4 GB cards...that's a lot of data to download. I have been using the Imagemate 12-in-1 and been very happy with it but now I need something a bit faster. This is the reader I was looking for. It is quite attractive, a nice black rubberized square, compact, and fast. Plug it in, download..that easy. I pretty much only use the Sandisk Extreme CF cards so cannot say how it will work on other brands, but it is excellent with the Sandisk brand. This Extreme reader now lives in my camera bag as the small size makes it a great traveller also. Highly recommend."
5,Small and Fast...delivers as promised...I'd buy again,"I bought this to consolidate to one card reader for my camera's CF cards and Palm Treo's SD cards. The build quality is surprisingly good given that's it's just a card reader - even a rubber bottom so it stays put on your desk. But, it's fast and easy to use as expected. I have not noticed the quirk the other reviewer mentioned. I just plug it in, drag over some files and unplug - no problems - system (XPpro SP2)recognizes the reader quickly. I should mention that I'm also using Sandisk media because that's what I already had - and they've been consistently good for years."
4,Must Use Supplied Cable,"The reader works fine. However, for some strange reason you MUST use the supplied USB cable. Other cables won't work."
4,"Fast, but flawed.","This card reader is very fast - especially with Sandisk cards. I tried using this reader with a USB cable I already had on my computer (for my iAudio U2) and the drive would suddenly not be recognized in the middle of transferring photos, causing the photo it was currently transferring to be corrupted with no way to restore it.After a couple times of that, I started copying instead of moving the files to my drive, and then decided to plug in the provided cable - problem solved.If you buy this card reader, you'll want to use the supplied cable, or at least test the reader with your preexisting cable, to ensure you don't lose value data in the transfer process."
5,Best Card Reader I Have Ever Had,"I have purchased three of these (work, home and as a gift for my mom) and they are great. I have an old 4x CF card and it downloaded 214MB of images in about 60 seconds. It also downloaded 200+ MB of images from a SanDisck Extreme III CF card in about 15 seconds.I think that it is well worth the $20 I paid for it."
5,"Unusual, Artsy, Framing Fun!","After explaining that she views framing as ""journaling for your walls,"" the author shows you unusual, unexpected, artsy ways to journal your life . . . on your walls! The book gives excellent ideas for framing anything from modern art to journal pages to antique flatware, with textures and colors as intriguing as the art they house. This will definitely inspire those with visual journals to Frame It!"
1,Wrong Bobby Brown,"I bought this album at an Swedish internet site, and thought it was Bobby Brown from New Edition, but I was wrong. This man sings New Age music, witch is not my style."
2,Plastic junk,"This is their Deluxe model and pretty expensive at that. I would not use the word sturdy for it. Countrary to the other review it is 100% plastic with the exception of the 2 slider rails. The mounting brackets are plastic, wich means you knock it under the desk and they are going to snap. The slider for the mouse is plastic and the mouse pad wobbles.Extremely dissapointed as I know in an office environment this things days are already numbered."
2,Sturdy but not ergonomic,"The tray is solid and sturdy enough, but the mouse pad sits a good two inches lower than the keyboard which causes strain on the arm/shoulder. It's not very ergonomic at all. I had to send it back after only two days use."
1,Bad choice,Just mounted my Fellowes Deluxe keyboard drawer and while I know other reviews referred to the not so sturdy mouse tray in fact it is so flimsy that I will not be using it. Spend the money and get a better unit.
5,Wonderful!,I liked the first one so much i bought second one for my wife's desk.Easy to install and sturdy.
4,good value,I have been using the keyboard drawer for a year now. The quality is much better than the drawer it replaced. The screws have remained tight and the drawer is pretty stable. The fabric on the mouse pad is a bit frayed but otherwise the shelf is in excellent shape.
4,"For the money, it does the job.","This keyboard drawer is definitely nothing special, but it does the job. The instructions are clear and you'll be able to install it quickly.It's adjustable also, so it can be used with keyboards that are a little larger than standard sized keyboards. You will need a drill and a screwdriver to install it. Make sure you're putting it exactly where you want it, because you're putting holes in your desk.The mousepad, as some reviewers have noted, is a little flimsy-feeling. It slides under the main keyboard drawer and it feels like you don't want to put a ton of weight on it (why you would, I don't know). There is also one of those big gel strips that goes under your wrists.Overall, a decent product. Nothing spectacular."
1,Horrible,"It has so many parts and pieces that you can forget to install this unless you are a professional, definitely not for women who want to do this fast and get going. The instructions are pitiful"
3,Serviceable,It works. It breaks after a few years though. And good luck keeping it clean; it's a pain to vacuum.
1,Mounting bracket broke during intsallation,One of the plastic mounting brackets broke near one of the screw holes during installation. The product broke before I even used it. Don't buy this. It will break.
1,Did not work for me,The desk that I had was more like a table.. that is it had a front piece that the keyboard would not come far enough down to accomidate. Was not able to use.
3,Keyboard Holder,"Although the item is very handy and sturdy, I found installing this item very confusing and difficult for the type of desk I have. The instructions are very poor to understand and need to be revised. I don't know what a standard desk size is, but for my desk I had to alter the attachment points so that it would fit under it. Essentially, I had to re-engineer the thing to make it symetrical with my desk. After I did all of this, I found the keyboard tray and mouse pad sturdy enough for my type of work, and I would buy another one if I had to."
3,Large keyboard,"Keyboard much too large for a 21"" deep desk and not much room behind operator's chair. It requires a 30"" desk at a minimum with space behind chair. Needed to be returned."
5,Good Value/Design. Pretty Sturdy Overall Except the Mouse Tray.,"After using and installing four different keyboard drawers previously, I decided to give this bargain a try. This my 5th keyboard drawer I have purchased and installed by myself. For the price, it's really a good product. And it's made in Taiwan, which makes better products like ones from Japan most of the time. It comes with a detailed and huge instruction paper that not just shows how to install it step by step, but it's also precisely printed with the full sized chart that allows users to drill the holes by using the positions/holes drawn on the paper. The only down side is the seemingly fragile mouse tray. It looks sturdy enough for some short term use if one's hand is not too heavy. For long term use, I doubt how long will the mouse tray stay in place and not become broken. Overall I'd like to give this product a five-star rating for it's good value/design."
4,Great for the momey,"Very sturdy keyboard tray, especially for the money! Installation is tedious, especially since the enclosed directions were terrible. Luckily, we figured it out, but Fellowes should instructions. Regardless, I am very pleased with purchase. Highly recommend!"
4,Instructions incomplete - correction,"Warning-- instructions incomplete.In order to get the 1/4"" screws to fit through the mounting brackets onto the rails, you must first make an adjustment to the mounting brackets lengthening all four of them by 1 hole. This will allow the tiny screws they supply you to go through the otherwise too thick bracket.Otherwise it works well."
2,Good for 6 months...,"I had this installed under my study desk, which is made of solid pine wood. It was really good when it was working, but it only worked for about 6 months before the front left portion of the tray's plastic snapped. Basically, what's left is the screws in my desk but a tray that's left with zero function under my desk. I have a very light Apple keyboard, plus I'm super petite, so it couldn't have been the weight.I will say it worked quite well for its price when it was working. I agree with the other user that the mouse part is kind of flimsy. Still in search for a roll-out keyboard tray now...."
1,Not worth it,"I've had the tray about four months and it's falling apart. The screws are falling out and the temporary repair probably won't hold for long. I would not buy this product again. The price was good, but when it falls apart with basic use, it's not worth it."
5,Great Value!,"Excellent keyboard for the money paid! I love the soft keyboard pad!-Pretty sturdy. Only complaint is that, they should have put a back to prevent my stuff from falling out from behind!"
4,Fellows Keyboard Drawer,The product arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.The mounting template made installation easy.There was only a little assembly of the drawer to do.The slide for the mouse I found to be a little weak and thin.Overall this was a good value.
4,Good keyboard,"The keyboard drawers came in great shape. One box did appear to have been opened and the keyboard drawer was already partially assembled. Other than that, no problem."
1,Not What its Advertised To Be...,"I was very disappointed when this book arrived I thought it was a Biblical dictionary,but it was anything but that. It seemed to a grammar dictionary. Thus far its collectingdust on my bookshelf. I wish I'd sent it back. I feel like I lost moneywhen I purchased this book."
1,Sold me a used item!,"I ordered a Thule fit kit for my Jetta, and it showed up nice and fast, but was missing 2 critical parts for the Jetta, and the other parts had wear marks on them. I.E. It was a used item and was resold without anyone looking to see if everything was in there. Now I have to find another and re-order. Most inconvenient.Doesn't even deserve 1 star.The only good side to this is that I returned to Amazon, and reordered another."
2,Maybe they are just not consistently good...,"I read all the reviews on this product before ordering. So many good reviews and so very few bad ones led me to believe that the bad ones were either too picky or had the misfortune to get a defective unit. I don't consider myself an unlucky person. The unit I purchased sounded good, but the microphone was very unresponsive. I wanted this headset mostly for use with Dialpad and PhoneFree to place Internet phone calls. I installed it correctly (it is not that hard to do) and placed calls using both services. The results were horrible. The parties I called could not hear me at all (though I even shouted at the mic which was set for maximum volume). I could hear them clearly, but that is of no use if they cannot hear me. The little microphone that came with my PC works a lot better (when I use a regular headset instead of the speakers). I am in the process of returning this product."
3,"Works, Sounds Good, but not a perfect fit","This is a great stereo mic headset that I purchased for the new version of half-life. I am very happy with them except for the fit. The plastic is too thin, so they don't grip my head very well. Besides that, they are great.Edit: They broke, and I'm not sure why. The mic stopped working. (yes, its still plugged in)."
4,Almost perfect!,"Works great for dail pad especially in reducing echo and other sounds...great noice cancellation and very light weight. I talk to my girlfriend for hours with this thing on and sometimes forget it is on! The only thing i did not like was that the volume adjustment did not work well and often ruined the sound quality, you have to have it set perfectly in order for it to work, maybe i just got a defective unit or something..but if you tape it in place it works fine. hence i did not give it a 5."
5,Best for the price!,"These headphones are easily the best that you can buy for the price. Not only are they very attractive, but they are comfortable to the point where you forget they are even on your head. The sound is good and the boom mic is very well designed. I love everything about this product, including the fact that it has a 3 meter cord. These headphones are even better than ones I have tried that are more expensive."
2,I am an animal for watching this...,"The premise of this film is good, but the actual movie isn't. It's more of a character study of a couple whose live spins out of control when they lose their daughter to some dangerous monster in the woods. I thought that the monster would be explained more, but I all I got was short glimpses of it. And the final scene of the movie IS the monster, where it is tracking down the ""big foot"" hunter guy who is deserting town. It's ok to watch, but the over hype by the ""official selections of this and that movie festivals"" caused the movie to actually be somewhat of a disappointment. I guess the film makers knew this wasn't a winner because the do an extra making of featurette on the DVD that is OVER an hour long! And most of the footage isn't actually dealing with the movie, but the crew and cast acting stupid and random. I would so rather watch ""The Final Patient"". I agree with the ""official selection"" tag on that one."
4,Guidebook very helpful,"My Sunday School class is studying CWG Book 1, and we are finding the guidebook helpful in discussing the concepts in the text. The only complaint I have is that there is not a page correlation between the text and the guidebook, at least that we have discovered so far, to know to which chapter the guidebook is referring. We are enjoying the study, however, and find it very stimulating for discussion."
4,Fun,"As I was reading I was laughing my lungs out. Really. This guy is ""talking"" to the Lord himself - The Creator of Everything, The Beginning and the End, The Alpha and Omega, like an old buddy with whom they're drinking beer together now and then. Ridiculous!And the Lord is trying to convince the author that He is the One as the famous character from the TV comedy series ""Allo, Allo"" - ""That's Me - God.""I give it 4 stars for making me laugh so much."
1,Blasphemy,"This book has nothing to do with Biblical teachings. So if you want to read a book of lies and false teachings, go ahead and order it. My advice...read the Bible...the true word of God. This isn't worth the paper it's written on and, sadly, will fool a lot of people who want the ""warm, fuzzy feeling"" of spirituality without acknowledging the true teachings of Jesus Christ. Without accepting the full truth, you might as well be an atheist."
1,Hilarious,"It's amazing what some people believe. This is basicallyblasphemy. The author's definitely inspired from something,but it's not God. And all of you so-called ""ministers"" thatare buying into this trash is mind-boggling.When the Bible says in 2 Tim.3:16 that God's Word is inspired by God, God was saying through Paul that it is God-breathed, that these words are actually God's Words to us of the salvation story. NO ONE since the conclusion of the writing of the books of the New Testament are inspired by God in the same way. No onecan write or speak today without fallacy or error. Those writers of the Bible wrote what God said to write without error or contradiction. Those words are life-changing words as no other writings are. They are living words from God's mouth."
5,Questions answered...,"This book answers most of the questions that you have had rolling around in your head your whole life. You know, those questions you've had since those days of Sunday School or Temple School... It doesn't matter what religion you are. God is God. Get this book, learn it, live it, love it, practice it! You will not be disappointed!"
3,Safe-T,This suggests that the unit stops when tipped over. it doesnt. Big concern. Otherwise it does a good job heating.
3,THEY FALSE ADVERTISE,"They false advertise with this statement, taken directly off amazon's description. ""NTK15 oscillating ceramic space heater offers a tip-over cut-off switch that turns the heater off if it's knocked over."" IT DOES NOT SHUT OFF WHEN TIP OVER!"
2,Animerica makes a great mag...,"But, the book isn't what I hoped. Although it does say ""Interviews."" I liked it enough to not sell it, I got to see into the minds of my fave manga artists! A must if your for the interviews, but it isn't a review of any series."
3,Good tool,Cut a bottle once under water and hole had chips and lost its edge at the end. Need to try a thinner based bottle.
4,Good finish.,"I was impressed by the first half of this series. The end of the first part was really powerful. The 2nd part starts off with Machina and Ouri trying to strengthen the tie of their contract. Machina has to resolve her feelings for the fallen Keisei, and Ouri has to hone his skills and prove his devotion to Machina. The Seven Stars play a huge part in the 2nd part of this series. They unleash their evil plan to change the world and Ouri and Machina have to stop them, but they are not alone. The chaos and passion hits the bursting point in the climax of this dark tale of loyalty and violence. It's a good finish to a great horror anime. If you like this series check out Shiki. I think it's better."
2,For Bloomfield completists only,"I bought this because I am a huge Mike Bloomfield fan and the soundtrack is by the Electric Flag, the group that Mike formed after leaving the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. I recognized going in that this was a soundtrack to a ""B"" movie. It may well have served its purpose in 1967 (when it was recorded) but history judges it less than kindly.The only track worth listening to is ""Fine Jung Thing"", which Mike lays some nice guitar work out on. That said, this album is hardly essential and is for Bloomfield completists/obsessionists only.As to its merits beyond Bloomfield and the rest of the Electric Flag, I'll leave that to others."
1,My Review!,"I WOULDN'T EVEN PUT ONE STAR FOR THIS! CURB, IF YOU DIDN,T WANT TO MASTER THE WHOLE ALBUM, WHY DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SINCE! CURB, YOU SUCK! Wait a minute here! Is that EMI again! Tower, and also Sidewalk Records, is a Sub from Capitol! NO WONDER! DAM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,What a Bummer,"The only song I could remember the name of from this album was a ""Thousand Year Old Man"" and it isn't even on here. What is the problem? This is ridiculous."
3,Spotty and Short,"I'm a fan of Bloomfield and the Electric Flag, so I wouldn't want to discourage readers from giving this recording a try. But I do want to warn potential buyers who might come to ""The Trip"" expecting something other than what they'll get: (1) This CD is very short, under a half hour; (2) Like Pink Floyd's soundtrack to ""More"" the CD gets all over the place stylistically, from bluesy tracks to tracks that sound rather like Floyd all the way to tracks that sound like psychedelic versions of 1920s tunes, and (3) You're not going to get the ""blues purist"" side of Bloomfield in this one. If you're OK with those three caveats, then perhaps you'll enjoy this album as one of the more soulful psychedelic recordings out there."
3,Where are the rest of the songs?,"I wanted this CD to avoid playing the record because it is collectable and for the better audio quality.I like most of the cuts on the record but my favorite song,Joint Passing,is missing from the CD as well as 6 or so other songs that appear on the record.I'm not sure if the missing songs are for licensing reasons or what but I was disappointed."
1,Fewer songs than vinyl,"I can't recall another CD with fewer tracks than the original vinyl. In spite of using the original vinyl cover, and advertising itself as the ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" this CD is missing one third of the original vinyl tracks and of the surviving tracks, one has the wrong title. Do NOT buy this CD, or any CDs, from Curb."
3,....BUT! Is it Mac friendly?,Nowhere in the ads does it indicate that they didn't bother formatting it for iMacs (and it says USB). I'm hoping they did because the reviews are pretty convincing! Too bad it's out of stock for now. Will post a more complete review when I get it.
4,Great for a dedicated chewer,"My dog loves to chew and is fairly destructive. Rawhides are great, but get very expensive after awhile. These bones last her a month or more. I don't know that they do all that much for her teeth, but if you are searching for something to keep your chewer occupied, this product is great!"
1,eh,"ehh, my dog ignores this. It doesnt really smell like chicken & bacon. Looks like this will be going in the garbage!"
3,eh',"I don't know if it's just my dogs or if these chews are not good. I know they don't smell like bacon or anything similar to doggy appetizing flavors. Neither of my dogs will chew these or even give more than quick sniff, before walking away without interest. :("
4,Amazing,"These chess pieces are amazing! They shipped very fast and came packaged with a small gift, as well as a hand written thank you note--along with an incentive to purchase future products from them. The chess pieces themselves look durable, but the felt pads will become loose over time with use so be prepared to have super glue on hand as well as extra felt pieces. Other than that, these are perfect. :)"
3,Looks cheap and found at Target for much cheaper price,"The print on the tags of the covers was already faded and chipped when I received this item. Also, I saw them at Target a week or two after I received mine for about 2/3 of the price."
4,Pretty good for outdoor stuff,"It is just a good decorating toy for outdoors. Its very flexible. it can stretch a very far way. The best thing is that it is very strong. So, good luck with them spiders!"
2,Hard to stretch and feels icky!,"I thought this would be a lot of fun -- glow in the dark and creepy and all -- but it was actually quite yucky. Even my kids didn't want to stretch it out around the house and bushes. It feels really gross -- sticky and scratchy at the same time -- and is incredibly hard to stretch out to make it look at all ""webby"". We ended up with thin areas and clumped areas and finally gave up making it look better because it feels so gross to keep touching it. Not going to repeat next Halloween! And you cannot pick it up and re-use it. Maybe I got a different variety from the other review that took hers home and re-used it. If you picked this up it was just a mess."
5,Warm Vanilla Goodness!!!,I bought this at a little shop in hollywood b/c I absolutely LOVE vanilla....but unfortunately so many scents smell too sugary and fake....not this one! This one is absolutely delicious. Buy it you won't regret it!
2,Not as fantastic as I'd hoped,"I've always been a big fan of L'Aromarine fragrances. Especially the sweeter scents like Mure Musc, Cola, etc. I was hoping Vanille would be just as yummy and become another favorite. Unfortunately, I found it to be cloying and artificial, identical to the fake aroma used in vanilla candles. After a couple of hours, I could no longer stand the smell, and scrubbed my skin to get it off. For that warm, ""sugar cookie"" fragrance that other reviewers talk about, I much prefer Pink Sugar by Aquolina. Pink Sugar is sweet (as the name promises), with a hint of vanilla, powder, and spun sugar. For a warm true vanilla fragrance, actual vanilla extract dabbed on the skin smells better to me than Vanille. Clearly lots of women love Vanille, but if you don't care for those vanilla-scented candles, this may not be your fragrance. I will still continue to buy L'Aromarine scents. They're usually quite unique and wonderful!"
2,Ouch!,"I must have more fragile skin than many others do. My home care nurses are using this to tape gauze sponges onto a slow-healing abdominal surgical incision once per day. It pulls hard, tears my skin sometimes, and leaves a sticky residue. I wish I could find something that works as good for me as the other reviewers say this works for them. On a more positive note, it IS breathable, flexible, easy to tear at the perforations, and has good skin and tape-to-tape adhesion. Maybe TOO good for me."
5,Great Product,This is exactly what I was looking for. I needed something to keep all my birthday's listed so I wouldnt forget anyone. This is a small compact book with plenty of room to list lots of birthdays. I would recommend this product.
1,Don't buy this product,"My daughter received this product for her bithday. She was very excited to begin reading with ""Reader Rabbit"". We could not upload the disks. I tried to call the user support number for technical support. This was an exercise in frustration as Broderbun has designed their phone tree so that you can not speak to a human nor get technical support. Their web site is equally un helpful. Recommend you look for another product for your kids."
1,Big disappointment,"This package contains 5 games that sound exciting and have familiar names such as Dr. Seuss, Arthur, and Blues Clues. Unfortunately, my kids (ages 4 and 6) were bored by most of the games, especially the Reader Rabbit ""game"", which spent more time talking to them than letting them do something. Arthur's Pet Chase was quite low-tech; it made the kids use arrow keys instead of the mouse. That was not at all intuitive to them, and they kept reaching for the mouse the whole time. Some of the games frustrated the kids because they weren't sure what to do. For example, if the player didn't touch the keyboard for a while, the game might urge the child to do something but did not tell him/her how to move. The Arthur game didn't even do that -- it just sat there. After a few sessions ended in tears, they lost interest entirely."
5,Beautiful modern day parable,"Terri Blackstock is one of my favorite authors so I jumped at the chance to review her new book ""Covenant Child.""Covenant Child is a modern-day parable that is a combination of the prodigal son and the story of Christ's covenant with us.Amanda's unfailing love, patience and watchfulness from afar is an incredible picture of Christ's love for us - his waiting for us to come and claim the inheritance that is ours for the taking.Lizzie is ready to claim her inheritance - to live with Amanda and learn the family business. Kara is leery - it's too easy and she doesn't trust Amanda. She wants to do things on her terms.It's a beautiful story and easy to see the parallels and remember God's covenant with us.I loved this story and you will to."
4,Covenant child,"I liked this very much and was hoping it was a series but , I read all terri's books and this one didn't disappoint."
3,don't remember,I will have to pull it out again and reread it. I enjoy Terri Blackstock's work but don't remember tis one.
4,Encouraging read.,"This is the story of salvation, a beautiful story of how Jesus is waiting for us to come to Him. Blackstock has written another fast paced page turning novel, I read it in one afternoon. A story of love, faith, trust, very encouraging.What the twins go through is absolutely heart breaking. Too much for anyone to have to go through. The grandparents are pure evil and then when Kara thinks she is leaving their filth and control she walks right into the arms of evil again. It's sad what she must endure before she opens her eyes to the truth.I received an ecopy of this book free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
5,Blackstock Does it Again!,"In the realm of Christian fiction, there are few writers that combine irony and symbolism with character and plot development well. Most can develop plots but not characters, while others develop characters but not plots.Terri Blackstock does all the above exceptionally well.Covenant Child is a stunning, modern-day portrait of Christ's relationship to us. Blackstock does an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life. Their struggles are real; the questions they raise are real; their responses are also real.This is one of Blackstock's finest."
4,Billionaire Babies grow up like paupers,"When three year old twins lose their mother and then their father, the result is all about money. The love of Amanda is so great but her frustrations are so many. Legal entanglements prevent her from fulfilling her promise to her husband. Evil grandparents neglect and abuse the twins while living off their money. Even though the twins suffer the same fate, they part ways over a very difficult decision. It costs both of them dearly.Written to take place in the south, about people and places which literally come alive, Blackstock did a great job of keeping the reader totally spellbound until the very end."
4,Terri Blackstock's Covenant Child- Review,"I really liked this novel. With 40 chapters accompanied with a reading group guide, this novel would be a great gift for many women in my family. When promises are made, they should be kept. I love that Terri Blackstock wrote a book that could speak to how many young ladies feel in life, when they are raised the way these twin sisters were. I would recommend this book for my friends, and have arranged to mail my copy to a family member.I received this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are my own, and may differ from your's."
4,Excellent!,"This was definitely an excellent score. The print is very large and easy to read despite the large orchestration for this piece. However, after seeing that Amazon.com also sells a combination score of both the 8th and 9th symphonies I realized that would have been a more efficient purchase on my part rather than purchasing both scores separately."
5,Symphony of a Thousand,"This work is by far my favorite that Mahler wrote. It is immense and moving and very complex. For anyone who is even slightly interested in classical music, this is the best piece by the master of the symphony."
5,A seinfeld fan must,"If you are a Seinfeld fan, this is a piece of memorabilia that you just have to own."
4,The Kramer,"I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I was speechless for words. Until now,that is. This poster is flat out hilarious!I love the show Seinfeld, and even more the character Kramer. Everyone and anyone who thinks Cosmo Kramer is funny will definitely want to get this; even if you have haven't seen the episode where it comes from. The only reason I'm giving this portrait a 4/5 is the fact people who don't like Kramer probably shouldn't get it. Now thats hard to imagine!"
4,Fantastic Fun and Full of Information,"Really great read, full of information, well-paced and accessible. She explains how to find wine you appreciate in what can be a very intimidating industry. I wouldn't normally bother to write a review of a book, but this was an impulse buy that I loved and the author really deserves a lot of credit for something so well written..."
4,The Pleasures of Wine,I've been a fan of Natalie MacLean's writing for years and this book does not disappoint. Natalie makes the experience of learning about wine fun and with this book shows that every glass can offer a unique and memorable experience.
5,Get into wine easily,"I love Natalie's approach at making wine approachable. She manages to capture a hint of the wine world without coming across as a snob. I think her stories will truly capture readers of all wine expertise levels (or for those that are just starting to read about wine!). This is one of her first books, and some of the events ARE a bit outdated. But they are fun read nonetheless."
5,"fantastic: engaging, witty and fascinating","Absolutely delightful... my fab wine book ever! Whether you're an expert or novice, you'll love it ... I loved the added chapter on food and wine pairing guidelines for veggies, chocolate, cheese, fast food and dessert"
5,Reading Now,"I am half way through Natalie's book and must say that it isboth enlightening and entertaining. Not only am I learning,I am smiling too! What could be better? Great Book!Her newsletter is also a wonderful littany of humor and knowledge."
5,Do your research!,"This album really is as good as the other reviewers have written. I've loved Robyn since before the Body Talk series, and I have been on a quest lately to complete my repertoire with whatever she's released. So, when I found out about this album, I immediately looked for it on Amazon.As of October 2012, a used copy is going for $130 and a new copy for almost $1,000? Really? I did some research on the web and found a used copy for $20!Now, how many more used copies out there are you going to find for $20? I don't know. But I do know that everyone should obviously be prudent when purchasing from Amazon. Do your research!"
1,HATED IT!!!!!,This was the worst toy i have ever tried!!! you would be better off by yourself. dont waste your money!
1,Packaging doesn't match the item,"I ordered this as I loved my original. But when I received this one, what is in the package is not what is shown here on the website or on the back of the package. The packaging shows the correct item with the single button on the front with the roller on the side to adjust the speed. What I received has 5 functions and no adjustment for speed.I would not order this as there is obviously no guarantee for what is actually in the package and Amazon won't accept returns on these product."
3,I like the other one that penthouse had before...Bring it back.,"I like the other one that penthouse had before...Bring it back.The power setting aren't what they used to be. I'm talking about with brand new batteries.Not when it's running out, right away. I have to throw out my batteries after one use."
1,do not buy this !! not the modle in the picture !!,do not buy this !! not the model in the picture !! the positive feedback is from 2008 when the product the person bought was the one shown.
1,Fail,This is not the same product as advertised in the picture it is completely different. This was my first time ordering from amazon and because of this experience I will NEVER order from this website again. It does not have a speed adjustment as seen in the picture and because amazon will not return this product I obviously wont be getting a refund for something I didnt order. Thank you for succeeding in selling me a product that was a complete misrepresentation of the actual item.
3,Older model pictured.,"I am satisfied with the value and the shipping service. However, this photo does not represent the model I received. I received what is I think the newer model I had already used one of the newer models before and I do not like the way the controller works as well as the older model pictured here. I was trying to get the one pictured. You should update your ad."
2,To Everything,I would say the book was only in fair condition- quite battered. It was a disappointment. My previous experiences have been more positive.
5,One and only,"If you drive horses, you will enjoy this book. There is no other like it. Not many left either. Get it while you can."
1,swirly trash,"these were so cheaply made that when I was trying to unpack them, getting one off of the stack- they broke!! we called the company and told them the problem. they must recognize how cheap they are, they told us to not bother sending them back. they just refunded our money and let us keep them. i still didn't bother using them"
5,These containers are great!,My storage containers and lids are always right where I need them. They make my cupboard much neater. The three sizes work so well for cut up veggies or leftovers.
2,Handy Gourmet swirl around food storage,Not to pleased with this item. Very cheap made! They leaked around the lids and also at the bottom on several of them. if the foods had any liquids at all it would leave rings in my fridge where it was sitting. Only good for thick stuff.
2,ok,cheap built. I bought one several years ago that was a good set. They have changed how they make them.
1,Do not even bother.....,"I ""had"" this product and I can not even say how disappointed I was with it! I liked the idea...the quality was non-exhistent. When I removed from freezer they broke! If you can't freeze in them, how do you think they do in a dishwasher? If your not suppose to use in the freezer, then they should put that in their advertizing."
5,Extremely convienent,"These are great for storing leftovers. This is our 2nd set. We slowly broke or lost several from the first set from years of use and abuse. The fact that all use the same lid is great. I don't even want to think about all of the time I have spent looking for the unique lid for other containers that we have (most of this before buying our first set of these). I will always go to these containsers first, and only use something else if it just won't fit in these containers, which doesn't happen that often."
3,Renovations guru,This item serves a purpose in a small cozy Kitchen. It consolidates the storage of containers that would typically cluster up other cabinets.
3,"I don't know what you mean by ""title""","My daughter really likes this product. It was a Christmas gift for her.I don't like to microwave in them, as suggested. It ""pits"" the container. I only use them for food storage and then put the food into a glass container to microwave."
2,Not up to standard,I bought this product a few years back and liked the way the storage containers fit in the refrigerator. I wanted to replace the ones that had not been returned. This product is not nearly as good as the first one. You can tell they scrimped on the plastic to save money and they are flimsy now.
2,the quality of these has gone way way downhill.,"As an owner of an original ""smart spin,"" I have to say that this is it's sad sad cousin.The opaqued, scratched up, tomato stained originals are lasting longer than the new ones. The new lids are too stiff. They don't stay on well. The plastic on the containers is visibly thinner. Guess I am done with these. :("
1,INFERIOR PLASTIC PRODUCT,I bought this product 6 years ago from a local store and really like using them in the kitchen. These replacments are NOT the same quality as before. The plastic is alot thinner and might not hold well in the dishwasher. Poor construction containers and lids. Not the same as before. I would not recommend this product.
3,Cheaper made version of my original,"I got this thinking it would supplement my existing supply of Swirl around food storage containers, some of which has cracked or met their demise in other ways after years of use. I was surprised at how thin these were and the lids do not fit all that well. I've already spilled gravy in my fridge when shifting one around and the lip popped off. the only thing these have going for them is the clever storage and 1 lid fits all theme."
1,Poor quality!,"Poor quality plastic and the lids don't fit on the containers, Read some reviews when they made a better quality product before it changed, that's why I bought them. Why did they change it?"
3,"Handy Gourmet Swirl Around Containers- They work, but.....","I needed to replace my original containers and ordered this set over a month ago. They seal okay, but the quality is not as good as the original design. The lids take a lot of effort to snap on, although, they do close up once you work at it enough.I liked the original set much better, but this is serviceable and okay for the price point."
3,Original Product Much Better,The 1st time I bought this product the containers were much sturdier - I was disappointed with the quality this time.
2,Cheaply made,Upon opening product we found that the large containers were stuck together so tightly that they could not be separated. After soaking in hot soapy water we were able to separate them but not before marking all containers and cracking one. Lids are difficult to attach to all size containers and seals are poor. Carousel is a bit difficult to assemble due to poor quality.I suppose the good points are that these are imported (guess from where) and arrived in a timely fashion.Do not recommend.
2,Misleading,"Well, I ordered this thinking it would be exactly what would help my mom organize her Tupperware. When I first glanced at the picture it looked like the perfect gift. I received it, opened it up and was very disappointed. The photo misleads the customer to think that the bowls are bigger than they look. I am very upset with this purchase and would not recommend this to anyone. What can you even put in the smallest bowl? 2 small scoops of peas? Lets be realistic this seems like it would work for a kids play kitchen."
4,Great Storage,"This is an add-on to an existing set I have had for about 2 years. I must agree with other reviewers that the lids do not fit well and are a struggle to get on tightly, even though they look the same. It seems the lids are slightly more rounded on the edges but the containers have a sharper edge or vice versa. Still I LOVE the compact storage though."
2,Swirl around Food Storage Containers Could be better,"I like the product idea but the tops don't fit all of the containers -- they are too small. I had this product before and the tops fit. I dont know what happened to it. The containers are pretty useless without a properly fitting lid. When I had the device before I found it to be very useful and it keeps kitchen clutter to a minimum. I wish the producer would correct the defect.It was also a nightmare to assemble. The so-called directions were worse than useless. I finally got it together by trial and error --and knowing from past experience what it was supposed to look like, but I can imagine it defeating even some mechanically minded people. I gave it two stars because it has potential, but it definitely needs work!I bought it through Amazon."
2,Piece of crap but I still use it,"This product is very flimsy. The lids don't stay on the container well and I have had several things spill. It's also hard to store the containers in their slots because the holding tray is so junky and won't stay in place. The little plastic guiders are not sturdy enough.I read the negative reviews saying the same thing (flimsy/crappy), and looked EVERYWHERE for the same concept but good quality. I couldn't find it. Seems like QVC used to sell one but not anymore. If you can find a better quality system, definitely buy that one.However, as much as this is crappy, I do like that it saves space and keeps things organized. I still use it although it is far from perfect."
1,Junk,just throw ur money out the window if u order this .. or go play the lottery!! ;)this is very poor quality and lids dont fit well.. 2 many pieces so just get lost around the house... idk.. not 4 me.. i think i tossed all of them awhile ago!
5,Best thing since sliced bread!,"Once you make the commitment to storing all left overs in one (or two, or three if one is not big enough) of these containers you will be amazed at the improvement in the organization of your refrigerator. Big ones stack on top of small ones and visa/versa.I like the fact they are freezable and the best part of all is that one lid fits all. No more hunting for the right lid."
5,space saver,I love this product because I am able to keep everything all in one place together plus it saves alot of cabinet space for other things
2,"Small, Smaller, and What Would I Ever Use THIS One For?","As the topic implies, they're just tiny. I wouldn't bother, and spend your money on a set that you can actually use for normal-sized portions."
2,New but NOT improved.,"My sister has had a set of these containers for years and I liked them for many reasons. They saved space and were of a good quality. The set I ordered and received was of a poor quality. All the materials were flimsy and difficult to assemble. The containers are thin and brittle. It is difficult to seal them due their poor quality. I am not going to throw them away but I wish they would have raised the price instead of ruining the quality. Great concept, poor execution."
2,disappointed,I bought this product to replace my old set. I found these to be of lesser quality. The plastic is much stiffer than the old the old was much more flexable. I guess time will tell
1,the lids break,the lids break way too easy and when they are all gone you have to buy the whole system again you cant just replace the lids. not worth the money
4,So Convenient,"I use these storage items in my motorcoach. They are very convenient and store compactly. They have lasted well for three years now. I love that all the lids fit all the boxes and they store compactly where I can find them. My only problem with them has been discoloration with tomato products. In re-heating things like spaghetti sauce, the plastic is now orange and speckled. Otherwise, I love them and hope the quality remains as I plan to order another set!"
1,Horrible,I have used these containers in the past when an old roommate brought them. When I moved out I decided to get some of my own because they worked so well. These were not of the same quality as ones I have seen before. One major problem is that the covers don't fit right. You have to try really hard to get them on and then the sides are bent in order for the cover to fit. Also I have had issues with the bottoms cracking after only being used once or twice.
1,Lids don't fit all sizes,"So, I bought this thing because it seemed like a good idea -- clean up the mess of lids and tupperware containers I had everywhere. The only problem is, the lids only fit the 8 oz. containers, NOT the medium or large containers. All you sit and do is struggle to get the lids to fit and they don't. Essentially, making this item worthless. Unless all you ever need to do is tote around 8 oz. items. Very disappointing."
1,What a disappointment,"I have bought two Smart Spins before. Although this looks like the smart spin, it is not. The containers are very thin, cheap and flimsy by comparison. You easily crush the containers when you try to put a lid on them. I'd be concerned about heating in them or washing in dishwasher."
1,Covers no good,"Wow, I'll join the ranks of the folks who had a set from earlier and bought this. The covers don't fit, period. You can feel that the way they molded the plastic is different from the set I got as a gift some years ago. Disappointment! The search continues."
5,Swirl Around Organizer,"I already had one organizer and since it takes up so little space, I decided to buy another. The best thing is that there is only one lid size and they fit every size container... no more hunting for the exact lid for a certain container."
1,Very poor quality,Cheap plastic. Every one of the small containers has a hole in it after only used 1 or 2 times. Very poor quality.
1,CHEAP,"Not made well like the original maker. Difficult to take the items apart, poorly fitting lids and they break easy. You are better off buying glad disposable..."
1,zero stars!!! TRASH.,All containers leak before even used. All lids don't fit. Ended up throwing them all out. DO NOT buy these containers. NO where near as good as the original version! TRASH
1,Not all items included,Ordered two sets of food storage containers. One set did not include all items. There were no small 8 ounce containers and lids in the box. The other set was complete. Buyer Beware: You too might be ripped off.
2,Too bad the new is worse than the original,"I am in the market for another set of these, since my X took the original set. The features I really liked was the pullout feature that appears to be missing in the new version: was very helpful for cabinet storage and now the feature is missing: guess I'll see what else is available."
1,Disappointing drop in quality,"I originally bought this product at Walmart a year ago and was delighted at the convenience of this system! Unfortunately, the current version fails to do its job.* Containers and lids are made out of noticeably cheaper material, not as sturdy.* Old lids do not fit on new containers* They are no longer leak proof and I've got daily spills in my kids' lunchbox!Bottom line, I pitched mine and am starting over."
3,not completely satisfied,"I still had some of the containers from my original set, which have lasted probably over 8-10yrs. The new containers are not of the same quality. The biggest complaint I have is with the lids. I have a struggle to get the lids to close on the containers. My old lids fit perfectly even on the new containers."
1,Don't buy this set!,I wasted my money on this set. Quality of the plastic is POORand the tops are cheap and don't fit well so don't waste yourmoney.
3,"Matching lids and bottoms are nice, but these don't feel like they'll last very long","The carousel is a nice touch. These fit well under our cabinet, and the sorting system means we can quickly put them away. These feel very thin and brittle, though. I can't imagine they'll last long if they take a tumble with anything in them."
1,Sad shame quality is no longer,"I have been ordering this same product for years, using them ourselves and giving them to our families. This last order was half the thickness of the ones left from former orders. It is a sad shame I can no longer order this brand from you (Wal-Mart still carries a quality brand). If all of your other vendors go this flimsy way, there will be no more need for Amazon. Hopefully, that won't happen!"
3,Good for the price but flimsy and cheap,"I bought this to help with portion control for my diet. It's quite a lot of containers for the price. The swivel set is handy and having the lids fit all the containers is great too.However, the quality of the carousel and containers are very cheap and flimsy. Two of the containers came cracked near the top. Many of the containers had an unclean edging from the seams made during the molding injection process that was not cleaned up. Just a reminder, they are NOT microwavable safe, so please don't microwave it. I try not to use it for foods that require heating. Some lids are not air tight and can leak.I use them to hold dry goods, veggies, pasta salads, salads, or other cold foods. Works fine for my uses, though the quality of the product definitely needs work."
2,Good idea but....,"Clever and useful idea, but the implementation is flawed. Interesting that the carousel is made well enough to have ball bearings, but the dividers are cheap and keep falling off, the lids don't fit without a HUGE struggle, and the containers have an irregular shape that makes it hard to scrape out the food. I wish someone would make a good quality version, as I would buy it!"
2,Cheap,These containers are cheaply made. Some of the lids don't fit on the containers. The storage rack is very chintzy and the spines that snap into the base won't stay put. The only redeeming feature on this piece of crap is that the rack swirls and also slides out so it easy to remove or replace containers & lids. The slide out feature would be very nice if this thing was a little better made. But I will admit the containers handle microwaving and the dishwasher (top shelf) just fine.
3,Decent,"I love this idea and had one from the container store years ago. This one is just a lot more flimsy. The containers are thin plastic, lids are kinda hard to get to fit on, the structure is really flimsy as well. Despite all that it still works and I use it all the time."
3,The Power of Infomercials!,"My husband and I had watched the infomercial on this product. We were sold; we thought it was a great idea. My husband especially liked the consistency of the containers rather than having an oddball assortment of containers and lids. And Tupperware is too expensive. I agree with the other reviews regarding the quality of the plastic, and the lids stay warped. However, the following features are positive: the organization is good; I love the twirl around feature; lids with the containers is handy; and 3 different sizes pretty much fits most of our storing needs. Use the top cleaning shelf of the dishwasher."
3,It's been changed,"I have an older model and thought this was the same. This one is thinner, a bit more difficult to get the lids on and off because the plastic is thinner - I would recommend getting one of the older ones. Also, there was a frame piece missing."
1,Poor quality,These were of terribly cheap quality. The plastic was so poorly made that it would crack and shatter just when you tried to put the lids on (which did not fit the containers). I was very disappointed in this product.
4,Wonderful product,"I am thrilled with the picture quality of this item. The tv itself weighs a ton, so be sure you have someone to put it where you want it, it won't be easy to move once put down. I've had it for a couple of years now, and am still very happy with it. No problems at all. I gave four stars only because of it's weight. But for the price, it's awesome."
3,Go ahead and move into the new millineum,"I used to work for Best Buy in the Home Theatre department. If there was one thing I hated was to see an old couple (Ages 68 on up) coming my way looking for a TV. I would always try and convince them to take a look at the new flat-panel TV's - but they would always walk toward this dinasour! Don't get me wrong, it has a good picture, decent sound, but there is one but! IT WEIGHS A FREAKIN' TON! OMG, it is so HEAVY!I Have a 50"" Sony XBR LCD and I move that thing with ease by myself. This thing you need a crane!Hey, if you want big and bulky - be my guest, but break down and spend a little extra and get a flat panel, save your energy for something more constructive."
1,What a heavy piece of junk,Seems to be the problem everywhere. I had this tv for 3 years and now it will not come on.I get the nine blinks. No more sonys in my future.
1,5 blink club,"How great. I'm in the magical 5 blink club, too.No picture. No sound.My Sony TV lasted 1 year, 11 months."
1,Defective Sony TV - Does not last 2 years,"This TV is clearly a defective model produced by Sony. In general, Sony TV's have been flawless - however this model has had a miserable quality record. With typical failures soon after warranty expires.In many cases Sony is refusing to acknowledge the quality issues and telling their cusotmers it is out of warranty and denying to fix the issue.Many users are complaining high enough up the chain, that Sony will resolve the problem at not cost to the customer. You need to get past the 1st level of Customer Service.Sony needs to re-evaulate how they are treating their customers - as Samsung is starting to eat their lunch. If this was a Samsung TV - Samsung would repair it at no cost or hassle to the customer, as they want to be #1 in the TV market..."
2,Worked for 4 years - but that's it?,"I purchased this Tv about 4 years ago and yes, the picture was good when it worked. This past year, the picture became very wavy and eventually the entire picture looked like an hourglass shape and never came back to normal. I had a tv guy at my house 6 times and he was never able to fix it. To spend $600 for a tv and to have it break after 4 years - that's insane. My grandmother still has her huge Zenith furniture tv after 25 years and it works perfectly. Sony, you are no longer the king of electronics - make way for Panasonic and Samsung who are now undercutting you for your business. those were the days my friends. Beware of this tv and sony products - they have foregone quality for cheap cost of parts and mass production."
2,"Great, if you don't end up with blinking lights","I bought this TV in 2005 or 2006 after our 11 yr old hand-me-down ProScan stopped working one day. This TV had pretty good picture, decent sound, it's frikken huge but it's a 32"" CRT so what do you expect. Ever since the first day we brought it home, it would make the loudest **bzzzoowwwn** sound when you turned it on and make all of the lights in the house dim for a sec. Other than that, it was perfect. Until... It started having the 9 blink problem within the past week or so. Periodically, it will just not turn on and the standby light blinks 9 times... and bummer for you, no TV. Now I learn via online searches that I have to replace the G Board for $60 to $100 (and that's if I do it myself) if I want my tv to work again.For the price I paid for this behemoth that many years ago, I can buy a pretty nice flat screen LCD tv, and hopefully I will not incur the wrath of the blinking lights again."
2,low quality,Mostly millet and sunflower seeds. Pretty low quality food. I thought it would be a good value for the price but this would be good for maybe pigeons or something..
5,works well and sets up easily,"I had the drive up and running on a PC running XP within 10 minutes. One note: for some reason, the drivers that automatically install from the CD are not 'certified' by Microsoft as able to run with XP, so the drive will not work until you install the appropriate drivers. However, this is not a big deal as those drivers are on the CD. So, you have to be able to find the drivers (which the instructions cite by name) on the CD and transfer them to your hard drive. Hardly seems to be a terrible thing (though, again, it's unclear why this is the case). Addtionally, if you have a FireWire port on your PC I would highly recommend using it as opposed to the USB 2.0 port, as I was getting data transfer rates of up to a quarter gigabyte per minute through Fire Wire (sustained rates averaged about 75 mb per minute).All in all a pretty impressive piece of engineering. The drive is also very quiet."
1,Lousy Unreliable Drive,"I bought a Maxtor 5000DV 120 GB drive and it worked well at first, but then one day I had an I/O error and lost everything on the hard drive. My whole music collection!! The Maxtor people were of NO HELP. I reformatted the disc, and it seems to work, but now I am afraid it will mess up again. SO I can't use it for anything important. A waste of money."
2,Poor Documentation,"I just got this thing out of the box, and it's taken a long time to get it up and running (running Max OS X 10.2.8)--this torques me off. Part of the reason I use Macs is because you can plug and play almost everything and not have to worry about stuff like this.The documentation did not accurately describe the messages and files that were on the CD, and even after reading through all of it, I had no success. Buried in Maxtor's support website (which is different from their knowledge base site for some reason) I found the article I needed: you've got to manually force the drive to reformat under 10.2. Very poor of Maxtor not to include this little tid-bit in their documentation.I think I'm going to send this drive back after reading all the awful reviews of this thing. Maxtor, if you're listening, you've got work to do."
2,"Short lifetime, but at least a graceful failure","On the plus side, it worked for a while. The drive never stops spinning, which is mildly annoying and probably wastes electricity and shortens the life.I used it for six months to store and edit home movies. Then, I didn't touch it much for another six months. Twelve months after purchase, I noticed that some files took a LONG LONG time to retrieve, three minutes instead of three seconds.Running dirchk -f improved the performance, although it takes about a full day. Lots of failed sectors repaired. Performance improves but then goes downhill again.I'm just past the warranty and can't get a replacement. Sigh.But, at least my data isn't LOST. It's just hard to get. I will probably retire it when I get a new drive."
1,160GB version failed within the first year,"I am very dissapointed that I lost my back-up data with this product. Within 6-months of use, it gave an I/O error one day. None of my data is accessiable. This was supposed to be used as a back-up device. If a back-up device is not reliable, you shouldn't spend a dime on it. I don't recommend this product."
2,DON'T buy this !,"I bought a 5000DV with 160gb storage capacity about two months ago. It crashed the same week I bought it. It had about 60gb of used data on it when it happened, so I got really mad. It has no power on/off button which is also very annoying. The support is really really bad. The only good thing here is that you can get a replacement in advance but the worse thing is that you'll have to pay for the shipping of the broken one. Which means alot to me since I live in Scandinavia and had to send it to Ireland. The shipping alone cost me almost 90$ american dollars ! The next time I buy something like this I'll avoid Maxtor. I DON'T recommend this product to anyone. Go buy from another brand, it will save you plenty."
2,It could have been five stars,"I have this drive for a few months and original impression was very positive. Installation was very easy, the use is very intuitive, etc. I am glad I didn't write review at that time. The reason is that my drive failed. It indicated that there is I/O error and although the drive was recognized by the system it didn't work. Well, I understand that everything can happen and just because my drive failed it doesn't necessarily mean that something wrong with the product in general. Roughly at the same time when I purchased this unit for home we bought three drives for work. Two of these three drives failed (with the same symptoms). To the benefit of Maxtor I should say that the replacement procedure was quite smooth and organized (but that could be because they have so much experience replacing faulty units). Anyway, when three out of four units fail something is definitely wrong. Two stars just because I still liked the unit (when it worked)"
1,"Nothing but trouble; unreliable, unpredictable, doesn't work",I've already had a warranty replacement from Maxtor and the new unit is just as unreliable. Major problems with i/o device errors when writing to it. Constantly having to reformat the drive (and lose all of the data on it). Lots of bad sectors found after it fails to finishing writing files to it. Not able to use it for backups because I can't be sure the data will be properly written and read back when needed. It's now just sitting next to my computer usused. What a waste of $299 (the price when I bought it). Problems also if you move it between computers with even slight version differences in operating systems.
1,damaged on arrival,"I was looking forward to getting my hands on this drive. I have an Athlon 1.4Ghz running W2K with 1 gb of ram.I did not have any problems installing the drive to my computer via firewire. However, when I tried to transfer some files from my computer to the drive, it began to make that dreaded clicking noise. It sounded like it was trying to locate a certain file on a platter going back and forth. It also made this annoying beeping sound. There were numerous error messages that popped up (e.g. Windows could not transfer the files to the drive). I tried again after shutting the computer down, but that didn't make any difference. I tried transferring the files without the backup software, but that didn't make a difference either.I am returning this drive to Amazon tomorrow."
2,"Maxtor makes a good drive, but...","their tech support is terrible. I bought a Maxtor external firewire drive when I was running Windows 98SE. When I experienced installation problems, tech support told me that I either didn't know what I was doing or that I had a bad drive. They (and I mean they) were downright arrogant about it. I returned the drive and bought a Western Digital external firewire drive. Same problem surfaced, but WD's tech support diagnosed the problem in about one minute and gave me the location on their site to download a software patch solution. They told me that the quirk was old news. Neither drive was defective, but Maxtor's service sure was. Five years later, I've learned a lot about PC innards and willingly buy Maxtor drives when the deal is right, but then, I'm no longer dependent on tech support and I assemble my own external drives for about half the price."
1,Failed under a month - but now working fine three years later,"Within a month of buying this drive, before I had to get it even half full, it spontaneously failed. It is no longer recognized as formatted and I have tried unsuccessfully to get my data back. It wasn't overworked either, as I hadn't even written any sector more than 3 times. Windows XP may have had something to do with it, but given what others have stated about failing, I believe this (and counterparts of other sizes) are junk. This review is for the 80 GB version. (January 16, 2004)After using Restorer2000 (great program by the way) to restore my hard drive, I have successfully used this drive without error for over two years. It appears my earlier pessimism was unjustified. (September 5, 2006)"
1,Don't buy Maxtor!,I bought three external drives in the last year and two died within the last 3 months. Avoid these drives if you want reliable backup.
1,User for 3 years and now it FAILS,"I've had this HDD with few to no problems for the last 3 years. The few problems were that I occassionally had trouble accessing the drive because the power cable was not ""fully"" in the socket. This means I had to ""wiggle"" the connector to make it work.This week, after 3 years, the drive decides not to work at all. It isn't being read by my machine even though the activity light goes off seemingly to say the HDD is doing something.Luckily I have all my data on a newer, larger, NONE Maxtor HDD so I'm safe for now.I've run into the ""wiggle"" issue with this newer HDD as well. I'm personally moving away from the HDD's with an external power source. At least the external drives that take power from a connection other than USB."
1,Bad drive,Died in 2 months. This is my second Maxtor drive to die. I will never buy from this company. Runs real hot. I stacked another drive on top of the Maxtor and the Maxtor actually melted the plastic of the second non Maxtor drive. This drive cannot be stacked.My second drive died in 5 months. This time I turned it off at nights so maybe it lasts a little longer.Still within my one year warranty. I am not sure if I will ask for another drive. Why bother with a new drive if it is unreliable? It's not worth the time wasted formating it.
1,"One page of information, 169 pages of meandering drivel","In short, he says to focus the voice in the mask (the nose and lip area), breath from the 'midsection' (or, abdomin, as most would call it...) and speak at your optimal pitch level. All the rest is Dr. Morton raging against the vocal establishment machine, and telling us how horrible most all ENT advice is.Save your money; I wish I had saved mine...Instead, see any of Patsy Rodenburg's books."
2,disappointing,In my opinion this book serves as one large advertisement for Dr. Cooper. It gives him a chance to toot his own horn. I would have found it much more useful had it provided a step by step progression of excercises to help people use their natural voice. Even had he let people know how to pick an appropriate voice clinician would have been nice. One good thing is that it does give hope to people with voice problems.
2,Not as useful as it sounds,"Frankly, I had high hope when I bought this book, hoping to change my voice and make it last longer. But the book is very disappointing offering only a couple of tips on finding the natural voice. The rest is just the author boasting his successful experiences in treating numerous patients. If you are looking for a real self-help book, you should look further."
1,Very disappointing,This book has only a couple of pages of useful information.It could of been more focused on solutions to voice problems.
5,Saved my job!,"This book was a miracle for me! Everything he said in the book was true, all the things I have been told about my voice. I felt like I was reading my life story. Yes, he spent some time talking about the establishment, but only when some of the advise did not make sense. I have already recommended this book or any other book from Dr Cooper to my friends, coworkers and family. He honestly saved my job because my voice was a huge issue in my reviews and termination was bound to happen. Now I know how to keep my voice healthy. Thanks Dr. Cooper!"
2,Easy listening,Nice rendition of classic 'pop' favorites. Good for brunch and parties where the people and food are more important than the background music.Other Nelson Riddle 'Best of...' albums are a better 'listen'.
4,"Ignore review from stapleton, NE","These are original versions of Nelson Riddle recordings from the 1950's and 60's. I was around then and we had a 45 rpm record of Lisbon Antigua. Yes, they are old recordings, sorry that reviewer didn't like them, but they ARE definitely Nelson Riddle."
1,don't be fooled,"Please don't base your opinion of Nelson Riddle on this cheaply orchestrated cd. I could be wrong, but I highly doubt that Nelson Riddle had anything to do with the arranging/conducting of this cd. If you want a great Riddle cd then check out ""The Wonder of You""."
2,Only two hit singles; only 10 total tunes,"Biggest disappointment is the lack of charted singles in his name. I took only one tune from this CD: ""Route 66 Theme"". ""Lisbon Antigua"" was a huge hit and can be found on several CD compilations.I thought the quality to be excellent for Route 66."
5,Fair warning: This is the size of a dime.,"Yes, this is the size of a dime. Its a small piece that was created as a commemorative, but also an experiment in manufacturing a $1 piece so that the Liberty Dollar would have a complete set of denominations (At the time a $5 half ounce piece was made as well, later a $5 quarter ounce and $10 half ounce pieces were made after silver rose over $10 an ounce.)So, fair warning, these pieces are small- 1/20th an ounce.IF you're looking for a bigger piece to show to others, please be sure to check out the 1ounce pieces."
5,it is such a great book,it is the best book in the world there is scary happy an dexcitting moments u have to read a copy
4,Watch what you are ordering!!,"Look out....you may not be getting the right parts!!! When I found a drip leak in the hot side of our B & K Laundry faucet, I was thrilled to find parts from ACE Hardware Outlet, an Amazon affilliate. Upon arrival of the faucet parts, I found the ACE replacement was not the one for my B & K laundry faucet, and therefore, would not fit. When I called Ace Hardware for the correct part, they advised the part shipped is the only one they have, so return the wrong part, at my expense. They would give me credit for the part cost less less a return assessment of 10 to 25%, but not the shipping. They advised they did not stock the replacement parts for my faucet.The picture in the advertisement does not allow one to see the parts themselves because the stocking label covers the parts to make them invisible.I am surprised the Amazon affiliate does not offer a more considerate settlement for an error made by their system!!!!"
1,"""No Magic""","There is no magic in this wand. What appeared to be a thin wooden Malfoy's Wand, turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic. My son was very disappointed. He used his own hard earned money to purchase this item."
1,Bad Magic,"I think it is magical. It looks like made of wood in the product photos but magically it changes to plastic after you buy it. Stay away from this, don't buy it."
2,Magic Wand,"I'm sorry to say, this purchase was a complete waste of money. The wand was really stupid looking and made a cheap material. It's really big and fat and I could never use it for a costume.DO NOT BUY THIS WAND."
3,His wand is as bad as his son's name,"It cheap, yes, but also plastic and overweight, for a wand (if you get my drift). Not as high-quality as others."
1,It's real.,"My God in heaven, what have I done. I ordered expecting it to be another cheap toy imported from China, but it was real. My God it was real. When I took it out of the box, wind started blowing and the Harry Potter theme started playing. The first thing I tried with it was ""Avada Kadavra"" on my mom. She's dead now. The Ministry is hunting me down. I don't know what they'll do to me when they catch me, as I didn't even read past the first Harry Potter book. This is my testament. Don't buy it. For the love of all things holy or whatever the hell Harry Potter worships, don't buy it. PLEASE DON'T BUY IT."
2,Cheap,This sucker is like a foot long and made of really cheap plastic. I would have been happier just not using it for a costume.
3,Not what the picture shows...,"For anyone who is planning on buying this because they want a good version of Draco's wand, don't waste your money. I didn't mind that it was plastic and over-sized. I didn't even mind that the paint kept chipping off a bit. No, what bothered me the most was the coloring. It wasn't accurate, which would be fine, but it wasn't even accurate for the picture on the box.That's right, the item you get is nto the item that is pictured on the box.It is still an okay wand overall, but very mediocre for Draco's wand. If you need something cheap and fast, it'll do. Otherwise, look elsewhere if you really care about the appearance and accuracy of the wand.(I copied this review from my review of the same comany's wand for Harry, because the problems are the same.)"
4,Great Book!,"Had some time on my hands while I had the flu- it was a great story line, well written. It kept my attention from start to finish. A romance set in Ireland with heartwarming characters. Bought the second and the third in the series! Just wish they were longer."
3,Maggie my girl,"The story of Maggie Mulligan (Sinead?) and Nick (Festus?) Desmond follows the same pattern and premises of Book 1. Paranormal? or just Irish?, it certainly resolves all remnants of the centuries-long curse on Black Castle and the Aidan Mulligan clan. Again I would remove the graphic sexual scenes and actually, in my opinion, strengthen the book's story line and certainly make it more acceptable to many readers."
4,Great taste and cheap.,"It's great for the days when you're too lazy to buy food or short on funds. I eat it with rice and some side dishes, as a snack, and in dishes. Overall, great taste with some hot sauce and you can store it for a while. In fact, I still have some left and it's as good as the day I received it."
2,Watch out! Not the originals,"This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the Decca/MCA ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Ernest Tubb Story"" were pretty good...but this album is for completists only."
1,Not good quality,Very disappointed in this the quality does not match the price at all. DO NOT recommend to others.
1,Poor Design,I've had a set of these phones for a month now. The design appeared to be just what I needed for exercising and listening to the TV. But the phones perform very poorly. Audio begins cutting in and out when ever I'm greater than 10 feet away from the transmitter or when ever line of sight is broken. Shame on Sony for putting such a lame product in the market. Mine are going back as soon as I find a phone line to Sony that someone will answer.
1,Disappoined,"I purchased a pair of these, and returned then within two days. The sound seemed poor, and I received some static even after changing channels. I suppose its possible I had a bad unit, but I didn't bother exchanging them for another."
2,It depends on how you use them.,"I purchased these headphones 3 days ago and had a mixed experience. I was hoping to connect them to my AV system to be able to listen to both my television and my CD player. The results with the CD player were horrible. Even in the same room, one channel would drop out, then come back depending how I held my head. If I raised my arm, I would lose a channel. These headphones don't appear to be ready for CD players yet.On the other hand, when I use them to listen to my television, the result is satisfactory. I suspect the same drop outs exist, but they are not nearly as noticable with dialog as they are with music. Since I primarily bought them to listen to the TV, I plan to keep them. The sound isn't as good as wired headphones, but they work well enough throughout my house."
2,Decent headphones plauged with a few big flaws.,For a long time I thought these were really good headphones but I eventually got sick of them because they wore out the batteries too fast.That was the only really big flaw.When the batteries were new the headphones sounded clear and sharp but only a week or two later they needed new batteries.These are like the Sega Game Gear of headphones. In other words they are battery hogs.Like I mentioned before I got sick of them for this reason and not having very much money I bought a 30 dollar pair of Sony headphones that werent wireless. I was glad I bought those.They dont take batteries and the sound is just as clear with plenty of bass.Plus convenient volume control.Those were a true bargain over these ones.I say stick with the wired ones they stay in focus and dont require batteries and if you get good ones like I did youll be much happier.Thanks for the time.
5,Very unusual.Really good for the money.,There's a very strange thing I found out about this product.Its that it sounds a lot better on my cheap Koss stereo than my expensive Sony one.The headphones and the bass boost option on the inexpensive Koss stereo work great together.This is really strange.I guess since these headphones are around 100 dollars they are meant to be used on stereos around 100 dollars.The only problem I had was that I couldnt leave my bedroom.Everything else is fine.
4,Reality check for those involved with Christmas Pageants,This is the best story ever. Anyone who has particiapated in the Christmas pageant chaos will find it reassuring that their activity is not the only one with problems.I saw this video many years ago and hoped it was out on DVD. It is still not out. I am willing to wait but hope it is out before next year.
5,Great movie!,"I just love this movie. My family has watched it every year since I was a little kid. Our old ""taped from TV"" video tape was getting worn out so I purchased this here. It is perfect for keeping the memories alive for a new generation."
4,Great Christmas Movie,"I read the book, I saw the movie, I read the book, I saw the movie. I guess I will continue doing this every year. It should be in everyone's collection of Holiday movies. Those little kids are so great and my favorite line is 'this will be the first Christmas Pagent where Mary runs off with baby Jesus. Full of laughter and tears. Highly recommended."
5,A Must Have Christmas DVD,"The movie arrived before the promised date, and it was very well packaged. The DVD is exactly what I had remembered from television(without the commercials). This will be one of our annual Christmas movies to watch with the kids and grands."
5,Fun Fun!,"This movie is just like I remember it!! Yes it is ""old school"" but look when it was made! It still has the same great message."
2,Best Christmas Pageant Ever,"It lives up to it's name. In a world where the meaning of Christmas is so misunderstood, this story is easily read and so potent in simple, easy to read language. Adults and children alike love it."
3,BCPE DVD,Every year my class reads this book for a book study. It was nice being able to show them how the book and movie are different and similar. I'd recommend.
5,One of the best Christmas videos ever!,"I first saw this movie on tv years ago -- ""taped"" it when VCRS let you choose 2, 4, or 6-hour mode -- and was dismayed when the tape didn't play on more modern VCRs. I was thrilled to find it on DVD, and bought 2 copies for my future grandchildren! It still reminds viewers of the true meaning of Christmas -- LOVE it!"
5,Oh My - what do I say about this story,"It was only a year ago that I was introduced to the book by same title. I read it and then bought copies to give to closest friends for Christmas last year. For me the story seems to have gone deeper than it did for most of my friends. Even though they all enjoyed reading it and sharing their copies, I seem to have viewed the ""spiritual"" state of the church at a different level than most. At any rate, this year, the local college drama department presented the play and then I found the dvd and purchased copies for my children to share with their families. The dvd follows the story excactly and almost word for word."
5,Love this t.v. movie!,I watched this as a child and loved it! Wanted to let my kids watch it after reading the book. They enjoyed it and it was a good quality dvd that we received.
3,"Good story, not very good video quality","I realize this was originally a made-for-tv movie, so I assumed that the quality wouldn't not be very good. It was actually poorer than I expected, but I still enjoyed the story. I had seen it before many years ago, so I knew that I would like it."
5,Good,This item came on time and in good shape- it's a classic that I will share with my classroom for years to come.
1,Bad Egg,"This thing ruined my microwave on the first use! It has metal in it, and the manufacturer HAS NOT gotten around the bad combo of metal in a microwave. Now, I have to buy a new microwave. Thanks."
1,dvd dont play in Australia why send them to Australia,"The dvd dont work in Australia, why would you sell these dvd to a address in Australia when we cant play themDo i return them and receive a refund. This goes for all dvd i paid for"
4,Movie Review for More than a Game,"This documentary is about five talented basketball players. The main character LeBron James leads the team. Their goal is to make it to the State Championship, then win the championship game. The school LeBron James went to was St. Vincent Mary High School in Ohio. I liked the ending when Lebron James and his team won the championship. More than a Game was released on October 2nd in select theaters. I would rate this movie four stars because it is interesting for me to see LeBron play basketball as a teenager. I would recommend this flim to anyone who enjoys watching sports or NBA Basketball.By Doodnauth Chandebal"
4,Highly recommended,If you are a Lebron James fan or know one this is the DVD for you. The title states it all.Gives you an insight into what makes the man you happens to be one great basketball player!
3,Ehh,"Well, I was very excited to get these bags, but was pretty disappointed in the results. The bags don't zip up securely; they aren't easy to use..I think (maybe) the less you put in them, the better they work.. But what's the point in that??"
1,Deflated Expectations,"Spacebags are a _fantastic_ idea... in theory. In reality, they simply don't work. The 'zipper seal' invariably fails, allowing air infiltration within hours of vacuuming. We thought we just got a 'bad box' of bags, purchased a second package, and two of those three bags showed evidence of air back inside within hours. I wish someone would start making air-tight storage bags that actually _work_. Until then, don't waste your money on this seductive but ultimately worthless product!"
4,Suprising little gem...,"I saw this picture before it was color corrected and before they'd laid a permanent sound track and it still had me rolling. I'd recommend it to anyone. Honestly, it's better than most of the romantic comedies I've seen in the last two years. The writing, in particular, was way smarter than a lot of what's being made nowadays. Very clever. Very romantic."
3,Sentimentalists read this,"Although the quality of the CD and Danny's renditions are enjoyable, do not expect the same cuts you heard 20 years ago -- my entire purpose in buying the CD was ""Wabash Cannon Ball"", which I enjoyed with my now deceased father. Unfortunately, the band's new mix, although expertly done, is entirely different, and in my opinion not nearly as good. Why the need to improve on perfection? Truly unfortunate and a bit frustrating -- perhaps I'll peruse the old LP's ..."
4,GREAT to again hear the sounds of the Nashville Brass,"Hopefully this company will re-release more sounds of the Nashville Brass. So difficult to find the old vinyl. This CD brings back some delightful memories when I played the group as an on-air DJ. At the price, it's a steal and a PLUS addiditon to your CD collection."
5,The Nashville Brass,Danny Davis & the Nashville Brass were favorites of mine years ago when I had it on LP 33 records. Didn't think I would find one on CD but did. Ordered and am playing it once again. Enjoying same.
4,THE TAVERN ON MAPLE STREET,IT WAS A GOOD READ BECAUSE ICOULD IDENTIFY SOME OF THE CHARACTERS WITH SOME PEOPLE I KNOW.
2,Caroline Winterson's voice...................,"OMG....... Caroline Winterson's voice was soooo irritating.I liked her normal voice and accent, but when she did the girls' voices, I could not bear it!!! even my cats groaned when she did the parts. dang... I'm on 4th CD now, but nothing much happening... getting bored..."
1,Trite and poorly written,This book is the literary equivalent of a stale Twinkie. There's a wince-worthy cliche or shopworn turn of phrase (or several)in every paragraph. The dialogue sounds like it was written for a grade-school play. I got stuck reading it on a trip - I went hungry for reading material rather than finishing this irritating book.
5,"Great ""old"" muic!","I love old ""country western"", now just country music. Can't be any better than Mel. It came as a recommendation from a friend."
1,For love-struck readers only.,"Here's a paragraph from ""All We Know of Heaven."" If you swoon, this book is for you; however, if it does not pass your giggle test, try something else: ""Sometimes I find myself standing and staring, mesmerized by the memory of our lovemaking, the crests of feeling our love has pulled into being, waves as metered and inevitable as the real waves pulled back from all the beaches of the world by the strength of the moon."" I can't believe I made it to the end of this 180 pages of silliness."
4,Dog Robe,"I LOVE this robe...my pup is going to be Hugh Hefner for Halloween and wear this robe! SO ADORABLE on him, too. This XL is a bit tighter than other XL things I have ordered for my dog. But overall, this is a great little something for that special little guy in your life. I received the product pretty quickly as well. I will likely order from this seller again."
5,Great for truck lovin' kids!,"My 3 year old son absolutely LOVES this DVD. We borrowed it from the library (he picked it out), and I'm wondering now if I'll need to buy it (or just keep borrowing it), because he wants to watch it over and over and over.It is so simple - just a bunch of trucks, tractors, construction equipment, etc. driving around doing what they do, to some goofy music. It's gotta be one of the cheapest made DVDs I've ever watched, but highly entertaining for my heavy equipment loving little boy."
4,Good video with real footage of trucks.,I bought 2 of the DVDs in this series for my almost-3-year-old. He likes them. The theme music is catchy and has gotten stuck in my head! Would recommend for any truck-lover.
3,"If you own Vol. 1, you don't need this one, too","This movie is good, but not different enough from the original to make it worth owning both. The music is ""better"" in the first and it only has 1 section of remote control cars. This one has a bigger segment on remote control vehicles which is not very interesting."
1,Lots and Lots of Trucks DVD Movie Vol.2,"Disk doesn't work, disappointing my child Christmas morning isn't what I had in mind. Won't send it back will cost too much."
3,"Nice picture, but very heavy","We purchased this tv because it had such high ratings. The biggest problem is the size and weight. It took 3 men to carry it into our house. It is very heavy. Also, I was never able to find a tv armoire to put it in, it was too big. The picture is nice, but with all of the features, it is difficult for my younger children to operate."
5,WOW!!!,"this is a breath of fresh airthis cd is the perfect kick back cdmost cds of this kind put you in a bad mood or get you violent this does none of the above, it puts me in a good mood. it is a very artistic cd with great vocals and drums."
5,PERFECT MOODY ARTO IS GREAT,this cd is great especially thinking about there are only 2 people in this band they are like the white stripes of world music! serj (SOAD) is good but the other person arto makes this whole cd up. this cd is worth the money i would have to say its one of the best cds i have!
2,Adventuresome but sophomoric,"I love CDs like this: two disparate styles crashing into one another. But this one just doesn't gel for me. It sounds like they layer on sounds to fill the empty spaces rather than to communicate. Sounds almost disingenuous, like they're playing in the studio, singing fakey foreign vocals, etc. It sounds like they don't have the life experience to inform the music with the credibility that's really needed for a project like this. Note maybe these two guys are totally legit. I don't know a thing about them, I just played it and this is my impression. Maybe I've got it all wrong. But as long as there are CDs you haven't heard by Banco de Gaia or City: Works of Fiction by Jon Hassell or the suprisingly good CD 'Miles Gurtu', pass on this one."
2,Disappointing,"This album is interesting, avantgarde, but for me it was really disappointing - there's nothing to compare with Arto's real band Night Ark (which I strongly recommend!) and their brilliant musical invetions. Serj's musical touch is often pointless, superficial. As a result, two talents are completely lost in their quest for something new."
1,Product falsely advertised,The product was advertised as Prep. H. When received - it was something else. It was returned for refund and I still have not gotten the refund.
3,An early edgy work from a truly talented band.,"Steps is Sieges Even's sophomore album and essentially the next step in the evolution of their sound. At this stage the music is not very accessible at all and the vocalist has a style that is an acquired taste at best. Later this band would come around to stronger songwriting and arrangements but for now the focus is on chops - a lot of them. The songs have a somewhat dissonant air and there are fills aplenty. The drummer and bassist keep the rhythm section tight and technical, and the album has many peak moments. I think it's a great album, but fans of their later material may be caught off-guard by it."
4,Much better than Reese,The Napoleon Tiny Smoked Oysters taste better than the Reese Petite Smoked Oysters.
5,a worthwhile purchase,"this book is definitely worth paying an extra couple of bucks...it hits home on so many points about college that even as a girl (cuz most of it is catered to guys) i could relate. overall it was really funny and something i wish i couldve read before i came to college cuz it has some hints that wouldve been helpful when i was 17, but even at 20 it made me laugh, i especially love the 10 commandments of college, they were funny the first time i read them online, and even funnier this time, definitely something im gonna let my lil sister read before she goes to college next year"
1,Wasn't recieved new.,"I bought this book new only to get a used book that had been writen on, bent and more. I'm VERY Disappointed."
5,Great Stuff,"This book is a great bathroom read. It is a hilarious take on college. Much more realistic than most college guides. And much funnier too. It hits all the points that should be hit, partying, drinking games, ways to get out of tests, and girlfriends...all with a ton of humor. I think it should be a staple for any incoming freshman. Very entertaining, and you can pick it up and read it for 5 minutes and go through the whole thing. A nice, light, and funny read."
1,This book is a joke...and that's not a good thing....,This book has nothing to do with what real college life is about.... When reading this book I really get the sence that whoever wrote this is / was completly disconnected from college life....as a side note: What happened to all the bad reviews?? I can only count 2 maybe 3 bad reviews here...a couple months ago there was like 11-12 bad reviews.... Is amazon just trying to sell more books or do the collegehumor guys dont like honest reviews??censorship is not going to win you any fans guys...
3,"Well, I actually haven't read it but...","I would like to at least defend the authors. I went to college with a few of these guys. I graduated in '02 and they were all younger than me. So, maybe we are not fresh out of high school, but they won't be getting their AARP card anytime soon. And they are some seriously funny people (at least in real life.) And by the way, Nintendo is spelled with an ""I"", champ..."
4,Good to me!,"This is a typical christian movie...though not as lame as others but yes the special effects need work. Nonetheless, we do plan to get the next movie! Looking forward to it actually!"
1,Thumbs down!!!,The Bible makes it clear as to what is says in Revelation. Jesus is not going to allow this to happen. It isn't good to twist the Bible this way even for entertainment.
2,Action Great; Doesn't Follow the Bible,"I was surprised when I watched this movie because it did have a lot of action in it for a Christian movie. The lead action gets a microchip accidentally injected into him; the problem with this is the bible talks about the Anti Christ forcing everyone great and small to receive this ""mark"" (not an average person that is accidentally injected with the ""mark"" and trying to keep Satan from getting his own mark of the beast back from the lead actor."
1,Deceptive,CAUTION this disk is only PART 1 of a multi-part series (how many parts? I don't know). The packaging does not mention this is only part 1 --- so you waste your time watching an average B movie that does not have the best acting but it is still interesting. The movie leaves you hanging when it ends and says the next part is coming soon. Kinda reminds me of the old serials that I used to see every saturday at the local theater and leaves you hanging until the next chapter. Well I wasted $$$ buying this DVD and am going to cut my losses by not buying the next chapter. I recommend that you save your money and don't buy this DVD.
3,For beginners only,"If you're just getting into hiking, are not in excellent shape and have a little trepidation about venturing into the ""wilderness,"" then I highly recommend this book. It has good descriptions of each trail and driving tips to the particulae trailhead. It also gives essential basic information about hiking gear, equipment and style that novices will need.However, if you're an experienced hiker, this is not your book. Opt for the John Robinson guides, because the treks here are not strenuous. It's inconceivable that any guide purporting to be about Southern California omits the three greatest hikes of the region: Mount Baldy, San Gorgonio and San Jacinto. But again, this book is for beginners and it goes a good job for them. I just don't want someone looking for long, strenuous hikes being disappointed with this purpose. Happy hiking to all!"
3,Dragon Ball GT,"This Particular series is completely different then the rest of them I wasnt impressed at all with these. They are still worth watching but I thought they got kinda got desperate when they made these trying to come up with ideas to keep the show going and they made Pam kinda a weakling compared to the rest of the family which she is Goku's grand daughter.I also didnt like the fact that it was mainly about Pam,Goku and Trunks in season 1."
3,dont buy this set the first season and second season cost less to buy together than this set,both the previous releases that funimation put out currently cost less to buy together than this set so dont waste the money on this one. but as for the series its a decent series definatly good if your a big dragonball fan but for non fans its alright. the first couple discs are really boring with tons of slapstick humor and weak oppenents but once baby arrives on the scene (and they finally find all the dragonballs spread across the galaxy) the series gets pretty good with its fair share of great fights (it may just be worth it for super saiyen 4 its awesome) anyone who needs more dragonball after z buy this series but if your not a fan its a decent series but you would not be missing anything special by passing on the series
4,4star,"People need to stop bashing GT. Yes, it wasn't as great as it would have been if Akira 'Legend' Toriyama would have done GT himself as he did dragonball and Z, however, that doesn't take away the fact that GT was pretty cool. I love the whole Baby arc, and the whole SSJ4 transformation that they put into it. However, if Toriyama would have worked on this himself, GT would have been a Legend as with its previous versions."
5,I love this show,Thank you so much for sending me the dvd so quickly and in such great quality. I received the dvd's before expected.
2,Bummer=(,"I was so excited when my product arrived. But when I opened the box, I found that the season's cases were all damaged. On the inside, there weren't any booklets even though there was supposed to be two(1 for each season). What made me really sad was that the product was BRAND NEW! I am not saying that each Dragon Ball GT: The Complete Series DVD set will turn out like mine did, but if you plan on buying it watch out."
3,save your $$,"i just bought this same exact set at Walmart for my boyfriend, a huge dragon ball fan, at $39.99 and yes it included the GT movie.Note: this was not avail at Walmart ever before to my knowledge. i just so happened to come across it and there was only two sets and i knew i had to get this!.if you want to save $20.00 then i would rec. you shop around. otherwise great product"
3,Meh...,"I love Dragonball and Dragonball Z, I mean LOVE! This was just a filler series IMO. Some of the enemies were cool but there were no Frieza's or awesome bad guys to get angry at, then when Goku and friends whooped on them you felt great about it. I got this to finish out my collection but I wouldn't really recommend it. Think twice before buying this because although it's a decent price the content just isn't up to normal Dragonball standards. (IMO)"
5,awsome series more please!,I have been wacthing dragonball ever since the early 2000's and when first got into them i was hooked..they need to made another series
5,Excellent value + high quality = A great product,"I have noisy co-workers. I wanted a relatively inexpensive pair of high-quality headphones for my office computer so I hopped on Amazon.com and picked up this pair from Sony. They are extremely comfortable and well-made and the sound quality is very good. Today at work I've been listening to everything from the Velvet Underground to Nine Inch Nails to Massive Attack and have been surprised and pleased at how fantastic everything sounds - the heavy bass and high notes are crystal-clear. For the money, this is a great buy."
3,"""Someone's Got To Do It"" ~ A Shaman, Not A Showman","As some of the previous reviewers have already stated, there isn't a lot of new material here particularily if you've already read the book `No One Here Gets Out Alive' written by Daniel Sugarman and Jerry Hopkins both of whom appear prominently in this 60 minute documentary/tribute to the Lizard King, Jim Morrison. Be that as it may I still found this DVD an enjoyable watch, especially the performances from the Ed Sullivan Show. I'm certain the hardcore Morrison fans will be disappointed but for those new to the Morrison legend, or the casual fan looking for a companion piece to the book by the same name this is a worthy enough item to add to your DVD collection.My Rating: Nothing definitive here but certainly a good place to start: -3 Stars-."
2,GO BUY THE COLLECTION,"Even though this DVD has some rare footage of The Doors members in a TV special interview in the 80s (I guess because of the terrible haircuts) buy it only if you are a hardcore fan collector like me. If not, pass on to the The Doors Collection DVD, which contains all of the clips included here uncut."
4,Very Interesting...,"This book contains two short novelas that are wonderfully well developed for their length. Both are surprisingly good and very different as well as original. Both are full of intrigue, and really caught my attention quickly. I have never encountered anything quite like them. I throughly enjoyed them, and would recommend them to anyone and everyone. Lee is a very accomplished writer with a vivid imagination and a talent for putting it into words. This was a book I picked up because I had nothing else to read and I couldn't have been more pleased with my accidental encounter with these two short Lee works."
2,Don't last,I bought a set of these as one of my origional bulbs burned out and figured I would update my 95 Volvo 850 with some brighter beams.Work the night shift so drive mostly at night these lasted 3 months unacceptable as far as bulbs go so put origional rated bulbs back in. They were brighter but unless you have lots of disposible income would not recommend these.
1,Very Short Bulb Life,"I purchased a pair of the 9003 XtraVision bulbs in May 2010, for my 2002 Saab 9-3, and in January 2011, both bulbs burned out, a few days apart. While the visibility provided by the Xtravision bulbs was very good, and somewhat better than the OE equiv. bulbs, their useable life was much too short. An auto headlight that only lasts 6-7 months is unacceptable to me. I put my two year old, used, OE type 9003s back into the car."
1,Short life,I changed both of my bulbs and was pretty happy at first. However one of them just died after about 11 months.
4,Read the fine print,"It claims to be 20% brighter yet that is based on the OEM bulb being 10% lost of light, not brand new.Yes they were brighter than OEM and I am glad I bought them but I kinda expected more.10% is not much brighter.The real bright ones if you look at their ""life"" charts don't last very long and cost a lot more."
4,Pretty good bulbs,A bit better then the OEM type bulbs for brightness. I've had them in my truck for 7 or 8 months now and still going.
3,hm...,"i gave only 3 stars because it's just a little bit brighter than my stock one. I didn't want to blind other drivers, so thats why i decided to buy this xtravision. I don;t know how long it will be lasted, but i don;t expect it will last as long as the stock one.I was a little bit disappointed on this product, and i will not recommend it to other people.it prefectly fit my 2004 xterra S/C, easy installtion."
2,Not for Senseo!!!!!!!!! Only for Black & Decker GT300,Replaces the Black & Decker GT300 HomeCafe coffeemaker's pod holder ONLY!!
5,The best thing yet!,"This is the best invention since the single cup coffee pot. I can actually make coffee at the strength I like and save money at the same time!! It's fast and easy to use. Love it, love it, love it!!"
3,Dash install kit,"Kit arrived in sealed bag but all pictured parts were not included. Since the ""double knob"" plate was not needed, no problem. But didn't include spacers to give option of flush mount which may of aesthetically looked better.Directions were straight forward as to which parts needed to be removed. Still worked,looks OK and was a good value,$5-10 less than box stores.Installed ""97 Jeep Grand Cherokee."
4,A documentary on an emotionally disturbing practice,"A look into the world of REAL physical human suspension. I loved it WARNING!!! not for kids,or the weak at heart!!! If you like seeing gory depictions of freaky human extremities, you will love this video."
3,Used,"This book was well-used with markings all over it, but I guess you take what you can get for the cheap price. It still works out great!"
4,Math for Meds by Curren,"The book is well put together however, there are many typo's within the problem sets. Looking beyond that one issue, the book is well written and well planned. The greatest asset of this book lies within the number of ""problems for practicing"" the mathematical concepts for dosing.Personally, I found the Dimensional Analysis method to be far easier, straightforward, and lends to fewer errors than the traditional algebraic methodology set forth from the author.All in all, this book is above average."
4,Text Books are Fun!,"Okay, so not everyone agrees how much fun a testbook can be. This book was pretty straightforward in explanation. Great examples, and plenty of practice."
3,politcally liberal great thoughts,"I bought the first edition of this book when I was 16 and have destroyed it through use over the years. His great thoughts are all of a progressive nature, and show modern conservatives in an ugly light.Seeing who is touted as the new additions to the new edition confirms my view that while a good book, it is ridiculously slanted. Deeply disappointing.Of great interest is that George Seldes was a grandaddy of journalism. One wonders what light his stories were presented to the public in."
5,The great book of 'The Great Thoughts',"I purchased the first 'The Great Thoughts' book about 20 years ago and I still have it. It is worn out, I have read it so much. I have taken this book with me through out my entire life. Every time I had a situation in my life that I didn't know what to do about or how to take, I would take this book out and find quotes or philosophy that inspired me or caused me to think deeply about how a quote or a philosophic view help me. This book was so inspiring and really helps you put things in perspective. It also inspired my love of book antiquities and now I own books published as far back as 1590. I highly recommend this book for deep thoughts and resolutions."
1,JUNK,"I TRYIED TO USE THIS BOOSTER 5-6 DIFFERENT TIMES AND GOT NOWHERE ON A CAR THAT JUST SITS IN MY DRIVEWAY UNTIL MY DAUGHTER LEARNS TO DRIVE A STICK. NEVER DID I GET THIS BOOSTER TO JUMP START THE CAR. I BOUGHT ONE MADE BY DURACELL, EASYIER TO USE AND STARTED THE CAR FIRST SHOT. I AM HOPING THAT THE ONE FROM BLACK AND DECKER WILL START MY ATV IF NEEDED. THE BLACK AND DECKER WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO CHARGE OFF OF MY DEAD BATTERY WHEN I TURNED IN ON. THEN I WOULD PUSH THE CHARGE BUTTON AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD SOUND AN ALARM SOMETIMES IT WOULD NOT. THE DURACELL YOU JUST SLIDE A SWITCH AND 10 MIN LATER YOU START YOUR CAR"
1,A Piece of Junk,"I was excited to receive this product in the mail because it would hopefully prevent hassles in my life with dead batteries. Unfortunately, this product doesn't work. I carefully followed the simple instructions to charge the unit from my home wall plug, and then from my car battery. In neither case would the unit charge. And without a charge, it is worthless. Now I will have to drive across town to a Black and Decker repair shop and hope that they will replace it with a working unit. Dare to dream. So much for my plan to avoid hassles!!!"
5,Easy battery booster,Purchased this product for my spouse. It is a great idea for having one in case your battery or someone else's battery fails to start. At least you can get to a repair shop without calling a tow truck if the vehicle's battery is at fault.
1,Junk Junk Junk! Beware!!,"I only gave this item a 1 because -5 stars wasn't available. I purchased this item to have on hand in case of emergencies, but what Black and Decker really sold me was a false sense of security. When I finally needed it one morning when my car wouldn't start. I have a 2005 Monte Carlo. After reading and re-reading the poorly worded directions, I still could not get this to charge my car battery. I would plug it in, push the boost button and it would look as though it was charging, and within about 5-10 seconds it stops boosting and it just starts beeping constantly indicating that the car is fully charged. I have charged the unit and repeated all the steps very carefully, and still nothing. It is a piece of junk, don't waste your money. Buy a real charger, or jump starter, or jumper cables. I wouldn't have another one of these if they were free."
1,It did not work for me either,"I have a Toyota Camry and could not start this morning due to cold weather. I bought one from Warmart and charged it fully. But somehow it kept beeping when I pushed Boost Push button and the Boost LED was not flashing at all, even I tried to turn the ignition key to the accessory position. This is neat idea though. Maybe I got defective one."
1,terrible,It just shrieks when we try to charge it. Nearest service center is 30 minutes away. Black & Decker should pay for us to ship this heavy gadget for an exchange!
1,BB7B B&D Simple Start,"This unit has a known defect, it continually beeps while charging. Not only does the unit not charge but the sound is too annoying to stand. B&D's remedy of turning the unit on and off several times does not work either. Be on the safe side and do not buy this product."
1,Didn't Work,"I bought 3 for Christmas presents - one for myself. Turns out, my Tahoe wouldn't start. I thought, What Luck! I plugged it in and gave it a try. I had a bit more juice but still nothing even close to start the vehicle. I then took a pair of jump cables and the Tahoe started right up.I guess I'm giving a pair of jump cables to every one that I bought this gift for."
1,"Not worth the trouble, and highly unlikely it will get you out of trouble","Please do not buy this product. I've never before reviewed a product but this one has wasted so much of my time that I had to comment. First, it was a gift (my poor father bought three of them). He charged them initially, and without ever having used it in six months, I tried to recharge it (it squealed continuously--see other reviewers). I called and got a replacement. Charged it. Today, I had a neighbor with a dead battery. Ah, I thought, to the rescue. Plugged it into the cigarette lighter and a piercing beep, beep, beep. Followed instructions and repeated process. No avail.I placed the owner's car on my plug in the wall charger and it started within the hour--so I know the battery wasn't bad or completely drained. If you have one of these in your trunk and think you'll ever really need it, I'd search for something that reliably works."
1,Such a Waste!,"I've used it twice. It failed to start my car both times. I followed the minimal directions they provided to the letter, with zero results. I expect more of B&D; Something has gone seriously wrong. This is the second B&D product this month that has been... Sufficiently negative words fail me - I will have to consult a thesaurus."
4,Sees to work but is a little inconvenient,"My objection is that you must recharge it every month, whether you use it or not (else it will not function when you might need it). But it does offer some security."
1,Can't get it to charge,"I received my BB7B and plugged it in the wall to charge the internal battery as per the instructions. The unit started to beep continuously which according to the instructions indicated that the internal battery was not charging. I called the factory service number that was listed in the manual and after ""troubleshooting"" with the customer service rep, I was told to return the unit as defective which I did. Two weeks later I received the replacement unit and had the exact same experience. Again the customer service rep (very helpful) walked through troubleshooting the unit and came to the conclusion that it too was defective. I am now waiting for my third unit to arrive."
1,Does not work,"On two occasions in the past two years, I really could have used this product. It didn't work. The lights indicate it is fully charged, but when I plugged it into the 12V accessory outlet, it did nothing. After the first year the light stopped working, too. Very disappointing."
1,Buy at your own risk!,Purchase this product at your own risk. I purchased one and it cost me over $600 in repair bills to have damages caused by this jump starter on my car.
1,Crappiest product I ever bought,I bought this battery charger and then I used it to start up one of my cars. I followed the instructions to the last word and it wouldn't work at all. The old fashion one seems to do a better job. So I advice anyone not to buy this thing.
3,"OK, but a safety concern","I have used this and it works fine. It is compact and easy to use. However, the cord has a tag on it that says something like ""this product is known to cause birth defects, wash hands after handling."" So that makes me feel uneasy about even touching it."
1,Did not work for me,"Please listen to the other reviewers that had problems with this product. I have tried it on two cars and it has not worked. I followed the instructions, fully charged the unit each time I used it, and waited for all the lights and beeps - but I couldn't start the cars. I will stick to the Grizzy Jump Starter I purchased a few years ago. It works everytime. I'm sorry I wasted my money trying to get something that seemed to be more convenient. I guess I'll just use it as a very expensive flashlight."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this the last time it was a ""deal of the day"". It got here very fast, perfect condition, simple instructions. You simply charge it, and then use it to add enough charge to your battery for your vehicle to work.Full disclosure: I have a Ford F250, which has 2 batteries in it. One day after it went from really cold to really hot, the batteries lost just enough charge for it to not turn over. No problem - I took my fully charged Battery Booster, followed the instructions, but it didn't make any noticeable difference in my truck.I then used a traditional battery charger (also from Black and Decker), and charged both batteries. They have been fine since (about a month).My recommendation would be to use this for a smaller vehicle that doesn't require as much juice to start."
1,bad battery boost,"I received the booster with instructions to charge it for 18 hours, so plugged the charger in. Fifteen minutes later it began sqealing, and the charge light started pulsing. It would not put out any current, so shipped it back to Amazon."
1,Did NOT work for me,"I have tried four units now and I have not been able to make any of them work. The first unit refused to charge when plugged into an AC outlet. This problem seems to be known to B&D. Subsequent units did charge, but exhibited constant beeping when I tried to boost the car battery. I don't know if it is the unit, the car or me, but I just can't get it to work. Seems like a good idea for a product, but something is not clicking here."
2,"Worked once, now two of them are broken","I purchased two of these about a year ago. They initially charged up fine, and when I happened to need to use one of them, it worked just as advertised. However, a year later, both are dead--neither one will charge. I've tried a new AC adapter, but that doesn't work. From what I can see on the other reviews, there must be some very cheaply made circuitry inside that fries after a while."
1,Can't make it work,"I've followed the charging/recharging instructions to the letter, but the one time my battery died I couldn't get the simple start to work. It just made a growling sound, and the flashing light and beeping did not happen. I ended up having to pull my jumper cables out anyway. The problem is that I can't test it out again until my battery dies, so I have no way of knowing if it will work on my other car. I would not feel comfortable giving this as a gift, or counting on it to keep my loved ones safe in the car. The one time I was in an emergency situation, it failed me."
1,"Product poorly supported, not-working right from the box","I bought mine to use as a portable 9-volt power source. Tried to charge it fresh from the box but got a wonderful, shrill beeping sound. The help line is only open 8-5 EST and so it was a few weeks before I could call customer service. First call the representative told me that this was a feature and was supposed to beep continuously through the charging cycle.I tried another call. This time the rep told me to cycle the power several times and this should resolve the issue. It didn't. I was referrred to a service center some 150 miles from my home, but discovered online that there is a service center within 5 miles... whew!Not happy with this purchase, nor with service after the sale."
1,Awful! NO STARS rating.,"These things ended up not working! You have to leave it home to keep it charged.. kind of defeats the purpose of it doesn't it! Stupid engineering. If you car dies at home, it's ok, but darned if it didn't work when we needed it.. and we had TWO of them! Neither worked so we sent them to the B&D; service center only to receive a check from them!We bought two, one for each car, but it doesn't fit in either glove box (Ugh). This means you have to find a secure place in your trunk to hold it. It's pretty heavy and could be a potential projectile if in an accident."
2,Good for one use only,I bought this battery booster just in case my battery died while its raining and my car battery actually died while it was raining. It worked beautifully and within 20 minutes I was on my way. I haven't had to use it since then. Its only a year old and it doesnt work anymore. I guess the battery lifetime is short. I charged it at least once a month when I didnt use. I would not recommend this product especially at this $99 price.
2,POSSIBLE PROBLEMS,"I CAN SEE TWO OBVIOUS PROBLEMS IF YOU ARE IN COLDER WEATHER, ONE IT TAKES A LOT OF POWER TO ROTATE A CAR ENGINE IN THE COLD WEATHER BELOW FREEZING AND IF THIS IS STORED IN YOUR CAR IT TOO WILL BE ICY COLD AND NOT YIELD MUCH OF IT'S POWER SO THE ENGINE WON'T TURN OVER ESPECIALLY V6 OR ABOVE. TWO, YOU MAY HAVE A DISCHARGED BATTERY THAT IS SO FAR DISCHARGED IT WILL NOT ACCEPT ENOUGH JUICE FROM THE NEW DEVICE TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND THE DEVICE ISN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH TO START THE CAR BY ITSELF, IT NEEDS THE HELP OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OVER IN THE CAR'S BATTERY, they operate in tandem. BUYER BEWARE, IT IS CONVENIENT BUT IN VERY COLD WEATHER IS IT ANY USE AT ALL OR TAKING UP SPACE, OF COURSE IF YOU KEEP IT IN YOUR HOUSE OR SIT ON IT FOR HOURS IT WILL BE NICE andWARM..."
1,beeps yes...charges NO,"Two times I was able to charge it successfully (but never used it to start the battery). From then on, it would not charge properly. But it does give off the most annoying beeping imaginable when plugged in to recharge. I followed Black and Decker's guidance, which included letting it beep for one minute followed by unplugging for one minute and repeating 10 times. I repeated far more than 10 times and it never worked. I had the unit serviced at an authorized dealer, and well, 4 months later they sent me a new unit. The new unit is experiencing the same problem as before.Personally, I have never bought a Black and Decker product that worked very well and this is certainly the last Black and Decker product that I will ever buy. They know that the design is defective, but they continue to sell it...shame on them!"
5,B&D Battery Booster,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my son and husband. They own a older vehicle with minor starting problems, so this will come in handy. Thanks for a great product!"
1,Do not buy this item!,"Absolutely, positively, under no circumstances should you purchase this item! I received it for a Christmas present, and charged it up the first time and everything worked great. The next time I attempted to charge it, however, it did nothing but beep. I could never get it to accept a charge no matter what I tried. Then I searched the Internet to see if I could find any information, and found that Black and Decker acknowledges that this product has a significant problem, but they don't offer to replace it! Many, many, many people have the same problem. Do NOT BUY THIS. I can't imagine why this thing is still on the market!"
1,Yet another example of outsourcing,"Still haven't received a unit that works correctly yet. Poor workmanship, cheap circuitry is the result of yet another once reliable American brand name utilizing overseas manufacturing to pad the bottom line. I would not have even purchased the product initially if I would've read some reviews."
1,Quality issues,"Unfortunately B&D; has manufacturing problems with this product. As a couple of other reviewers experienced, when I try to charge the unit it emits a continuous ear-piercing beeping noise similiar to that of a smoke detector. Returning it to the store tomorrow.Also, contrary to B&D;'s marketing materials, this unit is too large to be stored in most car glove compartments."
1,TRASH!,"STAY AWAY! These units are all defective, they fail to charge due to defective circuitry. I've been through 3 so far. Don't believe me? Just Google the model number, everyone has the same problem! Absolutely amazing any company would be willing to trash a well known brand name like Black and Decker just to make a quick Buck! And yet, they just keep selling them."
1,Awful. Glad I had jumper cables!,"My 2004 Honda Pilot's battery went dead due to a left-on interior light yesterday. Today, I was thrilled to try out my BB7B ""Simple Start."" It simply didn't work, despite being fully charged. No matter which cigarette outlet I plugged it into, nor which position my ignition was set to, the unit would not enter its vehicle boost cycle. Add to that the misleading naming and marketing of this product, and we have my worst ever Amazon buy.Thank the Lord that my wife wasn't using it or I wasn't stuck in some God-awful place -- and that I had jumper cables!!!"
1,Simple Start is simply useless,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT WORK.I am another of the many users who bought the Simple Start and did not need to use it for a couple of years.Like many other disappointed customers, when the day came that I needed to use the device, it would not charge - it just beeped incessantly at me!I see from many other reviews that this is a common fault with the product.One might expect that a hitherto reputable company like B&D; would issue a product recall - but don't hold your breath!I have many B&D; products and I used to consider their products to be reliable - but not any more."
1,Completely useless!,"The Black & Decker BB7B Simple Start 12-Volt Battery Booster is completely useless. As had been said in other reviews, this ""battery-booster"" was designed to ""ASSIST"" in giving an ""almost dead"" battery enough juice to start a vehicle. Most people are not going to sit in a dead car (in sub-zero wind chills no less) for 20 minutes in the hopes that the car may or may not start. The advertised use of this product is misleading."
1,Do not buy to start a dead battery! only a booster.,"It was fully charged and I tried to use on a dead car battery and it did nothing. I had to jump start with a 2nd car battery. Buyer beware, this is only a booster, not a jump starter. Jump starters are much heavier than this."
1,100% D I S A P P O I N T E D,"I bought this product before Christmas 08 and I have charged it every month exactly as the manual says.Yesterday my car battery died and I was kind of excited to use this product for the first time. I followed the instructions step by step, 4 times and IT IS NOT WORKING. A neighbor helped me to jump start (with cables) the car in seconds. From my experience I would not recommend this product."
2,Can use item.,Due to make of vehicle advised not to use. Car has computers in it. Recommended to not use .
2,Doesn't work on my car,"Had battery issues last winter, bought this as a safety net. However, it doesn't work on my particular car because the key must be on to use it so all it ended up doing is using up the juice for the dash lights and had no power to start the car. Waste of money for me but I'm sure it works better on those cars that don't need the key on to recharge the battery."
4,Dead is dead. Period.,"I bought this product to keep in the car in event of emergency. Sure enough, about a month after purchase my car wouldn't start.I found that even though the Simple Start has a small flashlight on it, it is not bright enough to see the labels on the control buttons in the dark. (remember, if your battery is dead, there is no overhead light).The battery in my car was over three years old, and dead. Really dead. Even the Simple Start would not recharge it.I recommend this product as part of your car's emergency kit, but only part. Still carry your cell phone, flash light, etc."
2,"I'm disappointed, the commercial is very misleading. That lady can't possibly get it started from what we've found.","So far the only thing we have found this good for is if you leave your lights on. We purchased 2 of these. One of the cars we have one in, the van is having problems with a short in the electrical system and Chrysler Dodge is not able to find where the problem is. So we purchased this so my elderly mother could just plug this in and jump the car. It doesn't work. So we have to go across town, hook the jumper cables up and start the car then disconnect the cables. You would think that this would work for that. It just needs that little bit of a jump, but it won't.So I'm very disappointed in that.I'm waiting to be able to use the two when they actually will work for me."
1,What a RIPOFF of a product! Does NOT work! Stay AWAY!,"About six months ago, we bought this product because we heard a lot of good things about it. Well, don't believe everything you hear. Due to a busy schedule raising our first baby, we simply did not get around to using it until recently, and it would not charge! We followed the instructions 'to a T', and the unit would not work at all- not even the low current built-in light. Now, as an electronics buff and Ham Radio operator, I know a thing or two about testing equipment, and when I hooked up a voltmeter, the unit didn't even show a very low level of voltage. The only conclusion I can draw is that this unit is defective and/or poorly engineered, or is not capable of any kind of 'shelf-life' over and above a few months, which is ridiculous. This is my experience with the 'Simple Start'."
2,Won't work on an older car!,"This charger did not work on my old toyota van.I finally had to use a plug into the house outlet, and charge it overnight.This booster just doesn't seem very powerful.Wouldn't buy it again."
1,Dont Recommend it,I bought the Black & Decker BB7B Simple Start 12-Volt Battery Booster for an emergency but the first time i needed to use it for the first time and it didn't work it didn't even want to turn on. when i got home i tried to charge it but when you hit the charge button all it those its continually beeps and the green light doesn't blink it just stays a steady green light. it only works when it connected to the wall outlet. i tried leaving it on for the night. But the next morning it still didn't want to work without it being connected to the wall outlet.
1,bad - out of the box,The unit failed to accept a charge either from the 115VAC adapter or from the auto cigarette lighter. I don't need the drama of sending it back for a replacement. I'm glad it was only $38.00.
2,Strong enough?????,"This product doesn't seem to be strong enough to power my vehicle. I work out of my vehicle and have run the battery down before, which was the reason that I purchased this item. However, this thing is irritating to use. It keeps beeping whenever you plug it in. I've checked the troubleshooting, and it shouldn't have been making any noise. Then when I actually needed it, it was beeping even worse. My vehicle had to be turned on for the booster to even appear as though it was charging the battery. Then the booster gave the indication that the battery was charged. But when I tried to start it, NOTHING. I tried three more times, with the same results. I eventually had to call AAA. I would not recommend this product. It just didn't do what it was supposed to."
1,useless,"utter trash, never worked, either one I ordered, had one a couple of years ago that did not work either. waste of money and time"
1,"Useless, as in ""Has no Function or Purpose""","We purchased two of these for a Subaru and a Honda. Both were in ""alert"" mode as soon as plugged into the lighter socket, and would not function. Tried to diagnose, thinking there must be a problem with the cars. I was wrong: sensor circuit disables unit when any power is sent into the unit, as when connecting it to a car without a completely dead battery. What B & D failed to realize was that this is a ""booster"", and will encounter current from the accessory plug from time to time, especially when a car has a battery installed. Like, uh...99.8% of the time. Returned both units, bought real ones. Not Black and Decker."
1,look for an alternative,"I had the same problem that others did. Fresh from the box, the device wouldn't charge. I called the manufacturer and they acknowledged the known problem. They tried to help me ""reset"" it but that didn't work. I purchased mine at a local hardware store. It is going back this weekend.This thing looks like a great idea for my wife - if it works."
1,This is really a brick,"My car battery was dead and I try the booster option in the brick. It did nothing but beeping for 15 minutes. Thanks to our good friends (AAA) who came on my request and helped me. This product is useless. After this incident, I tried charging the unit. The unit keeps beeping and does not charge anymore. No good customer service to resolve my problem. I recommend you my friends not to buy this red & black brick."
1,Beeping doorstop,"The directions on the box do not indicate whether the unit is charged already or if it needs to be charged before the first use. I charged it before I used it which, I guess, rendered it ineffective presumably due to overcharging. So I exchanged it and tried to use the new one right out of the box, it didn't work either. It's basically a hunk of junk. Do not buy this product unless you need a big beeping flashing doorstop."
1,Did not work!!,"I fully charged it and also put the ignition to ACC, but after the 15 minutes, I still couldnt start my car. My cockpit light got a little brighter. That is all. Dont buy it."
2,only works when your battery has some power left,The booster can't charge your car when there's no power left in your battery. You need to jump start your car first and drive a little bit.....then you can use the booster. So it's useless at this time!!
1,not very good,I'm with the others who had trouble charging it up. It only shrieks at me. I have to now drive 30 minutes to a service center. last black and decker product I will every buy.
5,For a man who has everything,I figured that if he has everything then he wont mind having this ... a very handy gadget - and gadgets he loves ... but also it is something i believe everyone should have
3,Battery Booster Needs a Boost,"Nicely designed, very compact, but it takes a looong, loong time to recharge the unit after you have used it or if you haven't charged it in a month or 2."
1,Worst battery charger ever,"1) Charged it per instructions2) Plugged into car and let charge per instructions3) Tried to start car4) NOTHING HAPPENEDAlso, the product has to be recharged every month. Who's going to remember to take this out of their car and recharge it once a month?!?!?"
2,Black & Decker Simple Start Battery Booster,"My son left his car with me and the battery went dead. I hoped I could use this to get it going, but it didn't happen. I'm not great at using jumper cables. Guess this is good if my car needs a boost in cold weather - we shall see."
2,Battery booster,"Sorry to say I didn't like this product. I tried several times to jump start (Or charge) a car battery and it failed all the time. I have seen this in stores as ""Closeouts ETC.) I think everybody is getting rid of them. I'm keeping it for a external battery supply for a GPS unit in an airplane otherwise I would have tossed it. That's about all it's good for. Save your money and buy a regular charger or trickle charger and leave it on your car overnight and it will start in the morning, but not this puppy."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this product to keep in my trunk in case my battery died. I plugged it into the wall to charge it, but all I get is an incessant beeping. The unit won't charge, and the Black and Decker support directed me to keep trying to charge it in the hopes that it might start working.The unit won't charge. It's pretty, it looks like it could be very useful, and it has a nice design. But it won't charge."
2,I'm sure some of them are great.,"I got this because when I am a forgetful person and have left my headlights on 3 times in the past month. I bought it, took it home, and followed the directions on charging it, and it started beeping loudly as if an alarm was going off. I know I'm not the only one with this problem ([...]), but I figured I'd exchange it to see if it was only that one that was defective. Wrong. The second one did the same thing, only the beep was different. Currently I am trying to find the time to exchange it again, and hopefully 3rd time's the charm. I'm sure it's a great product if you can find one that works, but I've had no such luck, and based on other review I've seen, neither have many other people."
1,Won't Recharge,"Useless product. I purchased this unit and plugged it into the wall to charge it. It beeps incessantly when I pushed the recharge button, and won't hold a charge. The black and decker website says to turn it off and on, and try recharging it again, but that doesn't work.You may be tempted to purchase this product, but you're wasting your money. Don't say you weren't warned."
1,"Piece of junk, B&D poor CS just compounds it","Gone through two of these pieces of garbage. Never actually got to even use it, the batteries simply don't last. Judging by other reviews of this, that appears to be the norm. Funny how Consumer Reports recommended it. Shows their level of competence. You call B&D; CS for warranty coverage, and they tell you to drive 50 miles to one of their service locations. Yea, right. And Bush was a good president. Thanks, but no thanks, will buy another brand.UPDATE: After a complaint to the BBB, B&D;'s Executive CR called and now admits that this product has a known inherent problem. That's why they are no longer on the market. They offered to buy it back from me. At least it's nice to know that what I suspected is true. B&D; just doesn't make the products like it used to. Probably why they are being aquired"
1,Useless,"I bought it, put it in the trunk and forgot about it. I pulled it out one day and went to plug it into the wall to charge it. It's been sitting there for about two months. I check it twice a week, still hasn't re-charged. It's a waste of money. I'm glad I didn't have to rely on it when I needed it."
1,don't waste your money,"purchased this item and needed to charge a car battery about 3 weeks later but the unit didn't work. returned it for replacement and that unit also did not work. the charger sounds great in concept, nice design and features, easy to use buttons and controls but all of this won't get you moving when your car battery is dead. it has been a long time since i have purchased an item that performed so badly. didn't even bother returning the second unit - i have wasted enought time with this useless device."
2,an okay product,I've only had this product for a short while and I've discovered a few interesting things about it. It does work for starting a car with a weak battery. It DOES NOT work if the battery is dead.I have a car that I don't use very often so the battery can get weak or even dead if I don't use it every few weeks. When trying to start the car I found that the device works okay only if the battery still has some life in it. So it's of limited use for what I really wanted to use it for. When I plugged it in while the battery was dead it just keeps beeping (which means something isn't right.)Now if you want to use it for other purpose it's a fine device as the light works fine and I'm sure the other parts work fine too. It's just not a good fit for how I wanted to use it.
3,Black & Decker Simple Start Battery Booster,"At this time I am not able to rate the performance of this product....It is one of those things that you buy...hoping never to use!...It appears to be of good quality and the flashlight function works good, however, I can't rate it's performance until I have had an emergency situation in which to test it."
1,China garbage two in a row won't charge from day 1,"As many others have reported, right out of the box, when you try to charge the simple start, a constant ear piercing shrill emits and the light remains steady green. Turning the unit on and off does nothing. Read the instructions over and over - tried everything from changing the order of hooking things together to different outlets to opening closing the cigarette lighter gate - nothing works. UNIT CANNOT BE CHARGED! Got a replacement only to find IT HAD THE EXACT SAME DEFECT! Black & Decker has obviously outsourced their good name and now sells nothing but china garbage. I will never buy another black & decker product again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,This product fried my car. I had to buy a new one. It fried the alarm system and the PCM.
2,Battery charger,"Not worth the money I'd rather buy a jumper starter for the same amount and have my car start ASAP. The idea is good but unfortunately I should have read about the whole product. You have to let it charge the battery for 10 min. before it will start. Thats a long time when your waiting. And the selling point was that you did'nt have to get out of your car in the elements, well it's still cold in a car that's dead with no heat. I'd rather tough it outside for 2 minutes than wait for this piece of crap."
1,Piece of junk!,"Thank God I never had to use this for it's intended purpose! Total waste of money! Charged this thing up as instructed and kept it in the car on standby. Checked it a month or 2 later and it needed charging again, but it simply stopped working and would not take a charge anymore. Thought they were reputable, but I'll never trust Black & Decker again. Should have checked the Internet for all the bad reviews this thing is getting."
1,Best as a heavy Doorstopper,"Dead battery in an airport parking lot late in the evening - just the job for 'Simple Start' - well, it is neither 'simple' not did it 'start' anything.I 'charged' the unit a few weerks ago to avoid a mishap and gave my jump cable to my spouse.Proudly plugged the unit in the adapter per instructions and ...nothing. An hourt later and to make a long story short, a ended up flagging down a good samaritan who helped jumped the battery.Save your hard earned dollars."
1,Massive Failure,"I have never written a review on here, but I need to for this. I never actually used the thing, but I charge it up each month or so like instructed. I bought this in September 2007. It charged fine until this month. When I press the ""recharge"" button, the light blink and an annoying and constant beeping sound starts. It will not recharge. I saw from a search that MANY have had the same issue with this product. I am glad I only paid $50 and not $100, but it is a rip off anyway. PLEASE find yourself another product."
1,Does not work!,I was skeptical on believing a car battery could be charged from the inside of the car but I decided to buy this device because it was a trusted black & decker product. One unfortuanete afternoon I got to my car to realize my car batttery had died because I forgot to turn off my headlights. I thought it wouldn't have been too much of hassle because I had my Simple Start but it did absolutely nothing. I had to end up waiting until someone with jumper cables stopped to help me out. This device does not work!
1,Doesn't work as intended/ Don't rely on it in emergency.,"I have a 95 nissan maxima. It has a slow drain on the battery so I figured this would be the perfect item. Got back from a trip and the battery couldn't turn over the engine. Followed the directions using the fully charged booster and plugged it into the cigarette lighter. It told me it was charging and then after 5 seconds it beeped continuously and said it was full. I tried to start the car/nothing.Perhaps my unit was defective, but it looks like several people are having similar problems. I guess I will just buy one from a company that knows how to make a better consumer product. TEst this before you rely on it in an emergency so you are not stranded."
3,Quick replacement for received defective item,Received item. Defective. Called provided phone number to complain and throw rocks. Service people very knowledgeable and helpfull. I am mad because I couldn't throw rocks. they sent to me a new item working and shipping stickers for defective item return to depot.
1,Avoid this defective product,"I have now purchased two of these items. The first was a purchase for my fiancé. The second was to replace the first one in an attempt to find one that would work.These devices will not charge. After unboxing them and following the instructions for charging from a 110/120 AC line they proceed to chirp obnoxiously just as many others have discovered. Power cycling them per the B&D; FAQ does no good. In the end, I returned both of them to the stores where they were purchased.I will not spend any more time on this product."
1,Battery Start UNDER-Booster,"Nice little package with lots of claimed potential, however, when our less than two year old 2005 pickup truck battery ran down from an unchecked map light, and we tried using the fully charged BB7B as advertised, letting it complete it's cycle with appropriate lights and sound feedback, it could not boost the truck battery enough to achieve a start. Recharged BB7B and tried again - same results. We had to go and get a regular battery charger to recharge the truck battery."
1,Avoid this product,"1. The battery booster will not start a car with a dead battery. It only works with a battery that has run down to the point where it will not turn over the engine. You will need a much stronger booster to start a car with a totally dead battery.2. The booster can ruin the computer electronics on some cars. This is stated in the instruction manual. However, when I called the Black and Decker service center, they had no list of which cars would be effected. The service tech said he wished he had a list but he didn't. I guess you're just supposed to try to use this product on your car and find out later.3. I have not returned the product since it will boost phones, etc. and may have some use. However, if I had known that it did not work on dead batteries and could ruin my car, I would never have purchased it."
1,This product needs to change some components,"All over 60 years old were raised under Black and Decker reign.All the products were equal to quality.That surely has changed, at least with this Black and Decker BB7B Simple Start 12-Volt Battery Booster.When I discovered it I was at once fascinated with the product and inmedaitely bought one. It came out defective.I filed my claim and Amazon replaced the item.COULD YOU BELEIVE the replacement was faulty also. I gave up and this second time didn`t file a claim. I am an egineer and now after readings some other reviews plus my own experience plus the type of failure, I am convinced that the problems with this item are some of its components.The idea is superb, the design is good and the size and weight are good. I want to encourage B$D to revise the type of components used in this item. What about a recall?"
1,GOOD CONCEPT BUT DOESN'T WORK,THE P.R. AND THE CONCEPT WAS GOOD HOWEVER THE UNIT IS WORTHLESS. IT WONT HOLD A CHARGE. I DID AS INSTRUCTED AND EVEN TOOK IT TO GET TESTED. IT TESTED O.K. BUT DID NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED. IT WAS USED ON A FRIENDS CAR THAT HAD A DEAD BATTERY. IT WAS INSTALLED AS INSTRUCTED AND AFTER 30 MIN AND WVWV AN HOUR NOTHING HAPPENED. BAD INVESTMENT.
3,Works for me - but not withou problems.,"I tested my new battery charger on my Toyota Prius and it works - but not without problems at first. I started by charging the device through a regular power outlet. I didn't have any problems with charging it. I then took it to my car. The car battery had a little juice left (enough to start the car) but I wanted to see whether the charger/booster could fully charge the car battery. It did not work when the car was fully turned off. I then started the car on ""accessory"" mode and then plugged in the charger (as directed by the instructions). Not only did it not charge the battery. It drained it and as a result I could no longer start the car! I tried to charge it again, this time with the car was in full start-up mode. After a few minutes of charging, it worked and it did fully charged the car battery. Hope this comment could help those who couldn't get it working on a Prius."
1,Junk,"I bought one of these during the winter of '06-07. It stopped working shortly after I bought it (would not charge). I called Black & Decker and they sent me a replacement. Ditto -- did not work, and failed to work exactly the same way as the first. Having only so much storage space in my house for unusable lead batteries, I did not request a third, but instead got new car batteries for both cars, and a good set of jumper cables for each -- which I never needed to use during the much more severe winter of '07-'08."
1,Does not work,2005 Honda Pilot battery drained. Could not jump start with another vehicle. Brought the B&D battery booster at Target. Charged battery booster fully as instructed. Could not get it to work properly (tried the ignition key in all the positions). Aslo got the Duracell Instant Jumpstart System. Duracell worked like a charm.
1,The Beeping is Scaring my Cat,From reading everyone elses reviews i take it my unit doesnt work. it wont recharge and just sits there a beeps. My Cat hates it as much as i do. This product sucks.
1,Did not work from the start,"I bought this item about a year ago and at first, I thought that my car lighter was not working but it is working, it's this battery booster that is not doing its job. Even after I left it to charge for a full day, when it was needed, it still did not do the work. To think that at the time I bought it I paid about $54 plus shipping and handling to be delivered on a saturday but it did not work. I wish I took the time to return it."
2,I was all excited to be able finally use this.....,"Every month or so I charged this item. Finally, when a friend of mine called to say her car battery was dead, I had a chance to use it. No. Her car battery wasn't the only thing that was dead."
1,"Charge once, throw away.","I purchased this battery booster from Black and Decker when they first came out, based on reviews I had seen on the talk shows. It would not recharge, so I called the manufacturer. I was told it was recalled and I received a new one from Black and Decker. Great, except that the second one never worked either. I charged it, used it once (unsuccessfully) then attempted to recharge it. It would not recharge either. So, it's a one-time use product. Now I have two pieces of toxic junk to dispose of safely."
2,"Works great, for one year","I've bought 3 of these, for me, and 2 women friends. They're great for people who may need a jumpstart, but don't know how to use jumper cables; or for people who might need a jumpstart in an isolated place. You don't even have to open the hood; just plug them in, wait 5 minutes, and start your car.BUT. They don't last. After a year, you can't recharge them anymore."
1,Don't bother,"This is next to useless - in fact only good use is a door stop. When first got it it charged succesfully..... when I wenet to use it, admitadlty many many months later, it would not work..... thought maybe had lost charge but it won't recharge."
1,5.1 is a joke,"This product doesn't give 6 channel (5.1) output on the optical port. I tried it on Vista 64 bit, vista 32 bit and also on a winxp 32 bit computer. It works, but I get only 2 (only left and right) channels on my home theatre receiver. When i goto view sound devices under control panel in windows, and click on the configuration or properties tab for this device, I see only a 2 speaker configuration. Any Windows doesn't seem to see this device as a 5.1 sound card. Since you get two channels out of it, you will hear sound but it is important to note that its not 5.1 as the device's description promises. ANTOnline has a no refund policy for computer products ..so I hope SIIG gives me my refund for buying this device on the basis of its misleading description"
1,Not worth it,This book isn't very informative and not worth your time reading it or the money spent buying it. There are other books out there about substituting that have to be better.
2,Nothing modern about this book.,"This book concentrates primarily on the mercenary of the 1960's. Even when this book was published, it by no means concentrated on the modern mercenary.Nowadays it's all corperations, from MPRI and Sandline. I don't even think the book mentioned the now defunct South African firm, Executive Outcomes.It's a fantastic historical read if you want to know about Mad Mike Hoare. For that it's worth it.Another good book about a mercenary is called Soldier Without Fortune, by Dr. John L. McLure, who served in Nicaragua in 1983. It's hard to find, but it's good solid read. The good doctor is dead now, but he did leave behind a fantastic story."
5,A great book with brilliant atmosphere!,"This story is centered around an old inn on the Kent marshes in rural England at the time of the Napolionic War. Old Dot and Aunt Beet have been left with the care of thier neice Lucinda, as she grows up she becomes very beatiful and the old aunts try to protect her from the outside world, but a mysterious stranger has his eye on Lucinda, and eventually a tragedy awaits the young girl. What of the Shulmead family who work the old forge up on the hill? Sam the tyrannical father is found with his head completley hacked off, has it anything to do with his sons Matt and Mark who suddenly run away to the Army? Or was it his son John, who slaves away at the brickfields from dawn till dusk with Larlee his drunken slovenly taskmaster? Or yet another Shulmead son Luke the imbecile? Find out in this lively and atmospheric novel."
4,A good Concert,"John Foxx to me is the real leader of Ultravox, but Midge Ure has his own ability and songsmith. A very good concert fo;m."
2,"Excelent sound, terrible director","If you ""see"" this DVD with closed eyes you could feel the sublime beauty of Flamenco music, but when you open your eyes you could only feel dizzy :S. The editing is by far the worst I've ever seen, is like see the video of your daughter's sweet 16, but filmed by your drunken cousin Joe.Don't waste your money, unless you like headaches."
3,"Great Show, Poor Editing","This DVD was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, Joaquin's dancing is superb and his musicians and singers are wonderful.This show was heavily edited...way too much. The shots are wizzing around so fast, it is enough to make you dizzy.If all you are after is a taste of Flamenco, then you will enjoy this. Unfortunately, Flamenco dancers, like myself, will be disappointed. Just when the dancing becomes intense, they will cut to a singer. Or when very technical footwork is being done, all you will see is a closeup of Joaquin's face. You never really get to see the complete step combinations.Though, I do miss the fabulous energy of the female members of his company, it is a very good ""one man show"", which has just been subjected to too much editing."
3,its ok,"mirror housing looks good. removing the old and installing the new was easy, product fit very well, but - the mirror glass and the manual control arm are could be better made. the mirror, not the housing, vibrates and moves a bit when driving, unlike original equipment.not bad for the price, but better for an older car where you may not want to spend a lot on a replacement mirror. ok for a car you don't care too much about."
3,Too much Sweet'n Low!,"This recipes has great recipes and wonderful ideas even for someone who hates cooking as much as I do!! However a lot of the recipes calls for Sweet'n Low, I don't really care for the taste of it and try not to use it in my cooking."
5,My Favorite Low Carb Cookbook,"This is my all time favorite low carb cookbook. I use it more than all of my other low carb cookbooks combined. I've had great success losing weight on the Aktins diet mostly because I use this cookbook. There is a lot of variety and most of the recipes are quite simple and quick to prepare. I love the helpful hints in the beginning of the book. Some of my favorite recipes are the Mock Mashed Potatoes, Hasbrowns, Florentine Breakfast Squares and the Seafood Newberg, yummmm! But there are many many more that I prepare on a regular basis. My husband is even losing weight (and he is not dieting)just because of the great low carb dinners I prepare for us every night. If you are living the low carb lifestyle, than I highly recommend this cookbook."
1,Not so great,"I bought the Atkin's cookbooks and was looking for additional recipes. Unfortunately, everything I made out of this cookbook so far has turned out to not be very tasty. I would not recommend this cookbook."
1,Lauri's Low-Carb Cookbook:Rapid Weight Loss with Satisfying,"A waste of money!! The book refers to Dr. Atkins book all the time. I should have bought Dr. Atkins book. How can this book be low carb when the ingredients call for butter, or heavy cream. Did she forget about all the fat in all her recipes."
4,from Cheyenne WY,This cookbook is easy to use and the recipes require items ordinarily found in the pantry -- What a nice change! No more special-ordering for me!
3,It's ok,"The intro of this book is helpful, giving a general overview for people who might not know a lot about a low-carb diet. The recipes are varied and there really is something for everyone. The ingredients are not fancy, many of which would be found in most household kitchens or your everyday grocery store. My biggest issue with this book is that it does not tell you the amount of fiber in each dish. This is important because fiber is one of the things that you get to subtract from total carbs (ie. it doesn't count!) and that is important. Some of the recipes are also a little vague and I question the actual total number of carbs if you tried to make the dish yourself. For example, there is a recipe for Alfredo Chicken. One of the ingredients is alfredo sauce, but such a recipe is not found in the book and most brands that I viewed in the grocery store were fairly high in carbs. Like I said, it was O.K."
5,THIS is the LC Cookbook to Get,"If you have been researching LC cookbooks and cant decide which one to go with, this is the one to get. I found it to have a great variety of tasty recipes that are quick and easy to prepare using normal and easy to find ingredients. It makes preparing my grocery list very easy. The format is well done and the helpful hints are just that. You can tell a lot of thought and time went into this book. Cant go wrong here."
1,It doesn't even fit!,"This product does not fit an Ipod Nano 2 even though it was advertised that it fit all Nanos. Amazon directed me to the supplier, the supplier referred me to the manufacturer, the manufacturer said they would send me an adapter and I have never gotten it in spite of 2 follow-up phone calls.Bad news all the way!!!!! It's useless to me!!!!"
2,Good idea; Didn't work,While this is a very elegant solution I found that in actual use each time I hit the slightest bump the Nano would disconnect from the unit. The car is an '88 BMW so maybe the stiffer suspension in this car was a factor. I wish it worked!
2,"Good idea, not well implemented","I was pretty excited about this product as I'm not a big fan of the FM transmitters used to play ipods through your car stereo. It is pretty convenient to have an actual dock for the ipod to sit in and the base itself is nice looking. However, there are a few problems:1. Make sure that your tape player accepts tapes with the tape surface on the right. The base of the ipod connector swivels right and left, but doesn't flip over. So if your tape player only accepts tapes with the magnetic strip on the left, then the only way to get this to work is with your ipod upside down! As far as I can tell this appears to include most Audi automobiles. Don't know if any other manufacturers have this problem.2. The sound quality does tend to be fairly distorted. Songs with a lot of treble will be borderline painful to listen to. The review describing it as playing a song too loudly through small speakers is probably the best way to describe it."
4,I really like this and prefer it to an FM transmitter,"I bought this product after being frustrated with my FM transmitter for my iPod. It was very difficult to find a clear channel in the Atlanta area, and it was even worse when traveling. I like the design of this product, especially the lack of wire coming from the tape deck and the swiveling head so you can see your iPod screen easily. I also like that it comes with a cord to charge your nano if you want to. I have a 2nd generation nano, and the box included the adapter to make it fit properly. My only complaint is that the tape itself makes a bit of noise in the cassette player in my car. It's MUCH less noisy than the static from my old FM transmitter though. So overall I'm very pleased."
4,"Writes well, feels okay in hand",We like the B2P pens better in terms of green-ness and the size of the pen. But these work just as well and feels okay in our hands.
3,Disappointing,"When I read the description I was excited to learn the techniques. Since the entire book could be reduced to one page (because there are basically only 2 techniques - both angle cutting), most of the book is really just repeating what you learn in the early pages. There are great teaching books and then there are others - this is an ""other"". Good idea, but not enough information to fill a book."
3,Notebook PC carrying case,"It seemed to be a good quality product at first, but after a few trips and use the pocket liner came apart. The case is still usable, but the loose liner is an annoyance."
3,not impressed,"The eye gel is very light, but it is absorbed well. I don't feel too much difference after applying it though."
3,A fascinating way to knit domino knitting,"The book has good instructions how to knit the different squares and triangles and how to make them all together. (My book is in Norwegian, I dont know the exact words.)In the beginning I was impressed by the book. It fascinated me to knit that way. But I experienced that the garments are shapeless and rigid. If they dont fit neither grown ups or children, you have spilt a lot of yarn; it is not possible to take it apart. I have bought a couple of other books giving the same method. The garments in them are looking very fancy, but in contrary to Hxbo, instructions are not good. Maybe with the mix of two books, I can come to a better result. The method is not quite new either. In Norway we have ""kontestrikk"", built on the same technique. Hxbo and others have used it to create modern fashion, and that is good. Grete"
4,Good Designs,"I liked this book better than the Horst Schulz book--Domino Knitting's projects stand up on their own without relying on fancy (read: expensive) yarns. The Amazon price is a more realistic one, considering the size of the book."
2,A clearly written explanation of a fascinating technique,"I've read many magazine articles on domino knitting, and have made pieces in the past. The small book clearly, in word and in diagrams, teaches how to use this technique. I finally understand *exactly* where to pick up stitches and I liked the way in which the projects referred back and forth to each other.My low rating comes from the format of the book itself. The book is so small, and the cover is so stiff, it is very difficult to keep the book open to refer to while knitting. Also, entire sections of my book were misprinted--mostly blank pages, but then another section was printed slightly off center."
2,Domino Knitting,"This technique is difficult. The author teaches you how to make a lot of pot holders, but her instructions for garments are extremely vague and confusing."
4,"Nice book, but like other modular book better","I give this book 4 stars because it is a nice little book, that explains the technique well. The author uses mitred squares as the basis for her modular knitting. The pictures are nice and the instructions are clear.Still, I like the book Woolly Thoughts better. That book gives more information and inspiration, plus lots of technical info. They really help you see the math of it all and encourage you to explore for yourself. I think that book will end up being more useful."
4,Missing 1 thing,"The show is awesome but it's missing one very important thing, Dante never devil triggers! I thought this show would be like the game where in tough times, Dante will need to show his true form and that's when he transforms himself to demon mode. I don't know why they didn't do that. They knew about it because they had Dante foes turn into Demon form, but not him.I thought at the very end of the series that...okay, maybe, just maybe this will be the time, where he needs to transform because it looks like he needs MORE POWER!!! Then, it happened!Nothing!!!Dante, just suddenly believes he can do it and kick the last guys butt like nothing. What??? He didn't need more power. He didn't need to do anything. All he needed was believe in himself and there you go, he wins like nothing. WTF?This show would had got 5 stars, but is only 4 because I don't know why they didn't have Devil Trigger!!!"
2,Great idea bad exection,"I had big hopes for this show even after the first couple episodes, but it never did deliver and it just all fell flat on its face. none of the story ever really makes sense and barely even tries to explain itself. its all just a discombobulated crap fest, and should not be viewed by fans of anime, or the video games. spend your money on better series not this one."
2,EHHHHH!!!,"Not what I personally want in a series, a guy who's just absolutely above every enemy he faces and the only thing he doesn't face is adversity."
5,"For Fans of the Series, Great Buy","I mainly bought this movie for my little sister who has become obsessed with this franchise just as of late. Since this is mainly what she likes, then it was unmistakable that she was going to love it. She enjoyed the crap out of this movie. As far as comparing it to other anime's though, it does stand up well on it's own especially if no one has ever heard of Devil May Cry. A great watch with some great action scenes and fairly good dark humor. Still, you should already have been expecting that if you're familiar with the franchise."
3,It tastes Familiar.....,"Devil May Cry is a truly beautifully created anime series that has very few flaws within it's story.The main premise has been done to death by Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star.Lazy or disinterested hero gets sucked into a story, beats down the bad guys and resumes life as normal because each episode can honestly stand alone.For the comedic type, there is some dark/fun humor involved in the series but in the end, still lacks a bit for the elegance of the games UP TO and NOT INCLUDING 4."
1,how could they go so wrong?,"when i bought this i had way higher expectations... there was barley a plot, most of it made no sense.. it was like watching all filler episodes, you can tell they made this crap just to market the name and make money off it. it is not well thought out. i just wonder how can you go so wrong with this series? i watched the first episode in horror and with hope watched the rest, wasting hours of my life in the process.. do yourself a favor go get basilisk or something with more depth, story line and better fight scenes.. i wouldn't even waist 5 dollars on it"
1,Ugh!,"So a friend lent this to me promising that it was entertaining. I actually liked the first episode, but by the second one I was already bored out of my mind. The other two reviewers that gave it a one pretty much sum up how bad this series is. No need for me to keep stating the obvious."
5,Another great Trine book.,"This author has been an inspiration and guiding force in my life through his insightful observations, thoughts, and ideas. In fact, I enjoyed this author so much, I wrote a paper on his life and works in a philosophy course (existentialism) that I took this fall. Needless to say (without stroking my ego), I did get a 99 on the paper. Trine's major work ""IN Tune With The Infinite"" was also quoted in the paper, along with ""Every Living Creature"", ""Characture Buildine Thought Power"", ""What All The Worlds A-Seeking"", ""In The Fire Of The Heart"" and ""The New Alignment Of Life."" This is an author that has so much to offer that I've aquired all of these books in 1st edition hardcover for my little home library. This was one of the people that early members of Alcholics Anonymous read for Spiritual inspiration. Along with being a major influence in the New Thought Movement, he had an impact on others as well. GREAT READ!"
4,"Not bad, not great","Just your standard headphones. The highs seem to cut through a little more clearly than in my Apple earbuds. The foam covers are crap and tore into little pieces when I tried to remove them from the case, I don't use them anyways. The case is kind of nice to have."
2,Stick to EA's NHL Series,"I've always played EA sports games, but with the $20 price tag I decided to try out espn nfl 2k5. I feel that is the best football game i've played much better than madden so i decided to give espn nhl 2k5 a shot. As soon as the game started all i could think about is how arcade this game is. The graphics of ea are much more realistic as is the gameplay. Espn has a long long way to go in the hockey series if they want to put out anywhere near as good a game as ea. I'd say if you want to get the best and most fun hockey game out there definately go for nhl 2005 and leave espn nhl 2k5 on the shelf."
3,Mediocre at best..,"Okay, all in all is this game worth $20? .. Maybe. Is this game the greatest hocky game ever? Definatly not. Lots of little things were left out...how hard would it have been to show who scored the goal afterwards?? I mean come on, that's basic game programming 101..I'd say rent it before you buy..it's not for everyone."
5,EA SPORTS STEP A SIDE!!!,"THE BEST HOCKEY GAME EVER!!!. 2K4 was good but 2K5 is sweet!!. IN this game the detroit redwings are the best team, then comes the tampay bay lightning. For $20 bucks this game rocks!!. EA Sports stink now. NHL 2004 sucked!! I saw the trailer for NHL 2005, and it still stinks~!!. Get ESPN 2K5, and save $30 bucks. If you like the EA Sports seris then think again!!.Try the real thing!~ ESPN 2K5!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,There are no words...,"There are simply no words in the human vocabulary to fully encompass how I feel right now, as I have just finished reading Joey W. Hill's ""Make Her Dreams Come True."" This story was, in a word, amazing. I thought I was going to read a piece of fluff to pass a little bit of time and instead I found myself riveted to a story that probed into my own psyche in ways that were almost scary and brought tears to my eyes with the hero's utter selflessness. For some romance and love may be candlelight, roses, and dancing through the night like Cinderella; for me, this is probably THE ultimate love story in every possible way."
2,Please can it be over yet?,"I really enjoy Joey W. Hill books and have even bought them for friends, but this one just made me want to pull my hair out. I couldn't take being in the mall the whole time. I wanted steamy hotness up front and all the mind games just gave me a headache. I eventually just skipped straight to the end. The main character having some psychological problems is really starting to make me wonder about Ms. Hill also. That subject pops up in some other books Ice Queen and Nature of Desire, which are excellent books with amazing writing by the way. The writing in Make Her Dreams Come True is also excellent writing but the story line, I personally didn't have the patience for.I wouldn't tell you not to read it especially if you enjoy good writing. This book just wasn't for me. I like instant gratification."
3,Not one of her better works,"Joey W. Hill is one of my favorite authors. Her books are erotic but her characters and settings are usually so well developed, even in paranormal books, that you really get involved with them and actually care what happens to them. They're neither all good nor all bad, like most real people. I actually cried during one of them, which given how much I read, is pretty remarkable. This story left me cold. The characters were single-faceted and pretty pathetic. I didn't care what happened to either of them, and the story line seemed ridiculous. I forced myself to finish it, but it was pathetic from such a wonderful writer."
4,"Commercial, or metal or heavy prog?","Made in JAP in 2000, Serial# TOCP-50911, Playing Time: 53 min.This album was originally released in 1994, and is this US band's first effort. The musical direction reminds me of DREAM THEATER's ""Images And Words"" album, but with vocals more in the vein of Jeff Scott Soto (early Malmsteen's Rising Force) with the frequent raunchiness of Graham Bonnet.Numerous tempo changes, off-the-chart guitar leads, sometimes harmonic, sometimes sheer speed. The CD is made up of 10 songs, most of which include both slow pounding beats and double-bassdrum rhythms. What I like about the tracks is they're like mini-epics, while the album has recurring themes.The production is a bit flat, but the arrangements are well constructed. If you like music that keeps you on your toes (the melody changes every 30 seconds) with great musicianship, similar to many bands on the Magna Carta label like MAGELLAN, SHADOW GALLERY and TILES, get this!"
4,Good first album.,"The band sounds great. This debut really shows what these guys are capable of. The only problem was the singing, which thankfully was worked out later anyway. I really didnt care for this guys vocals. I prefer their current vocalist Russell Allen. There's some cool guitar riffs on this courtesy of Micheal Romeo.I'm not going to go into attempts to sell potential new fans on Symphony X. Its your loss if you dont check them out."
5,Camera,So far so good the camera seems to be working great! No problems yet and hoping that this will conintinue
4,"Not quite deep enough to love, but hard not to like","A lovely, delicate wisp of a film, following moments over the course of a year in the lives of a small group of20 and 30 something friends, and the sickness and death of the oldest among them,their unofficial mentor, a writer who never quite succeeded.There's no real plot, and the emotions are never intense, but there's a lot of interesting fragments that add together to give a portrait of friends and lovers struggling to grow up and find their place in the world and with each other."
2,Slow evolving character development,This is your typical slow evolving character development film that tries to capture a slice of life. More down trodden than up lifting and not really reflective of my life or anybody elses that I know which is typical of most French Films.
5,Orthopedic,This pillow is fantastic especially for people who reads a lot during the day. It's supports my back so I do not have back pain anymore
3,Not As Pictured,Very nice pillow with a velvet feel / appearance - not Microfiber. The pillow is several shades darker than pictured. If you're after a maroon velvet pillow this is it.
2,I did not like it.,"You Can Become a Saint is well intentioned and at times it's almost profound but I didn't like it. The author uses a nagging, somewhat grouchy tone and except for those who are already well on the path to holiness it will probably turn most readers off. I much preferred Fr. Paul O'Sullivan's charming and lively, The Easy Way to Become a Saint. If you want something meatier try Introduction to the Devout Life by St. Francis DeSales."
1,This book is unrealistic in every sense of the word!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is supposed to be a sort of manual for being holy-instead it is totally unrealistic. I value my faith but I do not have 3-4 hours a day to say the rosary, pray and go to adoration. I ended up giving the book to St. Vincent de Paul-maybe there is an aspiring saint there who can put these lofty ideas into practice-it would have to be someone who doesn't work or have a life, though!"
5,I couldn't put it down,"I picked up this book by Laura Caldwell because i really did enjoy Burning the Map. This book was, in my opinion, very different. I enjoyed it even more. I loved the heroine, Kelly McGraw. She was such a real character to me. And I truly couldnt put the book down. I was enthralled the moment i picked it up. You couldnt help but root for Kelly. Like some of the other reviewers, I also wanted to know what happened to Kelly after the book ended.Pick up this book and you wont be disappointed."
4,Fantastic book!,"I loved this book! The story was writen to be very believable but it was a page turner at the same time. It proved that you can do whatever you want in your life, the past really dosen'y matter!"
2,"NOPE, Not the Original Recordings","The audio is OK, but it isn't the original recordings of the hits. You get what you pay for. Amazon should have disclosed this and I should have read the reviews. Thanks Keith!"
1,Eddy Raven is a wonderful country singer and songwriter - His original hits are on RCA,"These re-recording are pale in comparison with the RCA originals. Eddy Raven's original recordings are on RCA. His re-recordings on Curb do not compare to the RCA versions.Get the RCA CDs. They are much better.Eddy Raven is a wonderful country singer and songwriter, who can sing any type of song. He was on the Statler Brothers TV show as a regular for several seasons and had to sing pop from the 50's, 60's and 70's as well as country each week and he nailed them."
1,"Me, me, me","I was really hoping to gather more insight into advertising and promoting on the web.What I got was WAY TOO MUCH of the author's own references to himself, his site, and his personal bio.For someone who has no clue regarding marketing, advertising, PR, and the like this may be okay.But I think they would still pick up on 2/3 - 3/4 of the book dedicated to self."
3,"Not as good, Not recommended","This book is really compact and author tried to put just too much stuff in there, and seem like he tries to touch little bit of every subjects. And he wrote too much of his personal history instead of facts."
5,Wonderful!,I was pretty nervous on how well this product would hold up but it is wonderful - -My daughter uses this almost daily and it is durable and easy to clean.
4,Everything you'd want to know about kiwi birds,"This book has great photographs and lots of interesting facts about the New Zealand kiwis (flightless birds, not the fruit). Probably best for 6-9-year-olds."
3,good enough entry level or for the price. Padding is thin..,"the paddin prob is inadequate, for me.. even in cornersI am not sure if my laptop would survive a fall from a table height..But it will probably survive LESS than a foot drop."
2,Not very nice,"This bag is smaller than the dimensions that were advertised when I ordered it so I returned it without a hassle and Amazon paid for the return shipping. It looks like the dimensions have been updated. My HP G72 17.3"" laptop did not fit, but it was close. Even if it had fit there would have been no space for anything else."
4,Great job,This makes you want to go see him in concert. Great mix of songs and stories. Some good songs you can only get on this album.
1,An Artist In Search Of An Identity,"Volume does not equal prowess, and ego does not equal greatness, but if either did, this self-indulgent CD would be topping the Billboard charts and winning Grammies like it's creator once predicted he would.Charlie relies too heavily on cover songs and cuteness on this record, but really, that's what his once potent live show has relied on for way too long. Like his live show, this live album is a re-hash of the show I have seen a few too many times. No need to buy the record if you are a CR live show regular, and no need going to another live show if you already own this record.Same old Charlie, same old fair to midland stuff. Disappointing."
3,Helpful but lacks a real-world perspective,"In a workmanlike, if unexciting, literary style, Sellars provides a good deal of helpful information about the way the National Park Service has grown to maturity. Nevertheless, he lacks sufficient interest in the political world that has molded the NPS. (Disinterest in the public reaction to the 1988 Yellowstone fire is one indicator.) Had Mather, Albright, and the other founders of the Park Service not promoted tourism in their day, there would be less, not more, park ecology for ""dedicated scientists"" to manipulate in our own. As the author himself says, national park development is locked with preservation in a state of perpetual tension (181). May that tension long continue."
4,Hood Support Replacement,"The product works great, the fastening system was a little different than the factory unit, problem was there was no instruction, I had to use the old fasteners.I bought at Amazon and paid for express shipping but was delayed due to winter weather, if I knew that when I ordered I would have gone to my local auto parts store."
2,good part did not fit as shipped.,"recieved the part in good time, good quality, but one end did not fit, I was able to remove and replace the attachment ends as they both were threaded and then install part. thus my poor review. If the part had fit with out my retro fitting it I'd of given it 5 stars. Others may not be so adept to try what I did."
5,Great hood lift support,"What a great deal. I got two of these hood lift supports on Amazon for HALF THE PRICE of one hood lift support at the local parts stores.And with free shipping, it was too good to pass up.These popped right on in place of the old supports and they held up the heavy Ford Explorer hood perfectly.Great deal."
5,Great Deal,I used these to replace the hood struts on my 97 Ford Explorer. Fit perfectly although I unscrewed and switched the housings to match the way the old ones were installed. Works great and installation took seconds. No more propping my hood up with a broom handle!
5,Another Great Book,"This book is an easy-to-read novel that deals with the Civil War. It is quite informative and very interesting. By reading this book, I was able to have a whole new perspective and outlook on the Civil War. This book is one of the great ones!!! Definitely pick it up.."
5,One man's struggle to live and find his place,"Reconstructed Yankee is a novel set during the civil war, and it follows one man's struggle to live and find his place in a hostile world. Caleb Parker is one of 257,000 free persons of color living in the Confederacy; when war breaks out, he and his best friend enlist in the Union militia, yet Yankee atrocities force them to change sides and fight for the Confederacy. After the war, Caleb encounters extreme discrimination in reconstructed North Carolina; he takes his family to New York, hoping to find more tolerance, yet racism and segregation persist, leading him to ponder whether the bloody Civil War accomplished anything good at all. A harrowing and thought provoking insight into individual and societal failings and legacies."
5,KAWAII!,"I must say, I did not buy the dvds from Amazon but instead order the whole entire series and both movies in Japanese from a man in Singapore (they are subtitled in English.) CCS is such a kawaii show and the anime is awesome. I swear, CLAMP should be working for Disney because then Disney could have some good movies. Kero-chan is so naturally kawaii in the Japanese series. I love the series SO much but not in English. The English version is [bad] and the name changes stink. The Japanese version is the original and best!"
3,Only average; more childish than your typical anime film,"If you don't count the few moments featuring Madoushi the sorceress, there is nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, in this film for the adults. This isn't Princess Mononoke, or Street Fighter II, or Ghost in the Shell, or Akira. To be honest, this isn't even Pokémon. Apparently, ""adult entertainment"" was too hard, and extreme violence would have taken too much work, so this one struck strictly with the corny kiddy slop. Surprisingly, there's even less to Cardcaptor Sakura than there was to Laputa, and the animation isn't half as impressive."
3,the motion picture,"Sakura has won a trip to Hong Kong in a raffle! Yehey! Although her father is unable to go with her, Touya, Yukito, and Tomoyo decide to accompany her on her journey. Once there, however, ominous dreams plague Sakura while an evil force awaits to be unleashed upon the world once more!Once a mysterious book is opened, a powerful being draws Sakura and the others into a dangerous world. It seems that this being is searching for Captor Reed, the creator of Clow Cards, for revenge. Despite their attempts to speak with her, the being seems unwilling to listen to them, forcing a desperate battle to ensue.Despite the combined might of Sakura and Syaoran, this new opponent seems invincible. However, new allies are ready to help their cause as Syaoran's mother tries to save him from the enemy's clutches.I really didn't quite like the movie after seeing the 2nd movie of CCS but still you get to enjoy watching this movie!"
5,CCS in HongKong!,"This is supposed to be an awesome movie! ^^It's Sakura Kinomoto's winter break in Japan. She mysteriously wins a trip to HongKong! Li(Syaoran)-kun's and Meiling-chan's hometown! So Sakura-chan, Tomoyo-chan, Kero-chan, Yukito-san, and Sakura's Oni-chan(Touya) go to HongKong. But what challenges await Sakura?I suggest for any CCS fan in the USA to get it! It evan has the ""Cardcaptors"" version, uncut! If you are a CCS fan, GET IT and watch the japanese sub! If you are a CC fan, GET IT ALSO! Watch the dub voices and names uncut! Also, don't forget to see what the original is like!Personally, when I get it, I'm gonna watch both versions!"
3,cardcaptor movie,this movie is cool. i like it alot for any true ccs fans i recommend u to watch this.. plus this is the show's first movie
5,Thorough and fascinating,"The amount of detail and research that's in this book is astounding. This is not another coffee table picture book. Its filled with beautiful pictures, and an equal amount of readable, scholarly writing about a culture thats slowly getting lost to the west.Get it!"
1,Too much religion,"If you skip the religion parts and the stuff about Bodega Bay there are a few interesting passages. Overall, not worth much."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"Zero stars. Buying this book was a huge mistake. Nothing new on the Beatles, nothing interesting on the Beatles.It is merely, not so subliminal advertising on the good name of the Beatles. Mansfield spews his sickly sweet born again christian blather like a cheap red wine puke. Thank God it eventually ends.If I had the money, I would buy all copies and burn them to spare other unsuspecting Beatle fans and everyone else."
4,The Journey,"Ken Mansfield's book is a touching story of a man on a journey. A jouney of fame, fortune, sorrow and peace. A man who was close to one the most famous and well known musical groups of all times. I fell on to this book by accident, and I'm glad I did. The book's facts and pics of the fab four along with the personal stories and perspectives on the characters of the group is worth it alone to read the book. But that just gets your foot in the door. Ken as he is pouring out his heart and thoughts is pulling you into reaching for more insight, more intamacy and more of the Creator. A must read!"
1,Specious drivel.,"A Defense of Poetry is possibly the most irrelevant book I've ever read or even looked at. Paul Fry needs to rouse himself from his stupor and realize that his entire career has been a very long waste of time.The ""occasion"" of writing: how pretty!"
2,Sony MDR-RF950RK Not Very Impressive,"I got these headphones for my office so I could listen to music while I worked so that I wouldn't have to drag a cord around. Unfortunately, the sound quality was not very good.I have another pair of ear bud headphones that were about $14. They sound better than the cordless. There was a quiet hissing noise in the cordless phones that wasn't present with the cheap ear bud phones hooked up to the same source. And the dynamic range was muted on the cordless headphones; which is strange considering the nice dynamic range they advertise.Also, there was a lot of popping and stuttering when I turned my head or walked around. This occured no matter what channel of the three I used or how much I tried to tune it."
5,Great Easy to Read Detailed Map for the money,"This map comes standard with all of the good features you would expect in a road atlas, and then some. The large scale pages make both finding your destination and route a snap. The atlas divides most states into sections, which provide you with a more detailed view of the roads, and gives you a better idea of what route you should take. The atlas is also spiral bound, making it easier for you to flip the pages and find your route. This is a great buy for what you pay for it. 5+ stars."
4,wen...pretty good!,"wen...it seems to me that shampoo should cost about $3.00. i haven't tried it. it looks pretty cool! i like that it doesn't lather, and that it says that it doesn't strip your hair of its oils. my thoughts are that you should use baking soda, give it a few weeks of use to get used to it. if you have $30.00 some bucks to throw around at shampoo...cool, do it. but couldn't you spend it better towards other stuff? like save it up! i do love Alyssa Milano from the infomercials. i'd try (and i do) the baking soda, you can look it up online!"
1,yuck!,May hair did not feel clean at all after using this stuff. My BFF swears by it but I could not stand it.
1,Much better Shampoos out there for cheaper,"Haven't seen my hair looking this bad in a long time. Somehow Wen manages to make my hair both oily and frizzy. Horrible. Going back to my old shampoo, Raspberry Back to Basics. Half the price and actually makes my hair look good."
1,not for me,"i was so excited to find this product, but, just isn't right for me , made my hair heavy no matter how much i rinsed, and therefore by the end of the work day my hair looked greasy , yikes! it was aweful, i wish i could have returned it. i will give it another shot this summer, maybe just do the ends of my hair, what an expensive ""conditioner""... i hate that!"
1,Dried my hair our,I really really wanted this stuff to be great. I tried it for a little over a week and my hair just kept getting more dry and brittle. It got to the point of crunching. I don't know if it was the menthol or what. I have seen so many reviews where it was the best thing for their hair. Wish it could have been true for me. Just wasn't in the cards I suppose.
3,Not for every hair type,"This is my second purchase of Wen and I am so-so about recommending the product. I met a young lady in the airport and we actually sat on the plane together from Charlotte, NC to Philly and her natural hair was stunning. I was just starting to grow out my natural hair and desperately wanted it to look as good so I inquired about the product she used. She recommended Wen. But after using the product most everyday and according to the instructions, I get comments from friends about how dry my hair appears. It's soft to the touch but has no luster, if you know what I mean. I am not bashing Wen at all. I am just suggesting that you try it but don't believe the hype about good for every hair type. It may or may not work for you depending upon what you desire from the product."
3,"Loving it, but loosing it","I've been using the product for several months, loving the way it leaves my hair!!! The only concern I am having is that my hair is coming out off on my hands when I am latheirng it through. Finding some in the drain every time, I have short hair and I never noticed this when I was using regular shampoo.... should I stop using it? Is this normal? Anyone else having the same results???"
3,Not the Miracle,I've used when for about 6 months. My hair continues to be very frizzy with Wen and I find I have to use other products to tame it. I have fine naturally wavy hair. The best perk of this version of Wen is I grew new hair like crazy. I almost stopped using it thinking my hair was breaking. The stylist confirmed it was new growth and there was so much of it we had to layer my hair to blend it in. She guessed the tea tree oil was stimulating my scalp. Now my husband's using it who is loosing his hair. I'll keep you posted on the results. I have switched to the knock of Hair One after 5 months and I must say I think it works better for my hair as it needs a little dimethicone to keep out the frizz.
1,Made my scalp worse,"I purchased the tea-tree WEN because it was supposed to help my sensitive scalp. It aggravated whatever it is that's going on with my scalp and made it worse than it's ever been before. I used it 3 weeks ago, and I'm still trying to get my scalp to calm down. (But, it did make my hair feel nice---dirty smelling, but it felt and behaved nicely.)"
2,Great idea but not always for mixed hair,"I had been told to try Wen for my daughter by friends who were white and black. My daughter is mixed and I find it hard to find a product that works with her hair. I had not realized that my daughter truly had mixed hair. When using this product her hair looked even worse than before. Some parts of her hair went soft and straight and others became tight ringlets. Since her hair is not all one type it didn't work for her. I tried it multiple times to just see if her hair had to become used to it. On a plus her hair was clean, smelled good, and the product didn't dry out her hair or leave it oily like others we have tried. Also the first months supply didn't even last four washes."
3,great smell,"Has a great smell. It is very heavy feeling even after its washed out of my hair, make my hair oily"
2,Wen Cleansing conditioner,"This made my hair feel weighed down. Also you have to use so much of it (sixteen pumps at one time) that it doesn't last very long, it's too expensive to buy so often."
4,Change of heart,"I've used 3 different Wen products over the last 3 months and I've been very satisfied with the condition of my hair. I have long straight hair and it gets oily after just one day so I wash my hair every day. I need something that will clean my hair at the roots and won't dry out the ends. When trying the Tea Tree for the first time, I was unhappy with the scent (smelled like tires) I put it away until I ran out of my other scents (Lavender and Sweet Almond Mint). When I used it again, I found it gave me better results, more moisturizing, less fly-away hair, was clean at the roots and the smell didn't stay after my hair dried. I guess you just get used to it. Now Tea Tree is my favorite."
4,Wen,"Love this hair product. since i use this product my hair is not too fussy and dry anymore, but the only negative thing is I have to use the regular shampoo first before i use this Wen cleansing otherwise I feel like my sculp is not clean. Would recomand to anyone."
5,To Have and to Hold FOREVER and EVER....,"Absolutely a winner! Especially with natural hair. My resolve for 2008 was to go natural. This product is aiding me in transitioning from chemically processed treated hair to my natural (ethnic) coif. I use it on average 2-3 days a week at the recommended amount. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and CLEAN. To increase lather and malleability add more warm water. I am still on the first bottle (16 oz.) and by all accounts will not exhaust it until late April. All I can say it REALLY works for me."
1,Not for my hair,"Maybe this works for a lot of people, but I have hair that normally has to be washed every day to keep the scalp clean and hair smelling fresh. I used this product for a couple of weeks exactly as described and although it did make my hair look nice after using, it did not get my scalp clean and it actually did not smell clean. It was as if it did not get out enough of the dirt and oil. Definitely expected better results at this price."
1,Any conditioner can be used to clean your hair,"The infomercial makes this conditioner sound like some kind of revolutionary product, but in reality, you can ""shampoo"" your hair with conditioner from a drugstore that costs 2 dollars a bottle. Conditioners usually contain gentle surfactants, so if you apply them liberally to your scalp and scrub with the pads of your fingers as if you're shampooing, work it through the ends of your hair, and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes before rinsing (basically, the same routine that you would use with Wen), your hair will be clean and shiny but not stripped.However, this product contains 'cones (such as Trimethylsilylamodimethicone) which build up on your hair and seal out moisture unless you use a harsh shampoo to remove them. Cheap drugstore brands like V05, Suave, and White Rain do not contain 'cones, and thus they are actually better options for someone that doesn't wish to use sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate on their hair. Don't waste your money."
3,expected better,"I expected a bit more after reading the glowing reviews. For me, the cleansing conditioner made my scalp oily, so I switched back to my normal routine after using Wen three times. I bought the Tea Tree type, so I might try the other types in hopes that they may work better for my hair/scalp - I have curly hair."
5,Wen Tea Tree,I love Wen...I have psoriasis in my scalp and have been treated by a dermatologist. I have used several medications including oil treatments which have to stay on overnight. I started using Fig Wen about 6 months ago and noticed a significant improvement. Then my hairdresser told me about Tea Tree and I tried it and I am thrilled...my hair and scalp are so much better...almost all dry patches and scaling are gone and my hair is so soft and manageable. I will never go back to shampoo.
2,Did not like this product,I didn't like this product one bit. I bought another product direct from the Wen website and it was very different. I didn't like either though. This product is not good on chemically treated or relaxed hair.
1,save your $,This product is a rip off! I get the same results using my redken all soft shampoo and conditioner. My hair has not improved like the seller/ product promises. I guess I have fallen victim to the idea that if a celebrity promises they love a product then it must be great! Now I understand why they have so much disposable income!! Save your money and use it on a treatment for your hair at your favorite salon!
3,welll,"eh, i don't know how i feel about it really, so far it smells good and my hair is pretty soft. but i don't see any fantastic changes from how it was before i started using it. this is only after my 3rd use of the product."
4,Ok shampoo,This shampoo is ok if you don't wash your hair like every other day it gets really greasy and nasty looking. The smell is nice and it feels good on my head. Also it doesn't last 30 days if you wash your hair every day. I do have to say it work great on my daughters hair and she has very dry hair and make her hair very soft.
3,interesting,"I'm sure for someone with dry hair this would be wonderful. I have oily hair, so adding more oil isn't working. I am using it as a regular conditioner after a normal lathering shampoo and it works great that way."
3,No noticeable difference,"Well, I ordered this because I must have seen the infomercial on TV a trillion times already and they finally broke me down enough to try it. I didn't dislike it, but didn't notice any difference in my hair from using my regular shampoo and conditioner. It's too expensive to buy again, but I would certainly do it if they ever start selling it at a cheaper price - it takes less time for sure and the smell is pleasant. It left my hair as shiny as always and it felt soft and manageable too....but then again, my regular products do the same thing."
2,Boo hiss... another miss,"After hearing a few people rave about how wonderful Wen was I ordered some for myself and was eagerly awaiting the day it arrived. I got a shower that night and used it per the instructions. I didn't have the wow factor after it dried and my hair seemed much more greasy after the fact. I thought maybe I didn't do it right and tried it again... with the same results and this time my neck and back is covered in acne as well (which I haven't had since I was about 16). I'm really bummed that this didn't work but not so much considering the cost.My hair is long, very thick and somewhat wavy. I typically wash it about once every 4-5 days (normally my hair isn't greasy and doesn't like being washed much)."
3,great conditioner,"I do like this product for a conditioner and a leave in treatment, but I still have to pair it with a shampoo. I used this product and only this product for 3 weeks. My hair got really greasy, and I started to develope white flakes (you know like when your hair is dirty). I followed the instructions and watched the ""how to videos"" on the website so I know I used it right. I wish this product was the one stop wonder product for my hair as described on the WEN site, but it just isn't. Although I have to pair it with a shampoo I will still continue to use the product as a conditioner and leave in treatment. It definitely made my hair have less breakage, less frizz, and I just have all around better hair days with it!"
3,Just an O.K. shampoo,The shampoo is O.K. but doesn't live up to the hype they give it.Think they want you to buy other products go with it to ensurethat you have that lovely hair you see on the infomercials.
5,hair miracle,"Very good product. I noticed an improvement in my hair from the first time I used this product. After 1 week, even my co-workers where asking what I had done to my hair. Very satisfied with it and actually re-ordered already."
5,Greatest thing to happen to my hair!!!,"These products have changed my hair, the texture body and overall apperance. I was skeptical at first. With the first use, I was sold!! Never have I used any product like this. I have used the best and expensive salon brands. I would shampoo twice, condition, detangle. Let's not forget protector before blow drying. Now I use Wen once and cleanse my hair. Then finish with a 1/4 of original use. For mine, 10 pumps, my hair looks fabulous!! My best friend, also didn't believe it until she tried it. Now she too, will not use anything else om her hair. My hair is fine and long, never has been chemically treated. Where my friend's hair is also fine, but damaged by coloring and chemical treatment. I have passed it on to other friends, whose hair needs help and a change."
2,very dissapointed. expensive hype.,"I'd been using the Sweet Almond Mint Wen for about a month prior to this purchase. Wanted to get the Tea Tree formula to help with winter hair...dry, flaky scalp. The scent of this is so/so, but more importantly...it simply does not work. Not only did it not help with scalp issues, I had to wash my hair every single day or it would become very oily. Sebastian Tea tree shampoo/conditioner is much more effective for scalp issues. Don't waste your hard earned money on this...not worth it."
2,Not impressed,"I really wanted this stuff to be as good as the infomercials say it is. It smelled medicinal, which I expected, and the smell did go away after rinsing, so that was fine. It did leave my hair soft, but it did not clean my hair. I gave it as long as I could stand it (just over two weeks) figuring maybe I'd get used to it or it would get better. My boyfriend didn't like it either. It did seem to help his dandruff/itchy scalp, but left him with oily hair too. I have long, thin, fine hair and he has long, thick, wavy hair so I was hoping this stuff would work for one or both of us, but that just wasn't the case. Overall, a disappointing purchase that I wouldn't recommend."
1,disappointed,I really had great hopes for this product. It had been several weeks and I don't notice any improvement in my hair. I have always used high quality hair product so Im thinking that those who dont might notice a difference and rave about this product. For the rest of us maybe no change at all. I wont by again.
2,Oily ones beware,"Well, I'd read a review on here before I ordered this stating that she'd had oily scalp and this made it worse. I should have listened. My hair looked really dirty and my scalp itched like crazy. I ordered the tea tree specifically for my oily scalp. I don't know if another formula would have worked better, but I'm not taking the chance."
1,WEN ruined my hair too,I purchased the smaller bottle of this product and was at first very happy with the way my hair felt and looked. I finished the bottle and purchased the larger bottle and I wasn't even able to get through half of it when I noticed how dry the product was making my hair (it looked and felt like straw) and the build up on my scalp was unbelievable! I have stopped using the product over 2 months ago and am still suffering the consequences. My hair is naturally thick and cutly and has always been in very good condition. I dread the day I purchased this product. Good luck if you decide to try it.
1,not so smooth,"THis is the second time I bought Wen. This time I bought the green tea kind. My hair was not silky smooth at all. Maybe the formula is different than in the almond mint kind I used 2 years ago. I used it maybe 5-6 times just to make sure - but I don't like what it did to my hair - they were coarse and dull. I'd like to try the almond mint wen again and see if the results would be different, but this product is so expensive. I'll pass."
3,Good but too expensive,"This review will basically compare Wen to Hair One (from Sally Beauty Supply). I like Hair One fairly well, so I decided to spend more to get the Wen product hoping it would control my frizz better than Hair One. They are nearly the same product, and I like Wen a little bit better than Hair One, but Wen is way more expensive, so I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost. Wen seems silkier than Hair One, and it seems to absorb better into the hair than Hair One. I also like the smell of Wen a little better than the comparable Hair One. However, neither Hair One nor Wen do anything for smoothing my coarse, frizzy hair. I have slightly wavy, thick shoulder-length hair. After using the Wen, my hair does feel clean and conditioned, but I still have to use extra product to keep it smooth. Therefore, I won't reorder Wen simply because it is too pricey."
3,Tea Tree Cleanser,"This worked great for itching scalp, as promised. However, it left my hair limp and oily looking. I may have used too much so I am beginning to cut back on the quantity and not leaving-in any product to see if it makes a difference."
5,Love how my hair looks,"WEN Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner 16ozI have never written a review before but I have to for this product. I have watched the infomercial, researched the product and finally decided to try it.I have been using Wen for about 10 days now and what a difference in my salt and pepper hair (more salt than pepper). Gray hair is course and kind of unruly and since using Wen, it is much more manageable and softer.I have a very hard time with breaking out with many shampoos, which is why I was hesitant to order, but I have had no breakouts on my scalp and my itchy scalp is gone!I will certainly continue to use Wen products. I may change flavors as the Tea Tree smells quite medicinal, but once your hair is dry it is okay."
4,A delightful diversion,Very good classic science fiction. Parts are a bit creaky but overall it has held up very well as a good read. And the price is right.
1,Poor Quality Golf Mat,"This golf mat did not cost much, but it is not worth much. The mat is very light weight. Every time a ball is hit from the mat, the mat moves. Do not buy this product, you will not be happy."
1,anything but heavy-duty,"Only after one practice (maybe 50 balls), the rubber practice tee broke. And the mat is very light weight, when my club hit the mat, it slide on the ground a lot (I practice in the garage with a concrete floor)."
2,Wilson Golf Chip and Drive Mat,It's small and the edges are loose causing the grass to fall off of it when you pick it up. Don't know how long it will last.
2,small and defective,"I did a couple of swings. Afterwards, the mat was shrunk. I'm thinking to return it."
1,cheep product for the money,"I would like to return the peoduct I feel forthe money the product is not worth $20.00 I am suprized Amazon would approve this item Please send a return authorization to Greg Hutchens 19119 rogers rd. Odessa,fl. 33556Thnak youGreg hutchens"
1,don't waste your $$,"Purchased this because of the reasonable price...should have suspected what you get for $20. after hitting several balls the mat's meshed backing started to seperate from the foam rubber base, the grass surface started to seperate from the foam rubber. spend the extra $$ to get your $$ worth."
1,Felt Cheated,Felt cheated after buying this mat. It was so light that when I did the chipping the whole piece of mat flew off with the ball. Below of the mat was made of foam. Cannot hold the hitting. Very disappointed.I used the door mat better than this mat. Bad Bad Bad!!!!
1,wilson golf mat,"Product is flimsey but will work ok if you punch another hole in the middle and use the 2 outer hole to secure the mat with stakes, also buy some decent rubber tees from the sporting goods store because the included split tee will soon fail at the splits better off just to just forget this mat and buy a heaverier front door mat punch a hole in it and and purchase some rubber tees from the sporting goods store."
3,Okay if for indoor use,"I bought this with a practice net -- in case my husband / son wanted to use the net inside. Works okay for that (comes folded so it takes some time to ""level out""); but, it doesn't work in the grass so my lawn continues to suffer."
1,do not buy,"cheap foam bottom, you need to use a normal tee inside the rubber one, would not stay flat with light wind it's just horrible. buy something with a solid base and a rubber tee that does not need a wood tee."
3,Soft and Memorable,"Great to end a day and relax. Beautiful, innocent and caressing. Makes one feel in love and safe.Not a single insensitive note or chord. Makes the piano a cradle for your dreams."
5,Amazing!,"I have been looking for a quality 8x writer, and then has been the best I have seen. I work with a local editing company in Indiana, and I needed a personal burner and this one is top notch. In a matter of 5 minutes it was hooked up, and I had burnt my first home movie in 15-20 minutes. I was shocked at how quick and easy this product was. I use my PC firewire port, with a combonation or 8x and 4x DVD-r media and I am very happy with my purhcase. I reccomend it too all."
1,a total disaster,"There were several problems with the product I received:1. no power cord. I had a spare, so I used my own. I connected the drive to a USB port, used the DVD drive to install the software and everything seemed fine. Until...2. the drive wouldn't recognize any DVDs. I tried two Verbatim DVD+R discs and neither was recognized. So, I got a commercial video DVD and a DVD-R produced by a friend. Nothing.3. I called the Amazon partner dealer who sold me the drive. They said that they have had a lot of returns on this piece. Mostly due to the missing power cord, but the rep didn't know whether anyone else had gotten a DVD drive that wouldn't even recognize DVDs.They're sending a UPS return label and I'm returning it."
2,Not nearly as loud as others.,The sound is just not that loud or piercing as the oval ones from radio shack or the door-stop alarms. Those models hurt my ears. This alarm sound is also too high pitched to be very effective.
4,Another very very fun adventure in time!,"This is another really great sequel to Back To The Future. This time we pick up right after the end of Part 2 in 1955. After the Doc was accidentaly sent back to 1885 Marty must get the 1955 Doc to help him get back to the future, 1985. Doc has burried the Delorean in an abandon cave from 1885. But Marty finds out that Mad Dog Tannen, the Biff of the old west murders the Doc. Marty now has to go back to 1885 with the help of 1955 Doc to save the Doc from death. Equal to Part 2, but again its missing that comedic charm we saw in Part 1. It also has some chessy jokes. But its still another very exciting adventure in time. I suggest you see Pats 1 and 2 first! Rated PG for language and some violence"
3,All right,"The first sequel to Back to the Future was top-notch and well-written. This one... not so much. Sure, it's not without it's bad parts. However, this movie feels more tacked-on than the first sequel, especially with the fact that many of the characters play dual roles, including Tannen in the role of his ancestor 'Mad Dog' who antagonizes Marty's ancestors - it would have been better if completely different characters had been introduced instead of recycling. If you liked the first two movies, you may enjoy this one, just don't expect it to be as good."
5,open season 2,i really enjoyed the continuing story of these animals. its very funny. my children really liked the story and the music.
4,Final (Let's hope not ...) part of 'Future'-films,"The third installment in the Back to the future-trilogy is a love story and an ending, with boring passages, but still that magical touch of Spielberg/Zemeckis, that makes a movie charming. Fox is back as Marty (...and Seamus McFly), Lloyd as Doc, ther're a nice duo and they form a nice movie, for generations to come. But ... why did they changed the original Jennifer into Elisabeth Shue ?"
3,Blast To The Old West,"Third time may be a charm, but not with this film series. While this movie is good, the other two are far better than this. Anyway, after Doc is sent to the Old West, Marty goes back to rescue him. Along the way, Doc gets a girlfriend, and Marty gets in trouble with Biff's anscestor, the local ruffian. The train seen at the end is cool, though.The acting is still good, but the jokes are worn out by now. This movie is definitly not terrible, it is good, just not as good as the other two. If you liked the first two, see this one too."
2,An Indulgent Threequel That Never Quite Arrives,"This is the point where the dam breaks for the BTTF trilogy. Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table. Where the original was able to effortlessly skirt the holes that speckled its plot, the saga's grand finale bowls straight through them with no regard for the repercussions, leaving audiences skeptical. A needless leap across both genre and era, at least it has the dignity to close the door behind it when the credits queue."
2,A weak sequel but still enjoyable to watch!,I enjoyed the first two a lot but the third one seems to be weak. It's nothing close like the first two and the plot didn't seem to make sense to me. The ending was cool but I sure wish they made a BTTF 4 but BTTF 3 seems to be the end of the series. The acting is not bad though but I didn't see any similarities with the first two it was just a newer adventure where they go cowboy but it's still fun to watch if your a BTTF fan.
2,Haven't we been here before?,"An improvement on part 2, this second follow-up nevertheless retains some of it's predecessor's weaknesses; most annoyingly, the repetition of scenes from the original. Also, Zemeckis again resorts to a Chuck Jones and Tex Avery approach (doesn't every ""family"" film-maker these days?). Thomas F. Wilson's character, particularly, evolved from Biff in part 1, to Bluto in part 2, and wound up somewhere past Yosemite Sam in part 3. For all that, at least you can follow the plot and care about the characters, which is more than you can say for part 2. Best advice, though, is: STICK TO THE ORIGINAL!"
2,HORIBLE BAD SEQUEL,I LOVED THE FIRST TWO MOVIES BUT I HATED THIS FOR ONE THING I HATE WESTERNS THIS ONE WAS NOT ANTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO THE PLOT DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE JUST SEE THE FIRST TWO DO NOT SEE THIS ONE
4,Oldie but Goodie,"So, I watch it 25 or so years later and we see how far cinema has come. All the weirdness of the 80's comes back to haunt you, but its still a great three part series to watch. Ends well too."
5,LEB,A GOOD MIXTURE OF ACTION AND COMEDY.....LOVED IT. THE FIRST IN THE SERIES. I AM A FAN OF M J FOX
3,"Compared to part II, it's 7th heaven.","Although, not as original and flawless as part 1, Back to the Future 3 is a worthy sequel to part II, if only because it was impossible to make a sequel as atrocious as part II.The story is similar to part I in that Michael J. Fox goes back in time and that most of part 3 ALSO takes place in the past, but THIS time it's a much older era that he travels back to (the 1800's) and the setting is in the old West.The story and plot aren't as original or as fresh as the first Back To The Future, but part 3, nonetheless does provide a fairly entertaining combination of action and comedy that throughout, and the movie only becomes more interesting, suspenseful, and exciting as it progresses. All in all, a better than average movie, but not spectacular or excellent."
5,Fantastic book for parents,I loved this book-- very easy to read and very easy to understand Sensory Processing Disorder. Lots of helpful hints and interesting treatment suggestions. Thanks!
5,clear and explanatory,"I've read other books - the classic ""Out-of-Sync Child"" stands out - but Lucy Jane Miller's ""Sensational Kids"" was by far the clearest. Once I read it I understood why each child with sensory processing disorder is so different from each other. It should be required reading for all parents, teachers and caregivers of SPD kids!"
5,Required reading!,"As a pediatric OT in private practice, this is the book I have been waiting for. I read it cover to cover in one sitting, so captivated by Lucy's clear descriptions and explainations of a subject that can sometimes seem overwhelming to parents and teachers. My copy now has a prominent place in our waiting room and is already dog-eared. If ever a book deserved to be on a ""required reading"" list for anyone who knows a ""sensational kid"", this is it!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I wanted a book that would give my child tools to live in this world. However, this book talks about how to make this world conform to my child. What happens when my child is in an stimulating environment and Mom is not around? I was looking for - wear earplugs while doing homework - something practical I can use. I can't always make my other two children be quiet for long periods. This world is a distraction; my child must cope with reality.. somehow or not be successful in accomplishing his hopes and dreams."
3,Wildly overrated,"I live in New York City. Sensory integration disorder, or whatever it is called today, is on the tips of every educator and child psychologist's tongue. We've known this about our daughter since she was three, and have gotten excellent services.I turned to this book not to confirm the diagnosis, but for some simple, straight forward tools, tricks and tips for how to deal with my daughter's difficulties.If you're looking to understand disorder and where your child may or may not fit in, this book is ideal. If you already accept the diagnosis and want to know what to do when you're at home with five minutes to leave the house so everyone will be on time and your child freaks out because there are four grains of sand from the trip to the beach in the pair of shoes that she's settled on wearing even though there are four other perfectly acceptable pairs, then keeping looking for another book."
2,Disappointing!,"I was so disappointed in this book. It was just full of endless anecdotes, and really didn't offer much in the way of useful information. This is such an important topic, and I do not need touchy-feely superficial sympathy. I want to know how to help my child with concrete information."
1,Too Slow,It took me forever to get my book. I didn't get it until a month after the latest that I should have gotten it. After trying to get my money back and cancelling the order then my book came once it was too late and I had already borrowed it from someone else. This seller seems to be full of excuses.
1,Worst French textbook,"This textbook was required for a course I gave to language teachers in French. I didn't choose it. I would never have chosen it. The pictures were so bad, everyone ended up laughing. The French really being taught wasn't terribly useful, and the ""story line"" was downright boring. The grammatical explanations were sketchy, but the very worst thing about the book was that it was so ho hum. I tried the book again with a long-time student, and he lasted about 3 lessons before he dozed off. Facon de parler is not the French facon. They are a very interesting people, even when they're just talking about mushrooms, and this book far from does them justice."
2,"Great game, but franchise mode freezes up","I loved ESPN NHL 2k4, and, at first glance, ESPN 2k5 is even better. There are many game play improvements like swiping at the puck on defense and more control over fighting. The addition of scouting both prospects and players is an interesting concept that is cool in theory, but doesn't really pan out in reality.The fatal flaw in this game is that there is a bug that causes the game to freeze when you are playing in franchise mode. This is a widely experienced bug (check ESPN and Gamespot news groups) that has not been addressed by the developer.I love this game, but franchise play is the way to go. I am going to sell it and go back to ESPN 2k4."
2,A huge disappointment!,"This is the first game I have seen where the graphics are worse than in the previous version. One big advantage of the NHL2K4 was the good graphics compared to the EA-Sports NHL games. I could have lived with the same graphics and improved gameplay in the new version, but taking a couple steps backwards with the graphics are just too much: Stay with the NHL2K4!"
2,The graphics keeps on freezing while playing season mode,"The graphics , sounds and extras are great , but just like the previous year ,for some reason while playing on season mode I get stuck for no reasons while trying to play a game .In last years the game froze in the middle of the season while playing a towards the end of a game all of the sudden it seems that the laser was stuck on something , and on this year it happened again ,but this time when I tried to start a game in the middle of november. Starting to regret buying this game.Someone from Sega really needs to look into these problems.."
2,FANS... WAIT! READ THIS!,"I am amazed at the negative votes on the reviews that say this game freezes! I, along with numerous other gamers across both the Xbox and PS2 platforms, are experiencing significant locking up with the game in Franchise mode. There are currently threads on the ESPN videogames official message board site about the problem. The main thread has over 12 TWELVE pages of individuals writing in with their own specific lock-up problems!!! This cannot be ignored!I made the switch over from EA Sports to ESPN NHL Hockey (2k4) last year. This year, with the $19.99 price, there was no question! I was staying with 2k5. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!Please heed this warning and review this situation for yourself before making the decision to purchase this game. ESPN won me over in 2k4, but I'm going back to EA Sports after this. I'd rather pay $50 for a game that I can play than $20 for one that freezes. I haven't played my 2k5 for months now."
4,Beset hockey game for gameplay,"Last year I bought both NHL 2005 for the PC and 2k5 for Xbox. There are things I like in both games, though from just a hockey gameplay stand point you can't beat this.NHL 2005 was visually stunning. The player models look so much more realistic than what you see in NHL 2K5. The players, especially the goaltenders look like boxes to me with heads. The body does not look good at all. I will say the faces for the most part do look like they are suppose to be.On the other hand, the game play is much more how you would play a real hockey game. The defenders are smarter, the other players on your team are smarter. The extras are better with the skybox, and historic teams. The cut scenes during intermission are better, and the voice work is by far the best around. If they could combine the graphics of EA's and the gameplay of 2k, it would make the perfect hockey game."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this book thinking that it might have some information that would be useful in meeting women. She just talks in generalities. She talks about taking showers and wearing clean underwear. Things that guys already do and are common sense. What she doesn't talk about is what really works with women.
1,Does the author even know ANY women??,"I don't personally know women like this. Maybe this should be titled ""how to get a flighty, fanciful crybaby in bed"". The women I know are pretty straightforward, self sufficient and well, pretty logical. I'd like a book on how to appeal to that type of woman - cause this wasn't it. It really didn't give advice. It never really tells you how to get the woman you want but tells the idiotically obvious i.e. don't act like a schmuck, dress well, take a bath. The book is similar to ""how to succeed with women"" which was a complete farce. The author has a degree in psychology - and we all know what a worthless basket weaving degree that is."
3,Not what was expected,"I suppose for how much this cost I was expecting something really luxurious and comfortable. Well, the blankets binding (pink outer edge) is thick and seems to be the type that will last a while, the purple ""cotton candy"" portion of the blanket is soft but really looks like poodle or even lamb hair. It seems really hairy to me and not really the type of thing I would give my infant since like most babies everything goes in her mouth and I worry that this ""hairy"" appearance might end up being like hair in my babies mouth."
4,Looks good...,"Hi, I recently started looking for a new pair of sony headphones and stumbled across this set. I have had a pair of sony mdr-v4 then even better mdr-7504 and was quite impressed. However I started using sony headphones that covered the entire ear which were more comfortable, especially if you wore glasses. I expect these headphones to be very sweet. I looked around at places like hifibitz.co.uk and found amazon to have a very competitive price. A great choice for the headphone enthusiast."
3,Um..........,"These earphones are friggin awesome, but don't buy them unless you need them for a special purpose, or you just got money to throw away......."
5,Mother of 5,"This is an excellent book for teaching the spiritual basics of the universal truths. I have 5 children ages 18, 13,11,9,8. All of them have benefited from this book. This book has helped me explain truths that I could not put in the right words. Mary Summer Rain speaks so well to young minds as well as to adult minds. The pictures are on a childrens level so that where they dont at first understand the words, they can look at the pictures and get an idea of what is being said. By the second time around in the book my children were all understanding. I make this book a nightly bedtime reading. She has broken down the truths in small digestable pieces just enough for understanding. What a wonderful gift we give our children to help them understand and to heal our land. They are the age of peace and harmony."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I had read such glowing reviews for this book, and was disappointed when I ordered my own copy. The simple line art illustration wasn't to my liking and while the book had interesting chapters on dreams, visualization, and wish craft, I found it's basic theology to be inappropriate for my Pagan belief system. I believe in the multiplicity of deity, and was surprised that this book was very monotheist, stressing ""one God"" who ""has a plan for our lives."" I would recommend this book for those following a New Age, or Mystical Christian path, but not those raising their children on a Pagan path."
5,To the very end,This movie was awesome. I have to say it's one of the best Cardcaptors product ever.
3,Hmm...I prefer the Cardcaptor Sakura movies better...,"Well, to tell you that, I haven't watch the dubbed version of Cardcaptors the movie yet. But I have watch the Cardcaptor Sakura movie. They both have to same plot, but the CCS movie (original) is way better than ANY american dubbed anime...in the dub, they left out the hints of Syaoran (Li) and Sakura + also had cut many scenes that were suppose to be funny. Anyways, I have watched to first subbtitle movie of CCS, and I recommand this *original* movie to Cardcaptors and CCS fans. Also if they're planning to released the second movie...(hmm, maybe not cuz it's a Sakura+Syaoran movie, they screw this one up ALOT in the tv series, so it's not gonna happen...hehe ;)) I also preffer the subbtitle...^_^"
1,here we go again..-.-,"Before you go and judge Cardcaptors, see the original japanese series, Cardcaptor Sakura. It's cuter, more understandable, and just plain better.Don't waste your money on the dub."
4,Cool movie~,"...i love the movie and all but there are not many S&S moments (sakura and syaoran...Alot of action, comedy, drama, a little horror..."
3,watch it anyway...,"if you r a cardcaptor fan, watch it. Sakura wins a trip to hongkong (not by chance, it was intended), syaoran and meiling's hometown. i watched the japanese language and could atually understand it. but if i were you, waste no time on the english version series of cardcaptor. it misses out plenty of details about sakura and syaoran! watch the original, not dubbed one and you'll find you enjoy it much much better...and tryta find second cardcaptor movie while you're at it...i rate it ..."
5,KOOL OR WHAT!,"I love this movie and it is hilarious,especially the plane bit where tori tells Sakura she isn't allowed to wear shoes on the plane and...you get the picture! well earned 5 stars"
4,Wow - interesting film,"The first thing to remember is that this is a Euro/French film. Hence do not expect the Director to hold your hand and explain every twist and turn of the story. The French Directors seem to believe that audiences are more intelligent than the average bear. Therefore they do not always tie off all the loss ends or explain the presence of every character in the film. They expect the audience to work out what is going on. And in this film you will have to WORK to figure it out. That said, the film is beautifully acted and artistically put together. It is really a filming of a graphic novel - something along the vein of Frank Miller's Sin City. If you like surrealist sci-fi - e.g. Twelve Monkeys and Fifth Element -Immoral is definitely worth a look."
5,totally loved it!!,"What an awesome movie!! Loved it. It spoke to many of us plain janes who looked into a mirror while shimmying to the music. Later, she was as captivated by the sparkle of the sequins, the flow of the silk and the excitement of the stage as many us are. The humor was great, the women's issues were interesting and the ""belly dance cabaret"" topic was clearly handled. I recommend it."
4,Good story - doesn't do much for Belly D,"On the bright side, the music is very good, and the story is very good though perplexing. However, as Belly Dancer myself, I find the situations insulting to my profession. I've danced professionally for 20 years, and everywhere I've danced, the dancers were treated like family, and acted like family. It's too bad directors keep making belly dancers look bad..."
4,loved it,"This movie is of a genre which I don't really enjoy all that much, but I truly enjoyed this. There are very few films that show middle aged women in a sexual way, and when they do it's either because they're made to look more like 17 year olds than their age, or their sexuality is made to look like a big joke. This film shows a middle aged widow with a college-aged daughter rediscovering her sexuality. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because the mother has a relationship with the daughter's boyfriend which comes off as a little wacky, but don't let that stop you from watching this movie. The glimpse it provides of North African Arabic culture is also interesting."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"I have been researching the discrimination faced by the Aboriginal people for several years. Until I found this book, I'd never seen any book that I thought accurately portrayed the situation. The book is excellent. It contains general information about important issues and has very detailed sections for each state/territory. It is a necessity for anyone interested in the Aboriginal history and culture!"
4,good product,"I have no complaints. Simplifies a lot of doctrinal differences between denominations into a compact form, but it is not nearly as comprehensive as other works. Would recommend as a pocket guide, but if the words 'pocket guide' were excluded from the title, I would have given this book a negative rating because it is not comprehensive as other books."
2,not too thrilled,"not recommended for women. too heavy and bulky. great space, but not lady like at all. try the targus laptop blacktop case with dome protection. same space lightweight more appealing look and style. I'm very pleased with this one instead."
4,Reasonable Intro to Medical Informatics,"I have used this book for an intro. course and found it to be a reasonable beginner book. Medical Informatics is a broad topic to say the least, and any book attempting to summarize it will suffer from the task.This book is slightly dated, but has a helpful web site.If you want a broad exposure to MI then this is not a bad place to start."
4,An interesting twist on Sci-fi meeting Swords & Sorcery,"More of a 7 than an 8, nevertheless I've probably read this book five or six times over the years. I do enjoy its new Slant on the theme of technology meets fantasy. Its sequel, the Wizard and the War Machine is about a 6 to a 7. Much more entertaining was The Misenchanted Sword. A real good read, about a 9"
3,"An early book, not quite up to his usual level.","An interesting premise, but the writing is a little too overstyled."
3,pH Litmus Test Strips,"I purchased these to test the acidity of BBQ sauce that I planned to can for long term storage. The test strips are easy to use, though the tomato product in the sauce stained the litmus paper, putting the accuracy of reading the results of the test strips in question. This is a decent product, though I think you would be limited to testing products less colorful then a tomato based product."
2,Not her best,I preferred the earlier books in the series. This one has too many characters. I had to force myself to finish it. Not recommended.
3,Could have been better,"As someone who lives in the fictional city of Los Santos, OK, OK, I don't live in that city but it was inspired by the actual city of El Paso Texas where I live. This book was a bit of a disappointment. I did recognize some of the landmarks the author mentions however I disagree with the portrayal of those said landmarks. And a little boring too."
4,Bad Poetry Book,"Interesting book. I had expected the ""bad poetry"" to be culled from 20th century ""poets."" However, the ""bad poetry"" came from the old ""masters."""
5,Loved it!,"Wonderful book! Had a great storyline. Very interesting characters! Takes a closer look at the ""menace girls""!!! Loved it the girls are so funny!"
5,Wonderful and fun... Even as a reread!,I read this ages ago and remembered enjoying it... The second read was just as enjoyable and endearing! A great rainy day read!
4,The Bad Luck Wedding Cake,This was an easy read and grabbed my attention right from the first few pages and I was unable to put it down. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cute romantic story.
3,Just Okay,"The first book in this series was cute and quite charming, but I can't say the same for this one. It's not a bad book, and I think I would have liked it better if the first book wasn't as good. As it is, the characters and plot just seem to be recycled from the first. I do have to say that I enjoy that the heroine isn't just some flighty damsel in distress and that she has a plan and a vision for herself. Not a bad read over all."
4,"Enjoyable, light hearted read.",. The adults and children are very humorous causing some out loud giggles. Held my attention long enough to mess up my sleeping schedule for a couple of nights.
4,Quick read,"This was a quick, enjoyable read. I enjoy light romance books especially when on vacation and this fit the bill."
3,Okay,"Funny premise, settings interesting, some of the situations contrived, light and relatively fast paced, recommend as a fast quick read"
4,Enjoyable but no fire,"This concert is well documented & you can clearly see Otis playing his red Gibson semi-hollowbody. Although there is quite a lot of soloing & fine singing, Otis never really hits the intense levels I have heard from him in the past (listen to some of his primal screaming on the ""Cold Day in Hell"" album). In fact, he seems very mellow. As mentioned in other reviews, Clapton does have an unusually nasty guitar tone--so much so that it seems a little out of place. Luther Allison is by far the most energetic performer on the ticket.I like Otis Rush a lot. His singing & playing are very distinctive & equals the best in the blues genre. If you're already a fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this DVD. Its not a pick-me-up performance, however; if you want that, get John Hiatt's ""Live at Austin City Limits"" DVD. Its awesome."
3,"I Think ""Up Side Down"" should have been on the Real People album by Chic","I always felt that, the song ""Up Side Down"" by Diana Ross should have been a Chic release. When I first heard it, I thought right away it was either Chic or Sister Sledge, because in my opinion Sister Sledge was just an extention of Chic. But, I guess they had to promote the ""Diva"" Miss Ross for a new sound and the 80's decade, so the rest is history.The Real People album is alright, the only radio play from that album of coures (only single released) is ""Rebels Are We"" but I think the best track on that album (to me)is the instrumental ""Open Up."" I like the base and the guitar precussion break down of the song, I mean just a masterpiece!!! DAMN CHIC WAS BADD!!!!"
4,A Look At The Losers Of Plato,"This book is, by far, the single best-written book about the interlocutors of Socrates as they appear in Plato's dialogues. When studying Plato or Socrates it is important to understand something about the person whom Socrates is arguing with. These people were well known in Athens and well known by the Athenians Reading the Dialogues. Plato wrote to incorporate the personalities of the interlocutors, and it effects how Socrates forms the arguments within the dialogues, so understanding the interlocutors is crucial. This book seriously deals with the issue of who these people are and gives the reader a better understanding of ancient Athens, Plato, Socrates, and the interlocutors themselves"
4,A Perfect Complement,"A great album for Powell and Pressburger movie fans (which I am)! Much of the great music associated with the films. Would have liked to have heard more of certain movies such as ""Canterbury Tale"" and incidental music for ""Red Shoes"", however, the CD liner explains much and why some music just is not available. WARNING: some music is not remastered due to the problems noted in the liner but they do have a tendency to add to the charm of the CD!Excellent value for the money!JBF"
2,Rayovac D vs Duracell D: Duracells last longer,"Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday. The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer). In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10)."
1,Leaking Rayovac D cells,"Had two ""D"" cells out of a package of 6 which leaked. One damaged a Magalite flashlight which cost about $20. Have also used their AA alkaline cells, but had no problems. For the little difference, I plan to use Energizer or Duricell batteries in the future."
1,Rayovac makes false claims,"Rayovac vouches just as good as Duracell. I am very upset with purchase I recently bought. (not amazon, but Wally world)......... My Duracells last months, these Rayovacs didn't even last a week. Faulty, cheap, and misleading. Returning them and will never will buy Rayovac again!"
1,Leaked Battery Acid,We bought these batteries prior to switching primarily to rechargeables for our son's toys. We have gone through a lot of batteries and a lot of brands and gave these a try thinking they would have good price/value. Unfortunately we had 2 of these packs we bought that within a month started having battery acid oozing out of them. I would not recommend these due to our poor experience.
5,Batteries are A-ok,Life is good and the batteries work the way they are supposed to work. Good value.
1,returned product,I have returned this product because I did not receive the same filters that I ordered. The ones I received did not work in my humidifier and left lots of black debris all over the inside of the humidifier. I returned the package and paid the return postage. Please see that my account is credited.Thank youBarbara
1,Title is absurd.,"""Made in Texas""? What a joke. Bush isn't a Native Texan first of all. He didn't graduate high school here, didn't graduate college here, and was born of two Yankees. In fact, virtually all of his education was done in elitist institutions in the northeast. Just because you move to Texas and put on a cowboy hat doesn't make you a Texan!!"
5,Finally.,"""This aberrant president is one of the worst in American history.""At last someone dares to publish what so many Americans and the majority of the world know to be true. My only quibble with the book is why Lind feels the need to proclaim Bush merely *one* of the worst."
2,Too much history,Book provides more of an analysis of Bush's policy as the way it's influenced by Texas history. The book is more of Texas history in a synopsis then Bush's policies. I would have preferred a book on Bush's policy then a book on Texas' history.
1,Assasination by Insinuation,This book embodies all that is wrong with the mainstream media. Many liberals work from the assumption that all those who oppose their views must be morally flawed. Southerners must all be racist and perpetually plotting the destruction of America. The author should look in the mirror perhaps he has revelaed himself in his work of fiction rather than those he has targeted.
2,Nothing new!,"I purchased this book under the impression that it would offer new insights into the business that I have been in for the past 10 years. I agree that using stories, metaphors and analogies coupled with strong relationship skills, is the way to sell financial services in today's market. Having said that I wish this book would have offered more than a rehash of old marketing techniques. I found very little new information. I was also confused as to why there was such a strong emphasis on Warren Buffet. Overall it was not helpful to me but others might benefit from this simple text."
5,"For fundraisers, too","Fundraisers: Don't judge this book by its title. I'm a big fan of reading outside the bubble of the fundraising industry. Every so often your reward is you run across a shockingly helpful business book that seems at first glance to have nothing to do with fundraising -- and yet is profoundly helpful with that difficult enterprise. This is one of those titles: Storyselling for Financial Advisors.But you say, ""I'm not a financial advisor."" And I say, ""Are you so sure, Ms. and Mr. Fundraiser?"" You ask strangers to trust you with their hard-earned money, right? Well, this sage book will explain how to do that task far more effectively, especially with mid-sized to major donors, using proven techniques developed by top-selling financial advisors. Among the book's key points: put away your charts and graphs and learn to speak intelligently to the right side of the prospect's brain, the place where the emotions reside."
2,Nothing new here,this book has nothing new. It is just a compilation of other books and studies. If you are currently a financial advisor the information in this book should already be known. If you are new to the business you should find a great benefit. As I read the book I kept thinking I had read it before word by word. I am certain I did not.
4,Storyselling for Financial Advisors : How Top Producers Sell,Good techniques that could be applied immediately by those involved in an financial-investments advisory capacity.
1,Big Disappointment,"This might be o.k. for a rookie advisor with no prior experience, maybe right out of college. I really got no value out of this book."
5,Financial Advisor's Hand Book.,This book draws your attention to the least focused aspect of financial advisory practice which inturn make up a significant difference in the advisor's overall success. It is a must have for all advisors. I believe in retrospect it is the 80/20 rule book for financial advisors.
3,"Nothing new, but a few good ideas",This book offered a few good ideas but I found the financial planning metaphors to be SEVERELY outdated. A 2010 edition would be nice to see. It's a quick read and does offer some insight into how clients/prospects see issues that advisors don't realize are hard to conceptualize.
1,Don't waste time,"I've been using the same style for 8 years and I have to reorder 1-2 times a year. Each time I re-order It's a crap chute if I can find what I want. This is not the same as the Doc Johnson Slim G they changed the model and this did not cut it. I reorded 2 othes the night I got this. Used once and tossed it, not worth wasting my batteries."
2,not satisfied,I give this toy a two because its not as powerful as we thought it would be. the colt bullet has more power my girlfriend was not satisfied with this toy
1,Not recommended,I purchased one of these and it did not work. I was able to get it replaced at no cost but the new one works only if I hit it with my hand. I would not purchase this product again.
1,IT DOESN'T WORK!!!,I just received my new Slimline G Vibe in Purple and guess what. It doesn't work. First i put in rechargeable batteries. I knew for some of my toys the batteries were too strong. so i bought a new pack of double A batteries and tried again. Nothing. Put in old dollar batteries. Nothing. Mix Matched. NOTHING. I am VERY disappointed. ONE STAR!
3,not enough power,"i tried this product it's feel so good and i had so much fun. It's 8"" long when you go deep feels somuch better butnot enough power and noisey but right shape and size"
3,Too hard for our taste.,I'm not really disappointed with this product but my wife didn't like how hard it was. Even though I saw that the product was hard plastic I figured I would order it and give it a shot. She was not impressed with it but I'm sure others would enjoy it more than she. Even still I gave it three stars from our experience from it and it's ok and very powerful too.
5,Favorite Sex Toy,"I've had this vibrator for over a year now and so far it has been one of my favorites. Whether I'm taking time ""for myself"" or with my husband I never fail at having an orgasm. In fact it has been the main toy that stimulates my g spot. The biggest reason why I think that I have success with this vibrator is that it hits the g spot perfectly. Put it this way with this vibrator it helped me to ""squirt"" all over the place and my husband loved every second of it! :)"
3,Still not a very long battery life...,"We bought this to replace the rechargeable battery that came with our digital camera. This battery is better, but the life is still not as long as the digital readout would have you believe. So far, I'm not very impressed with Sony's rechargeable camera batteries."
3,Sony NP-BG1 Type G Lithium Ion Battery,This product was somewhat disappointing. I did not get the time I expected from the battery. I have two of the same batteries now and often cannot get through one day without going through the charge of both of them. They take 5 hours to recharge making them very inconvenient.
4,Service is great,"Looked high and low for this battery . No place in my home town had it. Came to Amazon there is was . great price , ordered it and was here in 2 days . You rock Amazon . thanks"
3,Sony digital camera battery,I bought this Sony NP-BG1 Type G Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery as a backup to my Sony Cyber Shot digital camera's battery. I normally have it charged up and ready to go in case I get a little clicking crazy with the camera. It doesn't seem to really last all that long so I bring my charger with me also. But for the price you can't really complain.
2,What IS it compatible with?,"I bought this battery so that I would have three batteries for my camera for a wedding I was shooting at. I charged it up, and as far as I know it charged fine. But when I put it into my camera the night before the wedding to check it, it stated that it wasn't compatible with my camera. I use a Sony-Cybershot, one that uses batteries of the same type. I'm not sure what went wrong, but because of this I am unable to use it at all."
5,Battery for my camera was a great order!,This battery has been a great purchase for me. Now I don't have to stop taking photos just because my one-only battery has died. The service on the shipping of the product was awesome.
1,Not Compatible,"Bought these for an upcoming work trip, I charged them and put them in my camera and received a ""use with compatible batteries"" message on my camera. They look the same as my original batteries and the labels are identical, so not sure why it does not work."
1,Misleading!!,"""Fits SON.NP-BG1"" is not authentic Sony brand. The photo is misleading and different from the product I received in the mail. The battery is SON.NP-BG1 instead of SONY. It is not ""by Sony"" like it stated in the description. The vendor is not honest about both the description of the product and the photogragh. ""The seller has clearly misrepresented the condition or details of an item in a way that affects its value or utility, it is ""materially different."" I requested a full refund. I am glad that I bought this on Amazon or I would not be able to get my money back."
5,Sony NP-BG1 Type G InfoLithium Rechargeable Battery Pack DSC-N1 Digital Camera,"Had it for over a year. Lasts really long. I use it with sony dsc-w100. I have a spare which I never(!) had to use. I mean one battery lasted always more than what I needed for one day of shooting/filming.EDIT_1: If used for taking many pictures with long exposure, at night for example, than it would drain a lot faster. But... I think that is due to the camera mechanism..."
2,It's not really a Sony,"I ordered a Sony battery...and got something labeled CTA DB-BG1. It works in my camera, but it's not a Sony as advertised."
3,Made in China,"The original battery provided with the camera is made in Japan. This one is made in China. Also it has an inscription:""for EU only"". Hoping that it will work OK..."
2,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH T200!!!!!!!!,"Even though this is listed in the links to the T200, this battery is NOT compatible. IF you have a T 200, you need the NPFD1, $15 more.Sony NPFD1 Rechargeable Battery PackNever used it so unable to comment on performance. Will write followup as to how amazon responds."
4,Battery,"Suppose to be good. It charged in the indicated time by the manufacturer. It's operating OK in the camera, so far so good. Think is a pretty good product."
1,Junk or may be defect,It was my great disappointment.This battery runs out before I take less than 80 pictures.The generic replacement battery I bought together runs over 500 pictures.
4,Mostly okay!,"The battery that came wasn't the exact one that I ordered, but it still worked out fine."
2,Sony Battery,"I ordered a Sony Type G Lithium Ion for my Sony camera. But, when I received it, it was a generic brand. No explaination why they sent it instead of the Sony. I had to e-mail them back and they gave me credit of $10.00. I wasn't very pleased the way they do business."
4,Its a battery...,"Not much to say about this... It's a fantastic battery?As far as I'm concerned, a battery either works or doesn't, and this one happens to work. My only gripe is how long the battery lasts, but I can't say I didn't know that before I ordered it.Get it if you have one of the supported Sony Cameras, its required for you to turn it on..."
4,"Great product, but why proprietary???","As with most Sony products, this battery is very reliable, long-lasting and obviously of high quality.The only real ""stick-point"" is that it is proprietary that is unique to only Sony products and then only a very few (perhaps only ONE!) models. That drives the cost of the battery way up relative to other batteries.I recognize that the Lithium Ion technology is more expensive to begin with, but it would seem quite obvious to me that Sony could come up with a more universal battery for use with more of their product lines thereby reducing costs tremendously.There are aftermarket versions of this battery (e.g., Everyready), sometimes for much less money. But I have not tried them yet only because the one merchant I found on Amazon had such a good, low price relative to all others I found.Again, excellent product!"
1,Fits snug,Purchased this as a back up for a trip to Disneyland. I was sure to purchase the brand name and not some knock-off because I wanted to be sure it would work. The battery got stuck inside the slot. I had to carefully remove the battery from my NEW camera with tweezers! Good thing we were back at the hotel when I discovered this. Too late to return after our return from our trip :/
1,Battery damaged,This battery arrived damaged from the shipper. No resolution with them as I had waited too long to file a complaint. Packaging was undamaged but battery had scratches and dings on it. It will not fit into my camera. My bad as I did not try it until Christmas season when I needed it. Had plugged it in to charge it prior to that. Not a good seller to order from.
5,Dependable camera power,"This battery is an exact replacement for the original, a dependable battery which always performed as expected. I wouldn't depend on unknown replacements."
5,Great value for money,"I have purchased this battery (Sony NP-BG1 Type G Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery) for my Sony camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290). The seller (VORTEX CABLE) send the item as promised within 4 days. I had paid $28.96 for the battery and the expedited shipping method.This battery worked great for my family vacation to LA, Las Vegas and Grand Canyon. I used it as spare battery and took numerous photos. I did saw one person exclaiming that his camera battery ran out while in Grand Canyon. By paying a small sum compared to the trip cost, I saved myself from that situation."
3,A little bit disapointed,I bought this one because sometimes I need to tape my son's basketball games and one battery is not enough. So I bought a new one to be sure i'd not have problems with batteries during the games. For my surprise this new one is during less than the first one.
4,Same as the one that came with the camera.,"Great product, exactly the same that came with my camera. now I can take the double number of photos. You should buy it."
5,Convenient and worth it!,It's good to serve as the 2nd battery of my camera. I have no worry of running out of battery during my trip anymore!
3,what is overall life expectancy?,My battery stopped taking a charge after a little more than a year. For this money I'd expect a battery to last longer than that! Is my experience unusual??
5,Sony NP-BG1,"The Sony NP-BG1 battery is the original battery that came with my camera, a Sony DSC-W30. So the battery is original, but the price was good. I bought two batteries for about $78.xx dollars with free shipping, or less than $40.00 each. At that time Sony was selling the same battery for about $64.00 plus shipping."
5,BZ on shipment and quality of item sent,It's great to see when you order something online that you can receive it on time in the condition which you expect it to be when you order it.Great job on the shipment and quality of the item sent to me.SincerelyTony Carbone
3,Capable but not remarkable,"My wife loves her camera that uses this battery, but I have noticed she needs to change batteries often, even when the camera has just been sitting in her bag..."
5,Go Sony G,"Bought for my Sony Cybershot DSC-W170, 10.1 meg. Had a B-Day party that lasted late into night. I took at least 50 flash pictures and battery held up with no problem. Only one or two seconds at most for flash to reset for next picture. Well worth the money."
4,Works fine,Seems to be working fine. Hopefully it die quickly like the original battery did. I think Sony batteries just die early in general. My vaio battery also died after 2 years.
5,Extra Battery,Nice to know that I have a backup battery to use - especially when I'm traveling and wanting to get those MEMORABLE shots.
1,Wrong Reccomendation,This battery was recommended for my DSC-T300 and it turned out to be the wrong battery.
1,battery for Sony Camera,"Great price, very good product. Service was fast and efficient. I recommend using this source for anyone else needing spare battery."
1,I won't be shopping at Amazon again,"I sent this product back since, although I paid for 2-3 day expedited service, it took 6 days to arrive. Your web page is unclear as to when a product should arrive. I thought 2-3 days meant I would receive it in :2-3 days"". Not so according to your company. I think that was misleading and I don't intend to order from you again.Jean Aldridge"
1,"Is This Really A ""Info Lithium"" Battery?",It isn't marked with the words Info Lithium so I am confused about whether this battery has that feedback feature or not.
1,Crappp!!!,Sony has this new think in there batteries where they dont let other batties work on your camera so you dont swap batties around from all your cameras with one battery. Thsi battery will probably say that it is not compatible with your camera even though it says it is.
1,out of stock,I did not receive this merchandise because the vendor ran out of stock and i was refunded the credit. Therefore I have no review on this product.
1,Will not hold a charge.,This battery will not hold a charge for even 10 shots. I charged it overnight and it went dead after only 10 shots.
1,Ripped off!,"Looks like this product may have been a knock off with a sony label as all of the markings are identical, but when inserted in the camera it says for ""use with compatible battery only"". Very disappointed, all of my previous amazon purchases have been excellent until now."
1,Defective,"This item was dead on arrival and will not charge, when plugged in the charger it immediatly shows a bad battery and will not charge."
4,THe battery for camara,"These battery my camara use, before the camar is deht I'm nott use but now my camara workso good"
5,great price,A requirement for my camera; so when I saw the price . . . I couldn't pass it up. Fast ship!!
3,early j. chan,"It's almost funny. Jackie Chan in the late 1970's, early '80s. No stunts that mark his later career, this all about straight fighting at slow pace, one in which you notice the plotting and plans. The villian here almost seems to outshine Chan in terms of fighting and martial arts. Still, you see Chan's Buster Keaton-like humor develop here. It doesn't matter how bad the dubbing is, as Chan's physical mannerisms are still a joy to watch, even if it's no where near the calibre of Drunken Master 2 or Mr. Nice Guy. If you buy this, you get a little bit of martial art's history. . .namely, seeing one of Jackie Chan's low-budget steps towards becoming a screen hero.Granted, some of this [is not so good], but it is fun to watch a master in the early stages of his career."
1,nothing right with this product,"Of the 30 or so items I have purchased from Amazon this year, without any doubt, this is the worst. It struggled to connect to my bluetooth, struggled to stay connected, and even when it was connected the sensetivity was so poor that the mouse was virtually unusable. Any fine pointing tasks are incredibly frustrating as the mouse does not seem to track well on any surface.The presenter buttons on the bottom are impossible to push without also pushing one of the click buttons on the top of the mouse. It is too small for comfortable use for anything but a couple of minutes. The battery life was consistently less than a week.The only good news I have about this purchase is that after 6 months it has completely stopped working and I can be done with dealing with it and get on to purchasing something else."
1,Bluetooth disaster,"Promised feature - troubles operation with the USB receiver. Experience - only problems. Hardware - Lenovo X61, Windows XP Professional with all updates installed. First attempts to pair with the receiver - a lot of ""pressing the button for 5 seconds"". Then after successful pairing worked normally until the computer was turned off. Then after I have turned it on, the sad pairing process repeated. At the third turning on of computer, I have struggled with pairing device for about 10 minutes and I have dropped the attempts. If I shall not be able to do it on the forth turn on of computer, I shall quit and return the product."
4,Nice product overall,"Overall this is a nice product, no regrets on the purchase. It's very responsive and the most accurate on almost any surface without a mousepad. It's a little small, but not too bad. I like the integrated laser pointer and the ability to control presentations. However, in order to use the presentation controls, you need to have their software installed, and this causes your screen to flicker every so often. This is well documented on various websites as being caused by the ipoint software. I figured out how to install/uninstall it on the fly so if I need the presentation ""stuff"" it is available but I can turn it off for all the other times and avoid the flickering. Battery life isn't all that great, a couple weeks on a pair of AAA's. I'm trying out rechargeables to see how they work. Overall I would recommend this, I got a great deal on Amazon, around 50% off list at the time I purchased it."
1,Not compatible with my Mac,"I managed to get the mouse to work with my bluetooth enabled MacBook Pro (OS X 10.6.8) using info on the web (not supplied with the mouse), but the performance was poor. I loaded the supplied Intellipoint software (Mac version) but this crashed my computer and exhausted the batteries in 24 hours. I can use it after unloading the supplied software but the extra features (incl presenter functions but excl the laser) do not work."
3,installation problem,"I had to download version 7.1 to install the microsoft notebook presenter mouse 8000 on Windows 7, 64 bit. The connection wizard couldn't recognize the mouse. After spending nearly an hour reading through reviews and help option in intellipoint 7, i ended up calling the customer service. The default mouse recognition is by software mode, customer support associate changed it to hardware managed recognition and then I was able to connect the mouse. It seems to work good so far and hope it stays that way."
5,Wonderful wireless mouse,"I bought it for all the bells and whistles that I might need. But I only currently use it as a basic mouse. It appears to be more responsive than my old wired mouse. When I get around to testing all the other features, I'll come back and edit my review. I keep forgetting to turn it off when not in use, but the battery life keeps on ticking."
5,Great service,This mouse is a very handy presentation tool. I've used one for about a year and the unit works for many hours with just 2 AAA batteries. I've bought several for family and customers and have never had a problem with one; until now. The one I received from this vendor was missing the battery compartment cover and had to be RMA'd. The vendor was a bit surprised as was I that it was missing a part but it happened. They refunded the purchase price and shipping within a week since they did not have a replacement mouse in stock.
4,Good device,"I should say that I bought this to use with my Asus netbook. It comes with a clear hardshell case that is great for protecting the mouse. However, the packaging was very confusing and I almost cut the case to extract the mouse.Installing the bluetooth feature was relatively easy but I wish the directions had been clearer. I had to fumble around a good bit with several features.I haven't tried the presentation features.The mouse is comfortable and once installed, it comes on easily.Windows XP recognized it at once when the software was installed.It's a little small for my hands but I prefer it to the touchpad if you are working for a long time.A nice device at a nice price."
5,Excellent!,"I have only praise for this mouse! but beware .... Do not drop, because it can damage it beyond repair and there.For whom is a teacher and uses Power Point presentations. As I teach and use many PowerPoint presentations, can not sit without using it. Very good run since they use it very carefully.A.V.B."
3,"Cool Laser pointer, bad interference.","They say that this mouse is supposed to automatically change wireless frequencies when reception lowers. But it doesn't. There is also a problem with the driver. When plugging in the USB receiver into the computer the software takes 5 minutes to ""setup and connect mouse"". This is unacceptable. It then sets up ""again"" the bluetooth drivers so that other bluetooth devices can connect. It doesn't need to do this every time you plug in the receiver. So ultimately the programming was done poorly, but what more can we expect from Microsoft?"
3,Picky About Surfaces,"I've had other laser mice and I have to say this one is the pickiest of them all about the surface you put it on. Other mice seem to work fine on surfaces like tables and couches, but I've only been able to get this one to work well on a mouse pad, and actually not had it work very well on another mouse pad. Also, I am using this on a Macbook Pro and even when I turn up my pointer speed it still seems a little sluggish."
2,Worked for a couple of months and now drops the connection,"This mouse worked well for about a month. Then the magnify button stuck, so I had to disable it. Now the mouse randomly drops the connection. I have to reconnect several times a day, especially when the computer goes into standby or hibernate. Also, the batteries only last for about a week.On the plus side, the mouse is very comfortable. Also, the laser is fun to tease my dog with. Probably works well with cats too."
5,A great product by Microsoft,I had been looking for a dual purpose mice that could serve as a presenter too. This product is amazing. I earlier bought a presenter for $50 from Staples and it didn't work well as presenter. This one is much less in price and works smoothly. I have had no problems with it so far.A great buy and a must have for grad students who do conference presentations.
2,Works Awfully Bad with OS X,"Setup is a breeze, but when moving the mouse back and forth, it will skip and jump ahead, which can be VERY frustrating for precision type stuff (my batteries are 100% full at this point). I thought this was because I did not have the MS drivers. I downloaded them, installed it and now none of the other buttons are customizable.There is no uninstaller so who know what files are wreaking havoc on my machine's drivers.I usually buy Logitech mice, dunno why I gave this a try but I sure am regretting it now :S"
4,Great Mouse but a bit overpriced,"This mouse is amazing once getting used to. There are many features that you can customize your mouse to do. Such as: digital ink and a magnifier. However, the gettign used to part is the clicking and scrolling on the mouse. It's not like most logitec mice i've used. this one has a soft click and very sensitive scrolling. Even though you can adjest the settings, it's still is quite sensistive causing your document to skip multiple pages or dramatically zooming in or out when holding down teh cntrl key and scrolling. But besides that, the presentation features have been very useful to me. Especially the digital ink. Also, since the mouse comes with a bluetooth adapter, you can also sync in pictures from your phone and stuff."
1,Worthless without supplied dongle,"This mouse is advertised as ""bluetooth"" but must use the supplied Microsoft dongle to function. Useless with any built in bluetooth receiver, which is the entire point of having a bluetooth capable computer!!!"
5,Pros outweigh the cons,"Pros:- Top quality- Long battery life- comes with MS bluetooth dongle but works with widdcom too- Usable size/weight even though small and compact- Laser tracking is absolutely awesome- Presentation features make it a must for business usersCons:- Wheel has right and left tilts but they are not programmable so you're stuck with horizontal scrolling.- Right and left side-buttons are not comfortable to use on such a small size.- The wheel feels like it misses out on something because of its smooth-rolling (no clicks as you turn it). You'll need those clicks at times, believe me.Summary: I couldn't find a better tracking bluetooth mouse. And I don't want a wireless dongle unnecessarily when I have bluetooth built into my laptop. Forget optical mice, laser rules."
1,"Presenter is not ""plug in and play""","I want a good presenter and a regular mouse. I chose Microsoft because I thought it would support its own product. But surprisingly, it can't. I have to install a software to make it fully functional for presenter.If you just go to someplace to do a presentation, do you think you are allowed to install a software to other peoples' computer?As a mouse it is good, but as a presenter it is terrible. It also seems that if your laptop has a Bluetooth device already, the mouse's Bluethooth will interfere with it."
4,Fantastic mouse -- but no Mac support!,"This is a fantastic little mouse -- but unlike every other Microsoft mouse/keyboard out there, there is *NO* Macintosh support. This is quite bewildering and a bit surprising. There are hacks available to get the basic 4-button tilt/scroll mouse support working through the internal MacOS bluetooth driver (just google for ""Microsoft Presenter Notebook 8000 Mac driver"" or visit MacRumors) but no one has figured out how to support the presenter controls on the underside of the mouse -- the very reason for getting this model.I'm happy nonetheless. I'm sure someone will eventually figure it out and this mouse is a stellar mouse for just regular mousing. You'll need to load a third party driver (like SteerMouse) to slow down the mouse sensitivity since the default / native driver is a bit too jerky."
2,I hate it,"Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000. I hate it.My major application software are ProEngineer & SolidWorks, which use Middle Button a lot and require smooth / precision cursor.1. The middle button of this mouse is hard, require FORCE, require control so it can be pressed down vertically or it will tilt sideway due to excessive force apply.2. The cursor is JUMPING. It jumps too often, seem like sleep and wake up every second. Imagin I am writing this review, I have to check the star (1 to 5 stars), I am having difficulty to place the cursor on the little star to check mark it.The reason I buy this mouse because I don't like any dongles. Turn out not equivalent trade off."
5,Wireless Mouse,Easy to use and set up. Amazon provided an excellent value for this same item costing twice as much from other dealers.
4,Great bluetooth mouse,"One of the best bluetooth mouse in the market, I have used with a ThinkPad T60, ThinkPad X61 and a Macbook Pro without trouble.As some other reviwers have point out the documentation is the worst of these product."
5,MS Presenter Notebook Mouse ++++!,"Great little mouse that doubles as a remote presenter, complete with volume, fwd/rev and laser pointer. Great one do-it-all device. I recommend..."
1,Pathetic mouse!,"I bought this mouse with much fanfare and after using it for a week, following are my observations:1. Everytime I require to connect, I need to keep this mouse and transreceiver in search mode by pressing small buttons on both devices and then run the software to search and make them connect.2. I wanted to use this mouse across three different systems (2 laptops and 1 desktop) without much hassle -- NOW it looks like I am better off having three mouse at home rather than using this bluetooth mouse.3. The worst part comes with the scroller -- its lousy and it does not even respond at all. Tried all scroll setting in vein. (mouse pointer works ok though!)4. To summarizse, please do not buy this mouse and you'll be better off using $10 wired mouse.Cheers..Mahi"
1,Does no live up to it's potential promise!,It seemed to work for a while then after it was too late to return it to the store it would change slides automatically in presenter mode and/or cause the cursor to jump around in mouse mode.I'll see if Microsoft will send me a new one but I doubt it.
2,Pointer moves like it's drunk,Bought three of these for executives in my company. They use them to give presentaions on large screens in their offices and on the road. After some initial difficulty getting them to connect the mouse works. Unfortunatly the cursor is not very responsive regardless of any changes in the settings. It drifts around the screen and is hard to control. Two out of three executives gave them back to me and asked me to find another presentor mouse for them.
4,Nice Mouse,Saves me buying two devices and is pretty much plug and play. Battery last much longer than earlier generations of blue tooth mice. This is the second one I have purchased.
2,"Definitely Not a ""Presenter"" Mouse","For general use, generously a three-star mouse; for presentations, a one-star mouse. Presenter/Media Mode buttons are a great advent, and the laser pointer is great for your presentations or pets. However, this is a Bluetooth mouse and suffers from the lag issues associated with all Bluetooth mice. It took me two or three attempts to pair the mouse with the Bluetooth receiver such that it is usually acceptably responsive, and I still don't go a day without both laggy periods and outright nonresponsive periods lasting from five to thirty seconds or more. For poking around the Internet and Microsoft Office, this mouse hasn't been bad enough to warrant another replacement -- yet -- but I would never risk half a minute waiting for the mouse in the middle of a presentation."
3,good for price,"This mouse works as promised but I wish it had a better range for the presenter mode. Battery life is very good, and once the software is installed everything works great."
2,Gotta have that solid click - and this mouse doesnt.,"My issue with this mouse is that it is not easy to click the buttons. One has to push a little harder than normal and in doing so, it's likely that the pointer will move in the process. What's more, once the buttons are pushed fully, you don't get that gratifying ""click"" sound. It's much more subdued...I'm sure that I would eventually get used to it if I gave it a chance, but I don't have the patience to re-train my hand on how to use a mouse. I threw the product in the garbage and would not recommend purchasing."
3,"Good mouse, but awkward to click","My ONLY complaint about this mouse is that, for some reason, it's awkward to click. It feels good in my hand, it feels substantial and high-quality. The sensitivity is great, and it was a snap to pair the bluetooth with my laptop. I found that I really like the smooth-scrolling wheel - now I wish my other mice were smooth-scrolling. But I REALLY have to concentrate to click either of the main buttons or the wheel button without moving the mouse. There's something about the shape, or maybe it's just too easy to move; but it just wants to move backward when I press down on the buttons. The strain of holding the mouse in place when I click makes my wrist tired after long sessions. I was hoping I'd just get used to it, but I've had it for two months now and it's still a noticable issue. Sad, because I really love everything else about it."
5,Mighty Mouse!,"We ditched cable and use our computer to watch TV now. So... the TV is about 10 feet away from our couches. This mouse is PERFECT for us. It works all the way across the room (this is with our computer inside a credenza). You push a button, flip over the mouse and you have volume, play pause. Great idea, as finding the little speaker icon is a pain in the booty from 10 feet away.OH AND it has a laser pointer, so even our cat enjoys this mouse. We call ours Mighty Mouse. It is awesome. If you are looking for a mouse with long range and tons of cool features this is the one. It has a bunch of buttons you can customize. We made the two side buttons zoom-in and zoom-out so you can blow up pages with small font (another great thing to be able to do if you are across the room from your TV).I guess it would be cool for PowerPoint and stuff too, but I don't mess around with any of that nonsense."
1,Just not worth the money.,"I was thrilled when I first got this mouse and then my enthusiasm waned quickly. My major complaint was how fast it goes through batteries. I have spent more in AAA batteries in the past three months than I did on the mouse. My second problem is that it seems to switch modes if left unattended for a few moments. I will get up from my computer and when I get back - even less than a minute later, it is on Presentation Mode or Magnify Mode. It also was not a smooth mouse and it was difficult to do tasks that needed to be very accurate, like photo modification or graphics.The laser pointer was cool, though.I just would not recommend this product unless you have very light mouse use and want it almost entirely as a secondary mouse for presentations."
4,Nice!,"It is a nice mouse come up by MS. However, there are a few things that i need to discuss with any prospective buyer. I think it is a bit over priced for the features it offers. i mean, had it been priced around $40 / $50, then it would have really been value for money. Secondly, i think it should have had more buttons so that you could have more functions from it as offered in its list. Rest, i would say it is a good device, integrates nice with the computer and works fine with windows XP. No complaints. The presenter is great, the media remote is nice as well (synchronizes well with windows media player, but not with any other; the vol. control works anyway.)"
4,A Presenter's Best Friend,"As for the Presenter part, since I no longer have to stand beside the Notebook to advance the PowerPoint slides, my presentation style has become more fluid and natural.As far as using it as a Mouse, it is small, even for my small hands. If it were a standard size, I would have given it the 5th star.As part of the industrial-strength ""retail packaging"", there is a clear plastic carrying case for the Mouse and the Bluetooth Dongle to protect them when you are traveling. A nice touch."
2,presenter mouse,"I bought one of these and the battery door latch broke the first time I had to open it to replace the batteries. I taped it shut, but there isn't a way to really keep the batteries in for any period of time. Basically it was a waste of money. I'm out shopping for a new one. :)"
3,plug and play was so much better!,"As with most everything that tries to do two things well, this wireless presenter mouse also is weak in one area or the other. It functions well enough as a mouse, however I and others who are forced to use it (as Plug and play is being abandoned)feel that it is difficult not to press a wrong button durring presentation, it is awkward and expensive. However if you are one of the thousands who are currently paying to beta test Vista, you wil be forced to abandon your 15.00 plug and play for a 100+ blue tooth. Faced with that, this is currently your best if not only option."
2,Slower version of traditional songs.,"Bought this for my parents. I thought they would like it but I was told the traditional songs were sung in typical E.A. style, slowww."
5,Quality product!,This is a great curtain. It's listed as a liner but I use it as the shower curtain itself. It's heavier than most and not stiff so it hangs really well. The ring holes have metal gromets so it will last without the holes tearing. This curtain also resists the cloudy water-deposit film that ruins most curtains. A great quality product!
5,Croscill Shower Curtain Liner,"This shower curtain was perfect for letting in light, but giving a sense of privacy. It is the perfect shower curtain for a bathroom that has minimal light. Please keep this in stock. I had a difficult time finding what I wanted in stores. It is the perfect shower curtain liner."
2,"Decent looking, but mildews easily","I purchased this shower liner about three months ago to replace a liner which lasted me a year and a half. Upon receipt, I was pleased. The liner was made of slightly heavier material than the one I had previously and was translucent, but not transparent.Fast forward three months to today and I am already beginning to see mildew on the liner. In comparison to the previous liner I owned, this liner appears to be aging about four times faster. Not good.In short, get this liner if you like the way it looks, but don't actually plan on using it. Otherwise, find one with better mildew resistance."
2,Disappointment!!,I purchased the Croscill shower curtain liner. While I was hanging the curtain I noticed the rings on the liner were not large enough to fit through my shower curtain clips!! The company should supply clips that fit this curtain; also there were not leaded weights on the bottom of the liner. I think I'll stick with the vinyl-never a problem.
4,Good Stuff,I was very pleased to find this book on CD as the tape versions keep jamming. Thanks for the prompt delivery of this book.
2,snoozefest,"I was disappointed in this book. The plot develops very slowly, with very little action involving the person Mrs Pollifax is sent to Hong Kong to see. You have to wait until the last 20 pages until you see this ""mystery"" is about some terrorists, who for the cause of Chiang Kai-Shek want to take over Hong Kong. Weak weak weak, and sad.It cracks me up how Mrs Pollifax and other Americans act more British than American in this series."
3,Mrs. Pollifax meets old friends,"The newly-married Mrs. Pollifax is in the process of fixing up her new home in the country when Bishop appears on her doorstep and offers her another assignment for the CIA. Cyrus is out of town and Mrs. P. must give an immediate answer, so an hour later she is on her way to Hong Kong. Her mission is to contact Sheng Ti, whom she met in an earlier book and find out what is going on at Feng Imports where Sheng Ti is working for an agent named Detwiler. Detwiler's reports to the CIA have proved to be false, so he is suspected of being a counterspy and giving evidence to the enemy. Mrs. Pollifax meets some other interesting characters, including a psychic, and another old friend who is a reformed cat burglar while in pursuit of the truth about Feng Imports. She is captured and suffers from some unnecessarily harsh treatment, probably the reason this is not most people's favorite book of the series."
3,Hardest to Read,"I found this to be the hardest of the Mrs. Polifax novels to read and strangely enough, the least believable.She is now married, but ends up on this adventure alone. I could never understand why she made the stupid mistakes that she did, nor why she had to be tortured.Whole well written, it seems the opposite of the first novel. There, she was in despair and her adventure gave her a new reason for living. Here, she is enjoying life, and her adventure brings darkness into her life. While it may be a natural growth out of the series, there is a darker side to this novel that makes it less fun."
4,Premium Ignition Cables,I researched these cables and based on the reviews ordered a set for my 90 Honda Accord. I wanted OEM quality and these fit the bill exactly. Definite improvement.
5,Adorable!,These are just perfect. I bought them on sale for my sister in law that is a nurse and I know she is going to love them.
5,"Not ""fight or flight"" but FLOW!","Thomas Crum uses his martial arts expertise to offer helpful insights about those situations in which you find yourself in conflict with another person and feel like fighting or running away. He says: ""Flow!"" In other words remain centered, redirect their energy: deflect, step aside, don't respond in kind, don't try to block. This is a basic concept of Aikido and the ""Aiki Way"" which he has derived from it. You don't have to be a martial artist to gain from this book. By acknowledging the visceral connection we associate with conflict he gets you much further than many books based strictly on communication theory."
5,A must read book!,The magic of conflict is probably one of the best books I have read so far. The information is great and a great tool to understand conflict and how to manage it. This is a must read book!!
4,Everyone We Meet Helps Us Learn Something,Almost every situation we're in makes us see ourselves in the mirror. Think conflict is a bad thing? Maybe yes and maybe no. If we remain open we can learn something from our interactions. Thank goodness for challenges. They help us learn and grow.
3,"No nepotism, please","This album isn't all THAT great, and I'm not saying that just because I once caught a glimpse of the second cousin of someone who once painted the house of a band member's dog's veterinarian's proctologist.It's got some strong, catchy riffs here and there, but overall I sense no ""spark"" to really lift this out of mediocrity. There is nothing that really grabs you enough to make you want to listen to it repeatedly. The musicians are adequate, though not amazing, but the singer--if you want to call him that--needs to stop gargling glass."
1,junky,"Well, you get what you pay for and these were really cheap. The cord weighs more than the candle so it continuously falls off the window sill. I know better for next time...don't be cheap! :o)"
3,Two out of three failed after one day of use (not exactly failed),"I purchased three of these candle lamps, and after only one day, two of them stopped working. I verified the power outlet and bulb to be good. Will be returning all three.Aside from them not working, they are extremely light and have a cheap feeling to them.[EDIT] I bumped up my rating from 1 to 3 stars - I figured out that the lights work, but something prevents them from being able to be unplugged and plugged in again immediately to reset the internal timer. It appears that, if you want to reset the timer, you must unplug them and leave them out for some amount of time (I waited until the next day). Now all three run on the 8 on / 16 off schedule, so they do technically work, but you can't change the timer at any time like it would have you believe."
4,bien,las he probado con un detector de metales en la cual usa dos baterias y si funcionan bien. y si duran un buen tiempo.
5,9 V BATTERIES,Happy to finally have an abundance of this size battery and in a little plastic case thingy for storage. Nice feature. I can't run out now which has always been the case. It's the little things in life that please. Price was good.
1,Two out of the first three batteries were dead!,"These 9 volt batteries are a total rip-off! The first one I used lasted only two weeks in a smoke detector, and the next two I tried were dead."
5,Price and Performance A1!,Purchased this for my laptop after reading a few reviews. You can't beat the price - performance is excellent for my needs. Also - shipping was super fast!
2,very short life,"Well I bought this charger because the cable of my old one started breaking after several years of service. At first I was really happy, It fit better then the old one and had a light to let me make sure it was plugged in. After a couple of weeks the brick started making a weird buzzing noise and a little while latter the charge would come and go (the light would fade then brighten. Pretty soon it became incredibly difficult to charge and finally it has completely stoped working. It has been little more then a month since my purchase and I recomend you buy a different brand like I am about to do.Good luck"
3,The power adapter I love to hate,"I hate the pin connector on this adapter. It is Toshibas fault though. It is really terrible. I can never find a replacement adapter to fit without constantly falling out. If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy this laptop. As far as the power adapter is concerned, it powers my laptop just fine and charges the battery, as long as I can keep the pin connector in it's hole."
4,Excellent replacement,"After the original power brick for my laptop died, I looked all around to find a replacement. The one Toshiba was expensive and in checking out the reviews for it, it seems very prone to failure. In reading the comments I was lucky mine lasted as long as it did! After reading through many offerings I decided on this one based on reviews. I was not disappointed. It shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. It works great!The only problem I have with it is that the plug is a little loose in the laptop. It is very close, but just loose enough to fall out if the computer is moved around. It was solved easily by putting a piece of electrical tape along one side the plug. That gave it a snug fit, and it has not fallen out since then."
4,"Great Product, one issue","This is a great product. It works better for us than the latex alternatives, as my partner has a latex allergy. I like to use it on hotel balconies to dry wet bathing suits because it keeps the clothes off the railing and also clips to them so they can't blow away.The only problem I have is attaching the line to the hotel. First, there must be something to hook it to on both ends...this can be a problem in some hotel showers. Second, the hooks are not fixed in place so if you cannot hang it in a straight line (and I seldom find a balcony or shower where I can hang it straight), the hooks all fall together and so do your clothes. It would be beneficial if every three hooks were fixed in place."
4,I disagree!,"I most definitely disagree! While this album has more of an ""artsy"" feel to it, it is in no way inferior! Yes, Whiteheart has departed from the traditional ""rock"" sound, but what they've created is a great sound that is 100% Whiteheart. If you have an open mind and varied musical tastes, BUY THIS ALBUM."
2,Disappointing close to the career of a great band,"Frankly, I was rather disappointed with ""Redemption"". I've been a Whiteheart fan for about ten years and I thought that the edgier ""Inside"" was a very welcome change of pace for the band. With ""Redemption"", they seem to have stylistically returned to earlier days with a relatively softer, more melodic sound (with the exception of Steel and Stone perhaps). Lyrically, I thought too much of it was the typical formulaic CCM verse (e.g. ""Jesus""). I would definitely disagree with the assessment that the album as a whole sounds harsh. Many of the songs seem more like light feel good sounds to me. Bright points include ""Looking Glass"", ""Steel & Stone"", and ""Love is Everything"", but if you're looking for the intensity of ""Inside"", an album that was HIGHLY underrated by many fans, look elsewhere."
2,Not that same familiar soothing sound.,"This album was a dissipointment for me. With the musical talent that this band has, I am wondering if the heart is gone out of this band. The songs on this album have a very harsh sound, not showcasing the talents of this group. Perhaps it plays better to a younger crowd. A couple of the better songs on this album are ""The Vine"" and ""Jesus"". You better have some tranquilizers standing by for ""Steel & Stone"". Wow! This album is a definite departure from their old style, trying to mimic the '90s grunge sound. Sometimes you should stick with what you do best."
1,"This book is a coverup of the ""hunger"" industry scandal .","Sweet Charity is a thinly veiled cover-up for the many middle and upper class people benefitting from the ""hunger"" scandal wherein billions of dollars that could and should be spent on poor people are instead wasted on staff, buildings, refrigerators and trucks -- the whole food bank and soup kitchen nine yards. When added to for-profit agribusiness interests whose garbage is dumped into this system for tax deductions and at taxpayers' expense, the ""food"" element of the larger poverty industry makes sense. This book won't tell you that the food banks and soup kitchens often receive legal ""kickbacks"" via tax-deducted charitable ""grants"" from the likes of Procter and Gambol and other giant corporations. If you want the real scoop on another of agribusiness' dirty secrets, read something else. If you don't mind getting hoodwinked, go shopping."

1,Looser book,"The author is far from knowing what palo is, how ever some usesof palos, are real, but the rest he neds to learn."
2,This Maybelline mascara is not what I ordered.,"I wanted waterproof mascara and, the seller stated she had only one in stock. So, this is what I ordered. I just got the mascara and it is: 'lots of lashes'.I wanted 'great lash waterproof'. I am not happy with this at all today. I did not get what I wanted. Disappointed too."
1,"dry, dry, dry...","It was such a good price, so, instead of buying from regular drug store, I ordered from Amazon.com. Well, all four mascaras were dried out. Nothing came out from them. I ended up tossing in the trash. I should have returned them."
3,Ok,"This product does not lengthen,or add volume. It simply darkens your lashes. I personally did not like it. I prefer a mascara that adds volume."

1,New York for New Yorkers: A Historical Treasury and Guide to,"This book is organized in such a way as to make its contents unusable for most readers. All of the buildings and landmarks are presented in chronological order, not by area, which is how guidebooks ought to be organized. Readers have to know when a certain structure was built in order to find it in the book. If the author had strutcured the content by neighborhood, which is how New York is organized, it would be useful and a pleasure to read. If I see a building that I want information on, how do I find it in this book? I don't."
3,Same story as Asa Drakes Crimson Kisses,"Good Dracula Lore -but I think C Dean Andersson and Asa Drake are one and the same, This seems to be an abridged version of Asa Drakes Crimson Kisses (also out of print but available through Amazon sellers). Drakes book is a bit more detailed. Read both. 4 stars for Drake, 3 for Andersson. And if anyone out there knows if the Authors are one and the same, post and let me know."
5,Dracula the Person,When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be the same story that we've all read before. But it's not! It goes deep into Dracula's life and how he felt through out the different stages of his life. I couldn't put the book down for a second! I recomend this book for anyone who wants to get to know who Dracula really is.
5,Fantastic! A wonderfully crafted work.,"Simply one of the most fascinating books Ive ever read. It is one of the very few books Ive read where I kept asking myself ""Is it really possible?..."" Andersson performs a briliant combination with the historical Prince Vlad and the shocking world of the undead. This is a must read for anyone interested in Dracula or Vampires in general. Simply Wonderous !!!"
5,Tzigane holds the mirror into wich i admire my reflection,"if you have a copy of this book, I am willing to pay for it. It is a part of me now that i must have. Please find me at Swallozgoo@aol.com."
3,quite stupid,"the story is stupid and the characters too, but the story is not boring, she's very short. I read it in ancient french so it was sometimes complicated."
2,"well written, but of questionable accuracy","Overall, this book was well written. It provides exhaustive detail about many aspects of Marilyn Monroe's life. The author's conclusions about her death are plausible, even convincing.On the other hand, it is well known that Marilyn Monroe converted to Judaism prior to her marraige to Arthur Miller. Surprisingly there is no mention of this anywhere in the book. Considering the fact that many pages are devoted to tangential aspects of her life, this ommission calls into question the accuracy of the entire work."
2,a chasm of inductive leaps,Spoto spends a lot of time drawing conclusions backed up by flimsy evidence and armchair psychology. It all comes off as a little too Freudian.
4,"sensitive, honest approach to a legendary subject","Donald Spoto has done a good job on writing about Marilyn Monroe's life. Better than some other 'out to make money authors'. His approach is both sensitive and honest. He doesn't make her a joke and she would have liked that at least. And he finally stops those stupid conspiracy theories which keep on circulating regarding MM and JFK and RFK....Marilyn from reading Spoto's book, appears as fragile, sweet, intelligent young woman who was simply also battling her own demons and was complex, sensitive and self-destructive. She was her own enemy and nobody else could have killed her."
5,"A MUST for those who had enough of ""theories""","Most likely we will never be 100% sure of the final hours of Marilyn Monroe on this world, but if I have to believe anything written so far I will go for Donald Spoto's version of the facts.The amount of details on this book are simply amazing and throughout you really have the feeling that you get to know Marilyn from her days as Norma Jean to the superstardom of Marilyn Monroe.All the dates and the research was so amazingly captivating that I could not put the book down once I've started reading it.Straight forward, accurate, precise and concise, I will recommend this book to all of those who still believe that the Kennedy brothers happen to be involved with Marilyn Monroe and her tragic end.10 out of 10"
5,"well-researched, fascinating biography",Spoto's research and treatment of Marilyn's life and death results in one of the most fascinating biographies I've read. It's excellent!
4,Marilyn Monroe: the biography,"This book was well written in depth account of Marilyn's life, non-judgemental, fair , with instances that I hadn't known."
3,Not convinced.....,"I have read many Marilyn biographies and all have inconsistencies.Spoto's version is just the same -- he spends a lot of time pontificating about the details and the aftermath of Marilyn's untimely death.Minute details were also different from other Marilyn bios I have read.Mugsy, her dog, according to Spoto was male and adopted by Marilyn.In another bio, the dog's name is spelled Muggsie is female and was purchased by Jim Dougherty to be a companion to Marilyn during his Merchant Marine days.I figure if writers can't get that small detail correct (both authors claim to have interviewed Jim Doughtery), how can the authors get the real version of Marilyn's death correct?I doubt anyone will ever know the truth about Marilyn's life and death."
4,Kennedy blackout,I was surprised about how the author bought off on the Kennedy boiler plate on both RFK and JFK.The author staked out the stink of the LAPD and FBI angles to his credit.There was much legitimate information that the author revealed and I credit him for that.The reader will need to go elsewhere for the dope on RFK and JFK.
5,"Wonderful book, I recommend it to any Marilyn fan.","This book is informative, captivating and wonderful. I can't put it down. Full of information never read before. I love Marilyn and this book seems to tell all. Some surprises and some heart aching material. I recommend this one to everyone. If you love Marilyn, you'll love this book. I haven't found one as good or well written yet!!"
2,LOTS of details,"If you want to know how many studio musicians were in a particular recording session (17!), or how many policemen, and what type, were needed to control the crowd on a particular day in London when Marilyn was out in public, then this is the book for you. This book is chock full of these and other minute details. It thoroughly documents Marilyn's life, to the point of exhaustion for the reader. But I never got the sense that I knew or understood the real Marilyn."
2,dragging,"this books drags on and on and I feel like I will never get done..... he spends so much time on every person, and all I want to know is about her...."
2,"good bio, but not the truth","spoto gives a lot of details on marilyn's life, but he is definitly hidding the truth about her death. This book was the first bio I read about marilyn, but since that time, I discovered others, better.As a great fan, I suggest "" enquete sur un assassinat"" by don wolfe. I dont know what's the title in english...its the continuation of the biography of anthony Summers. Two great books, and you can feel the last moments of the star, and understand the conspiracy, with official documents , autopsy reports...read it, you will beleive."
3,"Nice shave, but I'm sticking with Mach 3 Power","I hesitate to rate this item low because it really does give a nice shave. However, in comparison to the Mach 3, the Fusion's outrageously priced blades and clownish appearance are something of a step down.The quality of the shave is comparable to Mach 3. Some may quibble about subtle differences (Mach 3 better on the downstroke but Fusion better on the upstroke? :-), but however you slice it, we're well into the domain of greatly diminished returns on additional blades.As near as I can tell, the sixth blade on the back of the razor does... absolutely nothing.The shaving head is approximately the size of a battleship and maneuvers with all the grace of a 1967 Impala."
1,Bad design,"I have used both the powered version and the unpowered version. I like the shaves I get from both, but the design on the blade head is bad. I dont know why I am the only one commenting on it, but I seem to break the connection between the body and the head 40% of the time before I need to replace the head.I have broken it by both banging the body against the side of the sink to clear out the hair, by dropping the razor into the sink, and by packing it in an shave kit and traveling with it.This is a very delicate razor that is very expensive."
1,Stick with the MACH III,Do not buy this product. I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it. My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. It does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I'm back to the MACH III.
3,Fusion Power Razor,The two blade razors made by Gillette gave a much more comfortable shave than this razor.
3,"Equal shave to the M3, not worth the extra money","I've always had this conspiracy theory that when Gillette indroduces a new razor they dull the previous model's blades just a little bit. Oh well, on to the Fusion.I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3. I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it. I'm not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick. I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it. Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out. I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades. Either way it annoys me.To sum it up...sure it's a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else. The M3 is good enough for me."
1,No APO,As a deployed soldier i have to shave every day and dont have the comfort of home like places to do so. These blades are the only ones that WONT cut my face or irritate it. However Amazon does not ship them to APO (military) addresses so i rate the product a 1 with there was a zero button
2,Doesn't cut as close as it should,"This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me. The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all. They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don't think its the case for most people. Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving. I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time."
2,Unjustifiably Expensive,"The Gillette Fusion Power razor resulted in a very poor shaving experience. It definitely didn't give me a very close shave, nor did it make me feel manly.I had never cut myself shaving until I used this razor. Fortunately, vibrating action means you can't even feel the razor's five blades cutting you simultaneously. Wow!Two or three shaves, and the head needs to be replaced. Pathetic. I get more use out of cheap disposable razors."
1,Way overpriced...,Looks like a lot of the positive reviews are straight from Gillette's marketing material. The bottom line is the Fusion does an adequate job of shaving my face but so does my Mach 3..at a much lower price.This seemingly bi-annual ritual of adding blades is getting ludicrous..
2,Close Shave - But Major Razor Bumps,"I bought this razor for my husband, we seen it on a commercial and thought what the heck. After his first shave, his face was super smooth, but the next day he was covered in razor bumps. He's never had that happen with other razor."
2,"To me, it was a hype!","Well my personal opinion:1) I had to put extra force with fusion compared to M3Power2) Shave not closer than M3. I even doubt if it matches M33) Under-nose area is usually the one which doesn't get a clean shave due to these now-a-days wide blades. After shaving my under-nose area with fusion with regular 5 blade side, I tried to see if the side blade can make it any better. BUT....sorry gillette guys.. but I dont think even a single hair was cut."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"The Fusion Power has one distinct improvement over previous Gillette razors: the precision trimmer. It is handy for shaving tricky spots such as the area under the nose and between the upper lip. That being stated, I have not noticed a more comfortable shave with the micro pulses. Also, five blades has not reduced the number of required strokes when compared to the three on the Mach3 Turbo (the number of strokes is the same). Finally, the frequency of having to replace the cartridges does not justify their cost. After only three shaves, the cartridge needs to be changed. The blades for the Mach3 and Sensor product lines last longer. If you shave daily, do not upgrade to this."
1,all hype,I am sticking with my Gillette Sensor with 2 blades -these products are getting to be like a bad SaturdayNight Live Skit - how many blades can we shave with now?More than 2 blades is just diminishing returns andincreasing costs.
1,More blades = More irritation,"I bought into all the hype and picked up a Gillete fusion power to compare against my regular Mach 3 razor. My face was burning after my first shave and sprouted little red bumps. I wanted to make sure the razor was to blame and not something else so for the next two days I shaved my face half and half: Fusion on one side. Mach 3 on the other. On the second day I switched sides. The result? Every time I shaved, the burning side of my face had just been shaved by the fusion. The Mach 3 side was just fine.That burning sensation must me the shave was closer/better right? Wrong. Both sides of my face are equally smooth from both a visual and tactile inspection. The only difference is the burning.Conclusion: Don't buy into the hype. 3 blades are better than 5."
3,"A great shave, but not much better than the Mach-3.","It works really well, and gives a real decent shave; but even with the power on it doesn't really give that much better a shave than the Mach-3. If there is an improvement, it's negligible. Its head's a little bigger than the Mach-3 as well, which isn't a HUGE deal but it noticeable enough. I have used both side by side, and can safely say that both will give you a fantastic shave. It is also a cool looking blade. The battery-powered operation is just gimmicky and doesn't improve your shave a great deal."
2,The shave was not as close as my Mach 3,"I've used the Fusion a couple times now, and the shave is NOT as close as my old Mach 3. After I finish shaving I look like I have an afternoon shadow. I do have thick, dark facial hair, so this may not be a problem for all. In addition, I found the single blade on the back relatively useless as I was able to trim my sideburns and under my nose with the five-blade side. So far, I am not impressed."
2,same ole [...] different packaging,"this is basically the same razor they have been putting out for the past several years, there is really nothing new except one more blade and it vibrates.next they will be raveing about the latest and greatest 20 blade razor when all you need is some good cream and an old fashioned straight or a double edged. i own a fusion but only use it when i have no other choice but the wepon of choice is a tried and true vintage 1960's gillete double edged the cost is higher to start but in the long run the savings cost will more than outweigh the usage of this over hyped [...]."
2,Choose the manual version at all cost (see below).,"The Gillette Fusion is undoubtedly the best razor I've ever used--not only does it give me an incredibly close shave but it also reduces (thanks to the five blades) the need to reshave. I must say, however, that the powered models' great disadvantage is that the ""micropulses and vibrations"" feel fun but can increase the risk of razor burn, nicks and cuts if you lose your grip on the handle. The bottom line: get the manual Fusion over the powered versions for the smoothest shave ever."
4,"Pretty good, though not substantially better than M3 Turbo","This razor works very well and gives a very clean shave, although I would say it is maybe only 20% better than the M3. It was a little rough for my first shave, but that is to be expected with any new top of the line razor. It took me a while for skin to get used to the previous M3 razor as well, but once you are used to these razors, they work very well. This does give an awesome shave, but I don't think it's a whole heck of a lot better than M3. The blade on the back is ok, but is too big for small spaces. It does work nice for trimming the hard to get to corners of my mouth."
2,Waste of Money - Stick With Your Mach 3,"I finally gave in and bought this parody of a razor--and I got taken. Even with its five blades, I am left after shaving with the exact same edges of my chin left rough and unsmooth. I was used to this with my Mach 3, but bought into the fact that two more blades really WERE the answer.The little single trimmer blade? I see it in there, but I definitely don't feel it doing anything. Maybe you have to hold it at just the right angle, I don't know.The absolute worst time to use this razor is after a few days of beard growth. The vibrating blades felt like they were trying to grab the hairs and actually rip them out of my face faster than I could draw the razor across my cheek.Luckily I didn't throw my Mach 3 away. I'll be going back to that."
1,Don't waste your money,"Let me give you one piece of advice: don't buy it. For one simple reason: it is NOT watertight. I will repeat: IT IS NOT WATERTIGHT.I bought one and in a matter of weeks it stopped working. I wrote to Gillette and they were very prompt and polite and within a week they sent me another one. That one only lasted one use in the shower and it stopped working the next day!Guys, I am not kidding: THIS THING IS NOT WATERTIGHT!"
4,does a good job....,"I am a woman; I own both the manual and this power version of the Fusion razors and for shaving legs, I haven't noticed *huge* differences between the two. The power version has a slight advantage in giving a quicker and *slightly* closer shave but if it came down to huge differences in price, for my purpose of shaving legs I could easily go either way.This razor does do an excellent job at getting a close shave and in my experience I find that razors designed for women have not worked any better than this.The only quibble I have is with what I feel is extremely high prices for the refill blades. This is definitely one to compare prices on, coupon shop, and/or catch sales when you can."
1,misleading photo!,"Be careful! The photo shows 8-pack of blades, but the description does not. At this price, it's unlikely the blades are included. I almost purchased this, but stopped when I read the description more carefully."
2,"Ok ""Shaving System"" but dont think price justifies it",It shaves well I just dont think the high price of the blades justifies the price. I dont know that my shave is any better than a razor blade that Gillette made 10 years ago.Joel Simkhai
3,mixed reactions,"I used aGillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 systemfor two years until It finally broke on me last Friday.So I bought this at a local Walmart due to its excellent ratings here. And it worked great on day 1 and 2. Very close and smooth and with less irritation then my old Mach3. However on day three Sunday I didn't leave the apartment so I didn't shave. When I went to shave today. It had trouble cutting the stubble that formed over day and a night. It would cut some and leave others. Some it just teared out. I had to shave twice just to get a clean shave!!! plus Ive only used 3 times and the blade looks like it will need to be replaced soon! And the refills are expensive $25 for 6 retail? You got be kidding me! If I choose to keep this its going to cost me a lot!UPDATE The price of the blades are unreal!!! And They last a bought a week. I have given up on this razor and bought a new Gillette Mach3.And on closer inspection its actually doing a better job on my lower lip."
2,Cant justify the cost.,"It's a decent razor if you dont consider the price. If you are looking to pay this much, I highly recomend the Mach 3 over this razor."
2,Gillette Fusion Power Shaving System,"This razor is very overrated. I purchased the razor with one cartrige and three replacement cartriges. I shaved once a day for one week. I was extremely dissapointed. I went back to the Mach 3 turbo and I returned the three extra cartriges. The Fusion power shaver went into the trash. Please share this review with Gillette. Give them my e-mail address, I would like to hear from them.Thanks, D Hatch"
1,Bad Product,"I got this razor for my husband. It pulled his skin and was a very uncomfortable shave. Neither of us can figure out what the battery ""vibrating"" is supposed to do, but it certainly didn't increase comfort or improve performance. Don't waste your money."
5,Great replacement,This product is just like from the drug store only it was much cheaper and just as easy to acquire
3,leaves me hairless.........,"YES THIS RAZOR CUTS, MY LAST BLADE LASTED 7 MONTHS, REALLY. IM BLOND AND HAVE A LITE BEARD,I USE IT IN THE SHOWER 3 TIMES A WEEK.THE ONE THING IS THE PRICE.25-33$$ A PACK IS ALOT- OH WELL THE RAZOR COP. WILL NOT MAKE AS MUCH $$ ON ME.BUT FOR A BLUE BEARD IT MUST BE ALOT OF $$.IT'S TRUE---BLONDS HAVE MORE FUNN........:)AND SPEND LESS........"
2,better after the 2nd or 3rd time,"My power mach 3 died and I was looking for another. tried this one. the first shave nicked and burned. Knowing that I got multiple shaves form the mach 3 I kept going. After the 3rd shave things got better! but not great, just ok. I have a beard and like to shave every other day. When new this does not work so good but after a couple of shaves, again it is ok. At the cost of these blades I keep going, and going. I lose track of how many times but it is a lot. I shave in the shower so after the first time with the shaving cream I just use lots of water to lightly go over it a second time."
1,inferior to the Mach 3,"I love the Mach 3 and looked forward to this upgrade. However, I cannot get a good shave with it, despite weeks of trying. It's clumsy and just won't get as close as the Mach 3."
2,No big difference,"Folks i have been trying to find a razor that will give me the closest possible shave without all the skin irratation. I thought this was it , but no, the fusion is bulky compared to the Mach 3 the razor on the back is not very sharp/strong and hard to clean it is smoother when u shave but thats about the only difference no closer than the mach 3 i still have to go against the grain to get a smooth close shave . I understand that not everyones face is the same but i have been unable to find a razor that will give me a close shave without going against the grain not even th 5 blade fusion. Cotaray to popular belief the closest and most comfortable shave i have been able to get is from an electric razor the Braun Actviator.So there u have it other than the new fancy look theres really not much difference or advantage over the Mach 3."
2,Power Corrupts,"I received this product as a gift, and I must say that I'm glad I didn't spend money on it myself. The vibration doesn't do one bit of good to make your face smoother. They strapped a battery on a four blade razor as a marketing gimmick. Not a bad razor if it's free, but not worth any extra money paid for the ""power.""!!Attention Gillette!!You can call your next razor Fusion Power Ultra Magnum Viral BOOM Stick and put an mp3 player on it, but that won't necessarily amount to satisfied customers."
2,"Okay shave, but not worth the price.","The ravor gives a good close shave when the blades are fresh, but they wear out way to fast (especially for the price you pay per blade). If you go a few days between shaves this razor has a heck of a time getting through your beard. The space between the blades is so small that stubble gets caught up in there immediately. I didn't notice a closer shave with this than I get with my Mach3. Save your money and go with one of the three blade razors out there. They give you the same shave and cost a lot less"
1,Worst razor I've ever tried.,"I bought this razor based on some reviews and because it was on sale at Costco (with a lot of blades...). From the moment I tried it, I despised this razor. The 5 blades make the experience worse than 1 because they take up so much room you can't get to certain spots on the face. Also, I go through these blades faster than I ever have with a single or 3-blade system. And lastly, the razor cuts my face. The 5 blades is supposed to make the experience easier but it doesn't. I never cut myself with 3-blade systems. Overall, this is a horrible razor and I encourage you to look to others."
3,Good but expensive replacement blades,Close shave and very comfortable.The head flexes and allows for reach into those areas.BUT the replacement blades are expensive!!!I only get 1 week of shave out of it and it costs $3+ to replace3 x 4 thats $12 a month Gillete is making out of me :(
5,Good Buy,"I just bought this after reading through the reviews and reading so much about power protection surge, after I bought my 46 XBR9, I cannot afford to keep it unsafe, so this is the best thing I can provide to safeguard my TV and other equip with it. It was smooth installing all cables and bring back life to all gadgets on the board, I am sure people who buy expensive stuff, buy this."
5,great price & covenient,this protector is in my living room and has everything connected to it and still no problems. bought it lower price than everywhere else. love it.
5,Surge protector,Excellent for many components. The outside outlets swivel allowing for all electrical outlets - large or small to fit.
5,12 plug ins that work! Kudos to Belkin,"An Innovative design which addresses the frustrating plethora of multisized plugs we all encounter, as our electronic apparati grows, and grows, and grows. Nice to see a successful piece of equipment work so well. Kudo's to Belkin."
5,nice price nice product,"works great looks great no problems and we love having the protection, We should have bought more of them . We were glad to see that it has a lifetime warranty as well. Added bonus....."
5,Does the job,"I only use it for power, but there's more features to it. It's been two months and it's working fine."
5,This definitely does the job,"I don't have to worry about surges with this! I can fit all my plugs and wall warts on it and still have plenty of room. The little snap closure to put my cords through is an extra bonus. And, when not using the equipment on it, I can just turn it off. High ratings from me!"
5,Very good,If you have different kinds of power adapters for different devices this is perfect device since each power connection swivels and makes it easy to accommodate any kind and shape of the power adapter.
2,"Perfectly serviceable, but...","This is a perfectly serviceable solution to our need for a power strip to accommodate a community worth of cell phone chargers, but the pivots are tight and the whole thing takes a bit of muscle to use. Other solutions out there seem like they might be a little easier and more seamless to use."
4,"Bar portion great, wall plug is terrible.","Bought this for a very specific purpose but others will probably find it quite useful as well. I do clinical trials on occasion and people frequently want to plug in a lot of random stuff to a limited amount of outlets. I figured this swivel system would work great for assorted cell chargers and such that don't fit next to each other without the issues I have with power squids where they just fall off anything you set them on. The swivel system does work fantastic for this purpose however the wall plug isn't a flat plug... it's an old style standard plug that sticks straight out from the wall, it's the dumbest design I could possibly think to use on a surge protector that's obviously otherwise designed to solve all sorts of obscure plug problems, fortunately I found some little 6"" cord adapters that have flat plugs so I just plugged this into one of those and it's better now, still annoys me that it doesn't have a flat plug by default though."
5,Convenient,I love it! I love it!You need to try this device! It is worth buying as all your appliances can be plugged at once and are safe. The rotation plugs are flexible.
3,"Yeah, its just a power strip.","The adjustable heads seem really cool and allow for a lot of flexibility with plug size. Still, its only a power strip. It sits behind your TV and nobody sees it. If you don't have a lot of plugs, its worth buying something cheaper."
1,Don't Buy.........,"it look like one of does thing that should work forever......WELL, only if forever mean ONE week :(.. its DEAD now.. i try to call the seller, no luck so far"
1,broken,"I like it alot for the versatility but one whole side does not work. So they shipped me a surge protector that only partially works. I need it now, since my other surge protector is ruined since it sat on the heater and warped. I cant afford the down time of taking it and sending it in for a replacement. It would have been a great part if it wasnt prtially broken."
4,Great Surge Protector if you need MANY plugs.,"I just finished building my own PC which has a 1200 Watt Power Supply. I looked at some Back-UPS but they are like super expensive, so I decided to look for a surge protector that could handle that Wattage instead. I found this Belkin Surge Protector and I have to say it is a very awesome product. Quality wise, I would rate it 4 stars due to the fact that its Power button switch feels kind of flimsy, which makes me wonder it if will eventually dislodge or something; but other than that this product offers GREAT space saving attributes. The pivot plugs are awesome since you can connect items that have bulky Adapters to it next to each other, and the only thing you need to do is rotate the plug...voila! No problem whatsoever connecting them. This Surge Protector has a VERY high Wattage capability (~1850W) so it protects my PC PLUS other equipment easily. For the price and its specifications it is an awesome deal! Highly Recommended!"
2,Warranty is a scam,"3 outlets failed within 5 months of owning this !!I called Amazon, they said that they wont take it back because it is a warranty issue -- and said to call BelkinI called Belkin, (the customer support line is overseas and has a VERY bad connection with people who can barely speak English) and they want me to pay the return shipping (Even though it is within warranty-- and it is obviously a faulty product !!!)THis is the first company I ever had a return with who actually expects the customer to pay for shipping when the product is FAULTY and within warranty !!!I don't plan to buy from Belkin ever again"
3,bad outlets,"the rotating outlets are okay, and the closing cable clip is a nice touch.But 3 of the outlets on the middle strip are faulty... they have some dust sleave thing that opens up when you put the plug in, except it doesn't line up with the internal mechanisms. and also when i finally got the plug to go in from alot of wiggling and force, the plug doesn't stay in. it falls out very very easily, which is horrible for electronics, which is what i purchased this power bar for.Dissapointing Purchase @_@"
2,Power On / Off was broken out of the box.,"I was excited to snag this during the holiday sales for $20 but bummed when I got it. The power button was busted and I didn't even get a chance to plug it in. Seemed very flimsy and not built well at all which I see is something written about belikin protectors more than once on here. I sent it back with no hassles at all so that was great. I'm going to give another belkin 12 outlet a shot, not this one, and hopefully it works out."
3,Belkin,"I purchased the Belkin 12 outlet surge protector because I was in powercord jail and needed an outlet/surge protector for a lot of cords. The Belkin's advertisement that the outlets on the outside of the device are specifically for the larger adapters. All of the adpaters are larger than what Belkin provides and so I still can't plug the adpaters in side-by-side, I have to leave an outlet blank in between them. The device would be much better if it were longer and thus allowing more space inbetween the adapter plug ins. The other this about this device is that the outlets down the middle have a plastic thing blocking them so when you first go to plug in something it won't go in smoothly, you have to REALLY, REALLY push hard so that it breaks the plastic in the plug (Kind of hard to explain). I'm not sure why it was set up this way, but it is a pain!"
1,two defective units in a row,"I originally purchased two of these items. The first one I opened worked fine - as advertised. The second unit would not accept plugs in one of the central sockets. No plugs, no how. These were plugs that fit well - first time every time - in other surge protectors that I own.I received my replacement unit and this time two sockets would not accept any plugs. So, I'm thinking, cheap Chinese manufacturing. I returned the second unit for a refund."
5,Excited over a power strip???,"It is hard to get excited about a surge protector, but here I make an exception. The design and functionality Belkin put into this one are fantastic. For me, the rotating side plugs are almost like getting additional outlets since I usually lose one or more plugs due to the shape of my power supplies. Belkin also built in a basic cord organizer on the non-cord end of the unit; snap it up, put your cords through, snap it down, and you have less risk of tangles.I am using this as an office power supply and it is perfectly meeting my needs: computer, monitor, speakers, phone charger, external hard drive, modem, router - with lots of room to spare. Definitely worth a few extra dollars - you won't have to compromise or buy a second surge protector."
3,Pleased so far with the new Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge,This is my second one. The first started to shut down automatically after two years. I had to keep turning it on and a few seconds later off it went. Couldn't understand why. I purchased a second because the pivot-plug feature is very useful and quite frankly there isn't another surge like it in the market. Time will tell whether I will experience the same on/off problem with this second surge.
5,Swivel Outlets are Convenient,Mounted easily to wall receptacle. No power cord to contend with. Outlets swivel permitting plug insertion from the side resulting in an unobtrusive installation. There is no stated joules rating as with most brands lately.
2,Where are the specs?,"Amazon has a boat-load of surge protectors here; yet they inform you of everything, but the surge capability. Who cares how long the chord is and how many plugs it can take, if it does not list the Joule rating and clamping times. I am no expert; but at least I would like some specs on the ""surge suppression"" not the chord length and color, or number of lights, etc. The prices look decent, and the selection is very good; but what am I getting? Another thing Amazon does with their adds, is they leave the price off many of there ads; until you dig three pages deep into the promo. I would be more likely to buy, if I could compare, without loading each and every item on the screen. This page does not have that problem, but many others do; such as the ten hot deals for electronics, I get E-mailed. I delete them, because it takes way too much time, to price compare each item listed. I have wasted enough time looking for specs here, on this item. Prices and selection look good."
3,"bulky and ugly, but works just fine",I like the pivoting sockets. it allows me to plug in more than I normally could. But the thing is ugly!
2,American Electrical Appliances.,"This or any Electric appliance from America will not be compatible to Australian Electric System (it is 240Volt, 500watt system) and there are no Known Adapters to compensate the connection. So I hope other Australian Buyers are aware of this before ordering from American based Online stores. This is Bob Sayer and as you may be aware I ordered A sanyo Microwave/convection and had to stop the order after reading it's specification chart.So when I was asked to rate this item I beleved it was the only way I could convey this information, Best regards Bob Sayer."
1,Belkin Pivot - Plug Surge Protector,"I gave this one star because I returned the unit to Amazon. Not that it was bad, but decided to use something more substantial to protect my new 55"" TV. So, I ended up purchasing a Uninteruppted Power Supply (UPS)and surge protector. I feel much better protected now."
3,Nice surge protector but could be modified,This surge protector gives you pretty good functionality. Having the ability to pivot the outlet helps out a lot. I wish there was more space between each outlet so you can plug in bigger power cords. Overall good product.
4,Surge Protector,"Got in great time and in good condition. Lots of plugs, so I can remove other extra surge protectors to save space."
3,Surge protector,"I purchased this item to replace 3 old strip surge protectors under my computer desk. I liked the idea of 12 plugs and being able to direct the plugs in different directions: however, when you place different sized plugs in, it can present problems. The plug does not always go all the way into the plug creating no power to the item. You have to be very careful so they do not move out of the socket. I had all kinds of problems getting all my plugs in a position so they would all have power. It was very frustrating to say the least. It is an item I give only a fair rating for these reasons. The idea is a good one which needs further research on the manufacturer's part to make it a workable solution to the problem of too many plugs, too many strips."
5,Huge capacity for plugs!,"This is a great power strip. Pivoting plugs are very effective. Still useful to have some 1' plug-saver cords for some of the bricks. It is a bit large, but I still managed to fit it inside of an IKEA bookcase cubicle (though I might have some trouble when I add the door unit)."
1,Bad power switch,"I ordered three of these for the Home Theater and office set-ups. I utilized all the strip to minimize ""vampire appliance"" and turn the strips off every night. All of them failed in less than one year due to the bad switch. It may be the springs under the power button that wears out. It is a design flaw that needs to be address."
1,Bogus,"Bought this based on price and warranty for connected electronics. Bottom line, Belkin's surge protectors don't work and their warranty is a joke. Power surge at our home fried power supplies to Samsung 46"" LED, Sony AVR and XBox 360 that were plugged into the Belkin surge protector...~$1k damage. After following to the letter Belkin's instructions, we filed a claim. Belkin sent a letter stating they tested our unit and it was functioning normally without damage. Claim denied. When we asked to get a copy of their test results, they refused, told us the unit and results were internal confidential information. Only recourse is to sue. NO MORE BELKIN!!!"
4,Works Well,"Purchased this surge protector for my computer,modem,printer,router and telephone. I like how you can adjust the position of some of the outlets to obtain a better fit and keep the cluster of plugs separate. Works as advertised, what more can you ask for."
5,Great product and highly recommended,"Excellent item, and gobbled up the dozen or so power cords that I have on my stereo cabinet. The spacing is a lifesaver, and allows several large plugs to be attached without wasting the neighboring ones. Works exactly as I was expecting."
5,Good Surge Protector,"Very good quality, features and price. Turned out that I didn't really need the pivot sockets, but that's OK to have anyway. Haven't had a power surge to verify the protection, but the specs look good."
4,More plugs than I can shake a transistor at,"Pros- having the outside plugss pivot is great, the amount of space between plugs is great, mounts easily to screw(not included.) fantastic product.)Cons - has a connection for phone jack. this is unnecessary."
2,Center Plugs: Just as bad as everyone claims,"I wish I'd read more reviews before choosing this surge protector. The ""Belkin"" name and pivoting side sockets seemed like a sure thing, though.The pivoting plugs, for what its worth, are OK. They give me the 8 sockets I needed to replace an older, smaller surge protector, but the stationary sockets in the center are garbage. Only two of them are aligned properly to allow any sort of use. The top and bottom center sockets won't accept anything, no matter how hard the plugs are wiggled or forced; they'll just provide you with plenty of bent up plugs.Give your business to a manufacturer who deserves it."
5,Nice Surge Protector,"I just received this item in the mail today and I have some initial first impressions to share. First, it's a little longer than I anticipated, but the construction is very solid. Second, it's a shame that all eight outlets don't rotate because it's such a handy feature; two of mine are rotated right now and all eight are in use. I will definitely consider these pivot surge protectors from Belkin in the future whenever I need to purchase one."
3,Pivot surge,its alright screw isnt long enough thats supposed to hold it in place but stays in the socket well enough.
5,Belkin Pivot-Plug surge protector,Great Pivot plug for all thoes bulky square plug in cords. If your cord won't fit just turn the pivot plug and presto. No Problem. Its Great and it works. It has plenty of outlets to go around.I just love it.
4,Belkin Pivot Plug Surge Protector,"This item is great! I have my home theatre system hooked up to it and feel very confident in using it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is I specifically ordered this model because it had a flat plug (to allow for more room and putting a desk/cabinet closer to it and the wall) and the item that came did not have that. I was able to work around this issue, so I kept the item. Other than that, I am truly satisfied with it."
3,It's OK,It is pretty useful for my application. Several of the receptacles would not accept my plugs but they fit in other receptacles. The tie down clip is useless for a lot of cables. I can not comment on the function only the connectability.
5,Very Pleased with my surge protector.,"For the price, the ability to have 12 plugs and be able to adjust the position of 2 of the 4 plugs to allow for differently oriented plugs, is VERY nice.I will update after the first major storm to review how it holds up to an electrical surge which is prone in the rural PA area."
5,Great design,The outside plugs swing down so you can plug in more of those bulky plugs. This is a great product!
5,Fantastic,This power plug has allowed me to rearrange my whole set up easily and thank god I'm finally able to plus everything in!
2,A Cleverly Designed Power Strip Flawed By Quality Control Issues,"I purchased this power strip for use with some audio equipment. When I received it I was impressed with its clever design. However, the moment that I plugged the Belkin in, the power light came on without my pressing the power button.I thought that I could just turn the unit off by pressing the button again, only to find thatthe button was broken.From the reviews of this product on Amazon.com, this is a common problem. I have used Belkin audio cables in the past and like them. However, this is one product that I would avoid from the company until they can implement better quality control procedures."
4,Very efficient,This works very well. lots of plugs to use for all your gizmos. One problem I find though is the plugs are a little loose and heavier plug adapters like you get with some routers or game consoles tend to lean back and hang out of the socket a bit before having enough of an angle to hold its self in instead. To resolve this I just flipped it so that plug adapter was oriented so it was resting on the ground and the strip rested on it. Not a problem for me but anyone maybe trying to have this on a wall or else where could be a problem and your plugs could fall out of the strip.
2,Poor quality power switch,I bought this power surge protector after good reviews here on Amazon. Within a year the power switch stopped working. This is second Belkin power product which failed in short period.
5,Fully satisfactory,"I bought three for different locations in the house. They work fine. Some of the commentators say they have trouble using the central four sockets, but I've had no trouble with them at all.I like the pivoting sockets. I suppose it's for their own convenience and not for mine that manufacturers ship their products with plugs that make multiple sockets unusable. With the Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protector, I don't have to hunt up an additional power strip just because I want to plug in one more thing.The guarantee is very impressive, too."
1,does not last,"Product only lasted for a few months. Once the internal circuit gets flipped, it's fried. There is no reset button. This is my second attempted with this product, and once again, it was a disappointment."
2,Does NOT have a right angle plug!,"I purchased this surge protector for four key features:- right angle plug- slim straight line (single outlet wide strip, not a double)- pivoting outlets- blackIt does not have a right angle plug. The Technical Details and Product Description claim it has a right angle plug, and even the picture on the box the surge protector came in shows a right angle plug, but the picture above, and the picture provided by the manufacturer on their website, shows a standard outlet plug.The pivot outlet feature is only moderately helpful.Extremely disappointing.If it had a right angle 45 degree offset plug, this would have been a great surge protector.I purchased a slim straight-line (single outlet wide) unit with a right angle plug from another manufacturer.What a shame."
5,Great,"The only flaw I found was trying to use the plugs in the middle. They seem to have a cover on the inside that is set to open when another one is used. I haven't caught on to it yet, but, lol, I haven't tried to either."
5,Great in the gig bag!,"I have one of these in my gig bag after using one at the house for a few months. I can plug in my amp, keyboards, and effects pedals with no worry. The pivoting outlets are great."
5,Great price. Solid construction.,Not much to say. Plenty of space between outlets for different plug configurations. The ability to pivot the outside plugs is great.
3,Great design with small flaw,"I currently have this mounted upside down under my desk and it works great. The swivel connectors are a fantastic feature. I probably have about 8 things currently plugged into the surge protector.One flaw though is that it emits a very high-pitched noise occasionally. It seems like the sound is tied to power usage. If I wasn't constantly listening to music at work, I would probably get rid of this item due to how annoying the high-pitched sound is."
5,Durable. Works excellent.,"Bought this for home enterainment center. Works very well, rotating plugs helps with big bulky plugins. Seems durable, couldn't ask for it to do anymore really. Would like to see one improvement or option on a better model: retractable cord."
5,Great surge protector,Was very impressed with this item. Protection is superior. Have two more on the way so everything I have of value is protected. Buy it!
3,tired of working now?,recently the power switch had to be hold-in with thump until it can hold on.Other than that it was working fine.Wondering if I can get a replacement?
5,exceptional,This product defines mobility. Numerous cords attaches itself in ways you would not think of.PIVOT is the word.
5,Nice-and saves me money,"This is a nice surge protector. I haven't had to deal with ANY dimming lights with one surge protector for each plug in for major appliances; two air conditioners, a computer, a bass guitar with a 280 watt amp, and refrigerator. I currently did a average-bill-pay with my electricity company and settled for $58 a month. Now that I have several of these surge protectors; my electricity bill is lower than my average bill-pay and my appliances work a lot better. Good deal."
4,good value,"plenty of outlets, 8 swivel for easy plugs for brick power supplies. Hasn't been tested yet, lol, I don't think"
4,Belkin surge protector,What an awesome product! 4 fixed & 8 rotating outlets for a total of 12. That's plenty. Thanks to the rotating outlets I managed to plug in all my computer and TV appliances and still have a few remaining slots. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because I would like the rotating outlets to be spaced a little farther apart from each other enough to plug in big adapters side by side instead of plugging small plug big plug small plug...
5,Now My Wires Are Organized!,"I recently purchased two of these Belkin adapters. In the past I haven't worried about the mess of wires required for my computers but when it got to the point where I was plugging one power strip into another to power all of my devices I decided I needed to do something.There is plenty of space for big bulky adapters including my cell phone adapter, printers, scanner, etc. as well as regular power cords to be plugged in. I have had these for about a little over a month and am very satisfied with them."
1,Beware! Totally exasperating product that failed quickly,"I purchased this Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protector product from Amazon less than 3 months ago in late June 2010. A recent power failure during a rain storm (suburb Philadelphia, PA) resulted in the loss of my desktop, Compaq Presario's C-drive requiring the full recovery option of restoring Win XP operating system and all contents of the C-drive, email, software, etc., - the works - contained therein permanently LOST. The sole, important function that this fancy powerstrip is claimed to do FAILED in a matter of months. Intend to take it up with Belkin, but that does not restore the harm that's been done. Horrible!"
4,wow,"it was large and expensive but well worth it. i have a desktop, tv, and satellite box plugged in and haven't had any issues during inclimate weather. great product - totally worth the price."
5,Surge Protector,Product is of excellent quality and one of the best surge protectors I have ever purchased. Has lots of flexibilty for numerous pieces of equipment that need to be protected.
5,Just bought my third one,"Gone are the days when you have to have a huge bar surge protector with a fat cord for your laptops and TV's. This has worked perfectly in our bedroom (34"" HD, Blu-ray DVD player and 2 laptops)and our daughter's (32"" HD and Xbox 360). Time to get one for downstairs. We do have however a more powerful Belkin surge protector for our 52"" plasma TV. I need this one for my laptop downstairs and I love the versatility of the pivot outlets, cool design."
4,No USB port ;0(,"I like it! Especially love the sturdy individually pivoting outlets. Would love it more, though, if there was a USB port or two to charge my portable devices."
4,"Great price, free shipping and quick delivery",Amazon's price was about half the other local and on-line retailers. Nice big warranty and had all the features that I want to protect my home audio equipment (see CNET on what to look for in a surge protector). So far I'm very happy with the device and features.
1,Belkin Surge Protector,I ordered two of these surge protectors. One of them would not power off so I returned them both and ordered two Monster surge protectors. I pushed the on/off button at lease a dozen times and it would not power down. I much prefer the rocker switches that Monster uses. I am very please with the Monster Surge protectors.
3,Disappointed,"So, I bought this surge protector because it looks nice, has lots of outlets, and guarantees protection, which I needed for my TV.When I received it, I was happy and excited to try it out. I plugged in all my cords into my new Belkin Surge Protector, starting with the side swivel outlets. So far so good. But when I got to the middle outlets, the cords wouldn't fit. It seemed like the outlet is too small for the cord I was inserting. Thinking there might be a problem with the specific cord I was using, I tested the outlet with all the other cords I have; none fit.So, instead of a 12 outlets, I got 8. Wack. But at least the 8 that are usable work well, I guess..."
2,Power Button Wears Out,Worked great for about two years then the power button gave out. Had to throw away I needed to turn this surge protector on and off each time I used it. If you leave on it is not a issue.
5,Very nice product,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, I really like the rotating outlets. Also, this surge protector provides a lot of surge protection at a reasonable price."
5,Belkin nailed it,"Like a lot of people these days, I have a desktop computer in my office at home and I have many electronics that I'm always relying on for my daily computing needs. This is a 12 surge protector that is giving the opportunity to plug different types of electronic devices (regular, grounded or adapters). The flexible pivot-plug technology allow us with the flexibility of having all cords organized. The cord of the surge protector is long and thick enough to guarantee the best performance. Very solid and stable device. I'll recommend it and I'll look for something like this one more time."
2,"When did ""Excelent"" become a gradable attribute?","It's not quite excellent. This surge protector seemed like a good idea but the outlets down the center of it are, apparently, not aligned properly. I had to use considerable force to seat plugs in the first two positions. The second two would not allow a plug to be fully seated leaving about an 1/8' of the bare metal plug exposed. For safety reasons I chose not to use these two positons. That's disappointing but not worth the trouble and expense to return. I'll live with it and know that the Belkin name isn't what it used to be. The rest of the unit seems to work just fine."
5,Fit our needs,Love the pivot feature of this device. Has plenty of outlets for office/TV set-up. Fit our needs and shipped quickly.
4,"Creative design, traditional stuff, seems used","The picture looks much better than the actual product, much bigger too. Mine came in dirty, undoubtably it was used, but it works so Im keeping it."
5,Jerad approves,I purchased this produce for a fish tank because I had large balky timers and didnt want 3 surge protectors for the tank. I expect to fit my 8 plugs into the spaces and have no additional room. It turned out I was able to have 2 extra plug spots. I think that they could have a longer cord but other than that I am very satisfied with this product. If it had 6 ft longer cord I would have bought 2 more for other things around the house.
4,80.00 Retail?,"This is a good Surge Protector, but 80.00 RETAIL!, seems over inflated. It is worth 30.00 though. Very flexible, and 4200ju is a plus. The reviewer who says you can't use the center plug-ins must be afraid to push in a little harder or needs to return it for a new one."
5,1 in everyroom :),I had just an aux box for my desktop.now that i bought this item.its awsome.space saver.bit organized.easier to handle/manage.great item.im deff. getting one in my living room too.
5,Surge protector,Best thing I ever bought for all the plugs on my computer. The usual is 6plugs and this has double that. I love it.
1,I don't get it,So many positive reviews so I gave it a try based on price. The thing is heavy and if you accidentally hit with your foot (it's under my desk on the wall) it moves and comes out of the wall....which turns everything off like my computer!Fine something more sturdy OR something that can stick on the wall solid.
3,No right angle plug!,"I can't say yet how well it works, because it won't fit where I planned. I ordered and received the 6'/8 outlet version (there are multiple sizes/configurations on this page), and I was disappointed to discover that it does not have a right-angle plug, even though that is one of the features listed."
3,Doesn't do what it's supposed to!,Works fine with 2 things plugged in but with the first one I bought it broke when I connected three things to it and the same happened with the second one I bought.
5,Great,"I love the fact that the sockets swivel, and that you can anchor it to the wall. I recommend it"
1,Middle plug sets defective,"The middle set of plugs don't accept connections properly. They will hardly accept any plugs without a lot of pressure and forcing. How hard is it to make a plug receptacle?Way too expensive for this type of problem, skip it."
1,Warranty isn't worth the paper it's printed on,"I've had this surge protector in use for my home thearer system for several years. A recent electrical storm and lightning strike came through this ""surge protector"" and fried 3 pieces of equipment. I submitted a claim to Belkin and received a letter stating that there was nothing wrong with their surge protector and denied all claims. If you think Belkin will stand behind its ""Warranty"" and actually fix or replace your equipment, I've got a bridge to sell you in NYC. BTW, another company's surge protector (Trip Lite) was hooked to my fax machine which got fried during the same strike and they (Trip Lite) reimbursed me IN FULL for the cost of my Canon printer-fax. Buy from Trip Lite"
1,"Lifetime warranty, but return shipping is on YOU though defective!","Since I purchased this, I had to replace twice as there's always defective outlet or two (the first unit had 3 outlets not working). Every time you'll have to pay the shipping cost back to them though this comes with life time warranty, and Belkin DOES replace the product for you, the shipping cost back to Belkin is on YOU. It doesn't matter it's defective and it's not your fault, but you'll have to pay for the shipping anyways, as they said that's their ""policy"". I replaced them twice, and still ended up with on outlet not working, but I gave up. I don't want to pay close to $10 every time to ship it back to them anymore. I'll just avoid Belkin outlet altogether in the future."
1,lousy product,I have purchased TWO of these and BOTH have been defective. The center 4 outlets do not recievce plugs. Belkin customer service was a waste of my time.
3,This works fine but...,"For the most part this handles most of plugs I need to use. However, there are some issues when using polarized or three pronged transformers. I wish the outlets were a bit more spaced apart, but otherwise not a bad surge protector."
5,Belkin Surge Protector is great,"I bought the Belkin Surge Protector on Cyber Monday and am very pleased with this product. It is extremeluy well made and contains 12 places for connections. I truly like the fact that the plug connections on the two sides pivot to accommodate heavier plugs which is the norm for electronics. Great product at a good price. This product is a must in Florida, the lightning capital."
5,It has 12 outlets.,I bought this to protect my new computer. It has 12 outlets and coaxial cable F-type connectors. The pivot plug on the outside are handy.
4,Does the job,the swivel plugs are nice. The power button seems cheap. Has worked as intended. The connected device insurance is nice if honored
2,bad quality,"After readin so many good reviews i decided to buy this surge protector for my new home. yes, I have read that there are a few complaints about blocked sockets, but i didn't think i would be so unluncky, but turns out i am... It does have a nice design to it but the quality is not so good at all. I have to go through the return process so i just didn't bother with a surge protector."
4,Not the best design,If you have multiple large chargers plugged in you will be hard pressed to utilize all of the outlets you may need to purchase some extensions like5-Pack 1ft POWER STRIP OUTLET EXTENDER / OUTLET SAVER / POWER EXTENSION CABLE. Other than that it works great.
5,Surge Protector,"This is the Surge Protector that I have been shopping for. Thinks for the fast service, and at a price I was looking for."
2,an overpriced book with thin content,"I found the content of this book too thin to justify the price. There was really not much stuff in it that I didn't already know, which is a shame considering that I have never been trained in acting. As a character animator, I also find the title somehow decieving since most of the topic could be covered in any acting book and in most parts, it was not really animation related. I wish I had spent my money on a general purpose acting book with more content."
2,"They work, but Rayovac rechargeables are better","You'll spend a lot less money in the long run if you buy rechargeable batteries. Rayovac's IC3 batteries recharge in only 15 minutes and a single charge outlasts these Alkaline batteries. Plus, every time you avoid throwing heavy metal garbage into the waste stream you are helping to save the planet."
5,Consumer Centric,"Both Mssrs Mathews and Crawford have a wealth of consumer industry and strategy experience between them. This book helps to boil down the essence of their strategic advice into practical and focused approaches to consumers and business priorties. Too many business books deal with theory and assumption, while The Myth of Excellence builds from an underlying framework of consumer research coupled with keen business insight. An enjoyable read as well as informative."
4,"I'd agree- A must read for ""C"" level managers.",This book updates us on some very interesting and important buying patterns that are emerging. It goes on to point out five areas of differentiation for any organization. There are a few handy tools and loads of examples.*** If you read 5+ buiness books a year make this one.
4,Entertaining and Enjoyable,"Absolutely Normal Chaos is an easy-to-relate-to book that is actually pretty funny sometimes. Mary Lou is an interesting character and in general, I really liked this book."
4,carl ray!,"i love this book! i like sharon creech's way of writing. walk two moons was a good book too. my favorite character in this book was carl ray! he is funny in a weird way. it was kind of predictable tho, but still, i liked it alot."
3,Absolutely Normal Chaos was an enjoyable book,"Absolutely Normal Chaos was an exceptional book. I do think though, that it was better than Sharon Creech's other book, Absolutely Normal Chaos. I liked how Absolutely Normal Chaos was in journal form, even if it was harder to understand. (...)I suppose Mrs. Creech likes irony because there's more when Carl Ray comes to Mary Lou's house in the other book and finds his biological dad whom he had been searching for, next door in Absolutely Normal Chaos. This book was mainly about young love and taught some people not to fall in love to early. Always wait for the right time or you'll get hurt. I had lots of fun reading Absolutely Normal Chaos.(...)"
5,Absolutely Normal Chaos,"If you haven't read Absolutely Normal Chaos, I've read it and it is a great book.It is the about a thirteen year old girl named Mary Lou Finney.Before school gets out for the summer her english teacher tells everyone that they have to write in a journal over the summer and give it to their new english teacher,Mary Lou was so interested that she did more than one journal because she wrote every day,and sometimes she would write alot.Mary Lou is one curious thirteen year old.If you are looking for a great book to read Absolutely Normal Chaos is the book to read."
3,Absolutely Normal Chaos,"I love, love, love ALL of Sharon Creech's other books, but for some reason, this one just didn't do it for me. I think it is kind of boring, and not a lot happens. For one thing, I am not much of a mushy gushy romantic person, and that seemed to be one of the main focuses of the book. I didn't like that part. I really didn't feel like I got to know the characters very well. Those are just my opinions and you may feel very differently, but I think if you want a good Sharon Creech book, you'd be better off reading Bloomability or Walk Two Moons!(...)they are mostly from a 13-year-old's point of view."
5,Very intersting book!,"This might be on my top 5 best books Iv'e ever read. This is about a girl named Mary Lou Finney that has to keep and record a journal over the summer. But the thing that she didn't know that all the intersting things would happen that summer. She got carried away, that she wrote 6 journals. Some of the things that are intersting are that her cousin Carl Ray (boring cousin) comes down to stay at their house. But at their suprise Carl Ray was hiding something and Mary Lou has to figure out. And her friend Beth Ann thats crazy over boys. Then she goes over to Carl Ray's house in West Virginia which doesn't have electricity or plumbing. She has a very fun adventure when she goes there. This book I thought was much better then ""Walk Two Moons"". This had much more action than Walk Two Moons. This book was very funny at times and this book had drama and fighting. It had most of all genres. I would reccommend this book to anyone. It was a great book!! Ü"
5,THE BEST!!!,"I have read this book so many times, it's getting torn up! I love it. It has humor, real life situations, and interesting events. It's all about Mary Lou Finney who has to write a journal over the summer for English. This book so entertaining that you MUST READ IT!!!!!!! It is absolutely a must have for all bookworms. Even if you don't like books, wow, this one will change your mind!"
4,Life from a 13 year old Girl's view!,"Mary Lue Finney, a middle school student is assigned to do a journal over the summer. What starts out to Mary Lue as a boreing homework assignment turns out to be the story of her sorrowful, frustrating, romantic,mysterious,and outragious summer vacation. I rated it 8 only because I enjoyed Sharon Creech's, ""Chasing Red Bird"", and my favorite, ""Walk Two Moons""books more, but this novel is still a masterpiece."
5,"I really, really loved this book!!!!!!!!","This story is about Mary Lou Finney who is thirteen years old and is told by her old English teacher to write a journal to give to her new English teacher in September.Mary Lou's cousin, Carl Ray comes up to look for work.And Mary Lou has to be his maid.She complains about that, but how was she supposed to know about Carl Ray or Alex Cheevy? I'm not going to tell you the ending because you should read the book to find out. I think it will come as a shock!!!!!"
4,A Real Kids Book!!!,I enjoyed the book but thought it was a little on the disorganized side. Overall it was a very enjoyable book for those who like funny books that make you laugh. If you like books with deeper meanings this is not the book for you. Although it was not my favorite book I did associate with the main character and her hectic family and personel life. This book is perfect for kids looking for fun summer reading.
5,One of Sharon Creech's Best!!!,"I read this book last summer and it took me less than two days to finish it. It's a short, fast-paced, funny story about a girl name Mary-Lou who basically has to write a summer journal for school and she tells all about her summer--which is actually a whole lot better than mine!Mary Lou Finney is also a character in the ever-so-famous Walk Two Moons."
4,Quirky...,"This story takes place through one summer. It is about a fourteen year old girl who tries to cope with her large, loud, quirky family. I love the characters, they are wonderfully imagined and yet people that everyone can relate to.This story is about Mary Lou's process of dealing with her first boyfriend, her best friend and her first journal.I reccomend this story to 11 to 14 year olds."
2,Not worth your time 2,"Man, when I finished this book, I was very depressed. I thought this book would talk about some interesting things and hopefully I will learn something useful. But noo... Mary-Lou proved to a foolish girl and I really felt I wasted my time reading a novel all about kissing that seems fake."
2,Stick with Walk Two Moons,"I thought that this book was boring, uninteresting, not suspensful, and very dreary, especailly compared to Walk Two Moons. Mary Lou Finney does not in any way connect to the reader, she is boring and too much of your 'average, all-american teenager.' my advice, stick with Walk Two Moons."
4,The only safe place was upstairs,"The story takes place during the Second World War, from 1938 through 1945. In Winterswijk, close to the Germany border. Annie and her dad listen to the radio a lot to hear about all of the news that's going on. Annie's mom and dad argue a lot. Annie is eight years old in the beginning. Rachel, Annie, and Sini are all sisters. They are also all Jewish. After the war started Annie and Sini go live with the Oostervelds, and they stay in their upstairs room for two years. While they were there their mother died. The Oostervelds are Opoe, Johan, and Dientje. I liked this book because it explained how the war was back then, and a lot of details."
2,Definitely Not Sharon Creech's Best Work,"After reading Walk Two Moons and The Wanderer, this book was a big disappointment. The other Sharon Creech books that I have read left me feeling good and thinking about various life issues. This book, however, just seemed to be lacking substance. Although it is somewhat humorous and mildly entertaining, it had no real depth to it. The characters were not very true-to-life or believable, and the way that the plot ended up fitting together was totally far-fetched and unrealistic. If you are just looking for a somewhat entertaining book then you may enjoy this, but if you are looking for a truly worthwhile reading experience with substance and depth then this is probably not the book for you. Read Walk Two Moons or The Wanderer instead."
3,interesting summer for a 13yo girl,"I enjoyed this book. Mary Lou has her first crush and kiss. Her friend is boy-crazy. Her cousin comes to visit. A neighbor dies. Lots of stuff. And, in the end, it is all tied together neatly. With, even, a perhaps not necessary serious accident.Here is my big question and surprise. I kept checking and checking to see when it was written. Published 1990. But it reads like a Beverly Cleary's Ramona time period. Just not modern at all.A fine read, though."
4,Not bad.,"The writing in this book was all together refreshing (sounding just like thirteen-year-old girl) and the characters are interesting--both strange and exciting at the same time. But...there is something wanting, like the author accidently forgot to put something in. I don't know...maybe Creech's award-winning book ""Walk Two Moons"" put my expectations high. So maybe I should have read this one first, maybe that would let me see the full charm and fun of this book. Instead, I was just constantly comparing it to ""Walk Two Moons""."
5,A real page-turner,"School and homework is over for every student except for Mrs. Zollar's students. She has given them an assignment, to write a journal over hte summer and hand it in to their new English teacher at the begining of the year.Mary-Lou Finney was in Mrs.Zollar's class. She now has to write in a journal about what's been happening with her family and friends each day of the summer. She writes some pretty interestig stuff about her cousin, Carl Ray, and her crush, Alex Cheevey.Mary Lou goes through at least 10 journals through out the whole summer. When she re-reads some of her entries, she relizes that she doesn't want her new English teacher to read her journals.Find out for your self what happens between Mary Lou and Alex and find out the mystery behind her cousin, Carl Ray."
1,Rubbish,"Swiffer WetJet Spray, Mop Floor Cleaner Starter Kit (Packaging May Vary)Please do not waste your money. I have bought 2 of these and neither one has worked. I thought that the 1st one was just a fluke but when the mechanism on the second one would not spray I was annoyed to say the least. Unfortunately because I was so confident in the swiffer product I threw away the receipts. So now I am stuck with 2 useeless wetjets. I have contacted the agents and even that was difficult, so I wait to hear their response."
1,Doesn't deserve 1 star,"In the time it took me to remove all the tape and crap from this thing, I could have cleaned the room with my traditional mop. $35 and 15 minutes of set up time later, no spray or fluid came out of the ""wet jet"" system. This product is a waste of time, money, and plastic. Use an old school mop instead. Swiffer Wet Jet is not ready for prime time in my household."
1,Hire some engineers!,"The wet jet is a great idea! But more than a good idea is needed. It needs to be tested and tweaked until it actually works. It needs to be made of excellent materials that last. AND, most importantly, it needs to be safe for the environment as noted by other reviewers.I wonder if manufacturers ever read these reviews?"
1,Bad for the Enviroment & a Waste of your Money,"This is a horrible tool and I wouldn't recommend it. It requires four batteries to operate, pads that you have to keep replacing, and you have to buy their cleaner. All VERY EXPENSIVE AND HORRIBLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. DON'T BUY IT!PLUS, IT'S JUST EASIER TO CLEAN THE FLOOR WITH A MOP AND GETS THE JOB DONE BETTER."
2,Handle will break in 1 year or less,"Otherwise it is a good product = BUT. Purchased this Swiffer Jet about a year ago. The plastic handle broke at the weak point. I glued mine back together, and then it broke again. Then I glued it back together agian, and splinted the handle with a bent spoon taped to the handle. It is now stronger than original. Swiffer makes these to break, so they can sell more. Call their customer service # for a coupon or replacement, but it will break again. So go ahead and splint the handle when new, to prevent it from breaking later. Otherwise it is a good product."
2,Creates more waists than its cleans...,"I bought the product in hopes of that it would do better than the regular Swiffer mop. Here is my pros & cons:Pros: It has the best scrubbing pads I've seen. Better than the regular mop.and that is it...Cons: 1.) The scrubbing pads are not reusable. So if you use it for a small job, you would need to use a new pad for another cleaning job. 2.) The device only uses ALKALINE Batteries and WILL NOT use any kind of rechargable batteries. 3.) You need to be carefull with the spray trigger. When I handle it and keep mistakenly push the button for the liquid cleaning solution to shoot out.With throwing away those big cleaning pads and 4 AA batteries, the Swiffer Wet Jet creates more waste than it cleans. They need to remake the item with reusable/washable cleaning pads and either the ability to use rechargable batteries or have a built in rechargeable battery to charge with an adapter or charging dock."
4,works great!,"The swiffer works great cleaning floors. I wish the handle was a bit sturdier. I broke my first one by pressing too hard. It works great for quick clean ups or spills too. The refills can get pricey, but all in all, they are worth it. No need to get your hands wet or spred around the dirt as you would with a regular mop and bucket. For deep cleaning, I prefer my floormate, but can't get into small areas. Swiffer is the best for tight spaces. The swivel head is nice too."
4,Swifer Fan,"I am a fan of the Swifer. It is easy to store, easy to use. The handle is a bit flimsy but I have called swifer and gotten a replacement 2 times for the original one I bought...for free. Tossing the pads after each use is a waste and I wish you could refill the solution bottles but I guess convenience always comes at a price so we have to purchase replacements. I tried to refill the bottle with regular floor cleaner and it was really messy and the bottle leaked a little once I put back in unit so refilling was not really an option. I still use it on my tile and linoleum but not on my hardwood. The Bona leaves a better finish on the hardwoods."
3,Too many accents needed!,"I like the product, don't get me wrong. It gets the job done, especially for my room. I just don't like the fact that you have to buy batteries..pads...cleaning liquid...When will buying more ""swiffer"" products end? So I was on a budget and didn't really think mopping would be a resolution for a small room. I figured it'll just get things more messy so I settled for this. It's convenient because you can take it apart and store it in the corner. It's light enough to carry around from room to room. It leaves the floor feeling clean and smelling great.The problems I faced? If there's too much dust, it'll push the dirt around. Also, I have long and thick hair, doesn't really help me pick that up. I would suggest you to go really easy on the spray because it streaks."
4,"Great, but older model was best","My only complain with this new model is that the spayer for the solution doesn't spray as wide as the older model, forcing me to use more solution every time I clean. Thank God that I figured out that you can take the top off of the solution container, and fill it with whatever cleaner you would like. You can find this info online. I use plain - old water and white vinegar. It works just as well as the swiffer solution, but costs much less. And the smell of the vinegar goes away when it dries."
3,Better use that ol trusty mop!,"I decided to buy this product back in 07 or 08 when I went to my sister's home and seen she had one. It's an ok product; I hated how it left residue when cleaning. And I also realized that the Swiffer all in one are better for minor spills and light stains because there have been several occasions where I break sweats trying to remove stains from the ground. On the positive side, I truly had a 5 to 15 min workout with it, and finally it broke on me after a year using the product. I recently bought another one two weeks ago for immediate replacement. After I'm through with the wet jet, I sometimes feel that the floors should be shinny. However, it dries like right after 60 seconds. Let's just be honest, it's best to rely on the trusty old mop to get the job done follow by a floor glow/shine product."
2,Ordered in sept 7th 2011 and its not working today!,"It just stopped working, out of the blue today!! I plan on contacting amazon , because i buy a lot from them, so i hope theyll be able to do something for me!"
2,Avoid,"Not sure what everyone raves about. It's ""easy"" but does a terrible job of actually cleaning the floors. Expensive solution runs out after two or three go arounds.The ""razor and blades"" model is way more expensive than just buying a traditional mop."
1,Over priced and over rated,"I recently purchased the Swiffer Wet Jet starter kit and have been less than satisfied. The best thing I can say is that it has a light weight aluminum shaft. On the other hand here is a list of problems I have had after 2 uses.1. Solution and cleaning pads didn't last long enough to finish my floors.2. The trigger should be on the bottom instead of the top. I can't tell you how many times I sprayed the wall not meaning to.3. The price is too high for such a disposable product.4. The multi purpose cleaner left my hardwood floors with a haze over them and my tile floors were rather sticky.For the $20 I spent I feel like I have to keep using it, and now I have buyers remorse that I didn't just buy a different mop. Maybe it works great on linoleum floors, but I don't have any in my house."
2,Not spectacular,"Nothing spectacular. Didn't remove any stains or nothing, just water with a caustic smell. The smell from the liquid is horrible! The two stars I gave are simply for the cleaning pad."
1,Latest design apparently defective.,"I had purchased an original Swiffer Wet Jet some years ago and (after learning how to refill the bottle myself) used it regularly. When it finally broke recently, I ordered this starter kit from Amazon.com, and discovered that the design had changed, with some apparent improvements. Unfortunately, the new design also brought with it a defect, namely a tendency for the housing around the screw connecting the handle and head to crack. This happened both with my original Wet Jet that I purchased in April 2011, and the replacement unit graciously sent to me at no cost by Amazon in May, both times after minimal use and without any external cause. For now, my Wet Jet sits idle and usuable with a loose and floppy mop head, and the carton of replacement pads was a complete waste of money."
2,"Sorry, not as good as a mop","When I bought this I had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster. It doesn't cut it for a few reasons:1. Solution left a streaky, dull floor. Mop & Glo with water works MUCH better.2. Bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen.3. Need to put batteries in the device (something I didn't realize when I bought it).4. Not ""cleaner than a mop."" If you have a heavy-traffic floor like I do, you'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around. A mop at least can be rinsed.5. Bottle is impossible to refill. I might have stuck with it if I could have replaced the solution with a water/Mop & Glo mix, but they have the bottle fixed so you can't.*sigh* I'm actually considering spending the $$$ for a ""Scooba."" We have a Roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream. If you want something fast, stick with ""Swiffer Wet."" No batteries, no solution to refill."
2,convenient but needs improvement,"While this system is very convenient and gets me to clean the floor much more often than before I had it, there are many things about it that I find frustrating. The smell of the cleanser is so horrible, I feel like I'm going to pass out each time I mop, and it lingers, even the time I left the window open (in the freezing cold weather!) Also, the fluid is supposed to last 2-3 months under ""normal"" usage. Well, I ran out way sooner than that and I don't think I was using it an excessive amount. I keep looking for an indicator that tells you how much cleanser remains, but I don't think one exists, so I was taken by surprise when I ran out. This system is also expensive in the long run, since you have to keep buying new pads and cleansing fluid. I am considering buying the Hoover FloorMate, which I have heard is terrific. Although it's much more expensive, I think overall it will be more economical."
5,Trying to boost the rating,"This product is wonderful! So much so that I have personally bought one for my dad and my husband's dad! This makes my life so easy. I have 3 kids under 6yrs old and a minor OCD about cleanliness... So in combination with my Dyson handheld vac and the swiffer wetjet, my kitchen is cleaned daily! I love it so much that I actually might shell out another $20 to get the newer model! (mine is about 3yrs old, still works perfectly... the new one has two sprayers on the front which is cool!)MAYBE a washable pad option could be nice... but I don't wash anything with bleach and hot water, so I don't see that working for me. I like the new pad for each clean... (and personally, if the pad isn't grossly dirty... I leave it on!)"
1,Utterly useless,"Never have I been more frustrated by cleaning experience than after I used the Swiffer Wet Jet for the first (and only) time. I've has good luck with the regular swiffer, and thought I'd give this a try...Using velcro strips to attach the pad is the main issue here: I could not get the pads to stay attached. The tiny strips of the pad that are meant to contact the velcro are too skinny to ensure decent attachment (seriously, the pad was detaching after about 10 seconds of cleaning)... but if you pull off any of the extra plastic backing to allow for the better connection, the whole thing starts to fall apart.I'd recommend the regular Swiffer without hesitation, but I'd much rather use a rag on my hands and knees than the Wet Jet again. Now to see how much run-around I get for their much touted money-back guarantee. Because I'll be using that.Really: avoid this."
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this,"I bought this product, not knowing that it needed batteries and also that you have to use their cleaning product because the bottles aren't refillable. I saw another poster say that you can screw off the cap with pliers and put in your own fluid, and purchase a reusable pad that will stick to the bottom, but why would I want to go to that trouble? I'm taking it right back. Rubbermaid has a spray mop on Amazon for a few bucks more that uses reusable pads and a spray bottle that you can mix your own cleaner in and doesn't use batteries. Why in the world would it need batteries to squirt fluid anyway, when there are spray mechanisms that don't require batteries? I don't know but this is a waste of money in my opinion."
3,There are better options,"I love the convenience of the Swiffer Wet Jet, but I don't like having to purchase cleaning solution refills and pads. There are ways to modify it to be more sustainable, but after 1 year, mine stopped spraying so it's getting tossed. I replaced it with a Rubbermaid Reveal Mop which comes with 3 reusable mop pads and two bottles which you can fill with your own cleaning solution. Plus, it doesn't rely on a battery operated mechanism to spray the cleaning solution, so I can count on it to continue working for a long time."
4,been using mine for about 6 months,"I have been using mine for about 6 months. I love how convenient it is, always ready to go, no extra cleaners, mop, or sponge required. Does a pretty good job and smells great. It doesn't feel real heavy duty, but if it breaks I will definitely update this review. I wish it didn't require batteries."
1,Do Not Buy,I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy. Product comes without any directions. Had to google for instructions to replace batteries. Batteries go dead very quickly. All in all this product is not consumer friendly and is not worth the money to continue buying solution and cleaning pads.
1,This Mop is a Flop!,"I thought this Swiffer Wet Jet Mop would be better than my old Clorox mop. Wrong! After using it twice, the battery and cover fell out. I found out that my neighbor has the same trouble with hers, so it's not just me. I've worked on this thing so many times that I've finally decided to go and get another Clorox mop. It's better than this piece of junk! Another thing....the Swiffer cleaner is very strong. So it literally stinks in more ways than one! If I could give this product a zero rating... I would.Save yourself the frustration and the money."
4,It is worth the convenience!!,"I bought this product last weekend and tried it last night and loved it! It beats having to drag a bucketful of water around!!! I have read quite a few reviews on this product and usually the ones who gave it a bad score seemed to skip the part where you have to sweep the floor FIRST!! I don't mind sweeping so doing that first and then using Swiffer Wetjet has made my life easier! My kitchen smelled so clean after using it! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the replacement products seem to be a bit pricey. Also, if I have a huge spill (which rarely happens), I would use a regular mop for that. But for my normal mopping, I plan on using SWJ."
2,Convenient but at what cost?,Swiffer WetJet works well at small spots and dirt and is faster to use than mopping but it doesn't do a whole floor clean very well unless you use a lot of fluid and multiple pads. I'm not a tree hugger but after going through 5 pads in a month I had to wonder if only 1 million Swiffer WetJets are out there - what do 5 million Swiffer pads look like in landfills in a month (or 60 Million in a year) and how long will they stay there for my 10 minutes of convenience? I've heard there are washable pad versions out there - will have to find one.
1,PADS FOR CLEANING NO GOOD,"I BOUGHT ONE. PADS GET FILTHY AFTER A FEW STROKES ON A DIRTY FLOOR AND THEN CONTINUE TO SPREAD THE FILTH. TV ADS NEVER SHOW A DIRTY PAD. ALL PAD MOPS WILL BE JUST AS USELESS. IN MY OPINION, THIS PRODUCT WAS DESIGNED FOR USE ON CLEAN TV FLOORS OR TO SELL REPLACEMENT PADS.BOTTOM LINE- PADS SPREAD DIRT, NOT CAPTURE IT."
3,It leaks,The Swiffer does clean the floor very well. The problem is that liquid is all over. When you are through the pad(s) are still soaking and drip. When you remove the tank there is still liquid in the appliance and leaks.They need better control of the liquid solution.
1,Bad,"I thought this would be good for daily use when I don't need my steam mop (which I love), but I was wrong. The location of the button is right at the curve of the handle where you would rest your hand or pick up the swiffer and has lead me to ""swiffer"" my pants, the wall, the side of the fridge, ect. The solution also leave the floor sticky and I don't dare put any pressure on the handle to use the scrubbing pad in the front for fear of the handle snapping (I have also hit the butten then to ""swiffering"" my shoes). It was a waste of money and lesson learned."
1,Swiffer is a worthless piece of junk/,"This is the epitome of ""Cash in the Trash,"" and entirely worthless. The handle is far too short, and it gives me a backache to use it even for a few minutes. The handle is also too narrow, and my hand gets cramped after holding it for a short time. The end, where the pad is held awkwardly in place, flips back and forth, and I spend most of my time trying to keep it in one position. It is a smelly, stinky, wet mess that does a poor job of cleaning, and has to be replaced every few minutes. In looking at this inane ""mop,"" it looks like some goofy elementry school science project that would be laughed at, or, at best, a prototype or ""Beta"" version of a houseware item that would be tried out by a few people and quickly scrapped as rather poorly concieved, badly designed, and inept to use. It is amazing to me that this company goes on selling this junk and that people are wasting their time and money buying and using it."
1,Older wet jet model is made better!,I bought the new wet jet model after using my other one for years. When I got the new model the handle broke within 1 month. I bought another one only to have the handle break in 4 months. Dont bother buying. Get the older model mine still works great.
2,Works until it breaks,"This works well when it works. It's perfect for quick cleanups and gets the majority of the crud off the floor. They're so convenient I don't want to go back to a mop and bucket, but they are very fragile. We've had two break within 6 months just by tipping over. I set the handle up against the wall and it fell over. When I picked it up the spray button didn't work anymore. This happened twice. I would hope they'd be a little more sturdy than that. It's probably just a loose circuit but they're not easy to open up to fix. I guess you can't expect much at this price."
2,So annoying!!!,"I did like this until the pads kept coming off while I was mopping. So I end up on my hands and knees scrubbing with the stupid pad so I don't waste the pad and soultion in it. Would be great if they would stay on, love the concept, good for everyday cleaning not deep down mopping."
2,Smell Overpowering,"Swiffer WetJet is very handy for quick cleaning. A regular mop is needed occasionally to deep clean.However, we are discontinuing use in our house due to the incredibly overpowering smell of the cleaning solution. We use minimal, and I mean, MINIMAL amounts of the solution otherwise we end up needing to air out the house. What is the point then?? We will be trying out the METHOD system next."
1,Be prepared to replace it,It works great at first. I have had three of them in the last year. After a while it snaps in half. You have to use a little pressure on dried food spills and eventually it will break in two. I am not planning on buying a fourth one. I will maybe look into a steam cleaner.
2,worked fine until it broke,"Was able to use it for about a month before the mop broke, probably from applying pressure and scrubbing. The design is flawed."
1,Multipurpose solution leaves residue,"I like the build of the product, and the pads are the best of any of these types of products I've tried so far. However, the multipurpose cleaning solution that came with it leaves a dull residue on the floors. One reviewer said that the gel in the pads can leave the residue, but these were all new pads and had no tearing. A wipe with a rag after applying the solution proved it wasn't the pads leaving the residue. A few minutes of using it left me with 45 minutes of getting this stuff off my floors! I have many types of flooring in my house, with two different types of laminated wood and various tile. All showed residue and dulling. A horrible cleaning solution for floors. I'm going to try one of the other solutions. If none of the others work, then this product goes in the trash. I'll update on the other solutions as I try them.In short, DO NOT use the multipurpose solution on your floors."
3,convenient... but have moved on,"When I first got this I loved it, was excited about it. I hate mopping and found this to be very convenient. So if you are extremely busy this could be a great solution for you. But I have since found an alternative that is better for me-- and my lazy mopping attitude.First off, I have a steam mop which I use once a month on all my hardwood floors. But I could skip that step completely. I have bought a regular mop with a microfiber pad (I chose the scotch-brite hardwood mop... but use it on tile/linoleum with no problems). It looks much like the original swiffer but with a wider head. I have a spray bottle I fill with a vinegar solution. You can see where I'm going, right? Spray it ahead of me (much like the wetjet does) and then follow with my mop.It is much more cost effective than the wetjet and I can use whatever floor cleaner I want... in the bathrooms upstairs I use bleach solution. But I stole the idea from the wetjet!"
3,average product,"Wouldn't put this product on a pedestal, does the job, but if you have pets that shed, better make sure your floors are WELL swept before doing your floors with this. Over priced product."
3,"Smells funky, but very convenient","I'm not a huge fan of the smell of this Swiffer solution that comes with the sweeper, but the sheer convenience of this product keeps me coming back to it.It's just so nice to grab it and start swiffering. It's also a plus not having to dip the thing back and forth in the water and squeeze it out. It's just fast and easy. I know that makes me sound terribly lazy, but I mean, who really likes cleaning? It's a pain.I give this three stars because of convenience and because I do feel like it gets my tile clean (I have very limited tile in my apartment -- it's only in the kitchen and the bathroom). It falls short of the final two stars because, as others have said, the solution doesn't smell very good. I miss the smell of my lavender scented cleaner that I normally mop with. In addition, you do have to use their solution and I believe you have to use their pads too, although I'm sure others would work fine."
4,Love the convenience,This is so much better than a mop and bucket. I don't mind paying for the refills. The Febreeze scented cleaner smells so good. This makes cleaning up quick!
2,Buy a steam mop!,I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It uses chemicals to clean and you have to keep buying swifter pads to fit the mop as well as the chemical cleaner. I'm ditching this and getting a steam mop!
3,Why do you need batteries?,"You need batteries to control the spray mechanism, and you can only use their own Swiffer solution...that's how they get ya. Works for what it's intended though. The Swiffer mop with the wet sheets is better."
3,flimsey,"I gave it 3 stars because I do love the mop. It's a miracle. But, it fell apart in 6 mths. And not under heavy use. I will replace it, but with another brand."
2,too much like perfume,"While I loved the concept, the smell is overpowering and cloyingly sweet. My first use left streaks over my laminate floors and I had to go back over the floor with Pergo cleaner and dry swiffer. If they would just make ""unscented laminate cleaner"" to use on those floors, it would be rated better."
3,Time to move on.,"After several years of using Swiffer mops I am finally moving on. These are a good ""in-between"" mop - by that I mean they are better and more convenient than a standard mop, but they're not in the same league as something like a steam mop. I found this out after trying a steam mop - the Eureka Enviro Steamer - last week for the first time. I was amazed at how easy it was to use and how great it cleaned -and- sanitized, which is why I'm finally ditching the Swiffer. Between cleaning solution and disposable cleaning pads, neither of which are necessary for the steam mop, I'm looking at saving between $50 - $100 over the course of a year. Kind of makes me wish I had gone this route sooner, but better late than never. Swiffer is good for what it is, but if you can afford to shell out a little more up front, you will end up saving money in the long run."
2,Sprayer keeps dying out,"I had a swiffer when they first came out, back then they were great! However I just bought mine last month and it only worked great the 1st time. After that the sprayer keeps dying out when i'm using it, i've tried changing the batteries, i've tried using rechargable batteries, nothing seems to help. It lasts for about 2 minutes then it stops working.It seems to me that it's just too much trouble. The refills are expensive, and the frustration from trying to get it work is not worth it.."
5,swiffer wet jet,My granddaughter loved the wet jet swiffer I had at my house. She couldn't think of anything she really wanted for her birthday so I ordered a wet jet for her and she was thrilled. She just turned 9. Think what a wonder she will be at 19!!
1,swiffer wet jet,"I just purchased this swiffer wet jet starter kit and could not wait to use it. While it did work well at cleaning the floor, the odor was so strong I had to open all the windows and take the solution bottle out of the unit and throw it away. I guess I will be donating this to someone; unless I can find a solution that does not smell. Still have headache :-("
1,Doesn't work,"I can't stand this mop. I have used it for a quick clean up and the whole house and everytime, even with a brand new pad on, it leaves my floors sticky. I am surprised Swiffer still sells this product. Have they not tested it? Don't buy it! All you need is a mop, hot water and vinegar and it does the job great."
2,All-in-one??? Maybe if it did more...,"Those silly marketing guys... ""all-in-one""1. Sprays a wonderful smelling liquid that leaves streaks on dark tiles.2. Pushes dirt around requiring you to vacuum or sweep first3. Pads are one time use and it would be cheaper and greener if they were washable.4. Pads are pretty pricey5. The solution smells good.6. Mops floors (but not as good as a traditional mop)That's 6 things in one!!!!!!!!!! That's an all-in-one!!!!Once I returned it to Wally World (Wal-mart for those who haven't heard of the Wally), I purchased the Bissell flip-ease. A little more pricey, but it vacuums on one side, sprays fluid on the other and has absorbant microfiber pads that are washable/reusable. Check out my other post on that one.http://www.amazon.com/review/R10L8XK1PMEGN6/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"
2,"okay, but not green","The Swiffer is fine for quick spot cleaning on hardwood and tile floors; the disposable pads pick up a lot of dirt even after the floor has been thoroughly swept. HOWEVER, the pads are like disposable diapers, and one pad will barely clean one room, so you end up using several. They and the solution are expensive, and I especially don't like adding mounds of plastic-backed, non-biodegradable pads to the landfills. All-in-all, it's handy, but I'd much prefer re-useable pads that could be washed and used many times. As for the pricey solution, I'll try the suggestions that others have made about making my own and prying off the top of the container."
3,1.Recent change to pads and 2. Make your own solution,1.Recently I have noticed a change in the pads. I don't have any of the old ones to compare but I am sure the newer ones are less effective in cleaning and get saturated with dirt much faster. I do not like them.2. I found by simply using a channel lock pliers or vice grips you can easily remove the cap on the bottles of cleaning solution and pour your own mix in the twist the cap back on. Cake and Pie. I use about a half cup vinegar and fill the rest of the way up with distilled water to prevent mineral deposits which could cause streaking.Now if I could find a good replacement for the pads which is cheaper +/or does a better job I would be happy.
1,"aluminum handle broke within 2 months, replaced, then plastic handle broke after 3 more months","This is a poor product. Upon light use (about 3 times a week for a kitchen floors),- aluminum handle broke within 2 months,- Amazon replaced it (great service from Amazon),- then, plastic handle broke after 3 more monthsthe plastic waste generated by having to replace it every 2 to 3 months should be a shame for P&g; and an incentive to get better products out.I would replace it and not waste my time writing this review, but I don't want to pay P&g; for another POS and to encourage them with these practices."
1,Looking to waste money on a poor product? Swiffer has you covered!,I mistakenly bought this product hoping to decrease my mop time seeing as how no bucket would be needed and I wouldn't have to wring out the mop x amount of times in the process. While I didn't need to wring out the mop or fill and empty a bucket I found that the cleaning experience of the Swiffer was disastrous and the exact opposite of what is advertised. It picked up considerably less than a regular mop to the point that I had to use paper towels to clean up the excess after going through two Velcro pads prior to. The cleaning solution smells really bad so thankfully I have a bathroom with a window and with that and the aid of a oscillating fan I was able to remove the sent within a half an hour. I recommend that you opt for another product or just stick with the old bucket mops because after you have tried this that is exactly what you are going to do anyway.
2,All of the wet jet products aren't worth the money,"Rated this the same as the cleaner and the cleaning pads. My wife doesn't like them, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
4,Mostly effective,"It's good to clean one or two messes, but not resistent enough to clean the entire floor at once. If you have ANY amount of dust on your floor, do not spray the cleaning liquid or you'll end up just pushing wet dust around your floor"
3,Swiffer WeJet,"Ok product but doesn't clean as well as I would hope, but it get the job done. I wished it did a better job at corners."
3,Easy and convenient but they break constantly,"I go through one mop (not just the pads and the cleaning solution...the mop itself) every 9-10 months. The thin aluminum joint right in the middle of the mop, where the two pieces come together about two feet off the ground, is extremely weak and breaks regularly with very little pressure. Once broken, the mop is rendered garbage...it cannot be repaired. I always buy a new one because I love it and it's insanely convenient, but it has that one fatal design flaw that compels me to give it three stars instead of five. As soon as I find something equally convenient, I'll be replacing the Swiffer Wet Jet for good."
1,"Flawed design, I'm giving up mine","Use the power-less Swiffer w/ wet wipes instead if you must. This one has a lot of design flaws:1) It leaks (let it be upright or downright) over time.2) Its solution is both expensive & too toxic (strong & artificial).3) Its pad does NOT pick up too much dirt, seems to be saturated all too soon & prematurely.4) Its scratch pad seems to be too weak to scrape off settled dirt even w/ the help of your feet like its manual suggests.5) Its spray is all over the places, including your wall.Only good thing is that its nozzle hasn't clogged over time."
1,huh?,"If you want convenience for small spills try the following. Mix vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Keep it under your sink. When your floor has a spill, spray and wipe with a paper towel. You can move the paper towel with your foot and only bend down to pick up the paper towel. I have cats, kids and an active kitchen life. This has kept the dirt under control when the swiffer failed to meet the task."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I own a Swiffer Wet Jet, and I am sorry I wasted my money. I don't know how effective this is on other surfaces, but I use it for my Brazilian Chestnut Hardwood Floors. Along with the cleaning solution that Swiffer markets for Hardwood. I use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $40,000 come up with smears and smudges like you wouldn't believe. I realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors, but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions, it really isn't all that inexpensive the ONLY thing this product has gong for it is it's convienence, and technically, since I have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges, it really isn't that convienient either. So really this product is a BIG DUD for Hardwood floors at least."
3,BYOB -- bring your own batteries,"My old Wet Jet was falling apart, but I liked how easy it was to use. Guess it's been a long time since I bought one. How foolish I was to think that they would include batteries with their battery-operated device. I decided that's the last time I buy a swiffer product. Too bad, but after paying $22 for this, PLUS another nearly $20 for pads and the liquid cleaner, they've soaked me for enough."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought the item and it was ok. Then all of the sudden the pump mechanism ceased to work after only a couple of mops. Even with the pump working it fail to remove basic grim off the floor. I would rather use a toothbrush even though is harder, tougher, and longer but what swiffer has only showed me that it's better to use a little elbow grease than it's products.There is nothing swiff about this swiffer."
4,Great but handle could be more durable,I bought my first Swiffer WetJet Spray several years ago and it works great. I use it once a week. I haven't had the sprayer jam up on me. The handle can be more durable. I had to use electrical tape to keep it together after quite some time of using this. I would say a year if not longer. I needed to replace it recently and went to the store to pick one up. They didn't have this exact model and it only lasted me about two months before falling apart. TO replace the new one I came to Amazon to make sure I would have the product I wanted. You can't beat the price for the amount of usage I get from it.
1,If you like this wetjet...be prepared to buy a new one every 6 months,"This product is pretty good for a quick cleanup and I find that the pads actually remove a lot of dirt. However, this darn product keeps breaking in half (at the point where the handle connects to the rest of the pole). It is so annoying!I have now bought a similar Mr. Clean mop which has a much sturdier pole since the spray is generated by trigger action not by battery power. Therefore, no wires need to run through the poles.I wonder how many swiffer wetjets are lying around in garbage dumps with broken handles...what a waste! It is a shame because you can't even post a review at the swiffer wetjet web site."
3,"Only good for light, small cleaning.","I wanted to get this Wet Jet because I hated having to go wet the mop in the bucket and back and forth. I tried the Wet Jet to clean my whole house and it was fast cleaning, but not so great. It didn't clean my floors that great, and the scent of the cleaning product was a bit too strong. I think this is a waste of money to have to keep buying the cleaning products plus the pads for the Wet Jet. I do like the Wet Jet only for fast and small cleaning areas like after cooking in my kitchen or the bathrooms. I will be replacing my Wet Jet with another mop. I will be returning the Wet Jet back to the store. I got the Sh-Mop now and it's AWESOME!! My review for the Sh-mop is there."
4,Really good! Fast and effective!!,"I love this mop! I'm the kind of person who hates mopping floors. It is usually so hard, but this little baby makes things so much easier. Yes, you have to use a broom first, but you always have to do this before you mop anyways! The only downside to me is the smell. It smells good and clean, but it is kind of strong."
2,Good for pushing dirt around...,"This product is very disappointing. It claims to ""attract the dirt your mop can push around."" What a joke! Unless you sweep every last crumb or speck of dirt before using it, it just pushes loose dirt around, so you have to sweep AGAIN after using it. Which means THREE passes of your floor: sweep, Swiffer, sweep. It makes your floor SMELL clean and does clean some superficial dirt, but is definitely not an adequate replacement for a mop! Even if you put the pad directly on top of a speck of dirt, it will not stay on the pad. Don't waste your money!"
4,"Not perfect, but more than useful","It didn't seem possible that the Swiffer Wet Jet could work as well as the commercials. It doesn't. It's useful, though. Although I use the Swiffer Max, Swiffer Wet, and the Swiffer Wet Jet, I still find it necessary to use the dutch broom and the sponge mop every week or so to get the floor really clean."
2,How to turn Wet Jet into a 5 stars product,I hate its cleaning pads and un-refill-able cleaner bottles. I came to find a perfect way to use Wet Jet. I use swiffer wet mopping cloths rather than the pads. The mopping cloths can well stick to the Wet Jet. Then I used a craft knife to make a small hole on a emtpy cleaner bottle. The hole is on the side near the bottom. This position can keep water from spilling out of the bottle when you use the Wet Jet. When I want to use the Wet Jet I will fill about 1 fifth of water in the bottle and empty the water when I am done. I think I can also make most of the wet moping cloths this way. The result is perfect. Try this method and I think you will love it.
2,"Waste of money - amendment (additional tips, see below)","Yes, it's convenient but you have to commit yourself to buying the pads and solution which in the long run could be filthy expensive! Burden off my shoulders whn I finally managed to return this to the store. Decided to get something from Gaiam, where you can use your own cleaning solution and comes with microtech cleaning cloth which you could just toss in the washer after each use!** Ok, so I changed my mind after I finally found what I was actually looking for. Love this thing loads and it's cheaper too! It's Leifheit Mr. Mister. Not sure if Amazon carries this product but you could go to Leifheit's website. Great customer service too. On the drop down menu, it shows delivery to APO/AE address but it somehow would not allow me to place the order but just give them a call and they'll sort it out for you. Sorry Amazon but we still love you loads!"
1,Not a happy camper with this product!,"I used the Swiffer on my wood flooring with the solution made especially for hardwood floors. It did not clean as promised, but left a dull streaky film all over the floor. Don't waste your money on this product. I can't believe that Good Housekeeping recommends this."
1,Can't get it to work!,"I put it together and it doesn't squirt--tried new batteries, still no luck--very sad for me and my kitchen floor :-("
1,NEW Swiffer Wetjet is a piece of crap!,I have used the Swiffer Wetjet sooo long it was time for a new one for myself and leave the old Wetjet for the restrooms upstairs. I use the Wetjet mostly downstairs so I wanted another with the new strip across the front since the scrubber was worn out on my old one which is in otherwise good condition.Well! The new one is sooo freaking cheaply made that the handle started coming apart while mopping after the first week! I am sooo disappointed. (That also happened with my Clorax mop. The original was well made and the next 3 yes 3 were so poorly made that I gave up and switched to the Wetjet.) That makes me mad that they gain your confidence and then switch out to cheaper products so they can make a killer profit from gaining the consumers trust and then f---ing them over when they repurchase those items. I WILL be calling the Swiffer company tomorrow!
1,"Dull, streaky floors","I bought the swiffer wet jet to clean my laminate floors and it left them a dull, streaky mess. Now I have to clean them all over again. The wet jet will go right out in the trash...what a waste of money!"
2,It Leaks All Over the Floors I Just Mopped!,"I've owned the Wet Jet for about 3 years and had no problems. In fact, I was quite the fan. The handle on my old wet jet broke, but after 3 years of constant use, I didn't hesitate to go buy another one. This model has the double spray feature. Whenever I pick up the mop to transport to another room, or to simply put away, it leaks the cleaning solution (I'm assuming whatever has been left over from spraying settels in and then leaks when the mop is picked back up)all over the floors I just cleaned! And I'm not talking about just a drop or two. I then have to grab a towel and get down on my hands an knees to wipe up the mess. This wastes cleaning solution and creates more work. My kids already make enough mess after I clean. I certainly don't want to pay for a product that does the same thing!"
2,Just another gadget headed for the recycle bin,"I have used this Swiffer for several months now and do not see any advantage over the standard squeeze mop and bucket method. You still have to sweep or vacuum up any debris that the pad doesn't pick up; and you still have to wipe around the corners and edges on the floor where most mops do not do a good job. The cleaning solution leaves a nice fragrance after you have cleaned; but that does not justify the expense, and I have gone back to using my regular mop. The solution and pads are an extra expense, which I do not believe is warranted for the value this device adds to the floor cleaning process. You also have to change the pads frequently. It is easier and less expensive to empty a bucket and you don't have to replace batteries."
3,Swiffer. A method for applying perfume to your floor.,"Whoa, that perfumy smell really stinks. And having just mopped with a mop and bucket last week, I can tell you that the swiffer did NOT do a better job, it did a worse job. Even with more elbow grease than I had to use with the mop.But -- it is nice not to have to haul a bucket around. I think I will use my own cleaning solution."
3,Great for a quick spot fix... but so is a wet wipe.,"Priced high for the value, in my honest opinion. Every time I have used this product with the same brand of floor cleaner, I usually have to mop over it or grab a clorox wipe because it leaves my linoleum sticky and unpleasant to walk on. It was great to have when I was helping raise a puppy with puddle problems, but now I find it mostly useless and simpler to just manually take care of any spills or spots that rise.My parents have one of these, which is why I wanted to try it out - it doesn't seem to have as much of the sticky issue when used on hardwood, but still seems to be more trouble than it's worth."
4,Awesome For Daily Keeping !!,"This is great for light duty floors but not the best for heavy clean-ups. I use it about every other day and it helps keep my floors clean, refreshed and smelling good. It goes great with the Vacumme Sweeper =)"
2,"When it says starter, it means it!",Man the swiffer is nice but they give you this little ass soap bottle and 3 refill pads which wont get you thru the month
2,EATS YOUR MONEY,I like the concept that you dont have to lug around a mop and a bucket.I notice with this mop that I will mop my floor and mop the second time and on the second time I still get a dirty pad. How is that? I thought that you mop once and all the dirt comes off the floor. I have a huge kitchen. 2 pads should do the trick but it does not. I end up using more pads. This mop is expensive but worth it if you dont want to lug around a mop and bucket. I want to keep this mop so in order to keep it I have now tooken a drill and drilled a hole in the top of the solution bottle and have poured pine sol and water into the empty bottle. HA HA Swiffer. You didnt think that I could find a way around your pricy bottles. They just want your money. Thats why they try to make it impossible to refill the bottles with your own cleaner.
2,Neither efficient nor cost effective,"While not expensive to initially purchase, this system IS expensive in the long run. If you mop your floors regularly or have a lot of rooms to mop, you'll be constantly replacing pads and cleaner and batteries, none of which are cheap.Additionally, this system does not clean my laminate floors well. It leaves them cloudy/hazy and they never look or feel 100% clean afterwards. When I go over with a damp paper towel where I just mopped, it always shows a fair amount of dirt. And looking at the pad when you remove it from the mop you can see why. The way it is designed, the most pressure is on the front edge of the mop. The center and back of the pad don't receive nearly as much pressure and pick up almost nothing.In short, for small jobs and irregular cleaning, this mop will do. Otherwise, it is inefficient, expensive and ultimately frustrating."
3,I prefer the old swiffer version,I love the swiffer but the old version of it is better.In this new version the water spray from the side when in the old version the water spray from the center.
3,somewhat fragile,"We've had one of these for about two yeas before the plastic universal joint that connects the pad holder to the handle disintegrated. Now the pad is held on solely by the fluid hose, so we are ordering a new one. I guess this is not bad for the price, but I wish the joint was stronger."
1,Dont last long,I bought a wetjet about 10 years ago that one only lasted about 3 month till the sprayer stoped working Now i have new floors so I thought I would try it again So I bought another one to try but now i am on my first bottel and the spayer quit working again I give up I liked the way it cleaned my floors but I will not keep buing them
1,Doesn't work,Does not work. Called 1-800-742-9220 they will send me a coupon to buy another one - this will take 2-3 weeks.They should have sent a replacement.Should be a zero star
3,Cleans floor but not worth the money,I had used my friends swiffer wet jet and wanted to buy my own but first you have to buy batteries for the mop??? Then the antibacterial refills cost around 7$. They do give you a few coupons but I only got it cos it seemed cheap and easy to use...WRONG!!!!
1,Do not get if you are chemically sensitve!,"I bought this because I'm pregnant and looking for an easier solution to doing my floors. I thought I'd try swiffer and thought this sounded good. Unfortuanately, the chemcal solution smells so bad that it contaminated the entire box, extra pads and all and wasn't even open. The bottle is not the kind you can open, empty and refill with your own stuff and you can't fit another bottle into the holder. They really designed this to get the most amount of money out of you...you HAVE to use their products unless you want to do a lot of work to rig it up which I did not find it was worth. I only had this in my house a short time (20 minutes) and it took me hours to get that smell out of the house! ...and I didn't even open the bottle or break the seal. This went straight to the dump. I wouldn't inflict those strong, highly unnecessary chemicals on anyone! At least they could have made it so we could use our own cleaning solutions."
5,Simple effective,"Cheap, easy to use, and feels sturdy enough to last. Worth more than what I paid IMO."
2,Snooze Fest.,"Ok, I a not a teacher/lawyer......but I am educated. I found this book very hard to read----big words/scientific data and so forth. It just was a big snooze for me. I can't get thru it without wishing he'd just get to the point...keep it simple I always say!"
2,Happy Birthday!,"Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday Dear,__________ Happy Birthday to you!"
5,NIce Book!,Nice Book for the money. Very informative and the images are verygood. This guy is quite the traveller.
5,Inspiring Read!,"I highly enjoyed this book and wish it would be read by all parents. Sadly, the ones who need it the most will be the least likely to pick it up. We live in a time when most people are demanding more schooling, more structure. This book says exactly what I feel, only much more eloquently. Kids who aren't connected to the environment certainly won't grow up to respect and love the Earth. Kids need to have time to ""work"" beside their parents. They need time for unstructured play. And most of all, they need time outside to learn about and love nature and the outdoors."
5,GREAT READ!,"I've read Oren's bestselling nonfiction, SIX DAYS OF WAR, and found his fiction debut, REUNION, just as informative and even more entertaining. Filled with detail of WWII battle and how it changes the lives of soldiers forever, the return of one combat unit to the site that changed their lives 50 years later is powerful, complex, and inspiring. And there's a mystery inside to boot! If you like military fiction you'll love this!"
4,Thrilling reunion,"Reunion is a good story about a meeting of old WWII Battle of the Bulge veterans, in a city where they fought.It shows flashes of their lives, after the war, and mixes it with action during the battle, and in the aftermath.It's a book about people, but there is also a mistery story that develops along the meeting.I recommend the reading."
4,Impressive first novel,"Ambassador Oren has written an impressive first novel. He manages to weave the mystery of the reunion with the horrors of warfare and the facts of WW2. The reader is taken to Belgium during the ""Battle of The Bulge."" The different personalities and the intrigue of the story provide an engrossing read.Kudo's to the author. I look forward to his next book."
4,"Good story, good acting, good photography","If you liked ""The Great Escape"" or ""The Colditz Story,"" here's another World War II escape film, made in the UK in 1957. In this film, however, it's a Luftwaffe pilot who escapes from a POW camp in England. Sent to Canada after he is recaptured, he escapes across the frozen St. Lawrence River to the United States.It's a satisfying film. Hardy Kruger well plays the role of Franz von Werra. (You can find out more about von Werra from the Wikipedia article that traces his whole career.) Some of the B&W; photography of the English countryside is wonderfully composed.-30-"
4,A true story about the other side,A very different film in as much as the hero is a shot down German pilot in World War 2 Britain.This pilot actually got away in real life from the prison camp and returned to Germany.A touch of British fair play here.Someone who tried against impossible odds and got away.Almost a shame in real life he was killed in action later in the war.An interesting and engaging film. Worth being in anybodies dvd collection.
2,Dave,A typical world war II propoganda style film being made just prior to our entry into the war and in the same vein as that of the Purple Heart film made right after our surprise bombing of Tokyo. The film is based on a true story of a escaped german wwII prisoner setting his sights on the then nuetral USA. An OK film.
3,Overlapping (& Redundant) Series of Lectures,"My hope was that this series of lectures, which were partially reworked for the text, would present a more cohesive, sequential,less redundant, discourse on the issues. Examples are used, and reused, using identical text, which does nothing to advance or deepen understanding on the issues. Little reference is made to other major experts and their work in the field, except as a means for for highlighting the author's own views, and there is definitely an ego at work here."
2,not enough cooling for my jeep,"I needed a new radiator for my jeep. I bought this one, thinking it was a heavy duty radiator. We live in a hot climate and this one only has about half the number of fins of my current one. I installed this one, but my jeep ran hot, so i put the old one back in until if find a better one."
4,good enough,"I had no trouble adjusting this with my Sram Red levers. The levers provide a trim position coming down from the large ring, but I have never needed to use it in any gear combination. Some credit goes to my extremly stiff, way oversize aluminum frame. Shifting has always been quick without dropping the chain. The basic black is sober but tidy and well finished.The one thing a little upsetting was a serious indentation in my clearcoat when I changed to a smaller front chainring."
2,"hard to adjust, works poorly","This product came on my new bike ,been to two different bike shops they cannot adjust it"
3,close but no cigar,I was really excited to find this book. Although it arrived quickly and in excellent condition I was disapointed once I had opened it. The images are tiny (and have been cropped)and are only of the front of the pattern packet. It is interesting to see such a collection of patterns and designs but they are so small you can't see any details!.
5,Blueprints of Fashion: Home Sewing Patterns of the 1950s,"What a magic book! From the history of commercial patterns to the fantastic quality of the colour photography, the original pattern envelopes just came alive.The wonderful glossy paper quality of the book just enhanced it all."
