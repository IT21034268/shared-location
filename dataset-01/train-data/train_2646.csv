4,An excellent history lesson for young children,"I teach Kindergarten in New York City. My students sat totally engrossed as I read the story of Ruby Bridge's struggle to gain an education in New Orleans, Louisiana.After I finished the story they asked to hear it again. My five year students actually had a sophistated discussion about the moral wrongs of Ruby's experience. To quote one little boy, ""But that's not right. It doesn't matter what someone looks like, they should be able to go to school.""My students totally got it! In January we learned about Martin Luther King, Jr. and they instantly connected the Civil Rights struggle lead by King to Ruby's experience of going to an integrated school. They also learned the value of education. It was an awesome experience.I highly recommend this book to anyone with children or works with children."
5,Planet Trip Hop 2 - Nu Underground,This is an excellent CD. You will find yourself listening to this CD over and over and loving it even more every time you listen to it. This is defiantly a CD to listen to all the way through with out skipping one song.
5,It's Hard To Believe,"It's hard to believe that Robert Rankin's books are so difficult to obtain on these shores: for my money, Rankin is, hands down, one of the funniest, most visionary authors writing in any genre. His style is loose and playful and, on the onset, seemingly completely at odds with the purpose of constructing a coherent narrative. Laugh-out-loud moments abound however, drawing the slack-jwed reader deep into a web of outrageous characters and even more outrageous situations. An absolutely stunning achievement! I wish I could have amnesia so I could read this book again for the first time!"
4,An excellent security reference,"Real World Linux Security, Second Edition, is an excellent security reference. This book has a very broad scope of security, covering more than just hacks and quick fixes. For example it has a section that discusses creating security policies and procedures. These topics sometimes feel like they are not quite on the topic of Linux security, since they fall into more general computer security category. I am of two minds about this. It is nice to have these ideas brought up here because you do not need to purchase a separate book to get some ideas. However you cannot get the same level of detail when you want to cover too many aspects of security in one book.Overall, I found this to be a very good reference. There are certainly other books I'd recommend as supplimental material, butin general this book holds it's own."
5,Excellent Book.,"Easy to follow steps to hardening any Linux based system, a must for system administrators."
4,Excellent Resource,"After reading this book it is clear that Mr. Toxen knows his subject well. Just about every aspect of system security is covered, with real world anecdotes and examples scattered liberally throughout. This book is a must have addition to the library of anyone interested in computer security."
5,"Very thorough, very readable book","I love this book; it covers the subject thoroughly and in a veryreadable way. I might be biased, since I know the author, butwhen I recommend it to friends, they all tell me they like it too.The friends that don't buy their own copy keep borrowingmine from me (it's out on loan even now).I know a fair amount about security issues, and I thoughtabout writing a book like this some years ago (I even spenta few months on preparatory research), but Toxen has done afar better job on the topic than I ever could have."
5,Useful but should have been online,"This book is exactly what its title says. It is for those who want to identify the many security holes and some of the common fixes. Bob Toxen gives very good references on finding other security tools on the web and in the library.A useful feature of the book is a discussion of the lastest security software. The danger however is that this will make the book outdated quite fast. for instance, the author talks about ipchains not iptables. Also he misses references to trusty software such as cryptfs (though there is a reference to ppdd).The book is a must-have as a reference. It would have been more useful if it was available online."
3,"Good, but short on organization","Good book with good tidbits, but poorly organized. I look for more of a flowchart feel, and this had me jumping all around in order to find related items whil etrying to secure my computer. Better than the first edition though. I would prefer less talk and stories and have more ""real world"" solutions."
3,"Good information, poor organization","This book has quite a lot of usefeul info in it, but the organization is terrible. Also, the security points frequently seem like duplicates of previous ones. And the writing style could use a little more editing; the author comes off as a bit too much of a hotshot. Nonetheless, a useful edition to the security-conscious Linux-users bookshelf."
2,A Rambling Tour,"A lengthy, repetitious, rambling tour of almost every aspect of Linux security that you'd care to know about, with occasional instructions on actually how to harden your system, told in a chatty and conciously 'hip' style. Not the kind of thing that appeals to me. For my money, I'd get Robert Ziegler's ""Linux Firewalls."""
3,All credibility lost,"This book was doing OK as a general intro to Linux security. I had differences of opinion here and there, but overall the book was fairly accurate. As a very simple intro book, this is pretty good. If you're looking for any real depth, you're better off with HOWTOs.When Toxen suggested that the most secure Linux distribution was RedHat, I realized he must not have as much experience as he claims. Not even counting the secure distros like Immunix, even sstandard Debian and SuSE distros have enhanced security features and much more sane defaults.That simple statement destroyed any credibility Toxen had managed to build with me. Looking back, I found that my differences of opinion were more substantial than I'd thought. I'm on the lookout for a new Linux security book now."
5,Practical approach,"This book provides a very good approach to security, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. Pragmatism is key for good security. I advise it for any person/organization that want to harden its servers from malicious intentions and make life more complex for crackers (more time spent in cracking the system, more occasions to be detected and more risks)."
3,Not as good as advertized,"I got this book after the glamerous slashdot review. I was saddened to see that it was not as complete as the first edition of hacking linux exposed which I got in 2001. I would have given it two stars based on the book, but the cd does have a lot of tools on it, which bumped it up to 3 stars. But you're still better off with hacking linux exposed. I can only imagine that the 2nd edition of hacking is better than the first, though I don't have it yet."
5,Great for new Linux Users,I am fairly new to the Linux/Unix world.I have found the book to be well written and easy to follow.
5,amazing,i saw this documentary in class. i thought it was amazing. i recommend it to EVERYONE. definetly watch it
5,EXCITING SCIENCE,This DVD is an excellent documentary of the genetic history of human evolution. Settles the question once and for all about where did we all come from? ...Africa!!! And of course proof that we are all related regardless of the colour of our skin. Over time this science will be the great equalizer of the human species. A story I want to share with my children and generations to come.
5,Don't listen to the racists reviewing Spencer Wells' research!,"After more than three years of watching and rewatching Spencer Wells' careful production, discussing it in graduate classes and with friends and relatives both qualified and unqualified, I was shocked to read racist reviews of Journey of Man in Amazon. We are all so closely related that any African child can grow up to be a typical American if brought here, and any American child can learn the skills needed to become a competent African citizen in the same amount of time. Spencer Wells has shown that we are all very much alike and separated from one another by less than 50,000 years, and of that fact we should be not only confident but proud. No racist can take that away from any of us."
1,A book that is poorly written and stereotypes Asians.,"This book furthers stereotypes about Asian Americans and it ispoorly written. As a parent, I would not read this to my children. Ido not recommend it at all."
5,A beautiful story &#65533; captivates all ages,"My children and I loved Love as Strong as Ginger. The beautiful metaphors beg to be read aloud, and over and over again. There's a simple message of love, and the strength of a love to inspire one to dream to be whatever one wants to be. The story is even more poignant because of the complexities of a harsh real world setting. It's written in the voice of the child for children maybe 4 to 8, but I was captivated and think that much older children will be as well. It wouldn't surprise me if it wins an award - it's already a winner in my family!"
5,Great for Classroom Discussion,"My fourth-grade students never had a more lively discussion than after reading Love as Strong as Ginger. The work seemed to hit a really strong emotional chord with my students, most of whom are from immigrant homes. They all wanted to talk about their parents' jobs, their grandparents' jobs, and their own hopes and fears for the future. We need more books like this one. My students and I will be the first in line for Ms. Look's next books."
2,My kids found this book hard to follow.,"I was a bit disappointed by this book. The summary made the book seem interesting, but my children didn't really enjoy this book. I, too, did not like the way the story was told. The story was too superficial for my older child and my youngest child had a hard time understanding the book."
2,Book: The Master Mathmetician,"This book was dull and lacking. Very basic information, not in depth.Should have been a rabbit hole, like learning about God always is.It barely pointed out anything that I didn't already know :/"
2,A terrible movie made bearable by Jessica Alba,"This movie was absolutely horrible.I can buy the general concept (the DVD case tells us that it is a real thing). I can buy the story. I can buy the twist. What I can't buy is the whole out-of-body experience aspect. I could buy it under certain circumstances. I could buy it if the character remained in the same room, aware of what was going on in the room. But the character leaves the room (out-of-body) and becomes aware of things in a completely implausible and even IMPOSSIBLE way.I would even be willing to buy such a plot in a movie meant to be science fiction, but that's not what this movie is meant to be. This movie is meant to be a thriller, a work of suspense, and such a plot element doesn't work in this case.As the title of my review states, the only thing that makes this movie bearable is the undying beauty of Jessica Alba."
2,Good concept that could have been better executed,"Jessica Alba and Hayden Christensen were pretty good in their roles as a conniving woman and a heart transplant patient, respectively. The film purports to be about being awake yet paralyzed during surgery--a horror film in itself. But the movie veers away from that and into some weird conspiracy involving the woman and the surgical team, and I'm not totally clear on what they were trying to get away with.Try again."
4,A psycho thriller with surprising plot twists,"4 of 5 stars for the psycho thriller movie Awake. This movie starts by giving stats on how many patients per year enter a strange awake-state called ""anesthetic awareness"" during surgery. OK, we can guess that this is the subject of this movie. The lead character, played by young Darth Vader Hayden Christensen is in need of a heart transplant. He marries his sweetheart (the sexy Jessica Alba) the night before the operation. As the surgery begins, lets just say it gets twisted with loads of surprises. A well created movie with a great plot and some real surprises. You should be warned that there are some graphic scenes during the surgery not for the weak stomach; I'd argue, they weren't really needed to advance the story. I do recommend this movie, however, not after a full meal."
2,Very weak storyline,"You know those movies that look very interesting on the previews but turn out to be such duds? This is one of those.The problem is not Jessica or Hayden -- who both look great -- itis the very lame premise of the story. Granted that I am willing to give some leeway for dramatic license, and this storyline has some dramatic twists and turns that provide surprise -- but this storyline is TOO much of a stretch in element after element after element.And except for the beautiful Miss Alba there is nothing else sufficiently redeeming about the movie to justify its existence. Sorry."
3,Awake - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B(?), C(?)MPEG-4 AVC BD-25 / High Profile 4.1Aspect ratio: 2.35:1Running time: 1:24:06Movie size: 20,61 GBDisc size: 23,88 GBAverage video bit rate: 25.00 MbpsDolby TrueHD Audio English 3160 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3160 kbps / 24-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsDolby Digital Audio French 448 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 224 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / Dolby SurroundSubtitles: English SDH / SpanishNumber of chapters: 12#Audio Commentary#Deleted Scenes#Under the Knife & Behind the Camera: The Making#Storyboard to film comparison#Theatrical trailer"
2,"""AWAKE"" MOVIE REVIEW","Predictable. I really can't get too excited about this movie. Now anything with Jessica Alba is a ""man treat"" but this one really was justaverage. All in all interesting and ok to watch but don't expect to be wide awake at the end."
5,Very enjoyable,"I thought this movie was very entertaining and alot more intelligent than most of the movies coming out lately. It was fun to watch, had a nice outline, and kept your interest. The only thing I didn't like was that the ending was a bit too fast, I would have enjoyed the movie to go on. Definetely one you can watch again, Hayden's acting was on the spot, very very good!!"
3,Not so bad,"A halfway decent thriller that slipped passed my movie radar until today. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a similar plot but that doesn't mean there isn't one out there.SPOILER ALERT: My only real complaint is during the out of body experience scenes. From what I've read on the subject, an o.o.b.e. doesn't involve time traveling. You can only do it in the present. I could be wrong here but I don't think I am. If they kept Hayden in the present, then the movie would've been much better.Anyway, I'm a fan of film noir in general and this movie definitely had some of those elements thrown in, which I didn't expect.I personally wouldn't own the DVD but I had no problems renting it. It's an entertaining way to spend 84 minutes."
4,interesante....,es una pelicula q desde el comienzo te pones a pensar q es lo q pasa en la vida q debes d tener precaucion....
4,Gasping Surgery Scenes,"I couldn't watch them split open Hayden Christensen's rib cage. It's like when you're flipping through the channels and you come across one of those Demented hospital specials on Discovery. I hate it and can't help but feel something in my own body. While with the rest of this low-key movie is great fun. I've heard absurd comments about the most trite things in this movie. Even that the Actors are too easy on the eyes! It's filled with big Stars who knock out their lines. Hayden was great while inner monologing. It was silly, in a dark way that was unexpected. Such lines as ""Oh S%%%^, am I supposed to feel that? No, hell no!"" And then him manning up was classic, shouting with sloppy manliness, ""IT DOESN'T HURT! HELL NO!"" I had so much fun watching this movie. Great, awesome find. In small ways it reminded me of a shallow version ofIkiru - Criterion Collection"
2,I fell asleep watching Awake,"Yet another movie with a fascinating premise that fizzles into typical Hollywood shlock. Do they really expect us to buy that this guy's girlfriend, and best friend doctor for YEARS are 1. in cahoots 2. have the balls to plan such a ridiculous thing 3. think that Jennifer Beals character would actually get hitched hours before he goes under the knife? 4. Terrance Howard's character would suddenly have remorse , narrating the end of the movie? Geeeez...I so knew what they were going to do with this movie...as far as the guy's 'flashback's when he magically jumps out of his body on the operating table. As scenes are going by, it's like ,yep, we're going to get Ye Olde Flashback here later in the movie. I truthfully fell asleep watching this stinker of a movie."
2,Unusual plot but........,"This was definitely a new story line but the execution was mediocre, at best. The whole thing took place in either the Mother and Son's home or at the hospital. Just kind of dull, if you ask me. It has the appearance of a rather low-budget flick. Not impressed. I would rather re-watch something that I have already seen (and liked) than to waste time/money on this one."
3,Interesting Concept For A Movie,"There are pros and cons with this movie.The Pros:* Interesting Storyline* Good acting, not great, but good* Nice amount of suspense* Good cast of actorsThe Cons:* The holes in the storyline... Like how is a 22 year old leading man smart & savvy enough able to run a huge, profitable corporation?* Yet this same leading man is still such a mamma'a boy, that he can't confront his mother & tell her anything about his girlfriend, let alone that he's now engaged to this very woman?* If this leading man is savvy enough to run a huge financial empire, then how can he be so duped by a woman????These and other loopholes in the storyline made it difficult to give this movie a higher rating."
3,"Sluggish beginning, good ending","This movie has a good cast and an interesting plot. Those who like terrifying thrillers might not find this to be a good movie. To me it leaned more towards a romantic suspense type of movie, although to most people the very idea of anesthesia is scary. Usually after a few minutes into watching a movie I can tell you what is going to happen but not this time. That in itself was a thrill to me, so I will allow you to see the movie and not be a spoiler. Will I watch it again? No!"
3,The Duchess Bakes A Cake,I ordered this book because the author wrote a book called How Many Dragon's Are Behind The Door with the same character's. The book was ok. The Dragon book was excellent. I would recommend reading Dragon's Behind The Door book.
1,Not remotely accurate.,Bought 2 of these due to price. Neither will easily find North even when placed on a flat surface. Compass dial/needle sticks constantly. Ended up tossing both. Would not want to rely on if lost in the woods.
3,Cheap compass,"It worked OK for about 3 months, and then a bubble formed inside the compass which minimized it's accuracy."
1,Quality matches price,"This was a poorly made product. Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW. Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find. I ended up returning this for a full refund."
2,Poor reliability,"Mine came with a bubble that affects the responsiveness/reliability of the disc. It's a very useful size and shape, and the bezel works well, for what it is, but this isn't a reliable navigation aid."
3,2 simple and 2 light,is not for heavy duty using you just for convenience um the price is lolol but it's not as expected
1,Falls apart,"After a week, it was in tiny pieces from normal use. Order a tube of superglue if you really want this!"
3,Handy compass,"I have attached the compass to my backpack and used it while I travel (walking on streets in Europe trying to read and understand street maps) and it has been very useful.I was very disappointed in the delivery charge, however. I ordered the compass along with serveral other items and understood that there would be no shipping charges. That was true for the items that I received directly from Amazon, but the compass was shipped from another provider and the shipping charges were almost 3 times the cost of the compass."
2,Watch out farmers of England! Conflict don't like you.,"At what point does the left-wing become the right? Round about here. Dangerously intolerant views in the lyrics on this CD. An average punk racket at best in terms of the music which is more unforgivable than the narrow-minded diatribe within. I dunno why this is called ""Anarcho-punk"", seems to me these guys have got the answer to everything and won't tolerate any deviancy from their party line. That ain't anarchy to me."
4,Reckless with a bonus!,"Bought this set for Reckless. Saw it on TV when it came out and loved it. Rented it some years ago and now own it. So I have seen it 3 times and will definitely watch again. Robson Green is super-sexy as the lovelorn doctor who falls for his bosses wife. Michael Kitchen as the husband and Francesca Annis as the wife are utterly believable. When you add in all the other character studies here, Robson's doctor friends, his working class dad et al you have a soap opera story but with superb acting and a whip-smart script. This is perfect escapism for the romantic.Also in the set is Anna Karenina. This is a wonderful version of the Tolstoy classic that I never even knew about. A real bonus. The weak link is Wuthering Heights. I never got beyond 15 minutes in. It's a dreadful version.Anyhow, Reckless and Anna still make this set worth buying. It's cheaper to get both together than separately and they are well worth owning."
3,there is so much more to Japan,"If this is representative of what is popular in Japan, there you have it, but I think it's missing so much and gives a false (small) impression of the amazing diversity and complexity in the Japanese music scene. Alternating between Taiko drums, cute westernized pop songs, a little shamisen and shakuhachi I find it lacks anything from the explosion of new innovative music from the Tokyo scene or even any Kabuki or Koto music. A little disapointing because I have come to expact great things from this series. Kudos and 1/2 star for the fun liner notes!"
3,why no gagaku?,"This collection is seemingly all embracing but actually it only scratches the surface.The highly distinctive and alluring 'Gagaku'(ancient Japanese court and dance music)is oddly absent.....i can't begin to imagine why.This music (violent yet poised) is quite unlike anything i've encountered and ought to have been represented.However,this warts and all portrait of Japanese music is full of surprises and there's plenty to enjoy."
3,A Couple,It didn't have most of his greatest hits. It had 2 or 3 of his greatest hits. I wes stretching it to give it 3 stars.
5,Love this Classic George Album,"I love George Strait, and I love this album. There are some classics in this and I could listen to them on repeat. Great Album!"
4,george's first greatest hits collection,"this is a really good album with some good songs on it but, it lacks the really good hits that his second greatest hits has.the best on this cd are ""fool hearted memory"" and ""down and out"". if you like george strait's older cd's than this greatest hits collection is for you."
4,a fine sample of George's first 4 years of music,"George Strait's Greatest Hits covers his first four years of music. Ten songs to some up 4 years. These may not be some of his best known songs these days, but George Strait's Greatest Hits houses some of his finest music. Classics like Unwound, Amarillo by Morning, and You Look so Good in Love just to name a few. Although there are more comprehensive packages out their Greatest Hits is a great introduction to the music of George Strait."
3,I was upset in the end.,"The reason I read romance novels is because I love the happily ever after. There is too much sadness in real life sometimes and I don't want to read about it for pleasure. Although the story was nice and there is a happy ending for the main characters, there is something tragic that happens to some other very lovable characters in the end that made me sad."
4,Huge book that I couldn't put down!!!,"Wow! This is a fantastic series of stories about the 3 Tyler siblings. And this is the first story in the series.Lucky Tyler is finds himself protecting a womans honor in a bar fight. He feels a magnetic connection to her, but the next morning, she is gone without a trace. When he finds out he's a suspect in a serious crime, he NEEDS to find her for his own alibi. They have an amazing chemistry that cannot be denied.Each one of these stories lead into the next and the journey is phenominal!This is a fantastic trilogy and I am not usually a ""re-reader"", but I am keeping this one to read again!"
3,Charles Dickens DVD Collection,The TV scripts are not as well written as some movie versions of the past. This version of Great Expectations (for example) is too dark for my taste.
3,Too advanced for my 15 month old,"This book is very nice, however it is too long and too involved for my 15 month old's attention span, he loses interest almost immediately and has never asked us to read it to him. I think it would be great for an older child expecting a sibling."
4,not just another Purple album,"I helped to engineer some of the tracks on this album (assistant engineer, at the time). Approach this album with an open mind. If you are looking for a hard rock Deep Purple style anthem then ""I can't dance to that"" will be the only track meeting that specific description. But, If you're interested in hearing the other sides of Roger Glover and Ian Gillan than I suggest you listen to tracks like: ""Takes My Breath Away"" and ""Dislocated"". One of the tracks was also used briefly on the movie ""The Rain Man"" in the scene where Tom Cruise has just picked up Dustin Hoffman and they're cruising down the highway listening to the radio. I'm not even dead sure if Thames Mgmt. was aware of it's use (Bruce?).This album is full of many surprises and points to some further directions Deep Purple would take later on. Just don't expect there to be much smoke on this water."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this item!,"Anyone who has a modicum of business or consulting savvy will not need this trite piece of Management 101. There is nothing wrong with the information; it is accurate and useful; it is just that we have all read and used this information in our first year of business. It is NOT worth the money; this is a free little article that you would have read in any business management magazine, journal or newspaper.Save your money and add it to a book by Drucker, Senge or Peters; that will be a far more valuable investment for your business development."
1,Almost worthless without the original color plates,"As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book."
3,Good poetry - Needs more plates,"When originally published, Albers' book had 150 plates. Not surprising for a treatise on the use of color in art. However, when you chop it down to 10 color plates, as is the case with this ""pocket"" volume, something is lost. Never-the-less, Albers is clearly a master of this topic, and his poetic prose is inspiring. Let's hope that the original volume is reprinted at some point."
3,A fair book from a great teacher.,I find it difficult to follow as I think it is written for a class and needs the instructor to flesh out the concepts.
2,Doesn't deserve the prestige that it has,"Unfortunately, this book is seen by many as a ""Book of Genesis"" in regards to color theory, which it is not at all. Color is somewhat relative due to context--got it. However, there is a lot more to color than that. Josef Albers was hardly a good role model for painters who want to learn to use color for artistic ends and his star is fading."
2,Interesting story turned into a bore,"Most readers of ""The Rebel Who Lost His Cause"" will probably conclude that John Beckett led a fascinating life during extraordinary times. Nevertheless, the author lets the story drag throughout much of the work, making a 215-page book feel much longer. The author depends too heavily on Beckett's own writings. Given that the author is the son of the book's subject, I would have liked to see a greater number of sources and more perspectives in this work. An author would have to TRY to make Beckett's life seem dull, but somehow, the author succeeded at doing just that."
1,GE Outdoor Wireless,"This product could have been great,with 8 channels to use but it was slow and only worked good at night time.During day time ,sometimes it did not work at all."
2,Outdoor outlet receiver,"The first one I recevied did not work, the 2nd on I received works some of the time. Not worth purchasing."
1,p.o.s. !! waste my time & money & a special trip to the post off!,"Claimed a range of 100 to 150ft & the fact is 5 ft or less & you have to point right at the receiver to have it working!! It carried a GE logo, what a shame!"
2,Keychain Remote bad,"The Plug in box works very well with the wall switch unit, but the Keychain remote is very bad. The Chanel switch does not work 99% of the time and then only if on channel 1 or 8 I have not gotten the other channels to work at all. Do not bye the keychain remote, bye the wall/desktop unit instead. They needed to use the same channel changing switch on the keychain unit they use on the wall and plug unit."
5,Great product!!,"This product is flawless! Not quite sure where the bad reviews are comming from, its simple and easy to use the range of the remote is even better than what it says it is, for me the remote works from a distance of at least 200 feet even when pointed in the opposite direction in daylight or darkness i use them for outside lights i cant speak for everyone but i have purchased three of these and they are flawless well worth it."
1,Defective GE receiver,Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the outdoor receiver and remote. Doesn't work. Played around with different settings and no response or light from the receiver. Anyone know of a similar product other than GE that is reliable and works?
2,Ge Outdoor Switch,This switch works OK as long as it is not cold. Once it gets around freezing it will not switch.
2,REMOTE DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO,REMOTE WILL TURN ON AS STATED BUT TO TURN OFF YOU HAVE TO BE IN FRONT... UP CLOSE... TO RECEIVER.
1,Outlet receiver with key chain remote.,The seller did not send the outlet with the Keychain so I have a useless device without the complete package. I would caution others to beware of buying from this vendor.
5,Best Golf Sandals I've ever had,"I love golf sandals and have had 5 or 6 different styles. These are by far the most comfortable and best looking on the foot that I have ever tried. Easy to adjust to the foot, and I have a wide foot. Wore them all day with no problems, even going to the store after golf."
5,Hypafix tape,"Best tape in the world for someone (as I am) who is allergic to many types of tape, and is needed. Would recommend this product to anyone. Fast, easy, and great priced. Will continue to order this product."
5,Thank goodness for this tape!,"I went through major surgeries that required a lot of bandaging, only to discover that I got contact rashes from ALL the tapes!! I kind nurse introduced me to Hypafix, and its awesome. It does not curl when you pull off the back and get stuck to itself. It has nice cutting grids on the back. It breathes. It sticks great, put still peels off without major pain. But best of all - it does not leave me covered in painful rashes. Thank goodness, all this healing I have to do just got way more tolerable!"
5,Product review,This is a great story about one of the biggest wrestling superstars in history. I highly recommend this to any wrestling fan.
5,breathtaking!!!,"I could not put this book down!! I had to buy her other books in the Series, and just keep wanting to soak up more. If you pick this book up, you are in for a long night cuz you wont put it down until your finished. Rebecca York has the ability to sweep the reader into the story."
2,Witching Moon (Berkley Sensation),"Haven't finished reading it, I actually put it aside because it is very stiff, doesn't grab my attention and I feel like the book is talking down to me. I have read previous Berkley Sensation books (which is why I purchased this one) but have not been impressed with this one."
3,Im too curious for my own good!!,"I thought this was a very good book. It was well written with lots of beautiful descriptions and a combo of romance and action. I wish it included the translation for the words that bring about the transformation into a werewolf. Can anyone tell me what 'taranis, epona, cerridwen. Ga. Feart. Cleas. Duais. Aithriocht. Go gcumhdai is dtreorai na deithe thu.' means?twiztedimage2003@yahoo.comTHANK YOU AND ENJOY THE READ!!Rachel"
3,Slow read!,I'm reading this book now and all I can say is it is a slow read. I'm not at all enthralled about it. Sometimes books hook me from the 1st page and I don't want to put it down. Well this isn't one of those books. I will probably force my self to read the rest of it but it just isn't what I thought it would be.
2,Does Not Do ....,"For what purpose would anyone buy D Skins? To protect your CDs or DVDs while you are playing them! Instead however, the D Skins seem to reduce the image quality of DVDs to that of low VHS quality and cause them to continually loop back to the start menu after reaching the same point in the same chapter of that DVD. I've tried repositioning and replacing the D Skin with no success. D Skins are a great idea but they don't do what they claim to do."
4,Could Colors Be Unreal?,"The Quest for Reality is clearly and forcefully written, and poses important challenges to the varieties of color irrealism and color subjectivism it discusses. While I don't regard these challenges as uniformly successful, what Stroud says about these topics is engaging and fresh.(...)"
3,stave churches,I was looking for a fine catalogue of interior and exterior wood carvings which are almost finer than Irish tracery. These did not materialize. A lot of work which missed the real point of the art work. How dumb are these authors
2,Good looking watch but...,"This watch looks really nice new, and the mechanics seem to be holding up now 6 months later. My complaint is that since it's designed for boys (and if you're shopping for a boy, you probably know how boys play) the face cover could be made with a different material. Scratches are going to happen, and I expect that, but what disappoints is that any and all scratches are so noticeable. On most watches a scratch is simply a line, but on this watch a scratch causes a cloudy effect all around each scratch to the point where it's obvious from several feet away. That's too bad, and for the price, one would think this watch could handle scratches better. Just a couple of days wearing the watch, and the inevitable happened. I don't blame the company for my son's activity level, but if they're making a watch for boys, the cover needs to be made from a different material to handle scratches better. I will look for another brand next time."
5,Simply Awesome,"Having recently been inspired by Phish's music and their diverse stylings, I decided to check out Trey's solo work. I have to admit I can't decide what's better. Trey alone, or Trey with Phish. However, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Anastastio is a musical genius! All of these live songs are mindblowing in how they are played out for so long. You would think a 22 minute jam would get boring! FAR FROM IT. If you are a fan of Phish then you owe it to Trey to check out this live record and his solo record as well. And if you were curious like me you will not be let down I promise!"
1,Welcome Home disappointment,"Item did not work and seller did not respond to my email regarding how to make arrangements for return of item.This movie meant so much to my husband, but was left with disappointment of not being able to watch it."
2,Why spend $100 more,I bought this unit thinking I could walk around with the radio and listen to XM. However the reception is horrible without being plugged into the car or home base and thus the antenna. So why spend $300 when you can get a cheaper unit with home and car adapters for a lot less and not be so upset at the wasted money.
1,Portable reception is horrible,"I bought tbe Airware hoping to have a portable music source with variety. I love XM Radio, but I give the Airware a big thumbs down. It is supposed to have a built in antenna for getting XM on the go. Well, I live in a urban area and would say I get conistent signal about 10% of the time. I even bought an additional antenna to attach to the device and still the signal is spotty. So basically, I only use the Airware in my car in hooked up to the home kit in my house. If I wanted it for these uses I could have paid $50 for say a Delphi Roady 2 instead of over $200."
1,Electronica Direct Bad Customer Service,AWFUL customer service. Radio worked 12 hours then died. Then to return the itemn I entered RETURN HELL. Customer Service Line was alsways busy. I got through once and had to hang up after 32 minutes on hold.Absolutely HORRIBLE service. I recommend Amazon quit using this vendor.
3,Great Technology With A Flaw,I must say I do agree that XM Radio is a beautiful thing. It makes the long car rides that much more enjoyable.I am currently on my 2nd Pioneer XM unit and I will tell you why. I had owned the unit a little less than a month and I experienced a memory storage problem. I would program my favorite stations while I was driving and then turn off the car. When I started the car again I would lose all of the stations that I just programeed. The same applied to recording of music.Now I have my 2nd unit since it was covered under the retailer's warranty. I have experienced memory loss but it is not as frequent as everytime I start the car.Other than the problem I am experiencing I do enjoy my XM Radio very much. I hope this helps.
1,Has to be something better.,"After 2 months of use the unit completly failed and I had to send it back for a replacement. The customer service company was very helpful and friendly, but I was shocked that it failed so soon.The ear buds have a bad design at the point where they go into the jack on the unit, the wire frays right there and eventually breaks.Don't get fooled into thinking that the ""built-in"" antenna really works because it only functions when all the conditions are just right, which is about 5% of the time.I do not like the fact that I cannot pick and chose what songs I can save from the songs that I downloaded. Overall I would not reccomend this product."
1,battery cover stuck,"Just received my Airwave and fresh out of the box, the battery cover is jammed on. Back it goes. Sad, I am."
2,Get a MyFi Lite instead!,"If your ear has been to the ground recently, then you may have heard that more XM2Go models are coming. Well folks, they're here, and they aren't an improvement.They are the Giant ""Tao"", and the Pioneer ""Airware"". Both models include the full car and home kits that the standard MyFi kit offers, and sadly, the same price as well.This a bit surprising when it comes to the Tao, as it's literally the OEM version of the MyFi, except with a different black finished shell. Giant, who makes the MyFi for Delphi, has trotted this out in an effort to cash in as well, but instead of the savings you'd expect without the Delphi branding, the unit is still close to $300. The Airware, on the other hand, looks quite different. It is narrower, looking a bit less like an iPod than the other two, bit more like a iPod mini, or a cell phone. It's also less ergonomic in design, with its controls laid out in a grid pattern. It also will retail for around the same price.(...)"
5,Covers grey best,"I've used this product for years to color my mom's hair and a friends hair. We tried other developers, but they didn't cover the grey as well and for as long as this one."
4,"Great for Art, not for ABC's","Although I rarely find an ABC book I find satisfactory, this one was worse than most as an introduction to the alphabet. ""A is for artist"" is not a good introduction for the letter A as ""ar"" is a relatively advanced sound for a beginning reader. ""I is for island"" has not only the long i but also a silent s; this is most confusing for a young child. It is much better to use the short vowel sounds for the vowels and the hard c and g sounds in an ABC book used as an introduction to the alphabet for a young child.Thus I will not be using this book as ABC book; I will use it as a art book for my young son. Fortunately it should seve that purpose quite well as the pictures are indeed lovely and quite varied. If I were rating it only as an art book for young children, it would have 5 stars. Truly I look forward to sharing it with him this summer and using it as means of developing his verbal language skills. I just wish I could use it as an ABC book as well without reservation."
2,Brian Hooks is a trip as always:I'd say 2&half,"Brian Hooks Films are always something that I gotta peep out.He cracks me up without trying so hard.I saw this one over the weekend&was cracking up over the Areath Franklin Bills.that was funny.I still dig ""Nothing to Lose""&""3 Strikes"" as my Favorite Hooks Films but this one was pretty good compared to the past few He has done.the Commentary cracks me up.that was Funny."
4,Great for all brides!,"I bought this book a few weeks after I got engaged, and it is wonderful. I knew practically nothing about wedding planning, and this was a life-saver. The software is a bit old school, but it is great for putting together guests lists and making sure things get done in a timely fashion. I really liked the money saving tips and lists of questions to ask service providers. I would recommend this for anyone who is doing all their own planning and doesn't have a lot of time for figuring this stuff out on your own!!"
1,Who is this book for?,"Seems that cutting and pasting any old text together and calling it a book is what happened here. With a book titled "" Disney world with kids"" you have to wonder when there are text entries such as""skip this if you don't have kids"". I do not think the writer actually went near some of the attractions as the comments appear to be rehashings of older promotional discriptions. Avoid this book."
3,Delay in receiving the item,"I've ordered the T-Shirt on Dec 14th assuming I'll receive it before Christmas. I bought this T-shirt for my friend's daugher in India. I left India on Dec 24th without receiving it. After my return only, I got the T-shirt. It's with me still. For mailing this T-shirt, it'll cost $15 (more thant the purchase price).I'm really disappointed with the shipping process.ThanksRavi."
3,Kitchen-sink approach but a useful reference tool,"This overview of the history and popularity of the jigsaw puzzle offers a kitchen sink approach, bombarding the reader with tidbits on just about every aspect you could imagine. While there is some worthwhile information and a nice selection of color photos, I found I skipped about half the book. Still, I'll be keeping it on my shelves for future reference."
1,Not this one for sure!,"I am not sure what book the other two readers have read but it sure is not this one, I have been in the business for a number of years and the author offers trite remarks and even worse idioms to pad the book out. If you are interested in XML or Java I would suggest another book such as Mastering Java which actually tells you what Java and XML are for."
1,I Thought Wrong...,"""Coffin's Ghost"" is supposed to be a mystery/thriller novel, but unfortunately, there is neither in this book. I was so excited to read this book and it took forever for me to find a place to order it from. I recieved the book and was utterly disappointed. There is no mystery or suspense in this novel whatsoever. This book came from England and it is extremely hard to follow, the book skips around like a rabbit in a field. You never know why something happens and you are always left hanging there. The characters are introduced randomly and they are speaking in ""short-hand"" making it hard to follow and understand. After reading this book I still have no idea what it was about. This novel has no plot or theme. Not reccommended."
3,aggrey's review.,"Iam a born again christian and i have been very blessed by the reviews of those that have listened to this music and i believe that when i come to get them i will also be greatly blessed as I love praise & worship.Do you have video tapes of same?.How can i buy video tape or cd as iam based in East Africa -Kenya,p.o.box 90431 mombasa.Please Furnish me with information.God bless you. Aggrey Mwandawiro."
4,Did its job this summer,"Can't complain, the swimsuit did its job this summer, allowing my baby the ability to swim with us. The hat was ridiculously huge for my 3 month old, maybe next summer it will fit..."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"I was very disappointed with this book, especially since I enjoyed Leto's books beforehand. Did not like the heroine in the story, nor any of the characters. Teach me to buy books on author's name alone... First book in a LONG TIME that I chucked across the room in disgust."
5,Awesome,"I bought this CD a week ago and have been listening to it non-stop since. Nobody combines electronic music with didgeridoos, sitars, and ethereal vocals like these guys. Each song builds to it's particular frequency- and so does the album. Each track gets progessively more beat-driven and the effect is awesome. With the exception of a couple chill-out tracks, by the end of the CD you'll feel like a tribal warrior dancing on the eve of your greatest conquest. Ok that might be a little over the top. I'm not a ""flying person"" like the producer says but I got pretty close flying down the freeway at around 100mph listening to this CD. ... Seriouly- if you like Thievery Corporation, Kruder and Dorfmeister, Govinda, etc.- you'll dig this. Give it a listen."
3,Nice Belt - Order One Size Larger,I ordered this for my husband who wears a size 35 and it barely fit around him. Nice quality and all; just order at least one size larger.
5,Amazing despite its flaws,"I've read a few books about forgiveness, anger, etc. I found most of them are simplistic and ultimately unsatisfying.Karen's book, the Forgiving Self, could be accused of many things, but simplistic is not one of them. The wisdom and depth of this book is profound, yet it is still ultimately quite accessible (if not always easy reading).There are concepts like how we hold onto unforgiveness to protect, and then develop, stories we tell about ourselves, and part of forgiveness means letting go of those stories, which in turn often reveals some uncomfortable truths about ourselves. If you want to stay safe and find justification for blaming it all on the other person, this is NOT the book for you.If you want to understand the paradox of being able to love someone and hate someone at the same time, check it out.Yes, he is rather self indulgent at times, but while some editing would be helpful, even the self indulgent bits are ultimately useful."
3,"Loss, Resentment, Connection","""What we do in the realm of forgiveness says a great deal about both how we mourn our losses and how well we have separated psychologically from our parents, two fundamental issues in emotional health and development."" Dr. Karen's long introduction is unusually astute: ""There are many reasons why forgiveness may be difficult, impossible, or wrong."" Addressing both the wronged and weary and the ashamed and hiding, he has written a psychologically sophisticated exploration of the complex dynamics of (the usual suspects of) authentic relationship and forgiveness -- not at all as ""misty,"" sentimental or politically correct moral virtue -- that deserves your unsentimental attention."
2,Too technical,"Hard to read.....didn't finish it. I found it way too technical and didn't glean any practical advice but then agian I didn't read it all the way through, either. Just couldn't do it."
5,outstanding introductory text,"Walt Woods was a schoolteacher, and it shows in this, however, this is still one of the best introductions to dowsing there is. Yes, it's also available as a free download, and then you have to get it printed; for me it was easier and cheaper to order the paper version, here. This comes highly recommended by Raymon Grace, whose books are well worth looking at."
5,not just for high-school graduation!,"I thought this book was great - i bought it for my friend's college graduation, and was a bit worried before it arrived that it might be more the reading enjoyment level of a high-school student, but it has all sorts of writings, excerpts from the classics, historical speeches, poems, etc. and all are inspiring no matter what stage of life you may be in."
3,"Except for the foul language, great book.....","I was dismayed to find this particular ""Little Big Book.........."" contained some really offensive foul language from Whoppi Goldberg and Chris Rock. It was not needed to make their points! I suggest you send them both dictionaries to help express themselves more kindly in a book that young children will read (or be read to). The rest of the book lived up to the fine standards of the other books in this series."
4,temperment God gave you,will refer back to this book several times. Helpful info on how to approach areas that need to be worked on in a relationship.
4,Great Product!,"I purchased this product after hearing about how well it helps the hair and makes it shiny! I was pleasantly surprised by this product! Each time I wash my hair, I use it to seal my ends. The only bad thing I can say about Amla lite is that you have to get used to the smell. It's not horrible, but you'll definitely have to get used to it."
5,Sony Vaio VGN-AR250G,"We used this notebook for our worship music in Church. It works great with MS Power Point, the timing is very accurate so the timing used in rehearsing is the timing you get in the replaying of Power Point files. We run the output to an amp and the sound is great, the picture are very bright and clear. Great product!"
4,My wife needed tote for her work as a home care nurse,"My wife needed tote for her work as a home care nurse, this one looked like it would fit the use for her. so far she likes it."
5,Nice Bag,"She loves the bag, and they provide the best customer service after the sale. Followed up to be sure my spouses new gym bag was perfect!!! Great experience..."
4,Great heavy duty bag,"Some of the other reviews comented on the smell. Mine has no smell what so ever. I love the large front pocket with places for phone, pens or whatever. This will be great the next time I fly or go on a cruise. I'll be able to keep all the paperwork in the front for easy access while my camera, wallet and such stay safely zipped away."
4,Organized Tote Bag,This Tote surprised me I did not think it would be made as well as it is. I carry alot of stuff and it is nice that it has dividers and pockets. I hope it last me awhile.
5,Perfect,"I can't begin to tell you how perfect this tote is. It's not too big and not too small. It has plenty of compartments and it holds so many items securely. I used it recently on a trip to Miami and was even able to carry 1/2 dozen bagels for my son who requested them And fit all my own ""stuff."" It zippers closed which is such an important feature since you don't want your things falling out."
5,Perfect everyday bag,This is now my daily bag to/from work. My lunch bag fits inside of it too. Just right - and you can't beat the price.
4,Good buy,This bag was a good buy for the money. It has alot of different pockets inside. Perfect as a tote for papers and magazines. Carried it in NYC so I would have room for all my stuff.
3,Zafir - Entertaining for an evening,"Zafir is another movie for horse lovers who are satisfied with images of horses. The story line is ok, but not captivating. The viewer does empathize with the children who love Zafir and are frustrated by adults who do not understand this. The movie fills an evening well enough, however, I would not watch it twice. Zafir serves its purpose for an evening.Zafir"
4,Good Identification Resource,A lot of work went into documenting all the Luger holsters and accessories included in this book. I especially like it because it documents many Luger paper items such as manuals and catalogs. You will not find much in the way of narrative text in this book.
4,I received a different product...,"...from DNL Enterprises, but I'm not complaining.Pros:- I like how it doesn't cover any controls, including the hold switch.- It didn't come with a lanyard, but it came with a belt clip. In my opinion, a belt clip is actually better if one were jogging or working out and such.Cons:- Removing the case can be a hassle. No, seriously, it took skill.- It also leaves the display unprotected.I just shaped the screen protector that came with the Nano package to compensate for the last item. Five dollars for a hard-case, I'm not complaining for what I got."
3,Travel Guitar,"The Johnson Travel Guitar is actually pretty nicely put together for an inexpensive guitar. Chinese-made (surprise, what isn't these days) but decent fit, finish and intonnation. Due to the small soundbox, it's quite quiet, but action is good."
5,This is the best tax guide yet.,"I must say, I was weary of plunking down my money, but with thier money-back guarantee, I figured I'd give it a shot. This is the best tax book I've read. It was concise, yet very readable and easy to understand."
2,An Okay Read,"This book, by reading the back cover was what one might expect. Girl leaves town, girl returns to town and reclaims her first love... Well Holly left her hometown and left Jake, her boyfriend, and her group of friends behind for a better life. Being the town's 'misfit' when Holly was going through school, along with her 'misfit' friends... A book, which I was glad to pick up at the library and not waste 6 dollars on, would not be as welcomed on my bookshelf along with the others I have. Spend the 6 dollars on a great book and not a page dragger..."
2,Decent,Typical romance level written on a third grade level but good story. Keep in mind if you're looking for a great piece of literature this is not it. If you're looking to be thoroughly entertained for a few hours then this your book. They're are way better romance novels out there but this will certainly wet your appetite.
3,There is just something missing......,"I read this book with the hopes of it being up to Ms. Taylor past books and I found it lacking. I knew who the ""bad guy"" was within the fist 75 pages so the ending was anti-climatic. The love story between the two leading players, Jake and Holly was; in my opinion, not even believeable becuase it seemed like the conclusion of the book was rushed to give them having a happy ever after ending plus we knew more about Lizzie and Dylan who were suppose to be secondary players in this book. It made me wish she had of just told their story with Jake and Holly as secondary players. Oh well better luck next time........"
4,A nice complimation of old meets new.,"A great complication of Welk's music remixed for a newer generation. I originally heard 'Bubbles in the Wine'(Dex Dubious) on WXPN in Philly a few years back and a few other selections from the album over thelast few years.If you are into remixes, and diverse music, you'll really enjoy this album. Also the album is rootkit free, so itwill play on any any CD player."
2,"OK, but there are better","What the description doesn't give is the supplemental information. So, here's what you may need to know:Recommendation: Take 3 capsules twice daily, preferably with food.3 capsules contains:500 mg calcium (50% daily value)250 mg magnesium (63% daily value)15 mg zinc (100% daily value)5 mg sodium (<1% daily value)Capsules are about one inch long."
3,Natures Way Mag. and Zinc,"This is the first time my Husband had used this product. He usually gets a Cal/Mag/Zinc product but I must have ordered this by mistake or because I thought it was a better price. Either way, I will go back to ordering the 3 part combo again since my husband does not like using my chewable calcium supplements because he thinks they are too sweet."
1,"Missed oppourtunity by ""Amazon""",I ordered this product twice from your vendors and both did not send the fairlead roller. I was held up on my project by three weeks because of the delay. I hope you have not charged me for a product that I did not receive. If you are asking me how I liked a product your vendors did not ship it leads me to think that your system is haywire and I will think twice about ordering from your service.
4,Anchored in the 12th century,"This fascinating book focussed on unusual and sometimes disturbing themes. Set following the turn of the previous millenium, the book is set around the life of Radegunda, the anchorite of the title, and the convent she is walled up in. I hugely enjoyed the book, though found the details of anchorite life a little too detailed!"
4,A Tool Time Mom Project Book!,A great source of ideas with goood direction & intruction. Some tools required may not be accessible though. Good photos and extended ideas for the end projects.
5,SEDUCTIVE!,"I could not put this book down!! The writing and character development draws you more and more into the life of Sasha, which I can totally relate to. When I first got the book, my boyfriend laughed at the title, that was until I read the first 55 pages. I couldn't keep my hands off him one night and he loved it!!If you want to spice up your love life or get caught up in the passion of Sasha's life, read this book...you won't regret it!"
3,Enough is Enough,"Let's be honest. How many women out here have slept with someone else's man and knew this man was either married or seeing somebody? When do you say enough is enough.Sasha is not your average woman. She doesn't mean to do it, it just happens. How you could resist a sexy multimillionar basketball player with the name of Phoenix Carter? Making more money that you have ever made. Plus his beautiful fiance and two little children don't know.Easily, the first man you slept with had wife and committed suicide right in your bedroom. Stop. This is not the lifestyle to go.Brenda Thomas gives us something to look at with this book. How easy it is for a man/woman to cheat on his/her significant other. You see how I said his/her. Women we cheat too. Brenda doesn't get that far into it, the book is an easy read but she gives just enough to think about if our man is cheating."
4,Excellent Read,This was an excellent book for a first time author. I will admit that it was a little slow going very early in the book but you get a sense for who the characters really are and you can feel yourself there with them. The theme and laguage can be a little sexual but I felt that it belonged there based on the characters. I happened to spot a blooper in the book and wrote to Ms. Thomas. She was gracious enough to write back thanking me and mentioned that she was glad to see that a man was enjoying the book.
3,A Quick Read...!!!!,"I was compelled to read this book after the author forwarded me an excerpt. Threesome was a definite page-turner and packed a lot of story in a few pages; however, the writing style was very simple and there were areas that could have been better developed (Sasha's relationship with her father and son, her mental welfare/psychological evaluations). I didn't feel her promiscuous actions were justifiable enough with the sketchy explanations received. I was disappointed at the ending, which just didn't tie everything together for me. I don't feel that this was a bad book by any means, but it could have been much better. Read the book for yourself before you read the reviews...Over-hyped, just like Addicted!"
1,"Threesome:Where Seduction,Powere and Basketball Collide","Save your money and don't buy this book! The title is probably the best part. The author states in the beginning that she has been ""blessed with the gift of writing."" If she has it is not evident in this novel. Poorly, written and full of cliches the author uses every soft porn situation ever published. After the first two pages I skimmed through the chapters where apparently no matter what events may take place, sex happens also. The author has gotten much publicity because of the Kobe Bryant case. Don't follow the hype. Avoid this paperback ditty like the plague."
1,dont buy this book,"THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE. fIRST OF ALL IT WAS TO SHORT, IT LACKED A REAL RESOLUTION, SHE WAS A SEX FIEND, NO DEPTH AS TO WHY SASHA IS LIKE THAT."
1,Just some good old drama.,I loved this book from beginning to end because of the wonderful storyline. It was so real and gave so much information. I like forward to reading other books by Brenda L. Thomas.
5,"""Great Excitement""!","The author wrote this book in a way that was easy to understand. She included intense details about what was going on in the characters' personal life. From the first page, I just couldn't put it down. Those couple of pages kept me hooked. It made me want to know what was going to happen next.I really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who would want to know what the ""inside"" life would be like whenever it is that you enter the ""real world"". This book shows how a female was in 3 different relationships, and in the end it effected her life dramatically. It showed great examples on what hardships you would come across when you get older, and are choosing to deal with the opposite sex(mate). On a scale from 1-5 with 5 being the highest, I would most definitely give this book 5 stars*****. You would really be astonished at what things are really happening in this book!"
3,So So,"This was just ok....I think because it had some much drama that happened before the previous drama ended made it seemed rushed. Essentially all the main character did was sleep with several men and the only sub plot developed was with her son. I'd be curious to see the author devote more effort to developing an actual story line, I think she is a talented writer."
3,?,"Not the best book in the world, but a good, quick read. If you are looking for something fast paced this is for you. If you are looking for quality reading material- look elsewhere. This book will keep you engaged, but provides no lasting effects."
5,A DEFINITE PAGE TURNER!!!,I READ THIS BOOK IN A DAY! COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! IT CAPTIVATED ME! IT'S AN EASY READ! SASHA'S ANTICS MAKES ONE SAY: SAY WHAT???? WHAT IS SHE THINKING ABOUT????? BUT I CONSIDER THAT A GOOD THING. IT MAKES THE BOOK ALL THE MORE ENTICING TO READ!BRENDA THOMAS DOES AN AWESOME JOB!
5,Looking for love in all the wrong places,This book was excellent the author got in there told the storydidn't have to describe every noun in the book. The story is truly full of seduction and power. A must read.
3,THREESOME HUNH?? DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU THINK,"First of all this book is very short only 138 pages; however it does hold your interest. Sasha is involved with a married man, Cole. He leaves her when tragedy strikes them both. To get her mind off of her problems, Sasha takes on the job of personal assistant to Phoenix Carter, a young up-and coming basketball star. She begins to develop a sexual attraction towards her boss; to move away from those feelings she falls for a man named Trent. He appears to be her ""knight in shining armor"" or is he?? Sasha knows about Trent's 13 yr old daughter but does she know about the child he's about to have?? Trent puts Sasha first in his life and they think about a future but when the curtain falls where will they both end up?? You'll just have to read to find out."
4,I Could Not Put It Down,I loved this book. I could not get enough. The characters were believeable and you knew from the first chapter that this book would be not be like your used to from the heroins in books. My only critism was that it was too short. I wanted to keep reading when it was over. I hope there is a sequel really soon.
4,Sasha's Addiction,"First of all I read Brenda L Thomas book ""The Velvet Rope"" which was a page turner for sure, but when she spoke on Sasha a brief moment in that book I knew I had to meet her. I keep telling myself thoughout this book that this character is 38 yrs old which really threw me off. She had it going on. Her relationships with these men were totally sexual.To think that she didn't have a mother, sounded more like she didn't have a father. Each man wanted her sex and she loved it. Phoenix would be any personnel assistant dream boss. What single women wouldn't fall for him. I knew her and Cole would not last after his wife's suicide. And Trent, well he had his own issues with baby-mamma drama. I personally thought she should have stayed with Phoenix and rode the wave."
3,i give it three stars,"only because the book was so short but was filled with excitement and adventures.the book is awesome! but i was disappointed because of its shortness! but it is awesome so please get the book it is worth it i just thought it was longer but it is a good book if you read fast like me take your time with the book, but it is going to be hard"
2,Not at all!,"I didn't like the way this book started, but I kept reading. I finally had my fill when she slept with her employer. I find these type book annoying, so I gave it away."
4,Vivid novel,"Threesome will have your fingers turning to the next page! The title is not what it may seem. Brenda Thomas gives us a novel that is vivid and bold. You as the reader feel as though you are experiencing the trails and triumph with Sasha, the main character. The novel will really have you asking questions about love, loyalty and honest. Collide is an understatement to the drama in this book. I highly recommend Threesome for your bookshelves."
3,Not one of their best,"I have this CD and I wanted to provide some input. I am a big fan of NBB and have most of their albums. However, I found this one to be fairly weak when compared to the others. My favorite song on the album is ""Luckiest Man Alive"", which is a really wonderful song. But, most of the songs are just so-so. Fairly well done, but not memorable."
5,Foreign Language for Children,This is an absolutely incredible book! Simple children's games turned into foreign language learning games! And the part about monolingual-friendly is amazing yet so simple. You really don't have to speak a second language to teach one...Every elementary school in America needs a copy!!!
3,Not for Windows Vista,Easy to install and good graphics and performance. Shader Model is 2.0 and not 3.0 for Windows Vista and display intensely flickers with refresh
1,Dissapointed,"i bought this for the convenience of playing my favorite game, The Sims2 Pets (game cube edition) on the train. what I got was a piece of junk so small that it wouldn't fit the disc, there isn't even a place for the Cable! even if it could take both, the screen is waaay to tiny. Thank you Apple, you disappointed me again."
3,"Great Music, Poor sound","The music on this CD is great, the jamming is there, the energy and fun that Savoy Brown had is evident, and its the only live recording I know of of Hellbound Train. Is it worth having, yes, for dedicated SB fans but the sound quality is sure to dissappoint. The bass is muddied and too out front, the drums just have no snap, and worse of all, Kim Simmons guitar sounds like somebody forgot to turn up his amp. You really have to perk your ears to hear him at all on many cuts. Overall, it sounds like somebody recorded this concert from outside the building on a portable cassette player, in a barrel. I did enjoy a listen to this based on the music and historical content but I just won't be able to repeat this cd to many times because of the sound quality."
1,Bonanza 10 pack videos,Madacy Videos does a very poor job in the copying of these wonderful shows. The sound is terrible and the videos is fuzzy and hard to see. It's a shame....this television series deserves a lot better than this....If anyone knows of someone other than Madacy Videos that does copies of the Bonanza series....let me know. Sad....Sad..mbk in ark
2,Bonanza 10 vhs Collectors edtion,"Now I know why Columbia House charges so much for there videosof televison shows!You can actualy watch those!The audio wasthe worst I've seen yet!Sometimes you can't make out what isbeing said!If you can get it to track on your vcr your lucky!Not real intro,closing credits edited,snowy picture sometimescolors smeared or faded in certain places!Someone who worked on the show should not allow these copies to be made and sold!"
1,What?,"If you order this set of videos, you had better have at least 3 video machines in your home, because, chances are these tapes will not track on two of them. These are absolutely the worst videos I have ever seen. They can hardly be heard, the picture is grainy, and that is at its best. On most VCRs, they will be full of static, both audio and picture. Wish I could have given this a negative 5 stars... Just terrible."
2,Another title under the knife..,"No original title cards are on the episodes... ""Maids in Japan"" was edited when Alvin Simon and Theodore tried to escape the cab when Dave takes them back to the hotel. That scene is not in this DVD edition. The editing and changes need to stop! The fans should have the right to see the shows in their original Presantation... From what I have seen in terms of the latest releases, it seems that Peramount and Bagdasarian Productions are going around in circles... I think a disclamer should be put on the package letting customers know if the show has been altered in any way..."
3,a little rehashed,I admit I was disapointed It's ok but I have several of these befor & I bought them in the last 3 years.Daves getting married is a very cute episode but was on their thanksgiving DVD. now I have it twice.Every chipmunk tells a story and Maids in Japan are both in the Alviiin DVD since I lost that DVD I was glad to have them back but would have appriciated something new more I think Romancing Miss Stone was in the Alviiiin DVD too.shrinking dave & Mothers day were 1s I'd never seen & very good but still 2 out of 6?What about that great 1 when alvin looses his trademark hat & can't go onstage without it? It's kinda nice to see his vulnerable and insecure side.
4,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Driving Dave Crazy,"I enjoyed it, but I would have liked it done in animation format, like Sequel and Chipwrecked. I think it would have been even better."
2,What a Disappointment!,"After listening to the soundtrack from ""Oh, Brother etc"" and the sequel ""down from the Mountain"" I thought I was in for more good old time bluegrass. Instead, this album is yet another slickly produced higly commercial mainstream Nashville glop. The only thing missing are the rhinestones. I should have known when I saw the record was produced by Ricky Skaggs -- mainstream Country music. Oh well, live and learn"
5,Just what I wanted,"Im going to be preforming my first dance (actually 2 dances) and I needed a black crop top! This was the best price and it looks really cute on, Im tiny so if you order a small, make sure your ta ta's arnt big :) PLUS it got here in 2 days!! Great BUY !"
2,Not made in USA,"I purchased this with the idea that it was made in USA. I did a search for a made in USA rain gauge and this came up. It even stated something about it being made in USA in the description. It is NOT made in USA. It's an overpriced average rain gauge. The metal frame the glass sits in is extremely soft, and bends easily and will probably break easily as well. I would pass this one up."
4,works well but fit was off,"The muffler does its job, but the o-ring together with the with the resonator pipe (also new from Walker) pushed the connection up into the frame were it rattled constantly. There was plenty of room below the connection, so there was no need to be so close. Resolved the issue by removing the o-ring and using muffler cement, which kept the connection away from the frame."
3,Beware - This is an extended capacity battery!,"While it's not mentioned in the product description at all, this is an extended capacity battery and will protrude out of the back of your phone which will require a new battery cover plate. Although such a plate is included with the battery it made of extremely cheap feeling plastic and, to top it all off, it's black. That's right...black. Why on Earth would you make the cover black when the phone is silver? The battery itself appears to work just fine (hence the three star rating) but the poorly written product description is unacceptable. I now either have to pay to return it or buy a new case for my phone as it now doesn't fit in my old case."
5,Great reference material,"If you're wanting to design TTL circuits, this book will be a must. It has the pinouts and in-depth specifications for Texas Intruments Standard TTL, Schottky, and Low-Power Schottky digital logic chips. It would be great for a hobbyist, and a necessity for a developer using these chips. Keep in mind that this is strictly reference material, and not a book you'd just thumb through."
2,Face it: Photoshop is for specialists,"Although written specifically for folks like me -- dummies -- the book reveals that Photoshop bears a strong resemblance to my original IBM luggable computer of the early 80s: touchy, complicated and frustrating. Hello iPhoto!"
2,photoshop 7 for dummies,"When I ordered this book, I thought for sure that this book is what I was looking for to help me learn how to use Photoshop 7. I had difficulty in comprehending the content of the first 3 chapters. I came away feeling that this book was too difficult for me to understand. I have ordered another book and I hope I'll have better luck this time."
3,Something must be missing,"I needed to learn how to make banners so, I got myself this book, although I did not expect much from it. My husband showed me first steps and with the book, I was able to learn how to use Photoshop in a week. While the book is full of helpful information might not be anything but a very basic beginner guide how to use colors and what pixels are, but if you actually want to make good looking product this book by itself will not be enough."
4,it is an excellent guide,"this is the guide book I needed. too often manuals are too technically written, expressing the writers viewpoint without consideration forthe reader. this book doe stake the reader into consideration and is written in an easy-to-understand style."
1,Book Seems to Be for Different Product,"I'm so confused. I downloaded the latest free trial of Photoshop 7 element 7 and then went out and bought this book. But the menu items described in the book are not the menu items in the package. NOT EVEN CLOSE! I'm not sure what product this book is suppossed to be for, but it's not Photoshop 7."
2,Beats around the bush too much!!,"I wanted to learn Photoshop, not just be entertained. Had to get to page 20 something before any meat. Gave up and have a better book now."
4,"So far, so good!","I'm only a few chapters into this book, but so far I'm really enjoying it both for the readability and the information. I have average computer skills: I recognize the usual icons in Photoshop (eraser, crop, etc) but I have no clue what to do when it comes to layers. This book is written both for Windows and Macs and so far everything (words and pictures) have matched up perfectly to what I see on the screen (I use a Mac). I suggest reading this book while you have Photoshop open...it'll make much more sense!I also bought another Photoshop book- Adobe Classroom. Although it looks like it has much more technical information, it was so technical that I couldn't even get myself to slog through it. If you want a starter course in Photoshop, grab this Dummies book! (PS- The 4 stars is only because I haven't completed the book yet.)"
2,A Little Too Advanced...,"I have always loved the Dummies Series and I will continue to purchase these informative books in the future; However, if you are not familliar with Photoshop to begin with, it's not the best choice.A lot of the book refers back to previous editions of Photoshop, but the authors swing from one side to another - either thinking that the reader is using a computer for the very first time, or have just purchased 7.0 as an upgrade.There is no middle ground for folks who have a solid computer background but just need to know what all the Photoshop options and icons do. Way too much of one chapter is dedicated to changing how the main screen is configured.I would say anyone who is a complete computer novice, yet managed to have moderate usage of the previous PhotoShop versions should benefit from this book.(And I hate it when authors offer to give a hint, but only if you purchase their OTHER book...)"
2,Photoshop 7 for Dummies,"Reads like stereo instructions. Too many technical graphics terms for a novice photo editor. I usually like the ""for dummies"" books but this one falls way short of the mark. I would recomend this book only to a seasoned graphic artist that was already familiar with the terminology."
3,Assumes too much,"In some parts they assume to much, it misses steps or suddenly introduces new words out of nowhere as if you knew the program. The other thing that its not visual at all, a ton of things could have been explained much easier and faster using visuals.I mean I did find it useful but probably because I read it all, however it was kind of annoying how they tend to forget who their audience is."
5,Substance abuse books,"This is truly a well written book, I had to purchase it for a class. The shipping was absolutely great!"
3,Dance Mixed Grace,"For Kelly Rowland, she had a lot more to prove for her solo work as a member of Destiny's Child, than any other member, especially Beyonce. Still, she was a little bit able to make her own feel from the experience. Her second single, Can't Nobody, is a little less catchy and meaningful, than her previous hit Stole. Although the beat was right, the song really almost sounded like another Destiny's Child song. Still, it remains just as a first try for Kelly on her own. Right now, she should try to rethink about being a part Destiny's Child all over again. They need to be a team again, and score those massive hit dance tracks."
5,Very enjoyable read!,"I immensely enjoyed this book. After reading the last negative review on this title, I had to put in my support for this title. I liked Ms. Dolan's characters and found them immediately appealing. I admit the storyline was not all that realistic, but I liked the adventure aspect. Ms. Dolan reminds me a bit of Carla Kelly's characters, in that they are truly unique, three dimensional, and very memorable. This one will be a keeper on my shelves."
3,its ok,"This cd is ok. Well.. There are some nice song like Send Me An Angel(but its kinda girly though) and there are some not that great song.I think this Cd is worth buying but if your in a poor situation when your girlfriend's birthday have just passed like me, you'd wish you didn't buy it."
5,"Great oil for massage, relaxation & respiration!","My masseuse recommended this oil for massage and when you have a cold. I use it on my daughter's tender ankle (from previous injury) and seems to soothe her every time. I hurt my elbow's tendon and it hurt all day when I moved my arm. I massaged this oil around my elbow one night and the pain was pretty much gone the next day, what a difference! I also had a cough one night when I was sleeping, put a little drop of olbas on my finger and rubbed it around my nostrils and inhaled it in a few times, it felt great in my chest and the next day the cough is gone. My masseuse also recommended to put drops of this oil in a bowl of hot water and cover your head with a towel and breathe the steam in. Overall, it's a must in my medicine cabinet!"
5,Even better than the original,"Much as I love the original ""Morris On"" album, the follow up is even better. Another key item in the Ashley Hutchings discography, it features an all-star cast including several people who would form one of the strongest lineups of the Albion Band. Richly varied and recommended to fans of Fairport and the Albions."
3,ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS,"For the price, it needed to be longer. All in all, I enjoyed it. I wondered why the camera was moving at times when he was supposed to be alone."
5,I bought these for my husband...,"and he loves them! he got inspired by mr. P and told me if i ever pissed him off, he was going to Alaska and build his own cabin...I told him it was ok if he went, as long as he left the credit cards! LOL"
2,"Content is great, shipping is lousy","I really enjoyed the portions of this I saw on PBS so I ordered the complete set. I was a little hesitant due to the high price but given the seller was the son of the filmmaker, I felt it would be worth it. While the content is great, the shipping was unacceptable. The 4 DVD cases were just put in a simple paper envelope and mailed. Every DVD case I received was broken and even the paper covers inside the clear wrapper were damaged."
3,Only buy alone in the wilderness part one and two!,"Alone in the wilderness part one and two is very very good! I recommend it to anyone and everyone loves the outdoors and getting back to basics.But please note the other two movies in this four Pack, were not very interesting. And the other two movies were mostly made up of scenes you see in the alone in the wilderness movies.But I guess they were still pretty good... Just my personal preference, I didn't really like them..."
4,Not long enough,This is a fascinating account of this man's journey in the wilderness. His ingenuity and smarts are inspiring. I just wish it were longer. You figure after 35 years in the wilderness alone he must have had extensive video footage and journals. The more the better about his many adventures. I was able to see most of this footage on youtube. The videos did offer quite a bit of additional detail which was nice though..
4,Engaging story - great scenery,"This is a terrific story. However, it can't be as easy as ol' Dick made it look. Enjoy the story and dream of an adventure of your own."
1,NOT the HBO version,This sucks bad. It is NOT the version used on the Sopranos. There are a lot more lyrics and the performers don't sound anything like the HBO version by A3. Don't waste your money.
2,Not the most likeable heroine...,"I am the first to admit to being a chick-lit fan, of the American and British variety, but I didn't like this heroine at all. Maybe I'm too used to the standard formula as in a recent read ""Jemima J"" by Jane Green which I loved, but there was nothing ""vulnerable"" about this heroine and instead of trying to find love AND lose her ""accidental"" virginity simultaneously, she seemed willing to sleep with anyone and damn the consequences. Not too too sympathetic a character to me...the ""hero"" in this story didn't grab me and the ending seemed way too contrived to be funny. This is not one of my must-reads, I'm sorry to say."
1,"thank goodness i didn't pay for this ""smut!""","This book is possibly the worst book I have ever read. The content tends to be unbelievable, and all too often i saw myself skimming a page just so I could finally get the end. I shouldn't have even done that, however, since the end was so awful. It was completely obvious that the author just wanted to wrap everything up in a neat bow, even if it ended up being totally ridiculous."
4,"Not a giftee for Grandma, however...","At the time of my writing this review, there were 51 reviews submitted. Those of you that basically enjoyed the book are to be applauded. Those of you that BOUGHT the book and are shocked, freaked, ""yucked"", or disappointed make me wonder... did you bother to read the introduction?This funny, light and humorous book with interesting characters has an unbelievable plot and a main character that continually makes a fool of herself. If you're looking for deep, meaningful stuff, this is not the book for you. I spent a couple of hours shaking my head, having laugh-out-loud moments and shocked silly sometimes, but was never bored. The characters are interesting and Stacy's almost sexcapades along with her frenzied lifestyle will be hard to imagine, however you can't beat a laugh-out-loud moment. Sure, it was a wee bit tacky, but I'm open-minded enough to appreciate the author's ""trendy"" fiction. Just another era we live in.Valerie Frankel is a great author"
1,I Can't Believe It Got Published!,"Unrealistic. Immature. Raunchy. Shallow. Each and every character is so ridiculously unscrupulous they seem like parodies of themselves. The heroine's character is largely inconsistent and a bit hard to stomach, much less sympathize with. The ending is so unrealistic and ridiculous that I wished I had followed my instincts and trashed the book by the 2nd chapter.And what on earth is with all the parenthesis? Every other sentence was in parenthesis. I'm still having nightmares about giant parenthesis invading the planet. Who publishes such sloppy writing? *Shaking head in bewildered disgust*This was my first Valerie Frankel book and needless to say it will be my last.I would have rated it Minus one star but unfortunately that option is not available. So, much to my chagrin, I had to give it one star, a very undeserved one."
3,"Fast read, familiar story","I call books like this, ""the bridget jones books"". I read these between the heavier books I read. They follow the similar pattern of career girl in the city in search of love and sex, most don't quite live up to the calibre of the original ""bridget jones"", but they try.This book was a fast read and had some funny moments. The end is extremely far fetched. The story was not good, it was not bad, it was average. If you want a quick, mindless read, this book fits the bill."
2,Breezy yet monotonous,This book was a fast read for me but 3/4 through I was getting annoyed with the redundant story line. The ending kept me going and it turned out to be lacking in my opinion. This is a nice & quick beach read but don't expect too much. I enjoy the open and sexy style but the storyline could have been better.
1,Not worth it,"At sparse moments entertaining, more frequently offensive, the premise is silly and inane. The last chapter is unbelievably ludicrous. I like books and heroines that I can somewhat relate to, and this doesn't even come close."
2,Shallow - even for chick lit,"Stacey hadn't had sex in almost a year. This hadn't bothered her, until a friend sends her an article calling women like her 'born again virgins'. What must a girl do? Have sex ASAP of course! From a casual date she doesn't like, or her ex, her closest male friend, her boss's son, or even by a female co worker.The workplace situations were mildly funny, but not very original. The motivation for the 'desperate sex' on the other hand, was very unclear."
2,Waste of Time,"Well, I really excpected this book to be funnier and more entertaining. I agree with some of you who've posted a review, after awhile, the frantic look to have sex with anyone, anyplace, anytime became quite dull. The end is absolutely stupid, unless she's having a dream and the author doesn't tell. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,A so-so read,"I just recently finished ""The Accidental Virgin"". It was nothing special. I really wanted to like it but Stacy and her thing about not becoming a virgin just became just too much. The story could have been really good if dealt with differently but the author just made Stacy so desperate. No wonder she had such difficultly finding a man, her desperation must have some level scared them off. Like some of the other reviewers on here, I wondered what exactly was her reasoning for her not to become ""revirginized"". Why was it so important? I really wished that this was explained.If anything, it showed Stacy to be a shallow person and not very likeable. The author's writing and phrasing was really good and probably the only reason that I kept reading. So I will read another book by Valerie Frankel and hope that the story is better than this."
2,too desperate,"the character was just too immature, a grown young independent woman, i just can't see it being possible. i didn't really like end either"
2,"Simple, Fun Read","I bought this book on a whim in a bookstore, and finished it within a day. It's the story of Stacey Temple, a 32 year old woman on the verge of becoming a virgin again. After reading an article on the internet describing how women can be ""revirginized"" after a year without sexual contact, Stacey goes on a mission to keep herself from being stigmatized with this title. She will stop at nothing, humiliation included, to be with SOME man before her year is up.I found the book to be pretty unrealistic, yet very light-hearted and humorous. It's a very fast, easy read that will keep you somewhat entertained from cover to cover. Frankel's witty sarcasm is excellent, and the storyline, though far-fetched, is sure to grasp anyones attention. Only worth the cover price if you don't expect it to be a ""deep"" and realistic piece of literature."
2,Completely unbelievable,"The idea behind this book is very cute, but the execution could have been so much better. The characters -- including Stacy Temple, the protagonist -- were totally flat and stereotypical. I didn't believe that any of them really existed for a minute. The plot was so predictable and ridiculous that it seemed Ms. Frankel wrote the book in one sitting with the very first ideas that popped into her head. This was not among the best of the chick lit category."
3,Oh so disappointing....,"I thought this book sounded like a great one, but I was so disappointed! I was so amused about the one year dry spell, but when a lesbian experience comes along, I was pushed over the edge. It was very over-the-top unbelievable and a tough book to finish. I am a huge fan a chic-lit and love the realistic chase of the ""right man"", but this one just didn't do it for me."
4,Interesting &#65533; Fun &#65533; Quick Read,If you are looking for a fun quick read this book is for you. The characters are interesting enough that you will keep flipping pages and it is written such that in a couple of hours you can finish it. The Accidental Virgin is exactly what the title implies. The story of Stacey Temple a designer for thongs.com who has found herself in the predicament of going almost 1 year without having sex. The story that ensues is her desperate attempt to find any person in New York who will have sex with her. This turns out to be a much harder task than originally thought. I laughed out-loud at a lot of the ?encounters? Stacey has. You will love this tail of sex ? not love!
2,High hope squashed,"I had really high hopes for this book but after reading it through, it wasn't as funny or hilarious as it claims to be. Some of the one-liner or sacastic remarks were predictable and the plots were unsatisfying. Better to skip this book if you're looking for a single chick revelations, otherwise, just another book to pass time while on the train."
4,Beguiling,I read this book several years ago and just rediscovered it and ordered it for my Kindle. I love that I can't relate to the main character Stacey and the hilarious ideas she has are non far fetched for the imaginative business woman of today.
1,Pink of Cheek? Oh dear...,"Now before you all start calling me a prude, keep in mind that John Waters' Pink Flamingos is one of my all-time favorite movies. It wasn't the sex that turned me off to this book, it was the distant and rushed writing style. Just because it's chick lit doesn't give the author an excuse to dash off a tell-don't-show borefest.When the book opened with a description for Stacy being ""pink of cheek"" I should've known better than to keep reading. Just struck me as hackneyed. Also, the sex (or almost-sex) scenes read as Tab A into Slot B and did very little to tittilate. I honestly don't know why anyone would think this book is funny."
4,Cool toy - needs more parts,"This is pretty cool. I did not get the same box as shown in the picture, rather the box I received was much smaller then pictured. You really need a few boxes to build anything cool. That being said, the toy is pretty fun if you like building things. I got a few for my nieces but not I want to buy one for my desk at work!. A few pieces in the kit seemed no not be as magnetic as others, but that wasn't a huge deal. Still a little expensive for what you get though."
3,"Good flavor, but chewy!","Bought these for a reptile party and did not need them all, so was able to sample a package. There are about 18 snakes per package, each snake is two-tone in clear, bright colors and about 4.5 inches long. They have two little eyes and a squiggly line up the back. I expected them to be softer, but found them a little tough and chewy. They taste great, though and my 8 year old enjoyed them so I suppose that is the truest test!"
4,Surprise!,"I have a lot of books but learned so much from this one that was completely new to me. Lots of great foundational truth for jewelry making; lots of inspiration to go off in your own direction; lots of information on how to get there. Some but not a lot of step-by-step projects to copy, more like a ""user's manual"" for tools and materials, with an eye on good design principles. Lots of info on wire-work which I'm shocked to discover is almost as addicting as the beads themselves!"
4,Good mystery,"In this novel, Lynda Curnyn takes us to Fire Island, where three friends named Zoe, Sage, and Nick are sharing a beach house with clothing magnate Tom. Early in the story, Zoe finds the mistress of the house dead in the water. The police department doesn't expend too much energy on her death, so kind-hearted Zoe, haunted by the incident, decides to explore it further.I agree with the other customer reviewers who said that Sage and Nick were selfish and unlikable. Zoe is the only character who cares about anyone other than herself. Nick is particularly oafish and annoying, although he redeems himself a little by the end, and I'm not sure why his point of view was included.The shifts in point of view - among Zoe, Nick, Sage, and the dead woman, Maggie - are confusing, although including a dead woman's voice is a neat trick. I would have eliminated a good 50-75 pages (including all the parts narrated by Nick) for a trimmer, leaner mystery, but the writing itself was light and enjoyable."
2,"Great storyline, horrible characters & jumpy first-person view points","This is one of those books which I found hard to get involved in the book simply because the way the story was written. Each chapter is written from a different character's (first person) point of view, which gets confusing and impedes the flow of the storyline. Like other readers, I often would have to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to see which character was talking. Very confusing!Other than Zoe, who is still has a personality of a wet noodle, none of the other characters are likeable (Sage is a trampy, self-centered character with no positive personality traits). How these three individuals became close friends is a mystery in itself, because of their own selfishness they make terrible friends."
1,Orbee Tuff Ball w/Roge,"Nice ball but rope came out of holes on the first day and there's no way to secure the rope back in the holes. Ball works best and tosses farther with rope. No rope, no fun."
1,Worst pedal effect sound ever....,"This product was the worst pedal effect that I ever bought in my life. Even if you put the knob in ZERO..Is a totally mess of sounds,Trebles, Bass, Mids...the good sound was tranformed in terrible specially with the distortion. In less than 48 hours I sold, I don't recomend this product. The classic (vintage) version or the phase 100 could it be better, but forget about this product. If you check at you tube you can find than 90% of this product are modifiedGuillermoVery dissapointedMusician and producer"
4,Simple and effective,"As the other reviewer pointed out, modern effects processors just don't get phasers (or really any modulation) right. You absolutely need this for an authentic early Pink Floyd sound (before Gilmour switched to a EM Flanger around time of the Animals tour). There is a very simple mod to make sound a little more like the classic ""Script Logo"" version that involves cutting one resistor. I prefer the sound that way, but even stock this is a great little effect that does one thing and does it well."
2,A disappointment,"You'd think mxr would make a phaser as good as its namesake ... sorry. Obvioulsy, when they sold out to Dunlop, something didn't go right .... THIS phase 90 is a very aggressive 4 stage phaser that adds heaps of distortion. If that's what you're going for, then sure go ahead buy it. But if you're looking for creamy sweeps look elsewhere, perhaps the script logo version, or a small stone, or even the BBE Soul Vibe, but this is a phase 90 in name only. I give it two stars because someone may want this kind of sound."
3,(Old circuit was an) Irreplaceable Classic,"Absolutely Obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock--1970's influences. I would probably buy the Phase 100 today though, as it has 4 different positions to choose from, I assume including the original set-up as one of them.Well, I need to correct this. This review was for the OLD models. The NEW models have FAR too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified. I thought I was replacing an old model with the NEW one, but alas the NEW is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!I will probably get an EH Small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too. Sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care ONLY about the bottom line and NOT enough, if AT ALL about the sound/quality of their products. The capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live. God help us!"
2,NO JUSTICE,"THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAKES ON THIS C.D. DO NO JUSTICE TO JOHHNY PAYCHECK'S MUSIC. I HAD TO COVER MY EARS WHEN I HEARD ""I'M THE ONLY HELL MY MOMMA EVER RAISED"" CAME ON. DID SOME OF THESE""ARTISTS"" GET PAID FOR DOING THIS? THIS IS NO TRIBUTE AT ALL."
5,If this doesn't touch your heart - you're probably dead.,"Often with tribute CDs, there are a couple of tracks and too much filler - with this Robbie Fulks-produced tribute to the late, great Johnny Paycheck, the opposite is true. From the opening blast of honky tonk - Neko Case's searing ""If I'm gonna sink (I might as well go to the bottom)"" through the twilight tones of Dallas Wayne, the sweetly guttural growl of Bobby Bare Jnr, all the way to Larry Cordle's beautifully melancholic ""Old Violin"" this CD packs a punch all the way. Want to turn someone onto Johnny Paycheck? - buy them this CD. Want to turn someone onto country music? - buy them this CD."
5,Motion detected!,"I purchased this item for my guest powder bathroom. The dimmer switch I had gave my guests trouble. After installing the new motion detector switch, the light comes on as you enter the room and my guests as well as myself enjoy the effortlessness of the product. I have had no problems and would highly recommend this product."
2,Motion Sensing Switch Stopped Almost Immediately,"I intalled the switch easily and set it. Then, after about 4 hours it stopped working. First, it would hardly detect any motion. Next, the switch stopped automatically turning off the light."
2,Not For A Casual Stroll,"For what it is, Atlanta Walks is a decent book with good maps and useful information on area sites. However, before you buy it know that most of these walks are around 5 miles long! To me, this is mostly for avid, athletic walkers and cyclists, not casual sightseers. I checked this out at the bookstore before purchasing it and was glad I did. I hoped to find more urban walks (no Cabbagetown, no Grant Park) and hoped they would be in the 1- to 2-mile range, highlighting more shopping and sightseeing opportunities. This is less for someone who wants to explore Atlanta, and more for someone who wants to exercise in an urban environment."
3,Not too good Not bad at all,The cufflinks came in the exact same shape as advertised and the quality looks pretty good too. The downside is that the size of the shape is a little big for my taste it takes away any stylish look
2,Not what you think.,continuous shot film of a guy going crazy that's pretty much it.I thought you actually got to see him hunt down & kill his viewers but you don't sadly
4,The Guns of Will Sonnett,"I really enjoyed seeing this old classic , now I 'll have to order more episodes !"
5,very cute,"very cute pair of stud earrings, i was afraid that they would be too small, but they were just perfect"
5,Upon meeting Jack Prelutsky,We live in Paris (France) and Jack Prelutsky has spent a few days speaking to the children at my daughter's school. He has made such a positive impression on her that I am going to order his books. He truly knows how to write for children.
4,Turn up the Bass!,This Cd will keep electronica lovers jamming. Atomic Hi-Fi has some great bass beats. It is an overall good cd and I recomend it to anyone who likes electronica and hard bass beats.
1,"Sloppy editing, details glossed over","Though the book covers material quickly and lucidly, the editing is very sloppy and key details are omitted. For example, in discussing using the ID datatype for attributes in DTDs, it omits a key detail: a number isn't an XML name, and to get around this, prepend an _. The example given even shows a useage that won't work! The O'Reilly book of a classmate included this. Elsewhere the text discusses examples that aren't in the book and seem left over from a previous edition, and reading the text is distracting for the grammatical errors.In general it appears that the book was thrown together in a big hurry, which is a shame, as it's a very likeable book and would be great if the information was correct."
5,Exodus: Interpretation Bible Studies,This is a good study for lay people with solid scholarship behind it. The author gives good background material and asks thought provoking questions. This is great for small groups.
4,"Rausch's ""Who is Jesus?""","I was introduced to this work as a textbook for a graduate course in Christology, but it's not a terribly difficult read even though it covers some pretty dense theology. Rausch provides some excellent historical background and comes at the subject from different perspectives so that it's a pretty good reference work. However, because it challenges the reader to consider somewhat deeper concepts beyond the simple, classical ""Christ died for our sins"" it may not be appropriate for people who are not already well grounded in their faith. Certainly a fine college level text book, I could see how it might also be used by a small faith group whose members want to challenge themselves to understand more deeply the Jesus of history, and how the church came to understand the meaning of the Incarnation over its first five centuries."
5,Who is Jesus?,Having a better understanding of who Christ is in relation to the four Holy Gospels. Living your Spirituality out in life as Christ's true disciples and servants in our daily lives.
5,one of his best,"This is a favorite of mine. My daughter had an outdoor wedding two years ago and George Strait music was played for all the dance music. This album was a particular favorite with ""I'm Never Gonna Let You Go"" being played for the bride and groom's first dance. Thus the album will always hold a special place in my heart."
5,The best,"I just love George, in any way shape or form. 9 concerts and can hardly wait for the next. But this by far is my favorite cd. Old tried and true pure George."
4,Very easy,"This was very simple to screw into the ground, and we have ground like concrete where I am. The only thing I have found, even though it has the swiveling loop where you clip the chain to, the dog still gets tangles where she ends up having 5 feet of chain instead of 40 feet because its all tangled around the stake"
5,God Bless This Company!,I am a loyal user of Newman's Own and Newman's Own Organics. This is a fun cookbook. My daughter and I enjoyed making the Jack in the Beanstalk Soup. It is nice to have a cookbook including so many of the Newman products. Lemonade Chicken Wings? Very tasty and a nice variety from the spicy.Congratualtions Mr Newman. I hope this book makes the kids a lot of money!
1,Piece of Sh*t - Giant Paper Weight,"Don't waste your precious time and money on any brother products.I did - learn from my mistake. Purchased a Borther MFC from staples. In 13 months, the printerhead malfunctioned. Called Brother to see course of action - said nothing I can do. Further research revealled that Brother new of defective printer heads but hid it from public. Called Brother again with this information - they said they would pay for the new printer head if I take it to an authorized Brother dealer. Wasted fuel to drive to an authorized dealer - 8 weeks later, with the new printer head installed - the dealer adviced that other error codes in the machine would not make the printer work. The auhorized dealer now no longer repairs Brothers due to very poor customer service. Even the dealer told me that the printer requires replacing not fixing but Brother told me to take it to another authorized dealer.Don't waste your time get a Canon MP780 instead"
4,"More than I expected, as much as I wanted","For a Mac user, this is a fine mulit-function machine. The software drivers for the printer's less-used preferences are a little off, but the fax is fast, the scanner communicates with every application to which I've linked it, the printer is as good as any I've seen for the money (or more). My only complaint is the orientation of the paper delivery, and the fact that after a few copies or faxes start to pile up, the floor's where they finally rest. That part could use some help. It's too soon to tell whether it's an ink-hog, but I'm very happy with it."
3,Comfortable day wear,"National's products are only middle quality, not as durable or well made as they could be, but acceptable for daily comfort wear and convenience."
3,Well......not a serious book.,"This book is funny, and the material is easy to grasp, but there isn't a lot of material. If you're a hobby programmer, then do buy iy, but if you're interested in programming for living, you shouldn't spend your time. I didn't. I've been learning 5 month, and I know enough C\C++ to start working."
5,Great for the price,A nice balsamic for the price point. Great in salad dressings. I even dip carrots and celery in it to make a veggie snack more interesting. Helps to make low calorie eating less boring. Sent some to my sister too and she loved it.
3,Just average,It was complicated for a drinking game. Not as many games as I thought there would be. Not the best.
1,This Product Is A Waste,"I purchased a FURemover from Organize-It. They shipped immediately.I have three dogs that produce a fair amount of hair. The house has a low pile carpet and I live in a low humidity area. The first attempt, at hair removal, picked up about 15 hairs. There was no balling or clumping. The hair did not move. I tried the FURemover on three separate occasions, in different parts of the house. The blade end did not better.I did have hopes the rubber blade would be useful for cleaning windows. I was wrong.The only useful part of the product is the adjustable handle."
2,Not good,"Got it for the pet hair on my rug, doesn't touch it. Tried it outside, I have no use for this at all."
2,Not a total waste but still....,The broom isn't a total waste of money but I can't say it does what its advertised to do either. First the telescoping handle is awful it does not lock in place and so it almost renders the broom useless. I tried to use it and it would collapse over and over. Second the broom head does seem to do the job but not as easily as they would make it seem. It takes a lot of elbow grease and muscle to get results. In the end I had to go out and buy a regular broom just so I could use the handle with the head for the FURemover. I think I may have been better off on my hands and knees with a damp sponge. Just as much work for less money.
1,Didn't work for me,"It could be my seaside location -- humidity (assuming it works on static electricity). However, it didn't work at all. I was amazed to see others rated it well. My guess, if you live in a foggy place -- it simply isn't going to work"
4,Useful!,"I was dubious, but, it works really well for cleaning my very short pile carpet. I've been trying forever to find a way to get long hair up when vacuums and tape and everything else was just not doing it. It does take a little elbow grease, and patience figuring out the best stroke direction, but after that, I got the hang of it!"
2,Not so great,"I had high hopes for this item. A couple people told me about carpet ""combs"" that were fantastic for getting fur from carpets. I don't think I bought the right one. While the flexible rubber teeth do grab fur, the fur curls up & drops off. I still can't figure out whether it works better pushed in one direction or two. It seems to do better with firm, short scrubbing-like strokes, but the hair lies in clumps on the carpet.I also find it very difficult to clean. I pull out the fur, but lots of ""stuff"" sticks to the rubber. The only way I've been able to get it off is to wash it; of course then you have a real mess to clean up ... and prevent from going down the drain.All-in-all, had I tried it before buying it, I wouldn't have."
1,The Front Page,Regrettably I did not like this play and did not finish reading the whole thing. It is very dated so I gave up on it fairly soon.
5,I highly recommend this one,"I first ordered a copy of this for my daughter when she was 9. She didn't actually get into it until she was about 10, but I have noticed her going back to that book over and over again. She asks questions, and it has opened up the way for a lot of discussion. Everything is in it from manners to clothes to making new friends to schoolwork and bras. It's all in a neat organized manner and written so it's easily understood and followed. I bought another copy for a friend's daughter, too."
4,From a Coastie Cadet,"As a third-year Cadet at the Coast Guard Academy, I read many books on leadership and I have to say that this is one of the best I have encountered. This book has taught me a great deal about my own institution and helped me to see exactly how my experiences have related to leadership. I would definitely say that I am a more effective leader after reading this book. I recommend it to anyone who aspires to leadership and wholeheartedly to anyone interested in our nation's 5 federal service academies."
2,So So,I found the book to be disappointing enough to write this because I am cheesed off enough for having somewhat wasted my money. It was quite boring and I didn't like the ego of the author setting himself up as the paradigm.
2,Absolutely nothing new,"This book seems more like an advertisement for the author being Mr. Perfect Leader than any kind of useful. There are a lot of good connections between successful military leadership and business leadership so the fact that he has to strain so much to make them is surprising. The book is poorly organized and not informative or inspiring. The thing is that I think he probably could have come up with a decent book if he had gotten himself more out of the picture and used more/better real world example from cadet life or the military. This book almost reads like a travel brochure written by someone who hasn't been there. It's a shame because the subject is a rich one and could have been done very well in the right hands.Having been ""taught"" Leadership by COL Donnithorne as a cadet it was surprising to me that he felt qualified to write a book on the subject. He did and the result is what one would predict."
5,A Must-Have!,"As a professional event planner, I completely support the motto embraced in ""InStyle Parties"" that ""entertaining should be, simply put, entertaining.""True to form, this well written book provides engaging and simple instructions on key entertaining elements including how to stock your bar (complete with cocktail recipes and money-saving tips), how to set your table, decor, music, flowers etc.Furthermore, the events spotlighted in the book run the gamut from seasonal dinner parties, to holiday fetes, to special occasion nights and summer parties.Last but certainly not least, ""InStyle Parties"" is rife with gorgeous photos, full recipes and a huge resource directory.I highly recommend ""InStyle Parties""."
1,Some day I'll throw a party like that!,"I have been reading Instyle magazine for a few years now. The first thing I always turn to in each issue is the Party Guide. As far back as 2002 I started tearing out the Party Guides, putting them in plastic sheet protectors and filing them in a binder to make my own cookbook. I flipped thru this book in the bookstore and it was exactly what I expected - Party Guides from 2003(Apr, Dec), 2004(Jan, Apr, Sept, Oct) and 2005(Apr, May, July, Sept) reprinted in a book. There were a couple that I didn't recognize, but I have different versions of the theme from other years. What I really wish Instyle would do is release another Special Issue on Entertaining like the one they did for the 2000 Holiday season. I refer to that one alot."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I couldn't wait to receive this book, today it finally came and I went thru it in about five minutes....yes it has some entertaining ideas and pictures(some) it just did not go into detail. You will be better off getting ideas from surfing the net. Save your money!!!"
2,"Nice sub with good bass extension to match LSI15's, but sucks for Home theater","1st one damaged, 2nd one dead in one minute. Even in working order this sub has too much port noise for serious HT use, sounds like broken plastic shaking and slamming against the wall. Use only if you want to listen to music or low volume HT. A Klipsch Sub-12 for half the cost would be better for HT use."
3,ok but...,"I bought this book to help with a college level English writing class. This book is ok, but its kind of wordy and dragged out. If your like me, an anxious reader, you want to get to the meat of the issue and get on with it. Not sit and read a long dragged out explanation of how and why."
4,Quite Good like a Condensed version of John Warriner's English Grammar and Composition Complete Book,"I was looking for a thorough American English grammar book to supplement my lessons when I taught SAT prep courses, and this came handy as it more or less summarizes the principles taught in John Warriner's high school English Grammar and Composition series. I considered myself extremely fortunate to have learned grammar from Warriner's books from Grades 7-12. Nothing explains the intricacies of American grammar better than Warriner's series when I consider the ways to explain to new generation of teenagers who need to understand grammar in order to pass the SAT. I also have The Grammar Bible, which more or less is a condensed version of Warriner's series."
4,The Only Grammar Book you'll Ever Need,"Good tool to be used for written works (reports, assignments, etc.)Is well recommended to whom use English as second language."
3,Bad Grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware.,"Only one of three examples of the past perfect on page 86 is correct, which is not surprising since the definition is incorrect. Correct examples do not flow easily from incorrect definitions, as one might expect. The example on page 89, ""George had got the pizza"", is also incorrect. You cannot make a past tense verb into a past perfect verb by putting 'had' in front of it. Page 185: ""The past perfect tense is used for a somewhat specialized purpose -- to emphasize that one past event occurred before a second more-recent event"" is wrong as can be. Page 319: ""The sentence, 'I had taken some pictures before the boat left', is in the past perfect tense."" Wrong. It only looks as if it's in the past perfect tense. You cannot make an irregular past tense verb into a past perfect verb by putting 'had' in front of it and forcing the irregular past participle. Trust this book if you want but do not trust what is written about the past perfect. Buyer beware."
1,Kindle edition not ready for prime time. February 2012,"I downloaded and used this book for about an hour. I found the organizational structure to be difficult to use, but one issue made me return it: it was not properly translated to the Kindle platform. There are many places where line breaks change the readability and content, and there are outright mistakes like missing underlines (Location 3743: ""Sometimes commas are required, but sometimes not, as seen here (adjectives underlined): We bought a large, expensive computer. Terrie is wearing a red cotton skirt."" Note the lack of underlining, just like in the Kindle edition). Compared to my 30-year-old copy of ""Handbook of Business English"" by Doris H. Whalen, this McGraw-Hill Handbook of English Grammar and Usage is very difficult to use (regardless of version: Kindle, paperback, etc.)"
3,An all-right book for an all-right price,"The book was pretty cheap, so I should've known it wouldn't be as good as the others I could've ordered. It's missing alot of things you would assume would be in a grammar book, so that was a little disappointing. My professor kept saying, ""Okay, look this up in the index of your grammar book"", and I would go to the index...and see nothing about it. I guess I was expecting too much for being able to save some money :/"
1,Not comprehensive enough for GMAT or TOEFL,"It's a nice book, but not if you are a foreigner applying to graduate schools in the USA. It does not have enough coverage and depth. For example, I didn't see anything about the perfect continuous tense, nor a detailed explanation on where each tense is used. Try ""English Grammar In Use"" by Raymond Murphy and ""Advanced Grammar in Use"" by Martin Hewings (with answers and CDROM) for grammar practice, and/or ""Practical English Usage"" 3rd ed. by Michael Swan for a comprehensive grammar reference. Good luck!!"
4,"anatomically graphic and erotic video,1st of 6","this video,the first of a series of six, by ron harris,is based on interviews with two aspiringmodels , and anatomically graphic sceens. with lots of nudity.the group sceens towards the begining and end , make use of a revolving white turntable.the video like others by ron harris, is shot against abright white background.erotic in a more basic way than many other videos."
5,"Evocative, funny - you can't resist it. Get it now!","'This Old Porch' alone is worth the price of the CD. I grew up 5 miles from that Brazos River (the bottom lands) he sings about, and this song captures the smell of enchiladas, cattle, and an old musty porch with cattle milling about. It's the real thing. Almost every song of the CD is a classic. A must-have for your collection if you are a fan."
4,Still Good Listening,"What can you say about Lyle, either you love him or not. This is the best I think, more upbeat, would be more complete if they added ""Thats right your not from Texas""...."
4,Sound is all relative,Placed one in garage and one in a commercial kitchen. Loud ticking sound is not a problem. For the money you can't go wrong. I also picked one up at a local Menard's store for about the same price < $5.00.
3,Works.,"Cheap plastic clock that works, not a piece of art or furniture, uses batteries, doesnt' do that well outside in cold weather., uses batteries quicker than I expected."
3,Loud !,"It keeps good time and it looks nice, but it is loud. The ticking can be heard many rooms away and so I have placed it in a room that is not often occupied. I much prefer my quiet clock. The smaller version of this clock is not as loud. I would not buy this one again. If you do not mind the loud ticking it would probably be okay. Conditionally Recommended."
2,Stopped working in less than a year,"This clock stopped working in less than a year. We changed the batteries a few times, but it still slowed way down. By the third time it made me late for work, we took it down."
1,TOO NOISY !,"THE CLICKING OF THIS CLOCK IS WAY TOO LOUD, IT MAKES FALLING ASLEEP DIFFICULT! I WOULD NOT SUGGEST TO ANYONE WHO WILL BE ANNOYED BY A TICKING SOUND, ITS PRETTY LOUD."
2,Look somewhere else,"I was going to return this clock because the PAPER interface was bend. I've never had a clock with paper interface that had the numbers for the time. It's very cheaply made but for a little over eight dollars so you really can't expect much. You pay a little, you'll get a little."
3,Geneva Wall Clock 8101,"This clock has a very nice, clear face. It has a loud ticking that I can hear in the room next to it and I wish I had known that. I don't know if there's a way to modify the noise. I really like the look of this clock and it's very light weight, therefore less likely to pull or sag a hanger off the wall."
2,Cheap and loud,"This clock came up when I searched for silent clock, but it clearly is not after getting it. If you plan to have it in a room rather than a wide open space, it will likely be too loud for use -- it was still audible 20 feet away.The clock was cheap to get, but it also is cheaply made and difficult to hang up -- I wish I had realized that before I bought it."
2,Piece of crap!,"I should have heeded the advice of the other reviews telling you that it looses time , because it does. The battery slot is sooo tight you think that you are putting the wrong size in. Ridiculous! very upset with amazon for stocking this junk! This clock is only 2 weeks old."
3,Too small,"Too small for the price you pay. I would suggest a price decrease. I guess the size s ok for traveling, but I would just order one thing bigger for that price."
1,Not a Good Scent,I was a little disappointed in the scent of this cologne. I am keeping it just because it is not the product fault just a preference problem.
3,Not What I Expected,Who knew that this was a version 3 not the new version 4? Not me. I thought the vendor just had a good price...but alas they were selling the old version -- which by the way works very well on non-Intel-based MACs.
4,A Practical Read to Empower Women,"I learned something useful about saying ""No"" just flipping through the pages. This is a helpful read for women who tend to resist saying a firm ""No"" and get over-committed. I like the comparison of Naysayers and No-Sayers (p. 76), the ""don't do"" list (p. 108), and the Taking Action and Discovery Questions at the end of each chapter. Could be a personal study guide or used in a group.Brenda Nixon, author of Parenting Power in the Early Years and The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
1,"too much, too boring",It's an excellent example of the monotone commentators of the 1950s public announcements. I used it in a classroom one time. It's a sloozer.
5,Beyond this World!!!,Words cannot describe the beauty and the mastery of Mr. Thielemans' music. He has once again expressed his soul through harmonica. Together with Kenny Werner this album took a totally indescribable shape. The music is beautiful beyond this world. If I could I would give it a million stars but even that would not describe my gratitude and appreciation for this music. It truly grabs your soul!!!
3,Cure for insomnia,"Listening to these great artists perform together is a treat, of course, but for me there was too little variety in the selections. I've learned to play this CD in installments; otherwise I get either depressed or sleepy. If you're hoping for either, this could be the CD for you. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere in Warner's and Thielemans' repertoires."
3,"good stories, poor dvd treatment","These are great stories with a new take on Roswell. Fun characters and cool aliens. I've enjoyed every story. But the production of the DVD is strictly amateur, including a TV channel icon in the corner of the screen that makes them appear just taped off TV. The cover says over 2 hours but with 5 episodes of 22 minutes a piece, that comes to under 2 hours. Each episode is interrupted several times by an annoying commercial break announcement. Furthermore, whenever I put in the dvd, it plays much louder than normal and has to be turned down. Nothing extra except commercials for other even lower budget dvd productions. There were allegedly 40 episodes produced. I'd like to see them all in one dvd box set, with the mistakes fixed."
5,LOVE...LOVE...LOVE IT :),"Oh How I have looked...and looked....and looked...for this music!I heard it years ago..especially around 1997....and certain songs have stuck out in my head...And I searched for them on the internet....over and over....And PRAISE GOD....I finally found them on this cd on Amazon! YAYYYYYY!This cd has REALLY blessed, encouraged, and cheered me up!It is WONDERFUL....The one that really deeply touches my spirit is ""Come Let Us Bow""....WOW....You will feel the presence of the LORD JESUS on this cd!Enjoy:)Oh yes...quick shipping, great company...just as it was described...great condition...no problems! :)"
5,Caravelle by Bulova 45C002,"I bought this watch at MyTimepiece (via Amazon.com). I live in the Netherlands and the shipping took 12 days (that's very fast for standard shipping). The watch itself is very nice. It looks excactly like the picture (and maybe even better). The watch is very light. I've got really small wrists, but after removing some links it still looks great. It's easy to remove links. I recommend this watch! It's a great quality/price ratio."
2,Did not work with my glasses,"It is unfortunate that these lenses do not work on any of the lenses I attempted to use them on.After failing to get them to work any other way, I even tried trimming them to fit my lenses better. Again to no avail.It is possible they may work in some application. Unfortunately I have yet to find one.Even if you can get them to adhere to a lens it would be very critical that there are no bubbles under the lens or the view would be very distorted.If you don't mind blowing the money on a set of these just to satisfy yourself that they will not work for your application, then by all means give them a shot. Just don't be surprised when they don't work."
5,Tomorrow Begins Today,"A must-have, must-read, must-share guide brimming with invaluable, life-changing, empowering information for women at every stage of life."
3,some what disappointed,"I love the earrings but wish they had been solid, rather then a cookie cutter cutout."
4,Clairvoyant in its depiction of politics and the media.,"Given everything that has happened in the media and on our political scene AFTER Racina's Hidden Agenda came out - it is chilling in its portrayals. An insider's view of the political scene and the media that surrounds it, nurtures it and feeds off it. Racina's insights and perceptions are amazing."
4,Too early to tell,"It's a bit too early to tell if this cartridge lasts as long as the Canon, but at this point we are very pleased with it's performance."
1,ink purchase,item did NOT work. lesson learned - buy cheap and risk getting something worthless. attempting to return item. what else can we say.
1,toner review,"bought two of these, dont waste your time the two I got when right back neither worked, had to take the time to rebox and call and get a tag BIG waste of time."
2,Canon E30 Compatible Laster Toner Cartridge,I ordered two cartridges and only one of them was the correct cartridge. The correct cartridge worked for a few copies and then it locked up and would not work. I replaced it with my old cartridge just to make sure that it wasn't the machine itself and the old cartridge I had worked fine. Defective product and the other cartridge being the wrong one wasn't the only thing that that made me unhappy. The company that sold it through Amazon I tried contacting via their contact information on their website and their phone number was not correct. Product is set to be returned via Amazon tomorrow.
1,defective,I had it for one week. It made a lot of noise while making copies. After one week it made a black line in the center of the page. I called to get the replacement. It was fast delivery. But the replacement had more defects. I couldn't make any copy at all. It made a lot of noise and a black line in the top and side of the page. No more replace for me. Refund only!
2,distribution block only,just a heads up the product does not come with fuses i thought it did but now i have to go order those too i suggest getting a different one that already has them.
2,bends easily,If the pin is easily removed this punch will be fine but if it is not easily removed for any reason then this pin punch will bend and break. I replaced the broken Dasco punch with one from Tekton which uses a stronger metal and resists bending much better.
2,Didn't Prevent Moles,Moles continue to burrow. I let my neighbor use about 1/2 the pail and he said he still has moles too. Just didn't work for us.I was skeptical since we have tried so many products. This is another on a long list of preventative measures that didn't work.
2,Very disappointing,"This memoir is one of the few books that recognizes and addresses the fact that men, as well as women, are afflicted with eating disorders. That fact alone makes it an important contribution to the literature available on this category of mental illness. While I admire the honesty of this book and the struggles of the author, I was disappointed that it was so poorly written. It was repetitive and the narrative just looped back on itself. Toward the end, Mr. Henning seemed most intent on promoting his Programs. I am sympathetic to the fact that this is how he makes his living, but the constant repetitious mention of his copyrighted ""Nutrition and Body Image Program"" and ""The 16 Points"" was distracting and tedious. I read the book with pencil in hand, underlining the most important thoughts and personal insights (there were many). I just wish Mr. Henning had hired a better editor."
5,Absolutely amazing!!,"This book was amazing in how it portrayed the struggles of an eating disorder and everything else that comes along with that. Although sometimes it was hard to handle the intensity of the issues, it would not have been the same without that intensity. Dennis did an amazing job at sharing his story and I know this book will be able to help others understand and learn and change their lives."
5,Self-Famine,"Dennis shares his pain and suffering from self-famine in such a courageous raw and vulnerable fashion. Unfotunately, so few men have shared their experience of suffering from eating disorder behavior and this book helps fill in much needed and long awaited personal recovery by a male. My hope is that his honnesty and life-learned wisdom can help others seek solutions to their own healing and perhaps along their journey, utilize some of Dennis's ideas as a template. I felt empathy, hope, and joy as Dennis shared his story of recovery.Michelle Matoff, LCSW, BCD"
4,"Pretty sick sounding, but where's 2113?","Who would know that an instrumental classical version of the progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria's second album would sound so awesome? It fits well as a complement to the album itself. Kudus to whoever made this. However, I'm only going to give it four stars because they left out 2113, which would have sounded great on a string quartet. Instead of that, they do their own original composition, but both songs would've fitted onto the CD. But regardless, it's a must."
1,An abomination,"It would take too long to detail what I detest about this ""recording"" and my outrage that I paid money for it. I am a passionate Bach devotee with hundreds of recordings; I was misled by endorsements of this disc in Newsweek and The Economist (I know, serves me right...) If you have any heart-felt appreciation of the greatest composer in history, steer clear of this monstrosity."
3,"Not bad, but not good, fun","In some ways this is an improvement over Goddess By Mistake, but in other ways it's not as good. The writing in this book was much more professional and improved. I thought the writing GBM was pretty amateurish. Unfortunately, the story in this book was pretty slow and hard to get interested in, whereas GBM moved quickly and pulled me in. At one point I realized I only had about 40 pages left but I almost had to force myself to finish.On the one hand, this book is fluffy, simple-minded entertainment (which can be a good thing) and the plot was pretty original. On the other hand, if you stop and think too much about how silly the characters and their actions are and how there is no depth behind anything, you might realize you just don't care too much about the story. But since this book shows some improvement over GBM, I'd like to think Cast's future books potentially could be even better and I'm looking foward to reading them."
3,Not the best P.C. has to offer...,"I'm a big P.C. Cast fan. I loved ""Goddess by Mistake"" and am looking forward to reading other books by her.This one however was...meh. It's classic P.C. that's for sure, mystical creatures, torrid love affairs, and classically unbelievable plots, but this one was just...I don't know...fluffy? Is that a good word?I expected it to be more ""Little Mermaid"" like, instead I got an air force gal who gets transformed into someone else...I don't know...Bottom line, it held my interest, but was hard to swallow, even for a high fantasy book...that says a lot.Two and a half stars."
1,couldnt make it through one chapter,"I had to stop reading this after I spend way too many pages reading about her talking outloud to HERSELF while alone in her house, that should be read as a thought process, not spoken aloud. I also thought it was completely unblievable that she joined the Air Froce even though she is terrified of flying. Who does that? She didn't come off as a real human and I couldn't believe any of it. I don't think I even made it through the first chapter because it was so terrible. I cant believe i spent 12.99 on this book."
3,So-So,The book was entertaining. Therer were a few parts that didn't seem to flow quite right but I did enjoy the ending.
3,Very Enjoyable!,"This book was much better than I expected it to be. A fine blending of modern, medieval, & mystic elements. The plot moved along very well and I found the ending to be very sweet and unexpected. I have wondered, though, as to why the mermaid on the cover has a pinkish/orangish tail when the heroine's tail is described as a beautiful blueish color. Oh well...If you'd like to read more mermaid novels, I recommendThe Last Mermaidby Shana Abe,The Mermaid's Songby Marianne Willman,Sleeping with the Fishes (Fred the Mermaid, Book 1) (Paranormal)by Mary Janice Dickinson. You may also enjoyThe Tower at Stony Woodby Patricia McKillip, which has mermaid-like people in it; and another book,The Changeling Sea (Firebird)by the same auther."
4,Gotta try it,"This is the first book I've read by P.C. Cast and am glad I picked it up. I would never have thought a mermaid romance would appeal to me, but Ms. Cast did her job well. I was shocked at the, well, erotic scenes that had the potential to be ""icky"". What goes where with mer-people? Why would I want to day-dream about a fish (ok... ok... mammal!)? Well, by the time I finished reading this book, I didn't care that Dylan had a tail. He had me a-day-dreaming all over the place.Goddess of the Sea is about a contemporary MSgt. in the USAF, CC, who survives a terrible plain crash only through the magic of the mermaid, Undine. They switch bodies, sending CC (now Undine) into an unknown world. Goddess is a contemporary, medieval, and paranormal romance all rolled into one imaginative story. Well done."
2,disappointing,"After I fell in love with her first book, ""Goddess By Mistake"" the waiting for her next book was difficult to say the least. ""Goddess Of The Sea"" is a big disappointment. The writing is different and the characters are boring. The humour is gone and the story is hard to swallow without it. Wherever you're hiding Ms. Cast please come back and write your own books!"
5,Love it!,"PC Cast's books are a mixture of magic, mythology and just good ol' girl power! Love them all and this is no exception!"
2,Weak,"As a fan of PC Cast, I was very disappointed with this book---so disappointed, I will not continue with the series. I love the fantasy genre but had to 'suspend reality' more times than I cared so the story would work. When CC's plane went down, for example, she seemed to embrace her new reality as if it was just a little vaca she could return from easily. This was not only another time but another realm! Just fit in without a look back--not very believable to me. Another example would be the little get togethers between the kitchen help and CC---as if the cackling and subterfuge would not be echoed throughout the stone monastery. Such a typical light-weight girl book. Too fluffy for me!She created a much richer, more believable alternative world in the House of Night series."
4,new twist on the little mermaid/non disney,This book was pretty good. It's a modern twist on the Little Mermaid Fairy Tale. (Not the Disney One) where the real Mermaid (or Mer-Man?) is the Hero and the human is the Heroine. Just enough sex to get you hot but still in the relm of what I consider young adult. It was a good read.
4,Awesome!!,This book was an amazing tale of a modern woman who just like the rest of us want a little magic in life. As a soldier myself I really could relate to this book and let my imagination wander...If only this could happen in real life I would be set :). This would of been a five star but it ended a little fast i really wanted to see what happened with Christine and Dylan.
1,don't waste your money.....,i didn't like this book at all. i had to force myself to finish it. i do enjoy her House of Night series she writes with her daughter Kristen.
3,AVERAGE SUMMERTIME FLUFF,"Those of you who are fans of GODDESS BY MISTAKE may find GODDESS OF THE SEA to be somewhat of a letdown. In many ways it is a lesser creation. It certainly isn't as funny as MISTAKE, the heroine just doesn't have that middle-aged, hard-bitten, man-eater feel. Nor does she have the same hilarious insights or snide asides. The plot is reasonably interesting although fairly obvious, can't say I was surprised by any part of the story, even the end. The female character is different enough from her first to be interesting but to be honest her main love interest is just another big mythical creature. Same ol', same ol'.So a total washout as a book? Not even close. It was still a fun read, quick and light with plenty of romance and magic. This would be a great book for the poolside this summer.While it's not quite up to the level of her first book I would still RECOMMEND it, just don't expect a repeat of MISTAKE."
1,Absolutely YUCKY !!,This is one of the WORST tasting RTD shakes ever !!! Can taste the chemicals so bad ... it tastes like medicine !! I think this much is enough said !!
5,As advertised!,I ordered a used copy of the Steely Dan's Greatest Hits. The CD arrived in good shape complete with all the original printed materials in the jewel case. I asked for basic shipping and the item arrived within the time window stated. I'm happy.
4,Hard to find Steely Dan Greatest Hits,"I heard a Steely Dan song on the radio and couldn't wait to get ahold of a CD. Unfortunately, it's hard to find an older group CD in the stores, so I searched on line and found this great buy! It took a little longer than I expected to get it, but when it arrived, I loved listening & remembering the good ole days!"
4,pop nostalgia,"Seems I can still remember SD with their signature rythm, when AM first brought us ""Do It Again"" in the '70s. Back then it was a wise move to stay hip with the innovative R&B sounds that so marked the greatest era of pop.Sounds were coming from every direction - jazz, rock, western - and new mixed with old as the century moved ahead in terms of traditional moods and new-born sensations.For this was a time of violence and experimentation, and SD certainly emulated the trends of the times with their own blend of electronic romp, night-club instrumental and ghetto librettos - as ""Reeling in the Years"", ""Bhodhisattva"", ""Here at the Western World"" and ""Kid Charlemagne"" energetically attest.non fin"
3,steely dan greatest hits,"I liked the music but the cd has one track that has not played well at all, because this song jumps all over and I foreword to the next song"
4,My First Taste of Genius!,"As a teenager in the 80's, I was familiar with several Steely Dan songs from the radio, but this LP was the first thing of theirs I bought, and it sold me for life. Objectively, this is a solid collection of their many hits and styles, but subjectively, this made me want to go out and buy every one of their albums, which I now have on CD. Their songs just might hold up better than other band I know (including Rush, my absolute favorite band). All I can say is that I will never get tired of listening to this music, since it was obviously built to last!!!"
3,Just ok...,"I am a magazine designer always on the lookout for new books addressing the topic. This one was...just ok. Most of the showcase designs are too abstract to really apply in most small publication markets. Not a total waste, but there are far better books on the topic (such as ""Suprise Me"" or ""Magazine Design That Works"")"
5,Streamlined way to Add some Color to a Room,"I live in a modest-sized apartment and needed a way to 'define' the dining space. My 'dining room' is also used to house a bar, shelves of dvd's, and a dart board (hey, I had to let the boyfriend save SOME of his stuff from being stored in the basement!)So for me...it was a nice way to section off the dining room table from the rest of the room. It looks a lot more expensive that what it was, which I like. Just as another review states: this does attract a LOT of pet hair (cat hair specifically). However I've had the rug about a year now and it has stood up to lots of vacumming. My cats have coughed up a few hairballs here & there on this rug, and it has never held any stains from them. This is a durable rug and it was an easy (and cheap!) way to class up the room!"
4,Pretty in Pink,"This is an interesting retrospective of ""The Pink Years"" - 1970 to 1973 - when TD was recording for the Ohr label. Material from the initial four albums, plus a 1973 track that was released in the 1980s, comprise the collection.Five of the six numbers appeared on Electronic Meditation (1970), Alpha Centauri (1971), Zeit (1972) and Atem (1973), with White Clouds included on Green Desert, a 1986 album of material recorded in 1973 and remixed later by Edgar Froese.By focusing on a specific era of the band's prolific career, the album is a nice gaze into the progression that ultimately led in 1974 to the classic Phaedra for Virgin Records."
4,nice seller,The Seller was very nice. He communicated me quickly and he does not leave a problem or a miscommunication behind. Thanks
1,John B. Turchin,"This is a well researched and very well written piece of serious work.The author does an excellent job with footnotes. However, the author seems to be limited by availability of research sources materials.Like many good works, it raises questions that beg to be answered:Why did Mr. and Mrs. Turchin have such stronge anti-slavery sentiments?What forces molded thier thinking?Who were they really?Nadine Turchin may even be more compelling than the general.A second book that leads upto where this work begins and covers a fuller treatment of Mrs. Turchin would be much desired. However, this may or may not be possible."
5,Love them!,"I love these pants. I use them in the gym a few times per week while lifting. My only problem is the length. I got the medium pants (I'm 5'10"") and I have to roll them up a bit otherwise they are walked on. The stitching is pretty solid as well, no fraying anywhere. Going to get another two or three pairs here soon. =)"
4,Good casual pant,"Love the way this pant fits in the waist and butt. However, the legs are too long and they seem to flare out like bell bottoms. After I cut off the extra three inches of material I think it will be perfect for a casual pant. Not fancy for a dinner night though."
4,Review of Karate Pants,I like the pants. Great material and stylish for multiple use. Stretch and moisture wicking. Just be aware they are long.
3,WAY TOO LONG,"Nice comfy material, but the pants were made for someone who was 6'3"" with a 30"" waist. So unless youre a tall skinny freak-a-zoid, you will have to get these hemmed like I did."
4,"Simple, compelling story for little ones","My young children loved this book. It has a simple, rhythmic story line that builds satisfyingly to an exciting conclusion, when the family finally pulls the huge potato out of the ground. The illustrations are lively and amusing. This book is just right for children under six. Personally, I even found the unembellished nature of the book refreshing, and I read lots of books to kids every day!"
1,Child's Book,There are two completely different books with this same name. This 1864 book is juvenile fiction. It is not an Apple family history. The latter book was published in 1991.
3,It is okay,"It works fine as long as I'm standing in an open area. On my walks where there may be trees, reception is interrrupted fequently. It definately beats nothing, but it is frustrating as most of my listening is on talk programming."
4,Delphi headphones.,I ordered these for my husband and he has not had a chanve to use them. They look like nice phones. Sorry I dont have any more to say.
4,Delphi Headset,"I waited a long time to purchase this until I found it on sale. Excellent quality construction and good reception, intermittant inside the house but not bad. Very good reception mowing the yard or laying in the hammock.Gave it 4 stars because the sound quality is very good but not great."
3,indoor usage,"This works fine outdoors, but I purchased it so I could use it in the house and be able to walk around. The MyFi unit only has an antenna that must be used by a window and plugged into the unit. If you only want to use it while you are out walking, it will work."
3,Too clumsy,While it was great to have a built-in antenna for the MyFi this unit is way to large and clumsy. I would have love one that had earbuds type speakers rather than the large ear covering ones.The sound is good and reception fine but just too large and old fashion type headset..
2,Cigar antenna works better,Reception on the factory enclosed cigar antenna worked far superior than this headset model.
1,Totally Uncomfortable,I never put on headphones that were so uncomfortable. I would recommend them to my worst enemy but probably no one else should buy the until they redesign them.
1,Misrepresented,This item appears to have been out of production for years. It does not work in the xm I have XMp3i. If all I wanted was earphones I could have gotten them much cheaper.
2,Very stiff,"I was expecting more of a flexible plastic. But like most things in life; you get what you pay for. These are thin, stiff, and make an ugly noise when they scrape, going over speed bumps. I would recommend, rallysport basic, for same price. Im sure their better."
5,Foods That Heal A Gude to Understanding and Using the Healin,Bernard Jensen is a brilliant and accredited nutritionist and natural healer. This book is an excellent source of nutritional information for the person who is willing to change their diet to understand that all ailments can be traced back to what we eat. Change your diet change your health. His philosophy is sound and scientifically accurate. You can make a difference in your health by choosing the correct foods. Food is the first medicine and Dr. Jensen describes the therapeutic values of many foods for specific ailments; lists nutrient availability of many foods and adds recipes to boot. This book is a must for anyone who is even contemplating natural healing or seeking preventive measures to ill health. Dr. Jensen is a gifted teacher and I highly recommend all of his published materials.
5,Health,This book may be older but the healthy principles remain the same. Great book for anyone wishing to improve their health.
5,masterpiece,Dr.Jensen is a great holistic nutrition scientist that cares about people and not corporations that bleed us dry with gimmicks theres very few nutritionists i trust my favorites are norman walker paul and patricia bragg arnold ehret ann wigmore charlotte gerson and bernard jensen those are the ones i trust be careful with anyone else unless they quote these folks!
3,"Annoying, but thought-provoking","This is an annoying, but thought-provoking book. It raises a number of important issues that merit discussion, but typically fails to resolve them. He is ignorant of anthropology. Anthropologists and National Geographic, he says, both do ethnography; ethnography is the study of rural Africa; and rural Africa is not the ""real Africa."" Yet Keim never says where this ""real Africa"" is to be found. His message seems to be ""everything you know about Africa is wrong."" I try to get my students to laugh at his rants, but they seem to have lost all patience with him."
2,be sincere in your dealings,It came in a cheap package.It says online that it was used but 95% good but it looked like a 45% good.considering the package and how they lied about how good the book looked I will not recommend to anyone unless they be sincere with their dealings.
1,lack of sutble inflections,"Music, electronic or not, becomes tiresome when there is no emphasis or acknowledgment given to dynamic changes or nuance. From the start of any given track, the tempo and dynamic is what you get. That's it... no inflection no expression. It makes one wonder if Mr. James simply programmed the tunes into a shareware midi sequencer and let it run it's course. There is no stimuli for the intransitive senses. However if you are looking for background sound, this may be it."
1,Together we're Worse,"Yuck, is all I have to say about this CD. If anyone out there is buying this CD because there's not enough of Steve Wilson's Porcupine Tree to purchase, STOP NOW. Together we're Stranger as a monotonous meandering of very dull music. Don't get me wrong. I am not a rocker who can't tollerate clever ambient music, but this music is so boring I can't believe Wilson would have any part of it. Once again, and this time with vigor, Yuck!"
3,"Beautiful, yet kind of dull.","I liked most of the previous No-Man releases, but this album is a remarkable departure. The instrumentation is very sparse and the album focuses a great deal of attention on the delicate, breathy vocal delivery. Unfortunatley I find this kind of vocal styling annoying, especially if it isn't accompanied by some form of music with dynamics. That's not to say all the music is dull and lifeless, Porcupine Tree mastermind Steven Wilson does manage to add some nice psychedelic textures to the songs. But that isn't enough to save this album from its own lack of weight. I'd recommend starting off with an album like ""Flowermouth""."
5,"Comforting ""Brown Kitty""","My 3 year old had one just like this since he was born, and then his father left it at a restaurant and he was devastated. The only place I could find it (an exact match from the one lost) was Amazon.com by Ty products. It's soft, fluffy, and he brings it everywhere. His name for it is ""Brown Kitty"" and it hold up wash after wash very well. It goes to daycare with him and he uses it as a pillow at nap time and nighttime. It's softness stays for years."
4,Forbidden love...,This was well written. I wanted to fast forward to the end so I could know what happened. This was a great love story that dealt with a great deal of issues. People do crazy things for love and these two definitely did.
5,Straightforward overview of the common challenges,"I have read the Chinese translation of the book. In fact, the translation is sold in a set of three different books. I have read them at different times. It provides direct and biblical insights into how Christians should view money, sex and power. Richard's writing is succinct. If you want to dive further into a topic, a rather extensive bibliography is provided."
1,Is it scriptural?,"In the preface the author states that God is not a male deity as opposed to a female diety. This to me was a red flag. The author has its own philosophy on what God is, God told us to refer to Him as ""Father"". I dont question God's word. This seems more like a book of man made philosophy peppersprayed with some truth than anything else."
2,not as simple as it sounds,"Read Foster's first book years ago, and knew he had some kind of mystical connection to God that I don't. So...since some friends voted we study this book, I bought ***ALL*** of Foster's works, including the Audible versions, study guides, journal, leaders guides, etc just so that I might find the right catalyst to pentrate my thick gray matter... but you know...this material is just not for my squirrely brain. It's just too Quaker, cerebral, Harvard or something. If you're from a high church background, it might be affirming to your convictions...but I'm a later addition to the Fold... and I need a more earthy language. Maybe Francis Frangipane, Danny Silk or Richard Rohr....or even Fred Luskin or Henri Nouwen...people who just keep love the focus. Simple for my simple brain. Still, it's worth reading for the few sentences that did penetrate. If you're ecumenically or cerbrally challenged like I am, just buy the Study Guide...it's the Cliff's Notes version."
5,Sturdy and cost effective,"I used this block to install two amplifiers in my Civic, and it works just as promised; turns one 4 gauge power cable into four 8 gauge leads. Not a bad looking little item, either. I couldn't believe the price in comparison to other similar items, and was sort of skeptical about the quality. Very happy to be proven wrong."
2,Not as pictured,"The item pictured has mounting screw holes on the side. The one delivered has holes right below where the wires go, makes it difficult to mount properly."
3,"Solid, but smaller ports than advertised.","This is a decent piece of hardware, especially for the price. However, when installing a pair of amps with KnuKonceptz 4-gauge wiring (I forget their marketing scheme, but it's the lower-end CCA cabling, not the OFC) I found that the input - which allegedly works with up to 4-gauge - is a bit smaller than that. The 8-gauge holes seemed to be fine, but I did use a different brand of cable known to be a bit on the thin side. The next time I purchase a distribution block, I'll definitely spend the extra few bucks and get a better product from a different manufacturer."
3,Not 4 gauge,"This products works as it should. However, the input side is NOT 4 gauge. As such, the coating on my 4 gauge power ""in"" wire does not go in the whole."
3,Pretty pictures,"The American Kennel Club (AKC) recommends this book. The first 50 pages of the 93-page book are dedicated to the history of the breed, characteristics and the AKC standard. The balance of the book contains good information about purchasing and preparing for your puppy. I already had a dog so this wasn't of much interest to me. In addition, there is some general care information (grooming, feeding & training). This portion did not go into great depth. There is a beautiful, glossy, color photo on all but 7 pages of the book. Really awesome pictures, adorable dogs. The back, inside cover has a picture of a dog with descriptions of all the dog's parts. Kind-of neat. I was hoping to get more care information. The approximately 1 page on grooming didn't suggest any type of brush, which is one thing I was looking for."
3,Just So So,"Hand Me Down does a fairly good job of keeping the reader interested and entertained. Anne, the main character of the novel, is just as plucky and humorous as the usual chick-lit heroines are. I thought the most interesting aspects of the novel were her relationships with her friends, dad, and, of course, her sisters. Her romantic relationship with Ian never really developed for me, and I can't say that I was really rooting for them to be together in the end. This is mainly becuase I had a little issue with the way they finally got together, which I won't go into so as not to spoil it. I also rated this only 3 stars becuase of another thing that irritated me, regarding Wren's secret. Also, I can't help but notice the rampant mistakes I always find in Red Dress Ink books. They need to do a better job of editing, as these mistakes and typos can be really distracting. Overall, though Hand Me Down was a worthwhile summer read."
5,Hilarious,This book was absolutely hilarious. I loved the quirky comments and remarks given by Anne and how down to earth and great Ian was. They are perfect for each other! This book is a definite must read for anyone who likes to laugh out loud.
3,Cute story,"This was a fairly standard chick lit book. While I knew fairly early on how it would likely end, there were some twists and turns in the sub-plots that kept things interesting. Anne's aversion to used items was a bit over the top at times."
5,must read summer hit,"This is one of the best books I've read in along time.Lee always writes about characters that I can relate to.In this second book, Anne Olsen (the main character) goes through her ups and downs while living in the shadows of her two sisters. What she does makes me laugh and leaves me wanting nothing but the best for her. Like her first book, this one takes place in Santa Barbara, my home town, so naturally it makes me love it even more. It makes it easier to picture things when I know the scenery.I'm a big fan of Lee Nichols =) !Anyways, if you haven't read her first book 'Tales of a Drama Queen' then you must pick it up along with this one.If you have read her first book, then hurry and pick this up already! You will not be let down!"
4,Celtic Knot Heart Sterling Silver Hook Earrings,"Seller: Silver InsanityI bought these as a gift for my step-mother's birthday on December 19th. My dad had died on November 30th, and I wanted to give her something to commemorate his Celtic heritage. She loves them...My only disappointment is that they're a bit smaller than I imagined they would be.The seller delivered this order 2 days early which meant it arrived right on her birthday. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again."
4,Celtic Knot Heart Earrings,"The earrings are beautiful and of good quality. My only negative is they are too small. You have no way of seeing their true size in the picture as there is no frame of reference. I would have liked them to be bigger. If you are fond of smaller earring though, this is worth it."
2,Not happy with these,"The dangle on these earrings was made of thin wires - I didn't think it was very sturdy and it didn't show up well when I put the earrings on. Also, one of the ear wires was bent. I returned these."
5,Pretty Design and Good Quality,"I've had these earrings for about three months now and haven't experienced any problems (no bending, breaking, falling out, getting caught on stuff, etc). They're wonderfully sized in my opinion -the actual pendant being about 1"" long (without hook) so as to be delicately attractive without being too overpowering. You can't really see the fine detail from afar, but they're quite eye catching nonetheless. On a slighter closer inspection, the detail is quite intricate and interesting. You can't see in the picture too well, but within the pattern there are two gremlin-fairy-looking things on either side of the Celtic pattern that I thought meshed nicely and gave it some added interest. I am very happy with these earrings and highly recommend them to any silver fans."
4,Ear Rings,They arrived in a very nice black velvet bag and will be given as a Christmas gift. They look like quality ear rings.
4,"For the Record, It's Mind Funk...2 Words","Mind Funk, who wanted to call their band a different name where you would exchange the ""n"" in Funk with a ""c,"" were another underrated band. One thing about this band was that they had a great sense of style. The artwork on the cover is beautiful & the interior picture of the band on a grand piano is a classic.They were signed in the late '80s/early '90s as record companies tried to find the next Jane's Addiction or RHCP's. The sound on this disc reflects that. Led by Patrick Dubar, highlights included ""Ride & Drive,"" ""Sister Blue"" and ""Sugar Ain't So Sweet."" They had minor success, with a couple of videos appearing on Headbanger's Ball. But the record never broke and their stay with Sony Music would be short-lived."
3,Public communication campaigns,"I really would like to see the third edition of this book. I would have given four stars but the material is not as current as I would like. Still, it offers a good foundation for health communication campaigns. My favorite chapter was the last by Wallack: a critique of the field and the future of health communications. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in health communications but would suggest they also find more recent research and scholarly articles."
3,i don not agree,"Well i studied algebra in a foreing country ten years ago, i bought this book to refresh my memory and i fund it realy helpful and yes you actualy have to know your stuff, it a review not a learning tool a good review y also own phisics and calculus review and they are good too"
3,Never thought I'd see this re-released,"I bought the only copy of this LP I ever saw, after searching for it for years, in a drug store remainder bin for 25 cents. I was never able to find out much about Dawe- he was never listed in any of the collectable record guides.The highlight of this is the seven plus minute Junkie John. A great, understated Fender bass line introduces a wonderfully low key blues musing that builds up to some furious soloing (too bad Tim didn't hire a better guitarist, though). The rest of the album consists of lightweight but happy pop music.the album title refers to a childrens' book, published in the 1930s by Booth Tarkington, that would be considered extremely politically incorrect today. Get it and read it to your kids anyway, then talk about it. It'll do 'em good."
5,Jacob's Magic Box - Alphabet,Super way to help children learn the alphabet. My 2 year-old loves the objects.
1,Amazon sent me the wrong belt,"I came to this page and entered the information requested about my vehicle. It said this item would fit my vehicle. When it arrived, guess what? It was the wrong belt. Don't try to put this on your 2000 Chevy Tracker 2.0 engine. It is the wrong belt. When I tried to return it Amazon told me it was my fault and I must pay for shipping."
4,Cute aliens at work,"Come and see Dejiko and her friends in these comic snippets from Shonen Champion magazine. See them go through holidays,school exams and each other. See Pyocola try to kidnap Dejiko for ransom. See Pyocola fail again. SD drawings with a lot of liberty. Weird but cute. A gift for mini anime fans."
4,BEAUTIFUL,"If this bible sold for $5 less I don't think anyone previously would have complained.Yes, the paper is thin and the leather could have been heavier to handle the wear & tear of someone who carries it with them often, but it's a very beautiful pink suade bible, with pretty pink/grey endsheets, which makes it quite unique. It is compact in size and I did not find the font to be too small for reading.The silver lining of the pages was not scratched on mine at all."
3,Pink and Grey Suede...,"This Bible didn't really live up to my expectations. I love the translation (NLT), but the quality of the binding leaves something to be desired. The pages are thin, the silver lining of the pages was scratched even though the book was still in the box, and the cover is not especially attractive. Please read the NLT, but don't buy this particular copy unless you are really looking for something bargain basement. In fact, if you're looking for something really cheap, you'd probably find a better quality paperback for less money."
3,ok,"i bought this sword and then found out shortly after that stainless steel really isnt strong steel, so then i tryed to cansle my order but sword demon did not anser my emails and did not anser the phone so i was S.O.L, so then the sword came and i was really mad, but the sword is biuld really well so i have to give them credit for that, but then i started laghing because it is a ninja sword with a samurai on it and it was made in tiwan, but i dont have a choise so i jus keeped it, it is really sharp and i did cut a banana tree in half but im not going to hit a big tree with it because it would probly break in half, this sword is ok but its not my favoret in my colection"
3,There are better interpretations by other ensembles,"John Eliot Gardiner is one of my favorite on Bach and Handel readings but this collection has better interpretations by other english, german and italian ensembles that you can find on Amazon."
3,Works well on the Pro Optic 500mm 6.3,I did not want to spend more on a filter than I spent on the lens I was using it on. So I bought this one. I just wanted something to protect the lens. It was the cheapest I could find and it does what I wanted it to do.
4,Really enjoyed this CD,Varied tracks. I enjoyed all of them. Some of the rhtyms are really infectious... a good buy
4,Scope of book goes far beyond the title,"Let's face it. 80% of what is offered in Christian bookstores is useless drivel or worse. Remember the glut of so-called Christian ""Y2K paranoia"" books? McKenna's book concerns not just how to read a Christian book, but how to select one and how to build a solid Christian library. The appendices, which consist of several booklists, both religious and secular, are worth the price of the book. For Christians who want to get serious about their reading, a very workable three-year reading plan is offered, with books in various genres of Christian writing. Unfortunately, Christian fiction and poetry is given short shrift here. This book is a very quick read and is a valuable addition to any Christian reader's library."
5,Very thoughtful and accurate,"I read a review of this book in Quaker Life, and I picked it up at the bookstore last week. The author is thoughtful, literate, and engaging. I did not buy this for the help on how to be a better reader, but I was pleasantly surprised at the author's presentation of important issues to do with being a careful and discerning reader of all literature to start with, and then of Christian literature in particular. I went out and bought this for the three year reading schedule that is included at the back of the book. It looks excellent, and the appendices and other lists offered by the author are also excellent resources."
2,Not awesome,"I bought this ring for myself and when I got it in the mail I wasn't as thrilled to see it in person. It's a bit lack-luster and scratches very easily, the band looks like it was stretched too thin and after having it for 2 months it's ready to break."
5,LOOKS LIKE THE REAL THING,This ring is so brilliant and radiant. I have had friends tell me that it looks like the real thing from an expensive jewelry store. The band is very sturdy. I'm as impressed as my friends are with the exquisite look and sturdiness of this ring. I would recommend this ring if you're into unique rings.
5,Just Right!,"I purchased this to wear on my pinkie finger and it is perfect for that. It is a very comfortable ring and affords just the right amount of ""bling"" factor."
2,You Get What You Pay For,This is a cute ring for the price. I was looking for a replacement for my wedding ring. This did not work. I promised my 5yr. old daughter this ring when her finger is big enough.
4,Overall extremely honest and beneficial,"Great ring. Exactly what you order, that's what you get! The ring itself to me, looks fantastic. The only problem I have with this ring and most of the other rings advertised on Amazon is that they don't seem to be advertised in half sizes. So, therefore, of course, my girlfriends fingers are all half sizes. Still worth it tho! Amazing looking for what you're paying for it! High recommendation! Thanks!"
3,Pretty Yet Small,"It's very pretty and good quality, but small and dainty. I recommend this ring for women who are looking for a cute look."
2,beautiful ring but scratches,Really nice ring however the silver matte finish is starting to scratch off. i think over time it will be gone entirely.Update:It's been about 2 months since I've had it and it's turned black. Note: I have worn it everyday because it's my cheap wedding ring. (college kids can't afford the real thing...lol) So I guess I would say don't wear it too often or else it will change colors.
4,Good spotting scope.,"I have had many years of use from this spotting scope and can't really complain. It is quite hardy and has survived several scrapes and knocks. It gives an enviable image in comparison to many other scopes I have viewed, and it is fairly lightweight.The only drawback I have had with it was that the mounting on mine seemed permanently loose, despite several attempts to fix - and when coupled with a tripod ball head and related linkages, produced a generally unstable effect. But that is maybe unique to my own setup."
4,a well-written history of the Hapsburg dynasty,"""The Hapsburgs: Embodying Empire"" by Andrew Wheatcroft is a well-written history of the Hapsburgs. It is readable, and does not require a great deal of background knowledge in order to follow the events. The maps at the front are useful in identifying places mentioned in the book, since so many have changed names over the centuries. This book is particularly helpful in telling the history of the beginning of the dynasty--which is not usually told in much detail by other authors. Overall, I found this book interesting and I learned quite a bit from it about the dynasty's interior workings and difficulties."
5,At age 72 a good reason to get back to skiing.,This is the best skiing video i have ever watched. it has encouraged me to get back on skies at 72 years of age and now with some new insites into correct technique.
1,Made My Legs Swell,"These pills made my legs swell up horribly, to the point that my feet did not fit in my shoes. Yes you could not see the veins, but that is because everything was so swollen. I stopped using and wish I could send them back!"
2,Lundmark's Attempts at Humor Don't Translate,"What this book is good for: short, concise historical backgrounds on the letters of the alphabet and punctuation.What this book is bad for: reading. Well-intentioned, but a terminally corny tone makes this book pretty unbearable."
3,Mistitled but enjoyable,"I'm sure many people will find this quirkful and querulous, but the bulk of this book has very little to do with keyboards!The part that does is quite interesting.Starting on page 20, the author switches from a discussion of keyboards to a history of the alphabet and various symbols.Quackish titling if you ask me!"
2,Interesting layout concept on otherwise common knowledge,"I thought ""Quirky Qwerty"" would be an in-depth history of the typewriter. It ended up being a brief history on the characters and symbols on the typewriter.The layout of the book is highly visual, and typesetting plays a big part in the contents, which makes it somewhat catchy However, with the exception of a few points at the beginning of the book, Lundmark added nothing new to what is already known (at least to me; if you find otherwise, modesty forbids). There were also numerous typographical errors throughout the text.In one instance, a sentence was left unfinished.This book is catchy, but it offers little in turn."
1,"Cayenne 40,000HU 180 Capsules, caliente!","After taking these a day or two, my stomach was aching and when I used the toilet, my * * * was BURNING! if you can handle hot peppers, then this product is for you. But for sensitive people like me, stay far away!"
4,Usually......,"I make my own cayenne capsules, but I'm on vacation and ran out so bought this. They work very well.....take with a lot of water. Great as a blood cleanser, heart help, absorbance of other herbs. Natures Way is a brand I trust."
4,Please so far,"I decided to start taking these because I have high cholesterol and am hoping with these, a clean diet and exercise I can get it under control. So far I've noticed a boost in my energy with no side effects. I took them last night with dinner and had a hard time falling asleep, so I will stick to taking them with breakfast and lunch. I did notice I had a lot more energy while at the gym the last 2 nights. I usually tire out after walking 2 miles on the treadmill but was able to go 3 miles with no problem. I even felt like I could go longer. The ones I'm taking also have Garlic and are 530 mg. I bought them at the grocery store. I think I'll check out the local health food store to see what other options there are. I read these are also good for joint pain which I also have."
2,Not What Expected,I think the dosage might have been too strong. I tried to use with food but the supplement was still too strong. I might try a lower dosage.
4,lowers blood pressure,I bought this because it's supposed to help lower blood pressure. In this respect it works pretty well. I've used it 4 times so far (taking 1 capsule with a glass of water) and within an hour it consistently lowered my blood pressure from about 135/92 to about 124/84. Perhaps 2 capsules would work better but I haven't tried that.The only side effect is that it gives you a slight burning sensation that lasts for about an hour. It seems to work best on an empty stomach. I've read that it helps normalize blood pressure by promoting good circulation.This can be used as a supplement but not as a substitute for seriously high blood pressure. Since I only use it occasionally it will last a long time because you get 100 capsules.
3,Ok for frittering away an afternoon under the apple tree,"The Molly Pitcher Society ""is a group of patriotic ladies who get together Sunday nights to find ways to boost the war effort."" The members of the Society are introduced in the Prologue of this book via a November 11, 1942 column in their local newspaper. It was bothersome having to flip back and forth between these short biographical blurbs and the preliminary chapters in which each member receives a ""poison pen"" letter on Monday. Then they start dying.The author does a good job of conveying the Mood of the times, but not so good on characterizations. The group reminded me of a little of the ladies of Amanda Pepper's book club in ""Helen Hath No Fury"" which is a more riveting book. {Yep - this reviewer just made a pun on Rosie the Riviter ;-)"
5,Grill Chef,"My husband loves, loves, just loves this grill. He is the cook of the neighborhood. We grill out just about every evening and he loves cooking on it. He would not have any other grill but this one! If you love to cook outdoors and want a great grill that makes everything taste wonderful buy this one!"
4,Tiling - One Step at a Time,"My first time tiling and this book definately takes you through step by step. Talks about tiling floors as well as walls and countertops. Mostly illustrations but done well enough to understand what each procedure entails. Packed with tips and experts' insights. I high recommend this book and ""Setting Tile (Fine Homebuilding)"" by Michael Byrne."
4,Excellent Book,"Grerat book with lots of step-by-step procedures. Easy to understand, but very laborous steps!"
3,An OK old-fashioned musical.,"Despite the brightly-displayed disclaimer at the beginning (""Any resemblance to real persons is coincidental"", etc.), this corny old musical is obviously about Fanny Brice and Nicky Arnstein. (Almost 30 years later, FUNNY GIRL was made, using the real names.) Nothing remarkable about the plot and cliche situations, but worthwhile for some good musical numbers, the presence of Alice Faye, and Al Jolson's enthusiastic performance as ""Ted Cotter"", a character who is basically Jolson himself. Altho the character does play an important role in the story, Jolson was undoubtedly cast in the part to give him a chance to sing a few of his old hits, which he does extremely well."
3,A lot of fun songs,This is an old-fashioned musical. They took a story about a woman who moves up in show biz with the help of a con man that loves her. They marry and he gets in trouble with the law. A good storyline but a difficult one to stretch into a full movie. Al Jolson is added to liven up the film. DOES HE EVER! I like this movie. I can see it often now.
3,Stand By Your Man Theme,"This movie starts off with lots of fun-filled music and dance. And some Prohibition era speak easy scenes. It features a very young and still handsome as ever Tyrone Powers as a good-hearted con man. With Alice Faye being the naive girl who falls for him even though Al Jolson's character warns her about him. It would be an all around great movie except that they go over board with the Stand By Your man theme. Al Jolson's trademark song about Mammy is featured in the movie several times. And Alice Faye proves to be a good singer. All in all, the movie starts off fun and easy going but has a rather depressing ending. As even though it ends well, they just go too overboard with Alice Faye being the desperately in love with her man against all reason type."
5,Holds everything,This certainly holds it all. I love all the secret compartments. Kind of like a purse but on a much grander scale. I only wish that the side zippers for the computer compartment opened up all the way instead of stopping half-way around. Beautifully crafted.
4,A must read for all who read I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This,"In Lena, Jacqueline Woodson continues the story of Lena and Dion Bright, the two sisters who leave Chauncey, Ohio, to escape the clutches of their abusive father in I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This. Woodson allows the reader to travel with Lena and Dion through Ohio and Kentucky in an effort to find a place called home. Lena and Dion hitch hiking leads to them meeting several people, the final person being an African-American woman ""Miz Lily,"" who is perceptive enough to realize that the girls are homeless. This is a must read for all who read Woodson's I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This."
4,Worth the money. Definitely recommended.,"We purchased this cane for my wife and she's been using it for about two years now. This cane is light weight, strong, comfortable, and adjustable. It is quickly and easily adjustable for those who don't have manual dexterity problems. When my wife could still walk steadily enough to wear heals she frequently changed the cane's length to adjust for whatever shoes she was wearing. I think the button, spring loaded from inside the stem of the cane, is now a bit of a challenge for her, but these days she rarely adjusts the height as she now must wear flat shoes for greatest stability."
2,High quality cane but doesn't fit my needs or likes,"All the canes that I presently use have the vertical shaft directly underneath the handle so I can use my thumb and forefinger to guide it. I feel like I don't have full control of this cane. Also, the rubber-like, spongy material on the handle doesn't work for me. If you have to stop and shake some sweaty hands then the handle becomes a very unsanitary breeding ground for germs.The cane is very well constructed and should last a long time. In a recent visit to the VA hospital, I noticed that the canes the VA issues are identical or nearly identical to this cane so it must have proven to be a reliable unit.I gave mine away."
5,Cane Content,This is a very high quality product. It is exactly as specified. If I have a complaint it was with the poor packaging(huge box with air pillows--did not hold up under UPS handling). Box was smashed and torn--luckily the cane was emeshed in the air pillows.
3,"The cane is OK, but","The cane is very light weight, I dont know if that will be a problem down the road, we will see. My biggest grip about this crane is all the stickers, 4 of them, a barcode, a warning, website info and one thats blank, cant figure that one out but they are IMPOSSIBLE to get off. I dont think there is a person out there that have not run into a sticker that would just not come off and after 10 mins of scrapping it with your fingernail you have a sticky residue left. They could have put more thought in this, because as nice as it feel, its UGLY! The pic in the ad does not show the stickers, and for good reason, and all these stickers are in a 3 inch area."
4,Easy to Clean,"If you have cats that don't sit still long and don't like noise (motorized brushes), this is the combo for you. I have a long haired light colored cat and a short haired dark colored cat. Fur everywhere. You can lengthen the time between baths with this combo.It is sturdy,no need to keep replacing, good for you and the enviroment. The fur is easy to get out of the the brush and you can reuse immediately."
3,Dogs like the gentle touch,"This product does not measure up to ourFURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edgefor either our cattle dog mix or jack russell. The mit doesn't even work on the cattle dog (the brush does some). The Everholders both make a huge mess and hair just goes everywhere off the jack russell. I would never use the Everholder products inside the house, as I would the FURminator. But I find the mit is more relaxing for the dogs. The dogs like the gentler petting of the mit and softer feel of the brush. I still FURminate the heck out of the dogs to remove the most shedding hair possible (especially the cattle dog mix's under coat), but start out and finish up with the Everholder's glove and brush to make the experience better for the dogs. And these brushes do a nice job of removing any lose stray hairs before we go inside."
3,Great for cat massage,I received the brush & hand mitt. We have two large cats. The brush and the mitt did not remove much loose cat hair from the cats - seems like cat hair is too dense for that. (The FURminator Deshedding tool is best for cats). But they did catch some loose hair balls left behind after using the FURminator DeShedding tool plus they gave my cats a nice massage - they purred.
2,Didn't work very well,"I have two cats who shed everywhere. One has fairly coarse hair (almost dog-like) and one has extremely fine, soft hair. Neither the brush nor the mitt really picked up hairs for either one, they just sort of dragged them around. As for actually brushing the cats, it was a definite no-go, the rubber dragged against their coats and both cats (who usually love being brushed) hated it.The only thing I found nice about the product was that the bristles of the brush are flexible but fairly strong. I used it to get down into the crevices of my armchairs where hair collects and drag it up to the surface to be vacuumed away. I will probably keep it around just to do this, but as for brushing the cats or de-furring the furniture, I will definitely stick with lint rollers and vacuuming."
3,"Reusable and Does a Good Job of Picking Up Fur, but........","I specifically went on a search for a fur removing cleaning device that was NOT disposable. I'm tried of going through lint rollers like water cleaning up after my dog and three cats. I decided to try this set specifically for the brush. I use it on my furniture and it works, BUT I've found that it creates ""fur bunnies"" that start flying around and try to escape. It's near impossible to use the brush to pick up the fur without continuing to stir up the mess. I'd say it's better than a lint roller, but it's not the perfect solution.For those that can't read the product description or instructions -- this product is for cleaning FURNITURE, RUGS, etc and not designed as a grooming tool for use on your pets. Duh."
2,I bought this at walmart...I wasted $6,I believe when I bought it the little numbs started picking up some fabric dye off a cheap red shirt...and then I was trying to dust off a white shirt with the same mitt and the red came one the white.I had to rebleach my white and I couldn't believe what a horrible waste the mitt was. The plastic part eventually peeled off from the fabric part of the mitt which made it flimsy.
2,not for my cat,"dad got this, cat doesn't like it... can't brush him for like 3mins even if he is purring he runs off"
1,Bad for cats,"This product will definitely not remove hair from your cat. I have two medium haired beauties, and I had to go to Petsmart to buy a cheaper wire brush and comb to get any of their loose hair off. My daughter's boyfriend looked at them and said that he didn't think it would be helpful for his dogs, either."
4,Good effective product,"Not only does this work well to remove the loose fur from my cat that has medium length fur, it also works well to remove fur from things like clothes, bed linens, and furniture. Ozzy realy enjoys it when I brush him with this too."
4,A new sleuth in town?,"I recently purchased The Curse of Midnight Manor and I really didn't know what to expect. At first I thought it would be like Nancy Drew but about twenty minutes into the game I realized it wasn't so much a caper I was here to solve, but the existence of real ghosts! There's two full stories in the game, the second being my favorite that involves the ""accidental"" death of a magician.Delaware is a very likeable character who is also psychic so he picks up clues normal people couldn't. The atmosphere is creepy with some wonderful music throughout the game. I give this game a 4 for only the reason I wish it was longer! I didn't want it to end luckily the sequel is already out and I have that on order too!"
3,A decent start,"Being a long-time fan of adventure games, I love to see more popping up at every twist and turn. I especially love games made by small or independant groups who are moe interested in producing a good story than a high-selling shoot-em-up game.The fist volume introduces the characters and provides a decent adventure that I completed in an evening. Its a good game for people new to the genre as the puzzles are fairly simple. Unfortunately the game also includes a couple of slow-paced chase sequences that are annoying at best, but can be difficult for someone who is not used to the ""myst"" style of manuvering through the world.The graphics are pretty good and the music is very good, considering the type of production company that produced it.All in all, its a decent game for the price. Hopefully the next games in the sequence will have some of kinks worked out."
1,SOOOO Lame,"This is by far, the worst adventure game I ever tried, Lame graphics, no good story, strange puzzles (So silly sometimes, SO impossible to guess on other times, like the maze puzzle in the middle of it), it took only 1 hour and half to finish it,(after resorting to a walkthrough to solve the maze), the LONG dialogs CANNOT be skipped, you are forced also to watch the complete list of credits, when you start, and when you finish the game, with no way to stop it.if the rating has a minus , i will rate it a minus 4 stars."
2,art nouveau in cross stitch,"This is a small, cheap book with a few of art nouveau style cross stitch projects. If you collect this staff by it, but if you are an ambitius sticher do not expect to much. Most of projects are small (peacock trinket box). Three a bit large (Tiffany style window, Mucha style head, Peacock) max 80 * 80 stitches."
2,Nothing for an ambitious stitcher,"This is a small... book with cca 10 art nouveau style cross stitch projects. Three of them are midle-size - maximum 80 * 80 stitches (Tiffany style window, Mucha style head and Peacock). Some are whole stitches only, others use partial stitches. If you like half day projects and the still buy it. If you collect this kind of book by it...."
1,DIDNT WORK!,This battery worked fine for a few pictures --when put in the recharger- they went DEAD...tried three all with same result the manufacturer was great and issued a full refund??
2,Markers Too Light,"These markers are way too light. They show up on dry erase boards bright fluorescent yellow like hi-lighters instead of anything that you can use efficiently for any projects. If you need to create a presentation where the people viewing the information are more than 3 or 4 ft away or at an angle, they cannot see anything. I do not suggest you purchase these markers unless you plan to use them strictly for coloring."
3,Overview of a few,"This book highlights a few of the more popular psalms, and in a rather general way. As such, it's appropriate for a personal devotional shelf, but not very satisfying for a more serious Bible studier."
4,Psalms (Interpretation Bible Studies),I was impressed by this book and need my own copy. The information included is what is needed to teach a Bible Study on the Book of Psalms.
1,Skip this book if you've got Graffiti 2,Wait until the 3rd edition comes out as this book is too old.His website is junky too.
1,You are a dummie if you need this book.,"I have owned several Palm PDA's over the years. Mostly, this book explains the obvious and I find no information that is not covered by the instruction manuals - or available on line for free. Also, all Palm functions described in this book are not present on all Palm PDA's, and information on all Palm PDA's are not covered.If you just got to read this book, rather than buy it, check it out at your local library and don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing,"I guess that I should know better. Most of the ""for Dummies"" have too much useless information and are not organized in manner that is conducive to find the answer to a problem."
2,wouldn't recommend,"I wouldn't recommend this book. I'm trying to learn to build some stone walls at my house, and this book isn't bad, it's just not that good. The author doesn't speak of himself as an expert, and I think that shows in the writing quality and knowledge."
3,Somewhat helpful,"The book is very helpful with the theory of wall building. It lacks somewhat in specifics, and is also a bit dated. I was surprised it did not mention or deal with flagstone.One positive benefit is in gaining some insight into the importance of placing stones so they interconnect and solidify, so as to create a unit. I was hoping for something that dealt more with mortared walls."
5,worth it just for the philosophy,"This delightful, practical book is worth buying just for the first page of the introduction which is as simple, wise, and true as anything I have ever read -- about walls or about life. The book contains good, solid advice about technique and safety, and provides support for the right way of thinking and planning when you are about to build something that might stand for centuries."
2,"Very brief, minimal detail.","This book concentrates on dry stone walls, even though the title does specifically say this. Although the book does mention mortar stone walls, minimal detail and description is provided. One could not possibly build a mortar stone wall from reading this book."
3,McRaven did it better!!,"Charles McRaven's ""Building Stone Walls"" is much better. Covers all the material and techniques that Vivians book does and more! Don't waste your time on this book. If you're looking for more detail on working with stone, McCraven's book is the one."
4,Oldie but goody,very interesting and heart provoking documentary. Which they would up date. I think many more people would listen and watch more if it was updated.
3,I Can't Complain,"Patti Labelle's Be Yourself is a perfect example of two many hands in the pot. Although a good effort by Labelle, it has a lot to be desired. By far the ballads are the best (as is usually the case with most of her work), followed by the two Prince penned tunes Yo Mister and Love 89. Even the Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produced Be Yourself is just medicore. Not nearly Labelle's best work, but far from being her worst."
5,ZOMBIES IN SPURS,"From the opening scene in the old stagecoach to the apocalyptic ending in a church, DEAD IN THE WEST delivers more thrills and spills it in its short length than many 300+ tomes. Joe Lansdale, known for his black humor, whips it out in plenty in this tale of a Reverend who wanders into Mud Creek and finds himself involved in the curse of an Indian wrongly accused of killing a young girl, and lynched. His mulatto woman was also brutally raped and murdered. The curse is purely simple: zombies beget more zombies, and Lansdale spares nothing in his brutally graphic and frightening tale. Joining Rev. Jeb in the spotlight is a delightful young boy named David; the bewitching Abby and her rascally doctor father; and of course the many zombies populating the scene.The book is relentless and no character is guaranteed safety by the time the book ends; it has a rather ""twisty"" ending as well; did he ever do a sequel? It would be great!!!A very good horror story."
4,Can't Beat It With a Stick,"Zombies in the Old West. An Indian curse and a town with a dark secret. A beautiful woman and a stranger with a troubled past, who may be the town's only hope. Plenty of graphic, gross-out horror told with wit and respect for the B-movies and horror comics that are clearly the inspiration for this story. (Think a young Clint Eastwood in the movie version, directed by George Romero.) This is not Lansdale at his absolute best, but he's not striving for great literature here. I bet he had as much fun writing it as I had reading it."
3,"An entertaining, but expensive read","Joe Landsdale's pulp fiction/B movie homage ""Dead in the West"" is an entirely servicable and entertaining story, filled with black magic, buxom babes, guns, demons, zombies, and an alcoholic holy man with a penchant for violence. When it comes to the pulps, these are all very good things indeed!I bought the book and finished on a lazy Sunday, reclined in my favorite chair. I enjoyed the story for what it was worth, but, well, felt strangely cheated out of my $19! For that price tag, 148 pages is a SLIM read, especially with margins as wide as those in this book.Long story short: you will most likely burn this through book in a few hours. And when you do, if you think it will merit multiple readings (I didn't) then you'll probably get your money's worth out of this. But for $19, I think you should try to borrow this book from a friend or library, and spend your money on something more rewarding instead."
4,Zombie in the Old West,"Lansdale seemlessly blends motifs of the horror and western genre in this very short, fast-paced book.However, I felt that Lansdale is trying to shock a little too hard in some of his passages (wait till you find out what kind of emotional baggage the preacher is carrying around), but also makes it seem a rather casual aspect of the plot.The ""zombies"" have an interesting fusion of mythology attached to them and certain parts of the story seem to prefigure ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".A great book and an excellent example of how the horror western can succeed when written like this."
4,Night of the Living Dead meets Italian Spaghetti Westerns,"This is an excellent early novel by a cult favorite author of the South. It combines, Lovecraftian supernatural terror with ""Night of the Living Dead"" motifs in a hard-edged Western setting that reminds one of the Sergio Leone ""Spaghetti"" Westerns of the late 1960s. There is an excellent two issue comic adaptation that was published by Dark Horse Comics in 1991 that is also worth a hunt through back issue bins in a good comics store. Lansdale currently writes Southern flavored mysteries, and ""Dead in the West"" is a great sample of his early period. It's a book that will keep one awake at night terrorized that an unknown, undead gunslinger may be knocking at your door."
3,Thumbs up.,"First chapter starts off a slow, contemplated putting the book down half way through it. Second chapter picks up considerably. The book continues this momentium throughout. Overall a fun read."
3,occupational health,"Discusses the general principles and definitions in occupational epidemiology, describe the work-related hazards and diseases, information collection and the use of data in the assessment of health risk and in descriptive epidemiology. General methods of epidemiological studies are discussed some aspects such as the study of combined effects, the statistical analysis of epidemiological data, the validity aspects of epidemiological studies are addressed among others."
1,Doesnt work,"The product description says it works ""with any wired or wireless IP camera"", however I have not been able to get it to work with the wireless security cameras I bought for my home so that I could monitor them from work via the internet. I cannot even get past the initial setup as the software doesn't recognize the cameras. This product may work well with a webcam or something similar but does not do what I need it for."
5,One Of Petty's Best!,"Another great Tom Petty album! Ranks right up there with TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS, DAMN THE TORPEDOS and YOU""RE GONNA GET IT. Jeff Lynne's production is perfect and the songs all can stand next to Petty's best."
4,Fun,"Petty realizes that rock is all about attitude. Any fool could write these three-chord songs in ten minutes, but it takes quite a gutsy performer to pull them off. Yes, they're catchy, and the lullabye ""Alright for now"" is surprisingly touching. Jim Keltner seldom plays a drum fill, he just whacks out a heavy backbeat, a style which is fine for this album (though it's grown tiresome since). This is certainly one of Petty's best as an overall album."
5,An album of its time,"Music is indelibly linked to the era in which it is first unleashed on the public. If you compiled a soundtrack of the late 80s, Full Moon Fever would feature prominantly - even the little ""hello CD listeners"" blurb can't help but remind us of the days when music shops actually were stocked to the brim with cassettes, and the little silver discs were only just being embraced by the public. Top to bottom this is one of the most radio friendly albums I've ever heard. I suppose some might see that as a failing, but if you like solid musicianship, melodic hooks, and lyrics that may be moving one moment and goofy the next, then grab this brilliant gem."
5,Petty's Comeback - Terrific album overall,"I am such a big Petty fan that it was hard to give some of his prior albums less than five stars. But okay, I admit it, he had lost some of his brilliance. Full Moon Fever represents a thorough and effective restoration of Petty's rule over American rock music.Perhaps this sounds like something of an oxymoron, but let me give this a try to sum up the album: In FMF, Tom Petty ties together a lot of the themes of his earlier albums and states implicitly a lot of the themes of ambivolence and confusion of modern life that he'd alluded to in the 70s and 80s. (My sister got lucky, married a yuppie, took him for all he was worth/Now she's a swinger, dating a singer/I can't decide which is worse.) But, as a subsequent line reads, ""But not me, baby/I've got you to save me"". Tom Petty, you save me every day and you conveniently also saved your career with this one."
5,now we know,"Despite having numerous hits before releasing this album, it took until we heard the ultra famous ""Free Fallin"" and ""I Won't Back Down"" to REALLY establish Tom Petty as one of radios favorite musicians at the time. With this album, now everyone knew very well who Tom Petty was. Before this, while he was still popular (especially with that late 70's album he did) I remember how his popularity sky rocketed after Full Moon Fever was released. I recommend the album too. With so many great quality tracks, you HAVE to buy it."
5,1st solo by Tom Petty.,"Tom Petty's ""Full Moon Fever"" (1989) #3, is still one heck of a record 22 years on. Tom got Jeff Lynne (ELO/Move) to produce this great album. For an album to have all these hits and album cuts, it never seems to get old. ""Free Fallin' "" #7 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, is still one great tune.As are these songs, ""I Won't Back Down"" #29 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, """"A Face In The Crowd"" #46 hot 100 and #5 mainstream rock, ""Love Is A Long Road"" #7 mainstream rock, ""Runnin' Down A Dream"" #23 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, The Byrds cover ""Feel A Whole Lot Better"" #18 mainstream rock, ""Yer So Bad"" #5 mainstream rock, ""The Apartment Song"", """"Alright For Now"", the jangly ""A Mind With A Heart Of It's Own"" (Should of been another hit), and the playful ""Zombie Zoo"". Great stuff by Petty and Lynne."
4,Tom Petty Won't Back Down.,"Tom Petty may not be too well known in the UK, but on this showing many people are missing some great music.First off, Free Fallin', it's a sure fire winner and then I Won't Back Down, it's a double knockout.Tom has a zest for life which he puts into all his music and, of course, he can play a bit too.When it comes to appreciating The Byrds few people are more upfront than Tom and Feel A Whole Lot Better is simply a wonderful Byrds tribute.The rest is not bad either and I also recommend Roger McGuinn's 1991 Back From Rio where Tom provides able assistance, basically making it Roger's best solo recording!"
2,Good Muzak,"Nice enough as car muzak, unremarkabale otherwise.Among other things, nobody bothered to point out to Mr. Petty that it was I Won't Back Down, not we Won't Back Down. Perhaps a calculated insult to the Man in Black?"
2,this one is a dud,"I really enjoyed the first two discs in this series, but this one was a real disappointment. Instead of offering a lot of clever song combinations, this one is more like quick 30 second samples of various songs with a constant beat in the background. What's unbearable is that you'll hear ""RADIO SOULWAX!"", ""RADIO DJ!"", etc interjected over and over again throughout the tracks, which completely ruins the mood in my opinion. This happened to a lesser extent in the first two discs, but this time it was out of control."
2,A disappointing Book on a Great Equine artist,"I ordered this book sight unseen when it first came out. I was hoping for what is expected in a book about artists -- lots and lots of examples of the artist's work. So I was a very disappointed. It's a nice biography if you like to read, but if you like to turn the pages to be awed by equine art, don't buy this book. This author did not do justice to this famous equine artist."
3,"Great artist, disappointing book","If you're a collector of Paul Brown art, this book is a must have. But it's very disappointing and vague in details. Books are cataloged by author and include publisher, date, #pp, dust jacket info, and a 1-liner of story. But the most needed feature is the art and the description is limited to 'black and white illustrations.' No mention pencil, pen, dry brush, or if there's drawings on every page or just a few. There's also very few examples of the art when the author could have attained permission to show an example from each book. The book does show aquatints and Brooks Bros. clothing ads, of secondary interest.There is nice bio info. It is incredulous to learn the Paul Brown never rode a horse, yet no one can capture horse and rider like he can! (As long as the rider is a male!!)."
3,The 55th C.A.C. of WWI,"I've really enjoyed this book, in part because it talked about the history of the unit that my maternal grandfather served in during WWI. It's especially interesting that the author put anecdotals within the accounts of the actions the unit took part in."
3,Creepy Looking But .....,This piece and the accompanying female bust are effectively creepy looking for a haunted house but beware of the following two cons: 1. The back piece is completely flat (which may make ideal for hanging on the wall) and 2. They weigh almost nothing (not the 10 lbs as advertized)so not sure why it cost so much to ship. Disclaimer: I purchased mine from another seller.
1,I don't get it,"This song, featuring yet another pairing of Ja Rule and Ashanti, made it all the way to #2 on the pop charts, yet I don't remember it being played anywhere, ever. Maybe it's because Ja Rule still has some diehard fans - but I don't know about that either, judging from the amount of people that own The Last Temptation. Oh well."
1,Another Scary Singing Song from Ja&Ashanti,Another Singing Song from JA&Ashanti&another cut to avoid.typical Production&vocals that put you to sleep from start to finish.
3,uneven beam pattern,"These lamps were a good price, but they do put out a rather uneven beam pattern. Not entirely satisfied with them. If you're illuminating artwork, especially, you'll need a better lamp."
2,"Cute, but doesn't swim","We purchased both the alligator and the lobster 'swimming' tub toys. Both just flap around a bit, but don't really move. Cute, but you get what you pay for!"
5,Hilarious and moving,"No one on this Earth is funnier than Kevin Kling. Kling's anecdotes, covering his childhood and adult years, are rich with sidesplitting humor and are also at times very emotionally moving."
3,"Not a very cozy ""cozy.""","I read the first book in this series, ""Roots of Murder"" and enjoyed it. I missed the next two, then happened on this one. I expected to enjoy it as much as the first but was very disappointed by the amount of violence in it. Also, the author increased the level of suspense higher than I prefer. Our heroine was run off the road, seriously injuring her romantic interest (who did that? We're never told). Her car was vandalized, a woman was gruesomely stranged, another was blown up, there was arson -- far too much mayhem for a traditional cozy and as that's the type of book I prefer, this was not for me."
1,not good,"I was not impressed by this cd. I enjoyed Forever, For Always, For Luther 1 & 2. If you want to hear good tributes than purchase those instead. I cound't stand to listen to another song on this CD!!!"
4,only problem,"with this book is that it's too short. I have found it useful as a solid tool to interact with the historicity of the Bible. Oh, one more problem...there needs to be an updated edition. It's great, even for practical pastoral work!"
1,Unwatchable,"Package arrived quickly and in good shape, however the video itself is unwatchable. I played the entire tape and constantly adjusting tracking to no avail. Picture rolled the entire time and was unwatchable. Disappointed."
3,Slow and sloppy - stick to the NYPhil recordings,"I picked up a copy of this recording, interested to hear the ""odd man out"" among Bernstein's Mahler 2 recordings.It is among the slowest Mahler 2's I've ever heard, particularly in the first movement. Thanks to Bernstein, that doesn't translate into tedium, but occasionally the music threatens to come to a complete standstill. The orchestra, alas, has some technical issues, and there are some brass flubs that are quite exposed and obvious. That wouldn't bother me in performance, but on a recording, it is annoying on repeated listening.Janet Baker is marvelous, as she is in the appended Kindertotenlieder, but she can be heard in better surroundings than this set. Stick to one of Bernstein's New York Mahler 2's."
2,Doesn't work well.,"Couple issues with this item:1) When it gets hot, it doesn't lay flat any more, curling up around the points and leaving gaps for the eggs or pancake batter to leak out.2) Sides are not high enough. Despite putting as little batter into the mold as possible, it always rose over the sides of the mold, creating a mess.Overall, if you're really careful, you can make it work."
1,Not very good at all,"Either we should expect to see a descriptive book about Ocean Liners (which this book is certainly not!) or we should expect to find a pictorial overview of the subject. This books misses both targets.Some other titles by this author include subjects as diverse as; France, Tigers, Robert Mitchum and Sharks. Now we have his offering on the subject of Ocean Liners. Having also studied and reviewed Mr Server's book on Sharks (in which I said ""I don't think he's ever seen a live shark in his life!""), this author gives the clear impression he is out to write as many books as possible - with the minimum of information. In so doing, he attempts to fool the reader by including some (but only some!) excellent photographs.The key to any book about ships is research, research and even more research. Not a concept this author appears to understand.NM"
2,"Poorly researched, poorly written, well illustrated","A low quality work with numerous gross inaccuracies and insufficient narrative. Most of its information seems to come from the works of William Miller. The color illustrations (period posters, advertising materials and sketches) and black & white photos are the highlight of the book, even though most labels do not tell which ship is pictured."
1,A colorful but error-filled book,"A definite buy for a few dollars for the pictures alone, but I have never read a book before or since (I bought the item in 1990) that contained so many factual errors. Several captions for the phtographs were obviously written for melodramatic effect rather than any attempt at veracity."
2,I think I got a lemon,"The company responsible was fast and attentive in responding to my order. However, the keyring fell apart two weeks after I purchased it."
1,Broke after one week,the title says it all. The ball that locks the keychain together popped out and now i have half a keychain.
2,Not secure enough,"The product does not have a locking mechanism that you have to manually operate to release the links, you simply pull them apart. I have found that the individual parts come apart fairly easily so I am concerned that I will lose a portion of my keys. If you do not use the keyring in and out of a purse etc. then it would probably be OK."
2,Broke after 4 weeks,"Terrific key chain, with one problem. It only lasted 4 weeks. Bad design, not built to last."
1,came apart within one minute of use!,"""pull apart"" is the perfect name for this key ring! It has no integrity, and will come apart in your pocket."
3,Nature's Answer?,"I bought this figuring I had to use a drop or two a day. When I received the product it said to use a dropper full or two, twice a day! So it isn't going to last very long. I was going to use to to boost my immune system this winter. I will have to buy a lot of it for that purpose."
2,Didn't notice any effect,This is supposed to stimulate your immune system and make you feel more energetic. I didn't notice any effect after taking daily for a month.
4,Saved me in Egypt!,"Went on a trip up & down the Nile in Feb. Every time I felt a twinge of Anything, topped up with a dropperful, and felt great! I also took Oregano Oil and put it in my water bottles as a preventive for stomach bugs. Better than taking the ""Red Pills"" the company doled out for that. They work very well according to all who imbibed, but I'd much rather be on the side of immunity;-)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ABCYGM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,A Friend,"Bought for a friend to help her with mid-life symptoms. She said it was easy to take, yet could not yet tell if it made any difference."
5,Has a great deal of value to offer avid cyclists,"Bicycle Touring Made Easy by recreational bicycling enthusiast Lise Krieger (her first major bike trip was a 1200-mile trek from Victoria, British Columbia to San Francisco, California) is a simple, highly practical guide for cross-country cyclists of all experience levels. Black-and-white photographs illustrate step-by-step instructions on countless useful skills such as how to change a bicycle chain, how to train one's endurance without overtaxing oneself, techniques for safe bike riding in traffic and much more. Especially recommended for beginners, Bicycling Touring Made Easy has a great deal of value to offer avid and experienced cyclists everywhere."
3,"If You Liked ""The Bends"" and ""OK Computer"". . .",". . . more than the experimental avant-garde style of the more recent Radiohead discs, then this is the band for you. From the Rhodes piano to the vocals that slip between plaintive and falsetto to the earnest minor-key guitar-driven songwriting, this is a good band that's very reminiscent of Radiohead's former sound.This, their second disc, offers no surprise punches, staying very consistent with the sound established on their self-titled debut. By the way, I think that if you only pick one by the band, you should go for that first one.I'm very pleased that paloalto does what they do. Now that Radiohead has decided that they don't want to be Radiohead anymore, someone had to fill the gap and paloalto is doing very well. Hey - if you've got to bite off someone else's sound, at least make it a good band."
4,Why didnt this album make it big?,"Im kinda behind on writing this, but Ive enjoyed this record so much. The guys voice is so pleasing to the ears, although kinf of grinding on some songs. Sleeping citizens is one of the best songs Ive heard in awhile. Simple but you can feel it so well. This is just a good rock album."
5,Love This Band,"I love Palo Alto and their songs. They are way better then Coldplay. They maybe lesser known then Coldplay but they are definitely better. I first heard Palo Alto on the Daredevil Soundtrack with the song Fade Out/In. It made me by this CD and as I listened to their songs I fell in love with their songs and their ability to create great music. Not boring music that makes you want to fall asleep like Coldplay in which all their songs sound the same, Palo Alto is able to make the difference between songs that makes them great musicians unlike Coldplay who plays the same things over and over."
4,The best.,If you love The Fine Young Cannibals you would love this cd. The songs are simple and the melodies catchy. Love it.
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on!,"The poster I ordered arrived well packaged for shipping, but the poster itself appears to be a poor replica of the original poster. Granted, the movie came out several years, so I don't necessarily expect that it should be an original. But the product listing should be clearer. Even then, the print quality is extremely poor. It's like someone printed it out on their desktop printer that was running low on black ink. I would return it, but it's so cheap to begin with, it's not even worth the price of return postage!"
4,Great new band,"I really liked this cd, and I hope to hear a lot more from this band in the future. Even if you don't really dig punk all that much, this cd is worth checking out. The only small problem that I have, and if you can call that a problem, is there songs at times are bit long. But it's not like that really matters or makes a difference on anything. It's still a great cd from a promising new band! Check it out, you won't be let down!"
4,Sharp graduation,"I have bought this one along with Zykkor 58mm Split Gradual Neutral Density ND Pro Filter (at amazon too)and I agree with those who write that it gives sharp graduation. But for those who need exactly this, it's good and the price is ok. For those who want smoother graduation, choose Zykkor mentioned above.As for delivery, package and filter quality, it is perfect, no complaints."
4,Very good,"It works very good for what it was designed. Gradation is right smooth and progressive, as this king of filters should it starts smoothly from the middle towards the side progressively, maximum ND grade on the border is right. Crystal clear images, no blur at all.Of course, as a fixed gradation ND filter should be use on the right way, on the right photo, specially for darken bright sky, if you overlay the shadow area on the wrong way it will darken the wrong areas, there's no mystery about it. If the transition seems to be different from what you need just buy an adjustable filter like this one:Kit for Cokin P Series System (58 MM). Includes: Graduated Gradual Grey Square Filter + Adapter Ring + Filter Holder + 1 Ultra Fine Goja Microfiber Cleaning ClothI like it, it works perfectly for what it is done and for me."
3,Bridge to Freedom,"The book ""Bridge To Freedom"" was a good book because it showed how people can work to servive in a crisis.The book showed that even at the young age of fifteen one can compromise and get along with others they know nothing about. I would recomend this book to anyone reading on the Holocaust."
4,Bridge to Freedom,"The book Bridge to Freedom by Isabel R. Marvin was a good bookbecause it showed a lot of detail. The book is about a young girl and boy ,both fourtenn,who meet in a cave on the side of a cliff.The girl is an escaped jew and the boy is a natzi solider. They set aside there difrences and strugle to stay alive. They are torn apart and meet each other again in the most unlikly situation. I thought the author did a fine job in this book."
4,Good Jewish Music by One of the Best Jewish Bands,"This CD holds a collection of the songs that Safam plays while on tour. This music reveals the beauty of old Jewish tradition with the flavor of American Life giving music and understanding to an ancient culture. While the songs are mainly oriented to Jewish people, the music includes Hebrew (note: the name Safam means mustache) which anyone can listen to and appreciate. Many of the songs are also in English and just about anyone can feel the music once they listen. I recommend this to anyone who is a Jewish American, is studying Jewish culture, or is intrested in traditional ""Jewish American"" soft rock."
4,Good General Info,"The video quality is excellent and provides great info about the sport. I think it is a better DVD choice over ""paddling the recreational kayak"". It gives a little bit more info on the sport that other videos. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into this sport."
3,Funny,"This is a cute story about belly buttons! What they are and a little more. A Little long for toddlers, but the illustrations are enough to grab their attention. If you're looking for a book to explain belly buttons, then get this book!"
2,blows,didnt work when i plugged my phone in to the CABLE! waste of money. could of bought a soda instead what a shame
2,Cord Half Worked,The cord only half worked. We tried jiggling it and it worked for a second. Cord felt very unstable. I was very disappointed and I am returning the item today.
5,so much better than my last one,"Well I bought one last year, a cheaper one, and well it stopped working, so i decided to pay a little more. First of all you can just feel the quality of this wire it feels and looks nice, not a cheap plastic wire like my last one. works flawlessly on my surround sound."
5,Good enough...,"I had some experience with the retractable version of this cable. I bought this for my wife's car so having something that retracted out of sight when not in use was handy. However, the cable stopped working after about a year or so, the constant stress at the attachment point from the retractor must have made the wires fray. This product takes up a bit more room, but there's a bin in the car to stow it, so no big deal. And it works, and should continue to do so.I'm connecting a Garmin 760w to the audio aux input of a Odyssey stereo - works fine!"
3,cords,i gave this product 3 stars because it's ok but not the best to use as a replacement cord for my headphones/ ear muffs
2,You Can do better for the Price,These aren't particularly durable and there are similar (and longer) cables out there for cheaper on the site. I'm a big fan of Cables-to-go but in this case you can do better elsewhere.
4,"Standard cable, well built","I like the cable, it works fine. However, it seems to be a bit limp at the connectors(too flexible). I would have preferred a bit stiffer, but it's working and was a good price. The receiver of this cable, for car stereo, enjoys the green."
5,Great cables,"I hooked my Thinkpad laptop to my Samsung 46"" TV using this cable, and played some songs from YouTube. The sound was great. I have no problems with this cable and am happy to recommend it."
3,Worked well but didn't last,"If you need a cable that will last only 10 months with moderate use, this is your cable. If you are looking for a long-lasting product pass on this one."
4,Works For Now,I go through these particular cables often because I have a special port in my suv especially for a male to male stereo cable so I can play my ipod using the head phone jack. So this cord was a little long for my needs but so far is holding up. The sound quality is unaffected (a good thing). My only problem with these things is I think they are way too overpriced for what they are. Shipping was fast though.
5,Great product with great price,I ordered this to use it with my HDTV and my laptop and it works so great! I'm so glad I got this audio cable.
5,Perfect,"Not too much to say about these. They work just as expected. I use it in my car so I can listen to Spotify from my iPhone. It's a little long for the car, but a zip tie will take care of that. Fantastic deal for the price."
2,Horrible buzzing noise when 3dtv is connected to laptop,"Horrible buzzing noise, so hard to tolerate that I mute the tv when Im not watching a youtube video.Right now as I do this review it's muted, the weird part is when a video is playing(whether youtube or a movie on my laptop)the buzzing noise decreases until it's gone. If it keep buzzing I will just use cables for a different purpose. Be warned, I'd recommend checking for a different brnd of cables."
5,It works like the others !,"It's cheap but, it works like the others and, nice and clear audio too!It works fine with anything!It looks clean and the company used nice matireal"
3,Its an ok cable.,"The order arrived on time. The quality of the cable is not good. When I used the cable, the vocals are very low but the background noise is amplified. Also slight movements in the cable causes static to emit from my sound system. I won't be returning this since I paid only 4$ and my shipping was free due to prime. If the seller or amazon will pay for return shipping I will look into the same."
1,Strange buzzing,Used as part of an extension - but couldn't because it made a strange buzzing sounds. So useless to me.
5,awesome!,ive had this cable for over a year. it is durable and works great with a number of devices that i own.
1,feedback,"this long cable worked for a day and then it started a buzzing sound coming frommy computer from my television,it did not work well."
3,good,"you get exactly what you want that is if you want this, and its what you need, you will be happy with it."
2,okay...,"I mean it sort of works, if you don't mind static, quiet music and having to wiggle the cable every once and awhile to keep it working."
5,Sturdy cable,"It works well and is long enough to reach the middle seat of our van. The kids love it. It has lasted longer than other, more expensive cords."
2,Doesn't do its job,"I use this to listen to music with in my car. It works, however only on the front seat passenger side speaker. I tried adjusting the controls, and when I transfer the sound to the driver's side speaker, you can only faintly hear the music when turned up to the max. It's not my car, because I have another cable that I use that works fine. I only use this when I have to, because hearing music only in my right ear drives me crazy after a while."
4,"It does its job, for cheap.","Great value for a great cord. My main use for it is recording guitar on to my computer, and my only issue is there is some static/white noise. But it isn't very noticeable."
5,Perfect...,I bought this cable to connect my cassette player to my computer so I could make cds out of my old music cassettes. Have had no problems thus far. I couldn't be more pleased.
3,Doesn't fit all jacks,"This is probably my own ignorance, but if you're not familiar with this kind of cable, be aware that it might not fit your tv's sound jack. It fit one of my older tv's audio ports (that tv was probably from around 2008 or so), but not the newer one I purchased in 2010. It works great when it plugs in, but just make sure you know what you're buying!"
4,sounds great,"Thanks- this male to male cable works great, I am able to hear my tunes throught the car sound system!"
5,PERFECT to play my iPod in the car!,"My car offers line-in audio which means I can play my iPod directly through my car speakers without the need of a scratch, static-filled fm tuner. If your car has line-in, forget wasting your money on the tuners and just get a cable like this.The only downfall is that it doesn't charge your iPod like the fm tuners, which probably isn't news to you, but just a reminder."
1,AUX CABLE,"I liked the product when I first received it appeared to be very durable however, it was not and stopped working after two weeks. I used the cable in my car to be able to hear music from my IPOD"
4,Great for the price and purpose,"I bought this in order to connect the headphone jack of my laptop to my audio receiver, and this works very well. I am pleased with the length, and after a few more months of use (it has been one month, no problems yet), I will be pleased enough to consider it a 5-star purchase, but from my experience the cheaper wires tend to deteriorate after some time. That said, highly recommend for the purpose."
5,Very helpful to me...,"When I pointed to this site to recommend this book to a friend, I was stunned to see a review of 1 star. Even though I definitely consider myself a novice as well, especially in regard to digital photography, I had no problem learning from this book and following the examples.This book was very helpful in doing what it set out to do - teach photo retouching and restoration. I was very confident in recommending it. Kudos!"
3,"Okay, but not the best...By far","If you are new to the whole retouching and restoration thing, as I am, then this is a great book. It will give you the basics of everything. As we all know, you have to crawl before you can walk.That being said.This book is quite a bit out dated. It will still give you the basics, like I said, but there are new, better, and easier ways to do things.The bottom line: If you are new at this sort of thing and want to master the basics: go for it!If you already know how to take red eye out of your pictures, this might be a bit too basic for you."
1,OUT OF DATE,"I bought this and, like a fool, didn't check the copyright date (2002). I sat down with my new Photoshop Elements version 8, and read that the author was proudly touting his coverage of the brand new version 2. Utterly useless, way out of date!"
2,Outdated,Examples primarily done in Photoshop Elements 1.0 and 2.0Current PSE is 7.0...kinda disappointing.
1,Not enough help for a novice,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a good guide and on first reading it it seem to be just that--however when I started to try out some of the examples on my computer, they didn't work. Steps were omitted and since I am a novice I need every step outlined which is what I expect from a ""dummies"" book. Very disappointing."
3,Salvatore F,"Just one of the 3 boxes came with the plastic inside in the box that keep the product in place and clean,"
1,Very bad choice for any serious java programmer,"The organization of this book is O.K. However, there are too many typos and seldom of those programs works! It is a really bad choice for beginners because there are too much details. It is also bad for advanced programmers because there are too few examples to succeed compiling!"
4,"Food, Shelter, Clothing: this one focuses on Food",In a disaster we're likely to have the clothes on our backs and be able to improvise shelter from the remains of our buildings or have a handy tent if we're prepared. Any fool can manage these basics.FOOD is NOT something most of us have on hand in large quantities in a form we can store without refridgeration. WATER is not so simple in many areas where streams and ponds aren't readily available. The focus of this book is on storing and preserving food/water for short and long term emergencies. It's too late to figure it out after a disaster. Sigarelli offers extensive imformation on how to prepare in a manner easily incorporated into our every day lives- now. Small adjustments over time allow for easy stockpiling. You decide if you want to prepare for short or long term disaster.Highly recommended.
4,"Very thorough, not well proofread","This book is very thorough, and although it seems a bit alarmist, it's apparent that the information he covers could really become necessary in terms of a major disaster. My primary criticism is the in the editing. The author continually uses the word ""loose"" when he means ""lose,"" for example, and it's an error that's found throughout the book. It makes me cringe when I see it, but when you get past things like that the information is valuable and it's well presented.Whether you're an all-out build-a-bomb-shelter in your backyard type, or just someone who wants to be prepared for a weeklong power outage in the winter, this book has you covered."
2,Too vague to be very useful,"This book brings up too few scenarios to be useful that way, and really didn't do much more than thoroughly go into the pros and cons of purchased food preservation methods."
3,The best?,"I picked up this book after having read it some time ago. Reason is I chanced to read these reviews, and I'm stunned. Best book on the subject, perhaps. However, I've yet to read one book, on the subject, worth the price. Please, do yourself a favor and use the price of this book as partial payment for a Red Cross course. Very much of the content is common sense, and more important, time is valuable - don't waste it on this."
3,Lots of Information,"There is a LOT of information in this book. I would dare to say almost too much. It's not very easy to distill things down into more consumable chunks. There is a lot of emphasis on food storage and not quite as much as I would have hoped on ""survival skills"".To me, it seems to be geared more towards a ""catastrophic disaster"" or ""end of the world"" type scenario. And for that purpose, this is a great resource."
4,nice basic guide,"This is a nice basic guide with an overview for some overall preparedness. A good guide if you have no clue for emergency preparedness. Being a paperback, it will be easy to take with you and keep accessible to check often. Easy to find info."
4,Serious Preparation Advice for the Serious-minded,"This book gets four stars, because although it is a very well researched and practical book, it is probably, as some other reviews have observed, strong on food preparation, needs and preservation (very important) but a little light in other areas.I do think, however, this is an excellent book and for anyone who is keen to inform themselves and prepare for crisis management beyond the 72-hour disaster scenario and wants to be prepared for ""long emergency"" scenarios, I think this book is indispensable.It is a very serious book and has some indepth and quite complex information. It is by no means something written for the armchair survivalist.It is not what I'd call light reading, either, nor should it be.If you have a serious interest in crisis preparedness, this is an excellent book to have."
2,Dissapointing,This book has very little practical information on too many subjects. I have read much better books with more practical information in fewer pages.
3,not overly informative,"Has very few, if any, ""original"" ideas. Decent overview, but no real revelations at all."
2,Actually Believes The Official Story of 911,If someone is going to write a book about Crisis Preparedness they should at least do their homework. Fear mongering about terrorism and the U.S. Government Approved boogiemen is quite lame. More people die each year from peanut allergies than from acts of terrorism. If your going to write a book about getting prepared it should be about the Police State we now live in. This guy actually thinks the Patriot Act is a good thing. How some people get published is beyond me.
3,"Music Effects are OK, but there are not 100 of them.","Despite the line ""Over 100 Music Cues and Effects"" on the back cover, the CD for ""Music Effects Vol. 1 & 2"" only contains 51 tracks. The enclosed booklet lists 90 tracks. Evidently tracks 52-90 must be on Vol.3 & 4 (or lost in the trash basket).As far as the tracks on this record are concerned, they are fairly good quality and could be useful to someone making theirown movies or slide shows.There are 13 drum tracks, 5 with solo piccolo, 3 with solo flute, 6 with solo harp, and the rest feature a small ensemble. The piano is featured in 4, the flute in 10, harp and flute in 9, and seven combinations of opening and closing riffs on track 51.I liked these enough to want to purchase the rest of the tracks, if I only knew where to find them. The manufacturer (Gateway Recordings) and the distributor (RTV Productions) have apparently vanished from sight."
5,They just keep getting better1,"I love all the Law & Order shows and am impressed that they all continue to get better, with tighter writing, incredible acting and excellent story lines. SVU is my particular favorite as the cast is incredible, believable and have wonderful chemistry. I live in Alaska where I do not get TV so I'm always thrilled when a new one is released. Don't be so long with the next season!"
4,sweet,"love it, benson, fin, stabler, munch, cabot and cragen all rock. i get completly sucked into this show for hours. Rang in 2008 watching it and no problem with that"
4,can't really complain,"dvd was in good condition... but the box was a little more beat up than expected. but it got here super quick, so I can't really complain all that much."
3,Review,"I never actually received my item due to a shipping mix up. However, I did get my money back quickly."
4,Great video,We love this series and it is great to be able to go watch our fav episodes any time.Anyone who likes this season should continue will all seasons
4,i like this book,I found this book very interesting and with precious information regarding adjusts and settings of important parts of a bike.
2,Not that great,"Pretty lame if you are planning to actually work on your bike opposed to reading about or thinking about doing it. Covers a lot of things in poor detail, so little detail that you could not do it with this book alone. Example: want to install some disk brakes? No way with this book. It also includes info on how to work on really old bikes and outdated equipment. I bet you are dying to know how to work on centerpull road bike brakes which were last made in like 1981! Your're in luck b/c that is covered pretty well. Save your $$ and buy another book."
5,Great resource,"I've had this book for two months now. It is completely covered in grease and has taught me a lot about my bike.I still use Park Tool's website, Sheldon Brown's website, and youtube videos, but having this right there at my bike is a great help. Between those resources I eventually get everything figured out. I'm saving way more money than this book costs in repair and service charges already."
3,"Good for basics, no so much for even somewhat advanced","I'm former bike shop manager and longtime mechanic. Somebody bought this for me as a gift. I thought even an old dog can always learn a few new tricks, but this book really has none for someone who already knows something about bike repair. I kept running into sections where the procedure called for bringing the bike to a shop. What good is that? If you need to learn the basics, this is a decent book. If you need to know advanced techniques, you'll be far better off finding the info on the web, either at the manufacturer's site or someplace like Sheldon Brown's site.Last weekend I saw my neighbor with his bike backwards on his new repair stand. I gave him the book..."
2,Good theory if your in the market for a new bike. Horrible if you want to maintain your bike.,"This book has little practical application, it's filled with lots of theory about how to size a bike, and frame geometry.It talks about what would be a good style of bike for the type of riding you do. There is a lot of discussion about various parts and what they are used for. There is almost nothing about maintenance, it frequently tells you to take your bike into a bike shop to get things fixed.Not what I'm looking for in a maintenance book, and not what I think most people are looking for in that type of book. You are better off buying the Big Blue Book of Bicycle Repair 2nd Edition if you want to learn about maintenance.If you want help purchasing your next bike, and want to know theory about sizing, and what to look for. Read this book, other than that, skip this book and save your money."
5,Good manual for the Do-it-yourself Fixer.,"The book gives a complete guide on fixing most major problems that a typical Bicycle may encounter and more. This book has plenty of picture that lead you from beginning to end of any repair. In addition, the book describes all the tools you will need to fix any problems. If you want more knowledge on fixing a bicycle this book is a good start."
4,Easier to carry than my orignal paper edition,So I can eliminate my paper version when I travel. Why do I have to have a specific ## of wpordssajfdhkasdhaksdh
3,Not for a beginner,"Having not fixed anything ever on a bike, Id say its not for beginners. I dont even own any tools so Im going back to the shop I guess. LOL It looks like a great book for someone who has or plans to get all the tools, its easy to understand and has great pictures too."
2,Disappointed in eVersion.,"My comments relate only to the electronic download version, not the printed copy. While the written info might be good, the VERY small photos are nearly useless. I am not sure the file I downloaded was properly converted from the written version and perhaps something happened to minimize the instructional photos. I would return it if I could and buy the printed version."
2,Covers everything -- but doesn't cover anything in depth,"The problem with this book is that it tries to cover every area of every kind of bike -- road bikes, mountain bikes, even recumbents -- in one volume, and as a result it spreads itself too thin.For example, the book will show you pictures of the different types of shifters and brake levers available on mountain bikes, but it has too little detail on any of them to allow you to troubleshoot (much less repair) the one you happen to have when it doesn't work correctly.This book is not useless, but it is more of a general overview of the different kinds of components seen on bicycles in general than a how-to-guide that will show you how to maintain and repair your bike."
1,"very disappointing, a waste of money","I decided to buy this book after reading the good reviews, I was looking for a fairly basic book to help me with bicycle maintenance and some easy repairs or adjustments, like how to adjust a rear derailleur, etc. I am very disappointed, the book is filled with technical language, there are a series of photos with little or no legend, which makes it very difficult or impossible to understand and follow the instructions, annotated graphics would have helped a lot instead.if you are a professional and familiar with bike repair, then this book probably makes sense, but then, do you really need this book?otherwise if you are like me, with very limited technical knowledge, you are better off with something more basic and/or better explained with helpful graphics."
2,"Mediocre, and confusing","Overall, am quite disappointed in this. It covers the necessary areas of the bike, but the pictures are kept at the end of each chapter in mini-tutorials that are totally disconnected and not well explained at all - quite confusing. Not very user-friendly. I keep returning to my old Zinn book to try and decipher what I'm actually supposed to do. Surprised it has such good reviews on here."
2,Is sadly lacking in pictures and practical tips.,I find this book to be very limited in its scope and doesn't take into account even simple tips on what seem like common problems. From now on i will be searching You Tube for videos on a lot of these tasks. This book was a big disappoint for me.
4,Great,This book is very easy to read and follow. Has a lot of detailed pics to help walk you through whatever your trying to accomplish.
5,Good Choice!,"I agree with Mr T., this is a darn good book for bicycle maintenance. The photos are excellent and the topics covered are extensive. Some fascinating things that I haven't dealt with yet. I love it. This book is going to be in my shop with lots of greasy fingerprints on it. :-)"
2,A book that will not teach you how to repair a mountain bike....,"Almost nothing in this book is explained clearly.Despite being a big book, it doesn't do it's job, you won't be able to understand your bike better.It's almost useless and very bad written.If I would knew how bad it is I wouldn't have bought it, even for [...].Don't buy it because it's not that is bad, it's beyond bad, it's awful..."
2,not for general use (no matter how thick the guide is),"Sorry folks, but unless you have a new, expensive, super-duper bike or you need to know minute details, skip on this one. The author goes into too much detail on useless points or obscure parts, but then skips more essential info (like on sizing brakes or finding the right headset. His response is ""talk to your local bike shop."" Gezz, thanks!).I would think the target for general purpose manuals, like this, are owners of ""frankenbikes,"" or cheapies. Yet, most of the detail in this book goes to higher-end setups and parts."
4,Bicycle Maintenance and Repair,"Todd Downes does a great job with this book. Subject matter in this 395 page book is very comprehensive and covers both road and mountain bikes. I am not a mechanical person at all! But with the step by step instructions provided, once impossible repairs or maintenance become manageable and you don't have to pay the crazy fees at the local bike shop. It is truly a great resource to add to your personal library if you enjoy cycling and keeping your machine in top running order. I would highly recommend this complete guide to anyone searching for a maintenance and repair resource."
3,OK but not mee,I found that this book had good information but not what I wanted. I needed to know how to not just how. It is a good starter book but not for those that want to see which screw to turn and which way it should go and what is supposed to happen.
1,Not that useful,"If you have to be told which way to loosen a nut, pay someone to fix your bike. I got this book from the library and was disapointed in the content. It had a lot of information, but when it got to the difficult stuff they tell you to seek professional help. If you know nothing and have no mechanical skills this is good book"
3,"It's ok, but perhaps a bit esoteric for beginners","Decent technical book, but he delves into detail that, while useful once you are experienced, is somewhat arcane for beginners. But a good reference, nonetheless, once you advance."
1,Book is garbage,This book is a joke. If you plan on repairing your bike this is NOT the book to use. Book is very vague and not to the point. Very general when explaining repairs. Pictures are terrible and black and white. Do yourselves a favor do not waste your time.
5,Pleased,The best used(looks new to me) book I ever bought. FFaasstt shipping. Great price. Full of useful info.
2,You're better off with an internet connection,"If you have an existing bike that is more or less functional and that you intend to maintain yourself, this book is OK. If you have a pile of parts and a frame and need to know something simple like ""how many links should the chain be"", it's absolutely worthless. And when it comes to actually repairing a broken part or building a wheel (not so hard, really), the author bails out and recommends finding a competent bike shop. There is nothing, NOTHING, in this book that can't be found on the web with a couple quick searches.Once again, Bicycling Magazine publishes a stack of filler and fluff."
3,Left me wanting a little more....,"This manual had good focus on the basics of bike maintenance. When I wanted to go into more depth on the assembly of the forks and frame head there was no information available at all. Basic items such as tightening torques, minor adjustments, troubleshooting was lacking. I would have thought these would be included a little more. The book did have outstanding value for the money spent and I still learned a few things... so it's a keeper."
4,On Target,"Because I do not have mechanical skills I often rely on help from friends and neighbors to adjust or tune my bike, which sometimes does not have a happy ending. Bike shops are time consumimg and expensive so this guide solved my problems.It is well organized and has sufficient detail with excellent pictures to thoroughly explain a problem and the solution. I highly recommend the book especially if you are not a bike nerd."
5,Mountain Bike Repair Made Easy!,"I have always thought it would be so much easier to perform my own bicycle maintenance but never took the effort to look into a ""how to"" book. After years of taking bicycles to the shop for tune-ups and upgrades, and not having a shop nearby, I decided to investigate the idea of ""self repair"" a little more. This book is what I needed to get the ball rolling and as the title states, this is a complete guide for at home repairs and then some... This book has made mountain biking even more enjoyable for me!"
5,excellent service,I had ordered two batteries for my kodak easyshare camera. The first two did not hold a charge. I contacted the Co. and with no problems was sent two more. The customer service is outstanding. Have no problem recommending them. It was a fast turn around to receive the new batteries.
3,Great but not so great,This program is awesom. The only problem is the interface is really slow. You need a really powerful machine to harvest the full power of Vue.
2,"Cute, but more trouble than it's worth.","Yes, it works reasonably well--especially if you spray it with Pam--but this particular design isn't a winner, at least not for pancakes. In my experience, it's been more trouble than it's worth. This is one of those things that has ended up being left in the drawer more than it's been used.Silicone Zone makes many excellent products. This isn't one of them."
1,JUNK MADE IN CHINA,"No words to express my disappointment when I received my RSR ENVIROMENTAL TESTER: its display didn`t work well, even after I replaced its internal 9 volt battery. This means that the factory quality control simple doesn`t exist. Next time will avoid buying electronics from a chinese unknown factory. Let`s see if Amazon refund my money or send me a new one that works."
4,Need different capsule.,"I am sure the product would achieve what I need it for, however the product upsets my stomach. I should have ordered the time release capsule. This allows it to pass through the stomach before opening."
4,A must for a visit to Monte Alban,This pamplet provides an excellent guide for touring the archaeological site of Monte Alban. It describes all the monumental architecture. This helps in labeling personal photos of the site.
5,So many projects,"I bought this for my father in law a few years ago for Christmas, and it's still his favorite. He's made just about everything in it. Beginners and advanced wood workers will find lots of projects. My husband made reclining deck chairs from it, and they look great!"
3,OK... Too Basic though !,"If you are a woodworker with zest, many of the projects are too basic and I wouldn't recommend this book to midlevel woodworkers.Good Enough for someone just starting in woodworking.."
5,Book review of Jessica Speart book,"I love this series by Jessica Speart. Mixes mystery with a little humor. The character, Rachel Porter is likeable and interesting."
1,quite silly in the end,"while I did finish the book, I must agree that the last 25 or so pages could have made more sense. To compare her in even the merest way to Evanovich is to compare water with champagne. The author is silly, silly, silly. I don't think I'll pursue her other books."
2,Preying on the border,"This was an interesting mystery, for two reasons. It does focus on the important problem of primate smuggling, but it was also interesting because the author chose, as a setting for this book, an area which she obviously dislikes very much. Most regional mysteries, such as those of Tony Hillerman, Dana Stabenow, and Nevada Barr, will leave the reader with a greater knowledge and appreciation of the people and the land of a certain region of the world. In this book, however, both the people and the land are hot, cruel, and dirty. Trust me, living along ""La Frontera"" is really not that bad..."
3,"Good characters, extremely unrealistic ending",This is the second Jessica Speart book I've read. Her writing style and characters hold up in both books. I found the story interesting even though the some of the things done to animals made me cringe. The characters were all very likable and entertaining. I would've given the book a much higher rating if it wasn't for the last 25 pages or so. I found the conclusion a bit hard to swallow. I recommend the book but don't expect to believe everything in it.
5,29 Ways to Make Any Family Work,"I do not have a blended family yet, however we are in the process of adopting an older child and bringing this child home with us permanently. The 29 ways can apply to families of all types. I appreciate the author's experience, her heart, and her love of family that comes through the pages of this book."
2,No Piazzolla,"Astor and his group do NOT play on this albumThe music on this CD is pleasant, but for me it lacked the fire and passion that I associate with Piazzolla.I'd probably give it 3 stars normally, but I feel that the packaging is deliberately deceptive - it's made to look like their other CDs that do feature Piazzolla's playing and they avoided any indication that this would be different. They lose a star for that.I can highly recommend the other Milan CDs I've heard"
1,Bland music,"I heard this piece at a concert and loved it. However, this recording had none of the fire and passion of the concert. I returned it."
4,Piazzolla brazillian version,"Only Astor Piazzolla could equal himself. A bandoneon virtuoso playing his own works, nobody could do better than him. However Four Seasons of Buenos Aires deserves a place of honour in the cd collection of Piazzolla's fans."
5,Paul Hart - Concerto for Guitar and Jazz Orchestra,"In my opinion, this CD is superb and genuine. To any John Williams (the classical guitarist) or NYJO fans I would recommend this CD very much. In 1988 I went to see John Williams play live with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra at the Barbican in London playing exactly the music that is on this CD. A night that I will never forget. A recording that will go very nicely with any comprehensive collection either of John Williams or NYJO."
1,"This will attach to the wall, but not your TV","You have to buy another part that attaches to this, and the TV. I haven't yet figured out what."
5,Really helps neuropathy,I take 2 of these a day and it really helps relieve neuropathy. Did a control test where I didn't use it and the neuropathy came back and then disappeared whrn Alpha Lipoic was used again.
5,Great Show!,"Excellent video showing all aspects of the hockey game! Loved how well HBO did with this! I would recommend to any sport fan, if they don't like hockey they are sure to like it after this."
4,Highlights should be longer,"This is a very good dvd about some good hockey games from the past. It is interesting, but the highlights should be a little longer on each game. Good dvd."
3,Where's the music?,"Great series, but big disappointment that for the DVD, HBO stripped some of the original music used when it was aired."
4,Pens 24/7,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. The dvd is great however the case that it came is was broken.
5,Great Movie For Pens Fans,"As a Pittsburgh Penguins fan, I really enjoyed this film. However, if I were a Capitals fan, I'd be a little offended that they're shown in such a terrible fashion. Granted if a team is on a losing streak, there's not much you can do to make them look great, but it seems like HBO made the Caps look even worse.I did enjoy getting to see the locker room and off-ice scenes of both teams' players. It was an interesting insight to how the players live, as most people only get to see them in the 60 minutes they play. It'd be nice to see more films like this, going behind the scenes of different teams."
5,Creepy as they come.,"I watched this movie after seeing a preview on another DVD. This one was great. Oz Perkins proves he can be just as spooky as his father, Anthony Perkins. He plays his role with the perfect mixture of pompous and creepiness. Billy Burke steps away from his Twilight role of Officer Swan and into a role that is very eerie. This is a thinking persons movie and not is at all what you think!"
2,Removal (2010) movie...,"It is a boring and confusing film....people commmit crimes and this guy goes around cleaning after them..... Kelly Brook appears on the cover, back cover of the DVD, right? She is a real estate agent that appears maybe 10 minutes at all in the whole film..... ha ha ha ..... She is as lovely as always but barely appears on the film. Not a great movie..."
1,disappointing,"I saw Jason Upton at Soul Fest this year and absolutely loved his music. This CD however, was very disappointing. It was reminisent of a not so great rock opera. Lyrics were very repetative and the message was somewhat prosperity gospel like and manipulative to the audience. Sorry, but big thumbs down."
4,Good for reflection,This CD was pretty good. I can't say it is the best I have ever bought but pretty good just the same. I wasn't overly moved by it like I thought I would be given it's discription.
5,Buen viaje!,I was very happy with my purchase. The book is in very good condition (as stated)and it was delivered quickly. I would purchase from textxchange again.
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with my copy of Buen Viaje Level 3. It was said to be in acceptable condition, but i feel that the book i received is less than desirable. The cover has been colored on and has a strange feel to it. Once opened, numerous pages are wrinkled and have underlining and highlighting all over. As I continued to leaf through it, I discovered some very innappropriate writting and other strange writing along the margins. This book has clearly been trashed and should not have been labeled as acceptable. It obviously is not!!"
1,Discrepancies not a few,"I must say, the grand deviance from the actual Biblical account makes it so very had to watch. Time and again it departs from the Biblical account. Additionally, hollywood paints God in a bad light, contrary to the truth that is written of him in his Word. This is common for hollywood to do, since it is primarily run by the devil's instruments. :-/I've give it no star if that was an option."
4,Nice looking and reasonably priced,"This toilet paper is well-made with very good chrome plating, and should last a long time. The roller is plated plastic. I would have preferred metal, but can't beat the price."
1,Horrible!,"The frame is not scratch-resistant, and it is definitely not durable. It came with a dent already in it, and the parts seem pretty flimsy. The bolts come covered in a layer of grease that you must remove before assembly. I really wish I hadn't purchased this."
4,Very nice but heavy,"I'm really enjoying my futon and mattress. I had it put together this weekend. The only problem I have with it is that it is very, very heavy. Oh and another thing after I ordered the frame I saw it for $60.00 less, was a little upset about that because I couldn't change my order. I think that if you're ordering something and it is the same item for less there should be a compare price icon that pops up. All an all it is fine."
3,"Great Performance, But...","My apologies up front - I actually meant to give this recording 4 out of 5 StarsWhile the Mravinsky/Lenongrad P.O. live performance is intense, I've concluded the 1960 recording on DG, which includes the 4th and 5th Symphonies as well on a 2-cd set, is far more satisfying and enjoyable from a recording standpoint."
3,Skips in odd ways,"Overall this does a good job but it skips portions of songs. Ever so often, using both CD and MP3, it will skip ahead a tiny amount and throws the beat in your head off. If I were to have the choice again I'd probably buy a competitor, but for the first CD/MP3 player I've bought it's okay."
1,Hprrible,"This cd player is the most horrible device i had ever bought. It cost me 50 dollars, and on the first drop, the thing broke, It took me around an hour to fix it. The mp3 cd player part of it dfoesnt work, and i have to punch it until my knuckles are sore half the time because it says ""NO DISK"""
1,Olny had to drop it once,"I got this new mp3/cdplayer a while ago. Withen the week I had droped it once, and the thing broke. The other cd players I have had would last million of times of being droped. This one dident. If u would like a mp3 player if I was you I would look a an older one and the revews for it."
5,Faith Lost,"This is Kenny's sister, Tina. I have personally experienced this pain with my brother and knew what he was feeling. As a licensed clinician, it was hard not to be able to help him in the many ways I have helped others. I am so proud of my brother and the job he has done with my neice, Desna. This book is a wonderful testimony of his growth and strength. My sister-in-law Margie was a wonderful and beautiful woman. We love and miss her, Martha and Matthew (whom I never met). God bless you Kenny and Desna. This is definitely healing with heart.Tina"
3,Ok,"I don't like horror movies that much, but I can say that this one kept me alert the whole time. This is an independent horror movie that I didn't mind watching it. The effects are not bad at all, and the acting as well.*Sponsored Post"
5,Flight-A Celebration of 100 Years...- by Goodyear et al.,"This is an excellent reference work on the evolution of flightfrom the Wright Brothers onward. The authors explore theexperience with the Aerodrome and other famous flight attempts.There are short poems written by John Magee, Amelia Earharton Courage and others. There is a complete diary of the firstflight including wide-angle turns, ups/downs and rudderproblems. This work is perfect for a class project in scienceor history. It would make a great gift for a child up throughthe teen years."
5,Great View of German Defensives Works of World War II,"This book covers a vast topic in a short space and does not bore the reader with tons of useless information on how much ribar and concrete was used or other technical engineering data. Everything from the various types of bunkers in the first fortifications built after World War I to the giant submarine pens and air raid shelters are covered. There is even information on the minefield barrier in the Gulf of Finland and obscure German defensive lines in Europe as well as World War I era defense brought back into service. Certainly there are books that give greater detail on the Atlantic Wall and other indvidual fortifications, but this one is loaded with enough information to give a great overview. Main shortcoming is that the photos are not of the highest quality and some of the wonderful drawings appear to have errors in labeling, but there is no problem in interpreting them properly. Excellent work and well worth the price!!!!"
5,Good book on German Defenses,"After reading Wilt's book, I was disappointed since it lacked the detailed description of German fortifications. This book provides more information on the Atlantic Wall in regards to technical detail, but it is still only a general history and description. On the other side of the coin, it covers many German fortifications that I was unaware of and is reasonable well illustrated. I am not sure I would call it an introductory work since it goes a bit further, but like the authors' American book it covers so much it can only be considered an introduction, but an excellent starting point."
4,An eye-opening perspective.,"I have read many books about the Lebanese civil war but Ms. Makdisi's book is by far one of the best. It helps provide a unique perspective and a much-needed understanding of the Lebanese civil war and a generation which lost everything that the rest of the world takes for granted. Indeed, war only looks easy from far away."
4,Great Extreme Kayak Material but not best screen quality,"This DVD is one of the best of kayaking DVDs. One star minus is because of the screen quality of the DVD. I imported this DVD to Germany (~30 + 5,50 toll payments). Maybe the Quality is a lower one because of the NTSC format? I never imported a DVD before.The shipment arrived after 4 weeks and thats ok for overseas delivery.However, i am really lucky about this purchase.regards from Germanychris"
4,Good movie,Once again Steve Fischer awe's the world with his amazing whitewater skills and great versatility and experience. I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciated the sport
2,A rather painful experience,"Some people like Tanenbaum's writing style. Other people find his work tedious and boring.I belong to the latter group.Most of the book is just waffle... he explains neither the general principles nor the implementation specifics in great detail, but instead spends 10 pages explaining the obvious, follows that with a page with good technical information, then a page of insightful commentary, but then continues again with another 10 pages of pointless chatter.Some chapters provide practical information, but it is clearly aimed at the university student -- and has all the excitement of a monotonous lecturer.If you're after a to-the-point summary, try something else."
2,Where are the algorithms?,"This is an introduction to the subject of distributed computing. From my personal point of view fails the book to address any of the two viewpoints I am interested on: 1) Distributed algorithms, or 2) Distributed computing tools and software (i.e. real life examples with some source code).Although, some people can find that the book is a good introduction to the subject, I feel that the book is not focused enough.For distributed algorithms I recommend ""Distributed Systems: An algorithmc Approach"" from Ghosh (I have not read yet the ""Distributed algorithms"" from Lynch et al).For the ""practical"" aspect... I have not found a good one. Do you know one?"
1,Not worth to read,"I hope to choose 0 star if I could. I agree with one of the reviewer said the book loses it's focus. For example, the way it introduces Java RMI is very disappointed: it neither clearly described the idea very well nor the implementation. Therefore you end up learning nothing. You would say this is a academic textbook but in contrast, the Silberschatz's classic ""Operating System concept"" does the RMI introduction pretty well."
1,too many junks in the book,I have to say it's a book full of junks and gaudy texts. The author wants to cover all the topics in this field but he ignores the readability as a scientific reader. Most of the time you may find all the texts are lack of focus.
3,Average for Demetri,"I know it must be difficult being a stand up comic - you must continually develop and perfect new material. I had seen this comic on television and thought he was very funny. He still is, probably, but this DVD was almost all the same stuff seen previously. Maybe it was my fault for not doing enough research?"
5,Nice,Very nice watch to have. Esp for the people who likes chronograph and leather belts. I love diesel and especially the deal that i get on amazon. Recommended watch. can be used for casual or formal wear.
1,Didn't Like it.,"I'm a James Earl Jones fan. I have't seen a film with him in it I didn't like, till now."
2,Dissapointing,"The book is written entirely in the present tense, making it utterly unreadable. I consider this extremely poor writing."
4,the book is Real Simple - but don't let that deter you,"This book reads extremely fast. The page layout is attractive (just like the magazine), but alas this arrangement includes a lot of white space. Many of the tips are too familiar, e.g., sprinkling lemon juice on your fruit salad to prevent browning, and some advice is applicable only to homeowners or parents (I am neither - yet).Still, there is enough novel advice to make this volume worthwhile for a poor student who appreciates tips for organizing and entertaining. I recommend this for a housewarming gift.note: book is hardcover."
3,Happy but not impressed!,"Being a 28yr. old woman, who is not very domestic, I love the book and learned a lot. I would describe the book as a personal/household, ""how-to"" book. The book features checklists for grocery, kitchenwares, chores, home and auto maintenance and cleaning. It tells the best way to remove stains from everywhere, to do laundry, to decorate, to paint. And they give some quick/easy recipes. However, I don't think experienced moms and dads would be that impressed with most of the info!"
2,Not as good as I thought.,This book didn't have enough ideas in it for me. I do like the magazine but this book didn't seem to give me as much of a collection of ideas as I expected.
4,Very useful!,"Mister Jarislowsky is one of the great gourou of the stock market. Known for his integrity and straigth talk, he isn't affraid of telling the truth. His stock market approach is clear and simple: buy super quality enterprises who sell products and services than you will consume every day no matter the economical context. Whether in recession or inflation, people still buy grocery, drinks coca-cola, and smokes. They still find the money necessary for their ""basic"" needs.This is THE classical approach taked by everyone who has achieved financial wealth in stock market.Time and patience are two essentials keys to succeed in investment!"
1,Not practical for most people,"As a professional investor and avid reader of investment books for the last 30 years I would say that I found nothing new , interesting ,or practical for most people, we all know that compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.For me it was a waste of time and money!"
4,A step backwards for the S/A series...,"...but still worth reading.After the serious adventure in the last book, WE DIDN'T MEAN TO GO TO SEA, we have the Swallows and Amazons back in the pretending and exploring mode. The major difference this time is that they're completely on their own, since the Swallows' parents were so impressed with their responsibility in the last book.We get John's growing sense of responsibility toward the others, and some of the pains of growing up. We also get a boat race, some pretend-cannibalism, and a serious problem when some of the kids are trapped by a rising tide.The scenery and setting are well-described; one really gets a visual sense of where they are and what they're doing. Some new kids, the Eels, are introduced, and are fairly interesting, but are never seen again in the course of the series.Next: The D's return in THE BIG SIX."
3,A slower paced Ransome,"After writing some of the most thrilling children's stories ever (including those featuring a certain H. Potter), Ransome slowed the pace with Secret Water. Actually, the plot is just a bit feeble and while it has its moments of excitement, this may be the weakest of the Swallows and Amazons series. I read it directly after We Didn't Mean to go to Sea and Great Northern and it lacks their power and drama. Yet in Secret Water the reader is among friends and that, plus the usual Ransome writing skills, make it well worth reading."
2,tides and mud,"This is my least favorite Swallows & Amazons book. The Swallows, Amazons, and new friends the Eels are mapping the islands and channels in a tidal slough. This means waiting for the right tide, sailing somewhere, getting stuck a lot in the mud, taking bearings, and racing back to camp before the tide goes out. Repeat for five or six days. I wish they'd gone with Nancy's idea of a war instead!The surveying and the illustrations of the map in progress are interesting, but you need the completed map (in the front cover) to follow Ransome's vague descriptions, and that map reveals many plot points, spoiling any sense of tension."
2,Skip it,"Recommended only to colelctors who need every quasi-Rush-related object regardless of quality. I thought it could be decent background/ambiance music but:1) The performer (if there is one), though technically precise, does not have a very good feel for the instrument;2) Mediocre synthesized piano sound;3) I would not be surprised if these are just midi files downloaded from the internet, slightly modified and run through a computer.In retrospect, I'd pay about three dolars for it at most as a novelty piece for annoying my girlfriend. If you are looking for a similar album, the various string tributes, despite all their shortcomings, tend to be better done."
1,Brian McDonald,"As a lifelong fan of Rush I must warn anyone against this CD.I own all the other tributes to the band, both good and bad, just for the sake of having them as a novelty. I wish this was never made. Sadly someone could have done justice to a piano tribute and it could have been great.This one sounds like a grade school music teacher playing a Schroder toy piano with one finger while reading sheet music transposed by someone who has never heard of the band. Each song sounds as if it was recorded in one take regardless of any performance mistakes or disregard to timing, scale, or measure.It truly is a shameless attempt just to make a buck and unfortunately it had to drag Rush's good name to it. If it was possible to sue whoever in their management that released permission to use their material for this I would."
3,This hits the wrong chord,"Whilst the noblest of attempts, I strongly suggest poking your ears with sharp surgical instruments as an alternative to listening to this cd. This clattering, clinking, calamity of quantized piano simply hurts the brain.This display of technical ability is robotic, heartless and without an ounce of soul. Rush is all about the balance of heart and mind, and this refuses to adopt any of these sensibilities.I can only wish these artists success, but not for recording this. Next time try some warmth, a little bit of reverb to make it feel like a room and not an operating room, and certainly more interpretation."
3,Interesting take on RUSH,"I must admit that I have given this a good listen or two...certainly an interesting take on the music of the Canadian power trio. I have some of the other classical treatments of their music but this is the first piano tribute I have run across, with that being said it wasn't bad but certainly won't be for every RUSH fan. I had a credit for the mp3 store and this is what I ended up buying, certainly interesting but not something that I would listen to unless the mood strikes."
5,Great Translation; wonderful teaching tool,"I studied Midrash Mishle with Burt Visotzky in a class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. Rabbi Visotzky has dedicated his life to this text and it shows in this translation, which makes this particular midrash accessible to the English speaking audience. The stories in this midrash are superb and Dr. Visotzky footnotes all known manuscripts and their variations.If you liked the Book of Proverbs, you're sure to enjoy the Midrash on Proverbs!"
4,A Forgotten Treasure,"The Goose Woman is blessed with one of the great unsung performances on film - an extraordinary piece of acting by Louise Dresser in the title role - a drunkard ex-opera singer who sees a chance to return to public attention by concocting a story about a nearby murder that inadvertently throws suspicion on her son. When in Sunset Boulevard Gloria Swanson uttered the immortal lines ""They didn't need sound - they had faces then,"" she could have been referring to Ms Dresser. She displays the gamut of emotions without resorting to the histrionics that were so common in silent melodrama. The film predated the Oscars - one can imagine that Ms Dresser would have won the acting trophy hands down had it been awarded in 1925 (when the film was made). That the print is poor is more than compensated by her wonderful performance and the opportunity for film goers to see this lost classic at all."
3,lol,"just childhood memories there. B class. this is supposed to be the 3rd movie of the series, but i never saw the first 2. took me years to remember this movie and by chance i came across a trailer and i looked for the movie."
1,horrible,do not buy this game.. I thought it would be cool and fun but it was really retarded and hard to play. Maybe I need more of a gaming stick attached to my computer?
5,GREAT,This is a great Christian band. They are very talented kids. Perfect for any teen/adult Christian rocker. I love it!!!!!
1,Pretty Woman La La La??,The songs on this CD have nothing to do with rock n' roll.The versions of Pretty Woman/Spanish Harlem are the worstI can imagine. The others just as bad. Save your money.
1,Misleading product photo,"The photo shows four containers, each 9oz. The product is actually only one 9oz. container. Very misleading, possibly intentionally so. Also, shipping costs $10 for a $9 product? Give me a break! On top of it all the chocolate is nothing special, you can get 16oz containers of Ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for $10 which tastes better."
2,impossible to melt,"I bought the Ultimate Dark chocolate because I like a high % of cocao, and less sugar. According to the ingredient list, this should have been a great hot chocolate, but of all the chocolates I've tried, this one just wouldn't melt and mix with milk properly!! I don't taste the chocolate when I'm drinking it, and find a half inch of chocolate at the bottom of my cup!! I've tried other hot chocolates like Mariebelle, Ghirardelli, Teuscher, Lindt, etc... and never had this problem, so it makes me wonder why the Ultimate is different."
1,a way too long novel,"do not read this book if you are a surfer and don't want to read a long book. Ya, it was touching but, it was long..."
5,excellent reading,I read this book from the library and will be purchasing one to keep. Reading this book makes you appreciate what you have in life and makes you realize how lucky you are. It amazes me that people lived through such terrible times.
1,Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank Family [Hardcover],I purchased this book used. I don't believe it came from Amazon. Online it stated the book was in good condition but when I received it I would not consider this book in good condition. I have volunteered in school libraries for several years and with all my years handling and repairing books I would not consider the book I received as in good condition. It appears there was once water damage which usually leads to mold and the binding is no longer glued. I had planned to donate the book to my junior high school library but due to the condition I have decided not to and I doubt I will purchase another used book sight unseen.Diane Kinsel
3,Cheap product,"Not that the average Halloween costume is well done, but they could have done better than a foam hat with bad gold foam accents hot glued on. The cape was awesome and billowed beautifully, but I had to safety pin the chain to it so it wouldn't fall off b/c the glue failed."
3,Cute!,I bought two sets and these butterflies are super dooper cute! They look just like they do in the photo! The only reason I only gave them 3 stars was because of the shipping costs! I think it's really ridiculous that it only cost them $2.00 to ship these(said so right on the package) and yet they charged me $10.00. I could understand doubling the cost or something but charging FIVE TIMES the actual shipping cost.....kinda greedy!
4,Cuteness,Love my magnets. Unfortunately someone else loves them too and stole one of them right off my car while I was in the store shopping.
3,Good survey,It's a good book if you want to have an overview of the general philosophical and cultural atmosphere of the time.
1,Two together not worth a damn thing,"Two together not worth a damn thing. Your spit will produce a stronger spray than this flimsy showerheads. Logically, you don't need two to perform the function of one. So stay away from this useless product, else you'll be pacing right behing me."
1,What a nightmare!,This think is a nightmare hooked it up and it showered my bathroom not me. It was awful. It had this puddy stuff to go on the screws it was just plastic poor construction. I recommend the Waterpik line it is much better.
3,good idea but poor construction,"i like the 3 way diverter, and bought this unit basically for that. just to reiterate some points others have commented on:1. water pressure is very good on both hand shower and showerhead.2. cheap plastic construction that breaks easily, especially if you tightened it too much, the connector will crack and start leaking.3. the hose is plastic, not metal, so it doesn't stay down.overall i think this is a good combo. despite the obvious cons, I am keeping it for the water pressure."
4,So many options - IF you can reach them!,"I love all the options on this, however, you have to get to the mounted head to switch modes to hand-held. I am 5 feet even, so this is a challenge, and standing on the side of the tub while wet is just slightly dangerous. It would also be nice if the hose on the hand-held were longer, but it seems to be pretty standard.It also increased the water pressure in the shower significantly - an unexpected bonus! All in all, I strongly recommend this product."
4,Great for the money,Looks great and works pretty darn good. The holder for the hand shower head could be better. It does not secure it very well. And I wish the stationary head had a swivel mount.I'm happy with what I got. For a dual shower head under $30 I can't complain.
1,Total waste of money!,"I bought this showerhead because I wanted the two showerheads. However, this one was a total disappointment. The biggest problem is that the main canister is inbalanced. Basically, when you place the handheld showerhead in the holder, the whole thing tilts to the right. On top of that, even after using all the tape and rubber rings provided, some of the connections still leak. Also, the cord for the handheld showerhead is actually plastic even though it looks metal on the picture, so it sticks out and gets in the way. The only good thing I can say is that the water pressure seems to be pretty good. I am uninstalling it and returning it today."
5,Cheap. Works.,"This is a good model if you:Are looking for something on the CHEAPKnow how to remove restrictorsHave good water pressureare a teflon master.If you meet those qualifications, this is your savior!"
3,No OFF position,This might be better if the handle had an on/off lever. How do you wash a pet and turn off the water while scrubbing the pet or your body? this device seems to wastes water!
5,Wonderful,"Love this shower head. Makes showering like a spa. Easy to use, and a great addition to the shower."
4,Nice Product and Easy Installation,"I just ordered this shower head and put it in my guest bathroom. Being a single mother, I found it was not only easy to install, but it came with everything needed and took me approx 15-20 min. Everyone who has used it, loves it. It has four different water spray modes on both the handheld and the stationary heads. The hose is plenty long enough. It also helped increase the water pressure as some other review had mentioned. I only gave it four stars because it seems to be made out of chrome painted plastic so Im not sure how long it's going to last. Even if I get a couple years out of it, I will have gotten my moneys worth. I think it's every bit worth the price."
1,Peerless is useless...,"What can I say about a product that was broken right out of the package?The item was easy enough to assemble but the attachment that is supposed to screw on to the goose-neck pipe refuses to tighten. Therefore, it's wobbly and loose so when I try to put the hand shower into to the hook it falls down. Also when I turn on the shower, water sprays out of the loose attachment and water splashes everywhere.The Peerless Four-Spray Hand Shower and Shower Head Combo is a dud or maybe I got a lemon. I sent mine back so save yourself the hassle and don't buy it at all. Stay away from this one."
1,pure crap,"great idea, horrible construction. works great for about 3 weeks, then seals actually break. replace those, then 1 month later the hose bursts. complete junk."
5,Good product,Good product for the money. Works fine. Mostly plastic. Need to be carfull with installation (do just what instructions say and you will be fine).
3,Impressed,I am very impressed by this shower head combo. The only downside as others have mentioned is that when both the handheld and the fixed head are used the water pressure is not as strong. However I love being able to take a shower with my 2 year old without having to hold him the whole time. When the showerheads are used seperately the water pressure is great and I would absolutely recommend this.
5,best tv for the price,"I've been wanting to buy a 1080p tv for some time now, but I was very limited on budget. This tv had exactly what I wanted for half of the price of similar Sony's. The picture quality is amazing, despite the slight ""rainbow effect"" that a lot of DLP's have. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a great tv, but doesn't want to spend their childrens' college fund on it. :)"
1,Problems from the start......,"Like all smart consumers I researched HDTV's for months before buying. The TV did take longer than expected to get delivered. The first couple days were great, awesome picture, loved it! Next couple days a huge black bar missing from the picture in the top left corner. Next couple days the TV turned on but with out sound. And the final straw was when the T.V did not turn on for 2 whole days!!!! All we heard was a buzzing in the back of the T.V. We did send it back 32 days after we bought it and Amazon was pretty quick at pick up and refund. Samsung said we just got a bad T.V. I dont know what type of TV I plan to buy now!"
2,Light Engine Problems,"Before buying the Samsung DLP sets do a little research on the problems with the light engines. Ours has been out for a month and they can not find parts to fix it. Samsungs customer service is horrible. When they work, they are great sets, but replacing a $1200 part that was not built properly will ruin your experience. We are lucky and ours had failed the first time under warranty. We are hoping they have the problem fixed, but make sure you ask questions about this issue and get an extended warranty."
4,Super TV!!!!,"I would give this TV 5 stars, but I took away one star because I can't get my husband away from the tv. The high def channels are AMAZING, perfectly crystal clear and even the non high def channels are great. I would recommend this tv to anyone, great value for your dollar."
1,headache from hell,"when i recieved this item, i thought great, its time to enjoy tv again.. boy was i wrong..since this tv has two screens glued together it came from the factory showing on the screen erasor like marks in the middle of these screens...customer support sucks and since it has come from their factory they wont repair there own workmanship.......like i have said there customer support sucks,since i have paid regular price for this unit and not the refurbished price, i am really disgusted with samsungs so called customer service center...this came to me right out of the box"
1,Eagle Freight OK,I am feeling more forgiving about Eagle Freight's problems today and doing my best to retract this review. So far I can't seem to retract it or change the star rating.
1,Do Not Buy!! A complete lemon!,I have had this TV for less than 2 months and I am looking at a second service call. The first service call they replaced the main circut board and a few weeks later the TV quits again.Samsung's customer service is very slow and unresponsive. DO NOT BUY THIS TV or any other Samusung product.
1,color wheel,Color wheel is guaranteed to break in 3-4 years. The repair is expensive >$500. The lamps also have a limited lifespan and are expensive. I would avoid DLP tvs
1,Stay FAR away.,"This TV was shipped with a known defect that doesn't expose itself until after several years. White dots (pixels) begin to fill the screen until the whole screen turns white. This can take weeks or months. This is a result of the DLP mirrors inside the chip start getting stuck. I wrote Samsung and was told my TV was out of warranty and it would cost $400 to fix. I told them there are people all over the internet with this problem and that it was bordering on a class action lawsuit because Samsung knew about the defect and still shipped the TV's.They changed their mind immediately and fixed my TV for free, but it will just be another 4 years before the defect shows up again. By then I will have gotten my monies worth.You will buy this TV not knowing when the defect will start to appear. Get an LCD TV instead. They use less power and no bulb to replace."
3,I'm a little disappointed!,"More 3.5 starsFirstly, this really is a great HD TV for the money! I don't think there are better out there for this price. I researched for months before getting it.This TV is for HD viewing only (in my opinion of course). Standard Def cable TV looks like crap on it! Again, HD looks very good! SD very poor compared to my sony grand wega.I watched a HD movie last night(unforgiving) and hated that I could see the ""rainbow effect"" (mainly on the dark scenes) I know this is something that not everybody See's. But, I did and it sucked. I'm hoping it is more the movie and may not be as noticeable on all. (please don't let it be) :(I don't like the high pitched sound that comes out the back when the TV is off. Very noticeable though! (and no, not the fan when on)Again, this really is a great TV for the money. I just hope I get used to the whole ""rainbow"" thing."
5,"Great TV, Great Price","I spent about three months reseraching and looking around for the right hdtv. I ended up deciding that I wanted to go 1080p with 2 HDMI inputs to be ready for the new wave of HD content. This was the largest 1080p for the best price that I found anywhere (aside from a few online vendors with absolutely awful reviews). Amazon is a great seller, and if you are willing to wait (2-3 weeks) for the free shipping, that's a plus, too. The picture quality is amazing, even with Cable broadcasts only capable of 1080i, and standard tv does not look nearly as grainy as I expected. When hooked up to an xbox 360, the resolution is absolutely amazing. If you are a gamer, sports fanatic, or just like watching your favorite shows in HD, I highly recommend this TV."
5,As Advertised,"This 50"" Samsung is all that it was advertised to be. It was easy to set up. Light weight but alittle bulky, you need two to carry it. Visual instructions made connecting the jacks and cables very easy. The picture is outstanding even without an HD signal although skin tone is alittle pastey at times. Once my service provider is able to send more of the channels I watch, I will definitely make use of the HD programing."
5,"Great product, excellent shipping.","Selected the free shipping and was pleasantly supprised. Very speedy delivery to the backwoods of northern Michigan. Arrived in great shape. The picture is amazing, makes you want to watch everything in hi-def."
1,nothing but problems...,"I bought this television in December. The problems occurred in March. I made a request to have a repairman come and he basically replaced everything in the unit. The problem was the light engine. Now that the parts in my tv are brand new, I thought my problems were well behind me, but I was wrong. After it was fixed 2 days ago, more problems occurred. When i try to change the contrast, brightness, etc., the settings would reset once I turned off the tv. Also, sometimes the tv won't turn on, it would just make this weird buzzing noise. The picture is now worse than before.For all the new owners, please advise that you will be dissapointed once it turns into a dog like mine did. The tv may work great out of the box and you may be tempted to write a ""5 star"" review on here shortly after viewing the tv, but wait until 2 months approaches and I guarantee you will have Nothing But Problems. Write a review after 2 months and you will see what I mean."
5,Samsung HL-S5087W DLP HDTV,"What can I say? Great TV, great price, great merchant. 100% satisfied. On time delivery - fast, too! TV totally damage free, all items included as ordered."
2,"Same problem, two sets, service on the way","Update: We've had this serviced and the thermostatic problem has been corrected.We actually came to Amazon to read the reviews on this model when we were shopping over two months ago. And the price was good, but it was available to us retail at a very comparable price. Having said that, the popular electronics chain from which we've purchased has had four visits from us in the past eight weeks regarding our TWO HL S5087W sets and their shared problem; they shut off indiscriminately.This is really disappointing; because the picture and versatility is very very good with this model and brand.We have followed the manual and have definitely checked the timer. An update when the service rep identifies the problem (and solves it....) The phone handlers were very professional."
4,I love it!,"This TV is awesome. Watching movies on this TV is great, with the widescreen aspect and the dynamic picture view is phenomenal for all programs, except for sports. I love the game mode on it as well. I have yet to test it on the PS3 though. That is the main reason I bought this TV, b/c of the 1080p resolution, which I can wait to see in action soon."
3,It's Ok,"First off, the company on Amazon shipped the brush quickly, and it was packaged in bubble wrap, so the company gets 5 stars. But the brush itself, I thought was just ok. It's a brush, and a bit overpriced for what it is. My daughter complained that the bristles were sharp and hurt her scalp."
1,Avoid,"Kososvo Crossing was a cursory and listless stroll throughthree thousand years of history. The two hundred and two pagesrestrict the depth and understanding of the topics brushed upon. The book lists historical events and assumes political and moral positions with minimal substantiation. The position that the ""population deportations of 1913-23, and in the population deportations in Eastern and Central Europe ordained by the Allies after WWII...These were tragedies on a massive scale: in terms of numbers, greater than Kosovo...Yet the point is it worked. It settled the issue."" (pg. 190), along with "" ...the Serbs would have settled the Kosovo issue, by ethnic cleansing."" ( ibid.) betrays a dangerous simplicity that permeates the book."
2,Kosovo Crossing,"This book argues that the foreign policy of the United States should be based on Realpolitic, and that the policies of the Wilson and Clinton administrations are misguided or at best selective, humanitarian attempts that were and will ultimately prove detrimental to U.S. interests. While general readers may find this book very readable, and the author mentions that widespread brutalities occurred during the wars in the former Yugoslavia, he does not fully represent or comprehensively counter, arguments supporting the Balkan policies of the Clinton administration and U.S. intervention. Furthermore, the lack of important details in this book, may suggest oversimplification to readers with familiarity on Balkan subjects."
2,"Read similar books 6,000,000 times before",I have read many similar books before.The book itself has very little to do with Kososvo at all. Tito for example gets less then a page. The way he ruled maybe a line. That he ruled by killing over a million Yugoslavians is never even mentioned.It is a study basically of the history of US foreign policy. Nothing very orginal or good either. Just some sweeping generalisations that would suggest that US foreign policy is purely a produce of the ideals of the current US president.
2,not terrible,"I found Fromkin's writing style to be unorganized. He has a lot of information to give (not all of which is dependable, by the way), but he skips around from the 20th century to the Middle Ages to all the time periods in-between, and quite frankly, I found it a bit hard to follow at times.Fromkin is very confident about his information, and seems to think he's a definitive source on the subject. The book left me with a feeling that I was learning from an expert in Balkan politics--but beware. As a soldier stationed in the Balkans I can tell you, that if you're basing your knowledge of this region off of this book--or any one book--you've only really scratched the surface."
3,Thorough review material,"If you have not been near a Biology syllabus in a while, this is the book for you. The authors do not assume that you know everything. The chapters cover all the major topics (the only supplementation you may need is diagrams such as those of plants). I found that the practice tests could have been better structured because the Ecology tests are separated from the Molecular tests without the common core section that's used in the actual exam. All in all, a good book - using this book alone I earned a score of 660!"
1,Flabbergasted,"When this book arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes. A book the size of a matchbook, and no clues in the description??? This is some kind of a joke. But, now that I have read the other reviews (sure wish I had done this first), I realize it isn't, it's real. C'mon Amazon, you can do better than this. Unfortunately, I am not going to spend $5.00 to send this $4.95 book back to you for credit. But I think you owe me something, in the interest of good public relations."
1,Mini-book!,"Product title should say ""Miniature Edition""! I ordered this book thinking that it was the full-scale version and now I have to pay shipping to return it."
2,Don't judge a book by its virtual Amazon Cover,"BE CAREFUL. Though the main information doesn't say it, read the editor's information carefully. (I didn't.) This is a ""miniature"" version of the book even though it's a hard cover. The material in the book itself is probably quite good but this edition is VERY small. I had no idea when I ordered. I should have guessed something was up based on the price. My girls wanted a copy so they could pretend it was one of their dolls' books!"
1,Whatta RIP OFF!!...PRODUCT NOT AS PICTURED!!....,"i will have to agree with SEVERAL other reviews when i say i was HIGHLY disappointed when i excitedly (is that a word?..ha...) opened my package only to pull out a book so small it could fit on a KEY CHAIN!!....NO WHERE in the listing did it mention a MINI version!!.....VERY misleading...and flat out FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!....this seller should be ""BANNED""!!...."
3,I Thought It Was Full Sized,"This is a miniature book that contains a stripped down version of the main points of the full length book of the same title. I thought I was getting an incredible bargain on the book. The little book is still a decent value, and is a helpful tool in grasping the main points of the book. However, when I bought it I thought it was the full book, and so was very disappointed, although it was kind of funny. The miniature book contains shortened interviews with Christian intellectuals, such as William Lane Craig, about issues that challenge the intellectual viability of Christian faith. The answers are solid and helpful, although not incredibly substantive in such a short version."
2,Warning!!! Not the full length book!!!,"I bought this item thinking it was the full book, but it's really a miniature version, which was pretty disappointing to me when I realized it. I think the website should indicate that this is a miniature (abridged) version."
2,Came up short in several ways,"Like several others, I did not realize that this was not a full version of the book.Beyond that, I really did not find the book valuable at all. I thought he created the illusion of exploring these topics open-mindedly, but once a cursory introduction of the ""problem"" was introduced, he seemed to race down the evangelical Christian explanation with little or no attention to major counterarguments or exceptions. Many times I felt I was led down a slippery slope, where each point led to the next, but none were well established and the topic was very one-sided.For many, you will love this book and find my review completely off base. But I approached this book as a philosopher who is a Christian, not as a Christian who wants to be aware of a little philosophy but has no real willingness to challenge core beliefs."
1,The Case for Faith,"Until this order, I have been very pleased with Amazon and your service. This time, however, was very poor. It took over a month, and at the conclusion I still had not received the correct book. I recieved a ""mini"" edition of the book which did not include the full book; it measured about 3""X3"". When I called to explain the wrong book arrived, the 2nd time I asked to order the version I wanted over the phone in order to avoid the same mistake a 3rd time. Unable to do that I reordered the book and again recieved a ""mini"" book. The person I spoke to on the phone told me the description of the book I odered said it was I small book; I checked your site 3 times to insure that I was correct in saying there was NO SUCH DESCRIPTION. I there fore had to do without the book as the class I needed it for had progressed too far for me to take part, along with the other two people I was ordering for."
5,WW11,"If you are looking for WW11 movies this is great. Lots of action. I remember this movie from my younger days. Takes me back everytime i watch it. Great quality, price and shipping was immediate. Would buy from this seller again."
4,exciting transitional album - underrated,"marc bolan seemingly oblivious to the publicity and t-rextacy of 1971-73 - created a new sound for his next album and, indeed, embraced change throughout the remainder of his career.. while many fans of his earlier music didn't follow him those that did were rewarded with some of his finest productions.. a mixture of funk, rock, and something else..."
5,Great system compatible with the rest of advent line,"My child has been using the clear hard plastic advent bottle since birth. He had used the slow flow nipple and changed through all 4 nipple stages. It has been a pain to clean 5+ bottles a day. With this new system: all I have to do is clean the nipple and the screw on lid. The liners are disposabel. TRAVELLING is a CINCH, On my two weeks vacation, all I have to carry is 2 tempo nurser and as 5 nipples, bottle liners and 2 sippees attachment. All I have to do is wash the attachments at night. BTW, the sipee ad on works with the system if you remove the no spill guard. In case you asked- why didn't I use other travel system.....my son would not feed on the evenflo and various brand nipples."
4,"I like them, but I prefer regular bottles","I bought these when Avent didn't have BPA free bottles. They worked fine, no leaks, and hardly any gas from the baby. However, when Avent started offering regular bottles that were BPA free, I purchased those. I have to say, I like the regular Avent bottles much better. They aren't more work, less in fact, and they aren't quite as big. If you prefer drop ins though, I'd reccomend Avent over any other brand."
4,excellent,"Most know Galt MacDermot from his Hair Score, but he had a lot of other work: check outCotton Comes to Harlem soundtrack.Macdermot worked on a pretty narrow line--pop infused funk. But what made it work is his genuine sense of the music. It sounded like stage or film music, but the basis of the grooves were straight out of both AM and FM music of the 1960s--real rock in the big sense, not a fogie hack's idea of it. .This is readily evident on this compilation, which pulls together two albums. Despite a few minor flaws--the guitar work sometimes has that pre-Sgt Pepper thinness--this is a great way to get exposure to Macdemots later work. Like rock theatre or well crafted grooves, this is a great album"
5,A Fun Game,"I ordered this game hoping it would be as fun as Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, and it was better! Good graphics, good sound, everything was great!"
3,Hit or miss,"My friends loved this game, but I could not get into it for anything. Maybe because I have no patience for my character to run around the forest aimlessly."
4,Review of my purchase,"Besides the fact that Amazon.com bungled the first order horribly and had to zer-charge a second order to get the item out to me, I am satisfied."
4,Good Game,"I bought this game because I first person shooter games, I already have this game so I bought this as a back-up. I like this game and I play it frequently."
4,Jedi Academy,"I have had this game about 2 weeks now, and here is what I think of it. The single player setting is fairly easy to get through (took me about a week and a half to finish all the missions). I had a little trouble getting the Multi-player to work on Windows 7. I ended up having to turn my User Account Control Setting off to get it to work. Once I did that, I was in business. Once I got the multi-player working, I was able to get online and play against other players (although some of the servers would not load). Having a BLAST playing capture the flag. Overall, a good game, but I would have liked the single player missions to be a little more of a challenge."
5,Love Jedi Knight,"Star Wars Jedi Academy is a lot of fun. I found myself unable to turn off my computer until I finished playing it. I completed Jedi Academy in a little over a week, playing about 2 hours per day on the average. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars. There is nothing like wielding a lightsaber and fighting dark jedi. I found that I rarely used the first person mode with a gun/blaster. The lightsaber was too much fun!!"
2,Too soft,"The pieces seem small, smaller when you chew them and they soften way too much. I should stick to mint without the bubblegum flavor. My teen likes the flavor enough to have eaten most the packs so I won't have to worry about it for long."
2,Retail Detailed: Secrets to Selling Retail Chain Stores,"Concept of book is interesting. Written from the retail buyer's perspective in a verbose conversational style that becomes tiresome to read. There may be some good advice in the book, but its just a chore to uncover. In the end, it may all boil down to the salesperson acting professional, knowing a few good jokes and restaurants, and then caving in to the retailer's demands. Price is cheap enough to try the book. Production quality is very low budget."
2,A mistake,"This product was the big mistake to purchase. When I got it and tested it, the tilt operations worked with no problem but the pan would not work what so ever. The instructions that comes with this product do not help at all. I tried to exchang it or get a refund but the seller would not work with me on the situation. I do not recoment this product."
4,great little unit goes a long way,"I bought this unit to use at my family reunion. I used it with my JVC DVcamcorder. Great range on the remote. Pan and tilt move effortlessly no bumps during movement. Battery life is a little disappointing, but it works great off AC. Overall, thumbs up :)"
5,Excellent Thanksgiving Story,"This book is an excellent way of sharing the first Thanksgiving with children. It is told from the perspective of the Native Americans, a perspective that is often overlooked. The illustrations are beautiful and help to tell the story visually."
4,Nice book about Squanto,"This is a nice book about Squanto, beginning with when he was forcibly taken to Spain and sold into slavery, through learning English and travelling back to North America to eventually help the Pilgrims as they established their new colony. Most of what I learned about Squanto was new to me.Each 2-page spread has a full page illustration. The illustrations are attractive in gold, autumn tones.There is a brief glossary on the back of the very last page, mixed in with copyright information, it's easy to mess. However, there is no pronunciation key which would have been very helpful for the names of the Indian tribes and individuals.Also be aware, this book doesn't really teach you much about the Pilgrims or about the first Thanksgiving, so you need another book for those topics, but this is a nice addition to a collection of ""Thanksgiving"" books for children in the elementary school years."
5,luminous illustrations,"I love the story of Squanto - a young man who endures incredibly bad situations, and still has the courage and dignity to help others. The illustrations in this book make Squanto's world come alive. Easy text - great for younger readers.Everything Joseph Bruchac does is excellent.My older readers also like ""Squanto, Friend of the Pilgrims"" by Peter Buchard."
3,The art in this book is offensive,"The Native Americans in this book, with the lone exception of Massasoit, may have brown skin and wear traditional dress, but their facial features are totally *white* -- Squanto looks straight out of a JCrew catalog. Since when do Native Americans have turned up noses? Please. The art in this book isn't just ""romanticized,"" it denies the physical bodies of Native Americans to the point at which it renders the accuracy of the text (and all it's good intentions) moot. Ugh. For much more interesting explorations of Native American history, I'd recommend This Land Is Your Land by George Littlechild."
3,The first Thanksgiving was in Virginia!,"Please visit the Berkley Plantation website, Virginia's most historic plantation to learn about the first Thanksgiving."
3,"It works, and that's all that's good about it","This thing was clearly designed by an idiot but it works. It's tedious to use, it hurts, the tweezers that come with it are garbage, and the buzzer is loud (but luckily it can be removed from the circuit without breaking it). Honestly you could probably just attack the probe directly to a 9v and it'd work just as well if not better. But I digress, the device does indeed work."
2,not worth the money,well- the same as the deluxe model- not working for me. BESIDES the time ( takes a lot of it)- it just does not work for me-i thought it was for corse hair- but it takes several times to remove one hair- you spent 3 minutes for one hair- don't buy it - waste of money
1,hair remoal,"Good looking product, however very poor quality, it removes the hair but takes on everage 2 hours to remove a single hair, so its impossible to work with very time consuming."
2,For coarse hair? Really?,I have used electrolysis at home kits before and it has worked very well for me...when it was actually for coarse hair. To say this product is for coarse hair is false advertising. I would not recommend this product to anyone with curls.
2,Too much work.,I'm not sure if this is working or not. The needle does slide in easy enough but it don't feel the electric jolt. The water with the salt is confusing.
3,The Salt Water Threw Me Off!!!,"It definitely works but the salt water makes it hard to focus on the root of the hair. If there is too much salt, it shocks too hard and too fast. The stylus sometimes moves in and out of its opening, making it hard to insert it into the follicle at times. If you miss your follicle you creat a huge gash in the location at hand. As a result of all this hassle, I will revert to seeing my cosmetologist :)."
2,Ok...if you have patience,"It's hard to insert the needle into the hair follicle, which I keep missing. I think it maybe better if I work on someone else."
1,Does not work!,Do not bother buying this! It doesn't work! I followed the directions just as they said however it did not work.
1,not for me,"I may have been using it wrong, I read the directions, but every time I used it it would leave red marks that take a long time to go away, and it didn't seem to affect the hair at all. I gave mine to my sister to see if she had better luck."
2,Candela,"Total waste of money! it hurts too much to be using this thing. plus it takes forever just imaging trying to get every single hair it is crazy slow and painful, it looked like it worked but I could only do three hairs on my chin, to me it was not worth it and it actually damages your skin so you have to wait a while for it to heal.so if you like pain or if you only have a few hairs that you want to get rid of, then it is just fine and if you don't mine to burn your skin. (i use it in a low setting)Clean and easy???? my aaaaa!"
2,Sizzle lean,This was a lot harder then what i expected to use so I cant really blame the product .. I feel its more of the way I used it.
2,Hair removal?,"I only used this on a small patch on my leg. Not sure it works, is a pain to use (need wet fingers with salt water), and left red bumps that took weeks to go away. I would not recommend."
1,doesn't work!,"the fact that it could take forever to use this product and get results is ok for me, but it didn't work for me at all. First of all, you have to use a salt water solution to enable the electric circuit, and this is a huge pain in the butt. maybe i wasn't doing it right because I hardly ever felt any of the laser shock that you are supposed to feel, even on the highest setting. I felt it a few times but the hair didn't come out effortlessly as it should when the hair follicle dies. so needless to say, I got no results, tried to use it many times, spent a lot of saltwater, and now I'm going to look for a product that actually works if I spend a little more money for it."
3,works but after you die,"this product really works but not on all areas, it works good for me on my lower arm, prepare your self befor using it because this device is super tedious device, so it's not for large areas or thin hair size, it do hurt a bit and it has an annoying sound and bad tweezer."
2,Ouch!,"Ok, I had used one of these in the past and thought I'd give it another try - I'm so tired of plucking chin hairs daily. You do need to keep your fingers wet with salt water - to get a good charge. My problem was that I had to repeat a couple times for the hair to loosen up enough to come out. The next day, my face was covered with raw open sores in the spots I treated. I had the sores for over a week, and then pock mark scars! I won't be using it again. To be fair, maybe my skin is more sensitive now - I don't remember this problem when I used it before. But just beware."
1,didn't work,I thought I was getting a tweezers system to remove hair but it was pads that kind of hurt. After a couple months of painful treatments I stopped because I didn't see any results.
2,"It works, but good luck replacing the tip","This seems to work ok. I've been doing electrolysis over the years, so far this gadget works, up until you have to replace the tip. You can't. I replaced one, and upon threading the needle through the tip, it bent. So that's one tip gone. Tried the second replacement needle. That needle fell out of the tip completely. So it's easier to just buy a whole new unit if you have to replace the tips."
2,Not for me,"Used it a couple times (or attempted anyway) and maybe its just a little too complex for me, but I wasn't getting any results except for a few uncomfortable red spots. I'm intrigued by the technology but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,total waste of money,"This did nothing. The needles kept breaking and it didn't even remove one hair, I returned it the next day. It was impossible to use."
2,Don't waste you money,Got this as a Christmas gift and couldn't wait to get started. Followed the instructions verbatum. Several times. Even had a friend of mine who does this at her job in a beauty sallon. Both of our opinions is that this product is a waste of money. Just save up and get treatments from a pro.
1,junk,"This thing is crap. Don't waste your time and money. Ridiculous in this day and age. I went to a laser center and got laser hair removal. Takes the nurse about 10 to 15 minutes to zap an entire area and it is done. Doesn't cost very much, either... Go with that and skip this nonsense! Big waste of money!"
5,Be prepared for what you buy,I have bought 3 of these over the years and I can attest they work as a charm. I have permanently gotten rid of my middle chest hairs and unwanted hairs in other places. It is also relatively unexpensive. The drawbacks are pain(no problem for me but if you are too sensitive consider using a xylocaine gel) and very very time consuming to do large areas. A trick I have found that helps lessen time needed and pain and scarring is take some instant glue and tip the tip of the stillet inside. After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet. This way the currect will go only to the root and not the rest of the follicle.
5,I have to like it.,"I have removed a decent number of hairs with this device, about 3000 hairs so far. It has a very high efficacy rate (99%+) as genuine electrolysis is supposed to have. I have good dexterity and patience and am still working with the original stylet, the spare remains ready. If this device meets your needs and capability it can indeed get the job done- very slowly. Go into self electrolysis fully aware, do research before you find out this proccess is not for you."
3,It works,but you need good light a magnifing glass and lots of time and start in a place that you don't care about mild scarring because it takes some time to get the hang of it.
2,difficult to use,"Not easy to use. Get scars and burn marks and hairs regrows. Might try it again may be need just some more practice, but i'm not confident. I think i prefer to have hair to shave than scars."
1,Horrible item,"This doesn't work,its a terrible machine and the needle bends so easily . I tried multiple times its so hard to get the needle in the follicle and the salt water is really annoying I was expecting more from this I want to refund this so if the seller can please contact me asap"
1,Way Too Painful,"I don't know how anyone can use this device. I only tried once, and it was so painful I couldn't keep the needle in long enough for it to work. Also, the instructions said the tip of the needle was supposed to be inserted inside the hair shaft underneath the skin. The picture in the manual made it look like the needle was a few millimeters under the skin, but I don't see how that's physically possible. The needle is thicker than the hair and there's no room at the base of the hair to insert it. Maybe I misunderstood and I was actually supposed to stab myself in the leg. If that's what you're really supposed to do, then it's just not worth it."
1,GARBAGE,"I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO MY GUT, BUT I DIDN'T I'M A VICTIM OF THIS CRAP. PLEASE PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND SEE A PROFESSIONAL!!. NOT WORTH THE MONEY,TIME & ENERGY!."
1,Difficult to use,"This product is way to difficult to use and takes to much time. I only successful used it to remove two hairs (took 20 minutes), which eventually grew back the next month. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Had high hopes,"I really wanted to like this. There is no way of telling if it's working. No light to let you know the unit is operational no noise to let you know it's on. It's a simple dial and you turn it but nothing happens. Really??? I know with the price ...what do I expect but honestly this was a huge let down. I had such high hopes that I would at least be able to use it but you can't even tell if the unit is working or not. I felt nothing, no current, no tingling, nothing. Cheap, mickey mouse junk. This is going back."
4,Puts it all Together for You,"One of the most valuable aspects of this book is that it puts together theories and research inclulding modalities, multiple intelligences, learning styles, etc into easy to read, all in one place, reference charts. Many good, adaptable differentiation suggestions for all content areas, and I was pleased to discover several that were new to me.....I've been teaching 8 years."
3,Repeated Information,"this book had a lot of information, but nothing that required an entire book to cover. there were a lot of ""methods"" and ideas to incorporate in the classroom, but the organization of the book made it cumbersome to follow the examples. If you are the type of learner who appreciates a ton of examples this would be a great reference."
5,Books by Lois Walfrid Johnson,"I am 11 years old and home-schooled. I LOVED all Ms. Johnson's books! I have read them all and I believe we have all the ones out except for one. All of them are great! The girls in her series are: Libby, Kate, and Bree. My younger sisters (8 and 9) are reading them and love them too! I really like how all the girls have faith in God. I cannot explain how good these books are! Thank you so much, Ms. Johnson! These books have really inspired me!Soli Deo Gloria!"
5,Goooooood,Heya!!I LOVE this book. I am 12 and I just started the series about a week ago. I learened about them from a friend and I just finished the third book. I love the story and I think if you think it is boring you are CRAZZY!!!!! Really I mean It.
4,ABC Border,"This border is very colorful with nice pictures, also plenty of border for several bulletin boards. Perfect for primary grade classrooms."
3,Heat may be a problem...,"This product works very well to hold the toll transponder in place. It sticks well but does occasionally slip off the windshield. I don't expect it to stay on all the time. I like to place it at the bottom of the windshield right over the steering wheel. It does not obstruct the visibility and if it slips, it tend to stay put. One issue though is the failure of the plastic holes that hold the rubber suction cups. With the South Florida heat and sun, it tends to melt the plastic and the thin part tends to break off (and i""m usually parked inside a garage). Mine usually lasts about a year so it's not too much of a problem. I bought two."
2,Not too good,This item does not work very well. It is too big for a standard toll pass device and would constantly fall off the windshield. I finally just call the state toll authority and they sent me new velcro tabs and I have not had an issue since.
5,Rabble Rouser.,"Who would have thought that a man with such an image was a gang leader, an instigator, a trouble maker and by todays standards could be charged as a terrorist. This was Samuel Adams as this biography tells it. This shows that one man's terrorist is another man's hero. It is amazing that Samuel could get so many people to follow him in such an idealistic venture as a countries independence. I do not think he could do it today, in America, because of the attitude of the populace. We are complacent now, maybe then they weren't. I think the were of the bent of Australian prisoners in Australia. They would fight over the smallest thing, thinking they were being persecuted. It is a well written book full of the history of one man who will live in history."
2,Vacillation style of writing like the subject of the book,"Because I like to follow a strong story line, I found Authentic Genuine hard to like. I realize the author, despite his thoroughness, had a lot going against him in a lack of cooperation from the main subject --Ralph Lauren, and others in his family and those around him. So he had to construct coherence from chaos. Like he mentioned in the beginning, ""a writer's job is to tease a narrative line out of events that can seem chaotic.""So I read here and there, picked pages, perused the ending. In the end I am left with a version of Ralph Lauren, if it really is authentic and genuine is incomplete. It asks me to believe an open ended assertion about Lauren that the author would rather deliver to a more candid and resourceful conclusion.The book gave me a choppy ride that I wasn't able to surf properly."
3,A Decent Book,"This book is an overview of Ralph Lauren's life and career. I thought the book started out great but then took a dull turn as you got into the growth of Polo. I definitely loved the story of his earlier years and the initial years of Polo as I found that to be inspiring. Nevertheless, as the book progressed i found it less useful.I recommned this book to anyone looking for an inspirational buisness success story. I would read the first half thorughly and them skim through the second half quickly."
5,Great Comeback Album,"Freddie is here to stay with this album. I truly enjoyed each and every song, which is unsual for me.A must-have album for all Freddie fans."
2,Recording Process?,"""Natural Thang"" - what a great song. I had to buy the album. One question. Where/how was this recorded? In someone's basement or an amusement park play studio? The quality is absolutely horrendous! And artists wonder why we are downloading from the internet? I truly wish I would have saved my $15 and recorded the song from the radio on an old cassette tape salvaged from the basement. An atrocity. I though Freddie had more class."
1,Pass on this one...,"I found it hard to separate the wheat from the chaff with this book. The useful information in this book is buried between unsubstantiated statements of fact and obscure references. I mean, the author makes it sound like everybody should know what ""acerola powder"" is, as if you could pick it up at the local market. I found his writing style to be preachy and pontificating, like a politicized tirade from Crossfire, where the ""other side"" couldn't possibly have anything of value to add to the conversation."
3,mob?,"it's a cool movie...a lot of action!mobs, crime,some violence and adults scenes.. but it keeps you watching it for sure!*** sponsored comment"
3,Learning spanish,"I bought this CD in order to help my language skills during the summer. The recordings were very well pronounced and and allowed time for you to repeat the spanish. If you already know a little spanish it will be much easier to fallow, and i recomend buying the cd so you can replay one section without hassel"
5,Awesome game,"Please don't listen to the other review. If you like this style of game then buy this one. This game is fun and funny. You play a pizza delivery boy how ends up at a a spooky castle. The game plays just like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. It is not easy but, just like the others with some time you'll make it through. Just put this in your cart and buy it."
4,Great manga program,"This is a great manga program. Really makes your manga look like ""manga"" with all their tone options and the 3D models are great if you can't figure out how to draw a certain pose.One problem though: Does not properly work with Windows Vista. Lots of missing strokes. I'm stuck having to now draw my manga in Photoshop and import PSD files into MS in order to be able to get anything accomplished. Very upset about this, I hope they release a patch for this or a fix or something. :("
4,Excellent resource for pattern construction,"Anyone interested in constructing repeating patterns, the history of design and ornament, quilting, M.C.Escher, geometry, tesselations, or mathematical concepts in the regular division of the plane, will find this hefty book an excellent resource. The historical examples are drawn from an astonishing variety of cultures, and following the exercises at the end of each chapter will give the reader a very thorough grounding in the subject."
5,Excellent Language Learning Resource,"I used the strategies and ideas in this book when preparing to go to China and study Mandarin, and I am now a fluent speaker of that language having spent just one year there.The most useful aspect of the book is the way that it helps you avoid wasting time and energy through bad languge-learning habits. The book is full of simple and practical ideas that made my whole language learning experience a lot more fun and effective.I would highly recommend this book to anyone serious about mastering a new language."
5,Traditional and STILL the Best of Its Class,"I remember when Joy cologne or perfume was found at many of the finer department stores. It was once billed as ""the world's costliest perfume."" I believe Procter and Gamble currently owns the company, so I am not sure why it isn't found more commonly in the United States, but at least it can be bought online. I love it and save it for special occasions; the light floral scent of roses is sublime and sexy. It is truly a timeless fragrance."
4,Memories,"It goes back to 1953--my husband spent the Korean conflict in Austria--he sent Jean Patou perfume to me. Since I could only afford what I purchased (the toilette), I found it more suttle than the perfume. I knew that when I made the purchase--but I still love it. The packaging is the same, the bottle is the same, scent is the same--MEMORIES!! The price is different."
5,Excellent resource book,This is an excellent resource book for those working with young adults. It's worth the price.
4,"great recipes, detailed instructions, some exp. required","I first got this book from the library, but enjoyed and used it so much, I just HAD to have it. The style is very personal, as if the author were sitting in your kitchen, chatting about the people and customs of Southern Italy, the origins of particular dishes, cooking hints, etc. He includes accompaniments and wine suggestions for each recipe. Although the preparation and cooking directions are very detailed, some cooking knowledge and experience is very helpful. I would say this book is not for the extreme novice. Also helpful are the discussions of typical ingredients and where to obtain them if not available locally, and the list of equipment."
4,Pretty good stuff,"I have used this for about a month now and it has saved me hours of work.The interface took a little getting used to,but thats probably cause I am new to working on the computer.All around pretty good.4 stars(there are a couple things that I want it to do but it wont.I probably just need to learn a little more about it.:)"
1,Window Vista Alert,"If your operating system is for Windows Vista I'd advise you to stay away from this program! I purchased this program in Feb.2008 and figured I had plenty of time to install it on my computer. Well, it won't install using Vista as the operating system. I'd probably wouldn't have had a problem if I was running it on my old computer, Window XP was it's operating system but I brought a new one. So don't buy this unless you check to make sure it'll run on your computers operating system! I'd rate this 0 stars since I can't use it but the system wouldn't allow it so it has 1 star!"
3,....................,"although it has many things that you dont need to buy in a store, it needs some other things, too. I bought it and had it in use almost everyday, but then got bored because is hard to find the tools and you dont wanna just have your front page fool of them. I heard that this software had some problems in a windows vista but i found the info after i bought it. still does not represent any problem to my computater. i have found that i need a tablet to work with it but a tablet does not work in a vista or at least a sheap one. one a comment from me buy it if you have a xp since that it was made for."
5,much faster & easier than other programs,"wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet.i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings.I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga."
2,mostly an advertisement for more stuff,"I purchased this item for my classroom. It comes with no printed instruction manual. Besides this incredible inconvenience is the fact that once the program is open, it can not be closed without turning off the computer. I have loaded it on my new classroom computer and had this problem so removed it an loaded it on a new tablet laptop with the same problem.What I have seen so far, rather than making this version accessible and usable, is about how they really think you should buy their more Delux version. There is nothing I have experienced with Debut that would encourage me to purchase their more advanced copy. Also, so far I have experienced nothing with this program that makes it significantly better for drawing than photoshop."
4,A little bit of everything,"When you go through the different mathematical Schaum's Outline books, you will see quite a few of the topics get covered in more than one place. For instance, here vectors, matrices, and probability (among other things) are covered here and in their own book. How do you choose? You have to ask yourself how much information you need. This book is not as detailed as others are.There are lots of solved problems here to help you learn to work the various problems. The explanations are fairly easy to follow. There are also supplementary questions for you to check you knowledge, and the answers are printed at the end of the chapter. You can either work from the answer to the question or work towards the answer from the question, whichever helps you.A very helpful book, but if you have other books from the series, you may be duplicating topics."
1,Just horrible quality - not worth half the cost,"I got this fan not from amazon and was surprised how cheap the quality of the fan is. The parts literally seem to fall off. It does not look any where as good as it does in the photo. I will be returning this fan. Also note, it makes a lot of noise if run on full speed (much more than other fans of similar size that I've experienced. The noise is not from the blades cutting the air, but from the motor itself."
2,Don't Bother,"I found the picture by picture style of this book not only anoying, but void of in-depth information. Premiere is phenomenally complicated. This book's ""Simple Simon"" approach shows how to do the basics step by step without explaining the fundamentals and technical information necessary to master video editing basics. My advice to someone who actually wants to LEARN Premiere? Don't try to take a short cut. If you need a picture book with step by step instructions to work through a software program, Adobe Priemiere is probably not the best video editing tool for you to learn. This book fails to explain the importance of the ""Render"" command thus confusing the begginer who can't understand why none of the technical tricks of the book are not working. In a nutshell, buy another book."
3,"Basic and well organized, yet slightly E-Z Cheesy","I have this book and feel like it is good for a beginner , easy to read and full of color diagrams to get you up and running. What it doesn't have though is meaningful discussions on various intermediate level techniques etc.It should suffice as a reference manual for someone who doesn't want to poke around in Premiere's own online help menu's or is missing the normal manuals and documentation.What is lacking in this book for me, was the sort of info I felt I needed a book for. There was no serious sidebars for tricky manuevers or off beaten path settings tips to really help me ""dig in"" to Premiere. I recommend some of bigger books w/ CD-Roms as the weightier titles for in depth settings advice etc."
1,Not a good buy,If you are like me you like a book that really gets you into it no matter where you are in the book. In other words if you are interested in the material at lesson nine that is where you start. Well this book doesn't even come close to doing that. I am an advanced computer user and pick up things easily. This book forces you to creep your way slowly through the lessons. Forget about looking up how to do a specific task. You may find this book usefull if you are an absolute beginner to the computer software interface. Otherwise I suggest you get something a little more advanced.
4,Its simplistic but worth the cash.,"Sure its simple, but if you need something that'snot then you could probably figure out Adobe Premiere 6without a book. I'm a 17 yr. old amature moviemaker and was somewhat stumped by Adobe Premiere. Iskipped about the first five chapters and went to the stuffI couldn't figure out on my own. It's step by step process took out the guess work."
4,"Good soap, smells nice","This is a good soap. I bought 12 bars, and it is going fast. The smell is reaaly nice, but it leaves the skin a little dry. Make sure to rince it off very well. I feel really clean with it. I mostly use it for my face."
4,J. Holbrook,"This book had excellent pictures and background information. For a resource to read before you go it is informative and helpful but as a resource on the ground it lacks some details. I did find the resources in the very back helpful. I used the book to plan the generals of my trip but relied on tour gides and local friends for the details. I liked this book, it was helpful and I'm glad I bought it but I don't recommend it to be your only resource on Taiwan."
2,"Nice pictures, but not so useful","This guide is full of pretty pictures and nice background text, but practically useless on the ground. For all the information that this book contains you will have a hard time getting where you want to go. Unless your destination is on the MRT (subway) or Taipei City buses, there are no directions. The maps are so general that only major highways are included. Forget trying to navigate street level. Worst of all, many of the destinations are named in English and the Romanized Chinese, but there aren?t any characters for you to point at when conversing locals. Taiwanese taxi drivers are great, but that won't help if you can't tell them where to go!"
2,National Geographic Traveler: Taiwan,"Beyond some nice photography, there's not a whole lot of substance to this guide book. Descriptions are brief and not entirely comprehensive. One positive was the introductory pages that explained the history and culture."
3,Awesome Photos!,"I brought both the Lonely Plant and National Geographic Guide to Taiwan. The Lonely Planet book was great, because the names of places were given in both English and Chinese characters. The Chinese characters are a must for taxi drivers. There are not a lot a pictures, so the National Geographic Guide came in real handy as well. If you are only buying one, the lonely planet guide is esssential."
3,Steel keyboard tray,"I have been searching for a keyboard tray but didn't want to spend $300 plus on a lot of the adjustable one I found. This looked good from what I saw online. It is made out of steel and has some adjustments built into it. The quality of the overall product is ok. I was disappointing with the spin rivets that hold the whole thing together. One or the rivets was not smashed correctly to capture the steel so it did not hold. I was able to fix it myself but I don't think most people will want to ""Fix"" something new out of the box. Mounting it was only ok. It went in very easily but there is a lot of flex in the mounting bracket so getting it lined up takes a little time and really needs a second set of hands to help out. It is wide enough to handle my larger keyboard and trackball mouse which is good. I would recommend this product and I still use it."
3,A fascinating historical artifact,"This is an invaluable read for students of American history who want to understand what the ""Republican Revolution"" of 1992-1998 was all about. Newt is the Tim Leary to Rush Limbaugh's Jerry Rubin."
1,Excellent Sleep Aid,"Have trouble sleeping at night? Don't bother taking an over-the-counter sleep medicine when all you have to do is pop in one of Newt Gingrich's audio book CDs such as this curio from the 1990s and you'll fall asleep within the first five minutes of hearing Newt speak. I found myself doing this many times while going to bed. His promises, such as his laughable Contract With America, are nothing short of hollow; and he has the nerve to want to run for President some twenty years later."
1,More Demagougery from Newt....,"This work, loaded with illogical conclusions and foolish pipedreaming, is proof that anyone in America can publish a book if they're rich enough and have power. While offering nothing to the average reader, Gingrich serves up his usual dose of elitism and embraces tyranny by the rich, if philistine, few."
5,Still great after all these years.,"What a shame this isn't available! E. Power Biggs did a monophonic LP called 'Music of Jubilee' in 1951 that featured excerpts from the Bach cantatas for organ and orchestra, along with some chorale preludes-- a sampler of Bach's church music, only without a choir. Superb instrumentals. After Hi-Fi and stereo became popular, most of these same pieces were redone in stereo in the early 60s, and this CD is a remix and re-release of the second MoJ. The Columbia Masterwork CD version I have includes selections from another EPB album, 'The Six Organ Concerto Sinfonias.' An excellent recording. Wonderful selections. Great performance. Still an excellent sampler of Bach's church music."
5,Simply Amazing!,I forgot a couple ball point pens in my pockets (I know). I did not notice the damage until after everything was dry and coming out of the dryer to be folded. What a mess. I bought this product 10 years ago from Restoration Hardware and did not believe it would work. I could not have been sooo wrong. Everything came out clean after 1 application and rewash. Simply amazing.
2,white khaki pants,"Apparently, the ink stain left in my white khaki pants near the pocket (a pen leak) is not coming out. This product didn't touch the stain, but neither did anything else I've tried so far including DiDi Seven."
4,"lovely literature, terrible title","If you haven't been scared away by the pompous title, this book will satisfy your thirst for beautiful and rewarding literature. These are stories selected by Bloom, inc. according to the ""worthy of rereading"" litmus test, which is, after all, the only real gauge we have for deciding what and what not to read. The stories and poems are primarily drawn from the 19th century, and range from Melville to Lewis Carrol. The selections are arranged thematically by the seasons. The book is handsomely packaged and is a great bed-time reader. Enjoy it on a winter evening among friends, loved ones, and children of all ages. It will rekindle your passion for imaginative literature."
3,Excellent Literature...,"...Lousy editing. I picked up this book to give more depth to my daughter's reading base. Depth it definately adds. There are fantastic pieces in this book! Unfortunately, it seems that no one edited the book. Pieces that would easily fit on one page will start on one and end on the next. Typographical errors are abundant. It is an intellectual dream, but a visual nightmare."
5,The book and the content,"I home school a middle school boy. in great shape, the book is very cool. some of the difficult poems we have had to read together, but over all fantastic! it's both challenging and entertaining."
1,Not recommended,"Many of these stories are far too sinister for small children. Be prepared for tales of dismemberment, divine wrath, ghosts, train wrecks, madness and violent death... and that's just the first two entries in the ""Winter"" section. Skipping around I also found a lovely poem about a Badger being baited, tortured and killed.Maybe my infant child isn't ""extremely intelligent"" after all. He seems to prefer ""Goodnight Moon"" to Mr. Bloom's anthology. I know I do."
3,No pictures,"As wonderful as this book truly is, there are no pictures. I purchased this book to share with my two-year old niece, dreaming of spending many hours in the years to come savoring this masterpiece together; however, I thought there'd be pictures... and there aren't. So, if you are looking for something as remedial as illustrations to go with your poetry and stories, pass on this one."
4,Movie is better but this is still good,Van Helsing the junior novel is very good because of what it was based on. It switches around a couple of the scenes only because it's a junior novel. They took out Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because of that too. The Van Helsing book that isn't a junior novel is better and the movie is the best. I thought it was an excellent story.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS THE CHICKEN DANCE. THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE NOT BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS! IT REMINDS ME OF RETIREMENT HOME, BIG BAND MUSIC"
3,Not much of a story,"I expected more from this book and thought Moose would be a fascinating character. It was an ""okay"" book but I wouldn't recommend. I would have liked more depth to the story."
5,Creative excellence.,"Electronic/dance/trance/ambient/psytrance/... these are just labels. What they've created is (again) uniquely Sphongle.""Nothing Lasts, But Nothing is Lost"" is a syncretic blend of traditional and creative styles. It is the product of nothing short of genius."
4,It means the world to me,"Genre defying band Shpongle makes this album a continuous trip. Touching on various styles (psychedelic, world-music, latin, trance) but never lingering too long in one.People who haven't heard of Shpongle (or classification like ""Goa"" or ""Psychedelic"") will find this album very accessible.For aficionados, this album is a must."
5,Shpongle,"Amazing Sounding Band..... Definite too Any Ones' Serious Music collection....U ought too like Classic UFO/Trippy sounds/Experimental Geniuses...SHPONGLE....Fortunately I seen LIVE in Minneapolis,MN USA Early 2012...."
4,SHPONGLED,"Simon Phosford is one of the best producers of psytrance/tribal beats in todays electronic scene. The music will allure you into a pychodelic world of sounds. There is one producer that even comes close to producing a similar sound as Shpongle. Not to mention, the producer lives in the UK so you better go see a perfermoance in the United States when you get a chance. By the way, Shpongle is going to be at Wakarusa 2011.Shpongle is one of the few producers that incorporates so many sounds into his tracks. The sounds range from chanting, guitars, piano, to full on electronic. I loved this album and hope you get to see him this year at Wakarusa![...]is some information about the festival if you want to see him there!"
4,Awsome tribute to Master of Puppets tour,"I loved it. James, Lars, Kirk and Cliff are more alike than I expected. They have the tall of a playmobil, but, with a lot more articulation. The instruments are really cool, especially the drums with a lot of parts. I loved the stage... It seems the Damage Inc. tour... Check out on youtube some of videos of this tour.You got to be careful to many small pieces that can be lost. Don't abuse of their articulation, it can break easily. Keep it indoors, because the wind can blow pieces away.When I put it in my room, I was amazed how it's beautiful. It's interesting to play and to collect. I recomend this toy for people over 10 years old.Hope you'll enjoy it if you buy it(Sorry for my bad english)...Bye :D"
3,how the macroeconomic had affected to FDI in China,how the macroeconomic have affectedd to FDI in Chin
2,Still hunger,"I am not sure how I came about this book. I believe I requested one book to review and somehow was given this one and another. Considering it was offered to me I felt compelled to read it and write a review.I found Mr. Hall's debut to be quite interesting, but a slow story that never landed. While reading it I kept thinking something is going to happen but it never did. I am not sure what the authors attempt was. Maybe a memoir was not the way to go, possibly fiction?I guess I expected something like this show on HBO called ""Prisoner Cell Block H"" gritty raw and ACTION PACKED. Memoir had no luster it lacked history and reasoning. I hope the authors next attempt ""Smoking Cigarettes"" has a much better story line."
1,Didn't like it,Nothing to say except that I did not like it. I expected more. I thought I would read a lot about how life is for a gay person in prison.
2,"""Just ok""","Memoir was an ok book. To me the author kept going back and forth to much between cells and there was really no prison love there it was all a fantasy. Like i like him and wonder do he know i should show him i do kind of love. When and if you read it you will say to your self all he do is change cells in this book and that there really is no love story behind those bars. That is it. It's ""JUST OK"". I thought it would be similar to ""IN LOVE WITH A THUG"" but is nothing like it. That was a great book. I am currently reading ""Smoking Cigarette's"""
2,Save Your Money,"There are subtle hints about what the producers of a program/DVD think of their product. About 2% of Americans rely on closed captions, and another 8% use them for assistance. It costs between $200 and $800 to caption an hour. Virtually all programs are close-captioned, because a producer can upgrade the experience for that 10% of the audience for very little money. If you respect your product, you do that.The people who produced this piece of crap didn't.This may be the least-competent retelling of a familiar American saga ever done. I give it two stars. That's generous."
3,"Not bad, but I already knew how it ended",I bought this as a christmas present and the person on the receiving end loved it. I am annoyed by Katie (or Kate as Tom calls her) and the series felt way too rushed at the end.
4,RFK & JFK,"My only quibble is that Bob Kennedy would never call the President 'Jack' in a cabinet meeting with others there, it was always 'Mr. President'.Other than that I wish they has shown more of Joe Sr.'s early life (Before becoming ambassador). Barry Pepper & Tom Wilkinson deserve major kudos for their performances."
3,so so,I enjoyed watching the performers on the TV presentation. Brought back many memories. More detail on the Bay of Pigs. Ted Kennedy was noticeably absent from the entire series. The true story of Miss.Kopekne and Chappaquitik (sp) remain untold and the great Ted and his nephews crimes remain hidden from view. It's a shame as this was a story as much a part of the Kennedys as was the series was. So many Americans will continue to suffer from the misrepresentation that Teddy was a white knight of the people.
3,Only two things that bothered me...,"For the most part, this miniseries was pretty good. The acting was great, the scenes flowed well and the drama was great. My only two problems were that they painted LBJ as some ""nice"" guy, which everyone knows he was a totally ego maniac and they didn't get the assassination right. Oswald didn't do it. Period. Aside from those two things, it was a good miniseries."
1,a hatchet job,"The movie presents speculation as fact. I am happy it was finally released on the REELZ channel rather than the history channel which would have given it too much of a ring of history rather than speculative fiction. To be fair, there are historical facts, but there also things presented as fact which have been repudiated by surviving members of the administration who were present at the time of the event."
1,Revisionist history,"This could have been such a great miniseries if the writers had done their research. Doesn't everyone know by now that Oswald was a patsy? ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" have proven that. I'm remembering how Caroline Kennedy said her mother wept for days and days and days and was inconsolable, and the way it was played by Katie Holmes had none of the depth or passion of the real Jackie. I felt the characters were cardboard, and even the good performances were not representative of the real family. Really, painfully disappointing effort by people who had the money to do a great job and settled for shlock."
3,"Entertaining, but milk toast...","Like the others, I can't see what all of the controversy was about as it only hinted at certain things.I thought it would have been at least as absorbing as John Davis's book, written back in the late 80s early 90s.Entertaining, but milk toast...."
4,Worth Watching,"My wife and I had a chance to see this streaming before the Blu Ray release and found it very enjoyable. There has been a lot of commentary before the series was even released related to whether it was accurate etc. There may or may not have been liberties taken but the spirit of the series is to showcase the Kennedys and the force that drove them to become a major political force in modern American politics. I don't feel they were portrayed in a negative light; quite the contrary. From the early election years to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, to finally Kennedy's resolve during the Cuban missile crisis, the series kept us on the edge of our seats."
4,LOVED this series,"I was blown away by this mini-series. (ok, Katie Holmes was AWFUL, but the rest of the cast was out-standing.)"
5,Loved the Kennedys,The movie brought me back to an era of interest. Iam ready to watch it again. There are parts of this film I was never aware of.
5,The Kennedy's,"The miniseries follows the Kennedy family from their days during WWII, JFK's early political career to his Presidency of the United States, with the help of his domineering father Joe Sr. and his devoted brother Bobby. But JFK had many obstacles -- he suffers a bad back, his father made many enemies, and his marriage to Jackie was troubled. Over the course of his administration, JFK grapple with Cuba, the missile crisis with the Soviet Union, riots over civil rights for Blacks, and going after the mob. The series' more salacious aspects: drug habits, mobsters, election fixing by Joe Sr., and JFK's womanizing are revealing until the assassinations that destroyed both Jack and Bobby. The miniseries is a fair and sympathetic look at the Kennedy clan overall and it is a must see for those interested in an overall view of JFK and his Presidency."
4,Great story; crappy discs!,"I love anything about the Kennedy family. This production had great acting, a good script, was a good length. The discs themselves were not that great and did not play in all my DVDs. Also, there are no subtitles, and although I am not hearing-impaired, I like subtitles because I like to get every word, and this is not always possible with the audio.I also don't know why Barry Pepper (Bobby Kennedy) had to wear a protheses nose. To me, the nose made him look less like Bobby Kennedy. I learned this from the one special feature which was included. But all the main characters - John, Joe, Bobby, Rose, and even Jacqueline - I thought the acting was great and very true to the historical figures they were interpreting. This is a great miniseries, and if the discs were produced at a higher quality, and with more features, like subtitles and commentary, like ""real"" DVDs, I would give it 5 stars. As is, I have to dock one star for the poor production!"
3,Very Well Done As Far As It Went,"I missed ""The Kennedys"" when it was on TV had heard it was very good so decided to purchase it. I was not sorry I did the acting was very good brought back things that I had forgotten about."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this book and noticed that it didn't come in a shrink wrap when I received it. I paid little attention because I trust Amazon. But as I was going to ""sign"" it for my grandchild I noticed that there was writing in it. I ordered this ""new"" and paid ""new"" prices for it."
5,Very helpful...,...toward better understanding Christianity's success in a world where Jesus seemed to fail. I love the reasoning behind everything & how the author comes to his conclusions. Highly recommend it.
3,"A homerun? No, a complete miss!","Because the Gospels, contrary to all that is generally accepted, do not give us a report on Jesus Messiah, Son of God, as seems reported by independent eyewitnesses (Mark, Matthew and Luke). They offer us an account of community conflicts, recorded at successive phases of community evolution, (from open quarrels to the healing process) explaining the baffling discrepancies between evangelists. In doing so, the evangelists used a language familiar to the Essene. Jesus Messiah, as were the previous tandem Essene Messiahs, was initially coined as a party label. Both Gospel Messiahs (Jesus and John the Baptist) were there to allow the writers record their dissents and deliberations. Both Gospel Messiahs were just as today the donkey versus the elephant arguing within the same American democracy. Tell me which Messiah you support, and I'll tell you exactly where to position you within the Essene community while turning painfully into a Christian community in Antiochus."
4,Enough to Convict,There is compelling evidence that over 500 individuals saw the man Jesus alive after he was certainly dead. One credible eyewitness is usually enough to turn a verdict one way or the other........highly recommend this book to others.....
3,"Don't worry is not the TV set, is the video","Overall it was a good documentary but with serious technique problems. Hard to understand what Beuys is saying because of his accent, but the audio doesn't help a bit, and it would've been nice to have him in focus all the time also. That really bothered me. About the content, it was interesting, Beuys talks a lot about his work and if you really concentrate and try to understand what he is saying, it is very interesting. I was kind of disappointed because I thought that the video would have some of his performances or collaborations with other artists but it didn't. But as I said on the beginning, overall it was OK."
1,Disappointing,"I expected All episodes of the ""Magic Bag"" Felix. Instead I got a LOT of OLD episodes and very few of the Felix I expected. Disappointing, Indeed. Beware!"
4,Sleep Aid,"I've been using this product for about 4 months now and I am very satisfied with it as a sleep aid. I've had trouble falling and staying asleep all of my life but have no interest in sleep medication, but decided to try this and found that after about a week or so of use, taking one tablet about 30 minutes before bed, I was falling asleep faster and not waking up as much, and if I did wake up I was able to fall right back asleep. I stopped using it for a few weeks and fell right back into my normal sleepless routine, so I'm sticking with it now. The bottle does mention it has benefits to the digestive system, but I cannot say that I've noticed any improvement in that area, so I can't speak to that."
3,still testing,Actually this product is very helpfull at night time. I combine it with LiporidPM and vuala...sleeping like a baby)...
1,"This mic package is very inexpensive, and the sound quality reflects the price",Terrible sounding micsI simply could not get a decent recording from these mics.
4,Buy these mic's,"This microphone package is great due to their low cost, they pick up everything and then some."
2,Disappointed,"This program has much potential. I was very disappointed to learn that even though they stated that it was compatible w/the leapord, it's not. My IBook is Tiger, but the IMac isn't and so I decided to return the program."
1,"You will need another book ""McLaren made easy""","This book is disappointing in the way it was written. too much carelessness in writing. The writer did not organize his thoughts into titles but rather wrote endlessly without subtitles and at many times his thought was not clear at all, which made his writing has nothing to do with ""Made easy"" titleHe added nothing significant that can explain the vague nature of Gann's work.The title is misleading and is not worth the price at all"
5,"A deeper understanding of Freud, the Bible and history","There's a lot to learn from this book; anyone interested in the Bible, religious history, or more specifically the psychology of group memory and/or Sigmund Freud's lesser known research should enjoy it. It also sheds light on the process of Old Testament creation vs. history, and the relationship between Judaism's monotheism with the ancient Egyptian sun-worship revolution that marks ""the absolutely first monotheistic, counter-religious, and exclusivistically intolerant movement of this sort in history."""
4,Exellent,Exellent study of the Moses figure as a symbol in the western memory and scholarship. Serves as a brillant introduction to both Biblical- Egyptian and Psychological studies.
3,Don't believe the marketing hype,"You're not going to get surround-sound quality from this product. That's a pretty outlandish claim, one that Xitel really shouldn't be making, in my opinion, because it creates a false expectation.However, you are going to experience superior sound from your stereo TV or whatever two-speaker device you've connected it to. I'm enjoying richer bass and crisper dialog from my DVDs. And I like that you can easily switch the settings with the handy remote, both to adjust to whatever you're playing as well as to simply compare what it sounds like when the SoundAround is and isn't processing the audio.I also agree with another reviewer here: It's a shame you can't plug more than one device into the SoundAround. I'd love to have both my DVD player and Xbox hooked up, but alas.In short, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this device for $100, but if the price drops to $70, it might be worth considering."
3,Moderate sound improvement,"Improves sound somewhat, including dialog clarity. But not really worth more than $30 or so. By the way, it originally sold for $100. It's selling on the company website now for $70. It never had a list price of $141 as Amazon claims. Typical price inflation by Amazon so they can claim they're giving you a bigger ""discount."""
2,It does stuff to sound!,"It's a straightforward soundgooderizer, fun to play with if you like tinkering with sound or if you simply must get more bass from the speakers you already own.The TRUbass really does add a lot of boom, more than I care to hear..Couldn't help notice the power supply is 12v dc... this thing could probably be installed in a car by someone who's got a little wiring experience."
4,Product is great.,"Unfortunately, I purchased this to plug directly into my LED TV to play DVD sound but found that due to my set configuration, it would not work properly.However, it did work fine after connecting it to the dish receiver and greatly inhanced the sound.I strongly recommend it for it's intended use which appearantly is not intended for my purpose."
4,Makes voices easier to hear on a 2 channel TV,"I would definitely not have bought this product for it's original price, but at $20 it's worth it for sure. It doesn't make your TV sound like it has surround sound, but it certainly does make dialogue in surround sound movies more clear. The only thing I wish it featured were controls on the unit itself... I'm constantly losing my remote and without it, your stuck with whatever settings you have it on."
3,Not surround but still improves the sound quality of my TV,"Well, it is not a surround sound system... You cannot get surround sound from 2 speakers no matter how much magic or science you put into it. It may sound a little ""surroun-ish"" to the lucky people who happen to have the correct room geometry and placement of the TV in the room to achieve a surround like effect from this unit. What you will get is an improvement on the overall tone of the TV's sound. By boosting the mid highs where most of the human speech is, it clears the dialogs and by boosting the lows (bass), it gives a more impressive sound texture. Overall for $10, it is a good investment that helps to improve the sound of your TV. If you want surround, get a true surround system with at least 6 channels..."
1,not on my truck!,"I've recently purchased a new Dodge Ram 1500 and selected these bed rail caps to go on it. When I test fitted them to the truck, the stake holes were huge, nearly twice the size! How hard is to have stake holes line up directly over the pocket? I guess they decided to make the holes so large instead of trying to be precise?I was so disappointed in the quality that I sent them back for a refund, Amazon has a GREAT return policy!"
1,UltraSuck,"I'd give these a zero rating if I could. I thought they would be a good value, but they only have about 25% (or less) the power of a good name brand battery. I tried these in my pager and they only last about a week vs. 4-6 weeks for a good battery. I used them in a label maker and I could only print 4 labels before they died. I'm half way done with a 100 pack and they all have the same short life."
1,The bad reviews don't do these justice.....,Bought some of these at Micro Center. Absolute worst batteries I've ever purchased. More than half were dead out of the box. Not even good for remotes. Had to cycle through batteries in search of two good ones just to get a channel change. In no way is the price worth the stress or the number of batteries that actually worked. Winning combinations usually lasted a week anyway. An 8 pack of Duracell would beat these. Awful experience.
1,Fraud,"There should be some kind of law against selling items this poor in quality. Shame on Amazon for peddling these batteries.These1) Leak - and damage to the electronics far exceed the cost of these batteries.2) Have short life3) High self discharge - so they are no good after a year on the shelf.I hope FTC or some other body takes a good look at this ""stuff"" and penalizes both the seller and the manufacturer."
2,Some batteries DOA,"Based off my purchase, I believe there is a serious issue regarding quality with this product. Some batteries simply didn't work at all and others had very little energy. I regret the purchase and do not plan on buying from again."
1,They leak Acid,"I Bought a 40 pack (10) 4-packs. Of these, (2) 4-pack had leaked acid. I would never trust this brand again."
2,you get what you pay for,If you need batteries for toys or cameras this is not for you at allBuy name brand there is a reason why they cost more. :-)Max
1,Leaks,"The batteries leak and go flat when stored for periods during which other batteries do fine. They're cheaper, but the money saved isn't worth it."
1,You Need a Battery Meter if You Buy This Bundle,"This would be a good value if all the batteries in the bundle held a proper charge. Unfortunately, many of the batteries do not have a sufficient charge to be useful. In the package I bought, about 30 of the 100 had a full charge. The rest were below 50%. Also, a number of the batteries leaked, which is a potential cause of damage. Those batteries that had a full charge and did not leak performed well, but it is too much risk, in my opinion. Fortunately, no device I have received damage from these batteries, but I came close with a wireless keyboard where a couple of batteries leaked. I will not be purchasing another package of this brand again. Oddly enough, though, the AAA Ultralast batteries do not seem to have the leakage problem, but I still have about 3/4 package left. I will be keeping a watchful eye on them too.Update: The AAA batteries are also leaking now. Even in sealed sleeves. I cannot recommend these AA batteries nor the AAA size."
4,Decent battery usage,"These batteries are good for whatever you use batteries for albeit, I find, not as long-lasting as the name brand batteries. That said, for the price, you can't beat it. You get decent cycle time for flash units, decent-lasting time for motor drives, etc. I highly recommend them."
1,Batteries NABC UltraLast AA Alkaline 1.5 Volt,"Not only did these batteries leak, ruining my device, but I have seen better brands on sale for less when you consider shipping.Ken[...]"
1,not worth the price,"I was very disappointed with this booklet when I received it. After paying $35.00 and from the title, I thought this book would be a more in depth discussion. Instead it covers the basics you can pick up in most travel books. Even though it's 100pps, the typeset is large and it is a tiny size, not that of the average book. This is more like an $8.95 priced book."
1,How Dare They!,"How dare these dimwits make Tolkien into a text-book! The Lord of the Rings was created to be read with joy and wonder, not studied in a class-room by bored students who will thereafter associate it with drudgery and compulsion! Making Tolkien a text is a crime against literature, romance and everything he and we love!"
3,Ugh...,"Why did I buy this? Well, truth be told, it was the first (american) manga I ever read. When I was 10-11 years old, I thought I was pretty funny. Now, I find that the humor is somewhat clever, at best. Do i regret reading it all those years ago? No, do I regret BUYING it now? Definitely, never again will I buy an american produced and released manga, again. Yet the question remains, Will I buy the following books in the series? Yes, if only to see how the story ends."
2,Tedious,"This book might be useful to a beginner with no experience who needs step-by-step guidance for even the simplest things, but for anyone else it is tedious at best.The text is needlessly wordy, and the presentation of certain information is regrettable. For example, the properties, methods, and events of each control are listed in a table; but the items are presented in alphabetical order rather than by order of importance or frequency of use. No context is provided about the C# language or the use of Windows in an a production environment.Even a beginner could learn more easily by experimenting and reading the documentation that comes with Visual Studio and the .NET Framework. And there are much better books on the market.I'm sending my copy to the recycle bin."
3,First timer..,"I am a first timer to strap ons, and bought this both to use on my (male) partner (I am a female), and to masturbate with.I could feel the vibration but the bulb that is intended for insertion in the vagina, I could hardly even feel, both when using on him and alone. There was simply not enough g-spot action, and I would not recommend for anyone who feels they are the type of person who needs g-spot AND clitoral stimulation to get anywhere. The ridges were also hard and harsh since I am very, very sensitive ""down there"". I would not recommend this product to a friend, unfortunately.. it's just not for me!I gave it three stars because I took the bullet out and used it alone, which proved effective. So powerful! Also, because it's easy to clean and very easy to disinfect. No odor, nothing."
5,Great,"This was bought as a gift for my friend who already had one. She told me it was the exact same, everything worked just as fine. The texture (silicone) is very nice, it is apparently a real pleasure to use it. Just big enough (not too much), and pleasing boths. It is prefect for free hands not problems."
1,Not Worth it!,"Too short, vibrator is barley noticable, design is flawed for woman to woman action, do not recommend you waste your money."
1,Worst sex toy ever!!!!!!,"This was such a waste of money. My girlfriend and I tried every position imaginable, but the thing just wouldn't stay in. I guess it's just an expensive dildo with a convenient handle. The only reason I gave it a star at all was the good laugh we had during sexy time. So unless you need need to spend $80 to share a laugh, don't waste your money."
3,"High Quality, but not the best in use","very well made, great for role playing but awkward in actual use. Might be good between two women (which is its original intent) but for pegging it doesnt really stay put...might try it with a harness. Rather large too....if this is the slim I would hate to try the stout...not ready for that."
4,Great experience,"I was a little nervous about this type of toy, but our first use was fantastic. The bulbous end is a bit large, but doesn't feel as big as it looks. The mini vibrator is my favorite part, with the toy or by itself, it's a must-have. Overall a great investment. If you're into it, you'll love it."
4,Strapless,Worked well and no straps to deal with. The vibration was just enough to add the right amount of pleasure.
5,She loves it!,"Made of great quality material, easy to clean and does not have that awful smell right out of the box. Vibrator is powerful, and the batteries that come with it last a good while. This takes some getting used to, and it may seem a little cumbersome and clumsy at first. But once used a few times, it becomes almost natural. Tantus products are the best!!"
5,Nice product,"We love it, me and the wife have a very good time using it. The Slim is very easy to clean also."
5,great so far,"I have an AMS Roadster that gave me problems when installing red hat 6.2. I know that the red hat cd I had was good because it worked for my desktop. Knowing that laptops can be a struggle I got this book, one because it already had a good rating, and two, it comes with 4 versions of Linux! I had already tried the cumbersome method of downloading it off the net (just my opinion). I've already got the Caldera up and installed in one hour and all of the author's directions worked like a recipe book! I don't think this is as extensive of a book on linux as is readily available, but it seems to be the best book for the win 32 user that's trying to get up and running."
4,Good for Newbies,"I liked this book. It covers a lot of the Linux basics that many of the others WON'T cover. What I didn't like is a 98 page section on modem compatibility. This info is available on the web and those pages could have been used for something else. On the whole, the book is good for beginners who have no experience with setting up a Linux desktop in KDE or Gnome (bear in mind, this desktop setup is mostly geared to asthetics) and I enjoyed reading it."
1,jesus christ,wow. every single band on this album misses the entire point of the smashing pumpkins. way to go guys.
1,An Insult to the Nation and Humanity!,"This looked cheaper than what some 7th graders could have created! Low budget, bad plot, flat jokes, corny acting, and the list goes on. First, the main characters are grunts working at a greasy spoon, then a second later, they are paid cops. Their uniforms look more like janitors' garb. There's a white character who works at a restaurant and has an Apu-like accent for no reason. The props are beyond cheap. This makes ""Glitter"" look like Oscar material. I really think the sitcom ""The Jeffersons"" was supposed to be revolutionary in having a cast that is half Black and half white; this film tries to have that same goal. This film is terrible beyond words. It makes no sense why it was made. My eyes, brains, and heart were wounded by this pure garbage. Not even a bored kid could enjoy one second of this. I'm disgusted, just downright disgusted, that any one would have played any role in the production of this work. The art muses must be sobbing right now."
3,OK at best,"Got this on a whim based on links/recommendations under some Jolie Holland CD's I was looking at. This is more twangy/country than I prefer, and I would definitely not consider it a logical step for people that enjoy Jolie Holland's music -- not at all comparable artists, IMO. I loved the Holland CD's, but this is going up for sale as used. Fans of modern country music might enjoy this more."
2,Latest purchases,I wanted the one with the deeper indentation and higher sides. This one doesn't work for me at all. Please send me the other one and I will send this one back to you.Thank you.
3,misleading title ....,"The tile might be misleading.-First : the word ""for dummies"" is misleading, as already explained in a previous review. The expected level of biology knowledge is not advanced, but definitely not at dummy level.-Second : the word bioinformatics might also be misleading. Especially for more computer educated people, the word bioinformatics is about algorithms applied to solve biological problems. This book however is not about algorithms, it is just about which tools exists and how to use them. You can find the same information for free on the internet at the particular tools websites.It is like publishing a book with title ""Car mechanics"" en in the book explaining how to drive a car, instead of how the engine works."
3,information on websites dated,"There is a lot of the book related to giving you details of particular sites to go to -- to perform various tasks. And there is details on exactly the screens you will see how you should fill them out. I found a LOT of that information to be dated and incorrect.I found the information about the basic Bioinformatics tasks to be relevant and accurate, but many of the details given were not of much use, due to the reason given above."
4,Helpful,"Book should be treated as a secondary source of knowledge that will help to refresh memory about bioinformatics. Easy written, nice for weekend."
4,A dark beginning to an exceptional science,"Robert Guthrie sheds light on a part of psychology's history many would rather sweep under the rug. He lays out the awful truth about the racist history of psychology, giving ample evidence to the bias which infested the science in its early years. Guthrie chronicles not only the difficulty black psychologists have had getting their work acknowledged and published, but also the incredible struggle they have encountered in being acknowledged as human, let alone equal to their white counterparts. I simultaneously cringed and laughed at the ridiculous beliefs that motivated psychological research of the early part of the 20th century."
4,Even the rat was white,"The book emphasis on African American Psycological and their acomplishments. This book focuses srticlty on testing IQ mesurments as well as diferntuation used in data for African American comunities. The book lacks mentioning of other cultures like for example latinos, native Americans e.t.c. This book is divided into three parts Bibliography of Psychologists , their acomplishments and IQ testing . Guthrie's book is an excellent book to read. I highly recomended for any college level."
1,This is an anti-white book,"Are you white and want to feel guilty about it? If so, this book is for you. Facts are twisted to appear as if there has been a concerted effort to favor white researchers in the field of Psychology.Let's all go on a guilt trip together. Quit living in the past. It's survival of the fittest. Get your act together! There's room for all of us. You just need to work at it. Nothing is going to be handed to you on a silver platter."
4,Good Speaker for a Low Price,"This was put into an 88 Fiero (Countach Replica). The car is very loud, so I was just looking for adequate speakers that fit a 4x10 hole. Not many options for that size these days. These speakers sound good, even with the volume cranked. I use them listening to news (voice) and music (rock). Both sound pretty good. No instructions come with them, but what do really need to know? For the price, I highly recommend them."
3,Descent speaker for money,"Cant complain for the money. These arent infinity speakers or some other expensive high end speakers but for the money (I paid 20.00 dollars for the pair, shipped) I cant complain. These are hooked up only on amplifier from the receiver and they do the job. I dont believe I would hook them up to an external amp with much more power. They were installed in an old s-10 which is my work truck, so to speak."
2,they are crackling already,"4x10 speakers suck, but I'm on a budget and didn't want to buy adapters to fit 6x9s and have them stick out of the headliner in my yukon. They started crackling after about a week. They work fine on some songs, but sound like crap in others."
3,You will receive 2 speakers!,I dont know if i'm the only ding dong that thought i would only receive one speaker.... other wise happy with product.
1,Very overrated.. only buy if it is for a stock radio,"I got these for my rear in my s10 and they are way overrated... they are more like 150hertz or kz or whatever at the minimun.Meaning that these do not create barly any bass. which means that they will distort alot, and only buy them if they are an upgrade for a stock radio or if you are really desperate... i will return these... not worth the money... spend 20$ more to get name brand like kicker or pioneer"
5,buy one!,"It is a very good looking shoes. Light in spite of the wooden soles. Just dont use it often on hard surfaces like, rough concrete floors as it will easily scratch the soles."
2,Misleading discription,"It's a fine book for what it is - a memoir of two individuals lifetime pursuit of lake trout (keeping in mind it's a part-time pursuit).While there is history, biology and technique. It's sparse.Don't go to this book for information. Inspiration perhaps, but not information.It left me feeling misled."
3,Hit Parade CD,My only criticism is that the artists normally associated with the songs are not the ones you hear.
3,A very nice CD,"The polkas on this CD are fabulous; however, the entire CD is not in stereo so when we played it in our car, something was missing. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed the songs.If you have any suggestions for other CD's (but they have to be in stereo) please suggest."
5,One of the best Hindi movie,"This movie is quiet good , songs are really nice unexpectedly.I started seeing this movie without knowing the fact it was Benegal's movie . Most of the timeI fast forward most Bollywood movies to if there is something interesting or may be funny.But this movie was not out and out comedy but very interesting , I was curious to see if the director can continuethe good stuff till the end. Dialogues are simple ,at times satirical and ofcourse witty.In between I heard couple of nice songs combined with very good playback music .Very nice love story. At the end of the movie I was curious to find out more details about the movie and I found it was Benegals movie. The reason I missed it was I have skipped first 2-3 minutes and treated it like other hindi movies.I was so impressed by the movie watched it again.This is how a movie should be made , it sends right message and very powerful one."
5,Brilliant movie!,Absolutely brilliant....has you in splits all the way from the first scene to the last. Heartwarming!
5,It opened my eyes to the consequences of one mistake,"Meet 17 year old Michael. He has everything, a good girlfriend, nice friends, and a grandfather who just gave him a really cool birthday gift: a riffle. But when Michael and his friend decide to shoot off the gun in his backyard, Michael's life will change forever. Swallowing Stones by Joyce McDonald is a realistic-fiction book that follows this young boy throughout his problems and the decisions he has to make because of this one shot.I loved the way the author switches the narrative of the book from Michael to the dead man's daughter. It is a great book for a teenage girl or boy. Swallowing Stones made me realize that even one shot can kill and once you have pulled the trigger, there is no going back.If you liked Martyn Pig or Whirligig you will definitely love Swallowing Stones!"
3,Solid story,"I am not the target audience of this book (12 & up!), but I thought this was a very decent story nonetheless. It does put forth a serious moral dilemma, and portrays very well the common emotions that may surround such a situation. The author was able to describe the little cliques that exist in any high-school-USA in exquisite detail. Another valuable aspect was the relationship between mother and daughter, its moments of tension and deep understanding. Another one was Michael's catharsis, from an opportunistic teenager to adulthood (wish the transition has been less painful), and how he learns to appreciate (and distinguish) true friendship. My least favorite scene was the final one, which was too contrived for my taste. Other than that, this book would make a young person think. And i love the metaphorical title."
4,HIT WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS!,"As a library media specialist in a grade 7-8 school, I read a tremendous amount of young adult fiction. I found this book remarkable for two reasons- 1)it grabs your attention from the very beginning, and 2) it appeals equally to boys and girls. It is very popular in our library."
4,Swallowing Stones-a great book,"The book Swallowing Stones was one of the best books I've ever read. I could not put it down. I never would have read it unless my teacher had not suggested a few books to my class. Swallowing Stones was one of those books that when she read the back cover, I knew that I wanted to read it right away. I then got the book from my teacher and couldn't put it down. I read it in one week because it was so good. It's about a boy who gets a gun from his grandfather. The boy Micheal, throws a party at his house, and he wanted to show the gun off to a few friends. He did but he also shot it. A mile away the bullet hit a man who was fixing the roof of his house. The man was dead. That next week he saw an article in the newspaper about the dead man. He felt guilty for the rest of the summer. There is a lot more that happens, but you have to read the book to find out."
3,a good book with a terrible ending!!!,Swallowing stones was an excellent read of a probably situation with plot twist and turns and doesn't get boring until the last few pages. The book starts with Michael an innocent enough teenage boy that got a new gun for his birthday. He fires the gun in the air and the bullet ends up hitting the father of Jenna Ward which throws her life into turmoil. This but has many redeeming qualities but it falls short in its terrible cliff hanger ending that does not satisfy any questions about the plot while raising more at the same time. But I recommend this book just don't be disappointed with the ending.
4,swallowing stone,i'am writing about swallowing stones because this book was a really good book.the reason why i set her and say it was a good book because it it was a book the most boys like it had action and i donotno what boy or girl that wouldn't like a book with action.it also made me want to keep reading the book ever time i had to take a brake and it is really hard to make me read just one book.so that's why i say it's a good book.
2,it was great until....,"i loved the book, but i absolutely HATED the ending. i cant stand books that have no conclusion whatsoever. up until the ending i would have given the book 5 stars, but i can't believe how the book ended."
4,great book,Swallowing Stones is a wonderful book. It's a book about a kid named Michael who accidentally shoots a man. The guilt he has to live with drives him insane. He killed a man who lived a few blocks away from him. What was he to do? Should he tell the police and get arrested? Should he lie? The suspense will keep you turning pages. Seeing the girl who's father he had shot turns his stomach in knots. Will he tell the truth and swallow the stone or will he lie and and continue to choke on it? You'll have to find out...It's such a great book! It's one of my favorites. You should read it.
2,Disappointingly shallow,"Anyone looking for insight either into convent life or the renewal/upheaval of the 1960s is likely to find little in this volume. Though there is a fair amount of humour, including a chuckle at Maura's naivete (at least, if one is another nun of the era, as I am!), character development is poor, and Maura seems extremely self-centred. No depth whatever - and therefore no insight."
5,wonderful!,"I am a long time fan of Zino and have never been disappointed with any album or CD I have purchased of him performing and this was no exception. I knew I would love his rendition of the 2nd movement of The Kreutzer Sonata because I have always admired his trills--again, I was not disappointed! This and the 1st movement of ""Spring"" are my favorites on the CD! Zino's playing is ALWAYS beautiful and even though he executes the Kreutzer Sonata with appropriate fury and anxiety--it's gorgeous! Milstein's version is divine but Zino's a completely different style of divine..well worth the listen!"
2,Fact and fiction,"I used this book to study for the Security+ exam, and passed. But consider that I have twenty years of computer experience, not a big surprise either. Though the book covers the majority of the exam material, it has some wildly inaccurate and misleading statements that should have been caught by one of the two authors, and certainly noticed by any technical reviewer. I found the actual exam also strayed from the stated fundamentals."
2,Very very dull.,"I'm sorry, but this book is an absolute chore to get through. In fact, this book was so uninteresting that I've abandoned trying to take the Security+ exam altogether."
4,Good study guide but...,Really good book fo your Security+ exams.I recommend this bookas your first study guide for the exams as it explainsthe topics covered in the exams really simple and to thepoint.As a matter of personal opinion i really think thatyou would also supplement with the Syngress(2nd Edition) book also.It gives you more details in some subjects.Overall this two books is gonna cover you for the exams and i give this book a 4/5 rating!
1,Mea Culpa,"I failed to notice that this was a years-outdated text. I was actually looking for the SY0-301 book, not this SY0-101 book. Original publication date is nearly six years ago. While the information contained within isn't completely useless, it's not a terribly useful resource for the current exam."
4,Security+,"Out of four study books I used, this one covers more than any other, but it still is not complete and sometimes up do date."
4,Short but to the point,"This book is short, not a lot of material to study, but it also tends to shove a lot of info into one page, so you find yourself spending a lot of time going back over material and re-reading so that you can actually answer the questions on each practice test, which thankfully, there are plenty of. If not fot the many, and seemingly helpful practice tests, this book would get three stars in my opinion. But it is a very good book if you are on a budget."
4,Review of Boston Inst. of Finance,"This book was a good guide for studying for the Series 6 and 63. The material was direct and straight to the point (not much fluf). The practice tests were very helpful and some of the questions were on the actual NASD exam. I have only taken the Series 63 so far. I passed on my first attempt. I would recommend this book for anyone taking these tests, but you probably should use additional study material as well."
4,Church Drama at My Church,"This church drama was performed at my church and it had a large impact on the audience, some left crying, some left with new comitments to the Lord. Very moving, it wad done with no set, just a couch in the scenes that took place in the house, and the rest black. Very moving. So moving that I bought the script. I encourage others to buy and peform this script"
4,Great RoadTrip music,"This is a CD to take on Roadtrips. From the title track, to the lively _Pascagoula Run_, this CD will have you rocking behind the wheel. The sadder _Changing Channels_ evokes memories of old loves and wrong choices.At least, _That's my Story and I'm sticking to it_."
2,A pretty terrible release,"OK, there are folks out there who say this album has all sorts of deep value. I am not one of those people. If Hot Water was Jimmy's rock album, this was his pop album ... and it's simply bad. The writing is weak, the songs are uninspired. The album is a tough listen. ""Take Another Road"" and ""Pascagoula Run"" are OK, but certainly not Jimmy's best. I'll take ""Lone Palm"" off of Fruitcakes or ""That's What Living Is To Me"" off of Hot Water before I take any of these tracks. And to all those who think this album was so great, I ask you: Why didn't any of these tracks appear live on Feeding Frenzy or Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays? Because there are very few people that liked this album. Hell, it killed Marvin Gardens!"
2,Jimmy must have needed the money!,"O.K., O.K.- Let's face it- airplanes and sailboats are expensive! This is Jimmy's ""I've got to put out some music to make the payment on the Gulfstream"" album. I'm a dedicated parrothead, but even I have to admit that this isn't Buffett's finest hour. If you REALLY love Buffet, have an extra 10 bucks and go in with low expectations, I guess you won't get hurt."
4,Good Disc,"I have known about ""Lizard"" since its release but am only now adding it to the collection. It's not Buffett's best (not that I want to settle that score--too many greats), but I was pleasantly pleased. ""Lunch,""""That's My Story,"" ""Take Another Road,"" ""Pascagoula Run,"" and ""Carnival World"" really make this disc worth a listen. A few other tracks are okay (e.g., ""Changing Channels""). Much of the album seems to have been unjustly overlooked by radio in the late eighties. Few artists deliver song for song like Buffett."
2,Just not that good.,"I've heard better by him. A lot of the songs are, frankly, boring. They might be entertaining lyrically, but at the same time, if the music is bland, why make the effort to write good lyrics? The horns are overpowering on a lot of the songs, a la Phil Collins in some of his latter day releases, not to mention the weak keyboards that seem to infuse too many of the songs. It's just a corny cd for the most part, in my opinion. Listen to Boomerang Love, if you must, and hear the word Boomerang come out of his mouth at least 25 times in the song, particularly in the chorus. But whether you are a parrothead or not, which I am borderline; I love Buffett. This is just flat-out an average cd, not a 5-star by any stretch of the imagination. Don't be misled. Just because an artist has put out brilliant stuff in his past doesn't mean every cd is a great one. Here is a clear example of such."
5,Easy to Follow,"The instructions for the dances are this CD are clearly spoken, an there are many variations taught on basic square dances. Execellent for first-time dancers or people who would like a refresher course."
4,late 80s rock/pop,"colortone's only album, as far as i know. a little rock, mostly pop. middle of the road but enjoyable. 1 look inside ourselves 2 nothing's gonna be all right 3 stand out in the rain 4 hole in my heart 5 'til the end of time 6 street of 1000 dreams 7 mystery of love 8 same old story 9 tell tale sign 10 four letter word. owen cooper, stephen george, clayton scoble and willy tebbetts."
1,BEWARE! Inferior live versions and re-recordings,Don't waste your cash on this one. This cheaply packaged set features latter-day live takes and new recordings that don't hold a candle to the great original versions. Skip this one.
3,Enjoyable,"These are not the original recordings, which was disappointing. However it is an enjoyable album with some unusual versions and familiar artists."
2,"Nice photography, generic content","This book had some beautiful photography but like most of the TFH series of books was somewhat generic in its content. The information could have applied to most any giant breed dog and seemed to be more entertaining than informative. Considering that the author is an actual breeder of Swiss Mountain Dogs, I had hoped for a more balanced overview of the breed."
5,rare breed,"If you are going to own or are thinking of owning this breed, read this book BEFORE doing so. Its very informative, complete, knowledgeable. It will give you all you need to know to make an informed decision on this breed."
2,Overview,"It is a nice introduction to the Swissy with beautiful photos. The book, however, reads like a brochure. It is inappropriately priced in the textbook range, which it is not (not worth more than $30). The book is superficial and could greatly benefit from some more detailed information. That being said, it does cover some general topics nicely."
1,works great for a while BUT..............,"Very disappointed. Thought it was a fantastic investment, the kids loved it on long trips (we only took about 3) and then it happened....The picture went blank! Only sound came out. This is obviously a known problem so beware if you purchase this. Doesnt work for long and thats probably why the warranty is only 90 days. Too bad too because it is well made structurally and sounds great but whats the sense if the picture cant be viewed. They need to correct this known problem free of charge."
3,Native American Folkore: The Fury and the Gore,"I came across a musty paperback of this novel as a young girl, rifling through my mother's things in our garage. On the first page, my mother had scrawled, 'very scarry', misspelling scary and from curiosity alone, I read it. I can't say as an adult and having read other stories that this stands out as anything terribly frightening, but it did leave an imprint on my prepubescent psyche. Set in San Francisco, various people encounter a malicious spirit, Native American in origin, that leads to a wildly fantastic and somewhat anti-climactic struggle involving the Golden Gate bridge. Charnel House remains a great example of a 'quick read' thriller and although it is a bit choppy at bits (if you're not a huge Indian lore fan, you may want to pass on this and browse through Stephen King) but it is a fanciful read and a great introduction to semi historical horror novels."
4,MASTERTON'S FIRST GREAT BOOK,"Charnel House was not Graham Masterton's first novel but it was his first BIG novel and the first that really garnered him some serious attention in the horror genre. The novel itself is about an investigation into a house that has a strange life of its own. The owner, Seymour Wallis thinks his house is breathing. A private Detective, John Hyatt, comes into investigate and finds something quite sinister. What appears at first to be a typical haunted house novel soon becomes something quite original, with a demon staging its own resurrection in a horrific way. To say much more would spoil too much of the plot. It's been well over 20 years since I first read this book but I still think it's one of his best."
3,Too Much Sherlock Holmes,"The book could have been shorter and less expensive if the authors hadn't decided to put Sherlock Holmes movies in the collection. I'm not sure would Holmes has to do with Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, etc. I'd rather see a book that has horror movies of the era (whether Universal, Columbia, etc.). This book ran too long, and it is not strictly horror movies."
5,Excellent Updating of a Great Book,"Universal Horrors, which was originally published in 1990, is an excellent reference book of every horror related films made by Universal from 1931 to 1946. That book was a real eye awakener for horror movie fans and had a huge impact on how film books would since be written.The second edition of Universal Horrors, published 17 years after the first edition, is essentially an updating and rewriting of the earlier version. It has additional quotes from the performers and production folks. Also, there are many new pictures added to the book. It goes to show that what was perfect can still be improved upon!This book is highly recommended for anyone with interest in the old horror films from Hollywood's golden years. Those who already have the 1990 version should really consider going for this new updated version."
3,alot of the same afghans as other books,"i was given this book and i found that many of the patterns were repeats from other books that i have. i dont feel that the book is organized well and some of the patterns are worded as well as they could be and i had to pull it out and start over and improvise a bit to make it look correct.interesting one that has pine tree and raindeer boarder, one with vines, one with hot air balloons and an awesome noah's ark one i havent tried yet.a few require sewing with yarn.and there are ALOT OF UGLY ONES and some of the colors they picked for the ugly ones are rediculous color combos."
2,White lights are actually light blue,The lights work well but I wanted white or clear lights at these are listed. When I put them on the outside the lights are defintitely light blue. Very disappointing.
3,I would use these outside,"Outside from a distance they look nice.I would not use them inside, the light spectrum seems a bit too cold and harsh.I have also bought red leds like this, same perception.I am starting to think LED lights are not good inside lights."
3,Another series for Nevada Barr Fans,"While not as well written as the Anna Pigeon series, Rachel Porter more than makes up for it with her bizarre friends. Her landlord the gay ex-wrestler, gourmet cook Vinnie, her transvestite doggie yamulke designing friend are only two of a cast of way out characters. In this novel Rachel stumbles onto an illegal paddlefish roe business, run by an overweight Russian mafiosi who thinks he's Elvis. But this is only a side line for him, his real business is the white slave trade.This is an entertaining and highly unrealistic novel. Good for an escape and alot of fun."
5,Speart at her best!,"I have read all of Jessica Speart's Rachel Porter series and have to say each one is better than the last - if that's possible! I love all of the characters: Rachel; her boss, Charlie; her friend, Terri. Speart's writing is very descriptive and I find myself totally immersed into the story, as if I were a spirit on Rachel's shoulders, experiencing each moment with her. I tend to be a ""cozy"" mystery person, but Speart's books are one of the few exceptions I make. ""Black Delta Night"" was an absolutely fantastic book delving into the black market caviar industry. It's a must-read for anyone who enjoys good mysteries."
3,Present life is not Hell?,"Lynn Schuldt's, ""A Prophecy Paradox,"" is intriguing yet not all together convincing. The idea that our Lord Jesus Christ has already returned (for the second time) is not only preposterous, but bordering heretical. I read Lynn's book, not from within a popularistic future view, but with the background and insights that the Holy Spirit has given me from my readings of the Bible; all which point to the future coming of our Lord and Savior. If one truly desires to study the second coming of Christ, I suggest they read the Bible, and not the heretical, ""Prophecy Paradox!"""
4,A Good Beginner's Book,"This book and Todd Lofton's ""Getting Started in Futures"" are probably the best beginner's books in the market. These 2 books give you a feel for the futures game, to let you decide whether you should participate in it or not. This book touches most aspects of trading, but you should study a thicker deeper hard cover book by Jack Schwager, Perry Kaufman, Martin Pring or John Murphy before committing serious money to the game."
4,Good continuation of the series,"I didn't start watching this show till the fourth season, but I was able to catch all the reruns on the Lifetime Channel. I absolutely love this show! While I can't say that the second season was quite as good as the first, it did have its share of ups and downs and AWESOME plot twists. A definite solid follow-up to season one!"
4,thrilling,loved this season. always keeps me on the edge of my seat. cant wait for season three to come out onto dvd.
5,Excellent,"The five girls are back with a blast. I really enjoyed this second season. Lynne is my favourite character. She is so smart, she finds a solution to everything. Can't wait for the third instalment."
5,Juicy-life on Wisteria Lane,"The second sesion of Desperate Housewives is almost as interesting as the first.The Second Season goes more into the lives of those interesting Desperate Housewives:Gabby: lost her baby and with husband Carlos tries to adopt or do suragacy.Bree: just lost husband Rex while trying to deal with gay son Andrew, guy chasing daughter Danielle, obsessive paramore George as well as hiding her alcoholism.Susan: has her hands full with daughter Julie and her on again off again relationship with Mike. Added to that the marriage to her ex so she can have an operation while he is dating Edie.Lynet: goes back to work and faces many crisis while trying to prove that she can be a career woman and mom at the same time.Edie: involved with Susans ex Karl.While they are dealing with all this they are also curious about the new people in the neighborhood the Applewhites who have secrets that they don't want to get out.Very funny and interesting show and great acting!"
5,Desperate for some more fun with those great gals!,Desperate Housewives is a wonderful show. What more can I say?
1,Desperate Housewives Season 1 Review,"I received the requested DVDs in 1 week, which was great. But they were advertised as being in very good condition and they weren't. The first DVD of the set had 2 areas that I could not play through. I had to skip over them, never knowing what I missed! I haven't made it through the rest of the set to know if there are additional problems."
1,Desperate House wives has jumped the shark,This season was the worst season so far of the show. What a waste with the guy in the basement totally stupid. Not worth it!
5,"anonymous from new york, ny",The series are very entertaining and when I had TV I was watching them regularly. Now my TV set is not working and it is a good possibility to watch all of the series I have missed. I would also reccomend the DVD for fans of the tv series who have a busy schedule.
4,Current Prime Time Trash with a Kick,"Acting, direction, dialogue and situations are enough to satisfy any prime time soap opera addict or enthusist. Several story lines going on at the same time without causing confusion. Bed and heart hopping are constant in this romp through Wisteria Street. Backstabbing, lying, rumors, lawlessness, controlling, and sex all seasoned with evil and vindictiveness."
5,Great set,Season 2 was every bit as good as the first Season. Great behind the scenes footage and outtakes....can't wait for Season 3 to come out.
4,Desparate Housewives - Complete Season Two,"We've watched about half of the package and find it to be very entertaining. We had just completed Season One and were anxious to continue on to the next season. When we finish Season Two, I'm sure we'll continue on with Season.We found this series to have a good storyline, is extremely funny or humorous, with extremely interesting and attractive characters.The DVDs are of excellent quality and are shipped and received expediently and as promised."
3,A little disappointed,"All the DVDs played okay however at the beginning of each episode the subtitle were defaulted to ""on"" and it was annoying to go back each time to turn them off."
3,I think the first season is much better than this season,I think the first season is much better than this season. I don't like this season.
4,Entertaining!,My husband and I are addicted to this show!It was difficult to stop watching after just one episode.He went away on business and made me promise to wait for him before watching another episode.SHH! Don't tell his friends!We can't wait to buy Season 3!
5,Very nice shoe tree,"This looks identical to trees that I purchased at Men's Wearhouse a few years ago, absent the little plates. It stands apart because it has that good, strong cedar aroma. I don't like cedar to overpower my skivvies, but it's very useful on my shoes.The tree's design stretches the bridge of the shoe (the wide part) and stretches the heel, so the shoe is easier to don. The price is reasonable, and it arrived in a sturdy cardboard box suitable for gift wrapping if desired (that was packed into an Amazon box). These are a must-have for any man with a wide foot who owns dress shoes."
4,Quality cedar shoe trees!,These are top-notch shoe trees. Fit like a glove and keeps your shoes looking like new. Easy in and out. They smell good too! I bought three pairs and glad I did.
4,Great Shoe Tree!,"The problem with a decent shoe tree is tracking it down at a reasonable price. Woodlore has solved this problem with their adjustable cedar shoe tree.My largest point of apprehension with regard to purchasing a shoe tree online was ensuring that the size was right. In this case I referred to the size chart included as an image on this product page, and the tree fit like a glove.While the tree is adjustable, it adjusts automatically. That is, the tree cannot be manually adjusted. Depending on the accuracy of the size chosen, and the shoes into which the trees are being placed, this will probably not create an issue. However, I would recommend a manually adjustable tree for shoes that are more supple or malleable. These trees are perfect for a solid cap toe.The Woodlore adjustable cedar shoe tree is aromatic, appropriately absorbent, well fitting, and priced to sell."
2,Ok but cheap construction!,This shoe stretcher is decent but not very well made. I use it to keep my leather shoes from losing their shape when I'm not wearing them. I've seen better ones out there for less money.
3,needs better finish,These trees have a rough finish and make it difficult to put them into the shoes.
4,Helps preserve my shoes,"Great Shoe Tree, helps preserve my shoes and keeps them from getting creases. I used these for size 10 shoes and they fit perfectly"
4,as shown,The product is very sturdy and smells very nice. Just be aware that these will not fit all shoe types the same. They do not fit my high end sneakers (yes they exist --Vuitton) very well but they fit loafers and dress shoes very well. I have three sets of these cedar trees.
5,All good,Does what it's supposed to. Light enough to travel with. Nice smell is stronger than my gross smelling feet. Has the ironic effect of making your shoes look classier when they're not on your feet.
4,They're Great,"I liked the first pair so much that I purchased a second pair.They really help to keep the shoes ""formed"" when you are not wearing them."
5,Excellent Product for the price,Service was good and these are certainly a good value. I would definitely recommend the product and service was excellent.
5,Well worth the price,"I bought these for my new oxfords and I'm glad I did. They're nice for traveling because if you have to throw your shoes in a bag you don't have to worry about crushing them or putting odd creases in the leather. I was sold with just this attribute, but they also smell great. I can't really comment on their deodorizing power since my shoes are fairly new. But they're worth it. Follow the sizing chart on the woodlore website."
5,Keeps shoes in great shape,These shoe trees (an order comes with 2) fit my shoes very well. I have wide feet and these stretch to fit my leather shoes. These keep my shoes looking great and the cedar smell is great as well!
5,Fits perfectly,"I have only had these for about a week, but from what I can tell, they work perfectly...a recommended buy."
2,Works great but breaks easily,"I purchased two pair of these shoe trees about a month ago. On the plus side, they are made from a pleasant looking and smelling cedar that will absorb moisture and odor. They are also easy to put in shoes and adjust to the general shape of the shoes. The one down side I've found thus far is that one of my shoe trees split completely on the handle, rendering the tree useless. This happened after less than a month of use. It may be a better idea to look at a higher quality product. Spending less for a product that breaks quickly is not money well spent. On the plus side, one pair of my trees is still usable."
5,Shoe Trees,Great shoe trees - keeps your shoes in shape and helps with odor because of the cedar! Would recommend to anyone looking to prolong life of shoes.
4,The Woodlore Adjustable Shoe Tree Does great.,This Woodlore Adjustable Shoe Tree works just as good as the first one I bought. It can be a little difficult to remove and install.
2,Olive Oil is better,"this stuff smells nice but it made my skin scaly. Im switching back to extra virgin olive oil, works better as a wax remover & is much cheaper"
4,It works for me!,"This book worked for me. I must say it is perfect for renters who don't know where to begin with a decorating project. Myself being one of those people, I was able to read through the book quickly (which I am thankful for...who needs another college book to read)and impliment the suggestions. Since the book was short and to the point, I actually took the time to DO what it said. Even though this book lacked colorful pictures ( it refers you to their Rental Decorating Digest website), I felt the instructions where far more than enough to guide me through my decorating project.My practical application: I drew a floor plan, arranged my furniture, added modern style, matched colors (using a pillow) & chose window treatments...the best part, I didn't spend a fortune. That alone is a thumbs up for me.Readability : Quick & EasyUsability: Straight forward & do-able"
2,Lacks organization,"While the author has tons of documentation about panics and bear markets, he fails to draw conculsions and suggestions together. Advice is scattered hither and yon. It looks like a collection of short pieces stuck together. It would have been much more useful to summarize the findings and organize the evidence behind it. This book doesn't know if it is history or ""how to"" book. However, it is the best (maybe only) summary of past panics and bear markets so it is good to have in an investor's library."
5,Fabulous recording,"I love this recording. The Tchaikovsky is fabulous and the Shostakovich is one of my favorite recordings of the piece. She does not have an angular sound to her playing (typical of the ""Soviet"" sound), but rather maintains a consistently sweet sound while remaining introspective, which I prefer. I think her pacing is wonderful and is fully backed by Abbado - as an example I think the transition into the final movement (Burlesque) is perfect. I find most recordings to have a pause or are just too slow in general.I felt this recording deserved another review, since the other reviewer obviously has very specific ideas of what the Shostakovich should sound like, but did not offer other recordings as options. The premiere recording with Oistrakh is available and other recordings I have liked were with Catherine Manoukian and Viktoria Mullova."
2,A fiasco in Shostakovich,"While Tchaikovsky is beautifully played with the grandiose back up by Berliners under Abbado, Midori clearly fails to grip Shostakovich's modernity. She plays as if this masterpiece were of character of a late romantic, and this fatal mistake makes the whole performance a fiasco-like failure. It is sad to think we have failed to enjoy a rare opportunity to hear Abbado's Shostakovich."
5,Great Book!,"Bust out your highlighter, ladies! This book is filled with great advise and tid-bits on how to make your life ooze fabulosity. But, it's not one of those dry self-help books - I mean, it's written by Kimora Lee Simmons!! If you've ever seen an interview with her, that's exactly how her book is written - with great insight and humor. She talks about her childhood and modeling days, as well as what she's learned from running Baby Phat. The book covers Kimora's views and advise on Confidence, Work, Independence, Body Image, Romance, and Positivity. My favorite part is the collection of quotes at the end of each chapter from everyone from Lil' Kim to Maya Angelou."
1,Flopulosity,didnt like it all... Kimora is just a loud mouth who wrote a book... no practical tips at all unless you want to be a model!
2,Blah Blah,"Dont get me wrong I LOVE KIMORA !! And she is fabulous. But this book.....as much as she says this isnt about telling her life story, it came off to be that way. It was an encouraging book but after a while they all say the same thing. I read half and just couldnt take anymore."
5,"Not loud, but just perfect.","I did not need much, just a little something more than stock. It makes a noticeable difference. Of course, the best buy gu couldn't notice a difference (his ears were moat likely ruined) but it is just what I needed."
1,Don't recommend,"This thing was perfect in my Jeep. Sounds AWESOME while it worked. Had it in the Jeep for over a year, and like so many others, the amp blew. This makes the thing useless. You have to get the amp replaced (~$90 at a certified repair place) or bypass the internal amp with a different amp. Like I said sounded great when it worked. I have a Wrangler, so no trunk to penetrate, therefore I barely had it turned up ever. It was always set real low, and had a ton of bass.For a throw away component, it is way overpriced."
2,Too big and bulky,"This item was listed under the search for under seat powered subwoofers. Subwoofer is made to stand up on it's side, not lie on it's back under the seat. This would not fit under any seat in any vehicle. It looks nice and may sound great, but if you're looking for a compact subwoofer to fit under a seat or in any tight area this is not the one for you. I had to send it back and get my money refunded MINUS the shipping charges."
2,"Great Design, sounded great for 5 minutes","I spent days researching the reviews on this item and i was a little skeptical about ordering one. I figured maybe I will get lucky and get a good one. I got the wiring all hooked up correctly and the sub in place, I fired it up and it sounded awesome, hit hard and I was very impressed. I got all the settings down and I was very happy with it. About 5 minutes into breaking it in the sound just went away. I turned it off and tried it again and once it was turned on again it had nothing. I was very disappointed, but at the same time I realized that all the other bad reviews were correct. I am happy with the design and the way it fit in my truck, but the whole system with the amp needs to be revamped. If you are thinking about buying one of these, I would look somewhere else. Infinity makes great products and I will still buy them, but not this one again."
2,Buyers Be Ware,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this subwoofer over 12 months ago. The subwoofer sounded good for my listening purposes of old school R&B.; However, many reviewers complained about the service life of this speaker. Now I know exactly what they meant. I only used this mainly for trips back and forth to work with trips averaging less than 30 minutes each way and a few hours on the weekends. Being in my 60s I did not over extend the bass or volume, but like the prior reviewers reports, IT JUST STOPPED WORKIN.To all future potential buyers, take into consideration that the cost of this subwoofer is rather inexpensive, but to have it installed correctly that labor cost is going to add-up. Save your money and buy another subwoofer other than this Infinity Basslink 200, if you do expect to dish out more money when it fails."
1,Do not buy from this company!,"*update* I contacted Infinity to get my sub fixed and find out I do not have a warranty with this product because this company is NOT an authorized dealer. I have gotten no assistance from this company about the matter. Now I have a busted sub and have to purchase another one.PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!///////////////////////////////////////////////Very low woofer durability!I purchased this item less than a year ago and about three months after I installed it in my truck, the woofer blew and now it sounds horrible. I'm trying to contact the seller for warranty info, but am having a hard time hearing back. I'm very dissatisfied so far."
3,"Loud, but not crisp","The short version of this story is that this speaker takes up less room than most self-powered subs, but it's not as accurate as some of them. You can crank it up to nearly the point of pain. But if you're looking for crisp lows during quickly-moving tones, look elsewhere. The best way I can describe it is ""muddy"". Yes, you'll hear the music, but you won't hear defining tones if they're moving quickly. Take a good Bass 305 sub test, for example. My experience with SAS Bazooka tubes (10"", 200W or 250W) has been much better. If you can spare the space for those, I recommend them over this Basslink."
2,Steer clear.,"I have owned 2 of these units. I liked the ease of the install, and the sound quality is generally good. They are a little boomie for my taste (I prefer a tighter bass), but overall happy with the unit.Right up until the first unit went up (literally) in smoke. Odd, since the stereo was at low power and on CNBC, but hey, things happen. So I tracked down a replacement unit, popped it in and good to go. For about a year, then it stopped working too.So my assessment is to stay away, there are better choices out there. These are low quality units."
3,"IIt's ok, but not the greatest","I bought this to add some sound to my Avalanche. It sounds good until you turn it up, then it falls on its face."
2,Not very loud.,"If you are trying to get just a little bit more bass than your factory speakers are giving you, this is the product for you. If you want to be able to feel the beats, or even expect it to vibrate your rear view mirror at all.. it is not the product for you. The other reviews stating how loud it is and how amazing it sounds... I don't think they have ever had a real setup before. This was very disappointing, it is being moved to one of the kids cars, and we are buying another (real) setup for our car."
3,ok,this sounds pretty good has decent amount of bass but not enough to satisfy me.would be good for someone wanting to add some lows but not for people who are use to having decent systems.
4,buy it good deal,Good item I give 4 star's it's dependable loud for it's size and simple to use my friend's like it a lot !
