3,"Blehh, so healthy","I just got this stuff, and man does the tatse resemble dog food. I definately reccomend blending with fruit and juice of some sort. I can really feel the health effects though, and it really does curb your appetite."
4,Ultimate Meal,I am very happy with this product. I carry some with me as a quick meal and it gives me the boost I need mid day.
5,This isn't bad folks!,"Hey all of you talking about the taste, here's how I compare. If you've ever had Super Food Greens, then this tastes just like it. I'm a big wimp, and as unhealthy as this may seem, I put two scoops of this stuff in with orange juice. Yes, may not be the healthiest, but at least I'm still getting all the vitamins without having to pull out the blender and blend stuff! If I drank a glass of orange juice everyday, it be the same thing, so why not mix in the ultimate meal. That's how I've gotten around the Super Food Greens taste for years. Cheating, yes....but am I really? You decide."
4,Taste....,Ok..This stuff does not taste good. People's descriptions of retching and such...It's not that bad in my opinion. If you've eaten something other than a cheeseburger in the past ten years you should be ok. Just add more that the recommend apple and banana. Definitely needs some berries (I don't know if blueberries will do the trick. Maybe strawberries). Anyway it takes getting use to but you are full when you are done. Experiment a little and hang in there.
5,Superb product,This would be great for weight loss. The makers have a reputation for delivering high quality.
1,Hypnosis would not be enough to control the gag reflex,"If you want to have a good idea of what living in what is otherwise called the bad afterlife must be like, try some of this ""stuff"" and imagine it as your daily food entitlement. It is disgusting. I stayed with it for many, many days until my stomach actually started rebelling with cramps, and then I knew it was not just my taste buds. Hypnosis would not be enough to control the gag reflex."
3,Just can't stand the taste,"I am sure this stuff is healthy which is why I gave it 3 stars, but the taste is absolutely horrible. I drink and enjoy green smoothies, so its not like I am not used to drinking green based foods in liquid form. However, this stuff is absolutely nasty tasting to the point of making you gag. I made the mistake of buying the large container figuring the bad reviews on taste were just by people not use to greens in liquid form. So if you are thinking of buying this, you SHOULD BUY THE SMALL CONTAINER to make sure you can stomach it. Or, better yet go in on a large container with a few friends--chances are one of them will not be bothered by the taste and the others can get reimbursed and let the friend who likes it keep the stuff--that way none of you will be out any money. I will be giving this stuff away--more than happy to waste the $50 and save many ""gag"" reflexes."
5,I Swear by this stuff!,I've seen alot of the reviews saying how horrible this stuff tastes. I don't really get it. I will say it looks pretty bad colorwise and the consistency when made with an apple and banana may not sit well with some folks (its kind of like drinking slightly watery applesauce). But the taste is actually very good and it contains just about everything you would want as far as nutrient content. It keeps my full for a couple of hours. I have a glass every morning and I really have felt a difference. Give it a go!
5,Feeling good!,"I just received this stuff a few days ago and I love it! The taste wasn't as bad as others were saying in their reviews, I thought it was delicious combined with half a banana, frozen blueberries, a little agave, flax seed oil, and unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I am trying to lose weight and I have this for breakfast with a half a grapefruit and then for lunch with either sushi, or a salad and I am hoping along with exercise, this will do the trick. I am really glad I bought this though, well worth the money!"
5,Best Meal Replacement,"This has been a really easy way to change my diet. I've been trying to switch to a more vegetarian/raw food diet.Concerning taste, a big difference is made by using only organic bananas and unwaxed apples (which is what the company recommends). The organic fruit seems to mix better and makes the drink much smoother. The drink itself is actually tastes pretty good. It's sweetened with stevia and spirulina has a naturally sweet taste.Although 17 grams of protein per serving (same as an odwalla protein bar) is pretty good, I still wish there was more. It comes out to about $1.88 per serving, which isn't too bad."
3,No Doubt It Is An Incredibly Healthy Food Product....,"...but, when I think of an ""Ultimate Meal"", I think of a healthy, great tasting experience. Far from it with this product.After researching this and other similar products, I concluded that The Ultimate Meal is everything it claims to be...incredibly good for you. But after two weeks, I still (literally) gag when trying to drink this stuff. I started by mixing my organic fruits with it, even adding some OJ like one poster suggested (even though the label says not to). I moved on to sweeter yogurts to try and cut the terribly taste, but to no avail.If you can get past the stinging rotten pea soup odor and flavor and it doesn't bother you, I would recommend you buy this product. Otherwise, stick to the traditional vegetarian/vegan diet."
1,BE CAREFUL! MY CAN CONTAINED MEAL WORMS! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!,"I am absolutely disgusted!! I ordered this through Amazon from The Vitamin Shoppe and when I opened the can you could clearly see little worms all through the powder. Meal worms! As far as I know the product is not expired. There's no expiration date on the can. But it says that it has a shelf life of 3 years. I have been using The Ultimate Meal for over 2 months now and I have been buying it from my local health food store, until I found it here on Amazon cheaper. I have contacted the Ultimate Life company, but I have not heard back from them as of yet. And I have asked for a full refund from the seller. I love The Ultimate Meal. It is a wonderful product, but what I received was totally disgusting. If you have bought from this seller, make sure you CHECK YOUR CAN CAREFULLY."
1,WORMS IN THIS PRODUCT From The Vitamin Shoppe,I purchased this product once before and found this to be a great product. I purchased this again in AUg of 2011 and in Oct/Nov found worms in this product after eating half the can. I was sick to my stomach about this and wrote about this to the store. they never got back to me until jan 2012. They said they could do nothing about this .I sent an email to them as the asked giving them the lot number and heard nothing from them till Jan. THey are not to be trusted and i will never buy from the The Vitamin Shoppe again. Please be careful for they sidestep the issue and balm AMAZON.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013YYR6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,Tough to take down,"Follow the recommendation and add fruit to your shake, because even though I can consume just about anything without yakking, this is pretty gross. It's supposedly packed with all the goodness you'll need, but I'd rather stick with smoothies and juicing, than pay to choke this down again. It's like green garbage going down. Not so much the taste, just the consistency. But trust me, you'll want to add an apple and banana to make it the least bit palatable."
4,"great book, but..","this is a great pocket book for 1st year radiology residents. but there are no specific measurements (like general obstetric) or age related measurements for liver, spleen and kidneys that we encounter everyday and also transrectal and transvaginal images are not included.but again, i still recommend this book."
3,A good book for US beginners,"Color Atlas of Ultrasound Anatomy is a good book, when starting to do abdominal ultrasound scans. However it soon becomes quite useless, when you get some experience. But after that it can still be used for checking the normal dimensions of anatomical structures. I was disappointed that the book doesn't really help you locate the bile duct, even though that is one of the big challenges to me. Overall a good guide to ultrasoud anatomy."
1,Incorrect cover,"For some strange reason Amazon continues to advertise the Anthony Braxton Willisau concert cover, but in fact, if you purchase this you will receive Tribal Gathering. I have already purchased and returned the double CD. I'm not sure what genre of music Tribal is but it is not jazz! Be fore warned!"
4,Good food for thought,This is an interesting look at some of the issues faced by those who were involved in the Rwanda massacre. It shows us not only what is possible but what is necessary for our lives to be complete.
2,Titanic deserves better than this,"Thankfully, I managed to buy this in a set, along with the other 4 DVDs, but if the other DVDs are anything like this, it'll be on sale pretty fast. It was only 55 minutes long, but I gave up half way through. It got interesting when we saw some of the actual survivors of the Titanic - including one lady who was conceived on the Titanic. What a claim to fame. But the sound was badly transferred over from video to DVD, and no matter how much it's turned up, it's not good, and barely audible. The Titanic deserves to be remembered in better ways than this, a by-numbers DVD. I hope the rest are better."
3,Inflation is not easy on these,"The only real issue I have with these is they are very hard to inflate and you have to be very careful when pushing in the needle to do so. I actually pressed to hard on one and pierced the topside plastic, ruining it. I had to use a light duty electric to get the inflation I desired. The hand pump would have taken an hour probably. I ordered a 3rd disc as a replacement for the one I ruined, and the valve leaked when trying to inflate. It got to a certain partial inflation and would just leak out as you pumped. I checked with soapy suds for leaks, it was just the value and only when pushing air i. I returned it. I purchased an SPRI disc at Sports Authority to replace and it inflated very easily. I will use the ExerTools Dyna Disc I have and it is functional, but I would not purchase another one."
2,Dyna disc did not work for me,"I was at a quilt class and several women were using them to sit on to help their backs. I ordered one with trying ""it on"". It could be wider or bigger so it would be easier to sit upon. But I do use it as a cushion between my back and the chair. Would I order it if I tried it first? No. Also, this product was much less expensive to order thru Amazon than the company directly. But the shipping was quite expensive $8 or 9. I mean this thing weighs less than a pound."
4,Film currently being serialised on the net,"The film of Snuf de Hond in Oorlogstijd is currently being serialised on the Evangelische Omroep, and episodes can be viewed at http://uitzendinggemist.nl and http://www.eo.nl/snufdehond"
5,You need this dvd.,"Reunions suck. Always. They are usually for nostalgia only. Fun, but not essential. This is the exception. Iggy is loud, wild, aggressive, and the Ashetons (along with Mike Watt) groove like it's 1969 all over again. This performance is not just a novel reunion, it is top notch. It's no coincidence this show was rated as one of the best concerts of 2003. I've read the complaints about how this dvd was filmed. Well, I suppose if you like fast edits, effects, and an abundance of crowd shots, this video is not for you. It does not look like mtv. At the same time, the quality of the footage is high. The cameras roll, the band plays, and you get to see how it actually went down. Generous bonus footage as well."
4,Just Like Being There,"I was at this show, and the DVD put me right back there on the lawn. On the lawn being the key point. The camera must have been only a few yards away. There was nothing fancy about this show. No spotlight. Barely any lights--except when the house lights were called for. Iggy spent half the night in the shadows and amongst the folks.The one big thing missing from this DVD is getting more footage of Iggy's one-of-a-kind dancing. I was also hoping to catch a glimpse of Sonic Youth and the Von Bondies (although you do see Marci Bolan at the end of the stage clearing), or some other back-stage antics--but then again, this is Iggy And The Stooges Live In Detroit.This DVD is more than a captured live performance. This is a frozen moment in time. Originally scheduled on the day of ""The Blackout of 2003,"" this performance reminds me of those very strange days. Essential for anyone that was there--interesting for those who weren't."
4,Stooges Reunion: Very Cool,"I was at this concert! In addition to the Stooges reunion, the concert featured local band Von Bondies, and one of the top bands in punk rock history, Sonic Youth.This DVD is a great reminder of a special night with Iggy back in Stooge form, joined by Mike Watt on bass."
4,"Pretty good for 50 year olds, but they are 50","Speaking as someone who thinks Funhouse is the greatest rock album of all time, I can say this DVD is pretty good. The performance is good, but surely lacks the drive they had 35 years ago. The main sonic pleasure is the color of Asheton's guitar and the clarity with which you can follow his still fantastic playing. Visually, you get to see Iggy make all his classic moves. Ron A. is pretty stationary, and Watt is unobtrusive (and plays fine too), and Scott A. is hardly on camera, and is probably has lost the most chops, sounding a tad generic. The sound quality is excellent, clear, full, and smooth, though a bit too clean and sterile. Guitar is up in the mix, which is good, since that's the highlight of the disc. Camera work and editing aren't too good at following Iggy and don't give enough long looks at the fretwork. And though I'm glad I saw this, I'm not sure if I'll ever need to watch it again."
4,"Great gun, old model","The Model 98 is a GREAT DURABLE GUN. Definitly the best gun u can get for $100. But before buying it, you should read about the newer model: the 98 costum.Its practically the same thing, but with more trigger ubgrades. (Ex: an E-grip)i have used it several times in speedball, but since it lacks a double trigger, it isnt great for it.If you really like speedball, i'd suggest getting a Smart part's ION. ($200)All in all, this is the perfect starter gun."
3,It's the old version,"The Model 98 displayed is the old version. It's not even the Model 98 custom so don't plan on being able to upgrade this model.In it's day, it was a very nice marker but for a little more you can get something much better like the 'Tippmann Custom Pro', 'Tippmann A5' or even the 'Model 98 Custom'. All these will give you more options to upgrade your marker."
5,U HAV 2 BUY THIS GUN!!,EVEN THOUGH ITS THE OLD 1 ITS STILL AWESOME!!! IVE EVEN BEATEN AUTOCOCKERS WITH THIS GUN!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!BUY IT!BUY IT!BUY IT!
4,One of the Better Hiatt Discs,"I would rate this one comparable to his last release and stronger than Little Head. To give you perspective, my favorite Hiatt discs thus far have been Walk On and Crossing Muddy Waters.The disc has enough variety to keep Hiatt fans interested, though the only advertised cut on the front of the packaging is the only one that seems like it will get any radio play.Overall, an above average to great disc that the general public will probably not be smart enough to purchase ASAP. Too bad for them, but great for Hiatt fans!"
5,This is Great,"John does it again. I just became a John Hiatt fan about 6 months ago by purchasing his anthology cds and Walk On. I am very impressed by his work and songwriting and would encourage anyone that is looking for great music with impressive songwriting, to look at John Hiatt."
1,It's just not very good,"As others have written, the sound is muddy and the songs all sound alike. One of the appeals of other John Hiatt records is the change of pace, from ballads to country to power rock. Here, there is only one sound, and I can barely listen to a whole album of it. Buy Bring the Family instead."
5,How Are You Gonna Top This!,"This is classic John Hiatt and has ""Emmy"" written all over it. The CD features great lyrics and thoughtful compositions throughout. Slide guitarist Sonny Landreth's, who just released one of his best CD's to date, joins fellow Goner's Dave Ranson on bass and Kenneth Blevins on drums to form the back drop for Hiatt's acoustic guitar and unmistakable vocals. Hiatt has put out some excellent material over the years but none quite with the consistency of this release. Hit's abound from the opener ""Uncommon Connection"" through the closing number ""The Most Unoriginal Sin"". Simply top rate with a new favorite each time you listen."
3,This is easily NOT his most overtly rocking album...,"Quote..Amazon.com review... ""this is easily his most overtly rocking album...Sorry Amazon.com., stand corrected, after you listen to his actual OVERLTLY rocking albums...Perfectly Good GuitarLive at BudakonBoth records feature the massive lead guitar of Michael Ward who left soon after to waste his talent with Jacob Dylan's band ...The Lame Wildflowers."
2,Incredibly disappointing,"Compared to recent albums like Tiki Bar and Crossing Muddy Waters, this latest is most notable for the lack of versatility diplayed by the highly talented John Hiatt. I'm not surprised to hear that it was recorded in 8 days- it was probably written in half that time. If you're new to Hiatt's music, go pick up a copy of Tiki Bar and listen to the differences between ""All the Lilacs in Ohio,"" ""The Tiki Bar is Open,"" and ""Farther Stars"" and you'll see what I mean. Versatility is interesting- similarity, no matter how perfectly executed, is bland."
1,If this had been his first it would have been his last,"People who wring their hands wondering why the great Hiatt has never received all the attention he probably deserves need look no farther than this album for the reason why. Good songs without a doubt...but buried in a muddy mix and sloppy production. Even under the best circumstances, Hiatt's tortured attempts at singing can be tough to take. On this album, his voice sounds electronically distorted and echoey in a fashion that makes it even more annoying."
1,Unblelievably Bad!,"I understand that Hiatt wanted to change his sound a bit, but an entire album of retro NewWave synth tracks???? Unbelievable! The backing tracks are done completely with sythesizer as Hiatt lamely attempts to evoke the likes of Devo, Flock of Seagulls, and Simple Minds. Believe me, he sounds ridiculous. His gruff bluesy voice is completely inappropriate for the new wave songs on this album. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."
3,Great Tunes- Bad Sound,"I am a huge Hiatt fan and think he is one of the most under appreciated talents of our time. His voice, guitar playing and songwriting ability combine to make him a true artist and craftsman.One of the things that I always enjoy about his CD's is the sound. The stripped down basics of ""Crossing Muddy Waters"", the warm atmospherics of ""Tiki Bar"", the country soul of ""Slow Turning"" all give those releases a certain unique feel and signature.That's why this one is a disappointment. The songs are good, and the writing strong, but am I the only one who thinks this thing sounds like it was recorded on a dictaphone? It may be the most harsh, tinny, inferior quality recording I've ever heard.Hiatt deserves better than to have his work sound as if it were pre recorded on AM radio. I'm looking forward to hearing how some of these songs song live."
3,"I love John Hiatt too, but this sounds like a rush-job to me","Yes this rocks, and there are some catchy hooks, but I felt little emotional connection with the material. In my opinion, Hiatt should've either allowed the songs more time to develop, or else waited until he had a stronger batch of tunes. We all want to support our personal musical heroes. I just saw Hiatt and it was one of the best shows by any artist I've witnessed. And yes, the studio and the stage are different creative arenas. Nevertheless, IMO, this is just not up there with his best work where the music AND the lyrics AND the performances all shine."
4,Just a novelty but funny.,"I did enjoy this book.Its not really something you would take with you on a holiday to France.Its more of a good humour book.Its really a novelty book.Plenty of phrases here to learn and laugh over.It even shows you how to pronounce each phrase.Thats a good thing you wont find in many books.For the money its a bargain.Makes an ideal giftAnd,Its a good laugh."
4,Ha-ha-ha! Hee-hee! Hoo-hoo!,"Well, I don't think I will be using many of the phrases in this book unless I truly want to offend someone. Still, it was fun to read and is useful for gaining a better feel for the more ... ah, ... ""colloquial"" applications of the language. I bought my copy about 5 years ago in San Francisco and I found myself chuckling and laughing in the bookstore. I wish the author would expand it beyond its 64 pages."
2,Worthless,"I'm french and I bought that book for my american wife who is learning french. I thought that it would be a good book so that she can progress with slang.The book itself is just completely wrong, probably because it was originally written in 1959... so slang and wicked catch phrases have changed a lot since then! Almost all of them just sound silly for any french guy in 2009."
5,Madcap humor and wonderfully crowded illustrations,"""Are There Any Questions?"" features Arnie the puppy's first grade class' trip to the acquarium. The educational aspect is unintrusive and the humor is madcap, complete with children's irrelevant and irreverant observations, their explorations into alligator pools, tummy upsets, leftfield questions, worrisome wanderings and innocent mischief.Everything goes on at once in cartoon illustrations that accurately reflect the chaos of a field trip. Children will enjoy exploring crowded scenes to discover all the activities a menagerie of first-grade animals can get up to."
3,Mostly cliche but the dog is great,"Artie Deemer, jazz afficiando, lives off the commercials featuring his dog, Jellyroll. That's the most original thing in the book which is otherwise filled with cliche New Yorkers - mafia heavies, artistic types and such. I bought the book because a reviewer said it was funny. While it isn't glum, I'll take a Janet Evanovich any day for more laughs than this book. Bottom line -- an ok read if you happen upon it, but don't go out of your way to chase it down."
4,Much better in person,"I received this as a gift and wasn't sure what to think at first. After I took it out of the box and had it in light, it is a beautiful piece. The crystals are elegant, not like gaudy rhinestones."
4,4 Great Movies,"All 4 movies are about 30 min. My boys like each one, but the fire truck is the favorite. They are all very kid friendly and not only show lots of different vehicles, but explain how they work, what they do and other interesting facts."
2,Fire engines tec.,This is not made for little ones. There is too much talking and too little actual machines for the kids to look at.
1,"Awful, just awful.","Good: music is pretty nice.Bad: The producers of this set should be ashamed at the absolutely horrible quality of these DVD's. This was produced in the era of High Definition and should have been shot in 1080p, but what the hey' a good DVD produces decent picture quality right? This is not a good DVD.The presentation of the visuals is an absolute mess and quite literally defy's all human reason. It's a widescreen image framed in a 1.33:1 frame, and there are even black bars on the sides of the frame...WTH? Furthermore the original footage has hardly any sharpness, it's borderline blurry. Looks like a horrible VHS port. Bad.Thankfully I got this as a gift. It's now in the landfill. Using the box to store my daughter's craft stuff.Do not buy."
2,Too much music and snapshots. I wished for detail & historical facts,The best disc is #4. It is not overpowered by music and actually has informative information regarding the buildlings. The other disc sound canned and only snapshots and loud music.
4,Light Viewing,"This set of DVDs comes in a metal tin with the lighthouse on the cover impressed right into the tin for a raised surface. The container also has a button that activates a short audio of pounding surf and screaming seagulls. Very impressive. The 4 DVDs show helicopter views of the lighthouses and some up-close shots of historic details such as doorknobs and recessed windows. Photography is great. There is a commentary with historical details, but this only fills about half of the audio portion. The rest is very soothing music that adds to the relaxing views. My tin came with a bonus CD of music and waves, but the sound quality and the music/surf combination were not pleasing. I likely will not listen to that CD again. One other feature that is a bit annoying is that although there are 4 DVDs, several of the lighthouses are included on at least 2 of the DVDs. Without this repetition, the lighthouses could likely have been put on just 3 DVDs."
2,Good to fall asleep on.,"I really like anything on Lighthouse, but I should have read the reviews on this, I thought it was going to ne like a documentory on the lighthouse featured. While some of iy was narrated, some of it was showing pictures of the light houses and it was a good thing I can read so I knew whre the lighthouses were located. I was really disappointed."
4,Acoustic music from the heart,"There's so much over-produced music these days that you rarely get a chance to hear the kind of truth and heartfelt emotion that comes from the real thing - the raw performance of a singer-songwriter with a lonesome guitar. This CD features the real thing - the acoustic guitar, the heartfelt vocals, and compositions with spirit and meaning. Listen to ""My Little Girl,"" ""Home Again,"" and ""Through the Rain,"" and you'll find yourself sifting through memories of long ago - of things you've known, and of things you would like to imagine you've known. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes to hear a real performance with all of its inherent subtleties left intact."
4,Promoting my Website,As an amateur promoting my website this book caught my eye. Using several tips from the book I was able get my website ranked higher in search engines. This has increased traffic on my page and has given me many more sales and has helped me with my business.
2,Get another book on this topic,"The book has a website given on page 13. Try to find the website using a search engine (Altavista for example). I tried the search using every word in the books title and wasn't able to find it in the first 20 pages listed in the search. If you buy a book on search engine placement, the proof should be evident in an actual search. Must I say more."
4,"""Gird on thy star, We'll have this out with fate.""","This is a collection of Pound's earlier verse, and items he particularly did not want published in Personae (Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)). It's a shame, really, because some of these poems are pure gold, and demonstrate a lyrical quality to Pound's verse of which most casual students are unaware. For instance, we all learned ""In a Station of the Metro,"" but how many of us learned poems like ""The Summons"" or ""Vana?"" Pound's gifts were manifold, and this book makes that quite apparent on just a cursory reading. I drop it a star simply because I cannot always palate Pound's taste for archaic language, and think he could have benefited from his own American dialect. That being said, Pound--for me--is the master, and this an excellent collection of his work."
2,Not true Anne Klein quality !,"I have three pair of these exact shoes that I purchased from Macy's and they are GREAT, but these are NOT. I wore the shoe's maybe three times and the side of the shoe split open and not just a little to the point were they probably can't be repaired. Now I see why they were only 24.95 and the others were 69.99 and I thought I had caught a deal. Joke on me ! !"
3,"Bonitos, pero de muy buena calidad",Creo que mi esposa los disfruto durante el poco tiempo que se miraron bien ya que muy rápidamente pierden la buena apariencia!!!
4,perfect weekend shoes,good for driving and walking. the leather is hard at first but softens in time. very classy design
3,Pink Fairies - 'The Golden Years 1969 - 1971' (Cleopatra),"To my knowledge, this is one of about three Pink Fairies domestic releases on CD. Starts off with two songs the psych nugget ""Ten Thousand Words In A Cardboard Box"" and ""The Sparrow Is A Sign"" which both are penned by Twink, the band's drummer and were pulled from his 1970 solo effort 'Think Pink'. Other notable tracks would be the demo for ""Do It"" and the nineteen-minute live version of ""Uncle Harry's Last Freakout"". There are a couple of rough mixes of ""The Snake"" and the oldies standard ""Lucille"". The Pink Fairies would be best described as psychedelic garage rock. As far as I know, Twink and bassist Paul Rudolph semi-exist today as the Pink Fairies. I encourage you to check out their first three lp's out now on import CD, 'Never Never Land', 'What A Bunch Of Sweeties' and 'Kings Of Oblivion'. You won't be sorry you did."
4,"Gritty and rough, but that's what you'd expect","I don't remember where I read about the Pink Fairies (this CD ends three years before I was born) but I've always been interested in pre-70s punk or hardcore, and I decided to check it out. The music was terrific; THE SPARROW IS A SIGN and their superb cover of the Beatles' TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS were probably the best. I must agree with the first reviewer, though; if they could manage to improve the sound quality (which was pretty abysmal) or remaster it somehow, it'd be great..."
3,A story retold in a refreshing way.,"The tragedy of Mayerling continues to intrigue us. I didn't learn anything startling in this book that I had not read in other books, but it was easy ready and the drama is as fresh today as it was a hundred years ago. We still don't know what was in Rudolph's mind when he killed Mary, and we cannot comprehend anyone agreeing to die at the brink of her adulthood for a dubious love to say the least. The intrigues that went on before the Great War, are still echoing in Europe today. How little the world changes."
2,Inaccurate purple prose for the most part,"This book is somewhere between biography and wishful historical drama. Barkeley is extremely unfair in his representation of Rudolf, but in the opposite way of most; he paints an overly rosy and inaccurate picture of the Crown Prince. Barkeley blatantly ignores unsavory facts, fails to give sources for statements which contradict most known evidence and sources (notably why Crown Princess Stephanie was rendered incapable of having more children), and over-romanticizes events in excessive purple prose.I would only moderately recommend this book for the most hardcore of Rudolf buffs, because there are some interesting direct quotes not found in most other English sources and pretty pictures. But otherwise, your money would be more wisely spent elsewhere."
3,Johnny Guitar Watson,I received this item within 10 days of ordering it; my older brother is enjoying it.
5,The Hips Masterpiece,"I've seen the MH at least 8 times since 1998. It's always a blast! My favorite phase was 2001 - 2003. Unfortunatelynow they rarely play anything from this 2001 CD. Maybe ""Big City Girl"". However this CD is so great that that song is the weakest tune. If you like Buffalo Springfield, early '70's Dead, Wilco, Jayhawks, and Beach Boy harmonies, then this band is right up with those others. Great songwriting from both guitarists.See them live, but buy this treasure-trove of classic songs. They are both a great recording band & a killer live band. Over the years their shows have gone from song-based to more extended jam-based. But they are one of the most seasoned live bands you will ever see. They've created their own little galaxy & are the reigning masters of it! That most Americans have missed out on this national treasure of a band, doesn't mean you have to!"
5,an undiscovered gem,"David Payne is one of the most brilliant and insightful students of family at work in this country today. The prose is lapidary; the three first person narrators-- husband, wife and 12-yr.-old Joey-- authentic and distinct. This book is a stirring, if unnoticed masterpiece."
1,PNY card is [bad]-- Zero Stars,"I bought a 128MB PNY flash memory card for my Cannon Digital Elf while on a weekend trip in Chicago. When I returned home to download the pictures, a few were corrupted giving the CF card error message. I figured it was a fluke and reformatted the card. Took the camera to Cancun and took about 10-20 pictures a day with a failure rate of about 25%. Went skiing a few weeks later and took about 80 pictures of which about 40 were unretrievable. I repeat, if you want to keep your memories choose a different memory card."
1,a disappointment,"I bought a card with my camera in January 2003 and loved how many photos I could take. However every now and then, some photos would come out as a corrupted image and I often had difficulties downloading images to my computer. The biggest disappointment occured when at the END of a girls night out weekend in Vegas, the card died altogether, stating a CF Card Error, with a lot of great shots and movie clips...gone. Thanks for a renewed skepticism of digital recording."
1,Buy a different brand!,My girlfriend's Canon S230 Powershot camera uses the 128mb PNY flashcard. Recently we started getting errors. The memory gets corrupted and we lose pictures--lots! It also becomes a problem to download the remaining pictures as we are forced to download them one at a time. Customer Service at Best Buy said that they have seen a lot of problems like this with PNY flash cards. When I called PNY customer service for a replacement they said that this happens with memory cards after a while and that I should just keep reformatting the card. Now every time I take pictures I wonder which ones I'm going to lose. Try a different manufacturer.
1,PNY card is a piece of [stuff]-- Zero Stars,"I bought a 128MB PNY flash memory card for my Cannon Digital Elf while on a weekend trip in Chicago. When I returned home to download the pictures, a few were corrupted giving the CF card error message. I figured it was a fluke and reformatted the card. Took the camera to Cancun and took about 10-20 pictures a day with a failure rate of about 25%. Went skiing a few weeks later and took about 80 pictures of which about 40 were unretrievable. I repeat, if you want to keep your memories choose a different memory card."
1,Total waste of money,"I bought this card for my Nikon Coolpix 2100 and about 50% of the time I get ""this card cannot be used."" The seller told me something was wrong with the camera and gave me a new one that did the same thing. I have also had similar (though not as bad) problems with the 64mb CF card, too. I will never buy a PNY CF card again. I have no problems with the Kodak 64."
2,A waste of money,"I haven't had the reliability problems spoken of here when used in my Canon A70. However, I have had compatibility problems when trying to download using a third party USB 2.0 card reader. This is the only brand of compact flash that was incompatible out of four others I tried. I was forced to download directly from the camera at USB 1.1 speed.Also, this thing has a write speed at least half as fast as other CF cards available (except for Sandisk). It slowed photo operations significantly."
3,Truly Not the music from the vinyl LP,"To set the record straight, this is indeed a soundtrack. But if you were hoping this was a new CD release of the wonderful old vinyl LP entitled ""Songs from 'The Jungle Book' and Other Jungle Favorites,"" this isn't it. A reviewer below lamented this (and another reviewer dismissed the lament, mistakenly claiming the first reviewer was thinking of a read-along storybook album...). If you, too, loved the versions and arrangements on the old song album, copies of it are still available for sale on e-Bay in its familiar vinyl format (with the orangish brown record jacket). The new CD soundtrack offers the songs as they were performed in the 1967 movie, which were fun and fine but not at all quite the same as the way these were performed by the movie's original artists for the ""Songs"" LP. A potential buyer with nostalgia should know the difference, so that you get what you're truly wanting to hear again. Best wishes!"
5,One of life's bare necessities!,"As much as I try to think of one, I can't picture a more fun Disney soundtrack than ""Jungle Book"". As a matter of fact, it's even hard to think of a happier soundtrack altogether. And the truth is, the music is so much at the heart of this amazingly fun Disney classic, that they are almost one and the same. There's no listening to the songs in here, without jumping up and down like Baloo, Mowgli and Bagheera. It is a highly recommendable album and movie combo, indeed one of those ""bare necessities""! :)"
5,The best Disney album ever,"This is the best bunch of songs ever. My 3 yr old has listened to it every day for almost a year & She knows the words to the choruses. If your child likes dancing around, this music will make them bounce around like no other!"
1,Jungle Book,This music does not include the lyrics from the animated movie. A disappointment. Whats the point of this album if you can't sing along to the tunes?
3,Jungle Book CD,"Good, but we were disappointed with the mix of music. Many of the songs included were NOT chosen to be included in the movie and there is a long discussion about the making of the movie. Interesting for adults, not great for kids."
5,Great soundtrack,This is a great cd it's wonderful and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them
4,"Classic Songs, but would have preferred more editting","I love the songs of The Jungle Book, and so do my preschool-aged children. These songs are exactly the same songs from the movie, with the same performers, and the lyrics are included inside the CD. A few other songs are thrown in (not nearly as memorable), and a highly entertaining interview of the creators of the music is also interviewed. The one downside to this CD is that some of the songs on the CD start with a lengthy musical introduction -- ranging from 25 seconds to over 1.5 minutes. Sometimes the intros are musically related to the songs/lyrics that follow, and sometimes they are not. It would have been nice if the 'muzak' portions had either been cut, or at least given their own 'number' on the CD, so it would have been easier to skip over them as I drive in my car. Otherwise, I love it. We listen to this CD almost every day."
2,Not like the original vinyl recording,"I was disappointed with this CD. I purchased it because the vinyl edition that I had as a child was so good, I just had to have it on CD. But unfortunately, this recording contains NONE (or almost none) of the original dialog to support the telling of the story or even to help the songs keep their meaning. If you are looking for that, I'd suggest you just purchase the DVD instead. The music is still good...Louis Prima and Sterling Holloway (who also does the voice for Winnie the Pooh) are terrific. And Phil Harris IS Baloo the Bear. Too bad this recording doesn't capture their complete performances."
2,It's really HALF the soundtrack....,"Yeah its great that you hear the songs from the movie. HOWEVER, its a regurgitation of the past CDs that were put out that left so much of the dialouge (FROM THE MOVIE) out. These classic songs now have these HUGE instrumental breaks that takes most of the punch out of them. And this dialouge was FROM THE MOVIE, not from the storybook vinyl album that we had as kids. Some of these songs don't even make sense without that dialouge, and definitely weakens this CD as a whole. The Louie Prima classic is KILLED by this, and so is the ""Bare Necessities"". SUCH a disappointment. It's like the people who put this together 15 or so years ago (this version is the same as the ones from like 1990 or so) didn't even listen to it before they put it out. Or just didn't care..."
1,Not the original kids soundtrack,"This was a great disappointment. As a child I spent hours listening to the Jungle Book record. While it did not follow the movie songs exactly, it was a KIDS album, for a KIDS movie. There were songs that were not in the movie, but again geared towards kids. Now that I have kids of my own I wanted to share it with them, but instead I get something that is made for adults. If you remember the album as a child and want it again - THIS IS NOT IT!"
4,Solid Toy/Game for the Family,"When we told my MiL that the kiddo had taken to Tic-Tac-Toe, she found and bought this beautiful set for her to play with. The result? A fun time for the kiddo that is durable, organized (less chance of losing a piece with the leather tabs and side holders!), and beautiful enough to display.All in all - Recommend."
2,Better off with a pen and paper,"My kids love tic-tac-toe and I love Melissa and Doug products so I thought this would be a winner but it is actually a waste of time. Use just a sheet of paper and a pen, it is more fun and a whole lot cheaper. A total waste of money for us."
1,Face plate pops off,"A very cool looking watch, but we have sent six (6) of these suckers back to Nike Parsec Service Center. To their credit they keep replacing them, but we are going to ask for something else this time. The Presto Cee has a semi-rigid one-piece wristband and I think that has something to do with the face plates popping off. Or sometimes water gets under the face plate just from hand washing. Looking on the Nike website I think they don't offer any watches with the bracelet style wristband anymore."
3,Sonny as Yakuza,"This ""Trilogy"" is actually a rather loosely-connected series of films that happen to have the same leading character (Mas Oyama).I really believe they are not particularly well done. I didn't get any sense of an attempt to explore the character of Oyama Sensei. The Karate sequences were nothing special and I was not made aware of what, if anything but raw strength, distinguished his style from that of any of the other characters represented in the film. If someone were a true Sonny Chiba fan then the films should be in their collection. Otherwise, see if you can rent them or borrow them from a fellow fan."
4,Simple stories using simple plots,"This collection of short and simple tales appears to have been written by high school age people. Each story is based on one simple plot element and that element is only modestly developed. The level of each story is one where late elementary school students could read and understand it. Therefore, presented at that level and with the understanding that the authors were probably not professional writers, this book is worth reading."
3,"Okay, but could have been better","For a book that touted the fact it would be full of interesting pictures, the promised photos weren't that prominent! Don't get me wrong--there are a lot of interesting images--but I expected them to be larger, with more direct commentary ... a focus on the images, the photos, and their connection to the history.Instead, the book reads like a typical JtR book, with a lot more illustrations. Trow makes a few good points, though, and the last chapter is really, really interesting. Worth reading, but don't expect too much on the picture front."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as other books.","Jack the Ripper continues to taunt us over 100 years after his murder spree. Theories come and go, but if you're looking for THE reference book on the Ripper, order Philip Sudgens book."
5,What a treat!,"What a treat! A great bedside book to dip into with relish. I love the wit and stylishness of West's writing, as well as the fascinating stories behind the words."
1,Was this written by a nutcase?,"I agree with the other criticisms here, but I just have to add that half-way through this book, I found myself reading passages aloud to my mother (an old English teacher who was visiting for the weekend), just because they were so jaw-droppingly strange. We were in hysterics, and started making up our own word entries in the West style (usually mildly scatological and totally arbitrary). I can only imagine what the author must be like at parties.... For a fun but educational read about our wonderful language, try Bill Bryson's ""Mother Tongue"" or ""Made in America"", or Bill Walsh's ""Lapsing into a Comma""."
1,Self indulgent,"A fascinating subject. Unfortunately, the author insists on free- association, self indulgently telling stories from his life that you dont want to hear,and imposing opinions like a tiresome relative at Thanksgiving. In fact, the author seems to have so little respect for his audience that some of his sentences and paragraphs are nearly unintelligible. This is one of the few books that I ever returned."
4,Heavy Duty!,"I ordered these last week, they came very quickly! When I opened the box they were much bigger then I expected them to be. They are also very sturdy, a little heavy even empty but they look nice and I like the tops easy to put salt and pepper in and I won't have to worry about the salt bottom always coming off! The salt comes out nicely because the holes on the top are not super big so that was a good thing also. Like I said they are a little heavier then I thought but all and all a very nice product!"
5,Really nice true to picture but bigger than expected,These are very nice but they are a bit bigger than I was expecting. Not huge but about twice a big as salt and pepper shakers that would see in a restaurant for instance. But I love them and the color is true.
2,"Would be ok, but...","Just got these shakers so don't know how well they work yet. Like the size and color, BUT they both say ""SALT"". The box was disposed of before I noticed this so guess I'm stuck with them."
3,H U G E salt and pepper shakers,"Wow! These things are HUGE! They're a scale of salt and pepper shakers that I've never seen before. These shakers arrived exactly as described: 3 x 3 x 3 inches. I didn't notice the size when I ordered them but really should have paid more attention.That being said, they're beautiful red glass. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with them because they are so large and would probably be difficult to use if filled with salt or pepper. I currently have them on my counter as a decorative piece. I still like them, just question who has a use for shakers that large."
5,Great addition to any toolbelt - holds different size hammers,"I carry around a claw hammer most of the time I'm working around the home, but I've never had a good place to put it on my tool belt. Typically, I'd stash it in the large part of an electrician's bag on my 2"" leather tool belt, but the hammer would often hit other things in the bag area, and would be a little unwieldy.Rather than buy a $20+ 'carpenter's bag' to weigh down the other side of my tool belt--just to carry the hammer--I bought this hammer holder. It is very sturdy, with thick leather, and a single piece of metal riveted onto the leather. My claw hammer fits perfectly, and in a pinch, I've also used my medium-size rubber mallet in the holder.The belt loops seem to be designed perfectly for a 2-2.5"" tool belt, but could work (probably slightly loose) on a smaller belt.Highly recommended if you ever need to bring your hammer with you, and hate bending over to grab it every minute."
3,"""Craft"" being the operative word","This book is ok. It shows step-by-step how to complete many projects. I just thought the projects were pretty daggy and a bit ugly. I can see how you can learn the technique, I just wasn't very inspired. This book is more of a craft/hobby style book.I also bought 'The Art of Enameling: Techniques, Projects, Inspiration' which I think is a fantastic book. If you are serious about making enamel jewellery I would recommend this book instead."
5,Enameling Instruction Made Easier,Excellent book to help you with this fine art. Will definitely recommend it to frineds and fellow artists.
3,i actually might need this,i'm actually breeding bettas for the first time and my baby bettas are starting to get older and some are showing aggression which need to be seperated but i dont wanna take them out the spawning tank as it would be more maintenance so this would actually be really helpful with the aggressive ones. Of course i would NEVER recommend using this for a perminant adult betta home.. that is just cruel. it would be like you being in a prison with no yard time.
2,Another VICTIM,I too was excited about an afordable machine that could do what I wanted.The first surprise was that the drivers that came with the unit weren't for WindowsXP. I learned that after I tried installing them and then was told to reformat my hard drive to remove them and download the correct drivers from the website.Then the machine worked well for about 2 years.I sure wish I'd have read all the reviews before I purchased a bunch of ink last month.I was having some difficulty with paper jambs that started a few months ago and then the magenta ink stopped printing.I noticed those problems mentioned a several times before in reviews. Like I said... another victim.I will take everyone's advice... time to look for a different brand and don't waste my time trying to get it fixed.
1,"Zero stars! Bad product, poor service!","This is the worst printer I have ever used. It's noisy, slow, color reproduction has deteriorated badly. Now, it has ""machine error 41"", and they're telling me it will be $150 to fix. It is slightly beyond warranty, and Brother will do nothing even though this error has been rampant and looks like a result of poor quality control on their part.About the best use I can think of for this piece of trash is ""BOAT ANCHOR""."
4,Good buy,"This is my first multifunctional item, and I am pretty happy with it. Setup was easy, and the print quality is good. The only downside that I see is that the scan speed is slower than what I have been used to from my previous flatbed scanner.I would buy it again."
2,Not very good...,"Perhaps I got a lemon, I don't know. It keeps telling me that I'm out of black even though I'm not. When I put a new black in, it says I'm out of black still, then it won't let me print at all anymore. I bought just a year ago. Ink is expensive. For that one year I had it it was a good printer. I guess one has to buy a printer every year, I don't know."
2,can't print black only,"After using this machine for several months, it flashed the need for all three color cartridges. It still had black ink, but (as I discovered at their website) this machine will not print if ANY one ink cartridge needs replacement. It appears that cartridges have a microchip that prevents refill and reuse, and ""knows"" when you re-insert old cartridge."
2,Buyer Beware,"Pros: Many features and a low price.Cons: You get what you pay for.We purchased this product because it seemed to have the most ""bang-for-the-buck."" Combo color inkjet printer, copier, flatbed scanner, fax machine for $80 (on sale) at Staples. Seemed too good to be true.Well...it was. The print heads have to be cleaned every few days - it takes about 5 minutes to finish - else the output is crummy. This is a real pain, especially when you are in a rush to print something out. Never had any problems with any of the HP products (2 laserjets and 1 inkjet) that I have owned over the past 15 years.Once the printer heads are clean, the overall performance of the MFC-5100C is adequate. The scanner resolution/quality is nothing the write home about and the printer output is not outstanding (even when set to the highest quality) but is ok for most of our needs.Now would I purchase this unit if I had to do it all over again? Probably not. I'd probably spend more money and buy an HP."
3,Excellent print quality (when the print head is clean)...,"I've owned this unit for well over a year now and would recommend its purchase if you have limited funds. I needed a fax machine and a copier but didn't have much money to spend, so this fit the bill perfectly. It sends single or multi-page faxes flawlessly and the color copies are excellent. My only complaint is that over the last couple of months it won't always print blue, even after changing out the cartridge (which aren't cheap providing Brother with a comfortable regular income). Until I get it fixed, I'm using it mostly for faxing. I'm giving it only 3 stars because the excellent print quality barely lasted a year with only occasional use. I suppose you get what you pay for..."
4,come on get one,I put 4 stars because I am having a hard time to understand the fax setup but actually it should be 4 1/2 because I love this thing. I am not good when it comes to directions.reading them is out of the ? and I have this thing working all the time. GREAT MACHINE and I NEVER comment on anything expecially computer related.......
1,Pure garbage! But very tree-friendly.,"I don't usually take the time to leave reviews, but this printer drives me nuts and I have to talk about it!I'm with the dude who pulled an ""Office Space"" on it and went to it with a sledgehammer. I've not yet encountered the errors and print head issues others mention. Just daily use of the thing (which I try to avoid) is insane. Eats about 5 pages of paper per printed page, makes this god awful screaching sound when it's out of paper...then makes an overly long beep confirming the lack of paper. The printer consumes ink by the barrel and disables half the features if it runs out of one particular color.I want my old Apple LaserWriter 16/600 back (over 10 years old, 10,000+ pages printed and it never failed me)...never should have gotten rid of it."
1,Brother MFC - 5100c Malfunction,Printer was not heavily used but still consumed large quantities of ink. Print quality was satisfactory to begin with but deteriorated within the year. Head cleaning did not help correct the problem. I was advised by brother to replace the ink cartridges which I did. This did not resolve the problem and I began receiving the dreaded error 41 code. Upon calling brother I was informed the print head was likely bad and that the printer was out of warranty. I was given the name and # of two service reps each of which indicated this had been a common problem. I was quoted head replacement at $150 - $200. Needless to say I now have a somewhat expensive boat anchor. No more brother products for me!
1,Number One In Paper Jamming,"i have never owned a printer that jammed so much in my life.photo quality is good, but S L O W and you MUST babysit the paper feed.brother really lost credibility with this one ...."
1,Error 41,Dreaded error code 41 and I have no way to do anything. This MFC is a total piece of junk and I rue the day I was stupid enough to buy it.In some ways I am happy it died because now I will go out and buy a decent machine from a reliable company that cares about their customers and their image.GOOD BYE Brother. May your stock drop to zero and your rip-off company go down the tubes.
1,Crummy print quality and an unreliable machine,"I bought my Brother MFC-5100c about 2 1/2 years ago, and used it very moderately during that time. The print quality was never that great, and towards the end it just got worse. Finally, I got an Error 41 message, and I knew the unit was toast.From what I gather, Error 41 indicates only a print-head failure, but disables the whole machine. It is especially vexing, then, that I cannot send outgoing faxes or do any scanning, despite the fact that those subsystems are not broken at all. I'm thinking of moving to a desktop-size laser printer, and would rather not have to spend extra money on a new scanner or fax -- but it looks like I must.Error 41 seems to be a frequent failure across the Brother MFC line, and the inability to use the remaining functions strikes me as a poor design choice on their part.If you want quick, sharp printing, long life and reliable operation, it would seem to be best to look elsewhere."
1,Agree with the sentiment - big piece of crap,"bought this unit for my 76 year old mother. What a piece of crap this thing turned out to be 1 year down the road. Printer stops printing magnetta, despite three different cartridges being tried. Cleaned the heads etc. Additionally, their printer drivers are the worst I've ever seen. They utilize 100% CPU through some sort of polling mechanism and cause excessive disk thrashing too. STAY AWAY !"
3,ok machine,"The MFC work right out of the box is a good point. No problem, but the quality is not acceptable, I have to run clean printhead 4 times with-in 1 month of take owner-ship of the machine. Take 4 minutes to print 1 page color superfine mode with picture, and the quality not superfine at all. Faxing and PC-Fax are good, fast. Scan is find, I run it with Win98sec. The machine already print 400 pages so far with 4 times clean printhead I think that to much compare to My old HP for 4 year never have one time clean printhead beside when you replace ink. I love flatbed and ADF as well, Had no paper jam so far. I need on/off swith."
2,The infamous Error 41-- Get free service from Brother,"I am not happy with MFC5100C. I do think Brother should recall this product especially because of its infamous error 41. I had mine replaced by Brother having had error 41 within warranty period. It happened again and it's beyond warranty. I called Brother and surprisingly I can send it for repair ""at no cost"". Well, I gave them feedback how the error 41 has created distrust amongst users based on my Internet research. Having the same problem and it is beyond warranty? Call 1800 276 7746 (you may get other numbers from brother.com). Get your Serial Number ready. Good Luck."
1,Do Not Buy A BROTHER copier/fax,It is the Error 41 that one of the previous reviewers mentions that makes this a terrible product. I bought two of these - one for two separate locations. One came up with ERROR 41 within about 3 months - Brother replaced it at no charge. Within a year the other one came up with ERROR 41 - it was past warranty - and now the one they replaced has ERROR 41. The price is not worth it. I have no trust in Brother.
1,Buyer beware!,"By its own admission, Brother shipped this product to dealers with a critical part missing. The result is that about 25% of all pages jam when printing thereby resulting in waste and extreme frustration. When I called Customer Service to voice my dissatisfaction, I was assured that Brother would over-night the part to me. Naturally, the part did not arrive. When I called back I was told that the part was on back order and the rep could not provide any e.t.a.If you want to buy this product, make sure that the part is included."
1,Watch out for lemons!,"Given the positive reviews I've seen, I must have gotten a lemon. Had some minor print quality issues in the first year, solved with the surprisingly helpful tech support. Once the warranty expired, however, I've had one problem after another. First it stopped printing in black at all, requiring me to throw out a brand new cartridge and buy another new one to solve the problem. Both paper feeders (top document feed and back paper feeder) jam fully 80% of the time. Now goes through ink very quickly. Next time will spend a little more for a better quality machine."
1,If only I had read the Reviews,If only I had read the reviews I would have Known the USB cable is not in the box........ How do they expect ya to be able to install and begin using this product right away. Its bad enough I can not find the slot to put all the ink cartridges but to know that even when I figure that out I still will not be able to use this till I locate and purchase a cable.. After saying a (few choice words) I decided all I can say is smluck Just My kind of LUCK..........
2,About Buyer Beware,"Really I am writing to see if the person that wrote the review about part missing, could explain what part was missing."
1,Worst multifunction machine you could buy!,I have owned mine for 1 and 1/2 years. Error 41 for a 3rd time! Also Brother increase the cost to replace the print head to $59.95! Rip off!
1,"Never, EVER, buy anything from Brother","I bought 2 Brother printers in the last year for my office, a 5100c and 5200c multifunction respectively. Neither one of them made it more that 9 months before the dreaded Error 41 occured. These are not the only model printers from brother that experience this god awful problem. While, as an IT guy, I could never recommend an HP computer for anything other than a paper weight, I can easily say it would be a very good idea to purchace an HP printer over a Brother anything on any given day of the week. Avoid these products like the plague, unless you enjoy wasting money on flawed product that will need to be replaced sooner rather than later. If i had the option, i would give this NO stars at all."
2,Ink abuse,"This printers quality is low, even on higher settings.After 5 pages of prints, printouts are fuzzy with speckles all over. The ink usage is insane, we've already spent the cost of this printer on ink.Installing was a bit difficult, because a key part I needed would not automatically install. I called customer support and they talked me through, but unless you're a computer guru you would be cluless.Faxing, scanning and copying are okay.I highly do no recommend this product, unless you want constant stress."
2,"Junk, but if you have it here is how to deal with it","if you WANT to be able to just use black only you can put black electrical tape over your empty cartridges on the ""front"" of them. It's the part that faces you when the cartridges are in the machine and. Put the tape from the label (where it has the bend in the cartridge) up to close to the top and the laser that the machine uses will no longer detect an empty cartridge."
1,Brother is Very Unreliable,"Years in the IT industry and much experience with Brother MFCs going back years. Always recommended their products -- until now. Got the dreaded ""Machine Error 41"" on my MFC3420C. And it eats ink like crazy, even when not used (cleaning function) -- very expensive. Another lousy feature is that if you are out of any of the three colors of ink (magenta, cyan, yellow), then you cannot print in black, even when you have plenty of black ink. So even when you never use color, you still must regularly buy and replace colored ink.Stay away from Brother. They used to be a quality company, but no more. There are other more reliable MFCs out there."
1,Please don't buy this!,mine broke in 1 yr just when it was out of warranty..poor design and quality! print quality bad!sacnner is the only saving grace!
1,ERROR 41 !! - Real Piece of Junk !!,"Look at all of the reviews below - Error 41 - I have had 2 in the last 9 months - each time the units are replaced by brother with units that have been refurbished (Probably error 41).Unless you have more time on your hands then you need and reliability is not an issue, get something else. For all of us that have already been ripped off - someday a class action suit must be in the cards !"
3,"Kind of fun, but I prefer the later Berestain bear books","This is a fun book with some excellent learning points to it, but I think it has lost some of its magic with time, and certainly the later Bear books are much more popular with my two girls.This, I think was the first of the Berenstain Bear books, Papa bear gets sent off with his son to buy some honey - but of course a smart bear doesn't buy it from the store, a bear finds his own honey.The search takes Papa and his son through all kinds of adventures, as Papa bear teaches his son how to find honey - looks like, tastes like, feels like, smells like and so on. Like I said, these are nice learning points.Anyway, a nice read but not one of the favourite kids books - the Circus of C and Bike Lesson are much more fun Kids books in the Berenstain range."
5,To Bee or Not to Bee a Honey Tree,"The Big Honey Hunt is delightfully humorous with silly Papa Bear. Papa Bear doesn't want to get his honey from a store, oh no, he wants to go on a honey hunt. Finding the right kind of tree that houses honey turns out to be more challenging and hazardous than expected. Finally, Papa Bear finds a tree that looks, feels and goes buzz buzz like a honey tree, but ends up getting his honey at the store after all."
4,We like this one a lot,"This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books, and it shows. Despite the cover, the bears on the *inside* of this book are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books. Also, the book is more of an early reader, it rhymes and is nowhere near as wordy as the newer, $4 books. (Tell the truth, I like all these older Berenstains better!)The little bear and his dad go out to get honey, but of course they eschew the honey store *right next to their house* and go on, surprise, a honey hunt.You can already tell that this Will Not End Well. After a series of predictable mishaps, they end up (predictably) buying honey at the store after all, much to the delight of the little ones.This one is a *little* long for toddlers. Save it for the older pre-readers, or the ones learning to read."
5,A Classic,"This book is another that was a favorite of mine as a child and that my son (2 yrs.) loves. We read ""honey"" every night. He likes to point out the bee on every page. The story of Dad showing his son how to find honey is a cute one."
5,very good,"I bought the left and right, they both installed on my 2002 Santa Fe like a charm.They installed with no problems"
5,Seems to be great!,I have just started taking organ lessons at my church and this book was recommended. I have just started using it and it seems to be well done. There are some great excersises which is what I am focusing on right now.
1,Misleading Description! Cheaply Constucted!,"I purchased this game based on the description of the quality construction, which for the most part, was validated(?) by many reviews. I was extremely disappointed with the reality. Wood construction? No, I would call it compressed wood dust...not even sawdust. I didn't even find the painting to be aesthetically pleasing. The picture of the game at Amazon does not depict the reality/poor quality of the product. Mancala is a great game...find another board, not this one. Lastly, I will state that indeed, you can hang this, as indicated, on a wall. unfortunately, my walls would not accomodate a product such as this one."
5,FDR Our Greatest President,"This book is about a dying president. The doctors knew that our president was dying, but did not have the scientific knowledge to reverse his disease. Still, inspite of his illness, the president did a phenomenial job of leadership. No chief executive before or after has been able to match his performance. If there was a flaw in presidential leadership, it was the failure of FDR to prepare HST for the presidential job. I guess he did not expect to die."
3,Melita Take 2,"My wife really wanted this. My Brother's wife had one and said it was easier to clean up than a regular sized coffee pot. Most reviews talk about problems when using the two travel mugs. So did we. Turns out that the two spouts totally rely on the coffee maker to be perfectly level side to side. Here is the trick to make it work. Pick a permanent place for the machine to sit. Put two paper cups so they each get filled from one side of the spout. Slowly, slowly pour water with the filter removed into the basket where the filter goes. When one of the cups is getting full, stop. The full cup side is too low. I just put a couple pieces of scotch tape on the two rubber feet on the bottom of that side. Repeat and adjust by adding tape. Took two tries and they filled perfectly evenly. Thats the secret to get this machine to work. Otherwise, it seems to be a handy machine."
3,Melitta Coffee Maker,"This is a nice coffee maker. I like the fact that I can make a carafe or a travel mug. I seem to have trouble with the grounds spilling over the filter often, not sure if it is me or a design flaw."
2,Too dark,A little scary for a two or three year old. The pictures are beautiful - but a little dark and spooky. Maybe great when he's older.
5,A beautiful journey,"I love this book. The prose is simple and lyrical. The near monochrome illustrations are beautiful and complement the text perfectly. And the setting - Murlough, Co Down, Ireland, near the author's home - is gorgeous. I have to confess that it's my home too. The walk that the mother and daughter take, through the dunes to the sea, begins at a point no more than 400 yards from the house where I grew up.Even if it weren't such a sentimental favorite for me I'd still recommend it strongly. The simple story and the drawings and the calm meter of the evocative prose make it perfect bedtime reading. Both my children loved it even before they knew the area as Granny's Big Big Sea."
5,This is THE WAY LIFE SHOULD BE for all kids - young and old.,"Beautifully illustrated, and a wonderful story about going to see the sea in the moonlight. I had tears in my eyes from the wonder and joy of the little girl as she ran into the water in the moonlight and ""there was only me and the Big Big Sea."" What a great mom, to wake her daughter in the night to go get all wet in the moonlight! Such a wonderful memory to give a child. I'll look for more by this author"
3,depressed Garcia meets a creepy Kartheiser,"Andy Garcia (Twisted,Godfather part 3) stars as a psych professor who suffered a loss in his family when his teenaged son took his own life. Many years later he is divorced and has custody of his teenaged daughter, played by Linda Cardellini (Tv's ER, Scooby Doo). Garcia agrees to help out a former student, played by Teri Polo (Domestic Disturbance, Meet The Parents), because she is working on a case that involves a kid, Vincent Kartheiser (Tv's Angel, Dandelion), who seems to be keeping a secret deep inside himself and soon Garcia is plunged in a web of lies and so on. Vincent Kartheiser is the only person who fuels this thing in place. Garcia produced this project but I didnt really care for his charcter. He was just to bland. Some good moments but yet again Garcia weighs it down a bit."
5,The Unsaid Says It All,"This movie stays with you long after it's over. ""The Unsaid"" speaks volumes about how you can totally miss what is going on with a person. Andy Garcia is a Psycholoist who has lost his son through suicide. His acting is superb in his portrayal of a man in the grip of grief and guilt. But through an opportunity to work with another young man, he is faced with his own demons and those of the young man (brilliantly played by Vincent Kartheiser). There are twists and turns and edge of your seat suspense up until the very end, which ends on a positive note. I found myself watching this movie more than once. But be prepared because the emotions involved can be quite intense. Having a teenager of my own, I could relate to many of the relationships in the movie. Looking for something a little different, I was surprisingly fortunate to stumble onto this gem."
4,A Little Known Gem Of A Film...DEFINITELY Worth A Sawbuck!!!,"WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE!!!I picked this movie up to rent on a Saturday (as there was nothing else left on the shelves). I hadn't heard of the film, I am not a HUGE fan of Andy Garcia & also wasn't familiar with any of the other actors in this gem, but I have to admit that this film was excellent!Lots of drama, mystery, violence, psychological games & a great surprise ending. THE UNSAID is highly intense from the get go & has you continually thinking and trying to predict the outcome. Interestly filmed also. I don't wanna give the film away so... I highly recommend this for viewing. What a great price of $[price]. Highly worth a SAWBUCK, I'll tell you that!"
1,Don't Let These Other Reviews Fool You!!,"This movie is a boring waste of time. Remember to set your alarm clock before you start the movie! Yes, It could have been a good movie with the cast, but is wasn't. Not done well, but acted well-OK! This movies script should have had rewrite all over it. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't like it."
1,Don't buy this,"DO NOT BUY THIS. I bought this case without reading any reviews and found out the hard way that this case is not practical to protect 300$ camera.1. No cover to keep the camera secure (You don't want to loose your 300$ camera with a 15$case.2. This case doesn't cover the camera all the way this causes one side of the camera exposed to rain etc.. and if you drop it you can damage the camera.3. Belt clip is open on one side for easy clipping which can make the clip to easily fall of as wellBottom line ""Don't buy this"""
1,Don't get this case,"I thought it was a good idea to get a case that can clip onto my belt, but the case kept falling off. One time I actually found my camera on the ground with the case still clipped to my belt. If you want to lose your camera and/or the case, then get it. My case is now floating in a lake somewhere. Luckily, I moved the camera to my shirt pocket before the case fell off."
1,Too Big for the Z4U,I own the Casio Exilim Z4U. This case is too big for the camera and the clip isn't as good as other clips I've seen and used. I am much happier using an iPod case to carry my camera as it fits much better.
2,Exilim review,"The product doesn't show a picture of the back of the product. In the back, this product has a huge belt holster very heavy and inconvenience. It takes a lot of space. Therefore the product wasn't what I was looking for. It is not practical"
2,Falls Appart,"Mine fell apart. The clip's pin must have snapped and slid out, because if that's not the case, then they designed the case very very poorly. Last week I almost lost my camera after not hearing the case fall off, and went hysterical. (It later turned up.) You'd figure name brand stuff would have some quality. After dealing with the thing falling apart and putting it back together, and over again, I finally lost the little metal pieces the last time it fell off my belt, and now I'm in the market for a new case. I really liked this one because it attached to the belt and was designed to complement my Exilim Z-70. I initially liked it so much, that I might give it another chance. Caveat Emptor."
4,Does the job,"The EX-CASE3 holds my Casio camera securely, and the camera has never dislodged itself without my help. I don't often make use of the belt clip on the back, so I would prefer if the clip were removed and the whole case was made slimmer. However, the clip has stayed tight for the years I've had it, so I can't complain."
4,Excellent resource for psychologists and counselors,This book provides an excellent framework for creating groups to work with students with impulse control and anger issues. The lessons are easy to use and described in great detail. I also liked that it is suitable for youth up to age 11 or 12.
4,Good part of this series,See what I had to say on the review for book VI. I wouldn't mind books if reviews were not required.
4,nice,no problems with products they had it shipped to me promptly and the product was in good condition the cover was in good condition and and as for the info they gave about the book before i bought it was right on the dot for what i got
1,"streaky, don't work well","I bought these because I found a good deal on them. However, they leave suds and streaks on my stainless steel appliances. I purchased the Weiman brand and compared side by side. Weiman is by far better and worth the extra cost."
2,blanket too small,although blanket is quite and my puppy loves it.... the price was only $1 but by the time you pay shipping it came to $8. I think $8 is too expensive for a blanket the size of a hankerchief.
2,"Cute, but the head fell off after 5 minutes!","This toy is pretty cute, but after my 7 month old puppy had played with it for about 5 minutes (at most), the head fell off. She is not a destructive dog; actually, this is the first toy she has broken. The head did not tear, it just fell right off the blanket!"
2,THIS IS...NOT...A BLANKEE,"LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER SAID..IT LITERALLY IS THE SIZE OF A LG HANKERCHIEF...SOMEONE SAID ITS ROUGH? IT DEF IS NOT ROUGH....MY FIRST BEAGLE WHO I BOUGHT FOR 2 1/2 YRS AGO..PLAYED WITH THE HEAD A LITTLE..IT REALLY JUST SAT AROUND.....THEN THIS PAST JAN 2011 I GOT A 5 MOS OLD BEAGLE...SHE FOUND IT AND SHOOK IT AROUND THREW IT IN THE AIR AND PLOP..THE HEAD CAME OFF.....BUT THE BLANKET STILL IS LAYING WITH ALL THE TOYS,,,BUT SHE STILL LOVES PLAYING WITH THE HEAD...WHEN...I GO AND GET IT AND PLAY FETCH..ITS HER FAV..IF IM NOT INVOLDED..THE HEAD...JUST LAYS THERE LOL SHE DOESNT PLAY WITH...BUT ITS HOLDING UP SO FAR WITH OUR PLAY TIMES....."
4,Queen Duchess love it,my puppy Ms.Queen Duchess love it she carry it around the house with her the only thing bad was the stiching came off after her chewing on it but she puppy and that what they do
4,Nice blanket!,"Nice blanket, too bad that it's only 15 inches......hope it comes in large size....great for small dogs, tea cup size, but not mid size dogs."
5,It squeaks,"Major plus that it squeaks. My puppy likes to toss it around and whip it against the carpet. It's small though, even for a chi-weenie puppy. Really just a toy, not a blanket."
1,Dissapointed,I really didn't realize that it's a very very small blanket...and my puppy is only 3 pounds. Not happy with it.
5,Adorable,Just the right size. The bear fell off after one washing but that made the blanket function better. Such a sweet soft lightweight blanket
5,Super Cute!,"My little 4 month old Shih Tzu loves it! Wish it was a little bigger, but she sleeps with it every night."
3,NOT VERY SNUGGLY,"The size is not mentioned. So let me mention it. It's about 12"" X 12"". The material it's made with is soft but it's not quite flexible so as to be able to snuggle with it. I hope that makes sense. The teddy head on it, didnt last very long on it."
2,GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ....,I wasn't expecting much for the $6 I paid but this was still disappointing. The material is kind of rough and it's very small like a handkerchief.
3,Beware,"While I love the di zi, it is unwise to purchase this flute without also purchasing di mo, which is the bamboo reed paper needed to cover the membrane hole. If this hole isn't covered the flute does not play with it's unique vibrating tone. The di mo can be applied with chinese herbal glue, or simply with garlic juice."
3,Huge Downer!,"This movie is not as much about Tribe as a group as it is about Phife finding out he had diabetes and basically breaking up the group. Spoiler alert: the stuff about Phife and Q-tip as kids was entertaining, but then it got really depressing and just showed them fighting for the rest of the movie. Poor Ali got stick in the middle and he really got screwed IMO. I would have really liked to see more performance footage, more about the good times and more about the music! I would not recommend this film."
5,What the...,"This was great! I learned things about music and about the Tribe. It is a must own if you are a music fan. I think that it was to the point and necessary with a mellow soundtrack of the bands best work. I love to know that they are going to try to make it, after the drama because I would not have wanted to see them perform on stage if they were still beefing behind the scenes. Bands, especially one's who are like family, are always going to beef. I am not talking to most of my family right now for disagreements we've had! Life goes on and everyone makes up when they can. Overall, this is mos def a must have on the shelf for reference."
5,hip hop junkie,if u grew up as i did with all these beats bumpin on sony walkman (cd player) then u going to love this flix
3,The easiest one...?,"Since Will Oldham took on the name Bonnie Prince Billy and started recording in a studio the songs took different forms too. Now there's a little more room for a little more different sounds and gentler instrumentation.This CD doesn't have any songs that I would put in my all-time Will Oldham top 10. But then, the guy has written so many good ones in the last 15 years.It's a very laidback album, the lyrics are a little more upbeat than in his Palace days. He definitely shows that a good song is sometimes more important then a slick performance. But, like Oldham, Dylan and Neil Young have already showed that.There are no bad songs, no top songs but just a pleasant 45 minutes of craftmanship.The reason I have given this album only 3 stars is to compare it with his other albums, so of which are better and some clearly better."
5,surrious.,this album rocks. maybe not in the traditional sense but in a kind of la la la way. rully good.
2,Folk Pastiche,"Bonnie `Prince Billy, Will Oldham's latest incarnation/side-project, continues his by now comprehensive exploration of mushmouth Americana/Anglophilia. His voice, reminiscent here of a tubercular Paul Simon, limns his faux folk conceits with olde English verse and awkward syntax. That's not, in concept, a terrible idea (see Fairport Convention, early Richard Thompson, Nick Drake), but Oldham's third-hand songs, unfamiliar with irony, nevertheless have the uncomfortable presence of pastiche, each one a genre exercise in quotes. He breaks through on one track - the plaintive, melancholy ""After I Made Love to You"". Oldham has his reputation, and his claque, certainly. Those who enjoy his work will find plenty of beauty here. The rest of us can listen, learn, and move on."
5,Smoking hot CD,"Disk 1 is incredible. Although I have had this CD for more than a month now I have yet to listen to disk 2 because of the crazy copy protection. If you are 100% digital like myself then you may have problems ripping and playing disk 2 on the computer also. Don't give up though. Its not the copy protection that is/was the problem. Its bothed copy protection. Accoding to the tech support organization you should be able to rip and play within Windows media. However, disk 2 still cannot be ripped and played in Windows media. I ripped and played disk 1 on my ipod and within itunes no problem. Contact kinkysweet and they will replace your disks. I believe AfterDark San Francisco and AfterDark Chicago were the only ones that used to have copy protection. The newer disks do not. Enjoy!"
2,Computer/IPOD problems,"I agree with the prior reviews - this disk tried to load software to my computer, that my virus checker killed, and it caused problems on my computer.And the upload to the ipod, was off - it didn't load clean. I am taking this back to the store, if I can't rip it to my ipod, I'll never listen to it.I don't want albums, that load software to my machine, and I don't want albums that I can't load to the IPOD"
2,same thing over and over,Guess I've been spoiled by the Hotel Costes compilations. This was basically the same mechanical beat in every cut--very disappointing because we were looking forward to the whole Afterdark series if this one were good.
3,An interesting exersize,"ArcView Gis Exercise Book appears to be a valuable tool. It is a tutorial based on data included on on a CD. Persons interested in this book and accompanying CD should be aware that running the tutorial requires alteration to the autoexec.bat file, knowledge of DOS commands, and a fair amount of time and patience when attempting to open a project. A stream of queries regarding locations of files can take up to 30 minutes in an attempt to open a project to begin a particular tutorial. Default settings for ArcView startup will be changed with the modifications required."
1,ancient history,"I have contacted the author because I can't get the CD-rom to work. This book is ancient history, and comes from the age of Windows 95."
4,"More user-friendly than ""Inside ArcView GIS""","The book goes beyond ""Getting to know ArcView"" and includes the important tools someone needs to begin to take advantage of AV 3.x. I wish the book, or an associated one,would get into the extensions and more powerful uses of the software."
3,Good for a low budget movie,"This was surprisingly good to me. The main guys were very real and authentic. It's about 2 gang bangers who are in love with each other and trying to find a way to be together while living such a dangerous life at the same time.I just wanted to knock some sense into them so they would get out of the gangster way of life, but they just get even deeper into it. I don't like the ending but I'm impressed with what they did with such a small budget."
3,Average,"It was okay. The plot of the movie was nice. Although it was low budget, that was not the issue. Just a lack of romance which caught me off guard. Overall it's worth watching though."
1,what a piece of $#*t!!!!!!!!!!!,"ok, i am a gay male, i lived in big cities, small towns,and everywhere in between,and have yet to hear anyone refer to thier special someone as ""bro"" gay or straight. the story is boring, the actors are boring, but at least i know what to give to someone i do not like for christmas.this is a step down from getting coal,at least coal has use like you can burn it for heat, or it will turn into a diamond, i advise to use it for heat ,you might be waiting for awhile if you chose the other"
2,Worse than I expected,"Low budget movie picture about love between two gangsta brothers.There are many positive responses to it, but I ain't gonna echo them.Poor quality of sound and picture doesn't help to enjoy it either. And the dialogues? I know that gangsta slang has own rights, but ""f..."" and ""sh..."" used as ""commas"" don't make the action move faster or the characters sound more realistic."
2,DOWN LOW,WELL WELL WELL ... What have we here!!!????!!!OH OH I can answer that...A very bad movie!!!!Yes the guys were kinda cute.. the story line BAD..IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE!!! AT ALLLLLL!!!PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.. RENT IT.. Im just trying to help you here...
2,On Da DL,"Thiz Movie was VURRY-Much-So on a Budget. I lyked that it was about Hispanic Characters. It shows'z what lyfe can B lyke on the DL N a Gang. Thiz Movie takez Place N Chicago. Weak Begining & Middle, Lots of Profanity & Explativvez, Good Ending!"
5,Justice Deferred,"This documentary was powerful and inspiring. I would recommend this for all law students and law practitioners. I have been out of law school for 11 years and this case reminded me of how important it is for for lawyers to adhere to the highest standards in the profession. Mario was let down by his lawyer, and by prosecutors who failed to adequately investigate and interview witnesses at the party. This case shows how laziness can impact the innocent. A must see and a must purchase for any DVD collection."
3,when the courts fail,"A teen is wrongfully given life in prison and this documentary covers how multiple parties work hard to get the conviction overturned. This work shows how the courts do not guarantee justice. This shows that many people in prison may be innocent, that ""innocent until proven guilty"" may be all talk.The work shows Mario as a nice guy and positive person. I do wonder if activists would have taken the cause of an inmate who was bitter or not as talented or family-oriented as Mario. The work shows people of all ages, races, professions, and genders supporting this cause. Still, so many people in prison wrongly are low-income people and young men of color that I was disappointed about how ""racism"" or ""classism"" barely is spoken in this work.This documentary is very important, but I do think it ran on the long side. People who strongly oppose the death penalty and people who live true crime narrators, or court television for that matter, may really enjoy this documentary."
3,not as good as i thought it would be,"ok so you do feel so sorry for this guy and his family , but the film, nto so good, kind of drags on and it is quite boring."
1,Both cats got sick from this!,"I switched to this from Eukanuba because my 3 year old cat was getting constant itching. Well, after a little over two weeks on this food, both cats developed diarrhea that got progressively worse over time.I went out and got Eukanuba lamb and rice and both cats got better within two days.I had high hopes for this one but it made my cats sick."
5,You'll want this one...,"Nosferatu's latest release sees the band adding an extra dash of keyboards as compared to their previous album, Prince of Darkness. If you liked any of the other Nosferatu albums, you'll enjoy this one as well. Solid gothic rock with great vocals and superb orchestration!"
3,Awesome-to-middling,"Most of the songs on this CD are competently performed, but a bit uninspired. The title song is a tremendous exception; in my opinion that song alone is worth the price of the CD. It starts out with a steam organ playing a kind of ""Lucifer At The Circus"" theme. Eventually, the bass joins in, and the rest of the band follows suit. But what makes this song so special are the vocals. I have friends who say that they love the song but can't stand to listen to it because those vocals are so scary. If you like Gothic metal (Type O Negative and Sisters of Mercy, for example), this would be a good addition to your collection."
1,Ball chopper!,"I bought this for my 98 and during its first match it fired about 5 shots and then began chopping the paintballs before they reached the chamber. I cleaned it, went back out, and it did the same thing. It ruined my day and I still can't get the inside of my gun clean from all the paint spray."
4,Great item with a few caveats.,"The loader is great but if you have an alpha black, the power valve most likely needs to be swapped for it to operate. Tippmann will send one to you free of charge but it'll be a week long wait. The number to call is 1-800-533-4831. Call when you order the loader and they might arrive at the same time."
5,Tippmann is an awesome company with cool products!!,"No problems at all with the cyclone. It's perfect and works with my 98 custom pro in every way. I love it, you won't be disappointed. Easy installment too."
4,A.B. dose it again,"A.B. is notoriuos for bringing up normal stars and making then super stars,this here is no diferent.Volumen X is a great Kumbia group with great hit like(Sigo pensando ti,Como te olvido Y De lado a lodo).this cd is a club bager & has Hit written all over it."
1,Flimsy pieces,"My 2 1/2 year old was interested for about 5 minutes. The pieces are flimsy and won't stay together. My 4 year old didn't even last 2 minutes with the puzzles. ""It's broken, Mommy"" when the pieces wouldn't stay together."
3,Puzzles?,"These puzzles are very cute. However, with a print being on both sides, it has confused my son.....BIG TIME. He doesn't realize that the one piece he insists on putting together is the wrong side.Maybe he is still too young, at 2 years old to understand."
5,amazing,this game is amazing. I bought this game back in october from japan and I think it's better than the older games although I do have trouble in some parts in the game because it is in japanese.I can't wait for it to come to the US
1,item description,"The descriptions at the top is different from the one in the subtitle. One says Level 5 Unit 4. However, another one says Level 5 Unit 1. ?Please help check. Thanks."
2,A COFFEE TABLE BOOK.,IT REALLY ISN'T THAT FUNNY A BOOK. IF YOUR BORED AND WANT TO BROWSE YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING TO TICKLE YOUR FANCY BUT TO READ THIS BOOK AS A NOVEL WOULD HAVE YOU TURNING THE TV ON SOONER THAN LATER.
4,Good quality first shoe,"My son is 10 months old and I ordered the 12-18 mos size. they are too big for him now but hopefully he can wear them soon. He has thick, chubby feet and these shoes have not been the easiest to get on him. Hopefully his feet will thin out when he starts walking."
1,Failed To Work After a While,"After a couple of weeks of use, the card failed work losing all the pictures from a trip to Arizona. Attempts to format and stick into card readers have failed. For the record, my camera is a Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom.I am likely to think twice about buying another PNY product (I have a third video card by PNY which is adaquete but could be better)."
5,works great,Card works great on my Olympus C-4000 AFTER I formatted the card on a Dazzle reader (the Olympus would not perform this task). So far I've taken many dozens of pictures with great success !
1,Don't buy - PNY doesn't honor their warranty on SmartMedia,"Although you can still buy SmartMedia at many locations as well as directly from PNY, PNY considers it to be an obsolete product and no longer honors their ""lifetime warranty"". Since PNY currently considers ""lifetime"" to be the commercial life of a specific product and will not offer any alternate compensation for defective ""obsolete product"", I cannot recommend purchasing any PNY product."
3,Smart Media Flash Card,"My Olympus camera uses the Smart Memory Flash Card, and I like to keep 3 or 4 cards so that I can organize photos and do not run out of space when I am travelling. One of my cards stopped working and I tried to find a replacement locally. I ordered one online and after several weeks,the vendor emailed that he could not supply it. Although I would have preferred a card with a greater capacity, the only ones that are available are 128 MB or less. Thankfully, Amazon was able to help me get two of these."
5,PNY 128 MB SMARTMEDIA,THE PRICE WAS RIGHT! I COULDN'T GET ONE AT THIS PRICE ANYWHERE.IT ARRIVED EARLIER THAN WHAT THEY SAID!VERY HAPPY.
1,Horrible experience!!,"I used this card on an Olympus camera, and I got an error statement and it completely ruined 150 photos I had stored. I ended up having to pay quite a bit of money to have them restored. I'll never buy this brand again!"
3,Worst of Jefferson Airplane,I've listened to the Jefferson Airplane since the late 60's and I once had the Vynal of this albumn. I wanted to listen again and did the deed and purchased it again. I still like this music and I am now 62 and beyond some of the music I listened to in the 60's and 70's.
2,Don't even bother!,"Boring! Boring! Boring! If you want to read a gripping account of a Tornado, don't bother with ""The Tornado"". I would recommend ""And Hell Followed With It."" Frankly, ""The Tornado"" was one of the most disappointing books I've ever read! In my opinion, at least half the book is taken up with 'filler'; information about the author, his life, his family, etc! If you do read this book, I'd recommend skipping right to chapter 6!"
5,"A real Find,,,","After one play was not sure just who I was listining to. Smooth touching hooks anlong with a heart in plan view. ""Walking wounded"" is bloody briliant. I have 1700 cd and this one ranks in the top ten! A true angel, please keep playing ,,,,"
4,Enjoying the book but,"Makes me wish I stayed awake in Math class. Some of the text is made up of formulas that make my head spin. However I am enjoying reading the stories of the men and their reasoning behind the explinations of how the world works at the atomic level versus the ""real world "" physics of Newton and others. Definitely a time when what we knew to be true was vastly different from what was actually true."
2,wasn't too impressed,the songs are the songs i wanted but not at the quality i wanted. I had to go back on the net and look for the MP3s for my dance troupe. It's a shame.
4,excellent insight,This book has excellent insight into each parsha. The author is wise and each week his reviews are thought provoking.
2,Not a good video for toddlers,"My toddlers (18 months and 2 1/2 yrs)love the Wee Sing videos but this one did not hold their attention. The songs, characters and storyline are not as appealing as the other videos. They usually dance and sing to the others but lost interest very quickly in this one. They love Big Rock Candy Mountain,Grandpa's Magical Toys and Sillyville."
3,"My favorite video, but it needs a little adjusting.","This is my favorite Wee Sing video, but it needs to be adjusted a little. The story line, in my opinion, just didn't really go along really well with a few things. I think Susie, Johnny, Nellie, Will and the other characters along with the setting were just fine. They fit with the setting very nicely except the elves didn't really look like elves at all. They looked like real people! A few things happened to the Smith family in the video that actually can't happen like- elves can't fly in the sky like Santa, a snowflake isn't a sleigh, and people can't visit the North Pole because it's too cold! I reccomend this video, but I suggest that you fast forward the fake parts."
1,Not A Good Video,"My kids love the Wee Sing videos, but this video was a big disappointment. I found it to be boring and the video could not keep the attention of the kids..."
5,Book is fantastic!!,This book is so well written I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was with Tom throughout the journey. I think I enjoyed the trip as much as Tom did.
3,Balls don't bounce!,These jacks are durable and the box and bag are a nice touch to keep them in. BUT! The two balls included DO NOT bounce. I kept this set and bought a couple of cheap balls to use and will enjoy it with grandchildren. But I wish I had sent it back because for this price the balls should bounce!
1,Not worth the extra money,"I bought these for nostalgic value, wanting to share the fun of jacks with my kids. The balls have seams in them, so they don't bounce straight. Very disappointing, and definitely not worth it."
1,Mellisa and Doug jacks,"I purchased these jacks for my 8 year old grandaughter for Christmas---the jacks are great, but neither ball bounces. How can you play jacks, when the ball doesn't bounce? Very dissapointed !!!"
2,Poor Quality,I was not very happy with the quality of this product. Some of the jacks were broken and the ball would just barely bounce. I would not buy this product again.
2,Not heirloom quality. Balls don't bounce,"It is an absolute misrepresentation to say that this toy is ""heirloom quality"". As the other reviewers have said, the balls don't bounce at all. It makes the game impossible to play (and enjoy). Luckily we had several bouncy balls in my son's toy chest that we used as a substitute. Also, two of the metal jacks have broken already. This is not what I consider heirloom quality."
5,NIce,Easy install! Bright! Looks great! And moast of all they work. They just plug into the existing harness and BAM! DONE!
5,Rammer is A World Out Of Time,"Call it ""Rammer"" or call it ""A World Out Of Time"", regardless of the title of the book it is a MUST READ for any Larry Niven fan. Do not expect to see any of the ""Tales From Known Space"" or even any of the wonderful creatures that populate Larry's universe. But you will be spellbound by this alternate vision of Earth seen through the eyes of Jerome Corbell. ""Revived"" after 200 hundred years after being frozen to prevent death from cancer. Watch ""JayBee"" cope in a world beyond his worst nightmares. Imagine the prospect of being ""mind wiped"" if you make a mistake. This is just the start of a strange journey covering space and time for Jaybee Corbell - corpsicle."
3,"Captivating story, published under another title","I didn't realize that I had this book under another title until looking at the synopsis here.... A World Out of Time... It is an excellent and captivating story, and possably a warning as our technology is fast approaching this stage. To wake up in a world that is a police state, rebel, and possably find a version of the fountain of youth."
3,Is that all?,"This is a very short book. Well book on tape. If your a fan of Larry Niven and you have read A WORLD OUT OF TIME then don't even bother. This is basically the short story that Niven grew into the full book. The reader is quite good but a little too on edge at times and seems prone to giving random inflections to any old word. If your a Niven fan, pick it up. Too bad it's so short. An entire reading of A world out of time could have been fun."
4,The Best DVD Peart Has Done Yet,"Short and sweet...if you are pondering between this package, A Work in Progress, and Anamoty of a Drum Solo...pick this one. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because he didn't bring out the old set up to do a true time machine and perform the songs as originally played and not with the cutting corners.Otherwise a great product."
4,Questions,"Why is this not out on Blu-Ray, most all other stuff is. I would love to buy if it were on Blu-Ray."
2,Full transcriptions NOT included!,"I'm a nearly lifelong Rush fan, and I was ecstatic to see the product description here at Amazon that said ""transcriptions of Neil's parts included"" in a PDF...be warned, however...the actual material included is just ""excerpts"" and not the full charts. I nearly burst several blood vessels until I read the note at the end of the eBook that says ""a forthcoming companion book will contain note-for-note transcriptions of Neil's performances from the Saratoga TimeMachine concert (also included on the DVD)."" We'll see."
3,Essential goods for the true Neil Peart fan,"Being a huge Neil fan, I pre-ordered this on Amazon and was happy when it arrived earlier than first expected. However, it was advertised as having ""behind the scenes concert footage"" so I guess I expected to see how the band (as a whole, not just Niel) prepared for a concert, what there routines were etc. and was disappointed to see that other than Neil warming up on a small kit, this type of footage is not included. However, the rest of the content was just as advertised and the interviews are very well done and moderated by someone who definitely knows music (especially Rush music!), and drumming. They also shot most of the footage in some interesting locations that I recognize from reading his motorcycle touring books. I find it quite interesting that growing up, Neil was the ""ultra private one"" in the band who never granted interviews or tended to not show up at the ""Meet and Greet"" events, and now is coming out with dvds, books, etc. every year."
3,best of? i dont think so,"Don't be fooled by the title; this is one of those compilations dictated by song rights etc and not by quality. The great songs from the first 2 albums are only here in live versions, while you get loads of inferior later stuff. And what is a greatest hits without Crazy or Titanic Reaction?? Buy the first two albums, which are available as imports!"
2,Not worth the money,"I have been using this printer for 2 years. I got is as an upgrade for another HP printer which stopped functioning!!7210 is OK for ordinary printing, copying and scanning. It takes up more than one paper at a time. Does not receive faxes, but I can send easily. The attitude of customer service was not helpful even to figure out what is going wrong. Since my warranty expired, they charge you $65 even for the first time.Now it stopped both copying and printing.I tried to do all sorts of trouble shooting, but can not get it work. The customer service charges $65 for a single consultation.If I add another $65 I can get a properly working printer. So I am still looking for a good model and brand."
1,JUNK,"Biggest piece of Junk I have bought for my aquariums. Very disappointing since most of my equipment is from PENN PLAX and I have been pleased in the past. However this item causes too much stress on mother and babies leading to death of mother, babies or all. It is MUCH SMALLER than pictured or quoted. Not worthy of ONE STAR. Would send back but not worth the shipping.PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST!"
4,a quality game,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. The board is quite heavy, about 5 lbs, and very solid. The board isn't quite hand painted as advertised, it's more like hand stamped, like you would sponge paint a wall. The colors aren't quite as vibrant as they appear in the picture either. My board has a slight flaw in that I didn't notice until I had opened it, a small sliver of wood missing from the surface, so it didn't get stamped with paint. All in all I'm happy with it, flaw and all. The reason I took one star off is because the day after I received it, I saw it at Marshalls for $14, arggghh."
4,No instructions included!,"I bought this board game (M & D) about 2 years ago --- just got it out for my 8 yr. old son (first time,) & there were NO instructions included! Can anyone help?? When I googled ""pachisi instructions,"" nothing that would simply & clearly help came up! Any advice, other than purchasing another board (which I clearly won't do!) Thanks!"
3,Classic wooden pachisi set,"Sturdy and well-made, but would have liked a box to keep it in. Colours on board rather more muted (drab, even) than those in photo-would have preferred brighter version. Were it not for this, would have given product ""4"" stars."
5,Bueno,"This is Flamenco Pop and it's great. Uplifting, uptempo songs flow one to the next. All in spanish so I don't know what they are saying. The woman's voice sounds a lot like Nelly Fertado, she looks like her too. I have both their albums and Love them! I bought Endorfinas En La Mente and Goodwill and thought it looked cool. I was right! What a steal!"
1,Dissapointment,"Well it very pleasant that a fresh wave of music comes from Barcelona streets to our homes all over the world. I don't where know these band is coming from but it is clear that Ojos De Brujos opened the way for them. So thinking of that i have to say that they can't reach Ojos De Brujos emotional ""breaks"" at all .They seem to put this record in market just to win benefits from Ojos succes till now ."
4,Good collection to own,"For all the guys (and girls), this collection provides some of the best love songs ever written, as the name suggests. My favorite in this collection is Seal's soulful - ""Kiss from a rose"" , which also featured in the'Batman Forever' soundtrack. Undoubedly one of my favorite songs of all time."
2,Needs Work.,"The program is a cute, but incomplete tool for studying a language. It offers categorized quizzes and vocabulary introductions, but these are basically computer-aided flashcards.There is no introduction to sentence structure, and only a hand full of obscure phrases.The only unique feature is the record and playback feature that allows you to here yourself pronounce along with a native speaker.The recorder is helpful, but I think for the price you could get a more complete understanding of Danish with a book/tape system."
5,An Unapologetic Look at a Difficult Life,"This book deserves a lot of publicity and has gone unrecognized for far too long. Masuda's account of a difficult (to say the least) existence as a geisha in a small town in Japan in unapologetic and strangely elegant. Her writing style is spare but she knows just how to convey each experience so that the full impact hits the reader. For someone supposedly so uneducated, Masuda's painfully-acquired wisdom lives on each and every page."
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA!,"SEEMED TO BE LACKING IN DETAIL.NOT THE BOOK I THOUGHT IT COULD BE, MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS A TRANSLATION."
4,A very rich and evocative memoir.,"The most remarkable thing about this book is the author's voice. Although you have to wonder how much was altered in translation from Japanese to English, it is still very compelling. I think with memoirs you can always tell whether the author is trying to gloss over negative aspects of their life, but Masuda is unapologetic and genuine. This is not the soft, lyrical story of Arthur Golden, but the real thing, expressed by someone who was there. A very rich and evocative memoir."
4,Not completely a geisha memior,"The title is somewhat misleading, I picked this book up because I thought it more about geisha life when it reality a small part of the memoir. That being said I did enjoy reading this. It shows the struggles of a woman who keeps on going and tries to make the best of her situation during a time of transition in Japan, taking care of herself and others around her and basically being her own parent. It took a lot of course for Sayo Masuda to write and publish this book during the mid 1950s which was before woman's rights and woman's lib. was in full swing in the United States. As result of writing the book she received a lot of criticism from her village and was driven to move somewhere else."
2,Eh,"I liked the look of these shoes but had to send them back. The strap that goes over the top part of your foot just wasn't comfortable. I don't have a high instep, but the strap just fell in a place where it was very uncomfortable and they had to go. Maybe if there was more give or if there was a small piece of goring where the strap meets the shoe. Or maybe there was but it just wasn't enough, I'm not sure."
1,Not what I had in mind,"I went to a small cultural fair at a local elementary school where families from different countries set up tables and gave out samples of food that would be eaten in those countries. There were several African countries represented, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, and I was very impressed with the spicing of the food so I was hoping to pick up some good spice blends from this book. Well, the only spices represented in this book are ""curry powder"". Not even a recipe for the curry powder blend, just generic curry powder. Additionally, only half of the book is recipes and the other half describes the culture and provides some conflicting nutritional info in the back, e.g. vegetable based diet is healthier except for the Masai who eat almost all protein (blood, meat, milk) and are the healthiest. Some may find this book charming, but it really didn't fill the niche I was hoping to fill."
4,Fred Everything - Under The Sun,"Fred Everything's long-awaited debut, Under the Sun, doesn't disappoint those who have been fervently following his scattered 12""s on 20:20 Vision, Shaboom, and other respected labels. ""Let You Down"" is the kind of relaxed, easygoing house that will have you reclined in your most comfortable chair, ready to take on the evening. But others (like ""Under the Sun"" or ""Universal Mind"") are liable to put you in a dancing frenzy. Certainly, the funk is fertile: ""Another Soul,"" ""Derby,"" and ""Revolution"" have a smooth, sweeping quality to them that exudes deepness. Was it worth it? In a word: yes."
5,"Over Sea, Under Stone",This book was absolutely thrilling. It is by far one of my top five books. It kept me on the edge of seat even the second time I read it!
4,The weakest link in the series,"This book serves as the weak link in the Dark is Rising series but is helpful for bringing Will together with the kids from ""Over Sea, Under Stone."" Short and unimpressive but a must-read as part of the larger series, one of the best works of fantasy this century."
5,Great!!!,"Barnabas, Jane, Simon, and Will seek a stolen grail in Trewissick. A legendary object, The Greenwitch, has half of it. The dark has the other. How will the children get back BOLTH HALVES?"
3,The burning man ... the drowning woman,"The Wicker Man , sometimes called the burning man, is in modern timesassociated with Wicca, but comes from the Druidic traditions of the early Celts. Here a woman's weaving of a wicker woman is the mainplot theme called the Green witch. For me this seems kind of a madeup fantasy that doesn't have the intricate design of an Alan Garner novel.I think it is unhealthy as well to associate the Dark with a gypsy.There is enough prejudice associated with them already. Sagan said it was a ""Demon filled world' that superstition gave us. Adding new onesin a semi-fantasy fashion may not be a real good thing.The novel as part of a series is very well written, but mostlyto motivate you to buy the next one..."
4,Book One continued,"The third continues from Book oneAlong the Cornish shoreWith Simon, Jane and Barney DrewAnd Merriman once moreSomeone's made off with the GrailIt's got to be the DarkThis time Will Stanton's in the mixAnd Barney makes his markThe Grail requires a secret codeTo understand the writingThis fell into the deep blue seawhile Light and Dark were fightingThe Greenwitch claims a soggy prizeThey need to get it backWhile Jane tries her best to be niceThe Dark starts to attackA lone dark minion on a questGets greedy with his roleHe stirs up all the Wild MagicBefore losing controlWill they locate the precious GrailAnd break its ancient code?And will the Greenwitch be appeasedSurrendering her loadFor younger fans of fantasyThis series is a mustSo go tell your Librarian""Susan Cooper - or bust!""Amanda Richards, January 26, 2006"
3,Beware if your skin reacts to stearic acid,"The ingredients of this product are:Rose Water, Sunflower Oil, Stearic Acid (Vegetable Fat), Mango Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Beeswax, Natural Flavor, Grapeseed Oil, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Marshmallow Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Calendula Flower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sucrose Stearate (Sugar Emulsifier), Tocopherol, Beta Carotene, Xanthan Gum (Natural Thickener), Sodium Borate (Natural Borax), Glucose & Glucose Oxidase & Lactoperoxidase (Sugar and Natural Enzymes)Stearic acid is an inexpensive moisturizing ingredient that is on every list of acne-generating ingredients. If you don't react badly to it, you will probably like this. Since learning what causes my acne (it's entirely product-related and stearic acid is the #1 culprit), I avoid it completely."
1,Grease and Oil,"I read good reviews on this product, so I thought I'd give it a try. The smell was a bit much, but didn't hang around long. It was the very greasy feeling that was left on my skin that I did not care for. All other reviews said it was light and ""vanishes"". Mine did the opposite. It was like thick vaseline that clung to my face and actually had to be rubbed in for awhile to get it to ""vanish"". Doesn't all face cream vanish? But it was the very heavy oily greasy smelly feeling on my skin that was the annoyance. I think I will stick to Olay."
3,Smells great but misleading.,"This products smells really good but the name is misleading. It is not a ""Vanishing Cream"" per se, and it says that on the box but it also says they call it a vanishing cream because of how it vanishes into your skin when you use it. However, the latter is not so true. It is a thick cream that definitely leaves a slightly greasy film on your skin, which is not bad if you are going to sleep. In fact, it is what you probably do want on your skin while you sleep. But they should make the word ""Vanishing"" vanish from the box."
2,Sticky feeling!,"I did not like this product. It is a deep moisturizer that is thick and feels sticky. It would be good if you had say chapped cheeks. For every day use, no! It broke me out just a bit with acne due to it's not breathing well. My bottle arrived with a bit of oil floating around on top of a very thick goo. Maybe it was old or something, I don't know, but it didn't look smooth at all, and it just felt too gooey for me. I like the radiance day creme."
3,strong scent......,"I read a lot of good reviews on this product so I brought it to try it out. When I opened the container, first thing I noticed about it is the smell. I don't like it. It reminds me of when I was synthesizing acetaminophen in lab; one of the chemicals used smelled exactly like this creme - synthetic banana. I guess if you like the scent it is fine. The creme is really soft and nice though but I wouldn't buy it again cause I really don't like the scent at all."
5,one of the GREATEST disney soundtracks ever!,"Disney is known for having some pretty nice soundtracks with their movies, but they definately went above and beyond with the soundtrack to A Goofy Movie. I first saw this movie when i was around 10, and even now i listen to these songs and think...wow, this is tight. Stand Out and I 2 I by Tevin Cambell are some incredible songs, on any level. Not only is this a great soundtrack but the movie itself was also good. If you thaught the music from Hercules was nice, check this out!"
5,WHAT A GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!!!,"I know the FIRST thing I noticed about this movie was its GREAT MUSIC!!! After seeing this movie the FIRST TIME I WAS HOOKED!!! And singing this music like CRAZY!!!(The ones that ARE'NT instrumentals). This Disney movie may NOT be the MOST popular, but it has some of the catchiest tunes of ANY of the Disney movies!!! The best songs on here are definetely the songs sung by Tevin Campbell ""1 2 1"" and ""Stand out"". They are *AWESOME* dance songs with GREAT lyrics...""Stand Out"" is one of my MOST favorite songs of ALL time :D!!! ""After Today"" was *always* another one of my fav's!!! :D ""Open Road"" and ""Nobody else, but you"" is good too. And ""Lesters Possum park"" is Hilarious I *Love* it, its a *little* bit of satire on the WHOLE theme park thing...Funny cause considering ""Disnland/World"" hehe. But anyways its *COOL*!!! I'm SURe the instrumentals are *GREAT* too!!!God Bless ~Amy"
3,"Good, Informative but Dull, Dull, Dull...","Good writers can make even the most dull material seem exciting, Coren doesn't engage the reader until half-way into the book. The citation of facts and figures at the start of the book makes logical sense but will probably bore the average reader. In my opinion, only novels are allowed to ""build"" so slowly.As, I ""dog book"" junkie who has read almost everything under the sun on dog behavior, training and history with great fervor and ease, I was surprised at how laborious this book was for me. Normally you can't pry a good dog book away from me...but I was putting this book down almost every 5 minutes because I couldn't keep interested.In the end, it was a ""good"" book but in my opinion there are better authors out there who understand how to balance facts and a logical progression with a little creativity!"
2,Duldrum and Dull Dogs,"Okay. You are exploring an unknown universe, where smells, color, sound, memory and experience take on an entirely different nature. How do you make it interesting? Avoid writing like Stanley Coren. Not only does he make the most wonderful details mundane, but he makes the most mundane details downright unbearable! His dispassionate matter-of-fact approach makes me wonder if he wrote the book just to have one on his resume, or whether he's a finance journalist turned dog-writer. I like heavy scholarly texts, newspapers and everything documentary. But this one missess the mark in my opinion...His personal stories and tests are funny and sometimes even amusing. His description of his dogs makes them lovable and vivid. But the riddle is why he fails to continue writing in that style and why the book, which is a great topic, dies as soon as your eyes hit it. If you're fascinated by this topic, or you love your animals (like me), than pass over this one and find another."
2,Perhaps a good book for someone who has minimal knowledge of dog behavior,"If I could go back and stop myself from buying this book, I would. I suppose if you have never read a book about dog behavior before, then you may enjoy this one. It is a very basic understanding at best, and at worst it is the most boring dog book I have ever read. There are about 8 pages in the first half of the book that are devoted to nothing but listing all the commands that his dogs know and what he uses them for. Excuse me, but I didn't buy this book to read Mr. Coren bragging about all the different commands he has taught to his dogs. That pretty much turned me off for the entire book because I can't stand authors with a ""look at me"" attitude. Also, the entire thing is laid out and listed in a fashion that just makes me want to fall asleep. It isn't the worst book you could ever read about dogs, but there are definitely much better ones that you could spend your money on instead of this one."
1,Not at all what I expected!,The book was not at all a fun read! Almost every chapter was boring and non informative. The book goes on and on and yet you still feel you have not read anything of intrest.
5,How Dogs Think: What the World Looks Like to Them and Why They Act the Way They Do,"Fantastic Book! If you're a dog owner, dog lover or BOTH then this is the book for you. If you want to understand your dog like never before then do yourself a favour and purchase this book. It gives a wonderful incite through the dogs eyes how they see us and why they do certain things. This book certainly goes hand in hand with How to Speak Dog. A must read."
5,An excellent resource...,"...for anyone who owns a dog, plans on getting a dog, or is simply curious about the workings of canine mind. Coren does not over-anthropomorphize, nor does he alienate dogs or attempt to describe them as mere objects for study, as the scientifically minded are prone to do--instead he strikes a balance, admitting that dogs do have feelings and emotions in their own way, but that they are not exactly like us. There really need to be more authors out there like Stanley.The book's contents have been thoroughly researched, the information backed up with some very interesting examples and stories, and the conclusions are entirely believable--for those who aren't stuck under the belief that animals are nothing but organic machines. All in all it is a highly informative and detailed book, but still an easy read and you will find yourself looking forward to reading the next chapter... and the next... and the next!"
1,the screen scratcher deluxe!,"i am a high school student, and on a day to day basis, i ride my bike home. Since i find the ride without music to be very boring, my iPod accompanies me. At school, i am skeptical about keeping a 300 dollar piece of equipment on my belt loop, or in my back pack, its just not smart, so it goes into my pocket. With this case in particular there is a small transulucent piece of plastic to guard the screen. Now you may think, thats great, the screen won't get scratched when really, the exact opposite is true. If you keep it in your pocket, like most people will that value their iPod, the translucent plastic rubs against the screen and leaves it hopelessly scratched, to the point that you can hardly read the screen! My suggestion is to go buy the jam jacket, which i have switched to. the jam jacket has no screen cover, and leaves your screen good as new!"
4,Pretty Decent,"Originally I had the Ipod carrying case, but it scratched my screen like crazy, and when ever I dropped my ipod, the sides would dent >< so i got sick of it and bought this one. it has great protection for the screen, and plastic surrounds your wheel and buttons which is even better. it only got 4 stars because the back was made out of Velveteen, I have no problem with that other than the fact that it caused feathers and dust to come onto my screen, so I cleaned it for 15 minuites and left it in there and it works great."
3,Hoop review,First of all the hoop took about 4 hours to put together and you must be sure you have the tools to use. Also this thing will take about 6- 80 lb. bags of concrete (slab type mix). When shooting on the hoop the backboard makes this sound as if you are shooting against a metal backboard at a schoolyard. Overall though this is a pretty sound hoop and I would say it is worth the money compared to lower priced systems.
4,Good value for the money.,"We wanted a basketball goal that was sturdy, adjustable, looked good in our driveway and wasn't too expensive. This system has satisfied all of those conditions. This permanent installation requires you to dig a hole two feet deep and 21 inches across. We spent $30 on the concrete and rebar to mount the base of the pole, using our wheelbarrow to mix the concrete. The instructions say three adults are required to mount the backboard to the top of the pole, but we managed to do it (just barely) with two adults. Backboard height is easily adjusted using a broomstick from 7.5 feet to 10 feet in six inch increments. The only minor disappointment is the thinner than expected acrylic backboard material. It looks good, but is too flexible when the ball rebounds off of it. Overall a very good system for the price paid."
4,Good though flawed,"As some have pointed out, this is a slow film. I'm a fan of foreign films, which are generally slower paced than American cinema, but slow pacing should serve a purpose - there is a limit beyond which the slow pacing takes away more than it adds. Also, the moral of the film is inherently unsatisfying - not because it doesn't offer some hackneyed happy ending, but because it attempts an inadequate compensatory ending - 'life was horrible and sad, but at least we have this'. It resolves as neither tragedy nor triumph, and though a viewer might feel it's realistic, it neither makes us feel good nor teaches us a deeper meaning. In the end, we have sympathy for characters, but would never wish to identify with them.The B&W; photgraphy is excellent, camera movement is superb, and the directing is precise. Also, the DVD extras are plentiful and of superb quality. In the end, it is a package easily deserving of four stars."
3,Sad but true,"This is a sad story, and it made me greatfull for all that I have today in my life. The movie is well directed and the actors did a good job for a black and white movie.But I don't know if I will watch it again... it's in my collection anyway."
5,visually rich!,aside from the well-crafted story what i most appreciate about this feature is the way the visuals appear as paintings in motion. composition and framing are well thought out and not at all contrived. i am intent on studying more of mizoguchi's works as well as miyagawa's (his DOP). kurosawa isn't the only accomplished japanese filmmaker.
5,5 out of 5 for a great show,"God this show is the best. I personally love the ATHF series in all. I love Meatwad. He is just the best and tied for the funniest with Carl. I can watch ""The Cloning"" over and over again. This show is unmatchable."
5,Just keeps getting better!,"I caught this show late one night on cartoon network and I've been watching it ever since. Following a living shake, meatball and fries, this show is about as twisted as it gets. There is constant death, weirdness, hilarity and each episode seeks to outdo the previous one. This show is hilarious and if you haven't watched it, you're missing out."
5,ATHF Rules,"This series is really really funny, I laugh outloud in nearly every episode. I recommend this to anyone who like raw humor and adult cartoons."
5,Good book.,"the book is really new. the content is good.the shipping was fast besides the ""regular"" shiping.the price was really lower than in europe's sites or librarys.the only thing I was not expecting was the tax for the book to enter in europe, but this was not an item related to amazone."
3,A Jumble of Hiker Entries,"I was a little disappointed in the format of this book. Basically, the author strings together comments and observations pulled from interviews and trail registers throughout the 1996 hiking season. Some comments were certainly interesting and entertaining, but they didn't blend together very well. The epilogue, written a few years later based on interviews of some of the 1996 thru-hikers, was a little better."
4,Author Response,"Those who say I haven't hiked the Trail have missed something very important about the book: it was never intended to be about me! From the beginning I resolved to keep myself and my experience out of the story. Further, those who say I didn't hike the Trail don't know that I accumulated some 400 Trail miles in collecting the comments of hikers that season, and they also discount some of the friendships I made that last until this day.Is it the best book ever written about the AT? Probably not. But is it a true story, told by as many hikers as I could find? Yes. The reader will get perspectives from those who never wrote a book, but who hiked anyway and got wet and went hungry and hurt a heckuva a lot as they made their way to Katahdin."
2,"Misleading title, disappointing content","If you're looking for a book from someone who actually has thru hiked the AT, then avoid this at all costs. I was extremely disappointed in the narrative, which is essentially just a jumbled mish-mash of stories culled from AT trail journals. I couldn't believe a publisher would bring out a book with such an extremely misleading title. Lynn Setzer never walked the Appalachian Trail and the style of the book is disjointed, irritating and uninformative. A massive disappointment to anyone who has thru hiked the AT or someday dreams of doing so. I suppose there is some scant merit in the book, and I did actually complete it, but it was a chore."
4,Class of '96,"I felt the book was well written. I liked the month by month time frame and the way it followed certain people the whole trail. It was a good trade off with ""A Walk In The Woods"" by Bryson who did it the same year."
5,The Best!,"I've kept a list of books I've read over the years on hiking the PCT and AT. It numbers 38 so far. A Season on the Appalachian Trail is one of the best. It's many hiker experiences rolled into one, making the comparisons of a hiker's ideas, feelings, opinions, experiences, vices and virtues, probably the best account of what it's like to walk the AT. Setzer does an outstanding job of conveying vividly what the individual hikers feel about their experiences. The complaint in some of these critiques that the author didn't hike the entire trail is unwarranted. That's excellent journalism. A written account of an event that you observe from a distance but making the reader feel like you're in the thick of things, of which Setzer definitely was. Loved the book."
3,This book is three stars at best.,This book is well written with a lot of good info for the person considering walking the AT. My biggest criticism is it could have been 50 pages shorter without all the fluff. Example - Setzer lists trail names ad nauseum as if she is bound and determined to mention EVERYONE she met while on the trail. Overall a decent book but three stars at best.
3,Fading fast,"These cards were a relief to find, my camera uses them for storage and for transfer to my computer for final processing and I needed some more. The price was right. I was glad to find them, they have already faded out of all of the local outlets in favor of larger capacity units. I do only stills and have no need of the gargantuan capacity. And no matter how large a card is, when it fails it fails, whether you've got $10 dollars in it of $100. Which would you rather lose? I haven't had or used them long enough to rate their quality, but being digital, I think that would be rated in failure rate and not image quality? They appear to function as expected."
1,Did not help,This product did not help me. I recommend seeing your doctor if you are having real menopause issues. I tried several over the counter remedies that did not work. Only after getting prescription medication did I feel better.
2,Didn't help hot flashes,"This didn't seem to make a difference in my hot flashes which were the major problem , ICool seems to do the best for hot flashes for me"
1,Does NOT fit the newer nokia phones,"The point that connects to the phone is of the older type, which is larger than the recent Nokia phones, which is more thinnner."
4,Good Basic Product,"Nokia makes good solid accessories and this cigarette lighter adapter is no exception. Fit,compact and sturdy, just carry it in your vehicle where ever you go and plug in your phone. I keep mine constantly plugged in even when on the phone. Great buy!"
4,"Don't let the cover art fool you, this is the real deal","I was skeptical when I purchased this CD, nervous that the recordings would be scratchy and obscure versions. Nope. This CD is wonderful if you like the roots of folk. It's one of those CDs that when it finishes you're ready to listen to it again. Even though it has 14 quality tracks it seems like a tease, like it should've been a double album. The cover art may be bad but the music definitely makes up for it."
2,"Drugs, Please!","I'm not sure who needs them more ... me after reading this jumbled up mess, or G.M. Ford after writing it. Maybe he had a fever. I am not a fan of the pandemic-there's-no-cure-we're-all-gonna-die novel. Hate them, really. Nevertheless, I am a fan of G.M. Ford so I slogged through this dreck hoping it would redeem itself at some point. It did not. Sorry, Mr. Ford, but you can't be a winner all the time."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Following is what happens when a writer uses a book of fiction to try to get his political views heard by a large audience:1. The book is usually crap - this one is no exception.2. Your audience shrinks.Now that we all know how you will be voting in November Mr. Ford, how about getting back to writing good books again. Thanks!"
3,3.5 stars - Needed a better end.,"It was nice to see Corso working with the police, for a change. And there were a couple other very good characters in the policeman Hart and reporter Sexton. The pace is tense and fast and keeps you turning the pages late into the night. Although I was disappointed with the very end of the book, I shall certainly be first in line for his next one."
2,to be sneezed at..,"The theme is hardly new but Ford can't decide if this is a one man crusade, a police procedural or a disaster story. The narrative and plot feel totally confused. As a result it's difficult to follow and really rather boring."
3,Science Fiction or Mystery?,"I love Ford's Leo Waterman series and the first 2 Frank Corso's, but he starting losing me on the 3rd book and I had to start skipping through Red Tide. It isn't that I don't believe bio-terrorism is possible and maybe that really isn't why I didn't like the book, but that topic is just not what I thought I would be reading about picking up a G. M. Ford. Isn't it enough we have to hear/read about this every day, I wish the mystery writers would leave it alone. I had a hard time keeping all of the officials straight until almost the end of the book and Frank Corso seemed like just another character. The whole book just felt like an author's break from writing a series and attempting a stand alone."
4,Piano Stand,The stand is very secure and holds the piano at the correct height. Should be paired with the matching bench. The only issue that I have is that it comes only in a blond oak finish. Would be better if there were other choices.
2,Nice but would be better with extra piece,I wish the discription would of let me know that you can't rest any keyboard on top of it. Your keyboard has to be a specific size in order to be able to rest it on the bench. This bench is only for keyboards that have at least 71 keys or more.
1,Alone for a long time ?,"The only thing I can guess is that the other reviewer must have gone for many days on her own to find the singer on this disc appealing - I thought it was a girl at first, or not a very good impression of one. The instrumentalists seem to have an idea what they are doing, and it stops there. If only we could erase the voice track...I could take a girl singing, or maybe a cute guy (with a guy voice)."
2,too strong for my taste,"i guess its due, at least in part, to compensate for the fact that they are the low fat varieties, but it seems like fat free salad dressings and sauces tend to go overboard with the amount of flavorings they add. this is no exception. i like dipping or stirring in a little tartar sauce, and thought might as well get the fat free kind... tastes more like tartar sauce concentrate!"
3,"Good, brief study guide","This book is a good, basic review guide for the Elementary Education content Praxis exam. It only contins 1 practice test, but gives good explanations for each question and details the main topics covered in the exam. I found it to be a good place to start my studying, but I still needed to brush up on the actual subject matter. For this, I am using the series by E.D. Hirsch ('What Your 6th Grader Needs to Know', 'What Your 5th Grader Needs to Know', etc.) This series is extremely helpful."
4,If your looking for an Indepth Guide....,"This was a good study guide, if you have a lot of other resource books to study and review off of. It gave a lot of general topics about what would be on the tests and subjects to review on, but it really didn't go into detail like other books, Barrons, etc. would have. It gives a good idea of the test format and what to expect, but other then that not much else. There is a practice test at the end that does help. If your looking for an indepth study guide, this is not it...but it is a good book, if your studying for the test a month or two before the test."
2,Content Knowledge Study Guide,"For the general content knowledge Praxis II test this book was not very helpful. The practice tests were not relevant for this test and I would not recommend for a study guide. - A better choice of study guides is the ""What your ------- grader needs to know"" series. They go from 1st - 6th grade and are a wonderful resource of knowledge to refresh your memory on what you learned in those early years."
2,Only an Outline - You have to Seach for Answers,"This book is only an outline of what to study. You have to search the internet for all the answers. If this is the only book you have, you will feel extremely overwhelmed! This is definitely not for an alternate route candidate who needs to refresh their elementary knowledge. This may be a good study guide for the recent student who just received their bachelor's degree's & everything is fresh in their mind.It does have a practice test that is useful, but so do the other study guide books. Plus it's only 93 questions & the real test has 120 questions.I don't recommend buying it. See if you local library has it. That's what I did.I recommend the following:REA Praxis II Elementary Education Content Knowledge (0014) (this is a brand new book that was release in 8/2008)Kaplan Praxis (by the way the 2005 edition & the 2008 edition are page for page the same).Good luck!"
2,Not helpful,"This product was not helpful as a review for the Praxis II. It listed topics but no review whatsoever. I had to buy another book to review the history, math, science, and language arts. The only useful part of this book was the practice test. Would not recommend!"
2,Now worth the time,"This study guide was not very helpful. There is only one test included, which provides no basis for comparison. Also, in the example section, there are no answers given to the questions. Not worth the time or money."
3,Surprised!,I just recieved this book this week. The book has some good information but I was expecting a little more when it came to the review questions. What disappointed me the most was that I paid $36 for the book used when on the back of the book printed above the bar code the book only retails for $25 new. So I felt like it was a bit of a rip off.
1,Don't waste you rmoney,I bought this to study for the Praxis 0014. This was of no help. I took the test today and there was a lot that was not even covered in the book. I'm sure there are better study guides out there. Unluckily I chose this one.
4,"An excellent book of examples ,of Egyptian Paste [ pottery ]","A well illustrated book , numerous examples of what is known in pottery as "" Egyptian Paste "". Ornaments , tiles ,cups, figurines and the ever present ,beads. More than enough colour photographs to satisfy the thirst . The 3 different processes of manufacturing Egyptian Paste objects are explained technically. Plus ,the many variations in the paste through the centuries. My only reason for not giving another star , not enough goblets ."
4,Scholars cringe!,"When evidence comes to light that maybe we don't know EVERYTHING about the gospels scholars, like attack dogs they tear apart, discredit, or out and out LIE to the public to keep there dogma.This book happens to be a very in-depth source of information. it wasn't the easiest read unless you are a theology major some passages do not make sense to the layperson.Anybody who has studied the bible knows the gospels aren't without mistakes and rewrites by scholars and this book helps us know more about the religon that changed the world!"
3,Does its job,"Its a good cover. I was glad by how lightweight it is. A few things I would hgave liked to know before buying it:1) it doesn't cover the screen. One of the main reasons I bought it was to keep the screen from getting scratched.2) It kind of blocks the buttons. If you have small fingers it's not a problem, but my thumb is too big to tap them. Have to use the index finger instead."
3,OK Case,"I bought this case for my 15GB iPod becasue it was getting scratched and had alot of fingerprints on the back of it. It worked very well in protecting the iPod. It did just what I wanted it to do. But, it had problems. #1) The holes for the buttons where very small, but not a big deal. #2) Once you put the case on, the iPod WILL NOT FIT on the dock. HUGE PROBLEM for me! Also, the case was extremely hard to get off the iPod. Very good case, but BOTTOM LINE, if you use an iPod dock, this is not the case for you!"
5,Outstanding and Beneficail to all Culinairans,This book help those in the business to understand the unlimited use of vegetables and how to present them in a higher fashion. I personally used some of the recieps for vegetarian parties that I was asked to do and gained remarked comments and appreciation for the time and trouble that went into preparing such a feast. My toque off to Chef Trotter. Thank you
2,"Beautiful to look at, but puh-leeze!","The photos are lovely and the chef obviously loves his subject (hence two stars, not one), but really--4 cups kohlrabi juice? 3 tbsp. chopped primroses? Opal basil--like regular won't work? Several recipes with over 20 ingredients each, some of which say ""recipe follows"" so they're not really an ingredient but another recipe? And no substitutions suggested so just in case your corner store is out of, say, hedgehog mushrooms or Cape gooseberries, you can still make an approximation?I am an adventurous cook, and can get a lot of ethnic, organic, and/or exotic ingredients, but this sounds more like hard labor than working with the fruits of the earth--the kind of recipes where you cook to impress rather than to enjoy the process or the product."
1,Who cooks this stuff??,All right is this a cookbook or coffee table book? If you want a book to look at and admire a master's work this book and the entire series are definitely for you. BUT as a cook book it is a waste of money!!! I live in a major west coast city where unusual and asian ingredients are easy to find but I could not find at least one ingredient in every single recipe!! To make things even more frustrating many recipes listed fresh ingredients that were in season at different times of the year thus not available fresh.It's a wonderful book to study how to combine flavors and work on your presentation skills. Be warned before you spend big $$ on this book.
1,Let's get Real!!!!,"While Charlie may be a great chef, his restaurant may be reviewed well, this book does not show real food..... the recipe for cucumber soup with watermelon could not be that green, that is, if you follow the recipe. Where is the real food Charlie??????"
4,Family Member,"This book is very interesting about my Great Grandfather. A little out of order at times but very informative. Great History, I could add to the Geneaology"
2,Where are the crayons?,"The cover of this booklet alludes to more color artwork inside, which there is not.Although, the poses are repetitive, it does display a wide array of bondage themes.Overall, the black-and-white prints left me feeling as though I were looking through a coloring book for adults."
5,Kimbrell has done an amazing job,This book is beyond a book. It is like a movie on pages. The visuals are that powerful.What is revealed in these pages is a secret that must be exposed. Andrew Kimbrell has done a wonderful job here. His work is pioneering a new awareness for the entire world.
5,Covers an incredible variety of topics,"I highly recommend this book; it's a great resource to obtain a base knowledge of many areas of our country's agricultural sicknesses, and more besides. A professor recommended it to me and I found it useful in writing an article that has now been submitted to my university's policy journal. It's a big, heavy book, so save some space on the bookshelf for it. But it's a gem of knowledge you're unlikely to regret finding."
3,Nice looking but poor content,"This item is for those who do not have any vocabulary in Arabic and want to have a feel for it. There is maybe 100 words maximum in this software and this vocabulary can be found in the internet very easily.Besides that, it looks like flash cards, so you need to ckick once to hear say the word (very good clear voices and accent) and you need to click twice to get to the next image. Very neat big images.Children love it.There is also a way to test what you have acquired. I would say this software is great for litte ones. My son likes to repeat after the speakers, but I find it a little boring."
2,This product is not helpful.,"This product does not help at all. Sure it does help you learn a couple of words, but why spend money on something you can find on the internet?"
5,Superb!!!,I got this wonderful equalizer last week and i am extremely happy to say that its changed the way i listened to my fav CDs. The music is sounding absolutely fantastic after hooking upto this device.The finest details could be experienced and the sound is amazing.The Highs are so crisp and detailed... The mids sound amazing... every drum beat or rather any percussion sound gets to the fore and is so much enjoyable.The sub woofer out is an amazing feature of this device not found on most equalizers.. excellent bass out of my sub now. This is truly of audiophile grade for an audiophile like meHighly recommended to any audiophile
5,FBQ1502,Received in good condition and fast delivery. Product were tested and it performs as expected. Product found to be rigid in construction and good quality.
1,bad purchase,"I did not hear any change in sound improvement.The item was working for about twenty minutesand it was very hot.When you don't buy directlyfrom Amazon and you don't have full satisfaction,returning the item is a problem and you lose a great %of the money you paid for the item."
3,"MUY ATRACTIVO, PERO...","Adquiri este equalizador en marzo del 2009 y fue en enero de este año cuando lo puse a funcionar. Debo confesar que su aspecto es muy llamativo, con sus juego de luces en cada uno de los controles de tono, pero en lo que respecta a calidad de sonido este esta algo lejos del HI-FI (comparado con mi viejo Technics SH-8045). Nunca antes habia probado un equipo profesional en mi cadena de audio, ahora que lo tengo llego a la conclusión de que definitivamente, me quedo con el audio hi-fi doméstico de calidad.Equalizer purchased this in March 2009 and was in January this year when I put it to work. I must admit that it looks very striking, with its play of light in each of the tone controls, but in terms of sound quality that is somewhat far from the HI-FI (compared to my old Technics SH-8045) . Never before had established a professional team in my audio chain, now that I have come to the conclusion that definitely, I keep the domestic hi-fi audio quality."
1,Not recommended,"This Carrera track has been a total nightmare. It was extraordinarily difficult to assemble, and one piece of the track has never completely fit into place after repeated attempts. The track does function in this state, however. It is further flimsy and all pieces fall apart easily, the cars' pieces are too delicate for an 8 years old, having fallen off and been stepped on. We couldn't wait to spend hours of fun with this toy, but instead our experience has been more frustration. And then there's the price. I'm so glad I wasted a hundred bucks- like my mama always said, ""what do you think, money grows on trees?"" Guess we lost out on this one....."
5,Excellent Book for Refuting Preterism,"This book is an excellent source for refuting Preterism, a false teaching that is on the rise today. I highly recommend it as a book to add to your library."
1,Not for preteens...,"I personally do not think that I would use this book at all for any age child or teen, but I am very concerned that its ""recommended"" age range is 9-12. I wouldn't want my 9-year-old child seeing drawings of naked men and women, learning how to put on a condom, and reading about how scientists are ""working hard"" to make the abortion pill available to the general public. This book treats abortion very lightly, making it appear to be something not serious that people do casually, not the life-altering and painful decision that it is. If you really want to use this book at all, I would wait at least until your children enter high school."
1,Sick and degrading: Designed for the sexualization of your child,Avoid this book. This book encourages your child to sexually experiment with other children. It is designed to sexualize your preteen. It demonstrates how and encourages masturbation. It encourages homosexual relationships.This books is filled with lewd and explicit sexual content. It contains fully detailed pictures of couples in sexual intercourse. There are about 50 total nude pictures in a 87 page book. This book should be classified as pornography.
1,Not age appropriate. Shocking.,I purchased this for my 11 year old son. I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it. The pictures are hand drawn but graphic. Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers. I would be upset to find this in a school library. This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old.
1,Porno for Kids,"I checked out this book for my 17 year old son who was writing a paper on puberty. Most of the text content is great but the pictures are pornographic cartoons. I also have an 11 year old son and was planning on letting him read it. Once I reviewed it, it went straight into my car to be returned to the library. As far as the text goes, most of it was pretty informative and well written for the preteen age group but there were also plenty of references (with lots of pictures) of masturbation, homosexuality, etc. that were way too graphic for anyone under the age of 16 years. Fair warning here: don't buy it for any innocent kids especially ones that don't know anything at all!"
5,What kids need to know.,"""It's Perfectly Normal"" is an excellent sex education guide for older kidsand teenagers. It describes sex and sexuality frankly both in text and inwell-done cartoons. Only the most prudish would be offended by this book."
1,Sick,"All I can say is shame on you for rushing our children into areas they are not emotionally ready for. Obvious to me that the author has never seen the ""normal"" effects of a teenager who had an abortion. The internal struggle and depression that ""normally"" follows. Where are your cartoon pictures of that? Where are the cartoon representations of the child's spirit that is dying while they seek out the ""normal"" pleasures this book proscribes. America wake up!"
1,Very shocked,"While I agree that the things discussed in this book are important to teach your children I strongly disagree with the graphic nature of the illustrations and some of the content in this book. I have also read that some organizations like Planned Parenthood are pushing this book to be placed in grade school libraries. If this is true I as a parent of a pre-school daughter am OUTRAGED that our public schools are allowing this. I don't believe this is appropriate material for children that young. This is borderline pornography. I also believe parents should be the one to share this information with their children not some teacher with a slanted bias toward some of the content in the book, ie..homosexuality, abortion, how to use a condom, etc. Parents should go to their schools and see if this is happening and voice their opinions."
1,This book is disgusting,"I ordered this from a book club, so I was unable to thumb through it. Had I been, I would not have boughten it! When I was age 10 (heck 17 for that matter), I didn't know what it looked like for two people to have sex or what a man's naked organs look like. I turend out okay. I was a virgin until age 18 and by then I learned enough in high school health class to know about birth control etc.. I agree with what others have said that this is a how-to guide and the pictures are way too graphic for a kid. I also don't see whats wrong with letting our kids be kids a little longer. Do they really need to see this at such a young age. Also, I am against abortion and homosexuality, which this book does nothing but promote!"
2,"Serious Subject, Silly Book","Bought this and was very disappointed: the cartoons and illustrations are just plain silly. Some serious content is covered in this book and the accompanying illustrations seem out of place. If a child needs images like that to feel comfortable with the book's subject matter, then they're not ready for reading about it. And if they are mature enough, the images aren't. ""What's Happening to my Body, for Boys"" does it better, where it is handled respectfully and maturely."
3,A middle schoolers piont of veiw,"I have to say I haven't completely read this book, but I stumbled across it while doing some research at my school library. Personally, I think it's great that this book is so open...sex shouldn't be hidden away in the closet. In this day and age, it's important to talk about sex, and books like this are helpful. Many kids my age have sexual encounters, but still don't know all the basics. I live in an international community, and some parents leave their children in the dark. Further more, no matter how well a parent educates their child, there are ALWAYS questions, trust me. It's good for anyone, to be able to get answers, because talking about sex with your parents is very rarely comfortable. However, a lot of the illustrations in this book disturbed me. I know at my age it's not nessary to be embarresed, but some of the pictures were...too detailed...too graphic. It's great to be open about sex and love....just make sure it doesn't go too far."
5,Answers the Question you never wanted them to ask!,"This book is full of information for both boys and girls and while my sons chuckled when I first gave it to them the book is well worn and they have answers to the questions I never wanted them to ask. I dont recommend it for children under the age of 10 or you will wind up with more question than answers. Some of the drawings were a bit much but truthful. Overall I think all ""tweens"" would benifit from this book. It is straight to the point and answers question they might not want to ask an adult or that an adult might not want to answer."
4,A different slant on 18th century warship action and life at sea and in England and the continent.,An entertaining read. Well developed characters and enough mystery to keep up your interest. I will look forward to his next book.
2,Hard Hat and Legs VHS,"This item was described as ""Very Good"". No mention was made that it had been from a video rental business. If that HAD been mentioned, I would not have ordered it. In short, the sellers use of ""Very Good"" is in my opinion a gross distortion of the truth. The Video has a lot of hash at times and the picture jumps and waves. It is a good thing that it was not very costly, but I strongly disagree with its representation as ""Very Good"". My criticism is not of the movie, which I enjoyed in spite of the condition of it, but of the vendor and its misleading description."
2,It Sucks,"After reading the reviews here, I bought this album. After discovering that the disc itself is unplayable on an Apple computer (some sort of rubbish copy protection in the disc) I managed to hear it on a car stereo. Apart from 2 really good songs, this album is dated and awful. Instead of sticking to the Heaven 17 sound, they have tried to emulate every crappy house/dance style of that 1996/1997 era. It sounds like a cheap rubbish Corona album or something of that ilk. Oh dear, I'm VERY disappointed. The thing about these 80's bands who were pioneers once, is that they no longer are the trend setters or the ground breakers. They are mearly emulating old garbage."
3,Utilitarian,"Bought this for my daughter to use at college to make boxed mac and cheese . It just barely holds a whole box ..but it works. It's an inexpensive tool. Gets the job done. It's cheap and if my daughter happens to break or lose it, no great loss. Worth the price? Yeah, I think so."
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!,"I am not kidding here! You can get this exact same movie - PLUS 2 others (Thank Your Lucky Stars, & This is the Army) for LESS than half the price of this dvd! That's right....a 3 dvd box set for about $15.00 (I got mine new from an Amazon dealer for less than $12.00!). And I'm not talking about a cheap bootleg knockoff - this boxset is the STUDIO ORIGINALS from Warner Brothers. Plus it has the best picture quality because it's the latest edition(2008). Just search for ""Homefront Collection"" in the Amazon movie section. It is listed as ""Homefront Collection (Irving Berlin's This Is The Army/Thank Your Lucky Stars/Hollywood Canteen). I really hope this review will save you a LOT of cash! By the way, the 1-star rating is for the price of this item, NOT the quality...this film is a real gem!!"
2,on a clear day,"I dont like this book it is too boring! I couldnt get interested.The introduction was just extremly boring, it had nothing that really interested me to keep reading."
2,Abel goes tribal...over and over and over and over and over...,"I was let down by this collection, which is your typical, repetitive tribal beats, for the most part. Not much in the way of peak hour anthems here at all. Donna Blakely pretty much has all the burden put in her with the track Celebrate, which is near the end of the CD. Just not enough power house here. Track times:1. the intro (2:04)2. Bang the drum (7:46)3. The door (8:41)4. Rain (5:56)5. do u luv me (5:57)6. Standing (5:08)7. who am I (6:48)8. Mescalito (7:09)9. celebrate (8:32)10. Celbrando el carnaval (6:20)11. Me interesa (5:08)"
2,A let down considering Abel's earlier B-sides rock so hard,"I have tracked Abel for the past six years, through his earlier works in the Chzech underground to the slamming tracks he lays down at Club Fun, this album was kind of a let down. In his earlier works he showed such drive and determination, if you can find them try ""Slam the Bass"", ""Rock the Guitar"", or ""I Love You Like Crumbcakes"" some earlier treats where Abel truly began to spread his musical wings. I think that the criticism about Abel ""selling out"" may have a little truth to it, lately he has been wearing flashy gold medallions and rings, I also heard he was considering doing a duet with Billy Joel. ""Whats up wit dat?""In the end Bang the Drum is still a solid little number, Abel manages to stay two steps ahead of the competition, but he really needs to pick up the pace."
3,Not quite like hearing Abel live,"Nothing compares to hearing Abel live. He was great at the White Party and I look forward to hearing him in Orlando. The CD does not compare, and I liked Circuit Sessions 2 better."
1,Undisclosed problem,I bought this bulb to use with an old (over 15 years)Torchiere Floor Lamp that used a 500 watt halogen bulb. This bulb cannot be used indoors according to Sylvania. I did not try to use it because of the fire danger with these lamps (they no longer make ones that use 500 watt bulbs). I would not have purchased it if it had been clear that they cannot be used in these old lamps.
1,Bought at the hardware store around the corner.,"My bulb was flickering after 20 years of heavy use, and would only stay lit for 30 seconds, so I needed a replacement fast. I looked at Azn and found everything was going for 6$ or more shipped in a couple of days. I went to the hardware store around the corner and picked up a Westinghouse Halogen J-Type Double Ended 500W bulb for 3$ and it works perfectly. My lamp says use 500W bulb to prevent fire hazard. So I did. Many of the bulbs at Azn are only 300W. Good luck! Years ago I had one of these torchere lamps go aflame at the bulb. Fortunately, I saw it instantly - cut off the electricity swiftly, and the flame died that moment. It was a miracle? Probably, given what the light was shining on at the time! But that is another story. Nothing lights up a room like these, but they have the potential to be dangerous."
4,Like the Sisters of Mercy but more upbeat,"Once again a legendary British gothic rock band that has been forgotten in this age of decadence in which people think the term gothic means anger rather than misery. Forget what the pop music and shock rock industry tell you is gothic, this is the real thing. It's beautiful and poetic by conveying a feeling of darkness and hopelessness. This music is groovy with medieval undertones! If you're like me and think the Sisters of Mercy are good but need to have recorded a bit more fast paced music in their time then you will love this. Snake Dance is a classic song. By the way for those of you who like gothic style music and are new to the scene also check out The Cure, Joy Division, and March Violet fans, Children on Stun (all great British bands who wrote or still write meaningful and emotional music)."
4,"It's great, if you've never heard the ""Electric Shades"" album.","If you've never heard the March Violets' album ""Electric Shades"", then ""Botanic Verses"" is great CD. However, if you have heard ""Electric Shades"", you're probably going to be a bit disappointed with ""Botanic Verses"". They should have included all the tracks from Electric Shades and filled in with other tracks after that."
5,BEHRINGER PX1000 ULTRAPATCH,I Like That Each Channel Can Be Aligned In 5 Different Modes !!! With Lowest Price...
2,Nice looking gadget but awful sound,"I bought this as a replacement for my other voice recorder that I lost in school. The sound quality is very inferior compared to my old Olympus. It is advertised as stereo but there is only one mic input. So, what you hear in your left ear is the same as in your right, no stereo imagery. Plus, Sony's DVF file sucks. You can only play it on the Windows Media Player, but only if you downloaded the included plug-in. My old Olympus's output are WMA files. So everywhere I go, I can use any PC with Windows Media Player to listen to my files."
3,Good but not great,"There are some really fun songs on here, but a lot of what seems to be filler material. Nothing outstanding, which is a shame."
5,Captured the High Energy and Excitement of an AWESOME Show!,"I've been listing to this CD for months now and it only gets better with time, you never get tired of hearing it. There is alot more energy in the songs live then their studio versions and you get all the Big Hits on here with a very touching remake of ""April 24th 1981 and my father's chair""< ( worth the price of the CD right there!). I can't wait to go out and get the street version of this CD! that's how GREAT this CD is you have to grab all the versions you can of it.So if you have been to any of the Rick Springfield concerts (past or present) or just a fan of his music don't EVEN think about getting around to buying this CD...JUST DO IT!! YOU'LL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS CD!!"
5,Rick Still Has It!,"Back in 2000, I saw Rick in concert for the first time. Based on that performance, I made sure to purchase the Greatest Hits Alive as soon as it came out. In fact, I purchased one of the limited edition sets, numbered and with his autograph on it before they were released to the public. All I can say is...Rick Rocks live! And this CD shows that. All the old favorites are here, but turned up just a notch, Rick style. Rick has such amazing energy and puts his all into his music and live shows. This is definately a must have for true Rick fans."
4,Rick Springfield,Another good show saw Rick back in 1983 and he still has it what is it with these reviews 7 more words
5,This is the CD you have been waiting for!,"Extraordinary CD - I bought the Lmtd Edition Collector CD and was blown away by the Live performance format. This is Rick Springfield at his BEST! A blend of old and new material that is certain to Satisfy!!! Of course I ordered the Street Version without hesitation ... with New songs added, it is essential gear for the old and new fan alike!"
5,"Relive your concert, and your youth!","If you have ever attended a Rick Springfield concert, or wish that you have , you must get this CD. I have two copies. One was a hand signed copy from Rick's web site and the copy from Amazon. You will turn it up ,I promise. I love the song Gloria. My kids all sing with the CD in the car. I have been a Rick Springfield fan for a very long time but this album is the BEST.Listen to it once and you will be hooked. I know I will have to buy another copy because I play it so much. Listen for Gloria on the radio. I heard it was going to be released for the radio."
3,Ok but,"The pouch is too shallow and the pillow cannot fit in perfectly, still with some exposing outside. Have no idea whether the one I got is a defective one. Used several Samsonite travel pillow before but all in gray and all good. Wondering if this is someing different between gray and charcoal grey ones."
5,Great read.,This book really puts you right up front on the rollercoaster ride of Cory Lords' life. It's easy to engross yourself in the ups and downs of the character's ordeals and there's never a dull moment. Throughout the pages you get to see glimpses of the author that makes this a personal and simply delightful book.
4,A decent starter guitar,"I picked this up to use as a practice/travel guitar. It has a good sound and is a handsome instrument. The softcase included is nothing terribly special, but it's adequate.On the minus side, the first minor issue is that the included cable is kind of flimsy.The more annoying issue is that two of the tuners won't hold an adjustment well. It's not quite bad enough for me to return it. I'm contemplating replacing the tuners myself with better ones, but I haven't decided yet.Pros:*Good quality guitar*Excellent condition - no scratches or dings*Soft case is niceCons:*Tuner knobs could be a better quality*Included cable is cheesy"
1,Definetly not a classic,"The book rambled on a lot. He kept going off the subject, it became very annoying. Salinger also kept repeating himself. The writing was very simple, a twelve year old could have written this book. Do not bother reading this unless you enjoy falling asleep!"
2,ASA rail isn't standard,"Overall, a decent drop for the price. pretty sturdy (not the best, but you are buying a cheap one anyway), however, it has an ASA rail to attach your ASA- but its not standard 3/8"" dovetail. i dont know what size it is, but i couldn't attach my ASA to it. since i have no idea what size it is and i refuse to spend more money on an ASA that might not even fit, I've wasted my money. Also, if you do manage to have/get an ASA that fits this thing, one of the friction screws to hod the ASA in place is underneath a flame- unreachable with a normal allen key. Dont buy this product unless youre absolutely sure you will be able to use it."
5,"This is it for your home theater, look no futher.","The Five Star could be 10 GOLD STARS, because you just hit pay dirt. I have invested in every lighting system out there trying to do it cheaper. I got them all right here in my storeroom. (X10,Dayton,GE, etc.) Name it, and I can show you over $100 investment in about 3 different kind of lighting system. Save your money and go with the Monster Cable System. Programing is as easy as 1,2,3. ""Yes this is it"". 1 botton and 7 different lights are doing 7 different setting.

Can't beat it. you understand what I'm talking about. Don't waste your money trying to do it cheaper, just look at the $425.00 I've got tied up in trying to do it cheap."
1,don't buy a blue ant,"This product works poorly! It gets ""dropped"" by my phone constantly. I called & emailed the company - no one ever returned either my call or email."
1,authentic french fashions of the twenties,How can you messure disappointment in stars? I found this book resembled my childs colouring book & felt it should have come with a box of crayons. Not one 'proper' photo. I flipped through it & returned it almost immediately. Very disappointed.
1,Not what it seems.............,While the software ad says it is for beginners.....this is not. A beginner needs reviews of the letters of the alpabet itself. This software however plunges straight into conversational hebrew. Hebrew is a languare that does not have an english alphabet. The hebrew language is made from symbols. The software does not review the letters at all.
5,Best Chinese is at home with this product,This is the easiest homemade chinese you will ever make and the best. I dredge the meat in additional cornstart before frying to make it crispy. Always get rave reviews.
4,My 3 Year-Old Loves This CD,"My daughter wants this CD played daily! She enjoys singing along with the few vocal songs.Many of the pieces are instrumental used in the background of the movie. The songs with vocals are straight from the film as well. ""Cinderella"" doesn't stand on its own apart from the movie the way ""Beauty and the Beast"" does. However, it is a worthwhile addition to ones Disney collection."
2,Not a masterpiece,"when you are a child, you need communication. Words are a key ingredient to a childs growth. This record doesn't portrait the real heartfelt disney i know, and grew up with. I would not recomend this compact disc to any other people. Overall, I would say this record needs work, it doesnt show the real disney that the movie shows. Don't let me influence you, buy it, and find out for yourself."
3,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 18 made it to 15%, 10 more at 25% and 2 extended to 30%.The 3D of the computer generated animations are fairly consistent from scene to scene. I was pleasantly surprised that unlike most `originally ... IMAX' films, the 3D in this movie is NOT riddled with spurts of excessive parallax. However I did experience slight eye fatigue from this title. Not great 3D, not bad 3D.*** 3 star ***MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
5,IMAX - Sea Rex (Blu Ray 3D),"I like 3D movies and I like documentaries. If you like them as well, then I highly recommend this DVD and know that you will not be disappointed. Amazon.com is a wonderful way to expand your 3D DVD collection. I am always impressed with the speed and accuracy of my purchases through Amazon. Try it yourself - you'll love the experience."
4,Sea Rex,This is a very good educational dvd. The 3d Version has interesting special affects. This will suit all ages. Good job.
5,Never any problems!,"I got this card when I bought a camera (came with it). I've never had any problems! Had it for seven years. Always uploads fast, no errors. Very happy!"
1,The Devils dandruff,The best advice I can give you is to try and find another book on the topic of cocaine this book is so slow so un entertaining and just utterly useless it is not worth the purchase price but having spent the money I forced myself to read it I think the person who wrote the book might have done a few lines when he was writing it and convinced himself that it was very interesting respectfully Johnny Irish
5,Best product ever to revive old rubber seals and joints.,"Used this on my 100k plus nissan as preventive maintenance. I sprayed it on all rubber joints and seals in the car. this does wonders to the old dried out rubber and the rubber becomes soft and almost as good as new. the spray took out all the squeaks in the car suspension. It works when you might have old seals and rubber joints and bushings, if some seals are already broken nothing will help. i would recommend it for preventive maintenance every 50k or less for higher mileage cars. I also used it in the engine and transmission before any leaks appeared hopefully it will work its wonders in the seals. excellent product"
1,DOES NOT WORK,Very disappointed in this product. Followed the instructions and it didn't even fix the tiny leak I had. Not worth the money I spent on it.
1,205,I put it into 2 cars and didn't stop the leak at all. Don't waste your money!ATP AT-205 Re-Seal Stops Leaks
2,Doesn't work,"I have 97 Honda Civic DX leaking oil around clutch housing and engine. Mechanic say it's rear main seal leak. Watch video on scottykillmer.com and get to knowATP AT-205 Re-Seal Stops Leaks. I bought it at local XL parts store,tried it a couple of times, leak doesn't stop.fortunately I need to do clutch replacement for my car, so I just get rear main seal replaced free.This product doesn't work for me !!!"
4,Beats Engine Tear Down,"I gave this product a 4 star because it actually works, my engine takes 8 qtz of motor oil, when I read the back of the bottle product it informed you of how much to use with a given amount of oil. I did not want to wait and order another bottle of this product.......to my pleasant surprise even though the ratio of motor oil to AT-205 was not as instructed the product took a little longer but has stopped my leakage. I added AT-205 upon completing my own oil change"
1,Worth a try,I tried ATP AT-205 Re-Seal for rear axel leaks. It did not work actually made the leaks worse. If it helped it would have posponed the needed repair. O well off with the axels.
5,AT-205,Have used AT-205 on numerous problems since first purchasing this item. Was advised to give it a try by an old diesel mechanic. First time use was in a 1973 Chevrolet Monte Carlo trans. Car could be left in drive for 1/2 hour before engaging drive. Put in the product and the next morning did my normal thing. Transmission immediately engaged and I almost went through the garage door. Have since used this product for numerous applications and have been mostly successful.
2,gasket sealer,Probably works for some but did not work for me. How ever my problem happened to be a metal gasket.
4,worked for my auto transmission,"My 85 VW vanagon had multiple steady drips from the automatic transmission. I was quoted $800 for a transmission reseal and simply could not afford it at the time as I was in midst of a move from Hawaii to the northwest...the van would be shipped too. I figured I might buy some time before having to do the reseal. Well to my amazement, it stopped all the drips. I know that most mechanics frown on the use of re-sealers but all I can say is that it worked for me. I've probable driven about 3000 miles since putting it in and still no leaking. To further insult mechanical purists, I decided to try it in the vanagon's crankcase as it has always had a steady oil drip from rear of the motor. Well, it has significantly slowed the drip. It has not stopped it yet but I only added it about 100 miles ago. I say, give it a try."
1,Sealer,"I used this product in my daughters Honda Accord according to instructions with no change ,and it in fact seems to be leaking worse than before . I am going to be heading to a 2nd mechanic shortly . I can't seem to get any closure on this leak ."
1,don't work on main seal,I pour the 205 in the morning let it run 4 hour. After 4 hour is still leak.i have bad luck trying everything in the market just thinking it would work. may be work on transmission but not on engine.to solve the problem just do it the right way first time and fix it right.take it from someone who buy everything on the market.this was last product i will ever buy.
1,disappointed by product.,"I bought this product after watching the advertisement on the internet. At first, it seemed to slow down the leaks, however after a few days the engine leaks were back."
3,Not A Miracle Fix,"My 1996 Acura RL was leaking from both the front cam seals and the rear main seal. ATP Reseal worked to diminish the leaks, but did not stop them. The front seals seem to have benefited the most from the product, as it is barely leaking now, however the rear main has seen only a marginal benefit."
1,Don't use it!,"The rubber seal of the rack-n-pinion of my car ended up ripped. That turned a small leaking hassle (refill once a week) into an unstoppable drip, rendering the power steering unusable! So, let old dogs lie - or fix it the right way!"
5,why doenst every store carry this miracle product.,I cant get this anywhere but amazon and it seems to be the cheapest source too. This is one of the most amazing things I have seen. I had a problem with my trans slipping when it was cold... HAD... it was fixed the next day. I need more of this I will use it on everything (except breaks)
1,A major disappointment,"I read Carol Smith's first book, Circle of Friends, and thought her second would be even better. I was sadly disappointed. A murder mystery that is dull and does not even have a murder until over half way through the book is hard to trudge through at best. The plot was thin, the characters weak and tiring. I found myself irritated for even finishing the book. If she tries this again I hope she learns from this major mistake."
5,another,"I believe William Walker's account of his adventures in Nicaragua demonstrate lucid thinking, an ability to enthrall a reader and a defininite articulacy."
1,"The received package does not match the picture - I did not get all the inserts, but the model number is the same","The knobs did not fit my range -- the holes are too big and they are too tall.I had to stuck pieces of paper into holes so that they would fit. However, one needs to push the knob in order to turn it from the initial position on a gas range. So I had to cut parts of the knobs - they were too tall.I could have done the same with the cheaper knobs."
4,"Excellent mix of blues, country & rock music. Bluesy Rockabilly!","A lot of big names here backing up the voice, guitar and pen of The Tractors' past albums. If you like music with a solid beat that makes you smile and feel good, this is worth the bucks. It's ""The Sound of The Tractors!"""
4,More of the same!!,"The boys are back with more of the same ""good times"" music. My favorites are NINE ELEVEN, CAN'T GET NOWHERE, BABALOU and DON'T EVER TAKE MY PICTURE DOWN. If you're a fan then check out FAST GIRL."
3,good -- but not great,"My overall reaction to this cd is a little disappointment. There's no bad music here -- all good solid tracks that will be good ""driving"" music. Whats missing is a great track like Baby Likes to Rock It or the Tulsa Shuffle. Fast Girl is probably the best track, but only a notch above the others. I'd hoped for more."
3,Disappointing,"After really enjoying their first two albums (the Christmas album doesn't count), I found this quite disappointing. My advice to the Tractors would be to listen again to ""Baby Likes to Rock It"" and try to recapture the magic that made them something special. This album doesn't have it--the magic, I mean."
5,"No ""Boogie Woogie..Train"" - but a lot of fun","The Tractors self titled ""The Tractors"" CD is one of my all time favorite CDs. I don't think this CD has any songs that are as good as ""Boogie Woogie Choo-Choo Train"" or ""The Tulsa Shuffle"" from that other CD, but it is a consistently fun, upbeat, excellent CD from start to finish. There isn't one bad song on this CD.If your buying your first Tractors CD, buy ""The Tractors"" instead. But, if you already own and love ""The Tractors"", then buy this one too. You'll be bopping along from start to finish."
3,Beginner's Norwegian,This CD-ROM provides an interactive format in which to begin to learn Norwegian with the help of your computer. The instruction is pitched at the absolute beginners level and covers some basic vocabulary and useful phases. The instruction typically links a Norwegian word or phrase with its pronounciation in Norwegian and with an English translation. Pictures and graphics are provided to reinforce the word or phrase. The various segments of instruction include quizes to test comprehension. The format is likely to be very user-friendly for children; adults may outrun the instruction fairly quickly.This product is likely to be most useful for those with no background at all in the Norwegian language.
4,Everything you want in Joao,"An excellent intimate CD that is happy and mellow. Many if not all original songs here, none of the same familiar Bossa Nova songs redone again. The recording is just as good as other much more expensive Bossa Nova CD's purchased in the past. The best song here (only in my humble opinion) is the last song which is a Brazilian version of Klang Klang Klang went ""the trolley"", very inventive and clever. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because I don't have all the other Joao CD's (yet). Goodbye Jobim hello Joao!"
2,microhydro - Clean Power from Water,"Not the best book I've read about Microhydro. I read one published in the 70's and it did a much better job explaining how electricity works and the problems associated with making power from water. Through out microhydro he make references to other parts of the book, it was kind of like teasers when you are watching bad tv, ""in just a moment we'll find out what's in Al Capone's secret vault"". It was like he didn't have enough to say so he kept stretching it out and repeating things he already said. He also kept talking about the case studies at the end of the book. They were not too informative. All and all I just wanted to let people know I was disappointed. This was supposed to be The Book on microhydro and it just didn't measure up . I more recently read a catch all book for wind, water and solar energy and it did a great job. I would recommend ""[[ASIN: Power with Nature Second Edition: Alternative Energy Solutions for Homeowners Updated]]"""
2,Disappointed,"This really is not the best book on microhydro. An earlier review by Sam C. sums it up nicely. Thoughout the book, the author keeps referring to the case studies, but they're at the back of the book. So do you read the end of the book first? He stretches out simple or obvious points and keeps repeating how microhydro gives more bang-for-the-buck than solar. Some sections were not helpful at all: i.e. I wanted concrete examples of how to control debris. His statement on that is: ""See what other people in your neighborhood do to solve this problem."" (p.87) Or what about hydroscreens, or other examples of intakes? Nothing... This book was somewhat basic and I was looking for something a little more technical. I'm disappointed. I learned more in the <25 pages on this topic in ""The Renewable Energy Handbook"" (by Kemp) than this whole book."
1,Showcase of Microhydro instalations,"This book is a colection of small to tiny hidropower instalations mainly in Canada and gives general details about how the power is generated for isolated houses or cabins.Does not give you ways to learn how to solve your specific situation, simply is a description of different solutions that can be of general model if you have a similar situation on hand.If you are looking on how to build a microhydro there are other books that are more suited to the task, if you just want to learn how people have solved their energy problem with hydro generation then you will find it useful."
5,Amazing book,Scott Davis does a wonderful job at explaining every aspect of microhydro. I highly recommend this for teaching or personal use if you are interested in building your own system.
2,too small,I am no so really happy with this and i recommened this to anyone who like this type of thing.
3,Marching music,"Okay, I didn't really like this one. I wanted music to walk to and this one just didn't do it for me."
5,Better Than the Marines!,"Aside from the recording itself, which is impeccable, this US Army Band, is a marvel. The instruments from the piccolos to the tubas are played with precision, clarity and with a dynamic range and musicianship that testifies to the quality of the director and his appreciation of band music. IMO they clearly have replaced the US Marine Corps Band as the military's premier musical organization."
4,THE REEL CIVIL WAR!,"Mr.Chadwick attemps to prove that most American films dealing with the ""war between the States"",were neutral,or actually pro-Southern,in their views.He proves it to me just by his writing on that great classic,""Gone with the Wind""which is unabashedly pro-Confederate.The major Hollywood studios took this course of action for purely ecomonic reasons. Take a hard line,against the South,and your film will not get booked,south of the Mason- Dixon line,and many other places too.The motion picture industry is in the profit making business,NOT TO PREACH.He writes well of the anti-lynching classic,""The Ox-Bow Incident"" but notes its mixed reviews,even in the ""liberal"" North.""A very srange Western"",one critic called and so it was,but a great and powerful film.(see my review).Mr.Chadwick makes a few errors,such as calling the Hank Worden character in ""The Searchers)(old Mose) a black cowboy,the character is an American Indian.3 1/2 stars is a better rating."
1,Save your Money,"An obvious and intentional attack on all things Southern. Mr. Chadwick should be ashamed of himself. As an historian, myself, Mr. Chadwick is more wrong than he will ever know or, at least, will admit."
1,These actually didn't last as long as the standard GE bulbs,"From my pack of 4, two seem to be working just fine but one gave out in less that two months and 1 was a dud (didn't work at all) right out of the package."
3,"Good, but not ""Here come the Horns""","Don't take it from my 3 star rating that this is a duff album - far from it, it's bangin'. However, if you have never heard any Delinquentes, buy ""Here come the Horns"" first, this second and their eponymously titled 1st album last. HCTH is one of the best hip-hop albums ever released."
5,"Latin, shmatin, this CD is for all colors.","Finally, a CD that keeps me from touching the forward button on the freeway. There are at least 3 songs on this CD that should be getting some massive radio air play. I am a fan of all types of music, but if this is Hip Hop. Then Hip Hop is my favorite music. The beats are awesome on every song & the lyrics are moving & believable. My favorite song is ""House of the Rising Drum"" the beats behind the strong & thought provoking lyrics are almost hypnotic. You better have your seat belt on during this classic, psychedelic song. Again, I can't emphasize enough how good it feels to buy a CD that gives me my money's worth from start to finish. This CD has a song called ""Feel Good"" and that's what this CD will make you feel. Buy It!"
1,Disappointed,"This does not seem to be an extract to me. I consider an extract to be in liquid form only, but this liquid has a lot of fine particles in it as if the hops was boiled in water and strained through a leaky strainer. The particles are dense enough to clog the eyedropper. In addition, this is not a standardized product. So, it's difficult to determine how effective it is or should be. I've tried it several times before bedtime to help make me drowsy, but I've not noticed any effect. Next time I'll look for a standardized product meaning one that contains a specific percentage of active ingredients."
5,Saves my sanity!,"I use this product to end the heat cycle of my breeding female European Burmese. She is a very vocal cat and when she is in season there is no sleep, for her or me! With this product it reduces a two week heat cycle to three days making life for her and me more enjoyable. I love this product!"
3,"Keeps cuticles very moisturized, but it's ""greasy""","First off, love the scent! Also love the exfoliation I get. However, the word ""creme"" is not quite accurate... a creme should rub in completely, and this does not. I use it at night, and end up rubbing it into my hands so as not to get ""grease"" all over my sheets. Would use it more often if it would rub in better!"
5,hands without cracks,"During the winter I always get ""cracks"" around my nails, not only painful but ugly. I started using the cuticle creme and haven't had a ""crack"" since. It has become my nightly routine. Thank you Burt's Bees."
3,Not Too Bad On Less Damaged Cuticles,"This is pretty good is your cuticles aren't too bad off . On my hands where the dryness isn't half as bad this product is great. On my toes where I have worse cuticles and dried up areas around the toe nail, this product doesn't work half as good. I have to use something much stronger such as Kerasal even on the nails and cuticles, it works much better."
5,Absolutely AMAZING,"I recieved the cuticle creme in a pack for Christmas... and well. It's my favorite thing out of the entire ""healthy hands"" kit.I was a ritual nail biter since childhood, and now being 21 I have a reason to not bite them.I'm not suggesting this will work for everyone to deter nail biting, but I found that by taking the time to take care of my nails that I didn't want to ruin them by biting them any longer.I always had the bad cuticles and my nails were just overall gross... but now they're growing out nicely. My cuticles aren't frayed and my nails are shinier than they've ever been. They're actually so nice that I don't even want to polish them. It sort of looks like there is a 'clear coat' on yours nails after using this product from the very first day. After a while using them you actually feel your nail get smoother...AWESOME product."
1,Not enough moisture to solve Colorado Hands.,"I used to buy this and use it without lucky. Seems like when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn't rich enough. I could put it on 3-5 times a day and it didn't help. I switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called Bee Nuts and have had great luck with it."
5,No chalky nails!,"I use this every time after I wash the dishes. Not only does it leave my nails feeling healthy and my fingers soft, I would use it just for its scent alone. It has a very pleasant lemon fragrance that reminds me a sweet lemon tart. I almost want to lick my fingers!"
5,i love it,this is a good product. Makes my nails feel great and they feel alot healthier. I loe burts bees! yay
5,Outstanding Product!,"This stuff is fantastic! I have used everything under the sun for my cracking skin near my nails, and nothing works like this! In fact, nothing else kept the skin from cracking, period! I also like Burt's Bees hand salve, which I buy regularly, now, too. I highly recommend this. I use it at night. I put the hand salve on first. Then, I put the cuticle cream on my fingertips only. I wear gloves to protect my sheets. I reapply once or twice in the night. I don't think my skin will crack anymore, because of this. It was quite painful before, too, when it did."
1,Cosmic Energy: The Charlatan's Power,Like all her other poorly written books (self published by drones in her cult) this one promises all and delivers nothing--except a one-way ticket to her cult where you can spend upwards of $3000 learning what Flora herself claims you already possess.
3,Informative but Poorly Written,"The book is full of great information but, unfortunately, is written poorly. The rhythms are written in a confusing fashion. My tap teacher, who has edited previous editions of this text, was scandalized when she saw this revised edition."
1,Yuck!,"I love all of the other Serrated Edge books, but this one is a definate flop. It featured a young boy being slowly starved and tortured to death by a Koreshian/NeoNazi cult. That made me sick. Most of the characters were very flat also. In short, a dull, depressing book."
3,"Not heavy fare, but worth a read","I found this book to be an entertaining example of its kind, and worth reading, especially if you are a Lackey fan. I did, however, find fault with some of the character developement. While the cases of Joe and especially Cindy are poignant, many of the other characters are less multi-faceted than one would expect. Good and evil are absolutes, with little room to explore the gray area of the different characters' consciences. However, these faults are far from dire, and I would not want to discourage a potential reader from enjoying this book for what it is; a side trip, as opposed to a journey, through an imaginary landscape."
4,Elves are jolly grand fun!,"Mercedes Lackey handles elves like no one else. She's always fun and entertaining. The SERRAted edge books are some of my favorites (though the first one was slightly inferior). Wheels of Fire is anothe prime crazy-elves book--but it was unfinished. Though one of the character's lives is traced into Chrome Circle, which I actually read before this one, the rest seem to be dropped. I expect a sequel. It's always a sequel...but all the character build up led to a disappointing flop in the end. I wanted to see more from Cindy, more from Jamie, more from Bob, more from Al, more from Frank, more from Joe! The ending felt hurried, as if Misty was on a tight deadline and realized it a chapter away from the book's conclusion. The only character I was even partially satisfied with in the end was Sarah, a ghost.So, I would say that this book is good, and definitely worth a read (or five), but not Lackey's best, and requires a sequel."
5,pokemon the mysteriuos mew,THIS BOOK IS TOTALY COOL. I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT SHOWS LOT'S OF POKEMON PICTURES. I RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL THE POKEMON FANS
3,Not an Original,"Well, I was disappointed! I expected to hear the original Orquesta Aragón and I ended up listening to a mediocre imitation that uses its original arragements but lacks the mastery of the flute and violins that made Aragón famous. The songs aren't bad; they can't be, afterall they are the original arrangements. But the performances don't have the heart that the original group shared with its fans. Too bad. Seems to me that without the original musicians to guide the newer orchestra members, the new Aragón is just so-so. I often wondered why the Cuban youth of today isn't as taken with the Aragón as my generation once was. Now I know."
3,heavy-speed-industrial-metal,"side project from Larsen (LEATHER STRIP). I think this cd is one of the heavies and speedest industrial-metal recors in the world among BILE, STRAPPING YOUNG LAD, FEAR FACTORY... But, Klute seems to be more danceable and can be easily compared to the crossover of PSYCHOPOMPS(Both are at Zoth Ommong). Excluded isn't an essential record but representes an important step of heavy industrial music. The last track ""tequila slammer"" is a funny cover."
3,For Industrial-Metal Fans Only,An assault of harsh keyboard and sampled guitar. Very different form Claus' Leaether Strip work as the softer interludes not present. As harsh as Fear Factory or Skrew but keyboard not guitar based. Overall a good solid work without much to stand out Leaether Strip fans know he is cabable(sp?) of more than this.
4,Better later than never!,"The signs look great...1 day later than stated, but no problem...they arrived, so thank you for sending some great looking and very professional looking signs!"
2,This was an alright CD.,"Well,...what can I say? I've heard this CD over and over, I can't shrug the feeling that there was some mistakes made and not corrected. Either thats the way it's suppose to be or something went wrong. But as for the music...... it was ok......but could have been better if more effort was put in to this project! But on the other hand, it was ok."
2,Not as good as ketchum's earlier works,"One of the things I have enjoyed about Ketchum's works is how readable they are and Victory at Yorktown is no exception. That being said,I did not enjoy this work as much as I did his previous works. One reason might be that I read Decisive Day, The Winter Soldiers and Saratoga before I knew much about the Revolutionary war, and I have read a lot of other books since then. I didn't really feel as though I learned anything new in Victory at Yorktown. It gives a brief account of the campaign in the Carolinas and Arnold's treason before delving into Yorktown. The description of the battle, and the Naval engagements prior to, seemed to lack any emotion or excitement. The personal accounts he provides are really the same ones that every other book about the revolution gives. This could be a good book for those reading about the later stages of the war for the first time, however those who are well read on the subject may want to skip it."
3,Entertaining but could be better,"I did enjoy reading Victory at Yorktown. I did think the title of the book was a bit misleading. As other reviewers have pointed out, about one half of the the book deals with the southern campaign. What little time is devoted to the actual Yorktown engagement is broken up by frequent wanderings into other areas, some relevant, others not. I was also a bit disappointed by the very skimpy coverage devoted to the diplomatic dealings going on during the Yorktown battle. The book, entertaining as it was, could really have improved had more attention been given to the surrender negotiations.Even with this criticisms I highly recommend Victory at Yorktown."
5,A Reminder that History Hinges on the Actions of a Few,"The value of this book is not so much in the details of troop maneuvers on the battlefield, but rather the lead-up to this battle. This includes the infighting between British leaders in NY and Virginia; the sorry state of affairs of the American army, the motivations of the French armies and even the great respect they showed for their American counterparts.When the seige itself unfolds within the latter chapters of the book, it is richly described and a fitting conclusion. It is also a reminder that the actions of just a few generals - savvy or otherwise - can change the course of history.Having walked the fields at Yorktown many times, this book filled in all the blanks for me."
4,A miraculous victory,"Yorktown, famous for enabling American independence, is less well known as a narrow escape from bitter defeat. The campaign capped six years of rebellion - years of scarce victories, disappointment, monetary ruin, privation, restive troops, and an unbowed `superpower' enemy fully capable of prolonging stalemate. By 1781 it was `now or never.'French assistance was essential, and Franklin proved an ingenious advocate. Without it (money, arms, troops, ships, expertise), all would have been lost. The need to collaborate in logistics and strategy produced a plan as ambitious (and as likely to fail) as one could imagine.Ketchum's luminous narrative of the campaign is as suspenseful as best-selling fiction.Also recommended:-Brendan Morrissey's 'Yorktown: The World Turned Upside Down' (Ospery)-Barbara Tuchman's `The First Salute'-Ketchum's `Saratoga'-Simon Shama's `Citizens'"
4,Works with modifications,"A little much $ for what it is but does the job well. The design will fit on any ""chain link"" fence as it is adjustable.Bought this to be permanetly mounted to the fence as it is too cumbersome to carry around and too expensive to leave out overnight. Had to drill holes and provide bolts. If they designed it for that and included the hardware, it would have been a five star."
5,Awesome Boots!,I bought these boots for my husband and he mentioned that they are a perfect fit and loves the style.
3,"Great boot for occasions, sloppy construction","Needed a good, conservative dress boot for a black suit of mine for a recent wedding, and got this boot because it was relatively cheap. Was disappointed that some of the stitching was frayed out of the box, and that the left boot had a small brown splotch (only noticeable when looking at the boots close up). That said, it was perfect for the wedding, and I will certainly use these boots for other dressy occasions."
4,deals with societal changes,"As our society becomes more diverse in terms of race/ethnicity and religion, as women gain more power and gays and lesbians become a larger part of the mainstream, we need to find wasy to address these changes. How can we really move foreword if we are not able to discuss these important changes?Future of white men deals with how we all need to come toghether to build a more cohesive society to address our problems and move foreword. The author deals with issues such as diversity questions that people have like when to refer to people's ethnic background and if religous displays at places like work are acceptable or not. It also deals with how to be an ally to groups that need to be represented and the types of names that we need to address differnt groups by."
4,Great job Auralog!,"I love this software, the only reason I did't give it five stars is the lack of being able to print out portions of the grammar explanations and the dictionary very easily in a pdf or word format. All in all I think it is worth the cost."
1,confusing,"This is absolutely NOT for beginners. My kids have had a little German already and were totally confused by this. I have had 2 years and could find my way around it OK. But, I didn't find it very useful. The software is ""impatient"" in the dialogue mode. If you don't respond at the exact right second and exactly the correct pace it can't understand you. The grammar section is silly. It does not coordinate with the lessons. You have to dig around in it trying to find what you're looking for. I could go on and on. I'm very glad I got mine as an overstock. I would be FURIOUS if I paid full price for this. I don't even know if it's worth the $25 I paid."
4,very good for the price,Our son is 3 months old and so far this monitor has performed wonderfully.I see others have complained that there is too much static but I've only noticed that problem if a receiver is near other devices like my cell phone for instance.The monitor is very sensitive which is good and bad. You have to get used to not jumping up over every little sound your baby makes. The light display is very handy. I take the receiver into the bathroom when I'm taking a shower. I can look out and see if the lights are flashing which signals that the baby is crying and I cut my shower short if necessary...another good and bad thing!
4,It works well,"My only complaint is that it emits a buzzing sound constantly, but I've learned to tune it out. And at least I know it's on.It picks up every sound, even the clock ticking across the room! Its range is very good too- I went to the basement with it and it still worked."
1,Monitor quits working!,"We received this monitor for a shower gift. Both receivers quit working after I received a minor electric shock from touching them. Yes, this happened to me from both receivers. I called Graco and they are refunding me for the monitors because there is a year waranty on them. I advise anyone who has these monitors to call Graco and get your money back."
3,mine lasted 4 months,"My monitor worked great for the first 4 months we used it. Like others said, I could even hear my son breathing. Then it stopped working, but the lights were still on, so I had no idea there was a problem until I awoke to my son's screams from down the hall (who knows how long he had been crying before I heard him?) I have tried it a few times since, and it always works for a few minutes before I hear no sounds at all from the receiver. I just tried to give feedback on the Graco website, but the Graco webmaster did not recognize the recipient. I will call them tomorrow, but the website said that the warranty service (available for 1 year) is only available with proof of purchase. I threw away the receipt a long time ago! I think I will have to buy a different monitor."
4,Good buy,I initially had a different monitor on my registry but my mother-in-law got us this one. So far I'm very pleased with it. I can hear everything that goes on in my daughter's room-from her breathing to the raindrops outside.
4,great monitor,This monitor works great! I can hear just about everything. Sometimes to much (like the traffic down the street). I feel confident leaving my son and going to do laundry etc... and knowing if he cries I will hear him. I would definitely buy again if I had to.
1,45 Grave - Debasement Tapes,"This has to be the only bad album put out with 45 Grave's name attached to it. Compiled as an afterthought (post break-up), the disc has very little to offer if you're not a die-hard fan/colletor. The early demos are interesting at best. The live material is recorded poorly, and the in-between song banter is suprisingly pedestrian for such a seasoned band. The ""experimental"" songs are simply random sounds recorded in someone's garage before 45 Grave really came into their own. I still love the band itself, but this disc (DEBASEMENT TAPES) is not a decent representation of them. You'll be better off if you can find a copy of SLEEP IN SAFETY."
2,Lacks any serious content,"Nothing to write home about here. The name of the magazine ""photo technique"" would suggest that there's something new and exciting to learn here. The magazine simply doesn't deliver. It's about 50 pages long, which are filled with fluff and sponsored articles. By fluff I mean rehashed information that's borderline common knowledge. Such as a whole article that talks about how if you increase your shutter speed by one stop, you would want to do the same for your ISO. I've never seen a magazine that had so little to offer. At $30 for six issues it doesn't even come close in value to many great photography books that would teach you 100 times as much for the price of a 1-year subscription."
5,Best bar none for serious photographers,"I've read this magazine for years, as a kid in my grandpa's darkroom, then growing up as it transitioned with the photo world into the digital age. Photo Technique has consistently been the best photo magazine, bar none, if you care about aesthetics, detailed technique, and timelessly beautiful photography. Not necessarily the source for detailed reviews of every single latest camera. Absolutely not a source for breathless articles about faddish imaging filters, etc. Not heavy with ads -- to the contrary, almost every page is worth reading and rereading.If you want a consistently serious, detailed, and incredible place to learn the art and craft of photography, just open the latest issue of Photo Technique."
2,Intellectual babble,"Winnicott's book was difficult for me to get through. With the exception of his case studies, which were somewhat entertaining, it's nothing but monotonous intellectual babble. The title sounds interesting, but the content was not useful to me in the least. There is nothing in this book that would help a typical person to raise an emotionally healthy child. Winnicott is writing for a very select group of people: other psychoanalysts.Nowadays, the majority of people in our society consider Freud to be a joke. While Winnicott does not agree with Freud about everything, he's Freudian enough for me to have trouble taking him seriously. His work seems old and outdated.Winnicott writes his theory in a way which makes it sound complex and important. In actuality, it is extremely simple and could be summed up in a few sentences. I'm not going to say anything else about this book because it is not even worth thinking about or remembering."
3,Boa gaita,"Comprei para experimentar. É uma boa gaita, mas no oferece nada de tao diferente quando comparada a outras. Gostei do estilo e da cor."
4,No longer available,This Cd is no longer available through Amazon. It is only available from the artist Mary Ann Johnston (Saint Ta) at www.maryann-george.com
2,Disappointing,"I had this book for a PhD class in finance and have very few good words to say. The derivations should have been omitted: rarely is anything followed from the beginning to the end; the excerpts that are provided do not give much additional insight. Abundant typos in the formulas. In addition, the context of the models is often poorly presented and I was often left wondering what the situation or some assumptions are. Overall, relatively poorly written.The book does give an overview of a lot of papers and as long as it is viewed as a starting point to read the papers it is acceptable. Still, the presentation is very fragmented and frustrating, creating a strong desire to read the original papers."
2,The product is not what I expected,"The book is not hardcover, it is not in the best conditions and it is the international version, which I hope it is not going to be a problem during the semester. That is not how the product is described."
5,One of the most solid CDs,"Few CDs have such a high percentage of good songs. Do they sound like the Sisters? I guess in a way, but the music is different and so is the subject matter. Do they sound like the Mission? No, this CD has 8 really good songs on it, and I believe the Mission only have about 3 good songs all together. This is goth at its poppiest. All of the songs are catchy with grooving bass lines and thrashing drum machines. Every song except Shadow and Forevermore is incredibly good, and even the two track I mentioned aren't bad.A warning to people just getting into Rosetta Stone. Just because you like the material on this CD and other early releases, doesn't mean that you will like any of their new stuff. The band made a complete 180 and started making repetitive industrial music with no melody and filtered lyrics. Just a warning."
4,If you like the Sisters of Mercy...,"Rosetta Stone is a blatant rip-off of the Sisters of Mercy. Rosetta Stone's riffs, singing, even their cover art smacks of the Sisters. Now on the lighter side, their are many bands which attempt to play in the style of the Sisters of Mercy and fail miserably - Rosetta Stone is not one of these bands. Their music is tight and professional sounding. In the song Adrenaline in particular there is an amazing, original bass line. The singing doesn't sound contrived and feels full of genuine emotion. So, in short, if you like the Sisters of Mercy, you'll either love this band or hate them. Rosetta Stone Adrenaline loses one star for originality, but gets 4 because they somehow manage to put out good music anyhow."
4,Review on Handbook for Boys,"I think that Handbook for Boys is a great book. This book is about a boy named Jimmy, who gets in trouble with the law, for selling drugs to help his mother.Jimmy's mother can't afford to get him out of jail.So Duke lets Jimmy work at his barbershop as his punishment.That is where Jimmy learns about life and problems people face everyday.I would reccommend this book to anyone,but more for teenagers."
4,The book was Great!!!,"Dear Other Readers:My name is Joe Baker and from my very own point of view I thought the book Handbook for Boys, A Novel, by Walter Dean Myers was great. The book is about this boy Jimmy Lynch who lives in Harlem. He spends most of his after school time working for Duke. Duke owns a Barber Shop on 145th street, which is off Seventh Avenue. Jimmy is sixteen years old and he works at the barber shop because he is on probation for assault. Jimmy only has to work there for about six months so he wouldn't have to go to a youth house. Jimmy is always talking to Duke, Edward McCormick and Mister M about his very own life. Duke had told Kevin who also works for him that he would pay for him to go to college and if Jimmy had finished high school he would pay for him as well. If you would like to continue knowing what had happened throughout the book then pick it up at your local library."
4,A book to teach and entertain,"This book by the renowned Walter Dean Myers is aptly named. It is not so much a work of fiction as it is a guide to those young men who must navigate the rough shoals of life as an African-American male teenager. This is a book with a mission to instruct and entertain, but, primarily, instruct. If you object to didacticism in fiction, this is not the book for you. But if you think this is an important message--I think it is--then you must admire Myers' craft in making it much more than a tract."
4,What to do and what not to do.,"I like this book because it had a lot of realistic parts in it. The book also had a bunch of shocking parts in it. There were a lot of lessons and what to do and what not to do. It raised a lot of questions, like why did Kevin go to jail? Also, the people in the book made it really good, because they were all really different. It was telling how the people that did not do what Duke said got in trouble, like they went to jail. Unlike the people that did listen to him, they are doing well in life. I highly suggest this book."
5,"Dries super fast, packs down to nothing, true to size","I bought these for when I travel. I hand wash them in the evening and they are dry by morning. Also good for hiking bc the material breathes and I hate ""swamp butt"" as another reviewer put it. I will be buying 2 more pairs for my BugOut bag. They pack down to nothing! They are true to size also."
4,Rudy hits a winner again,"Though not as personal as Bless Me, Ultima, Alburquerque is a superb novel about love, politics, family and finding one's self amidst the trappings of modern life. Anaya weaves a intricate story with several (perhaps too many?) characters who cover the entire spectrum of life in The Burque. As a former resident of Alburquerque, I love reading Anaya on the days I'm homesick for the bosques, green chile, and the warm summer nights. Just one chapter in, and I'm home again. If you enjoy novels about life and all of the sad & happy, beautiful & ugly, physical & mystical elements that make up our daily lives, then read Alburquerque and all of Rudy Anaya's books."
5,Alburquerque,"I have just a few pages left but I had to let everyone know Mr. Anaya can sure put a hell of a story together. I am almost sorry the Story is now coming to an end. This is my first book of Rudolfo Anaya's and I do intend to read others. I have also bought Serafina's Story's. Can't wait to get into it, love his characters."
2,"Lots of story, little telling","Each chapter has a dramatic (perhaps melodramatic) event or revelation, but these events are not told with particular style or eloquence. In this sense I agree with the reviewer who says the book reads like the script for a film rather than a novel.... There are plenty of events and characters and conflict, but they are not conveyed in a way to make me believe them or care that much, to experience them in some particular way. Two characters meet and suddenly they are in love. One character gets angry with another, and this is described as ""He felt like hitting Dominic, or choking him until his anger went away."" Wow. That sentence makes me sense and understand the character's deep emotions. Not.... The novel is filled with very perfunctory characterization. Characters are Mexican because they like tortillas or use an occasional Spanish noun. A character is a veteran because he refers to Vietnam as ""Nam."" A character is Indian because she feels a ""kinship"" with nature."
2,Good photgraphes,"This book is full of good information, especially for beginner. However, I was very disappointed that it did not include any specifications or wiring diagrams. For example, even to do a simple oil change the book said to refer to the Factory Manual for specifics.............. so what do I need the book for in the first place? I hope that the author adds the necessary information to make the book complete."
2,It's no repair manual!!,"When you buy this book, you're under the assumption that it's going to walk you step by step through the maintanence of your V-Twin. It doesn't. I'd check for better resources before buying this book. It's ok for the beginner, but it's not adequate for experienced riders."
2,"Not a ""How To"" manual","Don't be misled by the index that this is a repair manual. It's hard to find a page in the repair or troubleshooting section that doesn't contain the words ""refer to the Harley Davison service manual""."
2,why sell this book,why sell this book if all or almost all reviews are negative??? That is something I would be concerned about if this was my business!!!
4,second time to try to post my review,"it was gritty, raw and interesting, great film, as per my main review hopefully appearing right under this review when you do a search by movie."
4,"Africa never seemed as visceral, real and ahem, MODERN!","I liked this. Something I can't put my finger on, but it had a real, raw feel to it but wholly accessible to us Westerners/Americans. It was strangely charming, just so gritty but endearing. Another example that less is more, so HEAR THAT JAMES ""cocky SOB"" CAMERON? This had a reduced, but REAL feel to it and it was bizarre for me admittedly to see such a people I consider so 'backasswards' (as we say in TX) to have such American cultural references. All the characters were so believable, real, affable, and the syncopated music was totally MTV. An unusual experience but a great, pleasurable one. C'est si bon....quel terrible! C'est magnifique!"
4,great for hiking,"I ordered these shoes for trail running over the winter. However, they are better for hiking because of the stiffness of the shoe. That being said they are supportive and comfortable. Aafter many miles, it is nice to enjoy a hike, and not worry about foot pain."
2,boring,My child found the program boring -- too much lecturing & not enough practice. I also was disappointed in the unimaginative games they created to reinforce learning. Will buy something else instead & wish I could return the darn thing.
1,Keep looking,"The program has a nasty habit of crashing in Windows XP. It also uses British spelling, which was not mentioned in the product description. The program does not do a very good job of keeping kids engaged, as there seems to be more lecturing than actual spelling practice. I do not recommend this program."
3,Politics Politics Politics,"The book primarily focuses on Jeferson's political career, namely secretary of state, starting with the formation of the presidency (1788). The book sometimes focuses too much on the political front, and less on Jeferson's personal life and character."
5,Helpful book,I bought a scanner and know nothing so anything helps. Seems well written and organized. Look forward to using it more.
5,Very Useful,"I manage to learn the basic of Automotive, very informative for me. I highly recommended this books to everybody loves Automotive"
4,The information is unmatched The paper quality is so so so POOR,"The information is unmatched. The paper quality is so so so POOR. From my very first viewing of this book pages were damaged.The information in this book makes it a must have ""Reference Book"". The paper stock it is printer on is poor quality. Poorer quality than any news paper, paper I have read in any part of the world I have been in. Even treating this book very carefully pages split. I feel that it will crumble in front of my eyes over a few months use."
4,Good Companion,This book is a must have when you are operating a diagnostic business. Very informative and easy to interpret and understand.
5,OBD 2 Haynes Manual,You can't go wrong ordering this book with your OBD2. It goes into great detail on problems and codes.Everyone who tinkers on their car needs this.
5,Great Helper!,This book greatly helps me better understand the readings I get when checking our cars.Would strongly recommend for anyone who works on their ouw cars.
1,Haynes Techbook on OBD-II,Not worth the money I paid for it....basic information that is already assumed if you own and use a scanner.
3,just okay,Could get just amount of info off internet just makes it easier to look look up problems but still had to do more research
4,.Haynes Techbook OBD-11,.I like the book because it was simple and easy to understand. the fault the pictures should be in colour.
4,OBD-II insight,"The book is quite useful to help one understand how the OBD-II system works. It may not solve your current problem, but at least you will have some idea of what causes the ""service engine"" light to come on and sometimes go off. It makes no bones about the fact that some problems are difficult to solve."
2,Limited Info,"This book is simplistic and not worth the paper its printed on. If you decide to purchase an OBD 2 Scanner, most likely you do not need this book, as the codes are listed on manuals that come with the scanner or with my scanner a CD and a manual. This book contains some basic troubleshooting information and techniques, but is very limited and basically the same that you would find in the introductory section of a haynes or chilton manual for a specific model of car. I do not feel my money was worth the print and I am sorry to any tree lovers out there. I gave the book 2 stars because it did contain the DTC codes."
4,Loads of information,"A wonderful addition to my ever growing Haynes Techbook collection, this book will have enough information for the majority of Do-It-Yourself types."
5,Great book for psilocybin mushroom identification,"The first 5 chapters of this book had me glued to the pages. The book starts off with some fascinating history and personal information about psilocybin mushrooms. The rest of the book gives some very detailed information for hunting them. Some of the pictures are rather small, but for the most part identification is very helpfull with this book, but I would get at least one other field guide to go with it."
5,Best Psilocybin Book out there,"If you're a psilocybin guru like me, or even just a mycology enthusiast. Then this book will have you addicted with all the wonderful information about psilocybin everywhere in the world. From how they grow to spore prints, to getting ready to cultivate even."
5,best feild guide for psilocybes and much more,"great feild guide, full of nifty info and awesome pics. deff recomend to anyone interested in mycology!!!"
4,Informationally acceptable,The content of this book is informative and well-written. It is a little thread bare in terms of cultural facts though. This is definitely a survey of the subject.
4,A first review,"Picked the Good Dating Guide up at the airport on my way to France for a few days R&R. Based on good common sense, the author offers ground rules on most of the do's and dont's for succesful dating, for both males and females. I thought the section on how to handle rejection in a positive manner was excellent, and probably worthy of a chapter (if not a book) in its own right.Easy to read, and interspersed with many anecdotes, it will proabably come off the shelf for a re-read before long."
1,Bad choice,"There are so many better choices. Much of the information is sketchy, redundant, or just wrong. Steer clear of this one."
5,Wonderful,"Wonderfully mellow, in the tradition of the bossa nova style, the lyrics and vocals are graceful and elegant on this gem of an album."
2,Bandai's Best,"This is Bandai's Best vg ever! As a .hack//fanatic , I watch the show, and it's not the same. You'll still enjoy it though. It's an rpg where you don't take turns (thank god!), and you try to find out what happened to Bear (Orca). You make friends like Mimiru (Blackrose), and Tsukasa (Elk)on the way. You obtain the power of the braclet, which gives you DATA DRAIN. You can trade with people and raise/command grunties(>=O which are different than from the show!)I'm not going to give the end away ,but I'll tell you this ... ... it's a great game.Here are some of the +s and -s+shave a party of up to 3 inc. youbased on the showgruntiesDATA DRAIN; GATE HACKINGawesome magic and physical attacks& effectsFree 45 min. ANIME DVD (Japanese ANIME all the way!)much more I can't fit-sYou can't choose you're ilk (you have to be a TWIN BLADE)leveling up [is not good]time dungeonsIt's a ""to be contiued""It's deserves 4 stars.Also : if you like Xenosaga GET THIS GAME"
5,ONLY THE BEST GAME EVER!,"Wow. I don't know what to say. It's my favorite PS2 game. Well, My favorite game... I need a strategy guide thing... It's really comlicated in the begining, but you get used to it... I really like the characters! (except for orca!!!) especially BlackRose. :D And Mia (the cat girl) biya! and buy this game!"
5,It was awesome!,It was a great game I mean I didn't know a whole lot about .hack//SIGN but watching the dvd and some on tv and playing the game helped me learn alot.My cousin who is the worst video game player in the world thought it would be too hard but he got pretty far.It is hard enough to challenge skilled players but not hard enough to where you get frustrated.I found it really cool to see these characters and awesome worlds.I had fun playing through the adventure and naming my character.It doesn't have a technical playing system it was mainly x and square.I didn't have trouble playing the game or understanding the plot I found it really fun.It was exciting and interesting and I would recommend it for any player it was very neat!
3,its ok,"i thought that this game could have definitley been better considering how much hype it recieved. i played thid game for three days and beat it, no guides or gameshark. the game truly is nothing special but the story line will leave you wanting more so i will continue to buy the series, but be warned that true RPG players will most likely find this game easy and not worth the money you'd pay for it!!!!"
5,The Best Game Ever,"This is the best game I've ever played! It has a couple of charecters that I know of (Kite,Orca,Black Rose,Mia,Elk,Natsume) It is fun to play the game and watch it unfold in front of your eyes. I haven't finished the game but I like it so far. Overall I suggest the game to all videogamers."
4,ups and downs of hack,"The Good- amazing story line that leaves you hanging- Graphics are pretty decent- you are able to create different parties (friends to accompany you on your particular adventure)- the sense of an actual living network is very strong- free range the game allows an amazing amount of freedom..you can explore hundreds of different areas..optionally. Even after you complete the game!- Mini games, like raising grunties (pig like creatures you can ride)- the game comes with a 45 min. DVD, which like the game has a strong storyline.The Bad- The game is pretty short..though you can still play, the storyline just doesn't advance.-repeating graphics..the dungeons have different catagories.. ice castle, normal castle, cave, and insides (human, dog or snail) In the beginning they are all very exciting, but towards the end a little tiring.- monsters also tend to repeatoverall this is a very fun game...but still not the best.I definately would buy, but if sceptical rent."
3,Addictive but short.,"If you're a huge fan of either MMORPGs, running around collecting rare items, or levelling your characters to godhood, this game is for you. I find the battle system/skills system to be quite enjoyable. It lends itself very well to mindless levelling and good old-fashioned carnage. The dungeon set-ups are pretty sweet, and I like the variety to the environments. Another really big plus is the option of using the Japanese voice track, which is something a purist like me has been begging for in the new generation of RPGs.Now, on to the bad news. The gameplay is rather shallow. There are no minigames to speak of, though some of the extras you can unlock will keep you amused for a little while. There isn't much to the game, either. I think I'm going to be lucky to get 25 hours out of this one, which is somewhat disappointing."
4,Excellent game offering a refreshing twist on the RPG.,"I recently bought this game and I must say that I have enjoyed every second I have played it. The people who designed this game took the normal RPG format and gave it a refreshing twist. It is not the same stale RPG. The game interface is uniquie and nicely done, and it does not take countless hours to figure out how to play this game unlike some of the newer RPG out on the market. The graphics are great, and the charater design is strong with a developing storyline that is going to be followed in 3 additional games. Overall this is a great game and if you enjoy RPGs then buy this game ASAP you will enjoy it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the fact that the game is somewhat short. I can't wait until the next game in the seires is released."
4,My Thoughts,My thoughts of the game would have to be about 4 stars. It is a very good game indeed and I like most everything about it. But the downside is (well maybe a downside for most people) Is that when you start to play the game you want to play again and again. And basicly it sucks you roght into the game so you cant stop but otherwise I love this game alot i really like the very deatailed graphics and everything else about it! I rate this game at 4 stars because the game deserves a good grade on how fun it is!
5,A Satisfying twist in the RPG world....,"This game is asome!! It is about a boy named Kite who in the real world is invited by a friend to try an online game (not realy online) called The World. While in The World Kites friend is attacked by some monster wich puts him in a coma in real life. Kite is then transformed by a white player in the game, and is turned into an outlaw player. Desperate to revive his friend, Kite sets out in The World... The graphics are simply amazing, and the battle resembles Kingdom Hearts, minus the stupid camera problems. Dot.Hack:Infection is part one in a four part series of games. Let me give a basic reveiew:GAMEPLAY:9 SOUND:9 REPLAY:10 FUN:10 OVERALL:10= 5 starsThis game is AMAZING!!! For those of you dont already know, there is a tv show that airs on Cartoonetwork Saturdays at 3:00PM. Simply put, this should be an interesting game.LOG OUT."
5,very good!!,"it wsa good, I liked the characters!! they had awesoem abilites, don't be fooled between the anime and the this game because they are totally different.......but it is a good game so go out there and get it!!"
1,Waste of Money,"Now don't get me wrong, I love dotHack. I'm one of those kids who sits around in the bookstore reading the manga. So I thought even if the game wasn't so good, I could deal with it. Right? Uh. No.I forced myself to play for about two hours. The graphics were insanely bad, the voice acting made me squirm, and the dungeons were just horrible. There were a couple of intriguing concepts in it, which could've been awesome if handled right - as it is, I think they ultimately take away from the game. For instance, the idea of picking words to shape a custom dungeon was really cool, but maybe if they hadn't done that they would've been able to spend more time on actually making the dungeons interesting and playable. Also, being a total Warcrack addict, I liked the idea of a simulated MMORPG, but after a while reading the stuff on the forums to get new words and hints and stuff just gets tedious."
1,"Lame, repetitive, and how many more do I have to buy???","Wow. I was thuroughly disappointed with this game. I feel lucky I am going to sell it to a friend for a fraction of what i paid for this.The story is spotty, the graphics are soooo 4 years ago (hehe), the gameplay is boring and repetitive and the game is so short that an introductory price to this INSTALLMENT of the whole game should be around $20. If you paid full price, for this game, and the rest in the series, I hope you have a fat bank account.With the lackluster graphics being so cheap looking, found and won items being uninteresting or not useful until you buy another game in the series, I have to say I want to WARN everyone that you do not get what you paid for.If you are one of those who are happy with this game: good. I'm not... so off to Target to buy Final Fantasy Unlimited Saga. Final Fantasy series, not that's a REAL game.Blah!"
2,Weird,This is a weird RPG with a weird plot. Bad graphics. Ugly environments. The The fighting system is bad. You have to stop. Characters are not who you'd care about. Just a bad game.
2,very dirty,"The game came in dirty and the disc is all scratched up. I am not sure if it even works. Would not consider this item in good condition,"
5,Be prepared for a new Generatin of RPGs,"An extremly clever game that simulates an online game. You receive e-mails from your party,you can write questions on a board and get them answered and you can check the news of that world. it's amazing:1. Story line: great, you even get to know wht is happening in the outside world by watching a 45 minute anime DVD! how cool is that? you can't get bored with this game as it is always on the move.2. Graphics: Graphics are very good but not in FFX style nor in Grandia's [disappointing] graphics. it is colorful, detailed and near animation like except it's in 3D you can check screen shots on the net like I did (and i'm extremly careful when it comes to graphics).3. Music: It has great classic RPG type of music, great enough to put you in the area's mood. If it is happy, dull ya know.overall, this game is worth and to make it more interesting buy the anime series, it's great."
3,mixed feelings.....,"This is a pretty good game that could have been an incredible one. The concept is interesting, but the game simply is not deep enough. I was really let down when I finished it in about 16 hours, and I wasn't making any effort to hurry through the game. The main storyline is very short and could have been developed into something more involving. In a sense, you could probably play this game for months without finishing all the possible levels, but they are essentially pretty repetitive after the main story is finished. I think this is a very mediocre execution of a great concept."
4,"Fun, involved",This game is a blast. I know its old and its graphics aren't as great as they could be but the game play and story line are great. I just wish part 2 wasn't so expensive. The game news is funny because some of the 'predictions' have come true. I also like how the game interacts with you as much as you interact with it. A newer/updated version would be awesome but this is a great classic.
4,Repeatative but fun. One of my old favorites,It's fun. I like the different creatures and characters. It's fun to watch the DVD that comes along with this. It's a good explaination of how the game works without being a lame instructional video. I'd say this is one of my favorite games from my childhood gaming days.
1,Disappointing,"I was excited about this game at first but found the game to be a big disappointment. Zenasaga is a much better game.My biggest disappointment was game play. Graphics are poor and the dungeons are plain and boring. Bandai should take note of the game play in Kingdom Hearts.The movies, however, are well done.A fiend broke his .hack CD. Bandai would not replace it for a small fee as other video game companies do. They wanted the full [amount]."
1,Boooring!,"Overall, this game was annoying, long, and stupid. The only reason I finished it was for the cut-scenes. Wish I had a shut-up button for this."
4,i wish it was online,the game was awsome. my favorite charector was elk. i really liked the extensive dungeons where you get to kick ---. but the controls are a bit off. for me though i got bored because it was offline but other then that i loved it
3,Not much to say.,"I have been playing this off and on since I got it, and anyone who is a fan of this series would enjoy this game. I feel it's a bit of a let down that all the games aren't in the same game, as now I have to shell out for each one in turn, but overall the game is something fun to do, and has yet to get old."
5,The Party,I actually bought this book as a inside joke thing for my 16 year old daughter. We used to read it ALL the time when she was little and sometimes we quote it when one of is going to a party. She got so excited when I gave it to her. I see it out in her room sometimes so I know she's reading it - shes an honor role student and taking all AP classes in her Junior year. I think this calms her...
4,new stuf,"I'm a fan of PYT, so i reaaally liked the single!!! It's a great song that is sure to become a hit song! and the rest of the clips are awesome too!"
1,Same Ol' Same Ol',"What a revolutionary group! Four best friends come together to groan out the saddest excuse for a pop song I've ever heard. This ""remarkable"" single includes some of the most painful vocals and pointless lyrics I've ever heard. Discovered (or perhaps just doing a cameo appearance?) in Mandy Moore's Candy video, the girls have been struggling to put out a single and album since. They've suceeded in getting their music in the public eye, unfortunately, people are now laughing their heads off at them!The usual requirement of a group:1. Good looking2. Able to hit middle Cand 3. Able to dance.PYT meets none of these. The good girl groups(Dream, M2M and I5) are very good indeed. PYT, however, needs to rethink their act."
4,PYT not just some other girl group...Its true!,"Personally I'm quite sick of trite,cliche,and boring pop muisc...Although this music from PYT is nothing new they make it refreshing with their tight harmonies and mature vocals for 15yrs girls,and best friends at that!!!They were'nt formed from auditions!!! Not that that would make them any worse...PYT has grown ALOT since they first came onto the seen with ""Something more beautiful"" their first true single,but their album wasn't released back in 1999 like it was supposed to be...It got delayed they redid most of the album,and came out with this awesome song ""Same ol Same ol"" and the rest of the snip its are pretty good as well. I would have rated it a 5 except for the reasons I gave at the beginning of this reveiw. So check out PYT the single is cheap and worth every penny!!!"
5,P.Y.T. is down with me!,"First, let me point out something- for all of those who think P.Y.T. is another version of Dream (as in Britney vs. Mandy BAckstreet vs. NSYNC), think again. P.Y.T. have been around since 1999, long before dream. I have been a fan since then, but hadn't heard much about their music b/c the release date has been changing. when I bought this single, it was every thing I wanted it to be- cool pop with Major RnB in. The song is NOT average calorie-filled pop music. It is a stand-out anthem song, a category popular to women. Anyway, the snippets are cool, too. I normall DESPISE snippets b/c they're 10 seconds long, but w/ this, you get a good sense of the songs. If you want a break-through band, check out P.Y.T.!"
5,Grappling With The Questions of Life,"Few author's could have taken on the task of combining the major tenants of modern philosophy, a road trip with an ""interesting"" colleague to a philosophy convention, a crazy family, the underbelly culture of lowland South Carolina and professional wrestling in a little over 250 page -- but Cooper succeeds hilariously. An interesting combination of sarcastic and sharp biting comedy and some serious investigations into life's most difficult questions. If you like John Kennedy Toole, you will love Ron Cooper. One of the best first novels I have ever read since A Confederacy of Dunces."
1,Not recommended.,"My summation:A) promiscuous anal sex is bad for healthB) male homosexuality promotes promiscuous anal sexWe should stop A by stopping B.The rest of book gives one-sided arguments for why homosexuality is a choice (and a bad one) and how turning to Christianity can solve this. As a Christian, this book gave me the same feeling I have seeing fellow Americans being rude in a foreign country or males being chauvinistic: what a terrible representative Dr. Satinover is for a part of my identity. The book's unbalanced nature felt like hate dressed up like salve and every chapter was a chore to read."
1,Problematic for many reasons,"If there is no ""(...) gene"", then there is no ""straight gene"", either, which eradicates any argument for ""natural"" (inborn or genetic) (...) orientation. In fact, orientation is probably MOSTLY genetic but influenced by environmental factors as well. Can people change? Maybe, and Satinover provides evidence that at least a superficial change is possible.Should they? I'm not convinced. Not all (...) people are (...) addicts (remember that a third of heterosexuals in Africa are HIV positive). We can be ""conditioned"" to be just about anything: so what? What are the reasons for even wanting to change? Pressure from parents/society? We can all impose a different way of thinking and feeling upon ourselves, and in some cases I believe this will end up doing more harm than good."
5,Great Book. a must read!,"This is a must read, its a great book, explains in detail why this book is a must read."
1,"Oh, yes!","Yet another wonderful book to rationalize americas prejudice towards anything ""different"". First it was blacks, then women, now gays. If you want to be amazed by manipulated facts, half-truths, and outright lies, then this book is for you. Gives the american people grounds for even more prejudice, just what we need in this world."
1,nonsense,Books such as these continue the myth that homosexuality is wrong - it is sad to think some people still believe this nonsense. Also these so-called experts are directly responsible for the deaths of so many gay people as they struggle to come out. When will the ignorance end?
1,Here's how to read this book.,"Everytime you see the word ""homosexual,"" substitute the word ""Jew."" Whenever you see ""homosexuality,"" substitute the word ""Judaism.""Then close your eyes and pretend you are in Nazi Germany and you're listening to a lecture about ""the Jewish problem."" Then go home and read your bible, ""Mein Kampf."" After all, isn't it the revealed truth?Not too pretty a picture, is it? When authors write attack books that purport to tell the ""truth"" about one group, no group is safe.This author's position is not so secure that he can afford to throw rocks at gays. Some day, he and other homophobes (Dr. Laura, William Kristol and the grand rabbi of Brooklyn) may find themselves being marched off to a labor camp by the same Christians they now so avidly court.History has a persistent way of repeating itself.I borrowed this book out of curiosity. I found little to admire.Read it if you want, but follow my suggestion about substituting words.Got my drift?"
3,Scientificly weak analysis of treatment for homosexuality,"The book makes a good analysis and is an excellent survey of various scientific studies on the causes of homosexuality. Thus, it is an useful mean for having a good understanding and expanded knowledge on what the causes and determinants on homosexuality are (biological, sociological, inherited, developed, etc). However, it does do a similar scientific and objective analysis on the treatments of homosexuality. In the second part of the book, he precipates to early conclusions that do not follow from his previous analysis. In addition, recommendations and ""best treatment"" does not account for condition or severity differences among homosexual groups, and he, without any scientific rigor, ends just ""selling"" one type of treatment to all homosexuals. This fact seems to be very unprofessional, unmoral and unscientific, and raises legitimacy issues to his recommendations."
1,Where's the truth?,"There's a lot about homosexuality, but hardly any truth in this book.This author clearly hates gays and is on a mission to make their lives miserable. Whatever god he believes in clearly doesn't believe in love, fairness, or treating other people with respect. If only I could give this book zero stars."
1,propoganda and nothing more.,"propoganda and nothing more. He uses ""gods word"" to declare homosexuality immoral and evil..."
1,Sexuality not an issue of politics nor religion!,"Oh, to behold the barely contained glee in the previous reviews, by those who finally have found thoughts from someone as ignorant as themselves to cling to. How many of those same readers even know a gay person? They might sing a far more tolerant tune if they'd bother to open their minds to the real fact that other people's sexual preference should be nobody else's business. It's an issue of biology; not of politics, and certainly not of religion. The whole thing reminds of the not-too-distant past when lefties had their left hands tied behind their backs to force them into the ""normal"" way of writing. When will we learn?"
1,They are missing the irony,"All of the conservatives and fundamentalists coming to defend this horrible book are missing the irony of the fact that its author is a world-class, new age flake! It is hilarious that they are supporting the ""science"" of this work by an author who has tied his professional reputation to JZ Knight. In case you don't know, Ms Knight claims to be channeling Ramtha, a 35,000-year-old enlightened teacher from Atlantis. Really! All of you right-thinking individuals ought to take a look as Mr. Satinover appears with Ramtha in the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know."" I am not sure he is the one you want making your case on homosexuality."
3,Beneficial for those interested in changing,"This book is a little scientific, but for those really seeking change it leads you to the correct place. The cross. The only way to change is to surrender your will."
1,Should be Zero Stars,"Quackery of the highest order. Not one of the good ""Dr's"" ""scientific"" arguments has ever been peer reviewed. Satinover is scientific like creationism is scientific -- NOT. Pseudoscience of the worst sort. Pure unadelterated garbage for the gullible Xtian fundamentalist."
4,Review on H & Politics of Truth,"I found the first part of the book to be great. But when he went on to talk about Skinnner's views on each person being born as a blank slate, I just never have agreed with Skinner's views on personality traits and the role nuturing plays in us developing and becoming who we are."
4,Germs - 'Media Blitz' (Cleopatra),"The Germs career was,sadly cut short when vocalist Darby Crash (1959-80)died of a heroin overdose. Crash (birth name: Jan Paul Breahm) has been said by some to have actually out do Sid Vicious as for living the life of a 'real punk'. Either way, The Germs were a good full-throttled all American punk band, ANY way you slice it. Tracks here that had me sit up and take some notice were ""Round 'N Round"", the in-your-face ""Sex Boy"", ""Manimal"", ""Shut Down"" and ""Throw It Away"". Should appeal to fans of Dead Kennedys, The Zeros, Social Distortion, Black Flag and Circle Jerks. A worthy pick of old school punk."
5,the absoloute best of early punk,"Darby Crash is a god. The germs music is the original punk, this is the kind of music that insites you to hit things. I think anyone who likes punk rock should buy this cd, or they will face death. The germs are the absoloute best punk rockers, and they should still be around today (unfortunately they aren't)."
2,Horrible recording of some great songs,"This disc wasn't worth what i paid for it when I had it ordered for me in a music store. I had to settle for this since the M.I.A. anthology is no longer in stock , and I was very disappointed. ""Forming"" was the only song worth listening to , the others were muddy and poorly recorded with the bass and drums blocking out the guitar and vocals. Wait for the anthology to be rereleased , don't get this."
2,Bad Recordings,I have an vintage (vintage in a bad way) tape player/radio that can make better recordings that what this cd has on it. But The Germs are a really good band so by all means get their other albums just not this.
2,For University Trained Philosophers,"This is an excellent scholarly treatment of Pope John-Paul II'sthinking and worldview. The only drawback is the book is written at a ""16"" reading level, meaning you must have graduated from college with a major in philosophy. Therefore, I recommend the author's other book on the same subject written for non-college graduates. I gave it two stars because the author and publisher did not make this clear on the book jacket - - in order to sell books, of course - - and they only printed the other edition after having received a lot of flack from critics and book stores, which had too many returned because buyers could not understand the material. In my opinion, this should have been a college textbook and not released to the general public; however,as is often the case,greed rules the book market."
3,"Awesome, but Expensive","First let me say I love MILO, I have learned many valuable training techniques & throughly enjoy sitting down to pore over it once it arrives. I also believe that to be successful you must surround yourself with success & reading MILO is a key part of that.That being said, I just went to renew my subscription & found out about the 50% price increase ($53 -> $80). I don't think I can afford such a big jump.Hopefully the folks at IronMind read these reviews & will consider a more reasonable price increase that would be within the means of less fiscally gifted lifters."
2,"You know what a glob is, so what's a gloob?","Not the best book I ever read, but this book is full of funny words you won't find in the dictionary. A kid-friendly book, they might appericate the humor more then I did."
4,almost great,"Tracks 8 to 12 are alone worth the price of the album. It's pure magic. His energy, vocals and pounding guitar make it all worth it. I only wish he selected different songs for the first half of the album. Quite frankly, I'm tired of ""Sunny Sailor Boy"" and ""Pablo."" Such a slow start, why not Blackberry Time or Accoustic Motorbike? Oh well, it's still a keeper."
1,Boring diatribe,"I was a fan of Famous Monsters of Filmland as a kid, and picked up this book hoping for some nostalgic fun and insight into the magazine by the new publisher. It turned out to be nothing but a vindictive rehash of a legal dispute he had with the original editor, Forrest Ackerman. Like listening to a professional victim complain about how unfairly he's been treated, this is a tiresome vanity project, and I found myself skipping through whole paragraphs thinking, ""yadda, yadda, yadda."""
1,Life Is But A Lie,"This had to be one of the worst written, most self-serving pack of lies I ever read. As other reviewers have pointed out, the book serves exactly two purposes: 1)To make the author money 2)to defame an icon. Actually, if you have a fire place, it could serve a third purpose as kindling. To make matters worse, the book is boring. Only recommended as a cure for insomnia."
1,Three Sides to Every Story,"Having worked with some of the individuals mentioned in the book, and being somewhat privy to the events mentioned therein, I can honestly say that I found Mr. Ferry's book to be a most amusing read. While the book was largely free of errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation, that is where my good review must unfortunately end. Mr. Ferry spends so much time slinging mud at those who bore him no ill will that it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the book. He truly knows how to destroy a heroic ideal by painting our idols as petty backstabbers, whose only crime was to take a different opinion than the author. While some may enjoy getting the dirt dished, it is somewhat akin to telling a 7-year old that there is no Santa Claus. This book is cruel, and ultimately pointless. I gave it one star for the afore-mentioned reasonably good grammar and punctuation."
2,The author's character is revealed,"It's hard to put this book down from the standpoint of its crystal-clear lens on the author's shortcomings.The text borders on parody with Ferry's hero-worship of those who (unwittingly) support him, pages-long screeds detailing his heroic handling of simple administrative tasks, and self aggrandizing anecdotes (""[my photo] captured the elusive transition between the pop-art superhero of the 1960s and the somber dark-knight image of the 1990s - - and both of them were Adam West!"")You just can't make stuff like that up."
3,"Nice, but small","I purchased this for my niece for her 18th birthday. She is headed off to college next fall, and I thought this was a really good idea for her to take a month's worth of her jewelry with her... and she could still keep it safe. It's a very nice item and seems to be well made. I was just a little disappointed in the size. For some reason when I looked at the item I thought it was a good size, but when it came it was about 10"" by 10"". She still seemed pleased with it, but I thought it was a bit pricey for as small as it was."
4,Fun and gory!,"Excellent for some good scary, gory fun. I loved it. Plenty of unexpected moments, and lots and lots of blood and gore and explicit kill scenes. This book is a lot of fun to read and I bought both sequels."
3,Doesn't live up to the buzz,"""Clickers"" is OK for a first novel, but it does not live up to its fans' hype. Gonzalez was trying to write a homage to 1950s B-movies, and it almost works -- but on the whole, I'm disappointed."
4,Wonderful Creature-feature horror,"While rough in places, Clickers is a fast-paced enjoyable read that is a throwback to the kind of novels I read as a kid. You know, The Rats and Slugs and books with icky monsters that tore things up and ate people. Clickers is obviously a tribute to that kind of story.Rick Sycheck is a horror writer who moves to a quaint little village on the coast of Maine. No sooner does he arrive but he runs over a giant crab. Within hours, hundreds of these ""Clickers"" are invading town. They have venemous stings that reduce their victims to bubbling mush, and they eat everything in their path. Rick and the villagers band together to fight them off and...as they say in those old movies and commercials...but wait there's more! Something is hunting the Clickers!To go further would spoil the story further. I loved this book. I rate it four stars because it could have used better editing, but don't let that distract you. Clickers is good, solid fun all the way around!"
4,click it or ticket,"I just finished up Clickers by J. F. Gonzalez and Mark Williams. I have to say, I thought it was a great book. A very cool slice of fan fiction meets originality. I will have to admit that although the characters were all great and the story was amazing, it was a little less than what I am used to reading. The story was a little slower than I like. Although it had all of the gore that I love and need, the last few chapters were a little less than desired. At the last minute a lot of new characters got added and suddenly became hard to follow because they had way too many characters running a muck all at the same time. It was cool though because most of them died, but I think it was a little much. Although that was my only personal choice in flaws, I was really happy with the book and look forward to reading the 2nd and third book as well. This book was a prime example of why Deadite Press is awesome."
4,fast paced horror,"A writer escapes big city to small seaside community to write book and is swept up in a wave of terrifying crablike creatures. They are just the beginning of something far worse. I liked this book, although I'll never look at ""Mr. Krabs"" from Spongebob the same again!"
4,Great campy horror,Can't wait to read Clickers 2. Especially since Brian Keene has come aboard. This was a great horror read from start to finish. I could not believe how fast it started and I still had over 200 pages to go.I hope they make this into a movie.....
3,It was good.,Nothing great but a nice interesting readKind of like a old Stephen king style. Fast and very bloody and entertaining.
5,Taste like Chicken.........,This was the first book in the Clickers series and I loved it. It is a great campy B movie style monster horror book with a modern day appeal. J.F. and Mark Williams do a really great job of getting the area set up for a fun wild ride. The characters are well developed for such a campy type story and both authors do such a good job of keeping you in the action and not having any lulls in what is going on in their crazy vision. All I know is if I ever encountered one of these things I would be running the other way and getting my pressure cooker to make some clicker stew! A fun read and can't wait to read the others in the series.
1,Misleading,This is really misleading .... Nowhere in this listing does it say that the stand is not included. None of the reviews say the the stand needs to be purchased separately. One would think that since the picture shows a stand they would say stand not included... This really sucks.
4,Rope Swing,"I enjoy my swing, it is extremely comfortable and has the added perk that the dogs can't join me. Recommend highly"
1,DON'T BUY BOOKS FROM ETS!!! BUY FROM OTHER SELLERS!!,"DO NOT buy any study material from ETS. I just bought a book a while ago for one test code, but ETS changed the test code and now I can't get a refund or even exchange on my book. Also be sure you've registered for the right test and date, they will keep your registration fee!!! DO NOT BUY STUDY MATERIALS FROM ETS, BUY NEW/USED FROM SELLERS ON HERE....NOT ETS!!!"
5,They make the test...Hence the 5 stars,"I used this book along with one other prep manual(Cliffs)and I passed the test on my first try. This book does not give much practice material. The reading, math and writing sections are glossed over. I would not call this book an exclusive prep book. It contains only one practice test. The questions that are given are from an actual old praxis test. So you will get a general idea of what a real test will look like. Another perk this book offers is a complete list of essay topics. My actual essay topic was listed in this book. Even though it is not packed with test prep information, I would still purchase it for the essay topics and old practice exam."
4,Buy this for the real exams,"Since this book is published by the makers of the PPST, anyone taking this test needs to buy this book simply because it contains an actual old exam. I found that this exam was very similar to the actual PPST I took, and my score on the practice exam was a good indicator of my score on the real exam. However, this book is not good if you need a thorough review of the material. It skims over things and does not go into too much detail. I needed a lot of math review and this book did not help too much with that. I also bought the Barron's book and thought that one was great for the review but mediocre on the practice tests (that one did have 3 though and this book only has one, but it is an actual old exam). So if you are taking the PPST definitely buy this book but also buy a good one for a review. For that I would recommend Barrons. I got a 186 on the math and 184 on the reading and am still waiting for the writing. I owe my good scores to these two books."
4,Good tasting,My cats will eat this in the place of Pro Plan Sensitive Stomach. I usually mix it with Pro Plan so it lasts longer.
2,Vomiting problems,"I was giving my cats the Purina minerals for years and years however one of my cats started vomiting and I felt I needed to get something different for her sensitive stomach. I tried the Purina One Sensative and it seems to work a bit better. My cats really prefer the friskies pté now to the dry. I'm afraid they're spoiled and I will try to push the dry food more. Pretty good product.UPDATE: After 1-1/2 bags, the vomiting continued - Amazon notified me that the product was discontinued from their site and suggested Halo which is Ellen's company and quite expensive. Read the reviews and they were all great so I'm giving Halo a shot and hope the cats love it and the stomach problem stops."
5,Great for cats with sensitive stomach,"Even if your cat does not have a sensitive stomach, this food is much better for them then any other grocery store brand that I've seen. Of course, the pet store brands are much better for them then this but you get what you pay for. My cats love this stuff and the cat that will throw up any other grocery store brand will eat this kind just fine.As with any other pet food, please read the ingredients and remember corn does not give any nutritional value to cats! You wouldn't feed your kids bread and meat flavoring for every meal of their entire lives so don't do it to your pets."
1,hmm...,Stupid christians.... certainly not a surprise. By the book for ol' granny if you really want but it won't do any good.
2,Too non-inclusive,"This book is helpful to some extent, but I would reject it on the grounds it is not inclusive of women in its language. Therefore, it automatically closes out a large portion of its would-be audience. We can no longer tolerate spiritual writers speaking as if ""male"" is standard and ignoring the feminine facet of spirituality. There are better guides to spiritual growth out there."
3,An Out of Date Classic of Chess Literature.,"This book was consider the ""Chess Bible"" when published many many years ago, but now is out-dated. Even the author considered the book to be out-dated when he wrote his modern version ""Modern chess strategy"". Don't buy this one, look instead for the ""Modern"" revision.In this last book the author uses a clear and conversational style to clarify problems that may seem difficult or confusing for the beginner or casual player. Even if you don't know the first thing about chess, this book can help you learn the fundamentals behind chess strategy and become a good player within a short period of time. The book is profusely illustrated with hundreds of diagrams and annotated games."
3,longseller from 1915 / re-edited,don't confuse Edward Lasker with the more famous Dr. Emmanuel Lasker from Germany. You may compare the current issue with the original free version available from project Gutenberg.
5,Chess for Success Award for Concepts,This is a wonderful book that has taught twogenerations of players how to play with force.It has won Chess for Success's award for clarityof concepts in the opening and the endgame withfull example games. Great with a notebook!
2,"Snore. Pick a different chess book, there are plenty more.","Boh-ring. One mildly redeeming feature is it's ""table of openings""in the back, but other than this, Lasker's writing style andteaching method will put even a Grandmaster to sleep."
4,I'm...,Sure this could be helpful to the right person...I don't seem to be her! I think it's my age and my physical condition...also my husbands body part and performance...oh well! I still think it's a great book for the right person!
2,Used 200+ pages when15 required,So this book is summed up as: masturbate and a woman's clit is responsible for orgasm. Nothing too profound. I kept reading because I thought I might learn something useful. I was disappointed.
5,My go-to book for Italian,"Every page of this book inspires me to cook and has for several years now. The recipes are delightfully simple, both in terms of number of ingredients and in technique. There are no blurbs about travels and parties. The food alone entices. I've never had a bad meal using this book."
5,Great cookbook! Great italian!!,So many different things in here that are presented well and taste great. A number of recipes in here have become staples of meals I cook now. Can't go wrong with this one!!
2,Bad quality book,"Terrible quality, not so good recipes and measurements made for america. What is wrong in keeping the original format and giving metric measurements?We should be made aware of the measurements format. It is anoying...Not happy."
5,Terrific Italian cookbook,"Great italian recipes. Ingredients wonderfully spelled out,easy directions and beautiful pictures.Presented in such a way that you will want to cook Italian every night!!"
4,Rare insight into Masai life,"This is an enjoyable book that will appeal to anyone interested in East African culture, from the perspective of a ""white boy"" who, besides the colour of his skin, was every bit as Masai as the other kids he associated with.Well worth reading if you want to get an insight into how the Masai lived in the 1920's."
1,Not suitable for beginners,This product is simply awful for beginners. Don't buy this unless you already have a good basic knowledge of the language.
1,What the crap...,Kurt would hate this so much. It isn't right. All the profits that this new Nirvana merchandise is getting is going to COurtney Love. SO WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
3,"Not bad, not amazing","I was excited when I saw this book and couldn't wait to add more chocolate creations to my repertoire. However, I soon got over my excitement. Although the recipes were not bad they were neither exciting nor unique nor uniquely American. Furthermore, I found the design of the book itself lacking in many ways: WAY too much blank space where more photos could have placed, the use of dark (chocolate) colored pages with light text was interesting visually but not conducive for ease of use while trying to bake, many recipes that could have fit on one page (which is an ideal I have for any cook book) carried over to another page (or over 3 pages) because of too much blank space and unnecessarily large font size and line spacing, etc. I think I may use a couple of the recipes from the book but this, in my opinion, is not a ""keeper"" on my shelves. I have found that ""Pure Chocolate"" by Fran Bigelow is a much better chocolate cook book."
4,Helpful overall,"I enjoyed reading this book. As diet/medical books go, it was well written and straightforward for the average reader. The diet and exercise chapters were great and I was able to easily integrate most of the advice into my daily routine with little effort (once I depleted my cabinets of all the unhealthy stuff!). I was kind of bummed toward the end of the book to read about things we don't have any control over that can impact our health and should have just skipped some of those chapters."
2,disapointed,I recieved the package and didn't open it since it was a gift. I found out that goalie stick was missing. I called up and they only thing they can do is have me reship the whole package back and send me another one. I explained that I already gave the item as a gift and couldn't do that. They said there was nothing they could do then.
1,Not much to like...,"Sorry, but I found this book to be full of characters that didn't interest me in the slightest. The characters were filled out with quirkiness rather than depth, and most showed a mean streak, except Liv. I wasn't able to get a full sense of any of the characters except the preachers, who, in their fanaticism, are one-dimensional anyway. I wasn't able to care for these people who dealt with each other only on the surface, and always for their own purposes. Most were abusive to animals, neglecting to feed or water the animals that were their supposed livelihood - something only trash farmers would do. To say nothing of dumping dogs, putting a cat in a dishwasher, and leaving a bull to drown in mud.Hungry for something in common, acceptance, and a purpose missing from each of their dull lives, most cling to the church, faking their way through the expected rituals. These characters didn't stay with me when I closed the book, and neither did the story."
4,A reasonable guide to TPFI.,"Even though this book is 80 pages it does cover enough aspects of TPFI to understand the basics.If you were rebuilding any pre-TPFI chev small block and wanted to modify it with TPFI then this book is a good place to start.There is plenty of information here and diagrams as well.Its written in simple terms so those who arent too mechanically minded will understand it too.For those thinking about designing similar set ups for other engine makes you might find this book of interest.Overall,this is an ideal book to start with.I recommend the author's other book:""Electronic Engine Management Reference Manual"".Its also available from this website.Both books are ideal to use together."
4,A Great Way to Teach History,"Until the late 80's, knowledge about what happened on the Esatern Front was limited, due to many factors, one of which was the totally stereotypical way in which the Soviet participants and historians retold these tremendous events. In the early 90's, with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, historians could, for the first time, access new and heretofore unpublished material. This book represents one of the first of these ""new history"" texts. It describes in broad brushstrokes the huge operations on the Eastern Front which resulted in the collapse of Germany in 1945. In addition, it gives enough human element that one can begin to imagine the untold suffering of both the anonymous soviet soldiers whose lives were squandered by the millions, and of the Germans, both civilians and military who were brushed aside or crushed impersonnally under the irresistible soviet juggernaut. It gives one a whole new perspective on what happened in early 1945."
4,Missing only the finale,"Duffy has written an excellent book on the chaotic times as the Soviets invaded Germany from the east. Some things will never be known with any certainty, but Duffy manages to give a coherent account of a tumultuous time. I give only four stars because the book omits the actual capture of Berlin. In some ways Berlin was anticlimatic, because the Reich was disintegrating, but without Berlin in the book, it feels incomplete."
5,Essential WWII Reading,"Ah, what a pleasure to read such a skilled work of narrative-military history. Professor Duffy wrote this after delving into the Soviet records that opened up after the USSR split open, and the book is a delight to read. Duffy takes the emphasis off the drive to Berlin, and turns instead to the totality of the Soviet drive into Germany- the Vistula-Oder operations. The book is incredibly informative and very, very well written. In addition, it has fascinating appendices on matters such as German and Soviet military tactics & structure, as well as brief descriptions on some of the main weapons used by each side. Please trust me on this one, if you are interested in WWII you will love this book."
2,Mediocre analysis of the march on Berlin,This is a military account of the Soviet march to Germany after Hitler's disastrous attack. While the military descriptions are good the prose is generally disappointing the book is disjointed. It focuses on the military aspects only and pays little to no attention to other social or political factors that were occurring at the time. Little mention is given to the allies and their efforts which were impacting the march but if you are looking for battle descriptions this is the book for you.
2,Poetry with no Form...,"This is a poetry collection, and whoever formatted this edition barely put in the proper line breaks between stanzas, and none within them. Its a jumbled mess, which is too bad as the poems themselves are beautiful."
4,What to look forward to after medical school,"This book tells the stories of a few doctors in America, and the ups and downs of either going into private practice, or joining a group with other doctors. I hope to become a doctor one day, and I never thought about half of the stuff that they have to deal with. If you want to learn about what it is like in the real world, after schooling, this book is for you."
2,poor ergonomics,"The only virtue of the UltraPod is its 4-ounce weight. The ""ball head"" is grossly under-designed for any camera larger than a P&S. The head does not swivel at its base, making it difficult to position the tightening knob where you want it to be. I was going to take it on a trip to Samoa, but I now think I will pack the 12-ounce weight of my Slik Mini-Pro III, and be happier for it."
1,"THIS IS THE WORKBOOK, NOT THE TEXTBOOK!","I thought I bought the textbook until I received it! Since there was no photo I could see for this book, based on very little (or even none!) description, I didn't realize ""paperback"" means ""workbook""! Be careful when you purchase it!"
2,Dull,"I guess this book was kinda interesting. It just seemd to drag on and go deep into FBI procedures and not so much into the everyday life of a gangster. Compared to other Mafia books I've read this is by far the worst. But it is still a mafia book, so I found it to be at least somewhat interesting. I would not recommend this book unless you are more interested in how the FBI fought organized crime, and not the everday operations of a mafia family."
2,Average,The author describes his life in the FBI and how he fought against the mob. The first part of the book is about him trying to become an FBI agent and does not discuss many details about the Mafia. The author comes off very conceded but at the same time describes details of the mob that contradict numerous other books. The biggest example is when he describes Agent Joseph Pistone aka Donnie Brascoe. He describes Pistone as a good friend yet says he infiltrated the Colombo family for 8 years. Any mob enthusiast knows Pistone was involved with the Bonanno Family. It's hard to trust the other facts he lists when getting major facts like Donnie Brasco wrong.
5,Educative Assessment gets ASSESSED,"Grant Wiggins has written an excellent book that delves into, not only the ways in which we can change current assessment practices, but he also explores ways in which we can change policies that drive assessment practices. Wiggins explores various assessment techniques that are found outside the realm of traditional assessment. This book is an amazing eye-opener and it is written in a way that is smart and sometimes humorous. If you are looking for a book about education assessment that causes sporatic narcolepsy you are in the wrong place. Buy it. Read it. You won't be disappointed."
3,Okay,This book was not really helpful for my class. I barely read it so I have no idea what it is about.
2,This book is boring.,I had to buy this book for a class. It is boring and impractical. Even the teacher didn't like it. Some of the theories are good but they are explained in an overly wordy fashion. Most of the examples offered in the book were told from a negative viewpoint that gives the book an overall negative tone. The assessment strategies offered were unrealistic in today's school environment and no particular effort was exerted to explain how any of them could be implemented in a regular public-school classroom.
1,Lighter Doesn't Work,"I live at 7,000 ft and this lighter simply doesn't work. When I first received it, it would light after 15 or 20 strikes, but now it won't light at all. Has to go back for refund."
2,poor quality mechanism ... Brunton has discontinued this lighter,"I went through 4 Brunton Firestorm lighters in the past year, with the lighting mechanism consisting failing after 3 months. My local gear store where I purchased it and who kept replacing it recently told me Brunton has discontinued the lighter. From what I've been told, apparently their production quality took a huge nosedive when whey moved manufacturing to China."
2,Barely works,"Often doesn't light without playing with the angle & setting, and once it light's it's not very storm proof at all (=I can blow it out like a normal candle)"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this lighter to keep in my survival kit in my airplane. I've had it for two years never having to use it. I went on a sheep hunt, grabbed my lighter made sure it was full gave it a whirl. Two days into my hunt in the middle of a pounding blizzard at 5700' elevation my stoves ignitor quit, so I pulled out my trusty brunton storm. After 2 hours of frustration and never successfully getting the lighter to work I switched gears to enjoy an MRE. I took the lighter home wondering if something had got in the orifice, no I blew it out pulled it apart and after 2 hours finally got it to start spraying butane out the side. DO NOT BUY THIS AND COUNT ON IT! It will let you down. I am not sure what to carry besides magnesium and a flint anymore hopefully I find a lighter that works."
3,"Works well at sea level, beware at 8k' or higher","This lighter works great when you're at sea level, and if that's your goal then look no further. It is well built, and lights very easily when enough oxygen is present.If, on the other hand, you take this lighter backpacking at elevations higher than 8,000 feet, then your mileage may vary. It takes a lot of convincing to light at all at these elevations, and you may find yourself without a flame at all.The instructions advise you use premium butane fuel, and to set the fuel level to the lowest setting when at higher elevations, both of which I did. Unfortunately it still took 10-20 ""clicks"" before I got any sort of flame, which is unacceptable."
3,Decent Lighter. Has drawbacks.,"This is a very good design with a couple cut corners that reduce it to merely 'OK'.First, while the fire nozzle area is well designed, the piezo element is not strong enough, and even a new lighter will not light each time.Second, while it is very nice to have a completely removable cap, both the cap and body are made of plastic, and the threads are very fine and very short. End result: the threads are loose to begin with, and they strip out very quickly. If you hand it to someone and they just pull the lid off, it will come off... and after 2-3 times of this, the threads are simply gone, and the cap won't stay on.If the piezo were stronger, and either the threads were better or it used a bayonet-style twist-lock cap, this would be a great lighter. As it is, it's just OK. I don't regret buying it, but don't think it was quite worth the $34 I paid."
1,"Hard to light, not a torch, overpriced","I looked to this lighter to replace the now discontinued Coleman lighter I used to carry. The Coleman was 1/3 the price and worked a lot better.I had no problems filling the lighter but did notice the plastics caps. I did assume that they were metal, as did others. You need to unscrew the cap to use the lighter, which could be problematic. Unfortunately, my first dozen attempts to get a flame failed. I had to turn down the fuel almost all the way down before it caught. Once it caught, I realized that it wasn't really a torch-like flame as was the Coleman. It's more of a Bic-like candle flame. That was really disappointing as I can use the Coleman almost like a pencil. A torch-like flame is also cooler to the hands because the flame is more directed and you can also use it upside-down or on its side. Not so with this Brunton."
1,Bypass this and get the Helios,"I've had a Helios (other Brunton lighter) for about a year and have had absolutely no problems with it so I figured I'd get this one for back up. I filled it the first time noticing the need to completely remove the cap each time I wanted to light it and the plastic bottom. I lit it with no problem and put it into my car. When I went to use it a few days later, it wouldn't light and I noticed it was out of fuel. I immediately thought it had leaked out due to a valve malfunction. When I tried to fill it again, the fuel spewed out everywhere. There is now a crack in the bottom glass and someplace on top underneath the thumb button. I'm in the process of returning it to Brunton for replacement, but don't really want another one exploding in my car."
1,Save your money,"Very unreliable .I have returned mine 5 times for the same problems.It won't fire unless you hit the back,eventually it stops completely.The flame adjustment is not positive,keeps miss firing. Go buy a bic.you can get 30 for the price of one lame storm lighter. Also it will give you no warning of failure,take your matches. On one of my returns I was given instructions on how to slowly push the button to light the lighter.Fix your defective lighter first.Bottom line ,ripoff, stay away."
2,I got it for the discs..but don't bother if you got internet connected to xbox 360,"I got it for the discs demo games but they are always demos that you could have downloaded 4 weeks ago. If they only provide these demos right away then it would be ok. Nothing much on it and has some ads I don't need. out of like 12 issues I only popped in 3 discs.The magazine has a lot of pictures.. but the internet and digital age you dont just look at pictures you look at ign , gamespot, and youtube for video actions.I skim through the magazines. I don't bother reading them all the way through. I do check out what they say on the final thoughts in each review and pretty much that's it. It's great if you're on the plane or on the road."
4,Great Magazine However It Is Available With The Demo Disk,"The demo disk can do what no printed publication can ever do. It can let you see the game in motion. This allows you to get a better idea of what the game is really like rather than strictly relying on the opinion of the publication's reviewers.Overall, it is an excellent magazine but I would say that you would be missing something if you only got the magazine alone."
1,NO DISK????!!!,"WARNING!! I was just notified by Amazon that this subscription does not include the disc that usually comes with this magazine when you buy it at the newstand. Getting this disk and being able to play the upcoming game demos on it was one of my main reasons for subscribing. Needless to say, I have cancelled my subscripton here and will be finding this magazine elsewhere."
1,Too early to review,"Still waiting for this magazine subscription to start. I payed $5.00 for a one-year subscription with the game disc. When I start receiving this item ""as advertised"", I will be happy. Until then, still waiting."
1,The Magazine Is Fine! This Deal Could Be Better!,"Just like the other fine folks here, I bought this Xbox Magazine Special, (before it said that the disk was not included) and then by reading the other reviews, found out that the disk isn't included with the magazine. What? I didn't even know that it was sold that way! [...]It's like buying an Xbox game & then finding out that only the instructions and DVD cover come with the package, (but not the game itself). Hey, the XBOX Magazine is a fine product, but it's the DEMO Disk that makes the Xbox Magazine package worth it. Save your money and get the whole package (demo disk included). [...]"
1,No Demo Disc,"Beware you only get the magazine which is fine, but you want the demo disc. Pay the full subscription price and get the disc. I messed up and thought it came with it, but it did not.Go direct to Image media and update your subcription."
3,xbox magazine falls short,"Even though I own an Xbox, I haven't gotten a subscription to this magazine because I find that, for the most part, GameInformer (which I do have a subscription to) tends to have much better reviews for Xbox games than the so-called ""official Xbox magazine"". That being said, I do occasionally pick up an Xbox magazine from a local newsstand just to catch up on the world of Xbox mania, and I do admit that their coverage of the newly released Xbox 360 is quite exemplary. However, I don't recommend you get this magazine if you are looking for the Xbox demo discs. Why? BECAUSE THIS MAGAZINE DOESN'T HAVE THEM (another reason for the 3-star rating).Signing off,Andy Olson"
3,"Mag. Content Okay, Disk Content Great","As the other reviewers have noted, the real value of this magazine is the disk. There have been many games I thought I wanted to buy, only to be severely disappointed by the demo. The money you shell out for the disk will pay for itself in games you don't buy after playing the demos. As for the magazine itself, it is useful and entertaining. You have to read through the bias though. Remember, they work for Microsoft."
3,No Disc? You've Gotta Be Kidding,"Half of the reason to get the Official Xbox Magazine is because of the demo disc. Unlike the Official PS Magazine or Nintendo Power (Official magazines for their respective consoles), the official Xbox magazine provides very little in terms of magazine content. Just one or two short articles, some previews and reviews. So what is the magazines saving grace? The demo disc. So when you subscribe, find an offer so that you get the disc."
1,"NO DEMO DISC! Trust me, this is for the magazine only","Here's the deal, I purchased this subscription thinking ""[PRINT + DVD]"" was actually TRUE. My first issue just came with NO DEMO DISC, and after calling Future (the subscription service provider) I was informed that the only way to get the Demo Disc is to either pay an extra dollar per issue over the phone, or have my amazon subscription canceled, and a new one started directly through them. Of course you have to pay again, and wait 4-6 weeks for a refund check for the original subscription.In summary:1 year subscription of magazine from Amazon = $24.951 year subscription of magazine AND DEMO DISC from Official Xbox Magizine website = $24.95You fail Amazon"
3,Good Magazine But No Demo Discs,I enjoy the magazine but.....FYI - this magazine does NOT include the demo discs with each issue. (...)
2,Slowest delivery time EVER,I ordered this subscription close to 2 months ago but have yet to get the first Issue. However I recieved the first issues of the other two magazines that I ordered AT THE SAME TIME (Nintendo Power & PSM) almost 2 weeks ago. I am very disappointed.
1,Never got my magazine,I ordered on May30 for $5.00 this year and yet still to receive an issue even though it says by Augest17 that is still too long.
2,Like a box of CrackerJack without the prize...,"This is a perfectly good magazine, in fact its very informative and fun -- lots of good game information and items about the X-Box hardware. But the demo disc is a very important addition. It is the best way to sample games before you spend your hard-earned money on them.Get the subscription WITH the disc..."
5,Be careful,"Be careful before you buy this. If you are wanting the demo discs with it then this is not it. This subscription does not include the demo discs, but it is a good strictly xbox magazine. If you want the demo discs go to the xbox website to order."
2,Awaiing First Issue,"Like others have said, the magazine subscription was bought in May 31st and have not received one issue. When I looked at my order history it said, ""First Issue Delivery Estimate: July 11, 2010 - August 08, 2010""...so I'll change this review in a few days if I have still yet to receive the magazine. As far as the product, you cant beat this price for a yr subscription w/ DVD!EDIT: My order status is now ""Shipped - Delivery Estimate: August 17, 2010"". I'll give it until the end of the month before I go bat-ssshhhh--crazy."
4,Great value part 2!!!,"Once again, you can't beat the price. However, the wait is terrible. At least with this mag I will get a DVD of demos."
5,Excellent Xbox360 Magazine,"I've been reading this magazine for the past 3 years and recently found a good deal on Amazon for 2 more years!This is my favorite Xbox360 gaming magazine. They discuss retail games and XBLA (Xbox Live Arcade) games. Any news that happens in the Xbox360 world is discussed in here.The reviews help me decide what game I would enjoy playing more, since I am on a limited budget for buying new games.On top of the magazine, you get a DVD included filled with Demos, all the review scores (past AND present), and usually some extra bonus (like a free theme for your Xbox360)!I also listen to the free weekly podcast done by Ryan McCaffrey and Andy Bauman, which you can subscribe to on Itune's or Zune Marketplace by searching for OXM Podcast. You should give it a listen if you like the magazine!"
2,Just an OK Magazine,"This magazine is a below average magazine. It seems to definately be geared towards the younger crowd because pictures constitute about 80% of it. Reviews can range from an OK length to a couple of paragraphs with 1 1/2 of those paragraphs babling about some random thing. While many magazines promise something in the next issue and actually deliver it, this magazine does not deliver it 95% of the time making them very unreliable. Their reviews are also very biased and nowhere near objective. If one game has X and then another game has all X has and a couple of more features, the second game can still get a worse review. Although it is a 'fun' magazine, it is poorly written and laid out."
5,A good deal...,"Normally I hate magazine's, however, I got some ridiculous deal on this - something like $6 for a year. So I jumped on it. The demo discs that the magazine comes with are fun - but sometimes useless/uninteresting. The magazine itself has some great pictures and well written articles. I won't pay the $25 for a 1 year renewal, however, I will probably buy it through Amazon again when it goes on a random sale. Recommended."
2,Without a Disk too much price for it!!!,"I can't believe that a magazine like ""XBOX Official XBOX Magazine"" does not come with its disk. It's like buy a game without a manual. How can you test the games appearing on the magazine without its disk that it should came with it? Ask and pray, because if you buy this magazine it's because you really like Reading instead of playing XBOX games."
1,Whats the point?,"The whole point of this magazine is the Cover disk. I can get all the Xbox info I need from [website]- I just need the cover DVD for the samples of the games - right?Well, in this case, there is no cover disk."
1,What they fail to tell you...,Is that this magazine subscription does NOT include the monthly demo disc. (...)
3,Took Forever,"Bought the subscription in May 2010. Did not receive my first issue until late August 2010. I can't imagine that processing and shipping should take that long. Granted, I got a year subscription for $5 so I shouldn't complain too much."
1,It never came,"Waited at least 3 months since I first subscribed before I cancelled the subscription. The magazine never came even after I reported.Whatever. I subscribe to Game Informer now, which is probably loads better."
1,still have not received,I paid for this subscription on August 8 and as of September 11 still have not received. It should not take over a month to get a magazine script started!!
3,Okay...,"Idk i find myself not looking through these magazines anymore. They're kind of boring. I tend to read gamepro more often than not. But hey, the demo cds are a plus."
3,No demo disc?,"I wouldent reccomend buying this off Amazon because there is no demo disc. The deom disc is one of the best parts of the magazine and its not included here. There are new playable demos of the hottest new Xbox games on the disc, downloadable content and other cool stuff, yet you dont get it here. Anyway, the actual magazine info is good too. This is the offical source. The editors don't have really anything to do with Microsoft though. The features in this mag are the cover feature, reviews, previews,letters, Q&A, Xbox rumors, and maybe some other stuff too. The demo disc isnt the full part of the mag, and actual magazine is good. But you would want the demo. Who doesent want to play the games?"
4,a must have for xbox users,"this has great previews for upcoming games, lots of pictures, tons of cheats, and it has nothing but xbox, what more could you ask for"
2,Great but NO DISK!,Do not get this magazine w/out the disk!!! This is a really great mag but 80% of the reason for getting it is for the disk. ...
1,Still haven't received any issues,"Ordered my subscription on 5-31-10, it's now 8-20-10 and I still have not received a single issue yet. I sure would like to read the magazine that I paid for."
4,"Great mag but,","This magazine is very informative and well done. It's great but, if you want to take advantage of the it,order the mag that comes with the demo cd([amt] more a year). The cd provides previews and several playable demos so that you don't end up dropping [amt] on a game you hate."
2,Misrepresented,"Like the other reviewers have noted, the fine folks who first posted this item conveniently neglected to mention the disc wasn't included. Without it, the magazine is not worth the money."
1,Very bad customer service,"The magazine is very good, hurts so bad customer service that supports it. Pay my subscription in September and received my first issue in December 2010, it was okay, but the January 2011 never came, I wrote 2 times complaining and never responded. So cancel the subscription. I advise you to buy it in stores, do not subscribe."
1,Could review it if I ever get it...,"I ordered this magazine on July 26 and it is Sept 19 and I am still waiting to get it. According to Amazon the projected delivery date is now October 19. Can someone tell me why it takes 3 months to get this? I usually prefer to actually receive something when I spend my money. I understand when you order it says wait 6-8 weeks for delivery of magazines, but this is well beyond that window. Very frustrating!!!!!!"
2,A day late and a dollar short,"The mag is pretty good, although I think they rate games too high. My real complaint is that the magazine is always late!"
3,I was misled.,"When I ordered this magazine, my order was based on it having a review disk included. I placed the order mid-November, and received my first magazine on December 29, without a disk included.Other than the review disk being missing, the magazine is excellent. I cannot give the magazine a 5-star rating because of the missing disk, therefore, I will give it 3 stars."
1,Dont buy!!!,This subscription seems hairy!!! I have been getting OXM for years now but when it came time to resubscribe I happened to see this pretty amazing deal. Only thing is I think the magazine is sent to someone else's house first then its reshipped to me. The white box used by OXM has never had my name in it which is kinda strange. But the worst about the subscription is that I know OXM sends out demo disc with every issue well I have never received one! Leading me to believe that the seller must be taking them out of it before he ships the magazine to me! Its upsetting!
2,A good magazine.,"I have been a subscriber since the premier issue, and will continue to be a subscriber, because I feel it's the best XBox magazine their. Yet, at times I get bored with it's writing style. They don't make it that fun to read, sometimes its too silly to read, at other times it's written with too much depth, to where it bores you. Plus, it doesn't have any good features (special stories) in it, they are all stupid or boring, with the only good one being in the first issue (the one about the perfect XBox setup, and the XBox set-up quiz).Why two stars then? The reviews are actually well written, and are truthful, and I trust them. So, if all you want are interesting reviews, try this magazine, but if you want to know about other things without getting too bored, look elsewhere."
2,Print is dead,"This magazine order took a really really really long time to start showing up at my door. I've gotten two issues so far and the games on the CD are not anything you would ever be interested in and you can get better demos instantly through XBOX live anyway. The articles aren't that great and usually all things you already know about future games from reading websites on the internet. XBOX live has great video reviews too that by the time you get this mailed to you is all old news. Basically I was hoping that to compensate for the fact that they are mailing you something vs. instant info you get online they would have exclusive content, especially on the CD, but that's not the case."
1,Poor Service...,"I finally got my first issue, 86 days after I ordered and well past the estimated delivery date. I can understand problems that arise or unexpected delays but what makes matters worse is ZERO customer service support... I used amazon's message system to send the publisher a message 15 days ago and I never got any response or help. Sent another 4 days ago and I sent one to amazon customer service at the same time and as of yet no response from either. I guess the email support is just for show and they don't actually respond???Hopefully this has been sorted out now and come this time next year I will have actually received 12 issues because my start issue was supposedly August and the first issue I got was October. I would be a little more angry if I didn't only spend $5 even though I don't think the price I paid should matter, I couldn't imagine paying full price for this level of service anyway."
2,Still havn't gotten it!,"I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend in June and it still has not come. I complained to customer service and was told that it would be sent out right away.... still not here. I'd be happy if it would just show up in the mailbox, but it hasn't happened yet."
4,Disc minus mag,I've picked up one issue of this at the store and to be honest I wish I could just subscribe to just the disc that comes with the magazine. Sure the magazine is full of articles but why read when I could be playing on my Xbox 360. Added note. I'm really annoyed with this because I ordered a years subscription on May 30th and It won't ship until August 26th. I mean what do they have to do hand right each page.
3,"Xbox Kinect Magazine, damaged disc","For less than a cost of a $10 meal I was able to get a year subscription thanks to Amazon to Official XBOX Magazine, only first issue came with a demo disc howver it was damaged or unreadable so was unable to use it anyway. Hey thats less than $1 a magazine."
2,Not worth $5,"This magazine its not entertaining at all feels uninspired and boring i miss EGM. The good thing is that dosent have too many advertisings, took me some months to receive my first issue, after that the others haven't arrived in prompt time oh well, the magazine comes with a DVD including a demo, reviews and arcade old games. I cant recommend this magazine even for 5 dollars i spend, but this should be perfect for someone who dosent have xbox live or internet access."
2,"Okay for the weekend gamer, but..","If you love the physical aspect of magazines and you're a gamer who loves paging through and grabbing codes, reading up on the upcoming cons, the new devs, getting the monthly demo discs, and you like to read reviews and see screen shots, then this is a good buy.If you have a good working knowledge of how to use Google, are familiar with the gamer message forums and spend much time in XBox Live, you probably already know what's in the magazine before it's been released. This was a waste of money for me, the discs rarely were anything we wanted to play (demos on XBox Live were better) and the information about game release dates was stale before we even opened up the magazine."
3,Great BUT....,Ok look this Mag is great but the problem is that without the disk u miss out i mean they have contest and stuff that u cn only win if u have the disc they relate back and forth to the disc so if u dont care and want to save 10 bucks and get a ussles peice of paper then ok fine !! But don't come crying to me when can't do anything but read the disk!! besides if you have 25 then Go and get a subscribtion dercitly! THE MAGAZINE AND DISK LOVE EACH OTHER!
1,"No Issues, 5 Months of service.","I ordered this magazine subscription via amazon in March of this year, payment came out for subscription, and I have not received an issue thus far. Thats 5 months of having this subscription active and not a single issue. I've contacted the customer service via my magazine subscription page to no avail. They skirt around the issue by saying it must have been lost in the mail, or my local post master is being lazy, which for 5 months cannot be the case. I am extremely dissatisfied. I love this magazine, but with the service I'm receiving its not even worth the hassle. Might as well go to the store and buy the issue there for this amount of crap."
3,Only order if you are willing to wait forever to get it.,"I Got a deal on this for a game i pre-ordered $7, yet i still have not received it and its been 2 months. I dont know what issue will be sent, therefore i dont wanna pick up this months issue,then have the same one sent to me. i just hope after this starts it will be regularly month-month. the magazine itsself is not at all bad , little short but keeps me up to date all things x-box."
1,Never received my first issue,"I've ordered plenty of items from Amazon over the years and never once had a major problem until I ordered OXM. The blame falls squarely on the publisher, Future, not Amazon. I ordered at the beginning of June and have still not received my first issue a mere four months later. All this after numerous calls and e-mails to Future's abysmal customer service. Each time I was assured that everything was fine, and the magazine was on its way. I've since cancelled my subscription and am waiting for a refund from Future. Supposedly magazines are struggling, but you wouldn't know it from the way this one discards their customers. A truly pathetic display."
1,DON'T ORDER FROM AMAZON.,"I ordered this magazine subscription from amazon.com. Don't get me wrong, this is a great magazine, but amazon ruins it. They don't bother to mention that when you get this magazine subscription from amazon they don't bother to include the demo disk that is supposed to be included each month. I just got an email from them today telling me the demo disk would not be included so I immedietlly canceled my order and got a refund. I will order this magazine somewhere else this will give me what I pay for."
1,X Box Magazine,"Well I orderd this magazine January 23rd t is now April 1st and I have not seen one issue. So, I would have to give this produst a 1."
2,PC+INTERNET+WEBSITES+YOU=NO MONEY SPENT ON MAGAZINE SUBSCRIP,"SINCE I HAD MY PC,I HAVE BEEN WONDERING DO I REALLY NEED TO SPEND 19.95 ON A MAGAZINE?SERIOUSLY,I DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE YOU DO GET MORE FROM THE WEB SITES AND YOU CAN PLAY DEMOS. IT'S YOUR CHOICE BUT ME, I'D RATHER SPEND TIME ON THE WEB THAN WAIT A WHOLE MONTH FOR ONE MAGAZINE. I WAS GOING TO GET A XBOX MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION BUT WITHOUT A DISC, IFEEL LIKE I'M GETTING PLAYED WITH."
5,My All-Time Favorite Garden Design Book,"Of the too many gardening books I've purchased, this one has transformed me. It opened my eyes to plant groupings that are natural (often native) and pleasing the year round. The illustrations are very beautiful and really do convey what Kingsbury describes. There is also plenty of useful data to help identify the plants that suit each environment. I bought this years ago and continue to return to it for both inspiration and information."
2,This book is a repeat,"The reason for the low rating is because this book is a repeat of Mr Garrett's book,""Let's Talk Treasure Hunting"" which was first printed in 1992. Chapters and wording of ""Treasure Hunting for Fun and Profit is practically identical. If you buy either book, there is no need to buy the other. These books have some information on the technics of metal detecting, but is more focused in the end in describing the kind of metal detector to use which is the Garrett detector...which is a great metal detector!"
3,It was ok,"I bought this item as an entroductory instrument for meditation music. The condition of the instrument for the price is good except the notes are off. It takes a little bit of practice to play it and is very sensetive to movement, which changes the sound. All in all it is not bad for the price"
2,Don't assume anything,The kit did have all of the gaskets shown in the picture. It only consists of two main gaskets and one round one. That is all.
1,It leaks,My first impression of this was good. But two days after filling it all the oil had leaked out. I can find no reason for this as it was closed tightly and the gaskets looked in place. I don't recommend it.
4,I works for me,"I ordered this from California Tools and I got a defaced, non brand package, by the UPC code it looks like I got a Neiko one.I ordered one for me and works very well, I can pin point oil what needs and leaving everything else clean. I'm using it with Hopes #9 oil with very good oil placement control (for me). Instead of placing the tip of the applicator and then pressing the plunger, I form an oil drop in the tip of the needle and then apply the drop where I need it; I found this easier to do. This way I can see how much oil I'm applying and thanks to the long and thin needle I can see where I'm putting it (due to my eyesight, I use a magnifier lens). I keep the oiler horizontal inside a tool box wrapped in a paper napkin and no leaks.-1 Star because my original intention was to order three more as gifts after I tried the first one, but due to the packaging (that looks as it was a used second hand, that it wasn't), I will not."
2,Oiler pen,"I need an oiler pin in my tool box so I though I would give this a try, not knowing if it would work or not. We it didn't work very well."
4,Classic Whitney,"I've had the U.S. version for years, and I've always loved it, because of the way it captures Whitney in her prime, right before The Bodyguard soundtrack's release. As I'm listening to the Japanese version, I must say that the bonus tracks are great, and I want to let everyone know that the Japanese album version of the title track is different than the one that appears on the U.S. version, although I am unsure of the name of that remix. And just so it's on this page as well, the two bonus songs are ""Takin A Chance"" and ""Higher Love."""
4,A good read,"This is the first book I've read by Sarah Andrews, and I'll look for more. She does a great job of creating believable, complex characters, and the plot kept me engaged."
5,Pressing On,"After meeting and working with this wonderful woman, I knew I had to read her books. Her faith, determination and proven show of patience is exemplary. Her outlook on life is an inspiration to all. This particular book should be a MUST READ for all Jr. & High school young women."
5,facial cream,"Goes on easy, nongreasy. I can see and feel a difference. Lasts for a long time, only need small amount. Another great product from Olay."
2,Overpowering Fragrance,"In general, I like Olay's new products. I could never find out how this product would work for me over the long haul, since the overpowering fragrance makes my eyes swell, and exacerbates my asthma. If you have allegies or sensitivities, I'd recommending passing on this one, or waiting for a fragrance-free product."
2,More like a primer than a moisturizer - not for someone in their 20s,"I wanted to like this product because of all the reviews I read, however, after 4 days of using it I had to give up.I'm mid 20's, medium skin color, with combination skin (slightly acne prone).[Be careful with reviews, you don't know what type of skin people have, so it could work for one person but not the other solely based on their skin type.]I used this in the morning and at night, and these are the cons:1. Clogged my pores! My forehead broke out, and that's very uncommon for me.2. The smell is terrible. Moisturizer doesn't need to be so strongly perfumed.3. The skin on my nose dried out and became flakyIf you're in your 20's, and have combination skin, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Misleading reviews,"Be cautious of the reviews here--many are posted from the Olay web site, where not a single negative review exists. (Even one as bold as to claim a Sephora employee commented that everyone she questioned with beautiful skin attributed it to Olay.) Blogs elsewhere have more objective, varied reviews, and I strongly recommend researching those before purchasing. No skin care product works perfectly for every consumer, and this item is no different. While I appreciate the light, whipped feel and subtle scent, the ""luminosity"" in the cream cakes into the few fine lines I have (I'm 27). After applying it, my husband thinks I have dry skin flaking on my face. Overall, the product is mid-range for me, but I am offended by Olay's attempt to mislead consumers with fake reviews, as I rely on honest consumer reviews to help me make informed purchases. As a result, I will not again purchase skin care products from Oil of Olay or its parent company, Proctor & Gamble."
1,MADE ME SICK!,"I was really exited to try this product after reading the reviews. It goes on smoothly and doesn't feel heavy but I was immediately struck down by the horrible stench of the ""fragrance"". It smells like the most horrible cheap perfume you could ever imagine. Unfortunately the odor does not dissipate as you would expect. Why produce a working product for only the smallest percentage of women who prefer a call-girl aroma? Another reviewer stated it was a cucumber-y scent but please be aware that this is like a strong cheap imitation of a heavy designer scent. I made both me and my Mom very nauseous."
1,Demons? Where?,"This movie is by far the worst thing I have ever watched. Lets go through some of the problems here:1) Acting...There really isn't any...2) Plot...What plot?3) Same scene...seriously how many times can you show the SAME EXACT scene in a movie? I think they had the RV driving down the street scene 10 times...4) The ""demon child"" made an annoying crying noise that never stopped5) The script...I don't think they made one and I quote a line from this crap ""Probably older than time"" I MEAN COME ON!This list could go on. But for the love of god do not even waste your time or money on this"
2,Ok.,This movie wasn't exactly what I had expected. The Demon Child looks nothing like the picture on the cover. I guess people have different opinions.
4,Good Machine,"Honestly, a very good machine. Besides starting out with a great amount of options, (DVD, CDRW, 256MG ram), the chip is overclockable to 1.5GHTZ easily. Plus, the chip can be upgraded to PIII. A very good machine for the price. If you're looking for a lowend machine with midrange possibilities, pick it up!"
3,Good Computer bad buy,I bought this computer in January of 2002. I have had so many problems with it. Every time I would call up compaq I would wait 2-6 hours just to talk to a support specialist then they would transfer me and again i would wait an additional 1-6 hours. I don't have the patience to wait and if you don't have 10 hours a month to wait on hold with compaq don't buy a compaq.
2,headache computer,"I bought this PC in November 2001, and this one just worked efficiently and normally 12 months beyond the warranty.since then the harddrive failed to boot and i lost tons of valuable data.i also replaced the pd card because the software broke and not available from the manufacturer anymore. the floppy drive broke later.right now the power switch failed so that i have let power the computer on in case i will not turn on.what a saving pc i have. great price great computer."
2,Never made me care what was going to happen next,"Simon gets involved when an old friend of Deborah's is charged with murder.Not up to the usual standard of this series at all. George ordinarily skips around between several storylines, but this one flat-out had too many for me to follow, and none of them were interesting enough to overcome that handicap. I quit about 100 pages in because George never made me care what was going to happen next - very unusual!"
4,A good book for a foggy afternoon (or several),"First off, 500 pages is too long for a murder mystery. Having said that, this one is pretty good. I never figured out who the perp was til the very end, and I was surprised. I enjoyed the Channel Island setting and the secrets held by the islanders were intriguing. The plot and mystery were very good. The characters were a mixed bag. Deborah, the star of the show, was a jerk from beginning to end, especially the ""you never understood me"" speech in the middle of a stake out. Sheesh! The most admirable characters were Ruth-the-Sister and Taboo-the-dog. Actually, of all the characters, I liked Taboo the best. The ending was surprising and to be honest, didn't entirely make sense. But it was a page-turner!"
3,A Place of Hiding,"Elizabeth George is a prolific and very popular author. I'd recently read With No One As A Witness and found it very well written. Then I tried to read What Came Before He Shot Her and I couldn't get into it. A Place of Hiding is somewhere in the middle of these two books. Deborah and Simon St. James are summoned to Guernsey in the Channel Islands to act as detectives because Deborah's friend, China, has been arrested for the murder of a philandering philantrophist named Guy Brouard. She and her brother, Cheyenne, were hired as couriers to deliver a package from California to Guy Brouard. The book seems to go on too long with two many sub-plots. The setting in Guernsey in the Channel Islands did add interest, but overall this is not one of her best."
3,"Good, but not her best.","I've read all of Elizabeth George's books and I love most of them. She is a wonderful storyteller. A Place of Hiding was enjoyable and I would recommend it. However, it wasn't my favorite, and I wasn't as riveted by it as I was with her last one, A Traitor to Memory. This was middle-of-the-road for me. The tension between Simon and Deborah seemed too much and not in keeping with George's prior stories. Deborah seemed too moody and I actually felt bad for Simon. I missed having Thomas in the story--he's my favorite. Some clues in the story's mystery were confusing and weren't really explained in full, even in the end. And I agree with a previous reviewer that there were too many unnecessary characters."
3,George is always good but...,"This one didn't hold my interest although it was well-crafted. The tension between Deborah and Simon seemed manufactured, merely a mechanism by which to add drama to the relationship between the protagonists and lend Deborah some affinity with her California friend, China. But then I've never found Deborah and Simon to be as well-fleshed out as other characters in George's books. It's funny but in her later books it's almost like she's more interested in the peripheral characters, the ones that will appear only in this book, than in her ongoing characters."
3,Please go back to Lynley and Havers!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very good book. But the main characters (Simon and his wife) are not as interesting as Lynley and Havers. Besides I waited more than a year for this book because I wanted to know what was going to happen with Barbara and her neighbors just to find out that she is not mentioned in this new book in the series.I hope George goes back to the characters that really characterize this series in her next book!"
4,Not Bad at All,"As several other reviewers have noted, Simon-and-Deborah are nowhere near as much fun as Lynley-and-Havers: The St. Jameses really are awfully annoying (they constantly call each other ""my love"", and they have more silly interpersonal issues in the week or two that this novel covers than most of us have in a lifetime). But the plot is a good one--not quite as difficult to keep straight as some of George's other novels-- the other characters are interesting and quite complex, and the setting, the English Channel island of Guernsey, is a spot I've never read much about, and George makes me want to go for a visit. I was sorry when the book ended."
1,Simon and Deborah go wild in Guernsey !,Oh dear -has Elizabeth George run out of stream ! - what a convuluted story with subplots that are neither interesting nor useful in helping us understand who murdered Gut Brouard. It was such a dissapointing end and I just wanted Lyneley to come over from London and save the day . Deborah and St James make such an unconvincing pair who clearly should not be at the helm in solving this murder - in fact by the end of the book I was hoping St James might murder Deborah who was making such a hash of protecting her friend China who stands accused of killing Mr Brouard!An awful plot that took so long to end - what a shame as i love her other books . I missed Havers and Linley .
1,DEB THE WHINER!!,"I have been an avid fan of Ms. George's book from the very beginning and can't believe this is her third bad book in a row.I never could stand Deb, everybody puts up with her whining and treats her like a spoiled child, well she does act like one. I like Simon and she was so mean to him in this book. The scene where she stalked away from him and he limped after her, in order to finish a conversation, really really made me see red! Get a grip lady!! You deserve a good spanking and start thinking of others instead of being so self centered, expecially your handicapped husband!!!!!!!!!BRING BACK TOMMY, HELEN AND HAVERS OR THIS WILL BE THE LAST BOOKI WASTE MY TIME ON!! I'm truly disappointed that one of my very favortie authors has let her fans down three times in a row."
2,Deliver us from Deborah!,"Thought it was only me that wanted to be rid of Deborah. She's a teeth-grating whiney act to take in small sub-plots - since she couldn't carry a tea tray, it's no mystery she couldn't carry this plot, such as it was. I doggedly read on, hoping that Deb would somehow be written out of future Georges -- alas, no. Nothing about her is believable or sympathtic - please, no more of her and her self-pitying blather."
1,Disappointing,"I loved every one of her prior books, so much so that I couldn't wait for the next one. Maybe if you remove all the interplay, soul searching and second guessing that goes on between Simon and Deborah the book would have been close to her usual storytelling. I felt like I was being prepared for these two characters to get a divorce. Certainly, if they bored each other as much as they bored me, divorce is where they are headed."
1,Poor showing,"Elizabeth George is generally a top-notch writer, but A Place of Hiding is an unfortunate exception. The plot was extremely disjointed, and so contrived that at the story's conclusion, very little of the set-up actually made logical sense. George's heretofore tight prose has given way to high school level analogy. Readers looking for the further adventures of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers will be disappointed to note that Lynley appears only peripherally, and Havers not at all. Simon & Deborah spearhead this investigation (most improbably), dragging with them the detritus of their marriage, a relationship which is now beyond boring.Truly a disappointment."
2,Less would have been more,"When Eliz. George is very good she is the best, but when she is wordy and unedited we all suffer. Surely, someone at her publishing house could have helped the author cut this book by one third. Not only because she become redundant and tedious, but because the flimsy plot does not bear the weight of so much verbiage. In fact, the plot does not really gel -- the pieces begin to come together -- until page 487. Even die-hard George fans are bound to find this one both too much and not enough."
5,Because of Tommy & Barbara,"I suspect the negative reviews of this book are because it does not include George's familiar characters of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers who have added so much to her previous mysteries. There is no doubt that this was written by Elizabeth George. It has all of the psychological depth of her previous novels. No one should have used the abridged recording to review this book. Yes, George's books are long, but that's what makes them complicated and worthwhile. This was not a boring book and the mystery was well handled. Contrary to what another reviewer said, there were not too many characters to deal with. All of the characters in the book helped to develop an awareness of the personality and motives of the murder victim. Don't pass up this book."
5,Elizabeth George Continues Going Strong!,"I bought A Place of Hiding in paperback and didn't read for a while as the reviews I had read weren't encouraging. I finally started reading it and am I ever glad. I enjoyed reading a story from the prospective of Simon St. James and Deborah and I became totally involved in the story and its twists and turns. Maybe it is a slightly different style than some of Ms. George's other books, but I admire an author who dares to try something even slightly different. I look forward to Ms. George's next book."
2,Disappointing,"I'm the sort of reader who must at all costs finish a book, once bought. I am struggling to do so with this one, and I've been a big fan of George. The plot is flat, the characters are flat, and the writing is flat. I get the feeling that George lost interest in this early on (assuming it was she who wrote it, it's far below the caliber of her earlier books). The main protagonists are cliche children of a cliche California tree hugger, Deborah and Simon St James are even more bland and excessively considerate of each other than usual, and everyone is in the throes of childhood traumas tenuously related to the plot (such as it is). And I don't particularly care what happens to any of them."
4,Involved and delicious read!,"Ahhh, we don't know the true culprit until the very end, and there are hints throughout, but they're so minor, one doesn't catch them easily. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will look forward to reading more by E. George. It's got a great bit of history attached, history to which I'm always interested in. I do hope you'll pick up this book, whether on tape or in paperback and give it a shot. It's quite delicious."
2,Elizabeth George's Latest--This fan is disappointed.,"As a great admirer of Elizabeth George novels, I was very disappointed in her latest effort. Too much description,too wordy, too much repetition. Overkill on the foreshadowing, Paul's rucksack for example--we got it already! When I did finally get interested in finding out ""whodunit"", it had taken too long to get there (well over halfway), and once the plot was revealed, it was quite lacking in logic and believeability.I will definitely try again. Hopefully, Ms. George will be back in form with her usually interesting and clever tales with witty and intelligent dialogue."
3,A Different Suspense Story,"As one who enjoys the mystery/suspense genre, I found this book to be a refrehing change of pace. Rather than hooking the reader with one twist after another, the writer takes the approach of a Fiction Writer. The book is lengthy and gains strength from the ability of the Author to develop locations and characters with numerous layers of believability. The length of the book coupled with its paucity of action may have led many reviewers to of this work in a negative manner. The Writer is an American yet this work is set on a British Island. Had I not read the biography, it would have seemed that a writer fom The British Isles had composed this work. She falls in love with her characters and their foibles a bit too frequently, yet this was found to a saisfying, although not page turning read."
3,No more Deborah,"A Place of Hiding was, as always with Elizabeth George novels, intriguing. The plot was well developed and the pace exciting. The mystery kept me guessing until near the end.However, the sections with Deborah and St. James were extremely difficult to read. Deborah was developed here as a childish, whining, irresponsible and boring ninny. The mystery is how did she ever get Inspector Lynley and St. James to fall in love with her? She was immature and annoying: doing ridiculous things and whining when her husband took issue with her often dangerous actions.I loved the story, enjoyed so much about it but will never buy another George novel that has Deborah as anything more than a bit player."
1,"Until reading her last three books, I was a fan of George.","This last book needs severe editing. The style is increasingly sef-indulgent, repetitive and muddy. I struggled with the confused syntax and clumsy metaphors. Various sections using changes in characters' voices and streams of consciousness makes A Place of Hiding almost unreadable. I tried following the story for a while because the setting (the island of Guernsey, occupied by the Nazis from 1940-43) interested me, but found myself skipping through the second half to find the conclusion. A deeper and more fulfilling treatment of the setting can be found in Tim Binding's novel, Lying with the Enemy, which I heartily recommend. This will be the last E. George book that I will open."
2,A Place of Hiding,"How sad that yet another Elizabeth George book just doesn't come up to the standard from her earlier books like ""A great Deliverance"" and ""Missing Joseph"". This book needed some serious editing since - it was way too long and full of meaningless minutiae. The characters were boring and the plot lacked the great mystery that we have come to expect for EG books. I don't undertand why Miss George insists on moving away from her successful characters of Lynley and Havers since these are the people that have made her books famous. Their characters are real and interesting unlike Simon and Deborah in ""A Place of Hiding"" I'm sorry to say that Deborah needs a kick up the pants - she is a spolit brat and Simon is a control freak, but none the less he doesn't deserve to be married to someone like Deborah.Come on Elizabeth, give us what we all want and write about Lynley and Havers again and don't feel you have to write 500 pages, 300 would be just fine!"
1,Not her best work,"I have been a fan of Elizabeth George for a long time, but her work is really uneven. This is one of her more poorly written efforts. Deborah St. James is as annoying as ever, and she is backed up by a cast of ridiculous and unpleasant characters including mercenary ex-wives, abused children, bullies, a creepy sleepwalker, deranged Nazi sympathizers, and so on. Skip it."
2,A Place of Hiding,"This book is enough to make me take a break from reading the Inspector Lynley series, which, up to now I'd been tearing through and enjoying very much. I find Deborah St. James to be a really annoying and uninteresting character--as another reviewer said, I kept telling her to ""just grow up""! And, unfortunately, she is the main character in this book. Nevertheless, I read to the end, hoping that my favorite person, Barbara Havers, would make an appearance. Hélas...Ms. Havers didn't show up at all."
1,Debs has got to go!!,"I so enjoy E.G. mysteries, but this was a real disappointment. Mainly I just can not stomach Debra St. James! Her character was so infuriating and pathetic and childish. I could hardly stay on the page when she appeared and found myself skimming pages to get past her. Ugh! The story was also quite slow and laborious in unfolding itself. Oh,well. Ms. George has never let me down before, so if this is the only one to do so, so be it."
4,Interesting Storyline,"Why some people do what they do is what, A Place of Hiding by Elizabeth George is all about. I found the characters, dialogue, and plot, intresting indeed...a very appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc.Beverly Hills, California"
1,A Place of Hiding,"I found this to be the most boring of Elizabeth George's novels.The characters were boring, the plot turgid and by the time I got to the end of it all I was past caring...Bring back Lynley and Havers!"
4,"It's not her best, but it's still really good.","Good writing, interesting plot, and I don't need to love every character. Definitely worth it!"
1,oh dear oh dear oh dear,No Barbara Havers. Poor plot construction. Ms George and I have come to a parting of the ways... I shall not be buying any more of her books.
4,For fans only,"If you're an Elizabeth George fan - and I am - this book is still a satisfying installment. But it's really just for fans, since it's relatively weak in plot."
4,not as good as some of her others,"The reasons for the solution to the murder didn't quite sit well with me. However, the book deserves 4 stars because--as usual--George has created fully-drawn characters, researched locales and background history, and brought the reader into the story with fine descriptive passages and subdued tension. George is the only mystery author, other than Daniel Silva, who has intrigued me enough to read all her books. I've still got 4 or 5 to go, but she consistently pleases me. In every book, her writing could be described as both ""commercial"" and ""literary"". That's an unusual accomplishment."
3,Some comments on Ms. George's writing,"Is it that Ms. George wishes the tantrums of the silly Deborah and the repetetive descriptions of the socially elite who regularly people her books to reveal the writer as an astute observer of human nature? If so, she does not succeed.George's vocabulary can be painfully pretentious, too; for example, in the current novel, she gives poverty-stricken Paul Fielder ""oleaginous"" hair. Why spend a dollar for that word, when fifty-cent 'oily' is so readily available and better fits the simplicity of the character?What is more important to this author, appearing erudite orcreating a good story? As many amazon.com reviewers have suggested, less may be more.George does achieve wonderful settings for armchair travelersand usually interesting plots."
1,Elizabeth George lets us down again!,"What's up with Elizabeth George? I used to love her books, but I was very disappointed in A TRAITOR TO MEMORY which should have been called A TRAITOR TO HER READERS. It was awful, but I bit the bullet and gave her another chance. A PLACE OF HIDING was the most convoluted mess I think I have ever read. There must have been 20 subplots, none of which were very interesting. Lynley and Havers were conspicuously absent and, deep down, I don't think Ms. George actually likes Deborah and Simon St. James. The whole mess went on for far too long and, frankly, toward the end, I didn't care who killed Guy Brouard. This may be the last time she suckers me into buying a book!"
2,Elizabeth George jumped the shark on this one..,"This book was disappointing, in a big way. Elizabeth George has picked her weaker characters, Simon and Deborah, and turns them into detectives to solve a peculiar murder. Unfortunately, the book focuses way too much on the fairly one-dimensional relationship between Simon and Deborah and not nearly enough on solving a mystery. Too much whiny soap opera and not nearly enough plot development. Although there's an explosive ending, the final resolution is way too gimmicky, and I feel that solving the case played second banana to Elizabeth George's attempt to show a really boring relationship from two sides.It's too bad, because Elizabeth George is ususally pretty good at throwing some plot twists and red herrings in. She also usually has a more interesting set of peripheral characters and suspects, who are quirky and fun, but here she just falls flat."
1,Simon & Deborah Go Home!,"Simon and Deborah have always been the least likeable characters in all of Elizabeth George's substantial mystery books. They should have never leaped from second string to main character. I can't finish this book. Deborah is such a despicably weak whiner I can't get past it to care who killed who. Simon needs some assertiveness training. Elizabeth needs an editor. She also needs to listen. Her fans have been clamoring for a Barbara Havers book from the get-go. The women in her books have always been too dependent on their men. Maybe Elizabeth's religous background is getting in the way of her mystery writing. This is the only explanation I can think of for creating such unsympathetic, suboordinate female characters. Look what happened to our beloved Barbara, the only independent woman in the entire series. I won't be buying any more books from Elizabeth."
1,Fan: Skip this one,"I read the reviews that wrote that Havers and Lynley were MIA in this book and the books main focus was on Deborah and Simon St. James - who are uninteresting characters in the best of times - but I refused to believe I waited like 2 years for a new Lynley George book and I got stuck with this! For shame Ms. George - to deprive your readers of one of the great mystery characters, especially a woman, to have come around in a long time. Hint: the PBS series is based on Havers and Lynley, not Deborah!!! Take my word for it George fans: skip this book as it might put you off for good!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I think it says it all when a reader whose favourite author is Elizabeth George can't finish this book. That's me. I have been really trying to go past half-way, where it was, actually, a struggle to get, for a couple of weeks and gave up. No need to analyse the reasons - just the fact that I had been amazed by most of her earlier novels (especially captivated by Deception in his Mind), put her up in my Favourite author box but couldn't read this one is enough. It could be the lack of Helen and Lynley and Barbara, it could be the setting that was depressing, it could be the length, but mostly, it was just boring. The characters were boring, not shallow nor undeveloped. They were simply not interesting. I just didn't care to find out why and how that person died. It's really such a pity, because Ms. George can do so much with her characters and has such a lovely style of writing. I don't know what happened here, but I'm so disappointed."
2,Blah!,"No Havers and Lynley and, as everyone has noted, Deborah and Simon St. James are uninteresting characters: she whines, he patronizes. The plot is pedestrian and, for George, uncharacteristically banal -- a terminally ill old ladies and her ammoral old rake of the brother, both victimized and permanently scarred by the Holocaust; Deborah and St. James scarred by insecurity and a bad automobile accident that left him crippled; Cherokee and China, victimized by their neglectful mother (a rabid environmentalist who abandoned them for the trees; a poor abused teenager -- I mean, even the little dog gets kicked around in this book.I am a fan of Elizabeth George and had eagerly awaited her new novel. While I can't call myself a victim -- I read it, after all -- I certainly feel neglected. Bring back Havers and Lynley! Bring back Helen!Unless you're a die-hard George fan (pun intended), you might do well to skip this one."
4,good Day vehicle,"Made to cash in on the big box-office profit generated by ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS and MY DREAM IS YOURS, Doris Day was re-teamed with Jack Carson for IT'S A GREAT FEELING.Featuring cameos by some of Warner Bros. biggest stars including Jane Wyman, Gary Cooper, Errol Flynn, Sydney Greenstreet, Patricia Neal, Eleanor Parker, Ronald Reagan and Edward G. Robinson, its a great big tunefest.Carson and Dennis Morgan play hotshot producers trying to get Doris Day into a movie career, with hilarious results! Highly recommended."
3,Great Day!,"One of the better WB vehicles for Day. Like Garland at MGM, Doris was frequently saddled with routine scripts and uninspired songs, but she's always wonderful, no matter the material. Here she has some fine Jule Styne tunes, pleasant company from Carson and Morgan, kidding their images, and fun cameos from everyone on the Warners lot. (The Crawford bit, complete with MILDRED PIERCE dialogue, is a particular hoot.) Highlight: Doris does an inspired sendup of every French canary you've ever heard in ""Cafe Rendezvous"". Like many David Butler flicks, looks like everyone had a great time making this picture. Relaxed, joky, very enjoyable."
2,Typical starfest,"Watch Dennis Morgan closely. He appears to be reading his lines off-camera. Doris does her best but it is the tragedy of her career that almost all her directors, save Hitchcock, pushed her into that over-the-top bubbliness. It sabotages her work for today's audiences: she becomes an annoyance quickly. Too bad. Best for the elderly."
2,Lacking Color,"I never would have purchased this book if I had realized there were so many black and white pages. Also, some of the rhymes were archaic."
1,Buyer Beware of the E-Book Edition of this!,"First it tries to sell you this book in 3 parts, because they claim it is TOO BIG TO DOWNLOAD. They really want THREE times the money. I truly believe it has nothing to do with download size.""Illustrations"" are awful and too blurry to appreciate, even when one zooms in.I did get my money back and got a free edition.You will notice a lot of the GOOD REVIEWS for this are for the HARDBACK edition. The hardcover is probably much nicer then this ebook.Don't fall for this ebook and the outragous price they want (x 3). This is my final warning..."
5,Classic Mother Goose,I read this book to my kids and am now reading it to my grand-daughter. Wonderful illustrations! The book has been so loved that it has started falling apart after 30 years. I would have never considered buying a different Mother Goose book.
5,Baby loves it,"My daughter loves this toy. She got it for Christmas. I didn't have batteries for it for a few days, but she played with it even without the sounds & lights. She loves the phone that hangs from it. I finally got batteries for it, and it kept her entertained quite a bit on our 11 hour trip to the beach. The remote came in handy. I'd just hit a button, & it would light up & play music for her while she was in her car seat. Highly recommend!!"
2,"A for effort, F for execution","I'm having the same problem described by other users: the program freezes during the pronuncation exercises, necessitating a reboot. This happens repeatedly, rendering the speech recognition feature of the software essentially unusable. In addition to this specific problem, the software is agonizingly slow when switching between lessons, and even between different portions of the same lesson. My computer is above the specs recommended by the manufacturer, so the problems appear to be due to poor programming. Bottom line: stay away from this product until it has been properly debugged."
2,This is not very good,"I was disappointed with this product. Navigation is poor and software does not work properly. Plus, you need to know some French in order to get anything out of it."
2,Would be good if it ran without freezing constantly,"This is a pretty good language course, as far as content goes, but it has one major problem - it freezes constantly.In the last hour that I've been using it, the program has frozen around a dozen times (not just temporarily, but permanently, requiring the program to be restarted). Always when it gets to the pronunciation exercises. Sometimes within seconds of restarting after the last freeze. Now presumably this doesn't happen on all computers, but I have a pretty good laptop (1.7GHz Pentium/512MB RAM, well above the recommended system requirements) and it's basically unusable (unless you avoid the speech exercises completely).When I pay this much for something I expect it to at least work properly."
1,"Dificult, slow cd reading,,, horrible","Dont ever buy this, I mean i bougth it with the intention in learning French for my first trip to Europe, but its a complicated software, hard to use, slow when u try to change to another level. I just wasted my cash on somenthing that doesnt work."
4,comprehensive for its' time,"I had this on my wish list for a long time as a present I wanted for my husband. As a rare book, it was pretty pricey, so when I saw it at a reasonable price I got it. He says it's good, but short, and he thinks he could write a better book about broad axes. (He's an expert on log-cabin construction, history, and renovation and has an impressive collection of primitive tools.) However, he states that he learned some things from this book, and is happy with his gift."
1,he cute but makes to much noies,the big big would bongo boogie snook he looks great and feel very soft but when he movies he makes loud sounds and when you hit the bongo nothing happen...
1,Bongo Boogie Snook Could Make You Snore...,"Like most people that will probably buy the Bongo Boogie Snook from Amazon I purchased it based on its ultra-low clearance (or mark-down) price. Let me just say, that this toy really isn't worth even affording precious toy box space to.The Snook plays a few different songs, but he's loud, annoying, repetitive and boring. My son played with him for a few days and he hasn't been played with hardly at all since then.You can check out my full review here:http://www99.epinions.com/review/Fisher_Price_Big_Big_World_Bongo_Boogie_Snook/content_429479530116"
4,We love this little guy,"My 15 month old loves his Snook. It does take a hard hit on the bongo to activate Snook, but we discovered if you lightly tap him on the head, it has the same effect as hitting the bongo. So we are having lots of fun with him. He is really soft too!"
5,What a fun and whimsical toy!,My daughter asked me to order this toy for her soon to be born first child. I had no idea what it would be like but I thoroughly enjoyed playing with it when it came. I can see that a baby would be very entertained by an adult or older child making it dance and talk.
4,My son loves this toy,"My two year old son is a big fan of Big Big World and he loves this toy. The only complaint I have is that the song Snook sings is repeatedly paused. The idea is that when the child hits the bongo, Snook sings another line from the song. Unfortunately, it takes a very hard hit on the bongo to be loud enough for Snook to respond. (Interestingly, he does respond to loud shouting.) My son usually resorts to just pressing the button again. Overall, this is a fun toy and any child who recognizes the character of Snook will enjoy it."
1,disapointed,"I thought it was the slicer,not just the blade I had gone by the picture and was there fore disapointed"
5,The angels in our lives--,"Angels have a habit of appearing at just the right moment and in the most unlikely of places. In the January/February 2008 issue Angels on Earth magazine these ""messengers"" (the word angel comes from the Greek word ""angelos"" which means messenger.) were spotted in a fancy French restaurant, on duty after Hurricane Katrina, and during a moment of weakness. In my own case, my Valentine Angel (pg 44) worked for the local utility company.Reading about the angelic encounters of others can give us hope in our own life. ""Every visible thing in this world,"" said St Augustine, ""is put under the charge of an angel."" Angels do exist and if you are open you will soon have your own story to share."
3,Different than I remember it tp be.,The stories are nice but when I receieved the first copy I thought it was a small catalog. I know it was never as large as other magazines but its really small. Its not a bad magazine but I won't be reordering.
2,Too small for the price,"I bought it because my son loves Pokemon, and there is no other option.Too small for the price. At least, there should be a special offer buying several figures."
4,Historical fiction,"We did enjoy this movie and have watched it more than once. The suspense part was good, too. And of course, it leaves you wondering if there should have been a continued story for what the soldiers would do next."
1,Selleck war film..early,"I have always been a great fan of Tom Selleck, but this film was really BAD....I could not even get through the first half hour.....It is no wonder no one has heard of this terrible endeavor of Selleck's. Maybe he should buy up all the copies of this and burn them. He was dreadfully mis-cast.....ugh!"
2,Sad to see on DVD,"They put this low budget, poor excuse for a made for TV movie on DVD? Where is Lassiter? Where is High Road to China? Who makes these choices? I like Selleck movies, but stock clips poorly mixed with back lot (room, lot would be too lofty) scenes complete with learning the trade acting. Did I really give it 2 stars. I guess I really do like TS movies."
3,Not Tom Selleck's best movie,"First of all the music is really bad.The one fellow in 1940 France calls the Tom Selleck character ""Gung Ho""which comes from a 1942 Marine movie ?Some of the props in the biology lab are just there by""time travel' with plastics and electronics not seem until the 1980's.I have no idea if France ever had a secret biologicallab, but if it did, it would have been very nearParis?In short the acting may be better than the script writing,producing and directing here?Missions like this weren't organized until later in the warand were mostly carried out by British commandos under the OSS?The art work in contrast to the music is very well done."
1,The Gypsy Warriors - Don't waste your money,"I like Tom Selleck, but this movie is very poor. If you look closely at one of the night scenes, you can see the World Trade Center - the two towers - in the back ground. Duh! The towers were not around during WWII."
1,Disappointing,"One of Tom Sellecks earlier movies and was disappointing, after you watch him in Jesse Stone you wouldn't bother with this attempt."
3,It's Tom Selleck!,"As one other reviewer stated, it's Tom Selleck. The quality of the movie is not that great and there is a lot of night stuff, so it's hard to see what's going on. The story is ok because it is eliminating some Nazis. It's one of those movies you see once and that will probably do you for a lifetime."
1,Tom Selleck movies,Didn't like this one bit. Only saving grace was that Tom was in it. Story was contrived and a little stupid. Don't even bother with it.
1,Dave,The worst war movie ever filmed and I'm sure one Tom Selleck (one of my very favorite actors) wishes he'd never done. I only gave it one star because I could not rate it with none. A true STINKER!!!
1,Be Careful,"I was expecting to receive final ball based on description and picture(The Jo'bulani) I was sent the Jabulani. The only difference is the color scheme, but beware if you're expecting ball listed."
1,AWFUL AND STINKY,"I bought these thinking that I could not go wrong buying strawberry incense because I had never found one I didn't like. Needless to say, this is the first. It does not smell like strawberries and I had a fire on it for about five minutes before I gave up trying to keep them lit. They do not burn well if at all and I have not managed to get one to burn. Bought fresa incense in bulk and it was by far better than this product. If you want your house to smell like its burning down asbestos, or you want to spend a night sitting and trying to keep it lit, then this is the product you are looking for. If you want nice incense, then I would save yourself the trouble. Never buying again."
1,Brown watery peppered sauce,"This sauce will not thicken after fatefully following the directions on the package,results is a brown peppered water."
5,Beautiful photographs of the best place on Earth!!!,"I am a proud Jersey Girl, and I have been going ""down the shore"" every summer since I was a small child. This books wondefully captures the very essence of the shore...all of the things that make it unique; all of the things that make it beautiful; all of the reasons why it is so magical. This is a fantasic book--with unbeatable pictures of the best place on Earth! The essays and quotes that are included also add to the experience. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the Jersey Shore! It is a little expensive, but worth every penny!"
3,It would have been perfect but...,I love the cart! I'm using it as a TV stand. The only concern that I had was the box that it was in apparently got wet before it was sent to me. Some of the pieces were swollen and green with mold. I cleaned them off the best I could and put it together. The screws were difficult to put in the swollen pieces. It is very stable though and looks great (the green pieces are inside and were covered).
2,Missing Part...Sent Back,"I had hired a carpenter for the day..to put together items purchased for new house. He spent about an hour assembling the cart, then told me it was missing a side panel. Wasted an hour of his time and my money.Contacted Lorell at their 1-888 number and told they only stocked hardware and that I should contact Amazon.Amazon to the rescue. A very nice series of tech support folks arranged for UPS pick-up and re-routing of previous address. Refund to credit.Looked like a substantial cart. Too bad I won't do business with Lorell again."
5,Newsies Soundtrack,I am a HUGE fan of the Newsies! I watched the video at least a hundred times! I love the soundtrack! Every song on it is inspirational and so well written!
5,Best soundtrack since Grease!,"The soundtrack along with the movie are some of the best works since the all-loved movie Grease. The singers are fabulous and the movie compelling. It makes you want to jump up and dance and sing along. This is a cd I have been looking for forever, and as soon as its in stock I am going to buy it. It is a must-hear cd to go along with a must-see movie."
4,Great way to get your sons to enjoy a musical,This audio product as well as the DVD is great for kids. My son watched this in his 6th grade History class and just loved it. The fact that my family was from the lower eastside of Manhattan made it even more enjoyable to him especially since his Great Grandfather was a newsie! I highly recommend it.
5,great spirited music,"I think the music on this cd is highly unique even for a musical. Energetic and/or Inspirational are the keywords, for most of the songs, that is. A couple of them are very mellow. The highly visible theme focuses on people stepping up and uniting themselves to overcome injustices. Achieving your dreams is perhaps another theme. Of course there may more themes but we'll leave that up to opinion. I believe most of the singing is done my male voices since the newsies are males in the movie, perhaps one of the unique things about this. Their voices are excellent and they harmonize so well for a perhaps somewhat large choir of its kind. They sound very good in my opinion and have a unique appeal. I think that about sums it up."
5,Great Movie,"This is , personally one of my faves. First I didn't think I would like it so much, but when I gave it a chance, it became 1 of my favrite movies. It has really cool dancing songs, and its hilarious. The Newsies are a group of kids(some orphans) who sell newspapers in New York in the early 1900's. They decide to go on strike because the price for the newpapers get raised. This affects the Newsies because they have to pay for their own papes. They never give up, and they stick together through all the tough times they go through. All the actors are great. This is a great movies, I reccommend it for any age."
5,TEENAGERS WITH SOME MORAL VALUE WILL LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK!,"My name is Megan and I'm 14 years old. I first saw the movie Newsies about a year ago, and I think it's the best thing in the world! The soundtrack is the next-best thing in the entire world! (Welcome to the Newsies Cult) Even though this soundtrack is not very high-quality (give them a break, it was made a while back) compared to some other CD's of today, it's a DEFINATE MUST-GET! I am a Christian and I like to consider myself having more morals than most kids my age. If you want a soundtrack that is G-rated and still VERY good and not ""nerdy"", this is definately it! (Naturally, your DMX-liking friends will laugh, but who cares about them?) And always rememeber: NEWSIES IS NOT ""JUST A MOVIE/SOUNDTRACK"": IT IS A WAY OF LIFE!!!!!!"
5,you'll find yourself whistling along,"This is a fabulous cd! The tunes are catchy and get into your head, but you don't seem to mind. The range of the cd is incredible, scaling from soft and nostalgic to toe-tapping fun. A must for the musical lover."
4,"Oh, the memories...","Thank heavens this CD has been released again! When it first came out, many many years ago, I had to buy my copy of the soundtrack in Walt Disney World because I couldn't find it anywhere else!! I ended up buying both the CD and the cassette since it was not in print anywhere. Years and years later, I have no idea where the CD is, and my sisters and I wore out the cassette. So needless to say, seeing that it is once again in print is great! The movie may not have gotten the greatest reviews, but I loved it, and enjoy watching my very worn out copy of it time and time again. So kudos to Disney for releasing this one!"
4,Excellent Soundtrack just in time,"NEWSIES is a fun soundtrack - a strange hybrid of prototypical boy band harmony to some turn-of-the-century Gershwin-influenced orchestral numbers. I think it's great that after almost 10 years, NEWSIES is still so popular, earning a re-release on May 11th in Baltimore and Louisville! That's fan power!"
5,Newsies Soundtrack,"The musical Newsies was once of the best movies ever made, and had incredible songs. This soundtrack captures the spirit of the movie and makes a great companion for long trips in the car. If you don't own, buy it. I'd just like to comment though that the Trey Parker in the movie is NOT the same Trey Parker that created South Park. If any editors are to read this, could you please fix it?"
5,Luv Newsies!!!,"I absolutely love the soundtrack!!!! The songs are great (with a few exceptions), and I listen to it all the time. The songs are rather short and therefore end quickly and replaying them can get annoying. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you're a die-hard fan. The shortest song is like 2 minutes or even less."
5,My friend and I simply love it!,"My firend and I simple love it! Everytime she comes over we listen to the soundtrack, then watch the movie, then listen to the track again! We alwasy listen to it at partys, and we played Seize the Day, and King of New York, at our Graduation dance. Now the whole school loves it! It's so exzilerating and up lifting to listen to. I play it when I'm feeling down, or just for the fun of it!"
5,SCORE!,"I absolutley love the movie and the soundtrack. All of the songs are fun and catchy. You will never get bored of this! They make you just want to dance (or maybe that is because I've seen the movie enough to know what dace steps they are doing) You should also see the movie! It's awesome! BUY IT! You will not regret it, the only problem is when you can't stop singing the songs."
5,I need this cd so bad it is the best soundtrack ever!,"Isn't there anyway someone can get me this cd, Newsies is my favorite movie ever and the music is awesome! How could you be out of stock? Please help me. If anyone can help to get me this cd I would be grateful because it is the best soundtrack!"
5,fantastic!,"One of the best Broadway Cds I have ever heard - must be a great show. Sound quality, music and album notes were great. I am amazed! This is even better than the movie. As always, service from Amazon was safe and speedy and the price was better than I thought it would be."
5,NEWSIES CD cast recording,"Great production for a cast CD ,vocals are clear and the orchestra is not buried in the background ,a great balance between the two ,not to mention the exciting tunes in this high energy show"
5,Newsies,"I bought this CD because I love the movie. I listen to the disk a lot and I must say the boys are extremly talented. I listen to the soundtrack when I need inspiration, which I always get. This is a good clean CD with a lot of vocal talent."
4,Great CD,"This Soundtrack is wonderful! I am happy to see it is being released again! I have it on tape, but now I can get it on CD! ..."
5,"Amazingly Superb, couldn't be any better!!!!!!","I've seen the movie and heard the sound track and I believe that it is one of the best cd's i've ever heard, even better than the Miseducation of Lorne Hill. All that I have to say is that it rocks!!"
5,FIVE STARS!! This is a GREAT soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is the best Disney soundtrack I have ever heard! If you liked the movie, you'll love the songs. With show stoppers like ""King of New York"", ""Sante Fe"" and ""Carrying the Banner"", you're bound to love it! And at $14.39, you can afford it too! This soundtrack is amazing. It has every type of music you could ask for. Dramatic (""Sante Fe""), inspirational (""Carrying the Banner""), and just plain fun songs (""My Lovey, Dovey Baby"" sung by Ann-Margret). ""Big, bright, rousing!"" raves the Los Angeles Times. The music from the story of a courageous group of newsboys is definitely a smash hit!"
5,The Best. And that's FINAL!,"Great actors and actresses! Great plot. Awesome music. Makes you want to see it again and again! Dancing was performed wonderfully! I was amazed! Thw hard work payed off. They deserve 5 stars and I'm giving it to them *****! If you haven't seen it, MAN are you missing out on something good!"
5,"LOVE ""Newsies"" :)",So excited that there's a soundtrack from this amazing show! I saw it front and center orchestra seats back in July and every time I listen to the soundtrack I can see them singing and dancing in stage! :)
5,It's great!,"I love this cd, along with the movie. I think that all of the characters should be commended on their musical talent, expecialy Christian Bale. This cd brings me joy everytime i hear it and i'm even using one of the songs for my gymnastics routine! I would like to thank all of the people that worked together to make this movie and its cd come to."
2,Filter please...filter,"I'm an unabashed fan and collector of all things Pollard. Despite his incessant churning out of amazing pop tunes, there's plenty of swill to take the most avid fan aback. Even then...every release has something on it that makes the purchase necessary. For the 1st time I can say that this is simply not the case. The music is good (at times), but the VHS turned DVD is just bad. This DVD is not worth $5. Netflix exists for a reason kids. Save your money for the next Boston Spaceships LP. This is not worth the scratch, nor the time you'll spend fast forwarding."
3,"Pretty shoe, but made for narrow feet","This is a gorgeous shoe, but it is made for someone with a narrower foot. I have a medium width foot, and don't usually have a problem with medium width shoes, but these shoes killed me! I wore them for a short while and was in severe pain from the very thin and tight straps."
3,Not to learn 3D,I am more then half way threw this book and have found very little to help learn Java3D. Instead it looks at strategies and goes threw a long-winded discussions about basic issues. So I believe if you are new to Java3D it will be no use to you or if you have experience it will be a boor.
1,Not a Practical Book,"This book is full of theories about 3D worlds and Java 3D. Lacking a lot of code description i.e. The author doesnt even go through his own source samples provided in the book, describing what the code will do. (If u want to do PHD in 3D interface maybe this book will help, but definetely not much use for developers)The only good thing is that you have a lot of source code as samples and will have to explore yourself how he is doing different things in that code.And with that price, I think atleast a CD-ROM should have been included.Very disappointed with this book."
5,Incredible resource,"I am reordering this book because the copy I bought fifteen years ago is worn out.Lee gently teaches the practice of praying with scriptures and offers a biblical reference for any issue, emotion or interest the reader may have.It is a classic in my library."
5,LECTIO,This book is a life changer and a life saver-----who knew prayer could be so simple and effective.Cannot recommend this highly enough----BUY IT NOW.
5,Jazz at it's best!,"Suede's crystal clear voiceand amazing range blend smoothly with David Pearl onpiano and Max Murray on bass. If you get a chance togo to a live show grab it, as they are phenomenal!"
2,"Nice toy, does not teach you Greek","This product is very different from e.g. ""Learn to speak French"". It does not teach you basic Greek. It will teach you, pleasantly, to say some words and phrases. That's it.If you are pleased to be able to say ""Good morning"", ""Thank you"" and ""May I have the bill, please"" in the local lingo, go ahead and enjoy. If you want to understand any reply, you need more than this. If you just want to get around, a very, very thin printed parlor will serve you better and more reliably."
4,Really helped!,"I have bronchitis and my doctor gave me an antibiotic and recommended Robitussin DM. I can finally sleep through the night. I have been taking a bit more than recommended on the label because I waited 2 weeks to go to the doctor, so my cough is VERY bad. I would highly recommend to anyone with a bad cough and chest congestion."
1,not good,"Unfortunately for me, Robitussin DM didn't do a thing to take away my really bad cough--in fact, this didn't even take the edge off my cough when I caught a virus a few days ago. I was even taking a little bit extra than the directions indicated!I would say that if you're really sick you might want to keep looking for another over the counter cough syrup or, perhaps better yet, go to your doctor and get a prescription cough syrup. Robitussin DM may only work for some people who have a rather mild cough. This product is certainly nothing special!"
1,Very annoyed,"The bottle arrived and it expires within 2 months. That is ridiculous. The single dose packets included expire in one month. I wish I had just gone to CVS and bought one there, since I will have to throw out 90% of this bottle of cough syrup since I won't use it in time."
5,Disco done right!,"KC & the Sunshine Band was the best band of the Disco era. Songs like That's the Way I Like It, Shake Your Booty, Get Down Tonight, and many many more are all here. I liked Disco but not everyone could do it well, KC was the expection. Great, timeless music - buy it today and do a little dance, make a little love..."
5,The way I like it,"Go ahead and snicker all you like at the song list, music snobs, but just try to stand still when ""Shotgun Shuffle"" is playing. You won't be able to. There's a reason why this music is still popular today: enthusiasm and great musicianship."
4,That's The Way I Like it,"If you feel like Shake, Shake, Shakin' or Gettin' Down Tonight then let your backbone slip with KC + The Sunshine Band!You know the music, you know the songs - they bring up your mood!My only problem - some of the songs aren't high energy, Top Ten quality. But, so what? Just skip 'um!"
5,1 of the best.,"This album is 1 of the best in the 70's. Whatever I listen to it I don't ger bored, specially songs like ""Thant's the way I like it"" because the name of the song describes it self."
4,I like it,"KC and the Sunshine Band were the most successful disco group of the 1970s. They produced a lot of fun records. The songs didn't have any serious messages, but they had a lot of charm. This is just good time, get up, shake your booty and dance music. This CD contains all their big hits and some songs that weren't big hits, but should have been. I would recommend this CD to anybody who is a fan of disco."
1,The Best of KC & the Sunshine Band,"It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original. My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered. Don't order this product."
3,Add Some Sunshine To Your Party,"KC and The Sunshine Band will always be rembered for some funky upbeat disco hits. This greatest hits collection features such classics as Shake Your Booty, Thats The Way I Like It, Give It Up, Get Down Tonight, and Keep It Comming Love. There are few surprising lesser known tunes such as Sound Your Funky Horn and Please Don't Go.However, most of the sixteen songs sound the same with very little trace of variety. That can be overlooked somewhat if you are dancing up a storm. However as musicians the band just does not distinguish itself outside of a few captivating rhythms. The songs are good but the lyrics are oh so basic.Yes, KC and the Sunshine Band is good if you want to go party and disco dancing. But somehow there are many bands of varying styles that will rank ahead of these guys when people remember the seventies. Still, these tunes will add some sunshine to a funky party."
4,happy childhood,A song came on the radio the other day and my son liked it and the wife couldn’t figure out who it was. I started thinking about the other songs from back in the day. It reminded me of my adolescence and put a smile on my face.
2,Ok.. not great,The first two remixes are the best in my opinion.. don't care for the Pleasure remix. I like techno & hip hop but I think some better DJ's should take a crack at Billie's songs.
2,It's different - BE CAREFUL!,"I had previously purchased Cosamin DS. It came in capsule form, and contained both Vitamin C and Manganese. To my great surprise - and disappointment - this product was in tablet form (although the packaging was solid, several tablets arrived broken), and contained neither Vitamin C nor manganese. Had I known, I would not have purchased this product from this seller."
4,Me and the Dog,"I started taking these at the strong suggestion of a physician treating me for a back injury. I am definitely feeling better, although I can't be certain whether it is a result of the glucosamine or the exercises I've been doing. But they certainly didn't hurt, and being a food supplement, rather than a medication, I understand there to be little risk of adverse side effects. My doc was emphatic about the benefit of this product. The same company makes a canine version, and the change in my Labrador after taking these was quite dramatic - helped him greatly."
2,The chosen One,"The Chosen one was a very interesting book . But it only told about Tiger Wood's career and his life when he was older , getting into golf tornments and training . But otherwise it is a very good book if you were just wanting to know how he won tournments and becomeing famous . Also it told about how Tiger Woods was ridiculed by his race and how young he was , which was a problem towards his career due to reporters and newspapers.Tiger was also known as one of the multicultrual icons . Also what was interesting to people is Tiger was guided by his father rather than being pushed on."
2,Has some gems,"A collection of few chapters with the authors own ideas and thoughts thrown in too liberally, it is more of the author's view of Tiger Woods. Does not qualify as an biography, just a bunch of articles. Does has a few gems which make it worthwhile."
3,fine for my needs,"This book was pretty banged up when I received it, but it served it's purpose for a short class."
5,It's a shame it's out of stock,"This was the album that got me into xmtpw.This album is cool because it's structured so smooth. I think that if you don't own it to start looking in hack shops just incase,you might get lucky."
2,Not the best bang for the buck.,"The photos in this book are not exclusive, as they can be found in many other books and magazines. It is certainly a better value than ""dream home"" magazines that usually sell for $7 a pop at the newstands, but it pales in comparison to ""Dan Sater's Luxury Home Plans"". Sater's book is better in just about every way... larger format, larger pictures, thicker paper, a better selection of homes in my opinion (not to mention a few identical ones), and a lower price.You probably already know that the purpose of these books is to sell home plans. That's why they're so cheap. From a consumer standpoint, they're fun to browse through and you don't feel any buyer's remorse since you can easily spend more money at McDonald's.If you're looking for a book to get valuable ideas for your next home or remodel, take a look at ""Home by Design"" by Sarah Susanka."
2,Master Bedrooms on First Floor,"I was disappointed because the majority of the plans in this book have the master bedroom on the ground floor. I've purchased 5 different new-build houses in the suburbs of NYC, Chicago and London and never come across a home with the master on the ground floor. Two realtor friends tell me they are unusual and difficult to resell unless in a retirement community. If you're looking for a ground floor master you'll probably find the book useful but anyone building a traditional house will probably be disappointed as I was."
5,Never Go With Strangers,Never Go With Strangers is an excellent book. The book is a helpful tool for parents who want to teach their children the importance of safety when dealing with strangers. In todays society this book is a must have. I strongly recommend this book for parents.
2,Birds don't like it,"I purchased 3 different squirrel proof suet feeders from Amazon, and two were a huge success. This one, however, gets very little action. I'm not sure what is so different about it, but the birds don't seem to like it. They eat from it only if the others are empty.If you live an a flying squirrel area, be aware that they seem to be able to get into anything. I discourage them by adding red pepper to the suet cakes I make. The birds don't care, and it is supposed to be good for them. I find they overwhelmingly prefer home-made peanut butter/lard/corn/oatmeal/flour cakes over anything I buy."
3,not for me,"Would by again from Amazon. They product is always as advertised, packaged and mailed on time. I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."
4,Tempting,The book is good along with the storyline. There's just the right amount of sex in the book. I think the story has good potential. The ending could be better but i also feel it goes well with what she was trying to get across. I hope in the second book the two former lovers get back together. Cute overall.
2,I didn't finish reading...,"I'm sorry, but I must have missed that this was an ""erotic"" book. This is not my type of book. I just looked at the number of good ratings, and I thought it would be a great book. I couldn't finish the book. When I started blushing in the 1st chapter, I knew I may not want to keep reading. Are you kidding me? Where is the story? It was almost like reading a recent LKH book, but it was worse. I really did not like the parts I finished. I would have given the book a 1 star, but I felt guilty."
2,"Premise has potential, but...Disappointing","The premise of people with animal DNA I thought had potential for interesting differences and conflicts. Having read and enjoyed other paranormal and ""romantica"" novels, the reviews had me looking forward to this one. The main characters were attractive enough, and although the plot was fairly predictable the book's biggest disappointment was that the hot encounters between Callan and Merinus was so motivated by an overwhelming chemical dependency (via Callan's pheromones) that the sex was disturbingly and distractingly involuntary--like a drug addiction. If this sounds like it would bother you, look elsewhere."
2,"Hot scenes, Cheesy plot","I love me a good erotic scene but this book was not worth the $. Author repeated phrases, the plot was cheesy and complicated, and characters were one dimensional and forgettable. If you like this genre go for ""New Species"" Laurann Dohner instead!"
3,Not my cup of tea,"More sex than plot. Main characters' relationship is antagonistic until the very last part of the book when they (surprise) realize they are hopelessly in love. My response at the end was ""That was it?"""
4,Not for tame readers!,"This book will appeal to romance readers that like a good dose of naughty language, steamy sex, and alpha males. People who love Ward, Kenyon, Ione, Showalter, etc might want give these books a shot.I think this series has a lot of potential. It's a refreshing change from all the vampire stories that dominate paranormal romance shelves. There is not a build up of romance but an explosion of sex that might turn off some readers. I like my books hot, but they must have a storyline that keeps me interested. This fits the bill.Yes, there is a barb, and yes its a little strange. It is a breed series so I guess it's going to have something abnormal. Vampire series involve teeth, blood, and pain...yet I've never seen a review complaining it's not normal!"
3,Meh,"Meh. There was so much arguing and grandstanding and not much doing other than having sex until the end. I'd have to say the last 20% was my favorite and redeeming part of the entire book. It's sad that it took me so long to get interested -- if I wasn't a person who completes what she starts, I would have bailed on this book long before it got good. Or if all I wanted was soft core sex scenes. The book wasn't bad, it just wasn't great or what I expect from a long standing series."
5,Excellent Beginning!,"I had began the Breed books somewhere in the middle. I've gotten my sister-n-law and mother-in-law to reading these as well. We finally decided we had to see how it began, and Lora Leigh did NOT disappoint. Just as fantastic as every other one I've read!"
5,HOT & a story line!!!,"This is erotica. But it also has enough of a story line to keep you interested (not just sex scene after sex scene). I prefer books that have an even mix of story line to sex scenes. Endless sex scenes get boring (to me, at least). I'll definitely read the next book in this series!"
5,In the beginning,"Tempting the Beast (Feline Breeds, Book 1)Starting in the beginning is always best. I just love every one of her characters and since I first read a breed story have wanted to get to the beginning. While the first one is a short story at least this is the start of the ""lion breed"" storyline. Since the way these breeds were created is more science that paranormal they also fall into the science fiction catagory which is my favorite. I was hesitant at first to read something in the erotic romance catagory but this has given me a whole new place to look for my favorite genre. So if you are a science fiction lover give these books a chance. You'll get caught up in it."
5,Unbelievably HOT!!,"Geez...what to say...All I can say is this series is HOT HOT HOT. Good story, too. LOL :-)"
4,A Good Read,"Tempting the Beast sets a very interesting story line for the Feline series. It introduces the reader to the main pride and briefly outlines the difficult and interesting journey they have travelled so far. In very human terms it describes the struggle to understand the mating process and it's effect on the Callan and Merinus. It is fast paced, addictive and keeps the reader entertained. After reading this book, I purchased the others in the series."
5,I am Hooked on Breeds,This book was recommend to me by a friend.. Wow!! I was very surprised to the say the least.This is the story of Callan and Merinus. You are introduced to Callan who has been altered by scientist for thier evil purposes. But thier humanity still remains intact. This is a fight for survial for the Breeds. Merinus is a reporter seeking the truth or is it myth about these Breeds.Great sexual tension with Callan and Merinus. This is not your average romance this is erotica. I am now hooked on the breeds. I can not wait to find out what happens to the other Breeds..Great Job Ms. Leigh you now have another fan to add to your list.
1,I didn't care for this book,"This book didn't make that much sense to me as far as a plot goes. It was mainly pornography. I like steamy scenes as much as anybody but after a while, for me, the repeated sex got tiring. Merinus (not a very attractive name) was a contradiction. She claimed to be able to do the job of tracking down Callan Lyons and getting him to open up to her. She finally talks her stubborn brothers, who were major irritants, into letting her do this and then she proceeds to make so many blunders that it was hard to take her seriously. Perhaps this book wasn't the right one to read first as this is a series but the plot just wasn't there. There was a bit of disjointed story in between bouts of sex. I liked Callan but Merinus was also an irritant. There was just no meat to this story. If you like steamy sex scenes and plenty of them, then this is the book for you. If you like a plot too, then maybe this isn't one you'll enjoy."
1,Same Old Sex and Lacking Plot,I just didn't get this book. It was so boring. The sex in this book was the same old over and over except for maybe 1 scene. This book was more about the sex and the plot was put on the back burner. Merinus was all talk tough girl thinking if you call someone an a-hole that makes you tough. Callan was too dominant for me. Plus as a strong kick butt shapeshifter he actually thinks Merinus is tough?!? IMO she is tough on the nerves...This book just rubbed me the wrong way!
4,Good Read,This was a pretty good read. It kept me reading until the end. It had a good story and mega animalistic sex scenes.
4,Wow.,This book was intense! It is a great beginning for a awesome series. I feel like it was mostly sex but somehow Lora Leigh squeezed in a story that makes you want to jump right in the next book.
3,Well...,"Okay... This book is certainly not for the faint of heart.. Highly, I mean HIGHLY erotic. (This book made me Blush!) I had to put this book down several times. That being said, this book to me, did not start to become truly interesting until much much later in the book. The beginning and most well past the middle it was mainly about the erotica and ALPHA Male possessing his woman. Once you are able to get past this, then the book starts to balance itself out more with the emotional connection more so than the physical one with the main characters (although the physical is still very much there) & the plot of the story. I think this is a good lead into the other stories in this series, if not mainly just so you can know everyone involved and their place in this story. In my opinion it's not the best opening to a series, but it's not a waste of time for you to read either"
4,Good start to a series!,"I am a big fan of shifter stories. I thought the story was good. I liked the chemistry between Merinus and Callan.I will say the Merinus seems to handle the situation almost to well about being mated to a shifter, I thought that could have been a little better. Callan was good just the way he was. No excuses just did what came to him. Period. The secondary characters I felt were really good and Mrs. Leigh did an excellent job planting seeds for future stories that makes you want to read as fast as you can to get to them. I can't wait to get to Kane and Sherra's story as well as Dawn. As usually the sex was great. VERY HOT, no holds barred........"
1,BUYER BEWARE - Chinese Knockoffs ~ Authentic Pulltap's from SPAIN!!,"Just received my order from (Lily's Home). BLATANT sicker on the pack ""Made In China"" UNREAL. Claim Pulltap, but the REAL ONES are made in SPAIN!! Duh. What a waste!! Make sure you are buying the AUTHENTIC BRAND (as advertised). These are cheap!"
3,Not Pulltaps,"These corkscrews (as sold by CD Cellar) are NOT actually Pulltap, but knockoffs. They do have the double hinge, but these are clearly less well made. Functional, not worth the hassle of returning, but not Pulltap. They're also red, not black, but I don't really care about that."
1,NOT PULLTAP!!!,"These cork screws are NOT ORIGINAL PULLTAP CORK SCREWS as advertised, they are a cheap version, not well made. I indeed received a set of 4, all black, in a ziplock bag."
3,Too expensive,Same exact opener is available at local Trader Joes grocery store for $2/ea - in the aisle right next to the wine. So no real reason to want these. Sent them back.
1,bent right away,bought them for work and every single one of the corkscrews bent the first day i used them. then they would trash the corks when removing them. you get what you pay for
3,"Best corkscrew I have ever used, didn't come in the color I ordered",I ordered black and got wine colored instead. Decided it wasn't worth the hassle of returning though. This is the best corkscrew I have ever used and makes a great bottle opener too.
4,Where the Big boys play.,"This is a must see for the true MMA fan. The ""verbal MMA Match"" between Evans and Jackson were the best. A great show, with a great final."
4,For the Learned...,"Alrighty, there IS more to the story than just the uber-pretty bishie on the cover! Though, he is the main focal point, if you don't understand supernatural chi and leyline stuff, read up first and it'll make a whole lot more sense! And the H.G. Wells-ness is sorta disrupting...But overall a good read for a learned and/or patient reader. If it gets too boring you can just look at the cover and drool. Oh yeah, and beware! There is some implied squickiness...=_="
5,This man is a god....,Simply.... unbelievable... DJ Dan at his absolute best. For people who love to groove nothing can compare to his beats.... this is the type of record you put on and the smiles just keep coming.
3,An okay cd from a gread DJ,"As you read this please keep in mind that I am the type of person that likes Funk House, Disco House and Old House. Any type of house that gets you moving!If your into the same type of house that I am then this CD probably would not be the best choice for you. I own just about every DJ Dan CD and mix tape and this CD is in my opinion not his best work.From the start the the cd just jumps around to much with in each track. It reminded me a lot of a slow Bad Boy Bill. The track selection were good but failed to get me moving and were just lacking something. I purchased this CD because I am a big time supporter of DJ Dan and his awsome work. YOU ROCK DAN!If you really want to see what DJ Dan is all about then you should pick up either ""Funk The System"" or ""Mixed Live"". Hell why not both?! Both CDs track selection get you movin N groovin!"
4,This book really will change you life...again,"This Book Will change your life Again, sequel to This Book Will Change Your Life, challenges the reader to perform a different and wacky task every day. Some examples of the outlandish things I have done this year already include: claiming I am Jesus for a day, being a cannibal, boycotting something that's never been boycotted (I chose to boycott boycotting), apply to an orgy, and write a review of the book (which is what I have to do today, obviously). This book pushes the reader to expand out of their comfort zones and try new things in life every day. Either that, or it is just a complete waste of time."
4,Adorable and Fun,"I currently own both ""This Book Will Change Your Life"" and ""This Book Will Change Your Life Again."" Both books are fabulous, fun, and witty. They are quite cute and an awesome discussion piece among friends. I enjoy collecting fun and creative books and this one definitely falls into that category!"
3,Flippin around,"I haven't read this book cover to cover, but from flipping around I think it's seems darker and more sinister from the last. I'll leave it up to you to decide if that's good or bad."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This drivel looks like the results of a 3rd grade class project for Halloween. I am amazed that any publisher would print this garbage. If you're over the age of 9 and/or have an IQ above 50 this ""book"" (I use the word loosely) is a complete waste of your time. Go watch some paint dry; it will be more edifying."
5,Todd,"This CD has everything on it. Some of it sounds like early Ozark Mountain Daredevils, some of it sounds like Dylan, some of it sounds like something Joe Ely would do, and some of it sounds like Steve Earle. But it is all very original material, Mark did not just sit there and copy some cliche's. This is music for people who have enough brains to enjoy great lyrics. I very highly recommend this CD."
3,"Great Show, bad DVD","The episodes are much better than the first volume, the packaging is great, but what kills me about the dvd is no menu no navigation, the dvd automatically begins playing when inserted in player and goes through the episodes in order, forcing you to skip chapters to find episodes you're interested in."
1,glucobalance,"No idea what all the hype is about, I used this for four months and saw no difference in my blood sugar balance. I was eating right, exercising, and getting plenty of rest. These are a waste of money in my opinion."
4,wonderful concluding novel,"Maggie Furey completes her trilogy in fine form. She even leaves openings for further novels in her world of ""Myrial"". While I prefer her ""Aurian"" series more, this trilogy is worth a read and even a re-read."
3,Heart of the Horse,"What drew me to this book was the front cover. Upon looking through the book once it arrived, many of the photos inside did not live up to the one on the cover. The writing was good however. I'd recommend this book for a horse lover."
5,An exceptional book with outstanding photography!,"I have spent my entire life working with horses and havefelt for many years that they are such complex animals with great depths of emotionality; However, until I saw Heart of the Horse I had never actually seen those emotions photographed at such profound levels. It is a journey that I will enjoy taking again and again through each and every page of this extraordinary book."
5,truly stunning,Such incredibly beautiful images.Horses seen by a truly spiritual artist. They capture the inner essence and dignity of the animal in the most subtle way. A must have for every horse lover and every art lover.
3,Modern & Abstract,I have had horses my whole life and greatly appreciate a well captured photo of a horse. The pictures in this book a bit too abstract for my liking. The work is well done and the creativity is amazing; it just wasn't my style.
1,All fluff & very little stuff,"I bought this book because I had seen other horse photographs that this artist had done & thought them quite good. She has her own style & it is obviously quite different from other artists. (What would the world be if we all did everything the same or saw it just the same way?!) But sadly, this book has very little to warrant buying it. I am glad I only paid $2.00 for it at a tag sale. While the photographer certainly considers herself an artist, as do many others, there is very little of her artistic talent shown in these photographs. The introduction by Jane Goodall is well written & thought provoking & most certainly, the best part of the book."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disapointed with this book. The black and white photos were taken in a studio, not in natural habitat and many of the pictures, such as closeups of horsehair and individual body parts, were, in my opinion, irrelevant to the title of the book. Many of the pictures were abstract and out of focus."
2,Not his best ... not even close,"Sonny Rollins does calypso ... must have been a salesman's brainstorm ... some good cuts, but this can be skipped."
5,"No Doubt- New sound, but still a great band","Let me just start with, I am a huge fan of NO Doubt. I love all of their CDs, though I haven't herard their first one, but based on the reviews I'm not planning on it. Yes, true, Rock Steady is a different CD then Tragic Kingdoma and Return of Saturn. But come on people, do you really expect a band to remain the same after 15+ years of being together? It would be rather boring if they did. This CD shows that tey probably were inspired by some Jamaican reggae beats, but did not stray too far away from their roots. No Doubt is one of the bands that I can listen to the songs from beginning to end, without pressing the skip button. Some of my favorite songs include Running, Detective, and Don't Let Me Down. No Doubt also writes their own songs. I always show a lot of respect for that, and I also know that the songs came from the heart, and based on real feelings Gwen Stefani feels or other members of the band. So overall, No Doubt has not disappointed me yet."
1,Doubt if this is their best stuff,"The once talented writing from Gwen has all but gone away, along with talent of the musicians that made up the No Doubt I remember. Being a long time `East Coast' fan of No Doubt, I am dishearten at the direction this band has decided to take with their lasted project `Rock Steady' Instead of developing a project that would take advantage of their maturity and reflect on the experience of their talent, they have elected to put commercialism and teeny bobber mentally at the head of all else. Just when you thought a nice guitar sole was coming, or the drive of the once - force one drummer, nope just imitation drums sounds and what guitar, that's some high paid rapper doing what he/she knows best ..nothing worth listening to. So buy this CD if want a combo of Madonna want a be, and Juice Joe ras-ta rap man...or what ever ..-----thanks for the effort Gwen. -On the other hand, all of No Doubt's other project are top line!!"
1,Don't get sold!!,People. I have few words to say :) Just this..do not let the agglomeration of pop culture fool you into buying this cd. The band has lost whatever it had...or its been stolen from then. Avoid this cd like the plague if you are a No Doubt fan.
2,What happened?,"I was a huge No Doubt fan, I thought ""No Doubt"" was a cute album, ""Tragic Kingdom"" was just a fun rockin album, ""Return of Saturn"" was just a masterpiece, both musically and lyrically. Then comes ""Rock Steady"". I thought ""Hey Baby"" was alright, I listened to the entire album, and I admit its sort of a ""fun"" album but No Doubt's sound has totally changed. ""Running"" and ""Underneath it all"" are probably the best songs here. But the lyrics are just.. silly in comparison to the beauty of ""Saturn"". It is a decent CD but not up to par with No Doubt's full talent. I was dissapointed with the ""new style"" of music here, if anything get Tragic Kingdom or Saturn to truly hear some of ND's greatest shining moments."
2,It's..... OK...,"You really have to listen to this album more than once just to start to get a feel for it. It's not the same thing that put No Doubt on the top. When I think about how the band wrote the album while in Jamaica, I can see where some of the songs have been influenced. Overall, I'd say there is maybe one or two songs that you can totally groove to and think to yourself, ""This is still the No Doubt I remember."" Other than that, they have changed. Don't buy it if you aren't ready for their change."
1,No Doubt's worst album to date,"I would give this album 0 stars if I could. The album is horribly repetitive and even the songs are repetitive as well. The songs are essentially a chorus repeated from the beginning to the end of the song. I admire No Doubt for exploring a new sound, but this is a terrible choice and I hope this is not the direction they will be taking the music in the future. Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn are both fantastic albums worthy of anybody's collection, but if you haven't got this album and you are considering it, at least make sure you give it a listen before wasting your hard earned cash."
1,Are you kidding me?,"While I did enjoy ""Start the Fire"" and ""Running"" a bit it does not make up for the rest of this album. No Doubt used to be fun and refreshing. Now, they've sold out and released a mediocre pop album. Woo hoo. First this then a bad remake of a ""Talk Talk"" song? I've lost all respect for this band."
1,Wished I'd read the reviews here before buying,Well I bought this album without hearing a note based upon theirlast album Return of the Saturn which was an excellent album. What comes immediately to mind is what were these guys doing putting out an album this bad? I mean c'mon it sounds like bad 80's retro music meets Hip-Hop. They even bring in Ric Ocasek to produce 2 songs that sound like bad outtakes from Heartbeat City.This album is bad bad bad.
4,I love No Doubt,"No Doubt has managed to merge hip hop, dance, ska, and pop together to make a CD that will rock your socks off!! Gwen Stefani's voice is so unique, and the music just hits you between the eyes. I would recommend this CD to everyone! Oh, the other cool thing is that it's appropriate for any age. I bought it for my 13 year old daughter. I love Gwen because she sings about love and relationships in a healthy way. Buy it for yourself or your young ones!"
4,"Different, But Not Bad","This album is packed with interesting songs with different beats and rhythms. Some of the songs int his album are different from older No Doubt songs. My favorite songs in this album are ""Making Out"", ""Running"", and ""In My Head"". ""Running"" is a slower song with a really good message in it. One good thing about this album is that it contains no annoying song. There's no song that you might rather skip. Anyway, this is a good-to-have album. It's the first No Doubt album that I have bought. I have heard from people who have listened to previous No Doubt albums that this one is pretty bad compared to the other ones, but I don't think that this album is bad at all."
2,You're kidding me right?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Stefani and the band, but they seem to be getting worse with each album. Their first single of this record, ""Hey Baby"" sounds like something a couple of 15 year old kids would write because they didn't feel like doing their homework. It's so annoying, I can't hit the radio dial fast enough to change the station! If the band were still unknowns trying to make it, every producer in the land would easily pass on this album. It's almost like ""We're big, we're famous, we don't have to write and record anything well written anymore."" Come on guys.. you can do better."
3,Doubting No Doubt,"This album, recorded very soon after RETURN OF SATURN is a complete departure from the previous CD. Gone is the guitar-oriented sound of the band. Apart from Gwen's recognizable voice, there is little on the album to suggest that this is even No Doubt. The songs, although highly repetitious are very catchy, but unfortunately not very original. One gets the feeling that he has heard it all before somewhere. It is clear that the band has gotten bored of their signature style and wants to brave new waters. But they should stick to what they do best. The unsettling thing is that most bands, once they depart from their original formula, rarely return. Too bad. It looks as if TRAGIC KINGDOM and RETURN OF SATURN will mark the high point of their career, at least artistically."
1,disappointed =(,"This album is very weak for No Doubt. What happened???? I can't even listen to any of the songs all the way through! I am VERY disappointed in Gwen, I know she could have done better. They should have taken more time to make the music and put it all together like they did with The Return of Saturn. This album was totally rushed and it shows! I would not even waste my time downloading it, let-alone buying it! Sorry to say it, but this album is NOT good."
3,OK...,"This CD was worse than ""Tragic Kingdom"", but somewhat better than ""Return of Saturn"". There are a few OK, melodic, catchy songs. My fave was ""Hey Baby"", which is saying something, because it's not an unforgettable song. But some of the songs, like ""Detective"", were the stupidest I've ever heard. Some of the songs go into a sort of reggae feel, and some are almost-rock. They all have a bit of an electronic feel, but overall, this CD is not very good and not very bad. It's all right. If you think you like the electronic stuff, go for it. Depending on who you are, you may or may not like this CD."
1,apex of idiocy,"well, it figures...the first song released off this album is that completely annoying anthem to moronic lyrics, ""hey baby."" i've been watching (listening at times) as a band that had such great messages like ""just a girl"" has just gone completely downhill. i find it amusing to see members of this band drape themselves in t-shirts of bands like ""madness"" and ""the specials (i think...)"" as if this should immediately translate into some type of street cred and should minimalize the fact that their music just plain sucks. ..."
1,so dissapointed,"i am a huge no doubt fan and have all of their CD's and recently added Rock Steady to my collection. each one of the albums before I had fallen instantly in love with but when i popped this one into my CD player i was very dissapointed. I found most of the songs to be very similar to one another yet hardly any of them are even somewhat decent! and no doubt's origional ska/punk edge was lost and they seem to be heading towards a more technoish beat which i didn't like at all. I never listen to this album now and still continue playing my favorite album ""Return of Saturn"""
4,"It's different, but not necessarily bad...","Yes, it's true, Rock Steady is a lot different than Tragic Kingdom, but it's not a bad album by any means. ""Hey Baby"" is actually better as a video, so get it if you can. ""Making Out"" and ""Hella Good"" are also good.Oh, and if you download one of these songs from the 'net and find that it's just a chorus looped over and over...that's not the real song. Duh."
4,No Doubt's new album....,"When i first bought this album, and popped it into my CD player, i was kind of surprised. I knew that No Doubt was going for a more dance - hall kind of sound, but this doesn't sound at all like the No Doubt we all know and love. That doesn't mean that it's bad music. In fact, that 13.99 was well spent.The tracks ""Detective"" and ""Plaitnum Blond Life"" are reminders of the kind of ska inspired music they used to play.It's a good album, overall. Just...different. And a sound that we're not used to hearing from No Doubt. But i recommend it all the same."
1,Would the real No Doubt please stand up!?,"I don't know how this happened, but the No Doubt I've known and loved for years has somehow been replaced by not-so-delicious Folgers Crystals! How they could put their name on this sleazy thrust at top-40 playlists is incomprehensible to me. After all the hullabaloo over the band's image when the first Tragic Kingdom videos were shot, this kowtow to mediocrity just serves as confirmation that these talented and intelligent folks have completely sold out."
4,took awhile to get used to...,"at first i was like ok, this is weird and different, but now i like it. it's very 80's/Jamaican/weird. my favorites songs would have to be ""Don't Let Me Down"" and ""Platinum Blonde Life"". i think that ""Don't Let Me Down"" is like very 80's sounding, but i'm only 15 so what do i know. i LOVE ""Platinum Blonde Life"", it's more kinda rock sounding. the only thing i don't like about the cd is the Jamaican sound to it. i think that they kinda ruined ""Underneath It All"" with the Jamaican music. it's a pretty good cd tho."
4,the band's name says it all... NO DOUBT!,"I'll admit right up front that I'm not easy to please. So when I went into the local cd store and asked two of the female sales clerks what they thought of the new No Doubt, and they gave me less than glowing reviews based on the single, I was VERY apprehensive. But when I put it into the cd player of my car for the drive home, I had a ... grin on my face that a plastic surgeon couldn't have removed! The group has matured and they are ready to take on more complex material while still having a helluva lot of fun! Everyone who has heard my copy has gone out to buy their own... except the intransigent fans of No Doubt's earlier work who just can't let go. No, it's not rock... but fans of Madness will instantly understand why ND's new release is called ROCK STEADY!"
2,Not worth it,"This is No Doubt's worst CD to date. It isn't worth the hour, the fourteen bucks, or the electricity. Their older stuff is so much better than this, wich is suddenly low grade hip-hop. I am dissapointed."
1,"Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby......","Talk about a total turnaround, everything that has been good about No Doubt in the past is pretty much gone from this album. It sounds like Gwen went in and laid down about a 10-second track for each song and then the producer just hit the ""Repeat"" button to fill the rest of the song. I'm listening to the album for the first time right now and it's totally true! Whoever wrote the lyrics for these songs must have been extremely lazy. What happened to No Doubt the ""band""?? Pop music is ruining my world!!"
2,"One for the Masses- ""Steady"" as Dust on A ""Rock""","Electronic Dance is new to this group so I do give it a star for the transition from ska-influenced pop to this....trendy, boring instrumentation, weak voice, packaged MTV goal as if they are screaming for boy band and pop princess appeal. They have those fans but will this album keep the real fans- those who have grown with them? I long for the earlier passion which this cd lacks- only took a year to put out? It shows.Dance gets old. Electronic lacks musical depth. Gwen's personality can't keep this spinning for long. It's ashame that No Doubt feels they must compete with the unoriginal chart toppers of today's music. I'll stick to the very 1st album."
3,Different...,"I will say this right out, this CD is not as good as their CD Tragic Kingdom! There are a few really good songs on this Cd like ""Underneath It All"", ""Platinum Blonde Life"", and ""Rock Steady"", but the rest of it is not really that good in my opinion. Well, that's all, I guess. Check out some of their older CDs, I think you would be more satisfied with them. :)"
1,What happened to ska?,"This CD is not No Doubt as they were in Tragic Kingdom. Tragic Kingdom is an awesome CD. This CD has gone pop. The ska is not there as it was. The first single, Hey Baby, sounds more like Britney Spears than it does No Doubt. I was singing this song and my friend told me to stop singing Britney Spears. I told him that it was No Doubt and he had two words: BYE BYE.There are a FEW good songs on this record, but if you really liked Tragic Kingdom, and think that is what No Doubt should be, DONT GET THIS ALBUM!"
2,I should have just bought the single.,"I wasn't crazy about Hey Baby when it hit the radio, but once I heard Hella Good, I wanted to buy the CD. I think Hella Good is a great song and is reminicient of the No Doubt of the 90s. I've always loved their ska base and punk feel. But this album is nothing like that. I hate to say this, but it's awful. The only song I like on Rock Steady is still Hella Good, which is the only reason I gave this album two stars. The rest of the songs are these cheesy lyrics and reggae beats that aren't even fun to listen to -- it's just painful."
4,This album is not ska,"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM BECAUSE YOU LIKE PREVIOUS NO DOUBT ALBUMS - This album is very different. I could see people being really disappointed and upset if you are expecting No Doubt's usual Ska sound. This album is more dance/electronic than ska. Take a listen to some of the samples from the songs, or wait until you hear it on the radio if you might not like this stuff.That said, I'm pretty happy with the album. The songs are catchy, and Gwen's voice is awesome as usual. I do miss the horns and ska sounds, but I've gotten beyond that now :-)"
1,They're not even trying,"I used to think that Shelby Lynne's ""Love, Shelby"" was the worst release by a major artist in 2001, but here comes No Doubt's ""Rock Steady."" I've never heard such a lazy, ridiculous, tuneless, pointless release. Poorly played dance tracks from the band that brought us great introspective rock tunes? It's obvious that Gwen Stefani is now much more interested in being a POP STAR than an being, an artist with anything important to say, and let's face it, with a face and body like her's, that's not hard to do. But give up on No Doubt--it simply isn't much of a band to begin with, and look for Gwen's ""motion picture acting debut"" any minute now. WHAT a disappointment. Bye, bye, No Doubt..."
3,Perhaps not the best ever,"Somewhere along the lines of the many reviews written, I hear this might me a comeback album. It's okay. Not the best from No Doubt- if you really want some unique style, Beacon Street and Tragic Kingdom are their best, showing off more originality and less drama of Gwen and Gavin's relationship in the lyrics. Don't get me wrong, there's some great songs on here. Hey Baby was first released, so it's all over the radio, Hella Good is catchy. Making Out too. But the background in Running sounds like someone clipped the original Super Mario Bros. background and looped it. If you want to hear Reggae meets pop go for it."
1,The worst No Doubt album ever.,"I am a very big No Doubt fan--I own their last two albums, TRAGIC KINGDOM and RETURN OF SATURAN and love them both! But ROCK STEADY is a horrible album. The only good song is the first single, ""Hey Baby"", which happens to be very catchy. Is No Doubt trying to do rap or hip-hop? And sure, the album itself LOOKS cool, but the music on here is not. Gwen Stefani's vocals are better than ever, but the lyrics and music just doesn't live up to their other previous albums. I'll skip ROCK STEADY (I borrowed this CD at my town's library), and I'll just buy the ""Hey Baby"" CD-Single instead. This album was very disappointing and I think a lot of No Doubt fans were disappointed with it, too. I think No Doubt is getting desparate for more fans so they are trying to get little teenyboppers into them or something. Sorry, but this album was bad. I think I'll go and buy Shakira's new English debut, LAUNDRY SERVICE, instead!"
3,Steady Bubble Gum,"I suppose I thought this might be more like ""Return to Saturn,"" which dealt with some complex emotions and issues, and had great punk/ska/techno sounds on it. Instead ""Rock Steady"" sounds geared toward high school girls or young women having their first real crush (or having their first beer, even). The songs are fun and good to have on as background music (where mindless repetition isn't a problem), but don't look for depth or even great songwriting. A bit of a waste of their talents."
4,Makes Me Feel Happy,"I just listened to this album, and now I'm going to buy it and ""Return of Saturn."" I've never listened to an album like this before. It's happy, makes me want to go on vacation for about a month. It has influences in reggae, good 80s music (I think), and dance/techno-type music (I don't know how to describe it). But this is certainly a rock album, not a pop album. My favorite songs are ""Underneath It All,"" ""Don't Let Me Down,"" ""Start The Fire,"" ""In My Head,"" and ""Waiting Room"" and ""Rock Steady."" But I love all of the tracks. This album will stand as a new, unique type of listening in collection, and I have a lot of cds from many genres. I'm really glad that No Doubt made this album."
2,Amazing what bands will do for a little more cash..,"No Doubt used to be one of my favorite bands a while back, I still had respect for them.. then this came out, it's nothing like the old punk/ska stuff that used to do.. while I've only heard the songs they've taken mainstream, this looks like a total ""pop"" cd. I just find it amazing how half decent bands sell out and become part of corporate America.. just for more money. *sigh*"
3,A Good Album from a Great Band,"Rock Steady is a decent recording effort and features a couple of very well-written songs. Alot of the material is forgettable, however, though it tends to be better than the melodramatic ""Return of Saturn"".My personal favorite on the disc would be track 9, ""Running"". It is subdued, carefully-chorded, and Gwen Stefani manages to inject the lyric with sweetness. Radio hits ""Hella Good"" and ""Hey Baby"" are decent tracks as well, although they fall more into the category of mindless party music (not necessarily a bad thing).I continue to buy and enjoy No Doubt's work, and Rock Steady should appeal to a broad range of listeners."
3,Always Great but Not Their Best...,"No Doubt will always be fabulous but this CD still does not really shine like Tragic Kingdom did, although I think it's better than Return of Saturn. Tragic Kingdom will always be a constant on my play list, but Rocksteady will fall away sooner rather than later. I bought the CD just before going to their concert and was very disappointed in it. However, after seeing them perform many of the Rocksteady's song live, I like them much better. ""Hey Baby"" is an awfully fun song and I do enjoy hearing it, though I think perhaps it is one of the weaker songs on this album. At any rate, I feel rather neutral about this CD - hence the 3. Will always love them but was not blown away with this latest endeavor."
2,Rocksteady is lame-steady.,I can't believe how gimmicky No Doubt has become. Their ragga dance hall music smells of cheap imitation. Record stinks.
3,"Ok, but they've done better","Don't buy this album with the expectation of hearing the gushing angst filled ""who am I?"" lyrics of the previous albums. It reminds me of reggae with a Debbie Harry kind of groove thrown in. While I'm not crazy about the album now, I'm sure that with time it will grow on me like Return of Saturn."
4,A new sound for No Doubt,"Well. Rock Steady was very...different than No Doubt's other work. It is completely different from Tragic Kingdom, which had more of a rock-y feel. Rock Steady's first four or so songs have an electronic sound, but most of them were pretty good. ""Hey Baby"", of course, is the catchiest song on the album. ""Hella Good"" also produces a great beat, but some songs, like ""Detective"", were a real disappointment. They were boring and not at all like No Doubt's usual work. Overall, I think Rock Steady was pretty good, but it could've been better. I think people liked the ska feeling, and the rock sound on Tragic Kingdom, but...let No Doubt decided for themselves what sound they like. (P.S. I like the rock-y feel.)"
1,Not even worth downloading from Morpheus!,"I was given this CD for my birthday, and I can tell you I'm sorry someone thought this was a nice gift! This was a total waste of money. The music has been done, the sounds are nothing but regurgitated 80's synthesizers and wanna-be reggae. Hey guys, remember when Blondie made it big and then tried the reggae thing? Didn't work for them, and NoDoubt didn't make it work either. The only song worth listening to - Hey Baby - has been played so much I'm sick of hearing it. Save your money. Go buy one of the ""best of the 80's"" compilations. The sounds are about the same. If you want the CD, write me and I'd be happy to send you mine!"
3,Hit and miss.,"I purchased ""Rock Steady"" because I loved No Doubt's song ""Hey Baby"" and I wanted a good rock-type CD. I have mixed feelings about the album.There are some awesome songs on here, like ""Underneath It All,"" ""Hey Baby,"" ""Hella Good"" and ""Making Out."" But beyond that, the rest of the songs are rather bland -- nothing special.Unlike No Doubt's previous releases, this album doesn't have much of a rock feel to it. It's more pop. Overall, though, it's still a fun album, but not their best."
2,DiD TRL kick in?????,"WHAT HAPPENED? No Doubt went from playing awesome music, true ska, to playing electronic pop stuff....i know most bands ""sell out"" but i mean come on....I would not reccommend this record to anyone who liked the old skool no doubt...it is not ska...it is TRL music...Gwen did Eve change ya??? Terrible....stick to your roots..."
2,A sampler CD?,"I was highly anticipating the new release from No Doubt. Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed. ""Rock Steady"" plays like a sampler CD. Nearly every song begins with a sort of fade-in. Absolutely no intros: guitar, bass, drums, or otherwise. Then the song is four or so minutes of a chorus repeated again and again. One reviewer described it as listening to a broken record. I have to concur.I'll admit, the grooves and sounds on this CD are superb, but there's no semblence of a decently constructed song. Maybe this works for trance, but it doesn't suit No Doubt very well.The one notable exception is ""Hey Baby"" which actually has a normal song structure.I'll stick with ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Return of Saturn"" and hope No Doubt puts out some better material in the future."
2,talk about repetitive,"Let me just say off the bat that I love No Doubt. I think Gwen Stefani rocks, and both Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn stayed in my CD changer for about a year. So I was super excited to hear new material, but wow what a disappointment. If you just play the CD as background music and not really pay attention, then this CD is actually pretty good. But if you stop and listen, you realize that every song is comprised of a 10 second snippet repeated about 40 times to make a 4 minute song. If you haven't heard the album yet, you probably think I'm exaggerating, but I swear I am not. I really thought there was something wrong with my CD player or the CD until I skipped to the next track and encountered the same thing. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, then any No Doubt fan will like this CD. For me, however, it drove me absolutely insane. On every song, I found myself saying: ""Please please for the love of God, say something else Gwen!!!"""
2,looped lyrics and pseudo Britney Spears beats,"My title says it all. Listening to Rock Steady is like being forced to sit through looped Britney Spears, C. Aguilerra like beats. Songs are composed of one stanza repeated throughout the song??? What happened?I don't have anything good to say about this one..."
2,No Doubt leaves....some doubt.,"I was extremely disappointed with this latest CD. After seeing ""Hey Baby"" released I was worried that the new album would be awful yet I still held out hope that somehow through all this hype and media/fashion coverage of Gwen that perhaps No Doubt would stick to their roots as a blazing rock/ska group. However I got the album listened to them only to hear each song is pretty much the same phrase over and over. It sounds like Reggae meets the 80's. What happened to ""Return of Saturn"" and ""Tragic Kingdom""? Why try to fix what wasn't broken?"
1,"""What"" Steady???","No Doubt took the rock right out of ""Rock Steady"" on this one! With over 600 CDs in my collection, I've never felt the need to return a purchase I've made...until now. To compare this CD to No Doubt's previous recordings, you would never think that this was the same band.Now, if you're into keyboard-laden, disco/hip-hop, NON-ROCK tunes this might be the CD for you. But if it's good guitar riffs, or ANY guitar riffs that you'd expect from a ""rock"" CD... keep on looking. Tom Dumont is nearly impossible to find on this recording.This review may sound harsh, but I am actually a huge No Doubt fan. I can only hope that this ""tragic recording"" was an experiment, and for their next CD they will ""return to earth"" and give us something great to listen to... again."
2,What's wrong with No Doubt?!,"Okay-what's with No Doubt?This album shows their yearn for pop domination.Britney Spears and all the other anorexic princesses get old.Most fans want the ska influenced kids from Orange County,not the same old rap and dance music.This album shows their drastic change from ska/rock to the same old stuff.Come on guys-it's time to grow up a little."
1,HELLA BAD,"Sorry, Fans...But even this is maybe my favourite band, i hate this cd. ""Hey Baby"" ""Detective"" and some others silly songs, are so empty and really bad to me.They wants to be more fun,caribean, and fresh but they don't. Anyway, ""Platinum blonde Life"" and ""Hella Good"" can be fun. Buy it if you want, but..."
1,Sorry Effort,"While this album has a few bearable tracks on it, most songs are annoyingly repetitive and easily forgettable. It is nowhere near as infectious as the band's earlier releases. I'm embarrassed for No Doubt. ... Hopefully they will return to their roots for the next release."
2,No Doubt its Dissapointing,"I have been a No Doubt fan for quite a while, and I have to say that as much as I was looking forward to this album, I am even more dissapointed. They have really taken a step down in the quality and thought put into thier music. Before they had a fun, twisted punk sound, and now most of thier songs sound like the same mass-produced guitar riffs all over the radio, used in all the ""pop star bubblegum"" sound thats out there now. Gwen sounds more like Christina Agulera or Brittany Spears than ever. I am left hoping they look more back to where they started in order to achieve a better sound, because this one just doesn't get it."
2,eh,"well.. this album is completely different from something like tragic kingdom. I really liked tragic kingdom, I don't really like this. I guess you have to respect them for being willing to change their musical direction. But... unfortunately unhappy heartbroken Gwen Stefani made for better lyrics and music than happy content Gwen Stefani. Most of these songs have a real lack of depth. There is not one ""deep"" song on the album. Which can be ok. It's a fun album. Nothing special."
3,Not what I expected,"This Cd is alright - if you want to go to an insland for the summer! It took me completly by surprise. Gwen usually doesn't have this ""jamaican"" style to her songs but it seems this way on this Cd. I personly didn't like it, considering I'm a punk person and Gwen is usually the limit to my punk/pop music tastes. However I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys Gwen's funky styles of song writing and singing."
5,Don't just listen once,"After the last turkey I bought this whilst I was drunk. When it arrived I put it on in the background and it didn't sound so great, but it stayed in the player and after a few days I found myself really liking it. Not only is it funky as hell, the lyrics are witty. Buy it, trust me."
5,Rock On,"No Doubt's latest offering ROCK STEADY is a bit of a departure from their other albums. As a fan, you either love it, or you don't. This fan here loves it. The album has a more electronica feel, with a few more beats and texturized sounds. No Doubt worked with a variety of producers on this album, namely William Orbit, Nellee Hooper, Prince, etc. The result is a fun party album which has a variety of music styles, including reggae, ska, pop, and more. To me the biggest standout of the album is the Prince produced track ""Waiting Room"", which is an irresistible song to listen to, very catchy, hopefully it will be released as a single. Other great songs include ""Running"", which features compelling vocals by Gwen, some of her best, ""Making Out"", ""Underneath it All"", ""Hey Baby"" and ""Rock Steady"". Not for everyone, but its a nice move and overall a great album. Give it a try."
3,It truly does depend on you about this one,"This Cd is a weird one to rate.On one side, it doesn't really sound like No doubt. It is more of a Hip-Hop/Pop thing. People who are looking for the music they heard in ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Return of Saturn"" won't like this CD at all. They might get pretty mad about it too, the fact that they paid 15 buck for a CD they hate.(Like me, Ha Ha.) It isn't really the kind of music for those Ska, Rock, and Alt. fans at all.On the other hand, it is an unusal sound. Not new, but unusaly diffrent and nice. If you like things like ""Pink"" you will like this. This CD appeals more to Hip-Hop, Pop, and Dance fans.I didn't like this CD at all. But I was expecting more of a Ska/Alt. Rock sound, and its not that at all. and it isn't so detestable that I am ashamed to have the name Gwen. But it really depends on what kind of music you listen to.I gave it three stars for half/half."
2,Wha' Happened?,"I've been watching No Doubt for 15 years now, watching their careers from dive-bar-club-dates-and-two-singers-kickin'-ska-band to the current force-to-be-reckoned-with-global-pop-sensations. When I heard ""Just A Girl"" on the radio a few years ago, I freaked out and thought, ""good for them, they've worked hard and made it"". Tragik Kingdom and Return to Saturn were both great albums that reflected not only the growth of a band but progression and morphing of sound as a unit. Now we have ""Rock Steady"" and I am baffled. What happened here, folks? Tons of style (Gwen being a style guru) here, but no substance to be found. I wanted to like it. Really. I did. But I felt like I was listening to Britney Aguilera. Maybe next album will be better. I can appreciate the concept of testing new materials, but it only works when you can back it up with some substance."
1,No Doubt-This album stinks,"I could not believe this was a No Doubt album when I first heard it. How can a band that has consistently been so good be so BAD! If you like repetition this album is for you. I have three children so the concept of a phrase being repeated over and over is not a new one to me. I have always enjoyed Gwen's writing ability, that was one of the things that first interested me in the band was the clever lyrics, new and creative ways of saying old things. I was excited to see what they would come up with this time. It took me all of 3 minutes to realize what they had come up with, now it's going to take me 3 weeks to get the ringing out of my ears. I read somewhere that Gwen likes to use a thesaurus when she is writing, but on this album she didn't-believe me it shows! Bottom line-Gwen should go back to using a thesaurus because this recording is bad,amiss,...,dissatisfactory,poor and rotten!"
4,Another Great Album from the group No Doubt,"I have to say this one was a little different for me. But after a good listen, I realised that I was glad I purchased it."
2,Too weird,"I usually like the half hardcore image and music of No DOubt, which I expected after, ""Hella Good,"" but this album spun off in totally new directions. I don't like it...the whole vibe was really strange, especially the chorus of, ""Rock Steady,"" which gave me the creeps. I could hardly make it through a single song on it. And after hearing, ""Hey Baby,"" forty-five times a day off the radio two months ago, it just got annoying."
1,Generic New Wave THAT WANTS TO BE a Facisimile of THE FAINT,"Why own this generic annoying rip off? There is no good reason. This is just no doubt trying to be a band they admire. That band-The Faint. This band has been doing what Rock Steady wants to do, for at least 2 albums now, and probably about 5 years. If you want to listen to Rock Steady, and feel good about it, check out Blank Wave Arcade and Danse Macabre by The Faint, the albums are cheaper, more orginal, and way more worth your time. Thank You."
1,do not buy!!!!!!!!,Okay I used to really like no doubt but their first single was horrible so I didn't buy the cd and decided to wait for the second single. Now that the second single is out it sounds even worse and from the 30 second clips that I have heard from it makes it sound even more bad!!!!!!!!! They used to be good alternative rock but now they are just another pop band!!!!!!
2,Drowning in mainstream polish,"As another review stated, don't compare this to past No Doubt albums. Indeed, their sound has changed --and of course, it's nice to see a band grow and experiment. Overall, this is pretty much a fun and poppy album. But even as a stand alone album, it's heavily disappointing. Not all of the songs are like this, but the majority of it is dull and repetitive. What do I mean? I start listening to the song, it sounds good with a lot of potential and promis, but then it starts to repeat the same tune again and again for the next three or four minutes. Wait, where's the beginning, middle and end? Good as mindless background music or lift-me up/relaxer, but not spectacular."
3,"""Let's talk about Gwen Stefani...""","Rock Steady by No Doubt is their last studio album before Gwen went solo, and boy that was biggest mistake she ever made. Gwen can't sing but the band rock! Gwen is all about image and looking good (which she rarely achieves) she knows her voice is lacklaster and that's why the only thing she can focus on is the materalistic BS! Rock Steady has too many producers and not a clear and simplistic sound. Songs I do like include: Platinum Blonde Life, Don't Let Me Down, In My Head, Hella Good, and Running. The rest of the tracks are over-played and filler. Hopefully the band will reunite in years to come but the talent and success doesn't go to Gwen, it goes to the hard-working and under-appreciated guys."
5,What's there not to like?,This is such a great work from No Doubt! A perfect combination of songs! Really amazing! You can really feel the band's soul in each cord they play!
3,"Okay, but not stellar.","There are a few good songs on here, but you don't hear Gwen's song-writing voice as much as I'd like."
4,I dig it,"I have had this cd for about three weeks now [never mind how] and I can honestly say that I am still listening to it. Don't know what that is worth but take it. I don't see a point to that intro, Hella good is a GREAT song, making out is up there too, and I like Don't let me down. Now these songs are all bouncy and fun to listen to, I think they did a good job. The reason I give it four stars is because I feel the tunes themselves could have been better. But it does grow on you! :)"
2,disappointing!,"The good news first - - the music itself I think is an improvement. No Doubt is a band on this CD, not just Gwen's support. But it ends there. Most of the songs consist of a funky little beat with 2-4 lines of lyric...that's it! They repeat the same 2 lines of lyric over and over again, eventually fading out and calling it a song. It's a poor effort, and makes me wonder if they were in a hurry to get the album out...examples: Hella Good, Making Out, Underneath it All, Don't let me Down, Running, In My Head, Platinum Blonde...it goes on...and on...and on...What a disappointment!!"
5,Best No Doubt CD out of All,"You may have thought Trgic Kingdom and Return Of Saturn were great, but just wait until you listen to Rock Steady. It is so great. It's kind of like a mix of disco and the 80's, but still has that new millenium vibe. No matter what you won't want to take it out of your CD player. Trust me, the [money] bucks you spend on it, [is] worth it."
5,Will they EVER make a weak album? I hope not...,"When No Doubt first came out I was not too impressed...but then I bought Return of Saturn and was blown away! Really hard heavy rock, yet very catchy! This album is more funky then their last one, and they do it well. The songs are catchy with great beats and lyrics, Gwen and the boys did a great job! Head bobbin, dancing, singing along, backround music, blaring out of your car windows...this album can do all that and more!"
4,BEWARE -- Morpheus/KaZaA versions vs. CD -- BEWARE (really!),"I couldn't believe it -- 80% of the versions on Morpheus/Kazaa are truly crap. Somebody just looped a 30 second sample for 4 minutes, then faded it out. Very lame.On the CD, *NONE* of the songs fade in -- they all have intros. If you download a version that fades in -- it's a bogus rip.Anyway, I bought the CD, and it's pretty good. (I had to know!)Also, the morpheus/kazaa fakes sound like 64/96 kbps -- the CD is much more crisp.So I learned my lesson -- don't trust everything you download from Morpheus/KaZaA!"
3,Not exactly what I expected...,"ROCK STEADY was not exactly what I expected. When I heard that No Doubt were heading to Jamaica to record a 'reggae' CD, I expected the No Doubt sound to lean more towards my fave band of all time, THE POLICE. Unfortunately, this was not to be. As a bassist, I was disappointed by Tony's basslines. He's still a great player, but it was too simplistic this time out. (I'm sure that was the point) I'm looking forward to the next CD, though. Perhaps seeing them perform the new tunes live will sway my opinion of them. Hopefully, they'll rock them out!"
2,WHAT???????,"The only decent songs on there were Waiting Room and Platinum Blonde Life. I could put up with Hey Baby and Hella Good, but only for so long. The rest of the songs are a pitiful attempt at sugary sweet pop that makes me sick. I await the return of their good music, like from Return of Saturn and Tragic Kingdom. Until then, I mourn."
1,BORING!,On the edge of disposable? If it were any more so the cd would come with a mission impossible-esque self destructive fuse. The world's worst soup (a lil' bit of everything without a mastery of any one part) that is spoiled by too many cooks. Toss in an obnoxious singer with a paper thin voice and you get No Doubt! Wake me when it's over...
1,A Drastic Change for No Doubt Fans,"Dance Hall music. What happend to No Doubts fun funky style where Gwen did'nt repeat 2 sentences over and over again that talk about ""keep on dancin""? Did they us a pansonic keyboard and a drum machine to make this album?I think they also took some clips out of Nintendo's game Zelda for one track, this album is a complete turn around from anything expected from No Doubt. On they're past albums I could relate to their lyrics, now i feel like im listening to Britney Spears and it makes me sick, if you have been a No Doubt fan in the past, I think you would see where I am coming from. Lets just hope the next album appeals to more than the pop world."
3,Just Okay,"This album isn't really what I've come to expect from No Doubt. Unlike a lot of critics and the record buying public, I thought their last studio album ""Return to Saturn"" was their best--I still do.There are some bright spots on ""Rock Steady"" : ""Hey Baby"" grew on me after about three listens; ""Underneth it All"" has a dancehall/ska vibe to it that's pretty infectious and well done; ditto for ""Start the Fire"" & ""In My Head"" which are upbeat pleasurable tracks. The rest of the CD, is a little too much of a throwback to 1980's synth-poprock with some tracks using only keyboards and no real intruments. The ""Hella Good"" track is the worst ND has ever recorded. Gwen's heavy breathing over parts of the refrain remind me of Titney's awful ""Slave 4 U.""Gwen's voice may be an irritant to some but I found that it has matured nicely and she's moved away from the shrill nasal sound that worked so well on No Doubts second CD.This isn't in my 2001 Top 10 disks but it's still a good disk."
1,Horrible (Zero Stars),"I didn't have to buy this CD to tell you it blows, i just heard the song on the radio and then i wrote this review. Listen i've seen this happen to many punk bands, but this is by far the worst!! Not only have they sold out, but they changed the whole way that they write music. And thats a total slap in the face to punk-ska, the genre of music that made them famous in the first place. Some call it evolving, i call it SELLING OUT TO THE INDUSTRY!!!! Now that Gwen Stafani has no use for a band i dont even know why they pretend that they like the new album."
1,"Unbelievably, shockingly, yet not surprisingly BAD","Awful. That's all I can say. The quality of No Doubt's music has gone steadily downhill these past few years, Tragic Kingdom being their springboard into not onky bad work, but shockingly ba work. This album from what used to be a break-out punk/ska band? Excuse me, but I say no. The album is dominated by recycled and unoriginal songs that have no message at all. Can someone please tell me the significance of such crap as ""Hey Baby""? I can't believe this album was allowed to be made. Nothing about it warrants any merit. Gwen Stefani, yet again, dominates the band and music with her highly developed ""Madonna on Crack"" performances and dress. All I can say is, this album was a waste of time, and now I realize that being a fan of this band was a waste of time, too. If you have ever liked No Doubt, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,this is not No Doubt,"if you really like no doubt, and what they are REALLY about, don't get this cd. They are not hip hop, they are, or use to be one of the best ""one of a kind"" bands out there. now they are leaning tawards mainstream.don't get this cd, unless you dont like their origonal stuff.i hope gwen wakes up and sees what she has become. i miss the real No Doubt."
1,Hmmmmmmm......um.......interesting,"Terrible, terrible! Ive gotten ripped off! On the back i see it comes with 13 songs...but all i get is this one long song that keeps changing its tempo! ALL OF THESE SONGS SOUND HE SAME! Im sticking to listening to Tragic Kingdom."
5,GREAT CD!,"I have been a No Doubt fan ever since Tragic Kingdom, and all I can say is that this CD is one of their greatest! This CD just shows you how a band can change their style of music and still kick A**! So many great songs in this album, trust me, once you buy it you will be amazed at how many songs you'll fall in love with. Not to talk about all the songs you have probably already heard on the radio! Once again: GREAT CD!"
2,a crash and burn,"no doubt's rock steady is a totally different bend in the road. tragic kingdom, return to saturn, the beacon street collection, and no doubt self titled are all 100% better. I loved no doubt, and then rock steady came out. the lyrics are very good, but the music is not my type. on their previous cds, no doubt had a sound that no one else had- now it seems like theyre trying to fit in.... i certinly hope they go back to their old style, the better style, and not more rock steady type cds. hopefully more people will relize that this is a crash and burn, and that no doubt will go back to their ska sounding music."
2,"Targeted marketing, not music","This album sounds like the songs were written to target different demographic and musical segments. Let's see, one song for the hip hop fans, another for rock and so on and so on...It's all so canned and programmed. Give it a skip and buy the earlier albums."
1,Is this a joke?,"All of these songs just repeat the same lyric over and over again. It would be kind of funny if it didn't cost $15. Seriously, make sure you hear this before you spend any money on it. What an embarrassment for a group that displayed a good deal of talent once upon a time..."
3,Well...there's more than just a chorus to a song...,"I like all of the songs on this CD except for one minor detail; a lot of them just consist of the chorus being repeated over and over and over. Take the song ""Making Out""--it's the same thing played about 15 times in a row. Too bad, this could have been a good CD."
5,Great Album!!!!,I would say that most of the songs on this album are pretty good. Exept for like on or two songs (Don't Let Me Down & Waiting Room). I like the variety of beats that were incorporated in this album. Something different from Return of Saturn was that this cd is mostly upbeat compared to Return.. which was more mellow and slow. Good job No Doubt....
4,?,"I personally didn't like this album at all. I liked a few songs, but I found most of the CD to be quite blah compared to their previous albums. They really strayed from their ska background as well."
4,a review from someone who has a REAL copy of the album,"...now for the album. don't expect ""rock steady"" to be comparable to ""tragic kingdon"" or even ""return to saturn."" although they have grown and matured as a band by blending electronica, pop, hip-hop, reggae/dancehall, and r&b; with rock, its nothing groud breaking or ""brilliant"" nor is it supposed to be. the use of catchy loops and gwen's familiar voice makes ""rock steady"" a pleasant and fun album, which is what the band is all about."
2,Not quite what i was thinking for no doubt,"this cd is not the no doubt that i know! they seemed to abandon their original sound for a more pop sound. although i like some of the songs and some are good to dance to like ""making out"" it's not the same awesome sound that same from tragic kingdom. for anyone who likes the original no doubt sound, i don't recommend it, but it might appeal to some people."
2,Just Plain Bad.,"Their lastest effort ""Rock Steady"" by No Doubt is terrible. I bought this Cd thinking it would be great because it was by No Doubt but it turned out to be the worst CD I have heard in years. ""Hey Baby"" has to be the most annoying song, every time I hear it on the radio I cringe. The next song ""Rock Steady"" is irritating. I didn't think No Doubt would ever do an album like this, well I guess I was wrong. I don't recommend this bad album."
1,Two Words: REALLY BAD,compaired to their other 3 albums this album is their worst. i liked the others because when i heard them i felt that i relaited. they came out with this album in one year and it shows the reason that i like no doubt was because they had good lyrics and the albums showed care and this one had like a course and that was it. i hate pop and hip hop. because its not even music. if anyone is a tragic kingdom or return of saturn fan i advise you not to buy this album
1,Rock Steady????,"I have Been a No Doubt Fan For A LONG time and i must say this is the WORST cd by them i have heard. There is nothing ""rock"" about this CD and i have a question for all of u.... this is a band right? then why is it on the ONLY good song on the cd (Hey Baby) is Gwen The Only one who has anything to do with that song? she is amazing and the group is GREAT but come on we want something like ""Don't Speak"" & ""Spider Webs"" and the only song this seems to offer up is Hey Baby"
1,No doubt about it the old no doubt is better,I didn't like any song on this cd I was extremly disappointed cuz Im a huge No doubt fan But the old stuff is way better!!! So if ur lookin for some tight rock Try Tragic Kingdom or Return 2 saturn cuz Rock Steady isnt cuttin it.
2,"Disappointing... obviously rushed... monotonous, bland","Sigh...I know that No Doubt can do better than this -- witness their previous 2 albums, which are awesome!But this album is a disappointment. The melodies are centered around a handful of notes, typically 1 octave in range, repeating ad nausea. The lyrics are a poor excuse -- Gwen should have just hummed, and spared us the monotony. At least half the songs consist of a SINGLE PHRASE that is repeated 20-30 times, then faded out.Obviously the didn't have enough time to 1) come up with interesting lyrics, 2) come up with exciting melodies, or 3) ponder intros and endings to these songs (several of which just fade in, then fade out). I feel like I'm listening to ELEVATOR MUZAK! (Sorry, No Doubt -- I love your other albums, I do!)Sure looks like they rushed this out for Christmas 2001, to make their record label happy. It won't be spending much time in my CD player..."
2,"If you're 14, and you like Britney Spears, go for it.",But if you enjoyed the No Doubt of the 90s..that ska/punk group with the wicked vocals... Go buy some other ska albums! Do not support this...crud. I'm sorry but I have lost a LOT respect for No Doubt. They've turned into a band out just for the money (which is in the younger teenage crowd) rather than the music. Shame on you No Doubt. Shame on you!
1,The Whooping Collar,"Decent angling is something every customer has a right to expect. As James M. McPherson writes in Crossroads of Freedom, ""The detritus of battle lay thickly on the field: smashed weapons and gun carriages, dead horses, scraps of bloody clothing, discarded knapsacks and blanket rolls, and the smell of rotting corpses, vomit, and excrement."" This was his most revolutionary statement. If you close your eyes and make an allegation, someday it might come true...that is, of course, when they wear a little tie clip we're meant to take as a kind of emotional chastity belt. Otherwise, it's only the third attempt to disturb our sleep.Which is why I consider this album a masterpiece of thanatopsis. No stars are good enough for it."
2,A huge disappointment,this cd was a huge disappointment. The lyrics had no substance or meaning or even story for that matter. Its a bunch of ramblings made to sell cds and sadly it worked. If you want decent no doubt buy tragic kingdom but please don't waste money on this
2,Don't complain about Britney Spears if you like this.,"All I have to say to those who like this. Quit bellyaching about Britney Spears. Ok so maybe No Doubt write their own songs but would you complain less about Britney if she did. I think not.No Doubt have reduced themselves to young pop artists status here.Now all is not lost here, I like some of the songs like Keep On Dancing. Let's get a remix going. Hey Baby is catchy but it is more silly than any Britney song. Stefani's vocals are not really any better thatn Mrs. Spears either.This is a fun cd. Hit me baby one more time!"
2,Two spins on the carousel - No more,"Unlike Tragic Kingdom & Return of Saturn (both of which retained a spot in my 5 disc carousel for 6 weeks ) Rock Steady does not work for me. Could it be that irratating reggae groove on more than one track? Could it be that I bought this CD the week of its release? (I bought the others months after their debut and loved them) Am I getting to old to be hip? -- I don't think so. It's just this ""the disc is not what I expected of No Doubt after ROS.""No Doubt , No Doubt wherever you are!?"
2,Too much MTV influence....,"I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer that pointed out the MTV and TRL influences. That can be the only explanation for this disappointing album.I had originally hoped that the atrocious first single ""Hey Baby"" was not indicative of the quality of the album. The album as a whole is only a little better than the single. I'm not a music critic at all but this album is missing a lot of the emotion and dare I say maturity of Return to Saturn. Instead, the lazy lyrics and music writing are a giant step backwards to initiate a new generation of Gwenabies that don't expect too much from their music.I really hope Gwen doesn't turn into one of those people that still dresses like a teenager when she is 40."
5,Not a classic but great anyway!,"""Rock Steady"" is not as good as ""Tragic Kingdom"". That doesn't mean that it's a sell out people! No Doubt have nothing to sell out from! Tragic Kingdom was a gigantic commericial hit, and Return Of Saturn was critically acclaimed. So get your facts together! Anyway, this album is a pop/reggae/tri hop experiment. No Doubt doesn't always have to be alternative pop/rock people! Besides, they've got ""Platinum Blonde Life"" on here, don't they? Maybe instead of glorifying Gwen and Tony's break up or singing about a near thirty year old woman's life they wanted to dance and have fun! Why is that such a bad thing? This album is very nice (though I wish the band was more visible; a lot of songs on the album are basically Gwen and a synthesized beat. Makes ya wonder what the guys did while the CD was being recorded). My fave tracks are Hella Good, In My Head, and Detective. This album is way better than it's three and a half stars average rating makes it seem like."
1,All I can say is...,"Gwen has gone from lyrics like ""Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin', so please stop explaining, don't tell me cause it hurts"" to ""All the girl wanna get with the boys, and the boys really like it"". No matter what she says, Gwen is not the same."
3,Oh no!,"Let's not go overboard here. Its not bad enough to deserve a 1-star review, but not worthy of these 5-star reviews either. No Doubt should have written the sound track for ""That 80'S Show"". Rock Steady is a giant leap backwards for the band. I personally, being a big No Doubt fan, am disappointed with this album, because I dont like hip-hop. If you do, than you may love this album. The guitar has been replaced by keyboards sporting sounds we haven't heard since MC Hammer. At the same time, I am glad they did new stuff as far as lyrics. I was getting kinda tired of hearing all about Gwen's love life, but she's looking better than ever!"
2,Very bad,"No, this is not NO Doubt. This CD is one of the worst CDs I have. There are only 2 songs that I like, and even those songs get old after listening to them a couple times. All the songs sound like pure pop, not hard rock. Even Avril Laveign is closer to rock than these songs. What ever happened to the good songs like ""Just a Girl"" and ""Excuse Me"". I think this group needs to give up on the whole ""pop"" thing and go back to what they were good at. ROCK."
1,"Any way you look at this album, it is just plain old bad.","Is it because No Doubt has moved on and left its old fans behind? I don't think so, because it is just a bad album thru and thru."
1,Pathetically shallow CD for a pathetically shallow &#65533;band&#65533;,"This is without a doubt (no pun intended) the most immature and pedestrian CD I've ever heard. The songs have unintelligent lyrics and don't really say much about anything. You don't even need to listen to the CD to tell this, just look at the song titles. ""Making Out""? ""Platinum Blond Life""? I mean, come on! Music is supposed to be an expression that makes you think. These songs are fit for a seventh grade dance. Real rock fans will know that ""Rock Steady"" is a (...) imitation that is trying to appeal to a pop and rock audience. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,worst than ever,....ok when I heard their first 3 album I liked them....but this is a totally wrong thing....it dkfkfj
1,POOR,I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD. I WAS SENT A BURNED COPY AND NOT THE ORIGINAL. I FEEL THAT THE SELLER DEFINATELY MISREPRESENTED HIMSELF AND DID IT PURPOSELY.
2,drives you mad!,"This is one of those albums that can drive you crazy. It contains a couple of the best songs No Doubt have ever done (""Hella Good"", ""Waiting Room""), but it's balanced off by a handful of the worst tracks they've ever laid down (leading the way in this category is the immediately grating first single, ""Hey Baby""). Maybe I'm in the minority, but I thought Return Of Saturn was a really strong CD and a great direction for the band. I feel like this is a step backward for them."
1,Compare this to the older stuff,"No Doubt was my all time favorite band. I discovered TK two years ago, and I was hooked. I instantly got ROS, Beacon Street, and their self titled. They were a ska band back then, with some punk influences. They had music you could rock out to.Hey Baby is a really weird song. It sounds like a high pitched Britney or something. THIS ALBUM IS POP. Pop can be good sometimes (barely ever though) but this is sellout-pop. When you were ska and punk, and suddenly go pop because the loyal fans are getting older and the teenyboppers rule the world, you are selling out.I don't hate ND. I still listen to Beacon Street and ROS and enjoy it. But I know that when I go to their concert in October I probably won't sing too much Rock Steady, and hopefully they'll do much more old stuff... I doubt it though. So now my favorite band is Radiohead, who I know will definitely not go pop, and it comforts me."
3,Not as Good,"I own every No Doubt cd and this one is their poorest so far. Self-Titled, Beacon Street and Tragic Kingdom are two classic cds that everyone should own. Return of Saturn was mellow, but still original and full of great sound. But, Rock Steady lacks so many things that the other cds possess. The band is hardly noticable and if I had never heard of No Doubt and this was the first cd by them I purchased, I would think Gwen Stefani was a solo act. Don't get me wrong, I love her vocals and writing/music ability. But, there is more to No Doubt than her. This cd is too much synth and not enough band."
1,sad.,"this album is so awful! it is very very horrible. i only really like 2 songs, 'Underneath It All', and 'Running' ... I like No Doubt's first album. I really really love 'The Beacon Street Collection'. 'Tradgic Kingdom' is a mid 90's classic and I love it. 'Return of Saturn' is the greatest NO Doubt album ever. It is amazing. No Doubt rules, but 'Rock Steady' is just terrible. hardcore no doubt fans like it because they will like anything that is no doubt. other than that this music is good for little teenage girls. not for real music lovers ... buy any other no doubt album besides this."
3,A good new wave album.,"Wow, remember when No Doubt was a ska band from Orange County? No, not during Tragic Kingdom, but before. Anyway, the band has been steadily moving towards a new wave style and this album is just about almost all new wave. The best song is the only one not new wave, ""Underneath It All,"" which is more of a reggae and early ska throwback. If you are looking for Tragic Kingdom and didn't like the direction Return of Saturn took, then don't get this album. It is definately something different than what is all out there, but I still recommend it if you are looking for that sort of thing."
2,i know how you feel,"no doubt has changed. at first i felt betrayed but ive had some time to cope and im ok with it. gwen is so watered down on this cd, she only sings about partying. some of the songs are good but this is no tragic kingdom or return of saturn. best tracks: in my head, platinum blond life. there are a lot of good songs on here, but dont expect to think about anything real or be able to apply the lyrics to your life or what youre feeling, unless youre a jetsetting trillionare play girl-popstar."
5,Awesome CD!! Very good songs...,"Although I didn't like ""Hey Baby"" all that much when it came out, my boyfriend bought me the CD for my birthday in Feb & I LOVE it!! All the songs are good... I listen to the CD over & over again.. a must have for No Doubt fans. Very funky sounds to it!"
2,It's ok...not as good as Tragic Kingdom!,"I gave this rating a 2-star because there are still some good tracks in this song such as ""Hey Baby"", ""Hella Good"" and ""Underneath it All"", but other than that all the other songs are really not that good to listen to.Some of the songs are really annoying such as ""Detective"" and ""Platinum Blonde Life"". After listening to their previous albums such as ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Return To Saturn"", this cd seemed like a get down for the fans. Songs like ""Just a Girl"", ""Don't Speak"", ""Tragic Kingdom"" were classics compared to the songs in this album! This album is more of pop than rock, which doesnt suit them very well.So, listen to this album only of you are a die'hard No Doubt fan, otherwise your not missing much!"
1,BOO!!!!!!,"This album is a disappointment. There really aren't any good songs. The album is very repetative and boring. I recomend Tragic Kingdom to first time listeners. And to the old fans of No Doubt...Remember the first album,self-titled, Maybe their next album will be better."
5,THIS CD MIXES SO MANY SOUNDS TOGETHER : ),"I love this CD!! It has every type of sound in it!!If you like this CD I reccomend: all No Doubt CDs & Imports, Nikka Costa-Everybody Got Their Something, all Kelis CDs & Imports, Moby-Play & South Side (ft. Gwen), Lina-Stranger on Earth, Poe-Hello & Haunted!!P.S. - There R 2 different covers, but they both have same songs!!"
5,EXCELLENT CD,"I was never a fan of NO DOUBT, but after seeing some of the videos for the tracks on this album I decided to buy it. I'm very happy with my decision. This is an awesome cd. I can honestly say that I LOVE nearly all of the of the songs here and the rest aren't terrible either. My favorite is track 5-- with Lady Saw--this in one cd you won't tire of quickly. Needless to say I, highly recommened it!"
3,For all those who downloaded it...,"Note that this album contains songs, similar to the songs from Eminem's new album, that are somehow copy protected on the CD, which means that the MP3's you download are just repetitions of the same 15 or 20 second portion, so please don't judge the album unless you have really listened to the actual CD."
4,Good Beat/Rythym,"If you've been a long No Doubt fan, based on the other reviews ur probably not gonna like this. However, if you're like me, and never been a heavy No Doubt fan, u might.I really like the beat to this; I like the sound of the songs. I like the rock/pop and just the sound. It makes me wanna dance. This CD is good, I think. But I've never really been a No Doubt fan."
5,perfect to play at a party!,"never has anyone seen such a band quite as unique as no doubt, ever since their debut for ""trapped in a box""...and their music gets better and better! rock steady is a kick ass album with many good tunes like ""hey baby"", ""underneath it all"", ""waiting room"" and ""hella good"". its not just all ska or rock, there is a bit of a mix of everything which makes this album unique and worth listening to. this is the type of album that i'll listen to when i'm feeling down cuz the beat will put you in a good mood! i also find it perfect to play at a party. i'm really looking forward to more great no doubt albums to come!"
4,No Doubt About it...,"This band knows how to, as Pink might cheer, ""get the party started""! Gwen has never sounded more carefree and sure of herself. The rest of the band has fun with the music and thus make a very satisfying record. ""Hella Good"" is by far my favorite...right now. ""Hey Baby"" is a great alternative to all the other songs currently being played on the radio!"
2,one song,"I've heard ""Hey Baby"" on the radio and absolutely love the song.However after listening to the samples of the other songs online, I surely won't pay the bucks for this CD.Of course the durations of the samples leave a lot to be desired.But what should I do -- hope for the best? Nah, I'll save my money and ""maybe"" buy the single if/when it comes out. That is doubtful as well. I don't like an entire CD platter for a single song even if it's great.VERY INTERESTING that they have used CDs for sale when this thing was only released a few days ago."
4,This is album is Rock Steady!,"What can I say, I love this album. I would have given it 5 starts, but there are two song on the album, that I do not like. From what i can unsderstand from the previous reviews, the people who gave ""Rock Steady"", bad reviews are people who are die-hard No-Doubt fans, and they feel let down by the material on this album.Well I love No-Doubt, but I am also a person of ecclectic taste, and i found the songs covered in ""Rock Steady"", to be beautiful. They did a wonderful job with the combination of reagge, dance hall, 80's synth-pop, and rock. I definitely, like this album more than ""Return To Saturn"", which I tought was a real dissapointment."
5,"No Doubt does it again, in a different way","I am a longtime fan of No Doubt, and I have been waiting for Rock Steady for months. I am very excited about it, though I have to admit that the sound is much different from No Doubt's previous work. It is has a lot of reggae influence with electronic sounds as well. Ska it is not, but you could never really fit No Doubt into a category. I think that is part of their appeal. I have enjoyed the CD a great deal and I highly recommend it to any No Doubt fan. Well, I highly recommend it to anybody - the music is fun and catchy and is a pleasant departure from Britney Spears."
2,Sell-Out............... I'm Truly Dissappointed!!!,"I have always been a No Doubt fan, ever since Tragic Kingdom, their first big success. Return of saturn was a powerfull follow-up record, and my personnal favorite. However No Doubts' latest Rock Steady is a huge dissappointment to me!!! What happened to the skaw-grunge-great rock sound known to the bands earlier success??? That was the No Doubt that I loved, and will always love! To me this record is a true sell-out!!! It sounds like all the other hip-hoppy-poppy junk out there! with songs like ""hella good"" and ""making out"" and not to mention ""hey baby"" give me a break! I only hope the real No Doubt comes back soon, I really liked them!!! Oh, if you like No Doubt, do not buy this record! The 2 stars in my review stand for ""COME BACK""!!!"
3,It rocks but not so steady,"This isn't a bad CD, it just doesn't live up to the singles or the last effort. Gwen Stefani said they were out to make a CD they could dance to. They did, that much is true. But I do not find this CD making it's way into my CD player often. I enjoy the singles as they are heavily played on the radio but I have little need to listen to the rest. I would take either of their last two CDs over this one. But if you are a die-hard No Doubt fan, don't let this review stop you. Gwen is definitely captivating in everything she does."
5,"No Doubt kicks hiney on this new cd, love the new sound!","I have loved No doubt for 9 years, everything they do is great. This new album is fantastic, Gwen has mastered her voice and Tom, Adrian, and Tony have improved their instrumentation since the beginning of No Doubt. I love the new sounds and highly reccomend it to everyone."
3,more Pop-rocks than Rock Steady.... 3 1/2 stars,"Well, it certainly is a bit different, but different is not always better. This is probably their most Pop-like outing.With more ""dance music"" friendly songs than the ska music they used to do aside from their melodic ballads. As for the intro to some of the songs like ""Running"", ""Platinum Blonde"", and ""Rock Steady"" the synthesized, rather than authentic guitars, sounds like video game music sampled straight from Super Mario Bros which really annoyed me on ""Running"" because this song could've been an amazing track. It worked for ""Rock Steady"", though.Overall, the album works out well, but nothing spectacular. Best tracks on this album are ""Hella good"" and ""Rock Steady"""
4,No Doubt in one word...,"So the ska thing was put to rest for awhile so Gwen could write some deeper songs for ""Saturn"" and now the band has decided now is the time to just crank up the volume and have FUN! That's exactly what they did...ROCK STEADY is a cd that is nothing but fun that just makes you want to sing at the top of your lungs and dance. From first single HEY BABY to the rocker PLATINUM BLONDE LIFE this cd is solid No Doubt, giving a taste of the true mood of this party band. Only one or two tracks failed to inspire a good mood from me, even though they tried pretty hard. We love them when they're doing simple things like MARRY ME (From ""Saturn"") but this is what it's all about...everyone just relax and have some fun!"
3,New Direction For No Doubt,"Where's the rock? Rock Steady is very synth-based, disco-y sound as compared to their guitar-driven previous albums. They do however maintain their reggae roots. Gwen is, as always, the focal point of the CD, but this effort seems to have Gwen solo album written all over it. Too many disco collaborations with other artists have spoiled poor Gwen."
3,I know my No Doubt.,"I have been a fan of No Doubt for over 10 years - This album, though not NEARLY close to thweir best - is great...if you like dancehall reggae and club music. If you are an old school no doubt fan (Beacon street, self titled, etc...) it might take some getting used to. Definately less depressing than Return of Saturn, not as punky as Tragic Kingdom, nothing close to Beacon Street or the self-titled album....It's good. Plain and simple."
3,"A Little Disappointed, but . . .","Okey-dokey . . . I became a No Doubt fan way back whenever because I liked their funky-fun ska-style music circa _No Doubt_ and _Beacon Street Collection_, so Rocksteady sort of took me by surprise. ""Hella Good,"" ""Making Out,"" and ""Underneath It All"" were enjoyable, but some of the songs were just a little too blinged-out for me, and the entire album was almost completely devoid of any ska elements from their previos releases. Even Return of Saturn still had a lot of ska beats and horns in it. The only song I could really do without was ""Hey Baby."" Just not my cup of tea.I guess I'm disappointed mostly because I was expecting ska (it's called ""Rocksteady"" for crying out loud!) and I got some blingin' r&b party music instead."
5,There is 'No Doubt' this is their best CD yet,"This is a must own for any No Doubt lover. My girlfriend is a huge fan of No Doubt and has all their cd's, and after listening to them over a period of time I got hooked on them. I am a converted No Doubt lover. My girlfriend and I are apart a lot of the time because we go to different universities, but no matter how far the distance, we know we can always listen to this album to remind ourselves about one another with brilliant magnifcient songs like: ""Underneath It All"", and my favorite ""Don't Let Me Down"". I think ""Running"" is their best song on the track and I love its lyrics because anyone whos ever been in a long distance relationship can relate to this song. ""Rock Steady"", ""Hey Baby"", ""In My Head"" are all also great. All the tracks are awesome. I can listen to this CD from begining to end and play it over and over again. Now thats when you know its an Awesome Cd. This should be in everyone's CD collection."
4,Some Doubt Remains,"Rock Steady by No Doubt is a mixture of good tracks with some rather fluffy, insubstantial, not too creative stuff. The album begins with some catchy, energetic tunes: Hella, Hey Baby, Making Out. Underneath it All is a slower, crooning tune. Thereafter, the album doesn't really have much punch. Detective is kinda catchy, but also silly. Don't Let Me Down and In My Head and light and bouncy. Platinum Blonde Life has a good rock edge and is a good tune to have toward the end for some balance. Overall, a very listenable album, but doesn't register too much impact on the listener. Tragic Kingdom was more forceful."
4,PRETTY GOOD!,"i have to admit, that its highly annoying when people compare this cd to tragic kingdom. you cant expect an artist's style to stay the same for ten years. thats just complete crap.anywho, although, this clearly isnt their best album (in my opinion, RETURN OF SATURN, is the best. has that great ska feel), its still a delight to listen to.my favorite songs are:in my head- this song is a bit sad, but i love it. i love the line ""and sometimes i think that cupid is just taking a piss"". i know its childish, blah blah blah, but its funny.hella good- pretty good song. best single from this album that they released. the moaning in the background is slightly disturbing though.rock steady- great song. nice feel."
4,Wow,"This album has more of a dance feel then Tragic Kingdom (the only other ND album I have) but this album is good.1.Intro-It's a 27 second intro, starts the same way as Rock Steady (13th track) and I think this should've been an interlude for rock steady. 10/102.Hella Good-Probably my favorite song. This is getting played on certain stations a lot, but this is still a good song. 9/103.Hey Baby featuring Bounty Killer-This is the 1st single and it's a REALLY good song.10/104.Making Out-The chorus gets old fast, but the verses are nice. 8/105.Underneath It All- 2nd single, and it's an ok song. 7/106.Detective-Awesome song! 10/107.Don't Let Me Down-This song just gets really dull. 6/108.Start The Fire-This song is so BORING! 2/109.Running-Sweet. 8/1010.In My Head-Better then 'Running'. 10/1011.Platinum Blonde Life-This song is awesome, even though I'm not blonde! 10/1012.Waiting Room-Boring. 4/1013.Rock Steady-GREAT song. 9/10113/130=4 stars"
5,Rockin With No Doubt,"A lot are quick to judge this cd, but I bought this on a whim (plus being a fan of No Doubt helped out) and I can honestly say I am not at all disapointed. ROCK STEADY is a breath of fresh air. The band is evolving and trying new things, and this CD is a result of the good mood they were in during the RETURN OF SATURN tour. They wanted us to dance, well I'm dancing so they succeeded. My favorite song would either be the Prince produced ""Waiting Room"", which to put it mildly, is hot. I also like ""Running"" quite a bit, which in my opinion is Gwen's most vocally endearing song to date. ""Hey Baby"", ""Making It Out"" and ""Underneath it All"" are also great songs. The CD is a mixture of punk and ska, with electonic beats with the help of producers by the likes of William Orbit, Prince, Nellee Hooper, and more. Overall its a worthwhile buy. Give this one a listen!"
1,rubbish,"You can picture the scene really can't you? Gwen orders the rest of the band into a meeting and annouces ""we're going to make this album a little bit diffrent im getting some my ourageously cool mates,you know like william orbit to work with on the songs"" then the drummer pipes up(rather bravely) i don't i want to play ska-punk and then 2 hours later after gwen as demonstrated why she is god they 'agree' to make this album.such a waste really because it really is overproduced ...electro music."
2,what happened to ska?,"This CD's first single ""Hey Baby"" is obnoxious to say the least, although because I am such a loyal fan I ignored the warning signs and bought it anyway, I should have known better. This CD is one of the worst reggae-pop mixes I have ever heard. I know that the ska-punk scene is forever changing and for that reason I supported the change in style found on their last CD. After ""Return to Saturn"" I figured No Doubt was maturing, but this set back totally killed my support for them. Honestly the vocals are so-so and Gwen's signature voice does a decent job of carrying a tune, but the lyrics in songs like ""Hella-Good"" make me want to vomit and for that reason alone I would suggest people stay away from this calamity."
1,One Star is Generous,"If you'd like to have this album without buying it, you can just download the 30 second samples from Amazon.com and then loop them a few times over. That's all this album is - mindless looping. I would guess that, minus the loops, this album is maybe 10 to 15 minutes long, if that. Oh, what a piece of trash this album is. Other No Doubt albums are MUCH better."
5,'No Doubt 'They are the best Band Around,"I loved this band from the first time I heard Tragic Kingdom. Gwen Stefani has a voice you're either going to get into or not. I happen to think it's great. She puts so much drama into just a single lyric. I knew Don't speak was destined to become a classic from the very first time I heard it. The rest of the band rocks to the hilt. All the songs have a great techno/rock feel. I still listen to this CD everyday. It's uplifting and full of hi-enrgy. No Doubt will still be making great music for a long time to come, while the other teeny bopper bands on the current scene fade into the sunset."
3,Rock on,I liked this cd because it is rock and pop. It isn't like Britney Spears and it's not heavy medal like Metalica.
4,Tight mix-up.,"I really love this CD, even though ""Tragic Kingdom"" is my favorite of No Doubt's albums. I love the mix and clash of different genres of music that they put on this album, it's really ill. I was really impressed by Gwen too. She's really enigmatic to me, I love her style and her sex appeal. Work it out!"
4,GMC Step bars,"These step bars are great! The black looks great with my black truck, good solid fit, easy to install and seems to be holding up well. Recommend these bars to improve your truck."
4,westin 25-1685 signature step bars- black,fit and finish are very good.30 mintutes to install.over one hundred dollars cheaper than eveywhere else i looked.
