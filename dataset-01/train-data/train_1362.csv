3,will you ever stop whining?!?,I can't believe the WHINING going on about this deal. Maybe Wal-Mart does sell the same product...FOR 20 BUCKS MORE!! Try complaining about something worth while for once. The quality of my product was well worth the $19.99 I paid for it. My toaster cost me more! I'm sure any guest in my house will also appreciate new bedding during their stay as well. Thanks for the AFFORDABLE bedding guys!
4,Not For Cocktail Parties,"An intriguing (if occasionally grating) collection of early electronic music from the classic film. Good for background music while you read sci-fi or surf the net. And isn't ""Robby Arranges Flowers, Zaps Monkey"" a killer song title?"
4,Campise is a great musician,"4.5 starsThis is one of many solid outings from Texas jazzman Campise.Equally at home on alto, tenor, soprano, flute, and bass flute (how many reedmen can say that?), Tony is a truly fine player with a mellifluous style and chops to spare. He moves from straight-up Bird-style blowing to lush ballads in a flash, and plays everything with soul. He is also a wonderfully kind and funny guy.Tony plays a monthly gig here in Austin at our little jazz hole, the Elephant Room. If you get a chance, check him out. His playing has only improved with age, and he has a relaxed humor onstage that makes his gigs a true delight.Campise is one of the most musical musicians in Austin, and that's mighty fine indeed.Long may he wail."
3,Nice idea but badly executed,"I agree that the photos are wonderful. However, the editors/writers aren't very skilled in astronomy, or even checking accuracy. The concept of the book is to link the star photos to other photos of higher resolution and to append to that a useful paragraph of info. Unfortunately, the circled areas on the main photo (using the plastic overlay) often do not match the same field as the referenced close-up photo. Moreover, the text is often too little, unrelated, or just plain weak. It would have been very easy to get this right but that didn't happen in this edition; very frustrating. So, if you like awesome photos then the book is nice; as an astronomical tool it is fairly useless. Let's hope the next edition does better."
4,Not truly an Atlas,"This is really a series of outstanding photos of 30 selected constellations of the sky. Selected stars or objects in these photos are interestingly narrated. This is not really a map of the complete celestial sphere and there are no declination lines, no hour circles, and no ecliptic. Imagine, if you will, a book calling itself the Great Atlas of the United States. However it consists of beautiful, interestingly narrated maps of only 30 of the states, each separately shown. Not shown: latitude, longitude, and position relative to the rest of the country. However if locating the constellation in question is already solved elsewhere and if you want to explore interesting objects therein, then this is an outstanding book."
5,"Soulful, fresh, but retains the integrity of the music.","For one so young, she has the integrity of the 40's singers towards the music. She understands what she is singing. She is interpretive; has been influenced by those who came before, but never copies and has a fresh approach to the music. She sets a mood and keeps you there whether it is a soulful jazz ballad like ""One for My Baby"", or scatting an uptempo arrangement of ""Love for Sale."" Her musicality and musicianship are undeniable. If you are not in love, her sensual treatment of romantic ballads makes you wish you were."
3,Decent enough...,"This one didn't bowl me over or anything, but it a very nice, very pleasant Cd to listen to. A handful of good songs in there. Nothing really stood out to be honest, but I sure can't find any flaws either."
3,"Great espresso, pods are a pain.","First, I should say that this is possibly the best espresso I have ever made at home. Everything about it makes for the best cup I could wish for. Having transitioned from Starbucks ESE pods, to Illy, and now this - this espresso taste and experience is by far the best.HOWEVER, every pod I have opened has not been packed tightly enough. So, the first few times I made this espresso, it was horrible. When I figured out the issue, I have had to open up every pod, dump it into my basket, tamp it down, and make it. This, obviously, is completely the opposite point of having the pods. Having used several other companies' pods, it is easy to see (once I ruined a few initial tries) that these pods are significantly looser than anyone else'. I will not buy the Bristot pods again, but will instead look for just loose grounds, in a can or bag.GREAT ESPRESSO when it is packed right - would never suggest the pods."
2,crap er natural?,"ABK isnt a very good MC or singer, and this cd wasnt very good in the first place, a revised version is just 6 new verses and 18 more wasted dollars."
4,liked cd,The only reasion everybody disses on this cd is because everybody's pissed off because it is not that much different than the 1 one. The people who own the first one and bought the 2 thinking that it is different got screwed over.I think if Tales From The Lotus Pod Revised came out first no one would have diss on it.
5,Marz Vs Abk,Who cares If Marz was on the original That Doesnt Make Him Better they are both good cds. everybody has there own oppinion.i honestly like the abk version better but i still love the marz version.this stupid argument is tearing the juggalo family apart iluv yall but jeez get over it its a cd keep your oppinion to yourself so we can put this behind usMMFCL
5,This is the better version...,"1. Intro---Same on both..Could have been alittle more original..2. Ali-Ba-Ba---ABK DID WAYY Better than marz on this.3. Something---A recycled beat yet still good.4. Hurt Myself----A perfect song. Monoxide shines over all on this one.5. Call Upon Your Gods---Madrox rules this track, This is the only track that Marz did better than ABK6. We Danced---Funny7. cigaM kcalB---Sort of like Echoe side with every member putting in except Blaze and Abk8. Gimme Dat Blood----Funny, Not there most original idea..9. Headache---THE BEST SONG ON THE CD AND BY ANY PSHYCOPATHIC ARTIST10. Bad Rep---Great song...11. Bitch I'm Sexy-------Funny as hell12. Swarm---The 2nd best song on the album..13. I Wanna Die---resembles Alright by Twiztid14. Black Crows---This song is by the first 4 members of the lotus. Twiztid and ICP15. Juggalo Family---The title says it all..This song is about Family16. .Com--A shout out to the websites."
2,eh...,it's the same as tales from the lotus pod except maybe just a couple of new lines in the songs. Don't get me wrong ABK is dope but i really think no one could top off Marz on that cd.They even took out his parts in bitch im sexyReally don't buy this unless you don't have the other versionit's just a waste of moneyBlack Rain was Fresh tooI wonder if they'll do another ABK is gone nowMaybe someone from AMB will fill in
5,We love this game,I bought this game for our summer camp as a rainy day game. It was a HUGE hit! I had to force the kids and teachers to stop playing. They loved it. That was ages 7-10. I bought one for myself and several of the teachers bought their own for their famlies. We took it on vacation and have played it at a slumber party. Every group has loved the competition. It's easy and fun for the whole group.
4,Everyone knows Spoons!,Gave as a gift to 3 young boys-they love the game and this one comes with oversize spoons. This is tailor made for for young kids.
5,Giant Spoons Game,Our family loves the Giant Spoons Game. The big plastic spoons are much safer than using spoons from the kitchen!
5,great toy,We bought this toy several years ago and whenever the grandchildren come we pull it out to play. The giant spoons are really easy for the little grandchildren to play. A great game for children and adults.
1,It's Junk,"Bought this T.V. at the world's largest retailer on 12/14/02 and paid $1565.62 including sales tax for it. I have had to have the convergence chips replaced THREE times to date (10/17/09), each time costing $175 to $200. The repairman doesn't know if the circuit board can handle a fourth replacement. The repairman told me that the Philips brand may have been bought out by another electronics corporation. I like their corporate motto- ""Let's make things better."" It certainly applies in this case and if they want to make things better for me they can refund my money and come and pick up the set."
1,Avoid this TV,"Thought I was getting a great TV at a great price. I had this TV for less than three years, with NOT a lot of viewing time on it and a major component goes out on it that caused red blurry images. The cost to fix this ($400+) was too much considering the value of the TV. If you want a nice picture and TV for a couple of years and then have it break, then this TV is for you. If you want a quality product that will last longer than a typical Hollywood marriage, avoid this TV like the plague."
4,I Love It,"I was hesitant to purchase this HDPTV, based on the size and the cost. I was scared I would be purchasing a lemon...This is not the case, I love my TV, it is very user friendly and shows a great picture...It has different viewing options for movies, If doesn't have a any glare, it's light and very easy to relocate if needed. You will not be disappointed in your purchase."
3,Disappointed,"Advertised to voice translate on Palm OS system as well as pocket PC but the voice to voice translation only works on the pocket PC (too bad I own the palm!) Otherwise, all you get is a talking dictionary (not impressed). I wanted a voice-operated translator, I got a dictionary."
3,ok,Make sure you look at the Region. We in the US are in Region 1. This DVD was Region 2. So if I wanted to watch I had to change my DVD player to play it and reset it when I was done.
5,Heart & Soul (VHS) The Monkees,It was in good condition. The vhs tape played well. Excellent packaging.I've been looking for this video for awhile. Thanks.
3,Small Set,"I measured incorrectly and ended up with a much smaller set than I had expected. Be sure to measure your current set diagonally from corner to corner rather than horizontally, which I mistakenly did. I really wanted to return it, but it just wasn't worth the hassle."
1,Unit DOA,I've had greatexperience with Toshiba television products in thepast and wassurprised and disappointed that the unit wasdelivered DOA.
5,Pure enjoyment.,"Though this is a five-hour movie, it is hard to turn away from it once you start watching it. The previous reviewer Cearawrite was right, it's got everything in the story, and in this movie. Ciaran Hinds is just magnificent! His acting in this moive as Brian de Bois Guilbert is irresistible. It is really a pure enjoyment watching this well-made production, though it doestn't have big name Hollywood stars,or a big budget. This great Medieval story, believable characters, and superb acting can easily take you through the whole movie, and then wanting to watch it all over again for another five hours!!"
4,Unexpectedly Watchable,"I went into Ivanhoe assuming I'd watch a few minutes and then switch to something else. I was suprised how easy it was to stay with this. There were a few slow spots, but the series was well paced and easy to enjoy. This production was a lot more realistic looking than most period pieces, where it seems like people spent all of their free time polishing their armor and going to ye olde ancient dry cleaners. I am normally not a fan of Cirian Hinds, but I was blown away by him as de Bois-Guilbert! Susan Lynch, as Rebecca, was wonderful as always.I admit that I have not read the book so I can not comment on the adaptation."
1,The mini-series that somehow managed to get it ALL wrong.,"First of all, I read (several times) the unabridged book and enjoyed it greatly. This ""movie"" is a hatchet job on perhaps the most brilliant tale of chivalry of all time. The book ""Ivanhoe"" was an extremely romanticized portrayal of the 12th century, doing so for literary effect. The movie takes great pains to make you hate the era as brutal and sadistic. Graphic scenes of torture are added; gross historical inaccuracies abound. Any good actors in this film are wasted by an inept adaptation and childish direction."
5,SIR WALTER SCOTT'S IVANHOE,I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL AND MILITARY MOVIES VERY MUCH. I ENJOY THE TIME PERIOD OF THE ENGLISH KNIGHTS.
1,"I liked Scott's Rowena, not this immature jealous shrew...","The coolest thing about Walter Scott's Ivanhoe was that Rebecca and Rowena both loved Ivanhoe, both knew only one could have him, both knew which of them it could be, and admired and respected each other enough to not act like middle school girls about him. This TV Rowena could only have been written by someone in the 1990's entertainment industry. The 1982 version, with Lisette Anthony in the role, has a Rowena with integrity."
1,A rather unintentionally stupid film,"I tried to watch this film but could not finish it. Afterward I set to reading the unabridged book ""Ivanhoe"". I found the book to be infinitely superior.There were many gross (and I do mean gross)innacuracies and deviations from the origional book.For one, the melee combat. In the movie the fim makers claimed the Normans cheated by using daggers during the melee which never happened in the book. The Normans were actually noble opponents.And then there was Font de Beof's burning death scene. It is shown in beyond graphic detail. Sir Walter Scott (I'm going from memory here so excuse the paraphrasing) said of that scene: To describe the scene would be unchristian.A character is added for the sole purpose of being beheaded just to show how mean and nasty the villains are. We already knew that considering they kidnapped, murdered and stole.I could go on longer about this but to sum it all up, a very poor adaptaion of the wonderful book Ivanhoe"
3,The transfer on DVD leaves MUCH to be desired.,"No complaint about the quality of the production itself, or the sets, costumes, etc. Much has been written about that already and I cannot really add much to those.What I can do is voice my considerable disappointment with the visual quality of the DVD transfer itself. On a really good widescreen plasma Panasonic, the picture looks like (shall I be honest?) badly-focused crap. The contrast ratios are poor, the colors are not vibrant, and the whole thing looks, well, poorly done. I don't which are worse -- the low-light settings, which look muddy and out of focus, or the brightly-lit scenes, with the bad depth-of-field, lack of focus, and poor color saturation.I notice that many of the criticisms of this production characterize it as insiped, dull, flat, and boring. Perhaps that is less the fault of the screenplay and the acting than it is of the visual presentation, which is all of those things. Too bad."
3,"Overall, I didn't like it.","It failed to meet my expectations. The 1952 version is superior to me in every way. I wish a reviewer said this so I could have stopped myself from buying this. I should have just waited for the 1952 version.I won't bother compairing it to the book, coz we should have all realized by now that movie adaptations should never be compaired to the book, it's like compairing apples with oranges...totally different media, one appeals to vision and hearing, the other to one's own imagination.Ivanhoe looked too much of weakling to me, I thought his father was the more knightly. But admittedly, the acting was descent, 5 hours is OK if you have nothing better to watch, but the whole movie failed to capture me.Bottom line: I recommend renting before buying."
1,boring,"As another reviewer noted, the DVD transfer is quite terrible -- its really a mediocre VHS transfer.There's something boring about this whole movie, but it is hard to put one's finger on it -- it may be that we are just spoiled for bigness with such themes as the Crusades, etc. It needs a whole pile of money thrown at it. This version is grubby (which is more like reality, but who wants reality? And Monty Python kind of killed the grubby peasant movie style anyway). The Robert Taylor Ivanhoe is a completely ridiculous movie, but it has a whole lot of zing to it (especially Elizabeth Taylor at her most incredibly luscious, omigod) that this TV thing doesn't have."
1,Distasteful rubbish,"What characterizes this movie is an utter lack taste and decorum. The inability to understand that wanton violence does not make a good movie, destroys any shred of regard I might have felt toward the movie.Why is it that every time a messager appears in this movie, he is killed in a prompt, corny and unneccassary fashion that does not keep with the spirit of the book. You would think that all medieval messagers would quit under such conditions!"
1,"Sure, the book takes a few more brain cells but...","It's worth it! The standard excuse for a movie that does not follow the book is that the book was too confusing. That is no excuse for the strange dramatic choices made in this adaptation of Ivanhoe. There have been many movies that manage to capture the spirit and charm of a book without completely gutting the basic personalities of the heroes. I refer to Rebecca's swooning manner (she was a firecracker in the book), Rowena's shouting match with Cedric (she got her way by being sweet and confidant, never by screaming), the Normans cheating at their own tournament (they didn't need to, they were on their own terf and the Saxons had a disadvantage to begin with) See what I mean? Strange dramatic choices.Attempt to slog through the unabridged Ivanhoe, it may take some time and it certainly won;t be brain candy but every character is balanced and developed as only Sir Walter Scott can do it."
2,Poor Interpretation Of Wonderful Story,"The story told in this two DVD set is quite devoid of the elegant writing, witty dialogue, intricate storyline, and the plot's carefully deliberate unfolding that made the book a classic. In fact, this movie is heavy-handed, predictable and focused on cruelty and violence. Also, visually, be prepare, if you are purchasing this set, for a grainy square pictured video. I was obviously disappointed in this purchase. If I was not so interested in stories and movies of this time period, I would have rated it with one star."
2,Glory must mean Gory!,"I bought this DVD in an A&E Romance collection. It would have been better packaged with the ""Guts and Gore"" collection, because there is plenty of gore to be had in it, I assure you. I don't even want to keep the DVD set because I was just so grossed out from all the battle wounds, the head in a bloody sack tossed to the victim's friends and all the full sound effect stabbings and swordfights. I can handle a bit of gore, but this was so graphic and so constant throughout the 300 minute epic that I don't ever want to watch it again."
2,Not great,"This CD was a disappointment for me. I read the other reviews and it looked good, and I'm a big fan of Morgan Heritage. But, the quality's bad and it didn't have great songs in my opinion. I wish I'd bought a different Morgan Heritage CD instead."
5,Mighty fine chess set for the money,"It's well made, with a magnetic closure that keeps it shut. The wooden pieces and board are large enough to not restrict one's view, which is most important to me. I wish it had a foam insert for keeping the pieces, but a freezer bag is sufficient. With five kids, I'm going to get a couple more of these."
2,A little rough,"The wood was not good, it is rough with splits and small chips. One of the hinges was crooked so there is a gap on one side when the board is opened. The game pieces are O.K."
1,Now with Genetically Modified ingredients....,I've used these for years but will be giving them up as Wrigleys admitted to using Genetically Modified ingredients. :(
5,Good deal,"This is a good deal for Altoids, I still haven't finished eating nearly a third of them. Defenitly get this product right now"
1,These sucked!!!,I absolutely LOVE peppermint altoids but the ones I order from amazon left a stale dusty taste in my mouth. They were no where near as fresh as those purchased at my local market
2,Pepperwintermint,What is wrong with the quality control??? My last 6pk of peppermint altoids had about 40% wintergreen intermingled. DISGUSTING!!! There's nothing like expecting peppermint and getting nothing close to it. It's like expecting beer and getting unsweetened tea. Please do something about your QC!
5,"Great mints, great price","I used to buy an individual tin of these every time I ran out, but it was starting to get expensive. Buying a 12-pack is a much better route; it's cheaper and you don't need to run to the store every time you need a new tin. I've ordered a pack of these mints annually for the past three years now.As for the mints themselves, they're perfect. They're small but strong, providing you with a great taste and fresh breath. An excellent product."
2,This product rusts!!!,"This is not a bird bath. It could be used as a feeder, but it needs to be cleaned frequently.Not worth the money!!!!"
5,Dana Osborn is one of the hottest new artists of our decade!,"Although still unknown to many, this bright and talented musician will take your breath away. Walk with me is amazing. The level of emotion he brings to let the rain fall down will take you over the edge time and time again."
4,Just what I wanted...,"This is a great outdoor basketball. I actually ordered 5 of them for my son's school playground. My only complaint is the way they ship them. Even though I get free shipping w/ Prime, it bothered me that each ball shipped in a separate box. Can't we all TRY not waste so much paper/cardboard, etc. Kinda crazy...and I am not even a ""big enviromentalist""...but when I had to break down 5 seperate boxes I thought to myself how silly it was that they weren't all shipped in one box!"
3,Great ball but badly deflated,"When these were rec'd they were deflated and since we don't have anything with that pin hole size to inflate it, we had to wait over a week to use them so I could get to the store and buy something. Which in turn cost me more money because I needed to go to a store and buy one for my son's basketball practices....Sigh! Once inflated the ball was great but to save myself time and money I shopped here, it ended up costing me extra time and money in the end."
2,only for kids,The basketball is made of rubber and it looks nothing like the picture. The surface is hard and your fingers are easily to get hurt. It is a far cry from being satisfied.
1,RUBBER!,"If you play basketball at ALL, you will hate this basketball. It is that hideous rubber material that tears up your hands. The grooves are super deep and are sharp where they go down.The image makes this ball look MUCH better than it really is.This is fine if you just play at home and to shoot around, but it would suck to have to play a game with this indoor or outdoor.."
1,Terrible,"First, I realize that these are an inexpensive outdoor basketball, so I wasn't really expecting a lot...but after only a day on our concrete driveway all 3 of the balls I purchased had gone flat. Not much else to say, not impressed!"
3,"Its okay, Its very tube like rubber.","Its okay, Its very tube like rubber. I wanted something more close to leather. So that's why i think its an okay product."
2,you get what you pay for,this ball wont last 3 weeks with regular use. piece of junk. why would spalding want to put their name on it
4,Good,It's a good basketball with excellent grip for holding. Ball arrives to your home a little flat though.
3,jumping,Yes this ball does wear and tear pretty fast but i only use it to dunk now ever since i try this out [...] so now i don't really worry about it that much
4,Small but nice,I bought this for my son who is just starting out. It is a nice small size and he loves it.
2,I was a bit deflated by this purchase,"I purchased this ball for my 7 year old to play basketball. It arrived ""soft"", at which point I inflated it. It was soft again within about 30 minutes of use, after which I inflated it again, and confirmed it was the ball.Amazon's excellent customer service allowed me to return the item for a full refund, hence I'm not giving this one star. Everything else from Amazon came out great."
3,its ok,"I liked this ball until about a week ago when it was poped when i shot a free throw. I mean this was mabey just a freak thing and i was just unlucky, but it did happen."
2,Loses air very quickly!,"Like others have mentioned, this ball loses air very quickly. I ordered youth size, and it arrived deflated in the box. I pumped it up to 9lbs. Played with the kids, and then put in the closet for the rest of the day. Took it out in the evening, and it was already flat. I will monitor it for a few more days, and if it can't hold up even for a few hours, I'll return it.Other than that it's a nice ball with good grip and bounce."
1,Buy with caution!,I bought this for my younger brother as a gift. He hasn't used it and won't because to our disappointment Amazon had sent out what clearly appears to be a used ball. We're not very happy about this and now will have to go through the hassle of returning it. Wasted time waiting for the package to arrive when we could have purchased it from a local retailer.Thanks Amazon!
2,Better buy an air pump too,"look, this ball feel nice when its pumped up and it releases well off the hand but every time you intend to play you have to put air in it. it's not like it just barely loses air, it completely goes flat after 8 hours of it being pumped. if you don't have a problem filling it up every time you want to use it then by all means get it. you get what you pay for..."
1,not a very good purchase,"I ordered a hoop a couple weeks ago, thought it would be an OK idea to order a basketball at the same time...the ball is no good. It will not hold air."
2,Not great,"Ball isn't supple enough to bounce well. It doesn't matter how much/little air pressure I use, it just doesn't bounce well, and feels heavy and dead. Not a good ball to teach little one's to dribble. It does feel like it will last a long time, even if left outside. But that's not a good trade-off for the poor feel."
1,Ha...should have read the reviews closer...,"See how the picture shows the leather version? Yeah, this is rubber and most definitely the most childish ball I have ever owned. Big disappointment."
3,Varsity Basketball,Basketball looked nothing like the picture. It's a rubber basketball with good grip. Good basketball for outdoors play.
1,do not buy this ball,This ball is misadvertised. It is made of cheap rubber and looks different then the ball in the picture. If you are 4 or younger then this is fine but otherwise get a halfway decent ball.
1,Fell flat,This ball needed air straightout the box. My boys were unable to play with it and now I need to purchase an air pump. Will not purchase again should have brought from a local store.
4,"Good ball, but had black scuff won't come off.","It is a good ball, but has a mark that will not come off. I tried everything I could think of."
3,Decent cheap bball,"Bought this last Christmas, it made it through the summer, but by this point it no longer has any grip. So I got the kids another one this Christmas. At this price ($8.99) I believe we got our value out of it but feel it should have stood up to a little more abuse than it did."
4,A good gift,This was bought for a younger boy from a poor family who was not expecting much this Christmas. He was overjoyed to receive it.
5,"Quellet 10,000 watt heater","I have a 1,000 sq.ft. wood working shop and was concerned about how this heater would perform in such a large area and the wood dust with hot electric coils.This heater exceeded my expectations. within 10 mins. my shop is warm. To my surprise the coils do not glow red hot which eases my mind about wood dust fires. After my shop gets warm, this heater works very well to maintain that temp. with the built in thermostat. Some people have complained about the noisy fan but I don't feel that its a problem, with a fan that throws out 700cfms."
4,Great Heater.,"Heats my 3 stall garage just fine. Garage is insulated with 10 foot ceilings, and with the heater on setting 1 it has no problem maintaining 45 deg or jumpuing up to 60 if I am going to be working out in it. We really haven't had winter in ND yet this year so I am hoping there will be no issues when the temp dips to -20 to -30."
4,"a passionate, innovative and articulate journey into Indian rhythm","""Zakir Hussain & The Rhythm Experience"" is a great World Music album with a focus on Indian percussion. This will resonate with those familiar with Mickey Hart's percussive saga. Zakir Hussain seems to have learned well from his time in Hart's Diga Rhythm Band. In many respects, this could be a more authentic sequel to ""Diga."" More authentic yes, but this is not for the purists. If the listener seeks true authenticity, go with Mahaprush Misra or Bhai Gaitonde; this is World Music. The album features a variety of musical styles including Classical Indian, Jazz, World and even Pop. While a few moments have a cheesy 1980's sounding production, it's minor enough to not spoil the experience as a whole. The percussion and improvisation is spellbinding. This is an essential recording for enthusiasts of the tablas. ""Zakir Hussain & The Rhythm Experience"" is a passionate, innovative and articulate journey into Indian drumming."
2,PATHETIC,"I had to agree with the reader who lost interest when Pamela couldn't tell that the head she had picked up from the highway was an actual one. I found the first half fairly funny, but the road trip and everything afterwards was over the top. It wasn't just the head -- burning down her father's house? Keeping the head all the way to Maine? How stupid can a person be? That I was supposed to sympathize with Pamela's misadventures is insulting. The only bright spot was Abdhul -- he deserved better."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but tries too hard to be funny","This is an odd book that actually makes only passing reference to the title (explained a little towards the end), which I assume is mainly for shock value and to entice you to pick it up (it worked for my friend, who lent it to me).Our anti-heroine is entertaining enough, and at times her trials and tribulations are outright funny, but after a while this all begins to wear a little thin. Her antics become so disastrous, that it is actually difficult to take it all in. Just somewhere along the line, I needed her to have a break from all the havoc!So whereas this is not what it seems, and it tries to hard to be funny, it may be appealing to readers who like a relatively fast paced book. But it fell a little short for me."
2,"The Story's Not So Great, But The Writing's Good","For the first 3/4 of the book, the unrelated incidents don't seem like much of a plot... just one bad day after another for the main character. The last 1/4 is pretty funny & I even laughed out loud a couple times. However, when I told a friend about it, she accused me having bad taste & said I wouldn't know funny from stupid."
2,Disappointing,"As an avid cross dresser myself, I expected to find a book that would open a window into my world, with the occasional ""aha!"" moment and humourous insights into my sort of life. So I was a little disspaointed that the treatment was so shallow. Non-transvestites may enjoy the book, but I would not reccomend it to transvestites."
4,Laugh-out-loud hilarious!,"I found this book delightfully, quirkily hilarious. I can't think when I laughed so much while reading a novel. I think this would be a cool, quirky cult film. The humor is somewhat weird and sicko, but the heroine and the little boy are so endearing and the situations so ludicrous that the whole thing comes off as charming."
4,Good value,"It's a cheap tire, but it's a great value for the money. It's the right size, mine was free from defects. A little tough to get on my rim, but could be my rim. If you want to get a tire on the cheap, I recommend this one."
4,Good buy,"These tires are for the second set of wheels of my mountain bike, the ""pavement"" set. The description of the product was correct, without unpleasant surprises. The tires were received earlier than expected, the fit was perfect, and they handle very well. So far, a good buy!"
5,Love these tires,"I live on a hill and like to ride my bike with my kids. I'm a big guy at 260 and I can tell you, these tires definately roll faster and easier than a stock MB tire. I inflate to 50 psi. So much easier going uphill and faster going down. Going up a hill is still going up a hill, it's work. But these make it easier if you have no intentions of going off road. I feel confident in turns. Beware of sand or other loose stuff or you will be eating rocks. Haven't had any flats in the 5 or so months I've had the tires and I ride on a rocky path sometimes. Awesome for the price."
5,fiery...passionate...breathtaking,"""Campise plays the saxophone like a devil with angel wings...fiery...passionnate...breathtaking..."
5,TombRaider Anniversary,I own tombraider anniversary for pc.And enjoy it very much. so I bought play station 2 for some one else-they like it very much. It is very good game.Thank you!
4,Tomb Raider RULES,"This game is WONDERFUL!!! I love that there are no complicated controls and the graphics... WOW! The puzzles get quite confusing at times, but it is VERY rewardin once you actually figure them out."
5,Tomb Raider Anniversary,Tomb Raider Anniversary is a must have you cannot go wrong with this purchase. If you are not a fan of Tomb Raider this video game is the best of the series. Just be sure to get the stategy guide with this game. The graphics are a step up for sure. The details are highly defined. I highly recommend this game.
4,Fantastic,amazing game. i was speechless when i finished the first level. crystal dynamics made some nice improvements on this game. and i really like it. the battles are not too intense and not too lame.the puzzles are my favorite. these puzzles dont require you to do them fast. you have to figure out a chain of them in your head first then solve it. the satisfation is the best reward you can get.gameplay is ok. camera is not bad. i love the detailed graphics and the music. it is def longer than the last one which is nice.
4,tomb raider-fun,"this game is alota fun, the art of the set designs are cool and well done. the puzzles are interesting and fun with a little action every now and then. though not the original tomb raider and you can tell by some disappearing elements and the aura the old lara gave off, from the previous games-which were good in and for its time. its a pity the 6th game was faulted to ruin everything. instead of a reboot, surveys couldve gone out or the original game producers couldve been supervised or something. yes, i do miss the old tomb raider. but the reboot was for the best hopefully."
4,Great,One of the best modern adaptations of an original game that was already awesome and so innovative at the time.
2,Nightmare Tomb Raider,This Tomb Raider was sooo Difficult that i couldntenjoy it! You better have the Guide to this one Before you even start it. Laura doesnt exibit the cool moves as she did in older versions. I couldnt get her to do the cool side jump back flips like i use to. The horses were a pain because in past games you had to be Agressive with your attacks. But in this level You had to Act Cowardly and Run AWAY from the horses to beat them. The Lava pit with 4 platforms had retracting poles that were only a diversion. Just run Grapple n get it done. The Bat attacks on Every platform you reached Got Old Fast.The Lava Tunnel was a challenge just when you thought you had it made out a new Blast of Steam or a Sinking last stepping stone killed Laura. To be fair its been a few years since i played Tomb Raider games But Geez cut LAURA SOME SLACK. Give Laura some Resident Evil Weapons!
4,"Information is good, just wish there was more.","The information provided was great, I just wish there would have been more of it. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone that is learning to manage currents."
1,Music?,"You have to be joking!It was only because it had been opened that I did'nt send it back.I only gave it one star as this is as low as the system allows.This CD was passed on to a ""Friend"" as a Xmas gift. I have not heard from him since."
2,_Burning_ toast with pat of Margolin,"It is, perhaps, unfair to comment on a book after reading but one chapter of it. But after completing the first chapter, I found I could read no more. The dialogue rings so false that I was compelled to put down the book. If this is, indeed, ""sure to be his biggest best-seller yet"" [dust jacket, 1st ed.], then I don't plan to read Margolin's other books."
4,An Entertaining Legal Thriller,"This is not what you would call great literature but it is an entertaining read. I remember reading about a case very similar to this in the news a few years ago. I thought the characters were very well developed, especially Gary, the mentally challenged boy. Some of the attorneys in this book are cast in a very bad light, so the story might not appeal to lawyers. The romance was a little syrupy but still palatable. One of the key characters is set afire in his jail cell....thus the title, Burning Man"
2,Still Searching,"I am still searching for an author who can take over this genre. Phillip Margolin's ""Burning Man"" fell way short of expectation. The book was very trite and very predictable, with to many Grishamish charatcers. Margolin throws all the typical ingredents in the book stirs them up and you get the same results, just another blah lawyer novel.Since William Coughlin's death and John Grisham writing movie books, there is no writer in this genre to be the leader. Margolin is worth another read, but if your looking for something inspired and different this is not the book to be reading."
3,The better of the two Margolin books I've chosen.,"I preferred The Burning Man to the last Margolin I had read: After Dark. Though not captivating, something about After Dark made me want to try Margolin again, and I'm glad I did.After some initial doubt in my ability to see it through due to the heart-wrenching exploitation of Gary Harmon, the story really picked up speed. Peter Hale was both endearing and reprehensible. I was pleased with the content, context, and pace. Margolin switched scenarios just often enough to keep the story fresh without losing track of the chronology of events. While the outcome was somewhat prematurely evident, the story was intriguing enough to see through to the end.Though not the greatest or most sophisticated of legal thrillers, The Burning Man was certainly a worthwhile investment of time."
3,Not his best,"Was disappointed with this book, was predictable and didn't care about the characters. Phillip Margolin is one of my very favorite authors and have always loved his books. This one was like he didn't write it."
3,Sleeping aid,"If your interest in this book is due to its low cost, I would advise you to re-consider. Presentation matters: a book published in 200x isn't just going to be prettier, but will have more helpful layout, notation, examples, illustrations, code in something other than Basic or Fortran. I am not easily scared by technical literature, yet look at the title I chose for my review."
4,Peter Mayer's pre-Buffett LP,"Pretty fair album - more commercial-sounding than some of Peter Mayer's later albums, but obviously pretty well put together. Sounds a whole lot sonically like Jimmy Buffett's ""Off to See the Lizard"" album. This is no surprise, since it's the same rhythm section and producer, just a few months shy of Elliot Scheiner's suggestion that Jimmy use PM as his band for the album. The lyrics aren't quite as interesting as later Mayer efforts, but the music sounds good, for the most part. Sheryl Crow makes a couple of pre-famous appearances on backing vox. Note: the CD has two extra tracks - ""Grown Men"" and ""I Live in a Hole"" - that weren't on the LP and aren't listed here. The best songs are on the LP, IMHO, but it's not exactly cheap or easy to come by, either."
3,"Started slow, got better; dated","The title of the review about sums everything up. It started off very slow and boring and I almost put it down. I was sick, however, and struggled on. The book gets a lot better in later chapters, but since it references the beginning a lot, you have to struggle through the beginning. There's some really good quotes in the last chapter. The use of traditionally offensive issues like online kiddie porn and violent ""erotica"" to illustrate the issues (in the beginning) was a decent attempt to shock the reader into re-examining digital law from other perspectives, but may backfire or upset some.As others have noted, though, it is quite dated."
4,A tremendous value for students of Internet law,"Overview: Give credit to authors Wallace and Mangan: they wear their sympathy on their sleeves. ""Sex, Laws, and Cyberspace"" is not intended to be an objective review of the state of First Amendment protection on the Net; it is a passionate argument for redefining how we apply the First Amendment to the Internet. This passion is both the book's strength and its weakness, as it will reinforce beliefs but not necessarily win converts. The book's outstanding summary of major events in Internet law will provide researchers with tremendous details in the years to come.Full text of this review is at: http://www.redstreet.com/readingroom/reviews/sexlaws.htm"
5,New age Internet safe for our children?,I believe that the book enstilled frightening thoughts in my mind of the dangers available on the Internet. A must read book before you let your child use the information superhighway.
4,"Great character development, but light on action","This is the first book I have read by Mr. Woodman and, for the most part, I was impressed. This book is very serious and ambitious for a sea novel. Some serious philosophical ideas are presented, as Drinkwater tries to resolve these issues in his mind. I particularly liked how Mr. Woodman informs the reader on the military, political and economic situation in England and America during the War of 1812. The plot of the novel moves along fairly quickly, however, with only brief time-outs for the serious ideas and the history lesson. The quality of Mr. Woodman's writing is very high, unlike some other writers I have read in this genre. I have only one complaint, and that is the lack of action. There are not many battle scenes in this book and they are not described in very much detail. Also, as an American, it is impossible to root for the English in this war. Still, on the whole I was impressed and I hope the rest of this series will be reprinted."
1,sample has error,"i like the concept by rational press, comprehensive and affordable. but this book is plague by error in samples. the book starts out good but gone down hill. check out the problem samples in chapter 8 & 9.i think computer book providing code that doesn't work should include errata for readers. what does the ""accuracy assured"" logo on the lower right corner of the cover mean?"
2,Very disappointing,"I had high hope for this book because it was reasonably priced and I wanted to familiarize myself with SSIS. It turns out that this is more a book for folks who already know some things about SSIS. It still would have been useful to me except for the fact that most of the example code does not work. I even downloaded it from the publisher and it still doesn't work. Maybe the finished product is different from when the book was published but I couldn'd find any email address for the author and no way to report this problem.I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for."
4,Who's Who?,"I really enjoyed this book because a teacher could incorporatea lesson on family trees with it. It has nice illustration, albeitsimple ones. Good for use in a primary classroom."
1,Fans - tel caller ID,It did not work.but i will keep it for a paper weight.Or i could use it for target practice.Thank You !
1,Defective unit recieved,"The unit was defective out of the box. One battery terminal was mounted wrong so that there was no circuit when the batteries were installed. I sent it back for refund and Amazon notified me of the refund. Amazon was great, it was a manufacturing error."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"A lesson (thankfully not an expensive one) in getting what you pay for. This caller i.d. is compact and runs on batteries, which are the two good things I can say for it. However, the date and time display are almost always wildly incorrect, even after you receive an inbound call (generally, the inbound call will carry with it the date and time stamp from the telephone company). Even after the minimum 2 to 3 rings required for the inbound number to appear, it sometimes appears and sometimes you just get the message ""ERROR."" (Thanks a heap.)"
2,not happy,I'm not happy with this caller i.d. It was 'stuck' in Spanish language when I received it and could not change it to English (I believe it had been previously returned). I did not return it as I was heading out of the country for three weeks and wanted a list of callers upon my return. It is not an accurate record compared to my original caller i.d. instrument.
3,Little Caller ID,"The box and print are both smaller that I thought they were from the pictures. The print is probably too small for weak eyes to read. Nevertheless, the unit works as advertised."
4,My Take,"This is about as simple of a caller ID that you can get, usually simple is good, in this case I personally did not like it at all. Fristly the call that shows up on the caller id does not stop showing, the name and # just stay...that is not normal for caller id's. Also its light weight so its easy for it to fall, and in general its junky, I really was being nice to give it a 4 star, my feeling is that for less you can get much much better, and I am referring to the Bellsouth Caller ID with Call Waiting CI 43. (much better product). Happy shopping."
4,"Does a good job, but digits are faintly visible","Does a good job, but digits are faintly visible. Try viewing different angles and/or a set of newly recharged batteries and that should fix it for you"
5,Works great!,"It is just a little different form my old one. I am very much a creature of habit, so it will take a little time to get use too.It works as stated and the face characters are big enough to see without glasses. I am pleased."
1,Caller ID box,The display is so dim you can hardly read it. It is not worth the money. I would not buy this product again.
1,Stopped working in less than a month,"I wanted a nice, simple caller id box for my elderly mother. This seemed to fit the bill. However it stopped working in less than a month. Instead of the incoming number the screen shows 88888888888888 and can't be cleared."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this using my iPhone app and didn't see the reviews. Lesson learned. This item is a complete piece of junk.First the screen wouldn't display any info, then when I finally got the screen working it completely failed within 2 days.Don't waste your money on this worthless item."
1,POS from China,"UPS delivered to home - that was the only positive experience. Installed 3 AAAs. Piece crap doesn't work. What do you expect for a product made in China. They can make these things so cheaply there's no need for product inspection/testing. so what if they a few hundred defective products, they still turn a profit."
1,Defective,The caller ID box I received was defective. I'm not sure if the defective ones keep getting returned and resold but the product I received did not work with the batteries I had. So I thought the batteries might be bad although they worked in other products. The new batteries I bought were installed correctly as the direction marked but the screen was still blank. I even tried calling my number to see if that would turn the screen on but nothing happened. So I am returning the product to Amazon and hope they don't try to sell it to anyone else.
5,Excellent for tile backer,"I'm a ceramic and marble installer and everything i do is over Cement board. I finally broke down 3 years ago and got with the program and picked up one of these guns. A roofer friend pointed me in the right direction. Initially i wasn't impressed, it left the nails slightly proud and required some extra hammering. From my experience these guns have a definite ""break in"" period. A few months after my purchase this tool started to perform flawlessly and still does.I don't use this as much as a roofer would, but to date i have had maybe 2 jammed nails and zero repairs!!great tool. period."
1,Environmental denial for kids,"Follows in the footsteps of Dixy Lee Ray and Gregg Easterbrook and others in denying the seriousness of environmental problems, this time sugar coated for parents and kids"
1,who are the supposed experts?,"From The Nation: Facts, Not Fear leaves out that many of its experts have ties to right-wing corporations and corporate polluters. Fred Seitz and Sallie Baliunas, for example, who review the chapter on ozone, have worked with the George C. Marshall Institute, which is funded by conservative foundations like Bradley and Scaife. M.B. Hocking, another of the experts, formerly worked for Dow Chemical. Donald Stedman has written for Heritage and worked for Ford Motor Company. The book, published by Regnery, also has ties to the religious right. The copyright belongs to the Alabama Family Alliance, part of the Focus on the Family network."
1,Undertand thine Enemy,"This book is only good for those interested at how anti-environmentalists like to market their ""ideas."" Unfortunately, it completely miscasts scientific data and debate, and shapes it to suit their needs. I was suspicious when I saw that Dan Quayle's wife wrote the foreword to the book. My suspicions were confirmed after reading it. This book is only useful for one thing: picking apart with reasoned science.There are 15 factual errors on the first 2 pages of the book! How do they defend this? They don't. This is the kind of mindless, trival, volume that is of no use and of no consequence. Look elsewhere to educate your children. Not all environmental and ecology education books are about ""gloom 'n' doom"" as the authors of this volume put it. But hiding things from your children will only hurt/disable them for the future, when they encounter serious environmental degradation and changes, and are not equipped to understand what they are seeing."
1,Looking for right wing propaganda to placate children?,"This summary is quoted from a ZPG memo:""The current flagship of the crusade against population and environmental education is the ironically titled book ""Facts not Fear: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Children About the Environment"" by Michael Sanera and Jane J. Shaw. The book, with a foreward by Marilyn Quayle, is filled with half-truths, distortions and outright lies about population and environment. ... This work pretends to be academic, but it is in fact only very slickly done anti-environmental propaganda which right-wing talk show hosts quote with delight.""Here's a quote from the book:""Will recycling save trees? Unfortunately, no. Much of our paper comes from trees that are planted specifically to grow pulpwood for paper. If the demand for paper declines, some owners will stop growing those trees.""Umm, alrighty then. It's providing an economics education too! Rush Limbaugh fans will eat this book for breakfast."
1,Not a guide to teaching children about the environment!,This book is a weak attempt to disclaim the positive advances made in the past quarter century in educating people about the environment. I hope that anyone reading this book looks at it with a critical eye. I do not recomend this book to anyone.
1,Embarrassing,"""Don't worry be happy"" might suffice as an attitude to get you through the day, but it is hardly a smart ideology with which to think about our environmental concerns. This book is trash. It is part of the right wing propaganda machine that denies fundamental, well-established environmental science. It was an embarrassment when published; more recent science--climate science in particular--demonstrates just how crazily wrong headed it is. Don't believe a word of it, and read real science to inform yourself about environmental matters."
4,great book,I thought this was a very good book. It had a great message to readers and an excellent description of characters. It shows images of what Earth could be in the future if we're not careful: a world of violence and a world without books or stories. It makes you really think. It's a nice book to read and have a discussion in a book club or English class. The plot was confusing in some parts but this is still a great book for free time reading.
4,Post--Apocalyptic Fiction,"This is the first book I read by Rodman Philbrick. And I must say I was pleasantly surprised!It takes place in the wake of what the main character, Spaz calls the ""Great Shake"".Apparently a gargantuan earthquake has left the world in ruins and a new world order has emerged. Some live out in the ruins... (The have nots) and some live in a paradise like utopiah, eden... (The haves).Our main character, Spaz is the lowest of the low. One totally shunned because of his disability, apparently he has epilepsy.He comes of age trying to find a way to get to his ailing sister.This story is enjoyable and interesting. I recommend it to fans of futuristic fantasy."
2,Hope you never have to read this,"This was assigned by my kid's English teacher and you had to want to read this thing. It had some futuristic stuff to keep a certain sci-fi spark going, but the vocabulary you had to learn to follow the plot was tedious. If you have a middle schooler who really devours books, this would be OK. But if you are looking for easy digestion - look elsewhere."
3,This book was boring,"When I saw this book, I had just got done reading Farenhiet 451, so I had some interest because the previous book had to do with books being burnt, and destroyed, so I wanted to see what this was about. It was not very interesting really, and it took me only three hours to read it. After I finished it, I was very dissapointed. The book is about a boy, who lives by himself in a broken down little hovel of a home. The world is divided into gangs, and he claims not to be in any of them. He knows about them, but hey, hes knows that gangs lead to trouble, and that's something he doesn't want. He lives in constant fear. The book did a nice job on displaying that the world was in ruins, and that's about it. The pace is fast enough to keep a fifth grader entertained, and I was surprised by the simplicity of this book. I advise that if you have this book in your drawer somewere, take it out, and make it the last time you ever had it in the world."
4,A Good Read,"This was a book about a future, it is very good. It tells of family, friendship, fighting, courage, and so much more. It is a good fast read and you will probably be able to finish it in a few days, if not one night."
1,Review of editorial review,"The title of this book piqued my interest. The first editorial review piqued it further. The second editorial review (above, Susan L. Rogers, from Chestnut Hill Academy, PA) needlessly spoiled the ending and several major plot points. Please do not publish spoilers in the main section of the main page for a book. If you must, please give some sort of warning.Thanks."
1,Not Read Of The Year,The book starts off slow and tapers off from there. The plot I think isn't a very exciting place to have a story take place. It is kind of depressing reading about a story that all they talk about is death and how the conditions they live in are so poor. I know that by having the story take place there it gives the story more variables but is depressing. I also really don't find it very interesting when the whole story is about these four people trying to get to a place and every chapter some group of things comes out of the middle of no where. There are so many different kinds of gangs and it is hard to tell who is good and who is bad and who has more power. I like book like that but this did not float my boat. The end of the book it probably the worst ending to any book that I have read. I could think of a couple ways that I could have wrote the end and it would have been better. I think this is the not read book of the year. But that is only my opinion.
3,"Read it, liked it","If you are looking for a high action Si-fi story, ""The Last Book in the Universe,"" is what you are loooking for. When Spaz hears about his sister slowly dieing, he embarks on a dangerous quest across latchs to find her. He is delayed by the ever dieing latchs and the crazed humans who live there. He travels to the paradise city of Eden, which turns out to be everything he dreams of. This paradise quickly turns into devastations as Spaz is sent back to the latch he has come from, to later find out that bad things can happen to good people."
1,Pretty Awesome (Ya right),Well I personally thought this was a horrible book If your reading Mrs Cutting cover your ears or close your eyes whatever. Anyway I really only like a book that has alot of action or grabs my attention and keeps me reading the book The last book in the universe did not. It was some what interesting but lost me towards the end. I reccomend not to read don't waste your time pick up a Anthony Horowitz Book instead.
4,"One On One With ""The Last Book In The Universe""","""The Last Book In The Universe"" is a fantastic and adventurous book. Rodman Philbrick does a great job of getting the reader to know the characters.It all starts with a boy named Spaz that lives in a latch with a gang called the Bangers. Rodman Philbrick never says what year it is and that gives it even more mystery. On a routine stop Spaz finds a poor old man. Little did Spaz know, the old man ( Ryter ) will become a major role in his life. Spaz and Ryter set off on a quest with the help of Layana and Chox, to find Spaz's sister. before she dies. When they arrive to Spaz's old family unite they have to cure her of her disease called Leukemia, but their times they have lost the sure for it. So they only have one option. Go into Eden where normals are canceled right away.I believe this is one of the best books I've read. It's full of hope, adventure, and even mystery. I would recommend this book to young teen age readers."
4,Eden and the Urb,"I gave this book four stars. I would have given it five stars, but the ending was very sad. The main characters are Spaz, an epileptic boy; Ryter, an old writer; and Lanaya, a very beautiful person from Eden, a place where everything is perfect. Spaz and Ryter go on a journey to see Spaz's sister Bean who is very sick. On their way through all the latches, places ruled by gangs, they meet Lanaya who takes them to Bean. Then, she takes everyone to Eden to cure Bean. This book's setting is similar to what a lot of people think the world is going to turn into in the future: a horrible, polluted place. This book is pretty easy read. Most eleven-year-olds could read it. Only some of the words are hard. I would recommend this book to all ages. When I was reading this book, I didn't want to put it down because it always left me wanting to know what was going to happen next. This book is one of my favorite books."
1,do not recommend,"This book was ordered on July 5, and as of July 30 it was not received and there was no response to two requests regarding the status of the order."
4,Great Comic Meets Shoddy Printer,"Now I love GPF, been reading it daily and religiously for a while now online. What's not to love about GPF? Funny plots, great stories, awsome characters, 007's, slime molds, and all that jazz. However I was severely disappointed when I got my copy of this book. I wasn't even half way through reading the book when as I'm turning the pages, I hear some snaps, and by the time I was done reading the book, the cover had completely fallen off. And no, it's not a one time deal, it happened with the other book as well.So while I do recommend this book to be bought, just make sure you a gluegun or superglue in hand when you read it."
1,Spend your money on other tools,"It jams a lot, waste time clearing it out. The tip don't last long, no carries tip any more plus not cheap. The screws are not cheap. they even made a kit to convert the thing to a drywall gun for the price of a cheap d-w gun @ H.D."
2,I take it back!,"My initial review of 2 stars is way off-base. After several listens this album grows on you, and is really top-notch. Elite Force is one of a dying breed of quality breaks producers. Pick this up now!"
2,Completely inaccurate about the current downturn,"The book provides some insight into forgotten economic events, but I'll bet the author didn't believe Lehman would fail, nor the ""panic"" that since has transpired in America."
2,"Upbeat, but soul-less","So much jazz of the 1980s and 90s is heavily produced studio music that offers little challenge to the listener and few surprises. The tracks are laid down one at a time by musicians who may never see one another, much less interact and feed off of each other's energy. It would be easy to dismiss this album as another of the bunch, but in fact, it has its moments. There are some nice surprises, and solos by Whalum, Zonjic, and James himself are fresh and spirited. Overall however, the sound does not wear well, and the percussive backbeat goes from mind -deadening to downright annoying afer a few cuts. This isn't one you're likely to want to play more than a few times."
4,got what I wanted,"I was looking to replace an old pair of Koss(yard sale purchase years ago)with more comfort and maybe better sound.After reading 10 or more reviews I chose the Sony. Very comfortable.No clicks,hum,or buzz.The sound is good and picks up things on the cd's I had not heard on my speakers.I am glad I did not pay listed retail($99.99).I think these are a value at the Amazon price.I received excellent service through J&R electronics.I did not go 5 stars because I had no other brands of equal quality or price to listen to and compare."
1,"Two strikes, you're out!","Unit arrived with a bad plug/jack on the headphone. It would play left or right channel, but not both at the same time. Returned for replacement. Replacement unit had the exact same problem. Sent it back for full credit. I'll try another model next.Not sure if it is a coincidence or an enginering/manufacturing problem at Sony."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,My children and I love all the Alexander Stories. The item shipped in great time and was exactly what I expected!
1,you get what you pay,"ive had the model for 2 yrs and ive regretted everyday ive had it, ive never been impressed with this tv, my old rca 65"" had a better pic even when watching hd on this model, ive used the rgb with hd, it was ok but not impressive, you cant use the pip with hd.and you cant adjust 480!/1080i in menu , the menu can change on you. best thing i can say about this model is its easy to use. i should have thought twice before i bought this i found it at sams for $1000. after 2 yrs the blues are green and a woman with red lipstick looks orange, when put this tv side by side with my daughters laptop and boy did it make the hdtv look real bad, the puter had a crisper picture, ours looked old and faded."
1,Poor service and warranty,I bought this tv for sports and movies. It is not our primary tv and as such doesn't get much use. The week of the Masters I'm all set to watch golf in hi def but the screen goes black. When I call Phillips they say it should be covered under warranty. The service tech comes out and determines the tv has a voltage problem. That's when Phillips says tough luck you are out of warranty. The repair estimate is $475.I will not buy a Phillips product again simply because of the service issue.
4,The Bakke Case : Quotas in College Admissions,"I'm using this book for a term paper in school. It gives a lot of information on Affirmative Action and ties in the Bakke Case. Not only did it begin with the Civil Rights Period, but it went back very far historically to the beginning of Slavery. It is written in a very chronilogial order, which is very helpful for notes and understanding the judicial process behind this case.The information on Bakke and the other people involved in very good. Arguments are made both for and against Affirmative Action. There is no bias. It is written very clearly and it is really not possilbe to get caught up in all the legal terms. I would recommend this book to anyone studying or interested in Affirmative Action and/or the Bakke Case, although it may be a little young for some."
5,Can't beat this one !,"I own several Hitachi nail guns. I purchased this model about a year ago. I've used it in my cabinet shop to build out numerous jobs. It has never jammed! It's powerful and light weight. I had previously purchased a porter cable but it only fired up to 1 1/4 "". I don't even touch that one anymore. you will never regret buying this one."
2,Not that good,"We recently purchased this gun to replace a PC that we had been having problems with.(wore out) The first box and a half it worked great. Now it wants to double run brads and sometimes will not countersink a 2"" brad flat into a 3/4"" piece of oak.Also, the release for the magazine is kind of cheap too. I am going to buy a gun for my own personal use, but it won't be this one."
2,security bed rail.,It was not what I thought it was when i ordered it. Had to strap it down to keep it in place. Also seems like a safety hazzard for the elderly to get their arms stuck in.
2,Fluffy,"I am a high school Lating student who until recently had problems getting it together. I picked up the complete idiot's guide, hoping it would improve my understanding of this amazingly comples language.To put it mildly, it didn't. This guide is extremely fluffy, filled with useless facts about Roman civilization that do nothing for actual comprehension. For anyone looking to REALLY learn Latin by themselves this may be a good starting point. But if you are a student of the language for over like three months, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.The fact is, you are better off with the newest edition of Wheelocks. Latin is a language that requires hard work to learn, there are no short cuts. This guide only exemplifies that point.[I gave it 2 stars because if you are JUST starting Latin this book puts everything in extremely simple English, which helps.]"
3,An Idiot's Guide to the Studying of Latin,"Personally, I felt the book could have been presented in a more simple format! It falls short of the ""Dummies"" series of books. Perhaps, I was expecting more. The exercises are somewhat tedious. Nonetheless, I am glad to have the book for my review of the Latin grammar. George L. Balentine"
4,Latin Light....,"If you are looking for a magic alternative to learning your declensions and conjugations, then forget it- there is still no substitute for drill, drill, drill. As for syntax and inflection, well, that is the result of osmosis from years of reading well composed Latin. However, if you haven't cracked a text in several decades and are looking for a light review, this book is a pleasant and light memory jogger. Just don't expect to be able to translate the Enneads, or even Caesar's Commentaries afterwards.Perhaps a better title would have been pidgin Latin, or Latin for barbarians...."
3,Could Have Done Better...,"As an introductory text, it is rather unkind to the beginner. It begins and ends with a list of words, with little, incoherent explanations, and offers few (if any) examples that put these words into a context. However, there is some substance to the book, but I think that more grammar could be put with the vocabulary."
2,HAH!,"i am a high school student currently taking latin courses! this book did NOTHING for me, it is musch much musch easier than what is taught inside the classroom! if you want to learn latin go take a class because this is not the same as any toher language! thee are difffernt declensions and endings and there are differnt versions such as past present and future and perfect and all sorts of things.... this book will do nothing and it is a sham e to the language"
3,Could be better,"I was disappointed. I understand the lack of compelling need to pronounce a language that hasn't been spoken as a native language for centuries and that's fine. And I thought the tidbits on Roman culture were interesting, if not always relevant.I agree with other reviewers about ""huge blocks of words are presented at a time."" This book not only requires a lot of memorization in very large chunks, but the book is not well-organized. (For example, Practice #2 uses plural words in the exercise, yet those words aren't introduced until the following page.)I also found some of the labels for word classes (for a Complete Idiots book yet) were either explained in a confusing way or not explained at all - such as ""declension"" or ""genitive case."" If it's a ""Complete Idiot's Guide,"" than there must be a better way of explaining these terms.""Latin for Dummies"" was better by comparison but not by a significant amount."
2,Miranda simply doesn't impress me much.,"I'm usually a huge Bertrice Small fan, but I think that she started to lose her punch with this book. Miranda is a flat, dispassionate character and I couldn't identify with her in any way, nor could I identify with Amanda, Jared, any of them. The Russian setting could have been used SO much more eloquently than it was, the slave farm scenes were frankly ludicrous, and a lot more ""fight and spice"" should have been used to get the two main characters back together again - a simple ""tell me your story"" just doesn't work in real life, much less fiction! This was probably one of my least favorites....sigh."
1,Same story over and over...,"I'm TIRED of the same plot in Mrs. Smalls novels. What is with the women being abducted into harems and reunited with their true loves? Lets see..It happened in Skye Omalley, A Love of All Time, Lost love found, This heart of mine, Bedazzled, The Kadin, Love Wild and Fair, The Love Slave, To Love Again...ECT.... GET A NEW PLOT LINE!!!!!!!! Enough of the HAREMS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not her best but still an ok read...,"Sexy, daring, yes this book has lots of that!Miranda wasn't very likable but the hero, Jared was. She has lots of adventures and lots of sex with other men in order to save the hero (what a good sport she is!) and they live happily ever after. The end.Sounds trite? For a 400+ page book it sure is! The history drags here and there and the 'love at first sight' bit is overblown.The love/lust scenes are sizzling which redeems this otherwise forgettable book."
1,Watch out - The Magnets can break,We got this for my son yesterday. He is a train fanatic. He loves it! Unforunately it is going BACK to the store! One of the magnets broke on one of the train and they are fairly small. We found it before his younger brother got to it thankfully. I have heard too many stories about children becoming injured or permanent damage due to swallowing magnets. Be careful if you purchase this toy.
4,"A fascinating compelling glimpse, into, our evolutionary past which was successfully weaved together through fossil evidence","It can not be argued that human origins is a, compelling fascinating glimpse into our evolutionary past that for generations to,come has caused controversy in it,s debate amongst religious churches, for being too judgemental in the way we looked once which,of course is, a huge part of our, eveyday lives in categorizing whom we came from in the culutre, that we live in which is a pretty general idea on what it's based upon which is human evolution the slow gradual step-by-step change from ape to man something that in our philosophical existence we can't accept as created myth."
2,Tough to read.,"I had just finished reading ""The Real Eve,"" ""The Seven Daughters of Eve,"" ""The Journey of Man,"" and ""Anglo-Saxons, Picts and Celts,"" and then tried to plunge into this one. May be a good book, but very hard to read as it is too scientific for me to enjoy easily.Sandra Casey"

3,Not What I Was Hoping for,"This DVD is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for more tips, common mistakes to watch out for, and simple exercises that I could do at home to help me with my turns. Instead, it's basically a pirouette class with a minimal focus on tips and exercises. This isn't to say that there isn't a lot of instruction, there is, but it's basically just describing the steps. So if you're not familiar with the steps, the DVD would be instructive. But because there's so much talking, and the combinations take up so much floor space, it's not even serviceable at home as a substitute for a pirouette class. So I've watched it once, and will probably watch it again to see if I can catch anything I might have missed the first time, and then it will no doubt start collecting dust on my shelves."
3,This is not exactly my type of ballet class,"Too much explanations before execution of barre and center works. It could be great for some viewers. Given I am taking Ballet as alternative workout and after work leisure for stress relief, I reckon Dmitri Roudnev's DVD series are much better for my own enjoyment."
3,"Madacy, you could do better","Bob Marley has become the symbol of reggae. He has a unique, powerful voice that just brightens any room. This budget priced set, 20 Best of Bob Marley, isn't what you think it is.First of all, the appropriate title would be '20 Best of The Wailers,' considering Peter Tosh sings on several of these songs. I LOVE Peter Tosh, but why is his music on a Bob Marley collection?And, the sound quality is not great. It's not as bad as some of these Madacy releases, but they could do a lot better.And, my last issue is that 'Trenchtown Rock' is edited.My advice is for somebody wanting to sample Bob's early years, ignore this one and pick up '20th Century Masters.' The sound quality is superb. Although that one has 10 as opposed to the 20 offered here, it is still a much better buy. Despite the fact that is priced cheap, DON'T BE FOOLED!!!"
5,Best 20-inch TV on the market today!!,"This is an excellent TV, loaded with features usually found on larger ... models. The FST PURE flat screen delivers a remarkably sharp picture, and the sound is rich and full with the BBE sound enchancement feature. The universal remote is good, and the menus are for the most part well thought out.There are enough jacks for all home theatre gear, with 3 A/V inputs (2 rear, 1 front), A/V output, component video input, S-video input, and as a added bonus, a headphone jack!This TV outperforms the comparable Sony model by virtue of it's sound and A/V jacks selection.I highly recommend this television as a second TV, but it is good enough to be your main TV."
4,Nice TV - but....,Looking at this TV side by side with The Sony - the Sony picture quality looked better in the store. It could have been the way the TV's were setup via the menu options. I picked this model because it came with more features and it was cheaper. There is a low level hum coming out of the back of this unit that sounds like flourescent lights but I can't hear this when the sound is on. The remote control lags i.e. changing channels / video input / menu options. I programmed my universal remote and this problem went away. The picture quality is very good but there are some nuisances with this TV.
1,worst design ever,doesnt work worth anything and loses suction within a half hour. just spurts dirty water back into pond. bag comes off within seconds and spreads muck everywhere. plus adding lots of chlorinated water into pond. terrible design. don't waste the twenty odd bucks!
1,Nice Concept... Does not work... Pass on it,"After reading the other reviews I thought I would order this to see if it would work on my pond. Quick answer no it did not. Great concept. It uses a reverse flow to direct the water backward away from nozzel and hence creates suction. I thought I would be able to fill the pond and clean at the same time. Problem is that the collect net is directly in the water flows path. As the muck gets vacuumed up into the net it (the muck) gets caught in the net. However, one the net is all filled up with muck the pressure increases on the net and it breaks away from the vacuum. This would be okay if there was a lot of muck but its only enough to barely cover the screen/net. I tried for two days to get it to work. Used lots of patience but no luck. I wish it did work but now have to find another muck solution."
1,not a good product,"It's made of very cheap plastic, joints were glued together crooked, bag comes off during use, and after little use the seams of bag started to fray. The bag was also too small and the mesh did nothing to screen out fine particles. Definitely NOT worth $20."
4,Love this product- altho not perfect!,"Have a 2500 gallon pond- want a vac but not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on one. This little vac is not perfect- but it does a great job!! it definitely picks up rocks and debris on the bottom very well- although the finer dirt does go through the bag and back in the water. i tried putting some quilt batting in there- which really helped and got a lot of fine dirt out. Again, as stated before, the construction is rather flimsy- especially the plastic handle- but if you are careful- it should last. I am very pleased with the vac- as it is def. worth the money to get a lot of the bigger muck out of the pond. Easy to work, easy to clean- Glad I bought it!!!!"
2,Pond vac,This vac is ok for light duty only. I have a small pond and wanted a small vac to clean up the occasional leaves or light debris which windy weather can bring.. The bag has a tendency to fall off when filed more than 30%. The pole cannot withstand weight either. The brush attachment does work well to scrub sides of dirt/light build up. Would invest in heavy duty model vacuum if your pond is of any significant size. This vac is serviceable for small ponds and fountains.
3,This is not 5-pin mini connector,"Reminder/Caution: Most USB devices that use Mini-B USB connectors use the 5-pin variety, not the 4-pin type of this cable. I believe that the connectors are also physically different to prevent inadvertent use of the wrong one. Amazon sells both types. I gave it 3-stars because Amazon does not have an option to review without rating. I have nothing bad or good to say about this product. I simply wish to alert users of the 4-pin, 5-pin distinction."
5,Brain candy,"This is a fun book on logic, pardoxes and puzzles. It's a good mental tune-up and reminder of the limits of what we think we know. Poundstone is an entertaining writer who knows how to take us through the logical steps without making feel like work."
5,Enchanting,"For a Strauss and soprano lover this disc is enchanting. Warm,mellow,intense,floating, I love it. Fleming is a consummate artist and the choices of Graham and Bonney I find most fortunate as supplements.The orchestra soars in splendor. I liked the inclusion of the conversation in Arabella before the aria"
1,Strauss for lovers of Celine Dion,"I don't know how people can appreciate that singer. Dull voice, no expression, bad accent in German... That disc is like all the others of Fleming (including the forthcoming Alcina)."
5,in with the new,"I am thankful to Renee Fleming and few other newer opera stars, such as Villazon, Gheorgieu,Alagana, Netrebko. Because of them and thru them this art form will continue. It baffles me some of the critics that just can't let go of the old timers, the dinosaures of opera. Tho I love them too, that is where i began my young journey. Wake up, at least it will live on. This cd is marvelous. I had not heard any Strauss so because of Fleming I puchasedf it, and many others. The beauty and grace of her voice and the other sopranos is just down right divine. I encourage people to open their minds and spirits. My next experience will be seeing her and Villazon in La Traviata. Wow cannot wait"
3,The music in the middle of CarTalk,"Ever listen to CarTalk and hear that haunting piano-and-guitar number in the middle? Well, it's from the Dixie Flyer track on Land of Dreams. Hard to tell from the clip here, but trust me-- it's the same (listen and you'll hear the similarity.) I haven't heard the album, but if it's as good as the clip, it's a winner."
4,Cold-blooded,"Randy Newman is one of America's great popular songwriters, and with this disc he returns to familiar turf: growing up, child abuse, racism, rap music, the Almighty buck, love, and divorce. The CD covers the many moods of Mr. Newman so completely that you may ask yourself how it is that ""Falling in Love"" and ""I Want You to Hurt Like I Do"" can be the work of the same man. But the question answers itself, doesn't it: cynicism is the bastard child of innocence and faith. The latter cut is the break-up song to end all break-up songs, the one just about no one could bring themselves to sing along with; a funny song, like so much of Newman's best work, that does not permit you to laugh."
1,Missing USB adapter,I received the headphones without the USB adapter. Amazon makes it difficult and a big pain to return the headphones. I'm disappointed.
5,Sennheiser PC155 Traditional Binaural PC Headset,"Even though this headset was refurbished, its appearance was like new and performance is excellent.Great product."
4,great vocals,"Love these girls. Ran across the CD and just had to buy it. Great vocals, great chemistry, and they make my day. Thank you!!"
5,"Great toy, well made and needs NO batteries!","My kids really love this toy! We take turns trying to see who can get it to go the farthest. So far my son's record is 12 feet! The triceratops is well made, as is Raphael. And he doesn't fall off when he rides either. To me, the best part of the toy is the fact that it doesn't require batteries. I would highly recommend this toy, no noise, no batteries, well made, what more could you ask for?"
3,nailer,"I had to take this off my list because I need something that shoots three inch nails, plain and simple. Hitachi makes one, but its not on amazon. Up in wisconsin, we're sheathing and then adding 5/4 polystyrene, then tyvek, then 1/4 in of siding. It leaves a 2 1/2 in nail buried just shy of 3/4 of an inch into the framing. Working with the weight of cement siding, you'll want to have a bit more bite than that."
1,Guaranteed to JAM!!!!,This is the absolute worst siding nailer I have ever used! I have used other Hitachi nailers that work great but this gun sucks! It jams at least once per clip which is unacceptable! I highly recommend to stay away from this gun!!!!
5,NOT GREAT BUT BEST AVAILABLE,"being in the siding business for 35 years, i have tried them all, Starting with the 12 pound duofast guns from the early 1970's.....this hatachi product is light , easy to load, very fast nail advance with not too much jam up. all guns eventually wear out, some just sooner than others, if you use this gun every other day for 10 hours, you will probley get a good year or so from it, then......... throw it out, dont rebuild it, it will break again very soon, not worth the rebuild, i have a collection of many brands, i feel this one the BEST!"
3,"Good, not Great","This is a nice nailer, but as has been mentioned, Hitachi should include the sequential trigger kit as other manufacturers do for free. Or better yet, it should have a switch to change firing modes. Instead, you get ripped off for over $60 if you want the kit. The way it is, if not carefully held, be prepared for two or three nails to fire at once. Also, check your building code before you use this for nailing up sheathing. The nails this nailer fires may be too small to meet code. It is not a sheathing nailer.Another problem I encountered is that it is paticular about the brand of nails. Hitachi nails (electroplated) work fine, others may not work so well. I had problems with hot-dipped galvanized."
4,All about the speed.,Excellent for quick and speedy installation of siding. Nails Hardie siding like it was pine. Make sure you adjust for correct length of nails or you will constantly be cleaning misfired nails. Some nail brands shoot better than others. Overall nice and handy tool.
3,Was hoping for more,this show had a good history of The Amos and Andy show starting from the radio days. There were some out takes fromn a few TV shows but I wanted to see more of the TV shows I remember as a kid.
3,rreasonable substitute,Allowed me to view a typical episode without the need to purchase the entire series. Overview from George Kirby added insight. No need for other actor comments including original cast members.
4,Good product,"This is a good sturdy Hole Saw which, after some adjustments, has worked perfectly well. I would have rated it a bit higher but it took me a while to get the hang of using it as a couple of parts kept coming loose while I was drilling my first couple of holes...then I realized I was missing a screw that was supposed to hold things in place. It apparently wasn't in the package. By then I had limped my way through enough wood that I couldn't return it so I found a screw that fit the hole and voila, the rest of the work was a breeze.If you order, don't be like me and jump right into your work. Check it over carefully and make sure everything that is supposed to be there is there."
3,not the apply of my blue eyes,I just don't like the apple in it. It's otherwise a great product. 1/2 lb comes in a resealable container!
1,hated this,I only listened to a few parts of a few songs and hated this right away. I thought it sounded like a terrific idea. It's not for me.
1,Maintenance user,"This pelican model is by far the most versatile design I have ever used, unfortunatley we have had a 100% failure rate due to the poor internal wiring design. The unit works fine for awhile, then intermittently and finally giving up the ghost. This is not an acceptable product for aviation flight line use.Pelican does back up the product, but that doesn't really help solve the issues with the design, when you need light you need light."
5,Very versitale light,"I was looking for an inexpensive utility light and came across these clamp-on lights from Pelican. Pelican makes some neat products; reasonably priced. The light clamps to any appropriately sized surface (cap visors, shirt pockets, box lids, etc.)and serves as an area light by virtue of two bright LED's. I bought two to carry in my day-pack and the ditch bag for my UTV. They are very versatile and resemble a two LED pocket light that clamped to a 9 volt battery, which was offered for sale several years ago. I always wanted one of those, but find this Pelican light to be far superior. Other reviewers have complained of breakage; I have not experienced what others have reported but have found the hinge point for the LED head can be extremely stiff and tight. For the price, I recommend these these clamp-on LED lights as they have many uses in many activities. If Pelican decided to make these lights in a ruggedized version, I'd surely buy one."
1,Breakage again and again,JUNK is all I can say after the third one broke. Utterly undependable with a flawed design in the hinge and the connections. None of them lasted for more than a few times of use. I used to love this company.
3,well done outerspace,"first full length LP by these boys, im happy for em. Lots of good raw lyricism paired with featuring spots that weren't wasted. Personally of the solo Outerspace songs, It is What it Is is probably my favorite, along with fire and fire, its all fire in fact. It's also very good to see Immortal Technique dropping some cancerous ish on another's album, and he doesn't dis-appoint on Angels of Death, neither does Paz, featured on Blades of Glory. The beats were very well done, which i was slightly worried about upon hearing about the album (assuming Stoupe wasn't producing much to any songs). The lyrics are a tad repetitive but still entertaining and thats really what it comes down to. The amount of wisdom or knowledge kicked in this album is minimal, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Overall a decent album, and worth the 20 bucks to pick up if you like good underground ish, i enjoyed it."
4,Excellent first release,"Outerspace can rap, there is no question about this. Their first album is pure heat. It has some extremely hot lyrics combined with very dope beats. The guest appearances are all off the hook. I would recommend tracks 8, 12 and 14 to anyone who loves rap. Planet and Crypt spit straight fire on those tracks. They've evolved over the years and can rightfully be considered two of the dopest MC's in the underground. If there next album has some beats produced by Stoupe it will likely be worthy of five stars."
4,Hot....,"This album is nothing less than what you would expect from outerspace if you are familiar with them. The single that dropped is the Sadat X track, which was the first I heard. Outerspace outshines X on the mic and the beat is on point. All in all it is a solid babygrande release. (all the beats are sick) And to clear up some of the confusion... outerspace said in an interview they didn't want to bother Stoupe with making tracks for this albim because he was too busy makin the new Jedi Mind album Legacy of Blood. (which is due out in the end of September) One thing I am wonderin is whether Jus and Vinnie buried the hatchet cause Jus was on the Untitled track on the re-release of Violent by Design. Anyone know?.........Anyways, a solid buy."
4,"Earthy, Sensual & Exotic","When I bought Shaman I was looking for music that would facilitate meditations that were more like indigenous journeying experiences. Interestingly, although the music has that ability (if you are into that sort of thing), I also found it to offer an earthy hypnotic invitation to begin swaying your hips and moving your arms to create one's own sort of slow moving sensual-type tantric dance -- especially so if you are alone. If you find yourself with a significant other, the music's exotic sensuality invites...well, one thing to lead to another. On top of all that, I'm a massage therapist and this music is great to play when my clients want something a little different. Personally, I really enjoy this CD. The only drawback, if you want to call it that, is that it's not the kind of music you could listen to every day. I'm pleased I've come across it when I'm in the mood for earthy, sensual & exotic."
5,CD purchase,"The cd is awesome, as I expected. Once ordered the delivery from Amazon was very prompt, and I will defiantly order again."
2,"David, stick to what you do best.","David Arkenstone has a new band. This is pretty sleepy stuff for what I've come to expect from Arkenstone. This rates aboout an 8 on the Kitaro scale, or the equivalent of taking 2 Nytol over a glass of beer. Vision Quest reminds me a little of a Sarah McLaughlin tune."
1,Did not even finish the film,"Wow.....this was a BAD film. Everything about this film was so bad I didn't even make it past 20 min. before skipping to the middle and then end. It never got any better. Terrible acting, way, way too much on speeches from the characters on political injustice and non realistic street lingo. Sorry for a bad review. This is actually the first review I've ever written, but it was actually that bad of a movie. I rented it based on the previous and only review and now wonder if it was written by a friend of the film makers. Oh well."
4,They are acceptable,Received these in package with some larger ones for an art project. They are about the size of marbles. They arrived in good order.It looks like they were shipped from China!
3,The one that came was not clear. yellowish,"Was looking for a matching crystal since I already had one. Needed it for feng shiu purposes for my new home. When I finally received it, I found that the crystal was not clear. It was yellowish like plastic that had gotten discolored in the sun. It appears to be a glass crystal but the color is not as pictured on the items sale page. O well, it will have to do."
5,perfect size,"this is just the right size to hang in the window on a nice string of beads. it's not to small and not to large.it makes wonderful rainbows, lots of them.this is the real deal. definitely buy it if your interested!"
1,Defective and misrepresented,"These crystals arrived on the same day as 15 larger crystals from another Amazon retailer. After being amazed by the quality of the larger crystals, I excitedly opened the 20inch ones. What a LETDOWN! Every single ball had a strange yellow discoloration. Specifically: the glass did not have a uniform, yellow hue. If so, they would all at least be the same ugly yellow. Some were a cloudy, dark urine type yellow. Others were clear but with a splotchy green/yellow tint. This seller must not have any quality control. I'll report back on whether they will at least issue a refund."
3,Many Tiny Rainbows,"I only bought one crystal, and it wasn't what I expected, but it's a good product. I was planning on giving this crystal to my niece--she likes to look at the raibows created by our coffe table top. Later, I decided not to give it to her because of the lead content(I know it's probably not dangerous, but I hadn't thought about it before). Also, the raibows were not what I expected. I put the crystal on a string, and have to catch the sun just right, and I get a bunch of tiny tear-drop rainbows that spin--kind of like a disco ball :). It's cute, but I was hoping for bigger rainbows. The effect would be a lot better with more crystals or if we got more direct sunlight through our windows."
2,the very small luger book,I found this book to be an extremely small book with some photographs that were not clear. I returned my copy.
2,Over Priced Over Hyped,"I agree with some of the other reviewers who have stated that this ""booklet"" is overpriced and underwritten. It is very small in physical size, has poor quality pictutes, and has very limited written information. What is there is interesting, but there isn't much there. I cannot give the booklet a positive recommendation. There are many better books out there at much more reasonable prices. The price leads one to think it might be something special - IT IS NOT!"
4,Lugers of Ralph Shattuck by Russell C. Keep III,"A great little Coffee Table Top Book which gives an overview of Luger development and history. Fantastic pictures of the Luger. A must for collectors of Luger books, pistols and other Luger memorabilia"
3,Worth A Watch.,"Antonia's Line wasn't a bad film. To my knowledge, the only other Dutch film I've seen besides this would be Soldier of Orange with Rutger Hauer--that's also a pretty good movie. One thing I enjoy about European films like Antonia's Line would be the fact that they're not afraid to do things differently. This movie deals with a lady (along with her daughter) who comes back to her hometown after being away for some time. I won't say anything else about the plot besides that. The acting in this film is better-than-good. The cinematography is also quite nice. This movie is worth a watch."
5,Absolutely fabulous! Larger than life!,"I saw this movie on the big screen and went back to see it the next night. A rare thing for me. An extremely appealing movie that focuses on a single mother after the war, who takes on the ""lost"" of a village. Kind and big hearted, Antonia is a jewel. So is this movie !"
4,Greatly overlooked,"The story is very well told and I felt such a connection to the characters in this movie, I almost felt as if I lived their lives. You feel every emotion during this movie from warmth and love to wrath and hatred. The acting is superbly done. My husband even enjoyed this movie despite that it is a movie focused on the empowerment of women. I believe this movie is a diamond in the rough and greatly overlooked."
5,The best foreign film I have ever seen.,"This is a great movie. The relationships that are exploredreveal their depth between all the characters.You see a love betweeneveryone, mother to daughter, grandmother to grandaughter and last but not least, lover to lover.There are those out there that might be offended by the rape scene and the frontal nudity but mainstream foreign filmmakers are not afraid to hide the naked body from their audience.I decided not long ago that I had to own this movie so I went out and bought it. It will always remain a part of my movie collection. END"
4,Sophisticated Awkwardness,"While the movie is an amazing movie that I feel any film student should watch, I do believe that not most will and should be able to handle it. There's a rape scene and a few sex scenes.The movie is a great coming of age film in a later in life experience. If you're looking for a great German film with aspects you can relate to, watch this movie."
5,Absolute masterpiece,"Antonia's line is one of my all-time favourite films. I was very surprised when it won the Academy Award as it was far too risky to seduce the sometimes narrow-minded Academy members. As other people said this is a celebration of life and its circle showing some very interesting characters and clever attitudes about sex and religion. Some accused it to be too feministic, but in my opinion this is a film directed by a woman about four generations of women, and as a man, I never felt insulted. All it shows is pure respect and tolerance. An absolute gem to enjoy again and again. Don't be afraid of the subtitles, you are in front of one of the most beautifully deep films of recent times.Enjoy... Thanks for reading."
2,Male-bashing cartoon,"Two-dimensional unsympathetic characters, some very flat and unbelievable performances, unrepentant male-bashing, arbitrary and gratuitous use of special effects, predictable plot turns, no ending-- hence the story device of starting at the end and then going back to the beginning, and having to read English subtitles only adds to the viewer's misery. Don't waste your time and money. If you like foriegn films, see ""Nowhere in Africa"" instead."
2,See Amelie instead,"A fairly tired film with a predictable European sensibility (e.g., easy targets like male chauvinism and the clerical hypocrisy).The film is assembled with a kitchen-sink mentality; a character is raped, another discovers she's a lesbian, etc. All serve as plot devices to advance how progressive the protagonist is in dealing with these issues. Rent Amelie instead!"
2,Feminist Fantasy,European trash are not interesting enough for a two hour movie. The characters are all cliche's of village life. The bad guy is a blond (facist) rapist. He rapes his sister and a little girl. He comes back to town in a military uniform. The good people in this movie are all Lefty lesbians and tough grandmothers. This movie is a feminist fantasy of the European variety. The men are stupid and the women are brilliant. The only smart man in the film commits suicide.
1,This movie made me physically ill.,Please do not buy this movie. It is the most disgusting and perverted film I have ever seen. I will not write a summary because I will vommit if I have to think about it any more.
4,Not Quite Perfect,"Large buttons light-up and are easy to read at night. The ""master volume"" setting works the TV, DVD, and other untis --Except the VCR. I confirmed this in the owners manual. Have not called tech support to see if there is a work around. The play, reverse, and fast forward buttons are not logically placed. However, this unit appears to be the best easy to read, illuminated remote available today based on my internet searches."
3,Doesn't work with every TV,"I bought this for my Philips TV, bought in 2003. For some reason, the remote just doesn't work with this TV. It works perfectly with my Sony (much older than the Philips) and my Toshiba (much newer than the Philips). I kept it for use on my Toshiba and Sony but it's still a mystery why it doesn't work with the Philips. I don't call Philips anymore because of the useless and rediculous (and typical - unfortunately) customer support they provide. But I have to say that the seller of this remote (Dynamic Living) saw my negative feedback to the remote and called me right away to see how they could help and to offer to take the remote back. This impressed me and so I won't hesitate to buy from them again - unlike Philips, who I thought was a good company. I bought a TV and a DVD/VCR combination from them. The VCR has never worked and they were no help. Their only suggestion was that I go out and buy another Philips VCR - what a joke!"
3,Limited in functions,"Although this is large and doesn't get lost, the functions are limited. We have a vcr/dvd recorder combo that it can't handle. Better for the techno challenged as a basic remote."
2,Doesn't work with Direct TV,"I bought this remote for my aged in-laws who have difficulty in using their Direct TV remote because the buttons are so small. Unfortunately it did not work. Codes are provided to program Direct TV boxes, but they would not work either. I called Direct TV for support; they stated that only remotes with Direct TV logos will work for their boxes.Otherwise, I think this product met our expectations. It worked fine with their RCA TV."
2,be aware no 'input' function for TV,"As a multi device universal remote, it is useless without an 'input' button for the TV to enable viewing with the DVD. So I have a remote that I cannot use, that will cost me half of what I spent on it to return it. The manufacturer, when called, admitted the flaw in design of the product and that they are currently considering the need for an 'input' function."
1,Does not operate basic cable box (can't change channels),"Bought this for my 85 year old mother-in-law with declining vision. She loved the buttons, size and fact that buttons light up, but it won't work the basic cable converter box (she has WOW, but I also checked at home and it wouldn't operate my Comcast box either), so it is useless and I will have to return and get one that I can program using a learning function with the cable remote rather than just set-up codes. They should make this very clear in the product desctiption!"
1,disapointed,I thought it would be great but.. I found it difficult to program . I can't get the tv and the dvd to work.I use it but I also use the remote for dvd which defeats the purpose of buying this item. I am 70 yrs. maybe that's why.
2,Not for me,I purchased this remote and was immediately suprised by the size. I have large hands and this remote felt uncomfortable to use. I did not like the red color glow it puts out when you push any button. I did not like the idea that a button has to be pushed before buttons lite up. This remote did not program 2 of the 3 electronics I needed to control. Refund!!
1,Big numbers not good on all cable boxes,Bought this for my 91 year old Mom because she is almost blind. There are no remotes that will work with the Comcast HD Box had to send it back!
1,Hideous!,I suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something. But......dear GOD that thing is ugly!
4,The price was right,I have been using these sony tapes for almost 10 years now and never had a problem. I will however be looking forward to using other media that go with HD video. It has been a nice run Sony :) Thank you!
5,Dangerous Expectations,"In ""People in Quandaries,"" the speech pathologist Wendell Johnson describes the causes and effects of the IFD cycle. In this series of reactions, I, unrealistic expectations and ideals, lead to F, frustrations, which discourage us, and may delude us with even less realistic expectations or ideal; the IFD can quickly become viciously circular.Probably the IFD cycle affects almost everyone to some degree: who doesn't have some ultimately frustrating expectations? But instead of letting our frustrations discourage or delude us, we can and should learn from them; some mistakes may prove worth making for the sake of the discoveries they lead to.""People in Quandaries"" includes some semantic exercises with which we can learn how to learn; by recognizing the limitations of our expectations and language, we can learn to see beyond them."
2,Misleading title,"The title of the book is completely misleading. Actually the book vacillates between a mechanic description of kabbalah tree, an interpretation of a painting, Jewish alphabet and various religious points of view. At the end, the reader is left with some information which by no means will lead him/her to an inner balance. This is a purely theoretic book and has nothing to do with spiritual growth."
1,This book is misleading,"This book is more closely related to the NCR/Teradata approach to data warehousing than is divulged in the book and the authors' bios. It's a vendor specific sales tool masquerading as a book. This kind of ""book"" is what consultants might like to hand over with a sales proposal tucked inside to add legitimacy. I would suggest that any reader of this book read it critically in light of the NCR/Teradata connection given that the ""secrets"" are consistent with the NCR/Teradata approach to data warehousing, but not the wider world of data warehousing."
1,Narrow approach and vendor specific,"I believe this book will only be useful to companies using NCR Teradata systems. The approach is very vendor-specific and uses methods that are most practical with NCR. If you want to learn about good data warehouses and such, you'd be better off looking at ""Best Practices"" presentations and papers at the Data Warehouse Institute."
5,Who Really Needs This Book!,"An outstanding contribution to the Data Warehousing world. Who should read this book? Top executives ,directors and those who want a data warehouse constructed. Secrets of the Best Data Warehouses in the World focuses on good common sense and a logical approach to building a successful warehouse. To develop a successful data warehouse begins with the education of those funding and sponsoring it, and this book provides that education. As a warehousing professional and project manager, I have seen all too often the unsuccessful implementation of a data warehouse due to lack of commitment and a misunderstanding as to the rewards that can be reaped. Note to those who are engaging in a data warehouse project...buy this book!"
5,The Worrywarts,"We love The Worrywarts! This book immediately became my four-year-old's favorite storybook. We never get tired of reading about the adventures of Wombat, Woodchuck, and Weasel.Caution and worry seem to be a big part of parenting a young child, but the three characters in Pamela Duncan Edwards' story remind us to keep our worries in perspective.Wombat, Weasel, and Woodchuck venture out to explore the world. Each time fear starts to overcome one, the others use humor and practicality to meet any challenges they encounter.The illustrations are bright and fun. Edwards' use of alliteration makes the book so entertaining to read aloud. (Not to mention a great book to share when studying the letter ""W."")"
4,What if...,"What if you were reading a wonderfully wacky book about a wombat a weasel and a woodchuck who wanted to wander the world and your woefully weary wee-ones began wiggling under their wraps, wracked with guffaws?If you are reading The Worrywarts, the scenario is not far-fetched!Silly illustrations abound to accompany this truly innovative story line involving unheard of scenarios Wombat, Weasel and Woodchuck might encounter. Fortunatley, by thinking - and planning - ahead, they are able to thwart all of the scary things that may have awaited them.The emphasis on the letter ""w"" is an added bonus to this addictive storybook."
3,Closer to new age musique than ethnic jazz.,"In part, reminds me of the thrilling persussive ""Apocolypse Now Sessions""... but... with a somewhat weak link, Wolfgang Puschnig. (the sax and flute player) He sounds a lot like Jan Gabarek without any shading,timbre, ""outness"" etc.Hence, this cd falls closer to a pleasant new age sound as opposed to ethnic jazz despite the gallant efforts of Zakir, Airto, et al."
5,Simple fun,I have two daughters ages two and four who love playing with My Little Pony toys. This pony is great because she comes with high heels and is dressed like a bride. It's fun to see them use their imaginations when they play with these toys. They don't make any noise or need batteries!
3,Really Lite!,"I purchased these gel pads because they were at a very affordable price, and I was extremely pleased with the service of this company. The product came extremely quickly, was packaged very well, and customer service was fantastic!The gel pads however, are exactly as described, really lite! I tried them on for a pointe shoe class, and couldn't stand in them very long because they did not provide enough support. It really hurt. Perhaps, this would be more suited for a more experienced dancer who needs to feel the floor, but for the dancers that only take pointe once or twice a week, I recommend the thicker gel pads by Leo's also available from this company, which I exchanged with no problem!Overall, it was a great experience with this company, but it is a bit hard to order dance supplies without trying them on first."
3,"good shipping, bad product","thought it would be the same as others I had gel but these are very thin at the tip and I ran. least to my students who are starting to work point. not recommend, what you pay."
4,"Thinner, still comfy, but not as streatchy","The category is kind of misleading, these are not exactly ""nail tools"", they are for dancers to wear with pointe shoes.I have the pink one,These are thinner thanEurotard Pointe Comfort Ultra Liteand you definitely can feel the floor better.They are less stretchy and less plush, however they do provide a very pain-free feel (mind I've been dancing en pointe for more than 8 years). I think both beginners and advanced dancers can use this. but perhaps not for first dancers who are very sensitive to pain.This also does not use up as much room in the box, however I still feel that the size of the pad is slightly narrow. I have wide squared toes, so if you have narrow feet this may actually be wider for you.For me, they are not as sweaty nor do they rip so easily as other dancers have noted, however I'm sure everyone is different.I do use baby powder and I have not felt any slip, I do wear them under my convertible tights."
3,No Creston? No Husa? No Whitney?,"It's unfortunate that this album is billed as a ""definitive"" recording of standard works for saxophone and band when it only includes one real ""standard"" (the Dahl concerto). Why didn't he perform the Creston Concerto, which is certainly a fundamental part of the repertoire? There are many gaps in the program..."
1,Awful,"I bought this because of the Bolcom Concert Suite, but shouldn't have bought it. This recording is awful! Bolcom calls this piece a ""High wire act for saxophone"", yet the altissimo is awful, inaccurate, and even taken down an octave. It's as easy as this, if you can't play altissimo, then you can't play this piece. Along with horrible altissimo, the rest of the piece has wrong notes, lack of expression. I can't get over that they are selling this! I would really like my money back. If you are interested in the Bolcom, check out Timothy McAllister's recording, much much better, worth the money, correct notes, and nice altissimo. I read a review before I bought it saying it wasn't that great, but I didn't believe them, and thought one more recording of the piece would be nice...I was wrong, take my advice"
1,Yet to receive,Have not received the first issue of this magazine. Not sure if I will ever get it. When will I get the magazine or my refund?
4,Supreme combination,"As this CD is not love at first like Making music, it delivers more and more with each listen. If you are fan of any of them add this one to your collection."
1,"Dark screen, hard to use","The laptop and the games seem okay, but we found this toy almost unable to use because the screen is so dark and there are no controls to make it brighter. The only control that exists is the contrast control, which doesn't make anything easier to see. Thus, rather than strain our daughter's eyes every time she would use this laptop, we simply returned it."
3,ok,"Not what I expected. It is cool looking, almost like a real laptop but I thought it was going to be actual missions like it says. There's no mission. It just says ""your mission is to find the missing letter"" etc. in each category. Then it pops up with different words. The words and other activities are not challenging enough for my 7 year old. I think next year we'll go the route of a regular laptop for him. This is made for a lot younger age category. Maybe 5 would be more the right age. He loves the design of it and keeps it on his desk to look like a real laptop. He also likes that he has a mouse with it. As far as using it though, he's only played with it twice since Christmas, so I'm a little disappointed. Like I said, maybe more for a 5 year old this would be a great starter computer."
5,Truly a very entertaining book!,"This book is a very entertaining read. It has several delicious recipes also. If you've never been to the Gulf Coast, this is one of the best books to read. If you have been to the Gulf Coast, you will also enjoy this book. Mulletheads Unite!"
3,LAND OF HOPE % DREAMS,"The new CD is pretty good and I got this already but I got this one for the Live version. It's typically ""LIVE"" in that it drags on at the end but otherwise a good song."
2,Not very good lead single from the Boss.,"I love the Boss. He has written a tone of great songs and has made some really great albums. It is a shame that the Rising is the weakest first single from an album that the Boss has ever released. When compared to Born To Run from Born To Run, the Rising is weak. When compared to Prove it all Night from Darkess on the Edge of Town, and Hungry Heart from the River, the Rising is weak. When compared to Atlantic City from Nebraska and Dancing in the Dark from Born In The USA, the Rising is weak. When compared to War from Live 1975-1985 and Brilliant Disguise from Tunnel of Love, the Rising is weak. When compared to Human Touch as a first single from even that album, the Rising is weak. When compared to Better Days from Lucky Town, the Rising is weak. Hopefully, the new CD will be better than this first single."
1,"very bad sound, bad tracks...","this is not good. boring tracks... and a sound mostly recognizable as the sound of a car with newly married inside, with this cans hanging after it slammin' against the street. Also: Springsteen has gone to believe more into God then to ROCK N' ROLL! What's wrong with him!?"
2,been there done that,Same old type of book you can get anywhere. I found one stitch that I have not used and no patterns that were worth the price of the book.
3,It's an okay book,Book shows you the a few of the very basic crochet stitches and then teaches you how to use the stitches in various items. I have seen better crochet books then this.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, IF YOU LIKE STELLA RIMINGTON'S BOOKS!","Utterly shocking.This book was presented on Amazon as being written by John Buchan and Stella Rimington.I loved Dame Stella's books and thought this might be a joint effort early in her writing career.Well, it wasn't, in fact this book was likely written before Rimington was even born.She was merely asked to write an introduction,and then Amazon presents this book in an ambiguous way to suggest she's a co-author.Definitely feel utterly ripped off."
2,Inaccurate Account of Sarah & Abraham,"I usually love books by Gilbert Morris, however this one is severely flawed. When writing a novel based on a Bible character, I think it should be as accurate as possible. Yet Mr. Morris circumvents the topic that Abraham and Sarah are half-brother and sister (as stated by Abraham in Genesis 20:12-13 when justifying himself to King Abimelech). Instead, Abraham & Sarah have supposedly never met before their engagement in ""No Woman So Fair"". Unlikely. Also, Abraham gives a cheesy answer to the Pharaoh of Egypt as to why he stated Sarah was his sister and not his wife. In the Bible, Abraham does not answer the Pharoah, but later addresses this question when answering King Abimelech (Genesis 20:11). Christian historical and bibliographical fiction using Bible characters should be built upon what is already known, not override the truth."
2,Not very realistic.,"This was a used book and not in the best of conditions. The story is based on a Bible character, but it goes on and on about a figure sho is only mentioned in one verse in the Bible. He runs a good yarn, but not very realistic."
3,Good but not as good as Heart of a Lion,"The second book of the series, ""A Woman So Fair"", was good but did not keep me attention like ""Heart of a Lion"". It started out good but was slow in the middle. Thankfully, the book ended as good as the beginning, if not better. Morris stretched out the story of Abram and Sarai when a shortened version would have been enough for us to get the point. I would recommend this book but read ""Heart of a Lion"" about Noah first. I loaned it to my friends and they couldn't put it down."
2,thunderring,the CD was in good shape for being used but the music was only so-so with only one hit song.
5,amazingly beautiful,"I own a number of Emmylou's albums but this is the one I cherish most of all. The opening song,'Heaven Only Knows', sets up the CD wonderfully and every song is sung with a depth of sensitivity and emotion unmatched in so many other singers. It's hard to pick out the best tracks as each one has so much within it and I truly believe that this album has to be listened to as a complete package but 'Icy Blue Heart', 'You've Been On My Mind' and 'No Regrets' are unmissable.This is possibly the most 'downbeat' of Emmylou's albums, dealing as it does with loss and pain ('I Cried A River', 'I Still Miss Someone', 'You've Been On My Mind', 'Lonely Streets')but this may be just what makes it so breathtakingly spectacular.Buy it and be amazed."
3,Good but unstable,"My 4 yr old loved it but when he reves it up and the thing starts to walk, it tumbles down after a short distance, specially on a carpet. Looks like the designer did not thing about it's center of gravity issues. I guess he focussed on making a BBIIIGGG foot size to make it stable but even that doesn't work much."
1,POS,"First of all, I just bought this 2 weeks ago and paid 23.00 and now I see it's 1/2 price. Piece of junk- no velocity, jams-I've had $8.00 guns that worked better. Daisy should be ashamed!!"
2,CRAPP!!!!!!,"This gun's spring gets weaker over a course of literally 3 weeks of light use. Not even worth $5. If you think 213fps is alot, you have problems. I personally think 350fps is weak too. You're better off buying a cybergun spring handgun. Take this advise and buy a stronger and longer lasting gun. ( trying to make it stronger by stretching the spring, and or wd-40 ing it DOESN'T work, only makes it weaker)"
5,Sooooooooo pretty,My hubby received this as a birthday present. It is so pretty. The Waterford name is worth the price. SUPER
5,Wonderful CD!,"I've always loved songs of the sea and so I was an easy sell on this CD. Still I think anyone who loves Jimmy Buffet, Gordon Lightfoot, or Great Big Sea will love this music."
3,"Vol.11: Men, Men, and MORE Men","Another fun collection. Highlights this time:""HARRY CHESS VS. THE PYTHON"" by ""A.JAY"" -- Another hilarious farce with spies and sex; I only wish the art was reproduced larger, there's too much detail here to appreciate in this format!""SKY-HIGH AND HARD"" by ""SEAN"" -- Window-washers get stuck outside a building-- then get it on, before finding they're not the only workers having fun that night. As always, ""Sean""'s work deserves a collection all his own.Other highlights include ""MURPHY'S MANOR"" by Kurt Erichsen, ""JAYSON"" by Jeffrey A. Krell, ""KAKE"" by ""Tom of Finland"", ""KIDNAPPED"" by ""Stephen"", 15 assorted pages from Howard Stangroom & Stephen Lowther, 11 cartoons by Gerald Donelan, and front & back covers by ""Etienne""."
5,Dallas Cowboys Rock!,This product is one of the best I have purchased representing the Dallas Cowboys. It is sturdy and hangs lovely without wrinkling. Dries quickly when I wet it by mistake. I love it!
2,You'd be better off with a cell phone on silent mode....,"I was lured to buy this massager by its price, and the fact that it's cordless. It has two speeds, a flexible massage head, and it isn't very loud, heavy or bulky. And that's a wrap for the good stuff.I must say, I was very disappointed in the overall performance of it. The vibrations are about as powerful as the average cell phone, and that's on the highest speed. It can be used while charging, but the vibrations felt are more weak than the lowest setting.The verdict? This thing is a joke. It simply isn't intense enough to be useful. Oh, and thinking about buying this for ""alternate"" purposes? You'll be disappointed. Spare yourself the frustration and get a Hitachi Magic Wand, or if you have your heart set on something cordless, try the Acuvibe Softtouch Massager."
4,Not bad for the money.,"I love the fact that it is cordless, and the head is relatively soft. It could be more powerful but adequate for the amount paid for it."
3,"Nice TV, but not the best","TV has no inputs for a center channel so one must be set on top. My first unit had a black spot on the screen, I couldn't find anyone to do warranty work for Philips (neither could they). After 7 weeks of calls, emails, waiting on parts, and finally a complaint against Philips to the Better Business Bureau and a credit card dispute. The store I purchased the unit from agreed to exchange it for me.Make sure there are no flaws in yours before you get it home, it is a pain to get someone to do anything for you after that. Philips made no efforts whatsoever to get this matter resolved, I had to call each repair center myself.The Ultravision (Hitachi) seemed to have a better picture."
3,Not a bad map,A little hard on the eyes. It would be nice if it were bilingual. Good that it is laminated. Check out the Hong Kong MTR website and the maps around the train station. They're detailed and can be printed out.
1,What were they thinking?,"What? Were they contractually bound to do an album or something? Mary Mary is one outstanding & classy act, both live and recorded. Of course I purchased this project sight unseen because of their reputation - they have put out some amazing work. But this one had me going ""things that make you go hmmmm?"" Two tracks to California Christmas? What's that about? The song is barely worth a first go round, so a second go is out of the question! There is little that Warryn Campbell produces that does not appeal to me. He is a super-talented producer. However, this project is a miss. Sorry guys, I'm usually behind you all the way, but, got to say, this was one disappointing project. Hubby and I listened to it through once and both agreed - straight to the play once in a blue moon box."
2,"Mary Mary, Quite Contrary....","I love Mary Mary, but I have to say that I was very disappointed with this cd. I was all hyped thinking they were gonna do that thang, NOT!But, all in all, I'm a fan and I will cop their next project. This one just didn't get the job done."
1,What Happened?,"Mary Mary should give a refund to everyone that purchased this cd. It's awful. I am a Mary Mary fan from the very first cd they put out, but this one is garbage. Come on now. I was shocked how sorry this one was."
5,retired nurse,"Bought this for my daughter,she has been playing it everyday even though it is Christmas music. she Love it.Great CD"
3,Mary Mary Christmas,"Yes, the album was too short, Yes, I personally think that they could have blessed us with more spiritual songs to reflect our LORD and KING, but all in all I STILL LIKED IT and PLAYED IT EVERYDAY. I especially like ""ONLY ONE..could be Savior only one could be King"" THAT WAS TRULY in Mary Mary Style! I love them NO MATTER WHAT, but I just hope they don't stray too far trying to reach the secular world that they forget that us TRUE CHRISTIANS want that MARY MARY from the FIRST THREE CDs. Even though CA Christmas wasn't your traditional spiritual christmas song, it was done in the spirit of fun and gave us a view of christmas without snow."
3,Great for nonbelievers too!!!,"I get tired of listening to the same old Christmas songs year after year. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the few traditional songs that are on this CD have been Mary Maryized quite nicely.This CD would also make a great stocking stuffer or grab bag gift for nonbelievers because it is upbeat and portrays the true meaning of Christmas. In a time when we are inundated with meaningless songs about snow, Santa and Christmas trees, it's nice to have something that we can give to our family members as a witness to what Christmas is all about.Christmas is just about the only time of year that many people are open to the message of Christ's birth. The message of the song ""Still The Lamb"" presents The Gospel quite nicely and would make a great way to subtly share it with those hard to reach family memebers."
4,Quite peaceful,"I am certainly not the most knowledgeable of New Age listeners. I do think this album is worth listening to and I personally think John Serrie did a fine job in his synth-to-flute blending. In fact, the balance of both is very good. ""Tuptim's Garden"" is probably my favorite.There are two or three tracks differing from the rest, but the change is not necessarily bad. Not the most consistent of New Age albums I've heard, but definately worth it if you're looking for quiet Native type of music.I don't think this makes good meditation music if that's what you're looking for. As a matter of fact, I don't think any music should be heard when meditating."
5,A great kids book!,"Even adults will find Mrs. Biddlebox and her antics amusing! She scoops up the totally rotten day and makes it into a cake and gobbles it all up! After yesterday, I couldn't think of a more appropriate story for me to read to my kids! It was one heck of a day at the office and I wish I could have scooped up all that stinkiness and made a cake out of it!It's a story about making lemonade out of lemons...of turning your frown upside down...of making the best of a bad day and having it end peacefully.I loved it, and so did the kids!"
3,Works to some extent,"I used this on my newly dyed very dark brown hair. My hair looked almost black in some areas with blonde highlights. I purchased the Color Zap and used it all over. After 30 minutes I rinsed the product from my hair and it was a bright orange color as expected. I did have areas that were still extremely dark but I think it's because the amount in one box wasn't enough. I then dyed it a light brown and it turned into a medium brown color.If you have shoulder length hair or longer, or have thick hair make sure to get two to three boxes because the mixture is very hard to spread and you won't have enough. Make sure to check your hair every 5-10 minutes as I rinsed mine out earlier than I thought I would hav e been able to. Overall this product did what it claimed and I am much happier with my current color."
5,Great book!,"This is my first time reading a book on American philosophy, and I love the book. Page by page, it is transforming the way I view the U.S., esp. the Civil War. I am a novice on the subject, but I find the writing thrilling."
3,"Some interesting content, but hard to follow","I bought this book looking for a description of the philosophy of the American pragmatists - William James in particular, but John Dewey as well. This book includes both those figures, as well as Oliver Wendell Holmes and others. The book goes into a lot of detail on the era in which they lived (which the author believes is necessary to understand their philosophies - fair enough) as well as considerable detail about their personal lives. Also relevant.I liked a lot of the information contained in the book, and thought it was worth reading to get that information. What I didn't like was the organization of the book - the author introduces a new character, then goes off on multiple tangential histories. By the time he gets back to ""the point"", I was often lost and had forgotten where he started.Overall I felt this book was worth reading, but I didn't get as much out of it as I think I could have if the structure had been a little more straightforward."
1,Metaphysical Liars,"Anyone who praises this book has never read it. Those who say they read it and liked it are lying through their teeth. Menand tries to explain science, and mathematics, about which he knows very little and the results are a mess. Over-written, poorly edited and not surprisingly it is available for $10 because no one in his right mind would pay full price for this junk."
2,Dry as Dust,"A dissenting view--I came to this book as someone who wanted a good introduction to Pragmatism. I have to say that I was disappointed. The book meanders all over the place, telling gossipy stories of the Civil War, Dartmouth College/University, and Hetty Green that the author barely bothers to tie into his main theme. I kept thinking, ""Okay, when are we going to get to the part about Pragmatism?"" Only in the last chapters do we finally get a comprehensive explanation of what Pragmatism is, but these chapters could easily be read on their own, without the buildup of all that came before.A very perplexing read. A book that isn't sure what it wants to be."
3,Try the audio abridgement,"Excellent idea and excellent writing. However the author is determined not to waste his research by making us read a lot of trivial details such as James' involvement in Hattie's trial.I kept trying to soldier on and tie things together, but gave up half way through. I am thinking of trying the audio abridgement."
4,Good biography of ideas,"I enjoyed this book as it was written as both a biography of people and ideas. It brought these characters to life and showed them as people, where they came from, how their thinking evolved and how they contributed to philosophy. I gave it four stars, because it was a little over my head at times. I'm not as familiar with these concepts as real philosophy aficionados, but I still enjoyed the book. If you're interested in the evolution of thought throughout the early 1900's, this book is definitely the right place to look. When I can more fully appreciate the content of this book I will probably go through it again and rate it as a five star masterpiece."
3,More Biography than Philosophy,"I found this book to be informative and engaging. It provided good social and familial background to the main characters of the book; William James, Wendell Holmes, and Charles Peirce.On the other hand, I was disappointed that the book did not have deep discussions of the ideas of these gentlemen. In fact, the discussion of pragmatism assumes that the reader already knows it or is familiar with it.I think the book could have benefited from a separate and distinct discussion of pragmatism and how it fitted into philosophical and intellectual ferment of the late 19-cenury Europe and North America.I wish the book had discussed the ideas of Justice Holmes in more detail as well.One of my other disappointments in this book was the absence of any discussion of Charles Peirce's Cosmology (his program) and where and how it failed as well as how it related to the ideas of A. N. Whitehead (alluded to in the text but never discussed)."
2,Perpetually on the verge,"This book, initially so promising, was ultimately extremely annoying. The essence of these philosophers' thought is suffocated by biographical mishmash and annoying side trips. As I turned the pages, I hoped that Menand would manage to tie all of his many loose strings together, or at least to explain with some clarity what his subjects had in common. No such luck. Three-quarters of the way through I abandoned hope. Pity the poor editor whose job it was to make a book of Menand's meanderings. I am totally mystified why this book garnered such nice reviews."
4,"Audio CD fine, direction and scope unclear","The audio CD set was fine, but it was mysterious why these particular figures were covered, and what scope of years was covered and why. The audio CD never stated what the theme, scope, or thesis was, so its coverage seemed arbitrary. So it's hard to say whether the book (as reflected in the CD) achieved its purpose.I may not be the best reviewer, as a philosopher who knows little so far about American intellectual history. This audio book was fairly edifying, but a bit mystifying as well. I may read the book to determine the conceptual scope.Aside from the lack of a roadmap and justification for its scope and figures covered, the audio CD was well executed and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for good nonfiction audio books."
2,"Oh, come on","Didn't anyone find this book overwritten and pedantic, not to mention highly unfocused and rambling? A good editor would have lopped 200 pages off, including the completely irrelevant long opening descriptions of Holmes' Civial War escapades. A better title: Name Dropping Through History."
1,Don't bother,This book is perhaps deep and thoughtful but it is unnecessarily obtuse and droning. The author loses sight of his goals on almost every page nesting stories within stories within stories like someone cackling on and on.It is inconcise dribbling on about information that it was clear the author dug up and was so excited about he just had to include it even though it was irrelevant. Combine that with an unnecessarily high-brow vocabulary and you have hard to understand and slow drum beating prose.While there is information in this book that is fascinating it is lost inside a poor writing style.
3,Listen to Amazon's song samples,I was pleased to get this CD as a gift because I generally like this kind of music. But this is not what I really expected and I hated it at first. I didn't make it past the first half dozen songs. I am currently giving it a second chance and do like it much better than I did originally.My best advice is that you listen the samples that Amazon makes available so that you know exactly what you are getting.
2,Poor transitions make the album hard to listen to,"I bought this cd for our daughter when she was just born and play it once in a while, but frankly, she just doesn't like it. The music is very inconsistant from song to song and while one is very calming and she'll fall right asleep, the next song will have a voice with a sort of a piercing cry that rouses her into a matching cry herself. The wailing voices of some Celtic music are beautiful to listen to, but don't seem to offer much comfort to our baby. This may be because she had colic and is very sensitive to sounds, but in any case, I also find the album on a whole disconcerting in its rough transitions from song to song."
2,It's okay...,"I thought I'd like this CD better. The music is alright, but with all the enchanting and melodic sounds of Irish heritage, I was slightly disappointed that the songs they chose weren't that great. I've been happier playing Enya ~"
4,Good compilation,"I am not sure about my baby, but I love this CD ! Actually baby loves it too but probably not to that great extent. :-)"
5,Celtic Sleep,"This CD was given to us as a gift when our son, Liam, was born. We have turned it on nearly every night when he goes to bed for over 2 1/2 years now. He's been learning Irish while he sleeps. We've played it so much that we need to buy another one. This is great music to raise your children on. Our son's a sweet charming boy....we're convinced, the lullabies have played a role."
3,cool,"Real cool stuff for an oldie. .realy liked the songs ""Nothing"" and ""never give up"" You can listen to them on cd baby."
1,terrible,Looks like I am odd man out here.Reading S.L. Viehls' books (I believe this is a pseudonym)- another one I could not even get through.
1,not worth the money,"This is an absolute waste of $$ plus shipping. It has one sentence per page, and cartoon diagrams that say simply ""don't get in a rut. And if you do, get out.""I was extremely disappointed."
3,"Good for shop work, but","for working overhead, or on staging or framing on the jobsite, it's a bit more awkward than a similar stick nailer. Changing nail sizes is a tedious little business, can't be done easily while up on a ladder, for instance, with different coils and different magazine settings while a few clips of stick nails fit easily and quickly in the nail bags. Coils are easily bent or bumped on a busy job, which makes them quite difficult to fit into the nailer. Get the stick version instead."
5,ACCOUSTIC BLUEGRASS,We actually met this group over the 4th of July at a campground in Colorado and was impressed with their improptu music/concert that they put on for everyone who was there. Wonderful upcoming group from Alaska!!! Looking forward to their next CD.
3,Not the same as pictured,We were disappointed to find out this item is not the same as the one pictured. The one pictured shows more bumpers and the Power Rangers on the table top - the one we got had three bumpers and two power rangers on the outside toward the back of the machine. Oh well - not a huge diff but the not same toy.
4,Made for a smaller waisted dog than mine.,"This is a very nice sweater, but it was too small for my dog even though I measured him for the sweater. It was long enough, but too small around the waist. I gave it to my sister for her dog though, and it fit her dog perfectly. I have a mid-sized Maltese, she has a poodle."
3,I would go a size up,My Shih Tzu is usually a medium and he fits in this sweater but it's just very tight. If you want the effect like this picture (the loose fit) I suggest at least go one if not two size up. The other problem is that it's kind of short. It only covers half of my dog's body right to his private part :p so that he can pee. You can easily buy one or two size up then sew the underneath belly part so that the back would be covered more and he can still pee without peeing on the sweater.
2,movies,was hard too watch. movie stopped all the time and it took so long to download it. i used amazon before for movies but this time was disappointed.
2,Starts out good then drags,Not as good as a movie with this two should be. It starts out pretty interesting but the plot moves slow throughout.
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"THIS MOVIE WAS OK....JUST OK....I PROBABLY GOT ABOUT 2-3 LAUGHS DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE FLICK.....THE SCENE WHERE HE POINTS OUT THE GUY HOLDING HIS FART AT THE OPEN HOUSE WAS HILARIOUS, I MUST SAY I LAUGHED MY A$$ OFF. PAUL RUDDS LOVE INTEREST WAS A HORRIBLE ACTOR, AND PAUL RUDD HIMSELF DIDN'T HAVE THAT MANY FUNNY MOMENTS. EVEN ANDY SAMBERG WAS GIVEN SOME CRAPPY LINES...IN THIS CASE THE MAJOR FLAW IN THE MOVIE WAS WRITING....I MEAN ACTORS CAN ONLY PULL OFF SO MUCH WITH OUT GOOD JOKES. THE MOVIE WASN'T HORRIBLE BUT I DON'T SEE IT AS A MUST HAVE LIKE : 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN OR KNOCKED UP OR SUPER BAD."
4,"i love this movie, man!","one of the more funnier romantic comedies in recent years, and that's saying a lot, because for as many romantic comedies that do get released in any year, not many of them are actually funny, let alone worth seeing...but this film right here, with paul rudd, jason segel, and the lovely rashida jones(daughter of music icon/producer quincy jones) will renew you interest in movies of this canon. this movie is given an ""r"" rating for good reason, as there are curse words galore, and crude sexual humour throughout, which is a funny thing when done right, and not for shock, as some comedies of late happen to do."
5,Best movie ever!,This movie is hilarious and very entertaining. We watch it often with new friends who have not seen it yet.
5,"Great movie, and finally...",This was a very funny and entertaining movie. The finally is because FINALLY an adult-themed movie with Jason Segel where you don't see his junk!!
4,Love this movie,"The dvd froze the first time I watched but I took it out, cleaned it and put it back in and it was fine. I didn't think I should have had to do this with it being a NEW dvd"
3,"Light and fun, worth seeing once","Enjoyable comedy about ""bromance"" (ok, the only time I'm ever going to use that word - I hate it!). The setup - man realizes that he has no best friend/man for his upcoming wedding, so he goes out to find one. A lot of movie cliches get thrown around (the ""man-child"", the ""gay guy"", the ""desperate girlfriend"", the ""bonding through music"", etc.). But it's salvaged by some decent writing, and likeable lead characters."
3,A lacking storyline.,"I think the previews of this movie made it seem better than it really is.I expected more laughs out of it, but instead got BASICALLY the same scene at least 10 times.Here's the gist:A couple gets engaged, and the groom-to-be has trouble finding a best man because for about his entire life ALL his friends have been women. Desperate to find a group of guy friends to call his own ;P he gets into a few ""man-dates"" before FINALLY finding a guy that seems to have potential ""bromance"" material. The groom-to-be and this guy soon become the best of friends, but eventually this ""bromance"" gets to be a bit too much for his fiance to handle, and a conflict breaks out between the two friends.While I wish this movie had more to the storyline, my boyfriend and I did get a few good laughs out of it, but this isn't a movie that I'd/we'd watch a second time in a row without at least a six months to a year time interval since the last time I/we saw it."
2,a kind of tastelss comedy about male friendships,The language is very open in this filmand some of the situations are maybe a little toographic for my taste.I really feel sorry for the people in this film and their lackof privacy and boundaries.I found a lot of this material just disgusting.
2,The Return of Ferrigno,This movie was ok. Just ok. It had some yucks in it but it wasn't a great comedy. Worth a watch but I don't think it is a repeater like 40 Year Old Virgin or Wedding Crashers. The Ferrigno stuff was mildly funny and Jamie Presly is hot as usual. Favreau was kind of wasted and didn't really do much of anything. Sarah Marshal was better.
1,Extremely boring and pointless movie,"Was not funny. It used the same type of humor that was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, and the 40 Year Old Virgin (and yes those movies had the same cast members). They are trying to sell us this type of humor over and over and in those movies it worked but in this movie it failed miserably. I am also sick of seeing the same people cast over and over again for these roles- you see a preview and you know right away what kind of movie it is and it is getting old. I had to turn this movie off after a while."
2,Don't waste your time,"I Love You,Man is slow and boring.NOT funny at all.If you must see this crap,borrow it,don't pay!It has been out for what,2-3 months,if that and you can buy it used for less than $5.00 People are lie ing through their teeth when they give this (movie)a four star rating.Stay home and watch TWO AND A HALF MEN,now that's a show worth watching.Make that into a movie."
1,Make a male friend,This movie is so bad... You want to go somewhere and weep... What in the Hell has happened to Hollywood. I cringe when someone gives me a gift card to a theatre. The premise is that this poor shy guy has no male friends and he needs someone to be his best man at his wedding. Is Brother is a Gay trainer in a gym and gives him advise on oh to meet guys.... Why doesnt he just use his brother as his best man for Gods sake. It just goes from bad to awful to awful to bad... their are no words to describe how awful this movie is.
1,not a very good movie,I thought this film was not good at all. It sort of dragged on and there wasn't much there to keep your interest. Foul language to shock you. A really crude character in the film I could do without. The acting wasn't much. There are better movies out there than this wast of time. Might I suggest Amerika or 500 Days of Summer which you will enjoy more than this bad film!
5,"I love this movie, man (minor spoiler)","With so many movies that have characters that turn out to be less than honest, true, and good, this movie is like a breath of fresh air to me. I watched the movie and had a few moments when I was thinking that someone would get screwed over because there was a scam involved. But after all was said and done, I came out feeling great. It's a movie about finding a best friend. I mean, what other better buddy flick is there! I know, it's a little extreme but I love you, man, is just something that I, IMHO, feel is just Awesome!!"
4,Rental Money Well Spent,"I was expecting a stupid-man flick and was surprised by the quality of this movie. It's not a great movie, but is definitely a good one for anyone looking for a lighthearted (but not stupid) look at what it's like to be a sensitive guy in a relationship."
2,Couldn't even finish it.,"This is one of my favorite movies so I was super excited to buy it and watch it. When I went to watch it, it skipped so much that I had to turn it off before the movie was over, super bummed!"
5,5 stars and super funny - item as described,"Extremely funny if you haven't seen it. You may have to watch it over again, but it's a great buy. Item shipped quickly and exactly as described. Will purchase from this buyer again!!"
1,"I Hate You, Man","I wonder if I watched the same movie as all the people shrieking about how fabulous it is. ""Great!...Laugh OutLoud!...Fantastic!...Gotta See This One!""For me, the movie lost it when it went into this prolonged sequence devoted to flatulence. This always gets the boys howling and slapping their knees, nudging each other and doubling over with hysteria. To me, it's boring, disgusting, brainless. And then we have the same comical performers that appear to have worked on every movie comedy for the past five years. We know their lovable mannerisms and can predict their dialogue before they even say it. Paul Rudd got boring fast when every scene pounded home to us that he's a real needy modern guy who needs the help of other guys to help him see the light.This movie is very much in the genre of Nice Guy Needs Help With Sex Life. All that was missing was Seth Rogan popping up to do his usual shouting, F___word spewing clown."
1,HORRIBLY FOUL - Turned off after 15 minutes,"After watching the preview for this movie on several different occasions, my wife and I were excited to finally sit down to watch this. WOW, were we in for a shock!The language and subject material was vulgar, to put it nicely, and just when you thought a funny part was coming, it was offset by something even more disgusting!We gave it 15 minutes, and then turned it off!Great storyline idea, but the preview showed only the best parts. In the end, though, it was too foul to redeem itself.Don't waste your time! It wasn't even worth our $1 rental price!"
2,OH MY GOD NOT THESE GUYS AGAIN,Seriously these guys make like a hundred movies a year since there debut in KNOCKED UP in 2007.Its seriously getting really annoying especially since i work at the movie thetare its so sad there constantly makeing films man they need the money that bad. The movie was alright worth to see BUT DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH on the dvd wait till it comes on tv and pay like under 5 dollars for it.
4,Good for some laughs,"Rudd and Segel are a great and believable duo that pair up for some creative comic situations. The movie occasionally leans too heavily on the overdone sex joke category but shines when Rudd and Segel are interacting. Rudd's character is painfully awkward and Segel's seems to be a stoner stereotype but he is able to break it from the typical mold. Enjoyable, funny, and worth a rental. As far as it being a movie I'll quote for years to come or one that I'll want to watch again soon- eh, its not that caliber."
3,Depends what kind of sense of humor you have!,This movie is definitely not Paul Rudd and Jason Segel's best work. It has some really funny moments but few and far between. I would suppose you'd probably have a very dry sense of humor to actually LOVE this movie but I do like the actors so I just had to see it.Paul Rudd is a girly man (girls just love him) and has no male friends so he sets out on an adventure to find a male friend who can be best man at his wedding. Careful what you wish for!
3,Have a fun as you wish!,"It's a comedy of a males, females their sexual inclinations and desires of having a fun while communicating with.What really makes me a bit confused is an Australian as-usual-vogue classification allowing minors to improve their swearing and sex-exercising in-progress."
5,Mind Boggling!,"Truely a groundbreaking performance!,well they always did in any of their four albums!, What precission? what syle?..they know their stuff..being an indian i know the complexity and the scientific boundries in indian classical music..i was stunned to hear mclaughlin belting it out and breaking traditions..with supeb speed through his scalloped fretboards guitar..a sudden dose of the 10 string stereophonicviolin..invented by l.shankar and the thundering percussions..makesup the music to look like what if jimi hendrix was a jazz guitarist joined by yehudi menuhin and backed by tony williams and mongo santamaria..this is it guys...u've got it!"
5,Outstanding,"Outstanding. Go for it. They are all, ALL masters in Shakti. A tremendous, trail-blazing band that defined genuine fusion (maybe even world music?) way back in the '70s before it became fashionable."
5,Beautiful,"Soulful, smooth, distinctive...Paul Taylor is one of my favs on the jazz scene. He didn't disappoint with Pleasure Seeker, it will forever be apart of my collection."
5,Groove Zone....!!,"I normally hate so-called 'smooth jazz'(the whole genre just seemed to cater to people who were too lazy to fully appreciate real jazz), but for some reason this classic from 5 years ago just speaks to me. Whether it's the cool techno-funk feel and exotic percussive textures of the opener ""Groove Zone"", or simply the passion and fervor with which Mr. Taylor plays, I simply love this CD! Maybe I'm getting to be a bit of a softy in my old age, but for smooth, relaxing sounds from a truly gifted young axeman, seek your pleasure right here!"
5,"DEEP,SOULFUL & PUMPING!!","THIS IS MY FIRST PURCHASE OF PAUL TAYLOR..WOW! THIS CD IS SO RICH IN SOULFUL, DEEP SOOTHING MUSIC. EVERY TRACK IS HOT. THE BEST CD I'VE PURCHASED ALL YEAR. WHAT A RELAXER AT THE END OF A LONG DAY. KEEP 'EM COMING PAUL...PLEASE!!"
5,AWESOME!!!,Paul Taylor is one of the best Contempary Jazz Artists of today!!! Pleasure Seeker is wonderful from start to finish.
4,Christmas Cheer,"If you're an intermediate guitarist or better, you'll find these songs a lot of fun. These are soloist arrangements for the finger picker, so all you pentatonic blues/rock guys out there might struggle at first with teasing the simultaneous melody and base lines off the chord progressions, but the education you'll get is well worth the effort. I tossed my pick away years ago, and I never looked back. My only critique is that five of the twelve songs are arranged in alternate tunings."
4,nice arranged and very chrismassy,"there's another chrismas book from mark ,having a different version silent nite (alternate tune), and some other cool songs i recomend it's amust have,this book basically combined from the previous video chrismas 1 and 2."
4,Fingerstyle Christmas Guitar,"Great collection of songs in TAB and standard notation. It is very helpful that Mr. Hanson arranged these songs within the book in 3 groups, according to the skill level needed to play them. Even the ""beginner"" category songs sound very full and satisfying.Hauntingly beautiful arrangement of ""Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence.""Only gripe is that the songs in the book are not in the same order as on the CD. No real harm done but it would have made it a bit more convenient to be able to listen to all of the selections in one sitting while paging through the book normally.Highly recommended."
1,theres just something about this book that makes it boring,"I have read the book Little Women and I thought it was excellent, but this book Amy's story bored me to death. I don't know why, but I really didn't like it."
5,A must for all serious poker players!!!,"When I wear my poker shirt, I feel as if I've just won the WSOP. Even when I'm playing online I wear it. It gives me an edge and makes me feel like a millionaire. The admiring glances I get in Casino's make my night, even when I lose!! Sometimes other players at the table are so engrossed looking at it that they lose their concentration giving me an even bigger edge than my 30 years poker experience. My next poker book is due to be published soon and I'll be wearing my shirt on the front cover. I've got a spare one just incase this one gets damaged. Don't order 1.......ORDER 2!!!.........and good luck at the tables...see you there! You can't miss me!"
2,"Great book, but too many errors in the Kindle edition","I purchased this title in the Kindle edition. The book is very good, and I love the author, but the Kindle book has far too many errors for something that cost almost ten dollars. I have discovered errors on nearly every page, most usually the substitution of the letter 'd' for 't'. Some words are pure gibberish."
3,Translation has problems,"I agree with the other reviewer who said that the translation of this book is sorely lacking. There are multiple examples of poor (or really, lack of) translation of Dutch words into English. I find this interesting since the author wrote in both English and Dutch and lived in the USA at the end of his life. You would think that Amazon could provide an E-Book with a decent translation. I doubt that the printed version has these errors, and if I am paying as much for the E-Book as for the printed version, I would expect the quality to be equivalent.Fortunately, the translation problems don't really keep you from understanding the story and it is a clever addition to the Dutch detective novels. It does help to have a Dutch - English dictionary handy, however."
3,A Bit Too New Age,"Mark O'Connor has played on hundreds of country albums as a session artist (guitar, fiddle), but you wouldn't know it from this 1988 album where he veers off dangerously close to new age territory. [On ""Two Creations"" he only plays chimes, for crying out loud!] However, he plays some stellar gut-string guitar on ""The Inns of Granny White/Elysian Forest (#39 & #40),"" and on the traditional fiddle tune ""Miss Sally Goodwin"" O'Connor improvises nicely over the course of a 10-minute live romp with Jerry Douglas on Dobro and Russ Barenberg on mandolin. This final track is easily the highlight of the album."
2,Samsung MM-A900,Decent Holster if you don't have to remove it from the holster while inside a car. Mine broke within 4 days while getting into my car.
5,"24"" Tripod Case...","Before buying this product I accidentally bought a 30"" Tripod case on Amazon from a vendor, the vendor was kind enough to get the product back and not charge me with re-stocking fee.Anyways I have a Sun-Pak tripod with Roller ball head on top, So I got this tripod cover and its a Perfect fit. The quality is good and easy to carry. There is a small zip where you can put your Camera Lens cover or something even a small wallet.Overall It's a good product and well built, I haven't used it in Rain, however I think it will do not harm to Tripod in Rain too."
5,Great case !,This case fits my tripod perfectly and I highly recommend it to serious photographers. It thoroughly protects my tripod and keeps it dry in all conditions.
5,Great Value for the Price,"I just received two of the Slik medium tripod carrying cases-one for my tripod and one for my husband's. I am extremely pleased with the product. Very well made, good fabric, and generously sized. I am even more pleased considering the low price of the case. I feel I received great value for my money. I think even a slightly larger tripod than both of ours would fit. If you are considering ordering this product, the length is true and the width is across an end. Kind of hard to describe but lots of room. I would order the same product again."
2,Vinyl Repair -Clear Liquid,"Not really a cement. Fills in the crack, but doesn't really weld the vinyl back together. The ""cement"" can be scraped away after it dries. Doesn't make a strong bond."
1,cracks in cold,"I used this to repair an inch-long cut in vinyl rain boots. VLP initially appeared to do the trick, but after wearing the boots one time in snow with 20 degree Fahrenheit weather, the repair cracked and peeled apart. With some experimenting, I determined this product simply doesn't hold up to cold temperatures."
2,Will not sharpen and hold an edge,"I am not at all satisfied with these tools, they certainly are not near the quality of my Sorbey ones.The have a rough edge when I am done sharpening on the same grinder and 100 grit stone that I have used for years and what little edge I do get dulls quickly."
3,PSI Woodworking LCBT4 4 Piece Bowl Turning Lathe Chisel Set,"Good price,cheap but useful storage box,not very sharp out of the box. Now that they have been sharpened they are working good."
5,Great beginner bowl chisle set,Great value for the price. Balanced tool and handles. Excellent for turning medium bowls. Side scraper especially helpful. End scraper a little large for small bowls. I use the smaller of the two gouges all the time. I'd buy another set if I needed to.
4,Secret of Roan Inish,"The Secret of Roan Inish is a family video in the nicest sense. It can be enjoyed by both adults and children with neither becoming bored. The story telling within the story is gripping. It is a memorable video. I wish there were more movies made like this. My children, boys ages 11 to 13 enjoyed it. Younger children and girls would also enjoy it."
1,I HATED IT,"WHEN I SAW THE MOVIE, IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO FINISH WATCHING IT. I THOUGHT THE PLOT WAS SO BORING. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE. I WATCHED THE MOVIE WITH MY FRIEND AND MY MOTHER AND WE ALL AGREED THAT IT WAS A VERY DUMB MOVIE. IT DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR."
5,Awesome!,"I have loved this movie since my daughter was little (she's 16 now). She still loves it, too! It's a fanciful, refreshing story; something that is hard to come by nowadays. We started cycling out our VHS tapes and wanted to be selective about which movies to purchase as DVDs. The Secret of Roan Inish was one of my first picks! And, as is usually the case, the DVD came quicker than expected."
5,A Most Beautiful Film,"This is a visually lovely, well acted, heartwarming, whimsical movie. We all loved it- my husband and I, my teenage daughter and our six year old daughters. There's a tinge of sadness, as the little girl's mother is dead and her father doesn't take good care of her, so she goes to live with her grandparents. There isn't a lot of action. It's a quiet movie, not huge special effects or big action scenes. It has a dreamy quality. Also, the Irish accents are such a pleasure to hear!"
5,"Nice, sweet movie","If you are looking for an action flick...go elsewhere.However, if you are looking for a nice, sweet movie you can watch with your whole family without getting embarrassed or offended this is the one for you.This quiet tale is the story of a young girl who returns from the city to live with her grandparents in the country. She becomes involved in an adventure when she discovers that her brother who was believed lost at sea as an infant is actually still alive and being cared for by seals. (Hey, if you can buy that a man can crawl up walls using his spider powers, this really isn't that far-fetched.)What ensues is a calm (although sometimes it may be intense for the younger ones) film that won't give you a headache or make your kids pick up any bad habits."
5,Silkies,I am of the West of Ireland where the Silkies live side-by-side with ondines and cluricauns and other assorted members of Yeats' Sidhe. A movie well worth the watch.
5,Roan Inish: A wonderfully uplifting film.,"The Irish film, ""Secret of Roan Inish"", is a wonderful piece of work, for families or serious film lovers. This story of a young Irish girl's unremitting belief in magic, and nature, and the possibilities of this life, would bring a smile to even the most cynical viewer.The film is masterfully cast, and beautifully and simply filmed. I do believe that what makes Celtic culture so magnetic and charming is its continuing love of this planet, and its deep spritual belief in magic and mystery. What a great film!"
5,"Wonderful, charming, fulfilling.","I love this movie very much, it shows a beautifully simple life, and the love of the sea. It is a good movie for the entire family, or just for yourself. The scenery and animals are as colorful and amazing as the cast!"
3,Great movie! Bad acting!,They did a very good job on this movie. But the acting was very weak. I think that they could have picked much bettter actors. I loved the story line.
5,Excellent,"A truly charming film, with wonderful actors, which captures the very essence of rural Ireland and its windswept islands offshore. Few movies can be shown to children these days; however, this is one that can. Jeni Courtney as ""Fiona"" is terrific, and a remarkable young actress.Having spent time on the unspoiled coast and in the quaint villages of County Donegal, this film brings it to life for all to see and enjoy. It is a magical movie and I recommend it to anyone—unless magic and ""fairies"" have gone out of your life, in which case this film and “Finding Neverland” (with brilliant acting by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet) might bring them back."
5,great movie,"family story and i dont want to do 14 more words this is ridiculous, let me submit this stilly review"
5,great service,I always get great service from amazon. You always give me an estimateddelivery time and my order always comes in earlyLove ordering from Amazon.
5,The secret is out,This movie is cute and very entertaining.... Its one of my favorite cause its original and imaginative!!!!
2,The College Student's Introduction to Theology,the book had notes in most of the pages. the notes were very offensive. I believe that books for sale should not have personal comments.
4,BOYER IS BRILLIANT,"As Garbo's last dramatic role, this is often included in the retrospectives that have kept her genius visible to new generations. For the only time in Garbo's starring career, her male opposite had a more interesting role than her own in CONQUEST. Charles Boyer, as Napoleon was the flame around which his Polish mistress, Marie Walewska, fluttered in this Samuel Hoffenstein-Salka Viertel-S.N. Behrman script; their doomed affair is superbly acted by both stars under Clarence Brown's able direction. However, it DOES lack the bravura scenes which made CAMILLE so special. Although she looks utterly beautiful, Garbo seems a bit exhausted - like she was still recovering from her extraordinary previous performance. Expensively mounted by Bernard Hyman, this film didn't earn back its cost in America, but it did beautifully overseas. The supporting cast is mostly excellent; it includes Dame May Whitty, Leif Erickson, George Zucco and the great Maria Ouspenskaya."
4,conquest,For fans of old Hollywood black and white film! A classic love story with excellent visuals. I would recommend this movie.
5,"Great stuff, I wish I could find more like it","A friend brought this to me to listen to after I mentioned my love of old Western music from the 20's. Just like the title says, I found this to be a modern take on good old-fashioned Western music with a definite folk leaning. I think anyone who likes folk, or Country-Western would enjoy this CD. There's even a few songs that sound like Gordon Lightfoot's earlier folk songs."
5,An original album,"The more I listen to this CD, the better it gets. The playing is flawless and the singing is beautiful. Several of these pieces should become folk classics. This work deserves wide circulation.The other reviews are right on."
2,A real let down!,This album was over-hyped and could not live up to expectations. I think that Lexxus definitely has the voice and flow but his album contained a lot of cross-over themes combined with weak beat selection. This album pales in comparison with Heads High by Mr.Vegas or Sean Paul's debut album.
3,"just a plastic case, nothing to rave about","fits together ok, you know like a big egg carton, nothing special but keeps bow safer and out of the way of stuff fo sho"
3,OK for the price,I didn't expect much for the price but needed a case for my trip. It worked for what I bought it for but is not the sturdiest case. Like I said it's OK for the price.
5,BUY THIS CASE,"Great case. So glad I bought this. Very sturdy and will keep your bow safe. Will hold a large bow. Case has lock holes for you to stick your lock through to keep kids out. An added bonus is that it is ""Made in the USA""."
5,Simply the BEST!,"For committed Christians, we know we must live a disciplined lifestyle to honor God, to walk in His power, to be an effective witness and to prosper. This book goes straight to the heart to convict and bring the child of God to a mindful state of repentance. What else can there be when we know the end from the beginning and have only one direction to travel? The enemy steals an inch at a time. He can be so deceptive it's practically unnoticeable, but it becomes obvious when it has accumulated over time and we taste the destructive force of it. Sit and read this book in a quiet place and let the Holy Spirit minister to you in His still, small voice. Just get honest with yourself and make a decision to return and be seated in heavenly places. You want God's peace to rule in your heart, don't you? I highly recommend this work to any Christian with a desire to have God complete His work in him."
4,Beautiful!,"What a gorgeous book. It's written to appeal to a young audience, but anyone can enjoy the stunning photographs. It makes you appreciate the inherent beauty of storms. It covers everything from Clouds, to rain, to tornados. As well as providing information about each subject, it often includes safety information for children which I found to be very responsible."
5,"Awesome souka music, much better than today's","Tambu no longer does music from what I've heard, and souka has been down graded into meaningless electronic jumble. Tambu, playing in the late 80's and 90's, was the REAL DEAL!!! And Charlies Roots was the best band going . . Each of the songs had stories, and the stories had stories -- very political underneath, and very fun clever lyrics in the surface story. Totally brilliant. I want Tambu to sing again!!!"
5,Kidcordance is Kidfriendly!,"Not only can the Bible be confusing for adults, but imagine how it is for kids! My child just finished her kindergarten year at a Christian school and came home on a regular basis with a lot of questions about the Bible. This book made it very easy for me to answer her questions on a level that she can understand. We are able to read it together - she enjoys the illustrations, and the ""didjaknow"" facts for each word, that gives her additional tidbits of information. She likes the fact that the book not only explains words found, but gives references to Bible verses, so that she can find them in her own Bible."
3,"Cute, but not made well","First off, these bags originally retail for $98. I don't know where the $122 comes from (so it's not on sale!). The JP Lizzy website lists both the blue and pink for $98. The bag is so cute and can fit a lot of stuff. But I had to exchange the first one I ordered due to defective snaps. They're tough to snap and unsnap. A new bag came, and that one was also defective. Same issue with the snaps, plus the polka dots were double printed on one side of the interior. So I returned it. Total bummer b/c it looks so cute. It's just made from cheap material and hardware. Great customer service though."
4,QQ,"I like the fact that a diverse group of famous people are included in the book, as well as quotes that are not easily identifiable."
4,One of best films ever made.,"I think that this is one of the best films about Hitler's final days as the leader of Germany. The film depicts the last few weeks of Hitler's life, how the Russians were advancing on Hitler's bunker and how the high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party and the large number of military officers that were down there planned their escape from Berlin. The film was suspenseful and exciting. It kept me entertained. It wasn't depressing at all. The cast in this film gave great performances especially the portrayal of Hitler. I think that this a really great film. It's really worth watching."
3,"Good idea, Poor execution...no pun intended.","Alec Guinness' portrayal of Hitler was a lot more nuanced than Anthony Hopkins', but I still found it odd. His Hitler seemed strangely amused, more than anything else, as his entire world crumbled around him. (I guess he was just keeping a stiff British upper lip.) Like with the other pre-Untergang movies, you have the impression that the writers had a checklist of Bunker events they needed to provide dialogue for, and the director threw these scenes together with no regard for cohesion, tension or drama. The supporting cast was better than ""The Bunker"", but the movie was interrupted several times by Holocaust indoctrination segments, and the writers made this movie ridiculous by inserting a pre-suicide quarrel between Adolf and Eva. Buy ""Downfall""; this movie is a mere curiosity."
2,Outdated and Lacking in Subtlety,"Burdened by old film clips that we've seen millions of times in the past, as well as by stereoptyped portrayals of Hitler and his companions. Hence the viewing experience is essential boring and unexciting, despite the explosiveness of the content. Updated versions of this apocalyptic period give much better and more nuanced portrayals. For example--""Downfall""-- if you can tolerate subtitles."
3,A Turkey But Fun To Watch,"Questionable historical accuracy, actors unsuited for the parts (who chose these people?)and overacting galore--but still a movie to watch for these very reasons. Alec Guinness did his best but IMO went over the top, even for a fanatical Hitler. At times almost comical to watch, even given the subject matter. Still, it has its moments and is definitely recommended for anyone interested in the final days of the Nazi leader. Just don't expect a well-acted and accurate portrayal and you won't be disappointed. Very entertaining in its own way despite its faults and B movie aura."
5,Very Good,It is a very nice and powerful piece of hardware.I believe that Harman Kardon are the best equipment of audio in the whole world.I will buy it again.
4,A Feast for the Mind and the Senses,"Notes from the Wild is a CD/book that proves to be fascinating reading as well as compelling listening. Yes, I know that you think I have flipped my lid by recommending nature recordings, but if you value good sound, you enjoy reading books that are entertaining and intellectually stimulating, and you have always wondered what a desert or jungle might really sound like, this is the purchase for you, my friend. I have heard nature recordings that really left me cold, but this one is utterly compelling. To be able to read Bernie Krause's explanations about how, where, and why he made these recordings multiplies the pleasure. This is a truly sumptuous recorded and written feast for the mind and the senses."
4,Star First Novel,"Dr. Mason's novel is as beautiful as his poetry. (Which, if you have not, you should most certainly read!) He manages to create imagery that is jarring and fluid; surreal and tangible--all without feeling paradoxical or false to the reader. His larger-than-life characters never seem out of place in the haunting prairie home he creates for them. Deftfully using humor, magic realism, and a unique prose-poetry style, Dr. Mason's first novel does not disappoint. Further, his ability to personify all aspects of human emotion is unmatched. I sincerely look forward to reading his next novel."
4,A book searching for answers to life,"""Binary Star"" by Clif Mason is an intriguing story filled with vivid descriptions of the everyday life and the mysteries surrounding ""twins"". A story in search of the meaning of life.A wonderful effort by Cliff Mason!"
1,giving this piece of junk is way way too generous,"ok, so i learned a valuable thing today. ALWAYS READ THE CONSUMER REPORTS!!! My dvd player arrived two days ago. it's such a piece of junk. i put in the dvd and it played for about 9 seconds, then the screen went green and pixelated. i tried a few more times, then the tray wouldn't even open so that i could put the dvd in again. i should have listened to ""sleeping dragon"". please, for the love of all that is holy, do not buy this horrible horrible disappointment of technology."
5,A Must Read,Dave has done a great job with this book. The principles and disciplines he has outlined are a must read for any business owner interested in staying in business. There are points in this book that I felt were directly written towards me. It certainly gets you focused on the importance of making sure your management and sales staff are all on the same page.
3,"Solid premise, but weak and problematic writing","I would have given this book 5 stars because the premise is sound I agree with the problem and general solutions Mr. Anderson presents. However, I found the text to be problematic in 3 areas: a) Despite his disclaimers to the contrary, the book devolves into a very angry tone as the chapters progress; b) the use of crude and borderline-vulgar colloquialisms is off-putting; and c) the author begins repeating his points about 1/3 of the way into the book.The use of venom never sold many goods or convinced many people of a specific point of view. While I'm not recommending that Mr. Anderson make an anti-PC book politically correct, the issues I raise above are problematic for enough people that perhaps it will delay or prevent them from taking postiive action on the problems presented."
5,It's about time...,"It's about time somebody wrote a book like this. So called ""political correctness"" may have worked it's way into politics, academia and news coverage, but there is absolutely no place for it in your business.Dave Anderson gives clear, concise examples of how this insideous disease has infiltrated businesses...and how to remove it from and keep it out of yours.Reading this book will give you the wisdom to see what's wrong, and the courage to do what's right.Michael RoscoePresidentHorizon Communications, Inc."
5,Don't judge a book by its cover,"If you are going to review Lyn, you can't get too sentimental or misty-eyed--it just doesn't fit. No one can cut to the chase, or bottom-line it like Lyn. In fact, she scared the *&%#@ out of me a few times and I don't even work for her!However, I always thought that she is tough, but fair.And if you get out of the meeting room, and share a meal or a drink, Lyn's got a big smile and a bigger laugh.Lyn, Good luck in this next phase of your life. I'm sure you will bring all your talents, energy and enthusiasm to whatever you do.Best,Alison Lazarus"
1,should be zero stars,"This was the worst spent money on a cd ...EVER! As a Rush fan for many (30) years , this is an abomination of their music. It would have been a little better if there was no percussion ....this guy was horrible. The drumming sounds like a junior high snare drummer that knows one little ratta-tat-tat and plays the same thing on every song. The terrible tone and playng of this drummer sounds like popcorn popping in the background. The group as a whole are just not a tight group. This sounds like a practice session that got recorded while the annoying fiddlesticker was doodling. This bunch obviosly understands nothing about dynamics. You will be listening along and then there is an abrupt stop.....now here comes a disjointed pipe organ solo that doesn't sound like the same song. This happens several times in different songs. I can't even listen to this..sheer torture. This is an abuse of the fans of Rush and yes, this is a severe review. I fell like my money was stolen on this one."
4,Hard to find jewel,"I am thrilled with my ""Christmas with Rosamund Piltcher"" book. Slightly worn but overall very good condition. I plan to visit Scotland in May and visit the area where this author not only lives, but used as the setting for ""Winter Solstice"" my all time favorite book."
3,"Back to the basics, simple production as an exploration","In EME, Jon has joined his musical talents and dreams with his new love, Jane. Here they explore a musical presentation of simple production and style, combining Jon's unique voice and joy with elements of nature. The simplicity comes through in the music, yet unfortunately also in the recording (which could use a little help). But the music and emotions are very Jon.My personal favorite, the title song ""Earth Mother Earth"" has some incredible lyrics evoking our spiritual connection with nature. One of the best songs for ""simply"" experiencing Jon's message."
3,Disappointing,"I'd long wanted to hear Jon Anderson do an acoustic album, one free of the complexities of Yes, and the keyboards of Vangelis. So when I came across this CD I was pretty exited, but after listening to it several times I found it to be pretty dissapointing. While there are a couple of good songs,there's also a lot of filler material that just don't hold up to repeated listening."
1,!qué sosería!,"Yes es el máximo ejemplo de grupo en el cual ""el todo es mucho más que la suma de las partes"". Salvo algún disco de Steve Howe y el Fish out of Water de Squire, todos los demás están a años luz no de la estética (que es lo de menos) sino de la calidad de los de Yes. Los de Jon Aderson son ejemplos palmarios de ésto. Cada uno de ellos tiene una orientación muy distinta pero todos tienen en común algo: son malísimos. Si exceptuamos el primero que, a pesar de las buenas críticas, es bastante soso aunque pasable, los demás rozan el ridículo. Patético, melífluo, aburrido, dulzón, etc. son adjetivos que se pueden aplicar a todos sus discos. Este no es una excepción. En este caso le toca el turno a la vena ecológico-naturista. Un conjunto de canciones con ruidos de pajarítos y demás efectos campestres para un olvidable ¿esfuerzo?. El disco sigue la máxima de ""como conseguir un dinerillo sin despeinarme""."
5,FUN!,"my family LOVES this game..... it is easy to learn, easy to play, easy to transport, easy to get carried away and take the BIG gamble and lose all your points.......we are a game family and we play this one often......."
5,"Fun, portable, surprisingly engaging & strategic!","I played Toss Up at a ""game day"" in the clubhouse of my townhouse complex. An elementary school-aged girl taught it to us (3 adults and 1 elementary school-aged boy). At first I thought it might be too simple, seeing as a kid could explain it, and I also thought it might be boring. I was WRONG! :) It was very fun and very engaging! Plus it involves more strategy than you might think! At times it made me think of those game shows where you have to decide if you want to keep the points/money you have, or risk it all for (possibly) MORE points/money. At least with Toss Up, you can afford to take chances! *chuckle* Some of us were more conservative than others, though. Everyone had a great time, and the 2 kids and 3 adults were on a pretty equal playing field. We ALL would recommend this game!! It's super-portable too! :)"
4,Toss Up/ game,"Our grandson (7) received this for Christmas. He had played it at his school and loved the game. It does help them with numbers, counting, and keeping score. Was fun for his sister (9) and we as grandparents, as well. Very small game, handy for travel and taking to a friend's house. Keep away from babies and toddlers...pieces are cubes the size of dice."
5,Great for all ages!,"I was taught this game by a fellow counselor at a camp. It's a great game that has fun value, as well as educational value.It's one of the easiest games to learn, and I even taught my 6 year old niece how to play. She loved it.Toss Up is a good game to teach kids about probability and risk, as well as decision making. Basically, you roll 10 dice, then the green dice score. If you don't have any greens, the only way you can continue is if there aren't any reds. You stop when you want and write down your score, unless you want to take a chance on your next toss. I recommend this game for ages 5 and up. For children with small hands, I'd recommend using a cup for them to toss the dice out of."
4,Fun for all ages,This is a quick and easy game for all ages. It keeps kids busy and is fun to play when you don't have much time to set up other games. If is nice for grown ups who don't like card games and want something else to do.
3,Toss up,"A nice little game, I got it to play with grand children, as when they are little they can still count their own score. and it makes them feel a part of the game. teaches them about turn taking."
1,garbage from alpha to omega,"This is garbage from the start to the finish of this mockery of album. What happened to the u-god on the wu tang albums? all the lyrics are weak, the hooks suck, and the beats are weak also. That is a very dangerous combination. This album is so bad I almost want to recommend that u-god stops rapping. This album displays how weak he is (on the solo tip) and how much he needs the rest of the wu to help him pick a good beat and produce some decent lyrics. U-god should never stray too far away from his clan."
5,"""Outstanding!! burting with energy!","""Outstanding!! He can purr and he can growl...bursting with energy...pretty broad player. Haslanger is clearly in the forefront of the young new, fresh players. He has respect fortradition as well as being himself. He is a merger of the past and the future.""--Herb Wong, JazzTimes writer"
3,Reconditioned TV,Color is a little off. TV makes popping noises even when unplugged while cooling down.
3,An interesting essay on the Part of Fortune,"Martin Schulman states that the Part of Fortune indicates where in the chart we can find our greatest expression and joy. He delineates the Part of Fortune in the signs and Houses. The book is brief -- a little over 100 pages. It is well written and makes interesting observations. Unfortunately, several of his example charts are based on inaccurate birth data (at least when compared to the data in AstroDataBank), which makes one wonder about the validity of his observations."
3,Needs more in aspect explanations,"I was looking for more explanation of individual aspects and transists to and from the part of fortune, which weren't included."
1,Worth Every Penny You'll Pay for It,"As excited as I was to see that this is free on Kindle, I quickly found out why- It's useless. Unfortunately, the grid that is the key to the ""game"" is not translated correctly, so it renders as a useless row of hashes. My boyfriend points out that there is an app on the computer that I can use for the grids and problems, but at that point why would I bother with the Kindle?"
1,A truly woeful edition of a truly wonderful text,"One of the great injustices of the literary world is that two-bit publishers can take out-of-copyright texts, turn them into inadequate cheap on-demand books, disappoint customers enough to warrant one-star reviews and create the impression that such negative comments are a reflection on the text.I read the reviews about how poor the Kindle edition was, so decided to buy the print version instead. A humble flick through the book reveals that Carroll's diagrams (rather integral to explaining how to solve the riddles) are pieces of ASCII art that is poorly aligned, and thereby nonsensical and, effectively, useless.To anyone who wants to experience Carroll's game, in a format that shows great care for the text AND does not make profit for hack publishers, I suggest you check out Project Gutenberg's free options at [...]"
1,rip off,"For over an hour, self-proclaim specialists of ""pink-floyd"" explain key by key the note played on instruments by different band's members...absoloutly boaring and no comments on all the dvd by the real members.About 5 millions miles away from the making of ""the dark side of the moon"" wich is a rare insight of this band with past and present footage of Waters, Gilmoore,Right and Mason. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REAL (LONG TIME) FANS OR CURIOUS CATS !"
1,rip off,"I have purchace the DVD yesturday for 35 $ Canadian and it is absolutly not worth it.Contains no vidéo of pink floyd, Cannot read cretics on the TV, caraters with shadow makes it really hard to read, no book in the casse, DVD is only 58 min. The only extra il a remake of Cunfortably Numb by an unknown band.( Remake is not that bad but i was expecting way more from this DVD ) At first this was suppose to be a double DVD set, but it as been split for america it is really no worth this amount. ( The cover says 2nd edition but the DVD says third edition.....) Really low budget."
4,Beautifully written. Very sad.,"I enjoyed this book but found it very depressing. It is the story of a woman who is dying of cancer and recounts her life. She was abandoned by her mother at 14. She and her brother were also abandoned by their father after that and left to their own devices. She is date raped, has an affair with a teacher and is raped again by 2 boys from school. The upide of the story is how much she is supported and loved by her older brother and best friend. Don't look here for a fairy tale ending. Just enjoy the beautiful writing style and touching story."
4,"Sad, but great story","I agree with the other reviews, this book is beautifully written. I thought that this read would be really sad, but even though the main character had many sad life experiences, it was still a great story about coming to terms with what was and realizing what you had the whole time."
3,Living in the Past,"At age thirty Piper Kincaid is dying of breast cancer. This is the end of what has hardly been an easy life. When Piper was a teenager her artist mother ran away, her spirit crushed by the burdens of poverty and motherhood. I expected that this would be a book about coming to terms with death, but it is actually a book about coming to terms with the loss of a mother. The year that Piper's mother left Piper finds herself drawn into a relationship with one of her male teachers. Piper's brother is committed to putting a stop to what is decidedly an inappropriate relationship, though Piper clings to it, feeling that she has lost so much else.I found this book to be rather difficult to get through, and I expected to like it more than I did. The subject matter sounded like something that would appeal to me, but the execution didn't match my expectations. I simply could not get invested in the characters and their web of decidedly vast problems."
5,Quite vivid in its portrayal of a war-torn America,"Set in 1862 during the American Civil War, The Boys from Kalamazoo by t. J. Johnston is a fictional account of the famous Kalamazoo Sharpshooters. Lending a vibrant freshness to a yesteryear world of American history peopled with the heroes, villains, ordinary soldiers, and citizenry who fought and died in the toils and turmoils of a bloody civil war, The Boys From Kalamazoo is entertaining, thoughtful, thought-provoking, and quite vivid in its portrayal of a war-torn America."
5,Time will tell,"If a CD could get dog-eared, than all my Chuck Brodsky recordings would be looking kind of ragged by now. His writing isn't flashy, his voice doesn't sound like it's trying out for an olympic team, no need. Chuck writes the type of songs that speak simply, ring true, and weather well. I recommend any and all of his recordings. Chuck Brosky CD's are like instant old friends."
4,Not Ba-a-a-a-a-d!,"Fast moving, well acted and entertaining dark comedy. Tastefully done, except for the somewhat explicit man-on-sheep action. If you like the offbeat and you aren't put off by the concept of zoophilia, you will likely enjoy it."
2,"no customer service, no adapter","I just bought this and 1. it did not come with an adapter for in-home use nor did it come with a car adapter. Its a neat little tv, but - when I tried to call to ORDER the adapters - the number is ""no longer active"". So what does that tell you? It tells you that - do not buy this product. It costs too much, and they can't even supply an adapter! and 2. There is NO customer service to order more supplies, ask about warranty, return the defective product or ask general inquiries. I gave it two stars for its quality, but dropped the two stars for horrible customer service and no adapter."
1,Much less than expected!,This TV is not very sensitive and does not pick up stations very well. The unit does not work with an external power source and must be repaired which is an additional shipping cost. The bottom line: Another expensive useless piece of junk!
2,A Different Kind of Review,"This review is different in the respect that it addresses what is NOT on the Soundtrack.Rent the movie again, and listen to the song playing when Michelle Pfeiffer's character, Angela first arrives in the city with her son. The song playing is WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD, by Jane Child. The self-titled CD, Jane Child, was actually released a year after this movie was made.Nonetheless, my point is that ""Welcome to the Real World"" should have made it onto the soundtrack. There, I've said it--- I feel better now."
2,TRACK BY TRACK...,"track listings1.A ZILLION KISSES-this one is good but there is a better extended version included in his ""TIME"" album.2.TURNING ME ON-Sounds OK.3.AFRICAN SUNSET-Skip4.I THINK IM IN LOVE-Fair enough5.HARD TO BE NORMAL-Skip6.I LOVE LONDON-Skip7.MAKING MY MOVE-Skip8.LOVE TAKES OVER-Sounds OK9.A SHOULDER TO CRY ON-The only song why i need to buy this cd.10.MINNETA LANE- SkipI like tommy page but i cant help myself giving this cd a two star rating.i have to be honest, if u got his song ""a shoulder to cry on ""on a compilation cd dont bother to buy this one unless u are up to the lyrics and pictures on the sleeve of this album."
4,The Male Madonna,"Tommy Page, who would later be known for his #1 hit single ""I'll Be Your Everything"", first started his career with this self-titled debut album. The album featured mostly upbeat dance oriented songs which fell somewhere along the lines of Madonna, Expose', and maybe Debbie Gibson. For the most part, it worked well. The album featured many club favorites including the singles ""A Zillion Kisses"" and ""Turning Me On"", and album tracks such as the Madonna-esque ""African Sunset"", ""Making My Move"", and ""Love Takes Over""; but suprisingly enough, the highlights of the album fall in the two ballads ""I Think I'm In Love"", and Tommy's first big hit ""A Shoulder To Cry On"". It was no suprise then that his follow up album would cater more to the ballads and less to the dance oriented pop featured on this album."
4,Tommy Page's Debut,"Before Tommy Page repackaged himself as a pop teen idol, he released his self-titled album in 1988. Discovered by the same man who found Madonna, Tommy Page didn't seem to fit into a specific categorization at first. His songs were high-energy pop, blended with mild techno rhythms, but never to the point that they sounded like disco. Instead, he was concentrated on a stylized musical pattern, for which he collaborated with artists like Arif Mardin (Bette Midler's longtime producer, and L.Russel Brown, who wrote for Leslie Gore in the 60s). The album will be a surprise for those who know him for his later efforts- but it is consistent and enjoyable. The highlights include ""I Think I'm in Love"" and the remarkable, beautiful ""A Shoulder to Cry On"" which may not be the song that shot him to success in America, but is every bit as worthy."
2,Great photos - but unreliable,"This camera takes great photos and is very easy to use. I would have given it 4 stars, except the flash stopped popping up when it was just about 1 year old - that's too soon for a camera this expensive to break. This camera was never dropped or abused, it was always treated with kid gloves. I suggest checking online for other peoples' experiences with the reliability and repair costs for this camera before purchasing."
1,Can't focus,"I purchased this camera but decided to return it. It is very easy to use, USB 2.0 makes downloads fast. The cradle works well and the ability to view the camera's filesystem as an external disk is handy as well. The camera looks good and it feels solid. Good piece of engineering. There's only one fundamental issue with the camera - it can't focus. Roughly 25% of pictures I took were blurry for no apparent reason. I emailed Fuji to get updated firmware, but was asked to call them and did not have the time to hang on the phone with customer support. I used an old Canon S20 before and never had similar issues. It's really too bad since except the image quality, everything else in this camera is close to perfect. But then again, why does one purchase a camera if not for good photos ?"
5,Simply the best cd I have heard in 2005!,"I heard about this band through friends and the video magazine called Props. Although I heard about the band inly just this past week and purchased the cd, it has not left my cd player yet. It always seems the best bands always breakup before you find them. This criminally overlooked band came and went too soon. Given the right amount of financial backing, booking support, and representation, B2F could have easily been today's Fall Out Boy. There are two other cd's that they have put out since. Although they are not listed here in Amazon, I heard they are still available on their old label's site www.crustaceanrecords.com. It is completely worth your time to spend the minute or two it takes to hunt the releases from this band. I promise you, they were a diamond in the rough!"
5,Production Gun,"For Production framing, this is the gun. It takes abuse like no other. It's fast and shoots hard. On top of being a solid gun, the nails are cheaper (in our part of the country). If you provide nails on the job, you know what a difference that can make. Yes, they do jam. Easy enough to clear though. On the last house alone (10,100 sq ft), we had guns that fired over 50,000 nails each. Considering the use, the jams are minimal. This is the gun for Pros."
5,SHEER BRILLIANCE FROM A-HA!,"A-ha is one of the great bands of our time. The album, STAY ON THESE ROADS, is definalely their finest work to date. The music transcends the boring, ever so common keyboard re-hash that many people expect from A-ha. A stereotype placed on them, mistakenly! There is a sense of bliss in this music. The production is tight, the writing is brilliant, and Morton Harket is the closest thing to perfect that a singer can be. A tremendous overall production and an album that lovers of many genres of music will like. Do not miss this one!!!"
1,Undercooked A-Ha,"This is the only effort by the Scandinavian crew that I came away from with a bad taste in my mouth. The album has the feel of a collection of earlier songs that were passed up for publication. This is the type of half hearted effort that comes about when a group or artist feels pressured to release a new album. The only bright spots are ""Hurry Home"" and ""Stay On These Roads"". Not enough . Bring on the raspberry jam guys."
3,Has some good moments.,"This third album from A-ha is not too bad. Best songs are ""The Blood That Moves the Body"" and ""The Living Daylights."" The rest of them are okay. ""Out of Blue Comes Green"" is overlong though. I prefer Hunting High and Low, but Stay on These Roads is pretty good."
1,threw them away,"Oh well, money wasted. Might work on fine hair, but sure didn't do a thing for me! Would NOT recommend. Will stick to more traditional methods..."
2,OKish product.,"I have read many good reviews about this product but to be honest, I was disappointed. I have not reordered it since. It takes too much effort to remove the hair in my leg. But on my face, I felt it is too harsh."
1,doesn't work at all,"this is a waste of money! it doesn't pick a single hair of you face! it irritates the skin on your face, and leave all the hair in place.. go for a waxing or buy a hair off cream or smething else, this doesn't work at all."
1,Do not buy this product?,"This does not do anything like what is claimed. It just hurts your skin and does not get rid of the hair at all. I have very tiny and light hair on my upper lip, yet it did not get all the hair out and I ended up with a sore lip with rashes for two days. I would not recommend this product."
4,Very thought provoking!,"Read this book thoughtfully, and then went back and read it over again with even more direction and focus. It clarified for me what the role of ""religion"" is/should be in my life, and what steps I can take to live a fuller life in Jesus Christ."
5,Harman/Kardon AVR-125,"Great Reciever, has great sound quality, Totally Digital Controls, i have considered JVC, Onkyo, and Technics, But this sounded the BEST out of the bunch, has Harman/Kardon's EXCLUSIVE LOGIC-7, makes it sound like you have 7 speakers. Very high qualiy, and well built, and great sound quality."
5,LOVE THIS GUM!!!! Why is it no longer available????,"I am a personal trainer and I recommend this gum to my clients as a natural decongestant during their training. No more dorky nasal strips for runners, cyclists, or triathletes. This gum is all you need! It does not cause a slimy mouth while exercising and the natural peppermint lasts for a half marathon and then some! AND, it is sugar free, which is what most athletes want, and trainers recommend. Sugared mint gum only makes you more thirsty!!Too bad that the makers of Altoids do not see fit to continue offering it. This flavor is the BEST for exercising. I hope they reconsider and begin making the peppermint available again!!"
5,Love that Altoid Gum!,"We enjoy the Altoid gum not only for it's obvious minty and breath freshening flavor. My husband does a lot of driving and he finds that the big hit of flavor and pleasing crunch of the coating helps keep him alert and refreshed. We also find that because of the strong mint, it also sometimes soothes a troubled tummy. Plus it's not a giant wad of gum in your mouth. We've grown quite attached to that tasty little pebble."
5,great product,"Altoids Peppermint gum is an excellent product; I have not been able to find it in my area,so this purchase was great. The cost was a little more than I had previously paid, but worth the price to get my favorite gum again."
3,These are pretty good except I have three problems...,"1.) the flavor is very strong at the beginning but it doesn't last.2.) since they come in a little can, you don't have an individual wrapper to toss into your pocket/purse to use later to dispose of the gum.3.) they aren't asparatame free.But they do have a great flavor (too strong for anybody I've offered it to though!) and I do like the little can. You can use that for other things like my mom gave one to her aunt for her pills. Don't worry, she's not around children hardly ever, so I doubt that any kind of mistake would ever happen, like a child mistaking her pill canister for candy.But DO take caution yourself about what you hide in it and where you store it! ;)"
5,altoid chewing gum perks my taste buds,"My wife and I enjoy Altoid peppermint chewing gum daily. The strength will not last all day. However, they are a very tasteful product with a burst of flavor in every chew.My purchase of the Altoid product, thru Amazon, saved me about $.75 a tin. The shipping costs were very minimal. The product was fresh and arrived at my home in excellent condition!Give Altoids a try."
5,"The Only Joy In My Life Is Dead, I Am Dead",I know why you're here. No you can't buy it anymore. We chewed it all. It's gone forever. I die.
3,Are you living your dream?,The book is very mind-boggling. It gives you an insight of whats out there beyond a job. Great book for beginners of the real world.
4,Interesting Book,"Wolf writes interesting comparative evaluations of historical personages in both volumes of this little pair of books. His comparisons are useful, not profound in any way, but short biographies which point out characteristics of the historical figures as well as similarities and differences between them. The chapters are clearly written, almost too simply,and should certainly give students no problem whatsoever.You will note that I am commenting on the actual book itself -- and not the price my college bookstore charged me for it. Presumbably, the troubled soul who could not see beyond the price his college bookstore charged, was later able to sell it back to the bookstore. Shouldn't he have mentioned that? Probably forgot. Did he even read it? We'll never know. Probably forgot."
1,What a rip-off!!!,"What a rip-off! If you buy this piece of over priced toilet paper, you will definitely be sorry. It's 1/3rd of an inch thick and has a little over 200 pages. And guess how much they charge for it new??? 40$!!!! I got mine USED for 18$, but still. I could buy the 7th Harry Potter book with a hard cover which is at least 2 1/2 inches thick cheaper than this over priced piece of kindling. It's just another example of how companies are exploiting poor college kids to make their stock's value jump up a few extra cents."
2,shipping weight 10lb???,i almost got this one but things not add up. the shipping weight is 10 lbs. I have taken mine off my car its more like 1-2 and the statement about core item and extra cost and you have to pay to ship it back. no thanks.
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT BY GENE WOLFE,"Unless Colin Kapp is a pseudonym, this entry is incorrect. The book I received is by Kapp, and contains an advertisement for a book by Gene Wolfe called Operation Ares. Needless to say, I was not happy to see that the Amazon.com entry was wrong. Thanks for nothing Amazon!"
1,Not worth the $$$,This book was not at all what I was expecting. Only order this if you want to pay almost $70.00 dollars for about 15 pictures of the Simpsons with Kaws faces. Terrible.
5,Exquisitely Erotic,"The aroma and beauty really and truly sends me into a wonderful passionate feeling for myself (feeling superbly wonderful). Whoever comes within my close proximity and exposed to its fragrance will experience this sense of the mystery of love and loving something. I used this years ago, stopped, and wonderfully using it again. Also, not to mention, I got a very, very, good deal. Signed up for the Amazon Chase card, gave me a $30 discount and free shipping ... total cost, $19.99 ... retail $45 or more. That's a big ""WOW"". I was not a Amazon shopper, bought only once before and it was positive, but after this great deal, I am here to stay. Thank you Amazon, I am a very happy camper...I'll be back....... LOL !!!"
5,A challanging critique,"As we watch Rita become educated, we are able to see the effects of education on both Frank and Rita. In a world that idolizes education as the ultimate means to improving quality of life and as a benchmark of success, the play is a challenging question about the true worth and effects of education, especially institutional education. I highly recommend this for anyone who's ever asked whether a graduate degree would truly be a good idea."
1,Sticking zipper - difficult for this to be useful,The item I received had a zipper that was very awkward to open or close. The tab on the zipper broke off before I had put earphones in for the first time. Others' experience may vary but I found this product to be relatively useless. I can't see using it away from home to store earphones and fighting with the zipper each time it is opened or closed. Buyer beware.
3,"Works, but not really made for iPhone earbuds","This case does protect my iPhone earbuds, and is a fairly handy case to carry around. But, it's fairly difficult to wrap iPhone earbuds, in particular, around the inner workings. The volume buttons on the line makes it a bit difficult. It suffices for what I needed, but I think consideration could have been made for the volume buttons. You also have to be careful to not catch the audio line with the zipper."
4,Tiny,"This is a great product for keeping small sized earphones such as those for an iPod/iPhone or earbuds. It will not take anything larger tho. This is a nice compact case, but it is a tad difficult to wrap the cord around inside and get the plug to fit snugly. I think that after some trial and error I may figure out how to better pack my earphones, but all-in-all, I love this tiny case!"
4,Fits iPhone buds great!,"These work great to keep your iPhone earbuds safe, they fit in the case perfectly! The only gripe I had about the product is it's quite pricey for this size of accessory but it is in a class of it's own."
2,"Meh. Good looking, but incredibly difficult to use.","This is a nice looking case, but it's way too small for the earbuds, unless you feel like painstakingly wrapping your cords into a tiny little compartment and then frantically trying to unwrap them (not easily) when someone calls five times a day. In fact, it was such a pain to use that I broke down and got a bluetooth headset for calls, and I just carry this (admittedly stylish and tough) case with my earbuds in it for listening to music. So, if you are looking for storage for earbuds that are only used intermittently, then by all means, buy this product. If you use your headset on a regular basis and want to put it in and out of the case several times a day, this will have you gnashing your teeth in no time.PS that favorable review is so fake."
5,Great headset.,Very nice item. Exactly what I was looking for. Something portable and easy to put away. Sound quality is good but if you're to purchase this item you're not looking for the best listening quality.
4,Wonderful novel,"I loved how easily this story flowed. It is set during the Depression era and centres on two sisters, Clara and Nora Callan. Clara is the wall-flower who stays in the hometown she grew up in and leads what she feels is a fairly conservative lifestyle. Her life is revealed to us in journal entries and letters to her sister Nora. A horrible event shakes up her life in ways she never knew possible and eventually leads her down roads she felt she would never trod upon.Her sister Nora is leading the glamorous life and becomes very much a socialite in her circles. Her correspondence with her sister shows us that all is not how it appears in her life either.This book was a pure pleasure to read. The ability to find extraordinary in the ordinary and often mundane things in life shows the true talent of this author. I felt a connection to Clara Callan and was sad to see the story end."
2,"Disappointing, appearing to go somewhere, but never arrives","Light and fluffy with no real content except discontent and the exercise of bad judgement. The first half of the book hints at the possibility of some deepness in the second half, but disappoints in that respect. The ""Afterward"" gives the appearance of the story being non-fiction, but unless the author is using a male pseudonym, that would be impossible.If you want to follow the meaningless lives of two sisters and wallow in the elder's loneliness, peccadilloes, and bad judgements then this is a book for you. The older sister of the first half of the book has so much potential which is fully destroyed by the author in the second half."
4,Beautifully written,"A well-researched, well-written novel. Brings you right inside the time period, before the Second WW. I enjoyed the sister's relationship. It was realistic and beautiful."
1,Not a very intellectual read,"This book, although it has somehow managed to receive rave reviews, is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The lack of intelligent issues and/or depth of thought is astounding. Wright's use of the female voice as well as his attempt to go back to the year 1945 while keeping the thoughtful reader even vaguely interested has failed. Were Wright to have written from his own patriarchal, present-day perspective, his attempt at writing an engaging, intelligent novel would most likely have been more successful. For those who enjoy shallow, easy-to-follow books, this one is for you! Otherwise, read something by Timothy Findley (if you want an engaging Canadian author)!"
5,This CD Grows on You,"I bought this CD mainly because of 2 songs. It's become my favorite. I love both CDs. The Dream CD is an appropriate title with beautiful hauntingly,rich music. The Joy CD also appropriately titled and is filled with upbeat songs and great to dance to."
5,Royalty at its best.......,"King Henry the Second releashes his jailed wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, for the Xmas holidays. The two come together with their three sons, the King's mistress and her brother, Philip of France, to discuss the succession to the throne, the marriage of the mistress to the King's successor and the annexation of a rich French province to the English Crown. The thrill of the play is entirely in the words - marvellous in their scope and cutting in their execution. Scenes of sex or violence would have been superfluous - the verbal assassinations, particularly between the King and his estranged queen, take you to the grit of life itself. Do yourself a favour and rent the video - Katherine Hepburn and Peter O""Toole, and a very young Anthony Hopkins as the sexually confused Richard the Lion Heart, make for incredibly fine viewing. My all-time favourite play."
4,"Good CD, but hard to find","It took a while for me to track down this CD. I heard Calhoun on the radio a few months back (River City Folk perhaps?) and instantly went out a found everything I could by him. What impressed me is that he seems be be getting better with every new release.His latest (Tiger Tatoo) blew away everything else he's done. Thank goodness there are still some radio stations out there that play good music from lesser known artist, or I never would have found out about this guy."
5,Great CD!,"Well I have to say I love this album. This guy has a great voice and a unique style. It's kind of like folk music, but its not about Puff The Magic Dragon or Give Peace A Chance. It's more just about life, good and bad. Good stuff."
1,This is my most favorite cd of all times!!,there is just something about this c d that really gets to me. I take it where ever I go.Of all Jarreau's work this is my most favorite. The songs are so sexy and exciting except for YO JEANS which I really do not like at all. It doesn't seem to go with the rest but I can live with it. Go Al!! You are the greatest!!!
5,"Heart's Horizon...under the radar but a true ""keeper""","Al Jarreau is an amazing jazz vocalist, and ""Heart's Horizon"" is my personal favorite. I first bought it on cassette tape (back in the 90s!) and just wo' it out; had to buy it again on CD, liner notes and all. The songs are funky/sexy, romantic, compelling...Once, on a road trip several years ago, I played the tape nonstop while driving up the Pacific Coast Highway towards a fateful encounter with the man who turned out to be my soul mate; songs like ""One Way"", ""All or Nothing at All"", ""So Good""--even the painful reflections of ""More Love"" and ""Pleasure over Pain""--helped set the mood for new beginnings and happy endings. We should've invited Al to the wedding.It's all there--thoughtful lyrics, great arrangements, well-chosen vocalists. Enjoy!"
5,They are socks people....,"When I read the reviews before purchasing these socks, I was a little surprised of the enthusiasm I read about a pair of socks... BUT, they are awesome socks. My husband is a lineman, working on powerlines he doesn't have time to worry about his socks. These are great and I will be buying more."
5,Actually Over-The-Calf!,"I wear a size 12 shoe so many over-the-calf socks ""come up short"" so to speak. These are truely over-the-calf, heavy-weight cotton quality socks. I would not hesitate to buy these again."
4,Gold Toe over the calf socks,"These socks are my husbands favorite, he is a firefighter and wears boots and the socks stay up with out repeat pulling."
4,These are the socks I always buy,"I have tried a number of different socks. But these always seems to be the most comfortable and last the longest. So, I believe that they are a great value for your money."
3,nice socks,I wear these in high rubber boots at a food plant. I like them a lot. They are sooper tall go over my calf and then some - I have to fold them down. they do keep the boot from rubbing on my legs though and that was the plan.
2,socks,A little too big for me. When I ordered Over the Calf I thought they would be about Calf high.. or just over ..Not going up to about just below my knees...
4,much better,these seem to launder like the traditional short socks. gold toes hold up just not happy with the wool version.
4,Great purchase,"Overall, I was happy with the purchase I was not pleased that I had to go to the post office to retrieve the package."
2,Poor Quality,"Maybe is was the supplier but these socks are not what you expect from Gold Toe and my experience was different from 70+ other reviewers. The elastic will not keep the socks up and the weave in the sock shaft seperated on the first pair when putting on for the first time. Will not reorder and makes me hesitant to purchase Gold Toe in the future. Update - December 30, 2012. The seller responded to my complaint with an adjustment and a comment that they were surprised at the quality problem since this was one of their best selling socks."
4,great game but very bad online play,this is an amazing game and I would recomend this to any fan of the series but their are to many bugs with the online play and that to me is what kills this game.
4,Great game!,"This game is a shoot 'em up covert spy game that is the new generation of spy games. This game was extremely difficult to figure out the controlls and weapons, but once you did, It was very Fun!"
5,Grows on you,"I love this brand of drumming, broadly defined as frame-drum, and generally of the Arabic world. I'm no musicologist conversant in the analysis of complex rhythm-izing, so I'll just assure you that you will love it as I do, if you have any sensitive foot-tapping in your body somewhere.This is one of those great sets of compositions that ferment in your ears, if you will, acculturating the soul to exotic textures and languages of beat and melody. It is one of the few CD's I have that I feel so at home with, and yet intrigued by, (relaxing yet stimulating, comforting yet provocative) that I can play it night after night as I go to sleep and traverse the drumming dreamworld.Also check out the video(s?) Velez has done -- even more fun to WATCH."
5,Outstanding recording,"An outstanding live recording from a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Moment Records (Zakir Hussain's own label). The two CD set contains 3 ragas with Ravi Shankar in his 74th year playing better than ever with Zakir Hussain, tabla, and a sarodist playing duets. CD #1 Contains two rags; Raga Jait & Kirwani; CD #2 contains one rag Misra Khamaj lasting 55 minutes. A total of almost 2 hours of superb Indian music. A must for a music lovers."
3,For the Ravi Shankar Collector...Not 1st Time Buyer,"I love Ravi Shankar. I don't completely love this recording. I feel that it lacks some of the emotional complexity I find in ALL of his other recordings. The moments that it has going for it, other recordings do better. For exciting, vibrant live sitar playing, I like ""Live at the Monterey Pop Festival."" For serious depth and contemplation, I like ""Sound of the Sitar."" This concert was a little too middle-of-the-road for my taste. He doesn't seem to be reaching for something quite as hard as in other recordings. I will admit that I tend to prefer his earlier releases (when he was younger.) Perhaps the changes in style I detect are a function of maturity (that I haven't quite grasped yet.) I am still glad to have it in my collection, but would not recommend it as an introduction to Ravi Shankar's gifts."
4,Always Fly,This product is 100% one of the best inventions ever made. Although they didn't have this particular product in stock they sent me the next best thing. Wasn't too enthusiastic about that.
5,niceeeeeee,"light action triggers and no stupid rubber tip to obstruct your view of the work..also, a tip..if you shoot a brad and don't release the trigger right away you totally eliminate the punch mark in the wood...for perfectionists like me ,we like that lolboth are light weight tools and out of every brand i've used (all of them) these fit into tighter areas."
5,a urgent experience in Music !,"in addition to what other reviewers said very well, just a remark regarding another version in comparison :I have listened lately to the recordings of Alfred Brendel, it is so disappointing that i prefer no to play them anymore and consider Brendel as the fine Beethovenist that he can be.A simple example is the impromptu op. 90 number 4. The sense of emergency is so incredible in the version of Lupu. It is like it was the very last time he could express himself at the piano. The vivid intensity of every tone will touch you to tears. In comparison, it is barely the same composition with Brendel. I would not say it is boring, but it is flat, it lacks inspiration. Brendel tends to executes mechanically the sheet of music.Radu Lupu plays music in every instant. It is as simple as that.The comparison shows an abyss between the two approaches.Interesting though !"
5,Legendary Indeed,"While this Decca ""Legenary Performance"" was recorded in 1982, it still stands as a pinnacle of Shubert pianism. Every guide I see rates it highly. After recently listening again to this disc twice though, I was moved by the poetic sweep of the music and could not point to anything that seemed out-of-place or in need of refinement. Lupu's touch just sounds right - dare say perfect - for the music. Lendendary is a fitting description of this recording whose sound is much more modern than the 80-'s recording date. Be part of music history and delve into the poetic world of Shubert given to us by this marvelous pianist so attuned to Schubert's lyrical story telling. This one is easy: Compositions - 5 stars; Performance - 5 stars; Sound Quality - 4.5 stars."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a big fan (no pun intended) of Vornado air circulators. I own a couple of different models but this is the first time I'm not happy with the product. Although there's only a few parts to assemble, putting it together took a lot of effort because of poor design. Getting the parts to fit was so much harder than it should ever be. Secondly, when the fan is tilted at certain angles you can hear the blades slightly rubbing against the inside of the fan.Do yourself a favor, don't buy this model."
4,Good Product if a bit Overpriced,"I don't know what the previous reviewer's problem was, but if it took me 3 minutes to assemble this fan, I'd be surprised. That was after I had already lost the instructions, and I am notoriously ham handed when it comes to figuring out things mechanical. There is only one way to put it together.Having said that, make sure you are aware that this is a fairly small fan, and that the pedestal is fairly short, and doesn't adjust. It is cheaply made from molded plastic. No metal fram here. If that's what you want, then cool.It does seem to move a substantial amount of air.I got mine at a substantial discount (the model is discontinued), and my only regret is that I didn't get two when I had the chance."
4,Cheaper from manufacturer by $100!,"Why is this so expensive here? Great product, I bought mine elsewhere. I came here looking to buy another one and the price is $100 higher?"
1,What a waste,There is nothing in this book that you can't find on the web. The few maps that are included are not detailed enough to be of use.
4,Very thin material,Will need black out liners behind these. Thought they might be a little thicker material. Came all wrinkle too & hard to iron. Had to starch out the wrinkles.
3,Thin but adequate,"These are very pretty hanging in the nursery. They are a great addition baby's new room. They are very thin, however. So more for show than actual privacy or use in keeping a bit of light out."
3,nice but wouldn't order again,"This is nice, but very thin and if I knew how to sew, I could have done it myself. It looks nice hanging, but we had to put room darkening blinds because it is so thin. Probably would not order again for the price."
3,Like a yellowed newspaper clipping . . .,"I bought this CD when it was originally released in 1989 and listened to it a lot; one day I dropped it into the changer and the lyrics that had originally struck me as deadly earnest now sounded bloated and preachy. The music is great, with first-rate no-frills guitar/bass/drums, although the producer found it necessary to put Reed's voice so far out front that it sometimes drowns out the instrumentation; interesting decision, when you consider how limited Reed's voice is.On the other hand, you have to hear the lyrics. That's what this CD is about; Reed's seemingly off-the-top-of-his-head musings and rantings about every late-80s newsworthy subject. Ironically, the song that has aged most well to my ears is ""Beginning of a Great Adventure"", in which he turns his attention inward, contemplating fatherhood, albeit in his own sardonic way.Die-hard Reed fans have to love this CD; it's him all over; a good effort by one of the patriarchs of alternative rock."
3,I like half of the songs,"And of that half, I like ""Strawman"" the most. That song shows Lou at his best, if I may be so bold, and songs like ""American Whale"" show him at his worst (i.e., shut up, Lou!). This from a fan. Try ""The Blue Mask"" and ""Magic and Loss"" before ""New York"". Or, borrow all of his solo work and tape your favorites."
3,OK,"Over long and bloated. From radical noise Reed goes full circle to being a right on folk act making some rather traditional gestures. Too many words, my dear Mozart. You should let the music breathe a bit. Although too much in love with it's own word play, there is some good stuff here. American Whale is naff though, apart from the last lines."
4,Lou Gets Political,"Lou Reed's music has always brushed against the political, but on ""New York"" he goes overt like never before. The first three songs, climaxing with the classic ""Dirty Blvd.,"" are among the best he's ever written. Unfortunately, things get a bit more hit or miss after that. Many of the political concerns are now a bit dated (especially since Rudy G. has significantly alterted the quality of life in the title city). Nevertheless, this is one of Lou Reed's better albums both musically and lyrically."
4,Quite good,"One of Reed's best albums, this one features an appealingly rocking lineup of drums, bass, and two guitars. Reed doesn't sing, he talks; nevertheless there is some of his most melodic material here, standouts being ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Dirty Boulevard."" He probes the outlandish divide between rich and poor in New York, with firm candor."
3,a hit that has dated badly,"When this record first came out i was very pleased to hear lou reed finally in form again. Some of the lyrics were as sharp as ever, even if a few had that irritating political correctnes of the eighties. His singing had lost a lot of its charm, too blunt still, be it with more feeling, but wasn't as boring as in the last few years. Yet, i soon came to realise it lacked the personal sting and melodic richness and experimental verve of his last rebirth on Blue Mask. And why he had left that objective observers standpoint remains a mystery to me, it always worked so well, especially when you could sense the emotion behind it, as on Berlin. It's like with Hemingways older work, proving craftmanship but too much showing off and prozaic and tough. Better listen to Songs for Drella, where Cale invokes one last time the genius in Lou Reed, minimalistic and febrile and yet strong."
5,Reality Check,"If American Psycho's Patrick Bateman ever heard New York he might have burned his business card and become a social worker. In an era of slick, Trump worship, 'get a job,' 'how far could man go if it weren't for all these losers,' Reed provides a wake up call: ""Try to be human again."" He succeeds brilliantly. I am personally put to shame and snapped out of Style over Substance hypnotics imposed by Baywatch News shows and slick pols and Kraftwerkian pop coldness every time I put this disc on. This is real."
5,Lou's finest hour,"Just listened to this today.After over 20 years it still plays well.As a NYer living out of state, the vibeReed delivers still resonates within."
1,Lou Reed's pretentious politically-correct non-come-back,"This had three listenable tunes (whoops: ""tunes"" is probably the worst possible synonym for ""songs"" when discussing the works of Lou Reed) when it was released in 1989: ""This is the Time"", ""Good Evening, Mr. Waldheim"", and ""Dime Store Mystery"". But ""Dime Story Mystery"" is an homage to a really awful movie, Martin Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ""; ""Good Evening, Mr. Waldheim"" is as topical as the daily newspaper: it was dated within a few months of its release--or maybe within a few weeks or days; and if ""[that WAS] the time"" in 1989, it can't very well be now, can it? So: two stars then, one star now.Recommended: the mature, non-fatuous Lou Reed, his ""The Blue Mask"", his ""Legendary Hearts"", his ""New Sensations""."
3,Model 701xp Cliphead nailer does not fit with air stud,"I purchased the product knowing that the some of the cliphead nailer models may not fit in the case with the air stud installed as mentioned in other reviews. The model 701XP does not fit in the case with the stud in-place. Although I have the bushing in as well I doubt that the stud will fit even if I find 3/8"" one and can remove the bushing. Additonal research shows that most models, like the 601 series, fit the case fine. The case is very good quality but just missed the mark for for the 701xp and mostly likely the new 702XP."
4,Excellent tips for effective conflict resolution,This book has changed the way I deal with conflict. It has helped me to improve my relationships and management skills by expressing what I want clearly and resolve issues quickly and effectively.I would suggest this book to you if you feel that others are taking advantage of you being too soft or passive.
5,A Must Read,"A must read for anyone who tends to avoid conflict for the sake of keeping the peace. Dr. Ursiny meshes practical steps to overcome fear of conflict with engaging stories, while encouraging the reader to be true to self. I have recommended this book to clients and it is being used by small group discussion leaders with great results."
5,The Coward's Guide To Conflict...,"This book was a fantastic read and one that I would suggest to anyone who would have an interest in the subject of conflict resolution or those who see it as a potential self-improvement tool. Although purchased as a course textbook, this is one of the books I didn't turn loose of and will still refer to it. :-)"
2,too much fluff,I did not care for this book. I was hoping for substantive concepts based on research and facts. It has too much fluff and ideas that work only when the sun is shining. Survivor Personality has more useful concepts than this book.
2,"Ah, so that's why he loved it...","""Digger Bones"" is the author of the Universal Monsters series, so his glowing 5-star reviews are efforts to sell his own books. If reading reviews helps you decide whether or not to buy the book, then this info may be something to consider."
2,Dissapointing,"I love Emmylou, but this is not her finest work.Maybe she has just spoiled me over the years, but I expected better."
3,More country than I thought,"I have several CDs with duets/trios of Emmy Lou with Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton. I enjoyed this one, but some of the cuts were just a bit too country for my taste."
4,the best kept secret......,"this system is great. especially when you consider the price. it is plenty powerful for small to medium size rooms and it has super quality. hehehehehe, my buddy who spent $2000 on his 5.1 system came over and heard this. his jaw hit the floor when i told him i only paid $200... highly recommended!"
5,the best portal to a connoisseur's confidence,"I discovered this book even before I read its glowing feature in my Business Week magazine this week. The cat is now out of the bag -or, forgive me -the cork is now out of the bottle. Oldman's Guide gets to the point with down-to-earth and useful information. It really is all about ""shortcuts to a connoisseur's confidence,"" to borrow a line from the BW review. The organization of the book is the most helpful I've seen in a wine guide -with crisp, funny headings and clear charts. My wife and I have had a lot of fun mastering many of the book's ""secret alternative"" wines -buying up great and very affordable versions of Barbera, Dolcetto, Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, Viognier and even Chinon, the crisp French red. It has also begun our love affair with Pinot Gris, done best in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a perfect wine as the weather gets warmer. We refer back to this book endlessly for its sound advice and accessible approach."
5,A treat for wine beginners and aficionados alike,"A treat for wine beginners and aficionados alike, Oldman's ""Guide to Wine"" isfilled with snappy dialogue and insider tips that make it both a fun andaccessible read. I fall somewhere between beginner and knowledgeable, and Ilearned much from this book. My favorite chapter included a list of""instead of's"": instead of Chianti, try Primitivo, instead of Merlot, tryArgentinian Malbec, and so on. It's a great way to branch out beyond thetired old classics. Oldman encourages his readers to explore new things andmakes this process as unintimidating as possible."
2,(Too much) accessible for wine lovers.,"It is really accessible for all newcomers in the world of wine, but is quite annoying for those who already have a basic knowledge of the subject. In addition, I think that the book is not addressing the issue of wine tasting with the proper detail, and this is a great flaw for a book that is expected to guide casual drinkers into the secrets and the pleasures of wine."
4,bought for a gift,I bought this for my father who asked for it last year but I was unable to locate it until this year. He is pleased with this CD.
2,A Tribute to Howard & Vestal Goodman,"I love the Gaithers music, this CD has wonderful songs on it BUT the quality of the recording is so poor this CD will end up in my never listen to pile."
5,EnJoy,I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THIS DVD IT'S A BLESSING TO ME. ME AND THE GOODMAN'S GO BACK TO THE LATE 70'S THEY CAME TO OUR CHURCH AND SANG AND THAN I SEEN THEM SINGING AT SCHOOL'S THEY ARE GOOD. DALE
3,"OK product, but crappy bearing","Ordered the set for my wood lathe. Amazon shipped it fast and received within two days. The centers come in a wooden box with foam inserts. All looked nice and shiny. The two spur centers are sharp right out of the box, and seems high quality. I'm not sure if they are high speed steel as I haven't used them long enough to tell. But the cup live center is a different story. Right out of the box, I notice the bearing is not turning smoothly. As you rotate it by hand, you will feel a click once per every rotation. It seems that the bearing has a defect in the bearing track. I didn't bother putting them on the lathe, as the rough bearing will certainly ruin a work piece. I returned it the next day."
2,ugh!,These are not what I expected. The #2mt is tubular versus solid. Yhe knock out bar for my Jet lathe is a perfect press fit into the drive center when I tried to knock it out. I had a hell of a time to get the two pieces apart. I don't like the cheapness of the unit construction.
4,Spirituals Masterpiece,"This is a northern European choir doing southern negro spirituals. Sounds odd but it is one of the best that I have heard. The best single is ""Ain't Got Time To Die""."
4,Very happy,"I have not yet tried to record, but I have played a couple movies and I am very happy with it so far, good sound & picture quality. Very easy to set up.I would recommend this to any one who is looking for a quality inexpensive VCR!.I gave it 4 stars just because the remote is one of the worst looking things that I have seen yet, RCA could have done better."
5,amazing,This is one of the few real impressive singer songwriter albums I have heard. Haunting and extraordinarily musical. Just amazing... Hope her next (1999) almost-release is available soon!
3,Great TV...when it works,"I bought this TV over a similar RCA 34"" widescreen more for the excellent quality history that Toshiba's are noted for (vs. RCA). However, for some reason the TV turns itself on and off at will and often times won't restart. Toshiba repair has been scheduled.When working, the TV is excellent. Great picture with a digital Satelite signal and outstanding with progressive scan DVD. I was worried about going with a widescreen vs. the standard 4:3 aspect ratio sets. Trust me....this is the way to go. We quickly got used to the widescreen format and love it. The Toshiba does a great job at stretching the images from standard signals and not showing too much distortion. The Toshiba remote control is substandard and not universal. We purchased a Sony programmable remote to operate all our compenents...it works great."
3,"Blues, and nothing but the blues","Bill is best heard live...he and the band seem to lack the energy they exude onstage on this CD. Still a good listen, however. A good addition to any blues collection. For those unaware, Bill has played with many of the blues masters over the years, including B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, and Muddy Waters. In the early 60's he was a member of Jimmy James and the Flames; you may know Jimmy James better as Jimi Hendrix.Late!"
5,Dear Fairies,"This is a magical book for little girls who believe in fairies. My five-year-old daughter absolutely loves it. There is tiny pink stationary and a special gold pencil for your child to write their own fairy letters. We hide them in the garden and always receive a reply! It's so much fun, but you must be committed to keeping the correspondence going, otherwise face a very disappointed child."
5,You Can't Go Wrong,"Great picture, stereo sound, a flat screen so images don't distort, you just can't beat this price. When you turn the ""mute"" switch on the set it automatically goes into closed caption mode so you can read what everyone's saying even if you can't hear it.The remote is a luminous light-up, easy to manouver, it's all good. Just don't try picking up this set by yourself. It's as heavy as ten of your huskiest chums!"
2,Didn't work,"Even though they made EVERY effort to satisfy us and send us a working product, in the end, it didn't . .. work . . .They refunded our money, and bent over backwards to try and make the sale right. It's just that the product didn't work out in the end."
1,Good Cast horrible movie,I cannot understand why these artists took roles in this turkey. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in my life.
1,What a wast of resources.,"Unbeknown to me is the focus some screenwriters, producers and directors have on the utilization of available resources (human and financial). Here the film is packed with talented and aspiring people - but there is something seriously lacking - the entertainment factor. I became quite disappointed when I discover that the potential of a product, such as Dr. T and the Woman, can become so disillusioned by the need to achieve what seams to be the producer and director's personal watermark - 'something I can leave behind'. These people are not directly associated with the film at the same level as these talented and established actors, and therefore, should really conduct some market research before endeavoring to navigate the seas of entertainment. Good luck to you all and keep the coffee handy!"
1,Very Bad Movie,"This movie was a waste of however much it has cost to make it. Moreover, it was a waste of everyone's time who bothered to watch it ( including me ). Honestly, I didn't think either Helen Hunt or Richard Gere could possibly be bored enough to spend time on such a bad film. Actually they should be ashamed by how little creativity and how much bad taste it represents. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
1,Absolutely Jaw Droppingly Bizarre,This has to be the worst film I have ever seen - It even beats the awful Eyes Wide Shut.None of the film gels. The scenes jump from one to another and its hard to follow.We watched it solely to see what happened at the end and if it would all make sense. Sorry but it didn't.At the end of the film we were left with our mouths open.What a waste of time. Such a good cast but a terrible story
2,Major disappointment,"Except for Helen Hunt and Fawcett's ""stroll"" I rate this as one of the worst films by a respected auture that I've ever seen. I love Altman, whether kansas city or cookie's fortune, short cuts or The Player...and of course gosford park is one of the best films ever made...but this tripe was such a waste of time. check out the self-satisfied smiles in the first hustle-bustle scene. Really a work of someone resting on their laurals."
1,Horrible!!,"Please don't waste your time and money on this awful movie. It's a shame because it brings together an amazing cast, but the outcome is so bad it's funny. Incorporated were weird and unexplicable plot twists, especially the ending. This movie is the worst I have seen in a long time. Helen Hunt play the same stupid, annoying roles that she always plays. Spend your time seeing a better movie. This one is an utter waste of time."
1,Not even Close to Gere's 2nd Best,"I was really dissapointed in this film. It was flighty, and had at least five sub-plots going, all of which went nowhere. He was cute as usual, but that's about all the movie had going for it."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this movie based on the reviewer's comments on the DVD cover. Boy, am I ashamed! We viewed it with friends and had to turn it off after 15 minutes, - that is, about three gynecological exams into the feature. What a total waste of talent and disappointing mess of a movie. We decided to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity instead and I must say, it saved the evening. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Bad Ending,"Gere is great. Nice to see Shelley Long in a movie again. Tara Reid was kind of wasted (she is very talented). Liked the themes that were being dealt with in the movie, but my god what an awful ending! One of the worst endings I have ever seen. I know what it was trying to say but it was such a cop out, and it left hanging quite a great deal with all the characters we had come to know throughout the course of the film. This is one of those movies where I can understand why my friends don't like Altman. *See Nashville, The Long Goodbye, The Player. Those are his best films."
2,This is two hours of my life I can't get back.,"Although there were a few humorous parts in this movie, there was no plot. I kept trying to find it, but it wasn't there. The movie was so far fetched that I would like to slap the writers. It's a waste of time and money. They leave a lot of lose ends untied and just when you think the movies going somewhere, it doesn't. I'm ashamed of you Richard Gere."
3,Another Entertaining Movie from Robert Altman,"I've seen several of Robert Altman's movies (MASH, Popeye, Gosford Park, Nashville, A Prairie Home Companion, The Player) and have enjoyed them. Dr. T & The Women is no exception. I really enjoyed Richard Gere's character and empathized with him throughout. The ending is strange (like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"", as others have pointed out), but I would rather have that ending than something depressing. I want to see more of Altman's movies after watching this one."
3,Not a bad flick,"I really don't know what all the hype is about. This movie is not as bad as these reviewers are protraying it. It is a bit slow at first but I found it quite funny. You people need to get a sense of humour. The only surprise was the graphic child birth scene. It was a bit too much in that respect. I would recommend seeing the movie, especially if you're a Richard Gere fan like I am."
1,Painful Altman Misfire,"An attractive ensemble cannot salvage director Robert Altman's disastrous ""romantic comedy"" - one of his all-time worst. ""Dr. T & The Women"" (2000) is so appallingly bad that it makes ""Prt-à-Porter"" look like ""Gosford Park."" Richard Gere's likable portrayal belongs in a different movie."
2,Only For Farrah Fans To Buy a Bad Movie!,"Richard Gere is prominent Dr. T the gynecologist. The opening scene has Mr. Gere looking at an elderly lady during her gynecolgical check up. From the opening scene, you think this movie would be funny. However, a talented cast was wasted in this mediocre script. Poor Farrah had only a few scenes but did have third star billing. She does do a nude scene in the shopping mall's water fountain. The other cast is in small scenes as well, with maybe the exception of Helen Hunt. Shelly Long is funny in her role as Richard Gere's assistant, who is secretly in love with him. The lesbian sequence should have been eliminated because it was very small and didn't add much to the plot of the movie. But then again, the movie doesn't really have much plot. Anyway, if you are a Farrah fan and want to collect all of her movies, add this to your collection in her memory. However, I for one am glad that I only spent $1.99 for this dvd. Sorry to the Robert Altman's fans."
3,good movie,"I'm surprised by the apparent preponderance of negative reviews here. I wonder if it has something to do with the rather negative view of upper middle class Texas that is implicit in the movie.I thought the film was excellent, with plenty of humour and a fairly interesting relationship between the Gere and Helen Hunt characters, all delivered in Altman's characteristic manner. Not top-level Altman, but still interesting and entertaining."
1,UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH,"This was one of the most horrible, distasteful and disturbing movies I have ever seen. It left a lot to be desired, which you can say many times. It was completely random and bizarre and don't see it! I assure you, there are plenty of other decent movies out there, and this one is really not one of them!! I'm warning you..."
1,Don't Waste your money,"This is the worst film I have ever seen. From begining to end, this the worst produced and directed film I have ever had the misfortune to see. The ending was unnecessary and tramatic. The only reason I saw the end at all is due to my neigbor. Whom mistakingly believed this film had to get better at some point. Boy was he ever wrong.I do not know why this film was created and why Richard Gere would allow himself to be cast in this film. What a bad career move for such a wonderful person with such style."
1,Dr. T & The Never Finished Watching,"My Review: My True Rating Scale is a -5 stars. I did not finish watching the ""MOVIE."" No one should waste time watching this ""MOVIE."" It looks like I will be forced to break this dvd into small pieces and throw it in the trash."
2,nahiswhattheysay,This movie was unrealistic and boring from the start. What is wrong with Richard Gere? He usually shows up in movies with substance.Poor Farah never had a chance.I would reccomend this movie to those having trouble sleeping
1,Don't You Dare!,"Don't you dare watch this... unless you are glutton for punishment.Back when I saw this movie in the theatres years ago, I was with friends. I wanted to cry! I couldn't believe I wasted $8.00 on a ticket and almost two hours of my life with this rotten flick. Unfortunately, since it was considered socially unacceptable to get up and walk out of the theatre I sat through the ENTIRE painful film.Even then, I thought that no movie could ever come close to being this horrendous, including those made at home by a high schooler. I believe, to this day, my assumption is correct. For every bad movie I see, I can say, ""Well, at least it wasn't as bad as Dr. T and The Women.""I hope this helps."
1,A Different Kind of Pretty Woman,"In my opinion, Richard Gere, Helen Hunt and many of the other stars of this movie are outstanding performers. However,this movie was not one of their best. I realize it is rated R, which would explain the nudity, but it was supposed to be a comedy. The few parts that were a bit funny, really weren't. In conclusion, I would not reccomend this film."
1,I've seen worse - but not often,"I expected this to be a ""chick flick"", but my wife and daughters agreed with me that Dr. T and the Women wasn't worth the cost of the rental. The story just drags on and on and the ending could only be described as a bizarre idea from the twisted mind of someone overly influenced by the beginning of the Wizard of Oz.As bad as the movie was, the ""making of"" feature on the DVD is even worse. It appears that the director and actors are genuinely proud of this movie - or maybe they saved all their acting talent for the ""making of"" feature. They can't be serious and it's sad to see them gushing over how wonderful they think this poor excuse of a movie is. Remind me to skip anything else Robert Altman directs... I'll forgive Richard Gere and Helen Hunt for this one."
1,A Terrible Waste Of Money And Talent,"I like Richard Gere....I like Helen Hunt...I like Laura Dern...but this movie is TERRIBLE! What a waste of talent!It was worse than a waste of money...the movie was so terrible that I did something with a video, I have never ever done before! I threw it in the trash! Sad to say but true.I don't recall ever seeing such a worthless, tacky movie! If I could have gave it a zero star, I certainly would have.Don't waste your money...go spend it on a video worthy of being in your video library!"
1,Dr. T. Goes Nowhere,"In this movie the most distracting thing for me was the fact that all the women were talking over one another and you could not follow what they were saying or follow the movie. The Love interest story played by Helen Hunt goes nowhere and leaves you feeling flat and down. At the end of the movie they had an un-necessary birth scene that bordered on hard core ponography, just too much. I believe that the actors in this movie did a fine job acting but they had nothing to work with. Was there a plot? I really don't think so. I almost did not watch the movie to the end. There are much better movies out there so save your money and rent or buy something else for your collection. This movie is horrible and rates as one of the worst movies I have seen."
3,Helen Hunt and Hormones,"Robert Altman has a lot to say about male and female attitudes and relationships, not to mention being true to yourself and accepting your lot in life. Unfortunately, he tries to say it ALL in this one movie, with inconsistant results. Richard Gere is at his charming best as the put-upon titled Gynecologist trying to remain the calm center of the chaotic estrogen storm around him. Gere's on screen romantic chemistry with golf pro Helen Hunt is undeniable, and props also to Shelley Long, in excellent form as the good doctor's dedicated nurse (no, really, Shelley Long). With all this riding for it though, ""Dr. T"" does itself in by dragging on too long and getting bogged down in an unnecessary subplot about his daughter's wedding. Somewhere inside this tedium is a great movie trying desperately to get out. What a shame Altman can't thin out all his ideas to find it."
1,Free Prime Rental,Thank goodness this was a free prime rental. We watched it for about 20 minutes and still didn't know what the plot was. It was so dry and boring.
2,Just plain bad!,"At first I thought this was just the ultimate chick flic. But after speaking to women about this, they hated it too. Twenty minutes of this film is spent with characters on the phone planning a wedding. The women are obnoxious and very unlikable. Somehow we are supposed to like Gere's character who has a fling with Helen Hunt while his wife if in the hospital.I give it 2 stars instead of one due to the great kissing between Liv Tyler and Kate Hudson."
3,Dr. T & the women,"This movie is ok, but too many women with too many problems. I would hate be Dr. T. with all his women problems and being in constant demand. The best part of this movie is at the end during the storm."
1,the stupidist movie I've ever seen,"This is a colossal waste of time and talent. With a cast like this, there is no excuse. Altman ought to be ran out of town on a rail."
1,Where's the Altman we all knew and loved?,"Has Altman lost it? He creates this moody, unsatisfied leading man character, who is pontentially interesting. Surrounds him with flaky, self-absorbed, women, some of whom are clearly nuts, others less obviously so. Great setup. I was hooked. Then... nowhere. It's almost like Altman realized he was running out of film stock, and decided to wrap that day. NB how Dr. T learns Spanish, with no prompting, in about ten seconds during the last reel. Very disappointing film from a former master."
3,Dr.T review,"As for the product...i received the movie in great condition, no scratches no skipping or stalling during the viewing of the movie.The movie itself is a cute,funny drama. I like it even more for the fact that it has shots of Dallas in it.I did not like the way they portray Dallas women, but a cute movie non the less."
1,Should be packaged in a black box with a white stripe.,"With all the great books that are out there,you wonder why someone was paid to write a turkey like this. It also makes you wonder how desperate these ""stars"" were that they took this job after reading the script. I bought the DVD sight unseen for my fiance because she likes Richard Gere ""chick flicks"". She had me turn it off and throw it out after the first 10 minutes!"
1,Paints women in a bad light,"Not sure what exactly they were trying to say through this film, but the impression we received was this: No matter how well you treat them or how well you know them, women will use you, abuse you until you go nuts.Very strange film. Did not like it at all."
2,Not as amazing as we thought it would be.,"My first mistake with this one was assuming that a price-tag of [price] meant the unit would be good to go after the initial set-up. Never assume...The picture quality varies considerably from channel-to- channel (even with digital cable)The colors fluctuate wildly as well. We have to re-set the colors and brightness levels each time the channel is changed. DVD widescreen playback is another issue! (same as above) PLUS the DVD picture bows in slightly (almost 1/4"" overall at the center of the bow) at the top and bottom of the display ,which is VERY ANNOYING!Its not due to the DVD Player, as any widescreen presentation, as well as any channel-bar type images(like on cable-guide or the news-channels scroll bars) bow as well!Im planning on returning this item to the place I purchased it, and exchanging for the Sony Wega!"
1,JVC HR-DVS3U not recommended for Sony Camcorder users,"There appears to be a comptatibility issue between the Sony MiniDV format and the JVC miniDV format. This is coming directly from the technicans at JVC. I purchased this JVC HR-DVS3U unit so I could edit the miniDV tapes from my Sony TRV-20 camcorder. But when I play a tape (which has been recorded on my Sony camcorder) on the JVC deck through the firewire output to either my computer or back to my camcorder, the JVC unit displays a error code U:01 and the video from the firewire output is all distorted."
1,Don't waste your money!,I've gone through two of these decks. They worked fine with Final Cut Pro and I enjoyed the SVHS to DV transfer ease... BUT... they are cheaply made and break down after any extended use. Same thing happened to a colleague. Repair cost as much as the price of a new deck! Not acceptable. I'll never use another one of these.
3,Not her best,"I have read all of Bevery Barton's other books for Zebra & enjoyed them, but I could not get into Quinn Cortez. He is not a likeable hero. The story itself is good, no problems there. The problem for me was Quinn & Annabelle. I personally thought they had no chemistry and I found nothing appealing about Quinn, except that he has good looks. For followers of Beverly Barton it is worth reading but nothing to get exicted over."
4,good reading,"enjoyed this book very much and have ordered others from this author, hope they are as good as this one was."
4,The start of a good tradition,"A mere 19 years old at the time she recorded this, Tinita Tikaram cut a great album on the first try. With an earthy, mature voice and moody sensibility, the song ""Twist In My Sobriety"" caught the attention of all who heard it back in 1988. This was during the period when Sade and other exotic chanteuses were striking it rich, and Tikaram was being aimed at that same audience.""Ancient Heart"" is the best of her several albums. From the upbeat opening of ""Good Tradition"" to the statement of the artist as a young woman (""Preyed Upon"") that ends the disk, ""Ancient Heart"" was a terrific document of a woman discovering herself minus the jailbaiter mentality that pervades so many current young female artists. There are more than a few echoes of Joni Mitchell and Joan Armatrading to be found here, and ""Ancient Heart"" is worth the fourth star just for ""Twist In My Sobriety"" alone."
4,Great first start...,"I have had this cd in my collection for alot of years and recently brought it out and gave it a serious listen. I find it alittle uneven but it does (like alot of past reviews say, have its better moments. When I first heard the song ""Twist in my sobriety"" I was hooked and picked up the cd, not really knowing what the heck the words to the song really meant. Overall a good sounding cd, it fits much better today than it did up against the crazy 80's and the synthesizers and fake drum beats. Check out ""Valentine Heart"", ""Poor Cow"", ""Cathedral Song"" and the killer ""For all these years"" and more."
3,Not so Poor Cow,"For all these years, the song that has stuck in my head from this ravising debut is Cathedral Song and Poor Cow, the former because the heartbreakingly beautiful instrumental version was used as the introduction to a TV documentary about Tikaram (basically the song without the vocals, played over the opening credits, this fantastic helicopter-shot, a panoramic flight over a bleak landscape - a shame that it is not available on record as far as I know), and the latter because of its wry lyrics, bouncy melody and quirky rhodes accompaniment. Is it a plea for vegetarianism or animal rights? Who knows. More handsome than beautiful in the Britney Spears sense, she was obviously not your ordinary teenybopper, and the poor cows on the plate and butterflies in the bowl probably continue to sing her praises. So do I."
3,Not for the professional,"This gun is lightweight and easy to use. However it is not the type of gun to be used every day. Mine lasted about 2 months before it broke. It would be okay for the weekend carpenter, but not for the professional. Spend the extra money and buy a Makita."
4,Almost perfect,I expected a little more from a nailer that says Senco in little letters on the side. I know it's not a true Senco but I guess it's the closest thing. I've had several brad nailers and this is my second favorite. It beats the other imports hands down. Plenty of power. Smooth operation. Very quiet. Depth of drive is easily adjustable . I love the exhaust. It's not adjustable. It doesn't have to be. It is muffled and gradually exits the tool at the back of the handle. No more blowing dust around the room or worse in your eyes! I wish all guns implemented this improvement.I also like the rather large rubber grip. About the only complaint I have is the no mar tip is easy to lose. Oh and it's not as refined as a Senco. But neither is anything else.
1,Phasing out Accuset!!!,I found this on another website...AccuSet Power ToolsSPECIAL NOTICE! Senco will be phasing out the AccuSet line of tools and replacing them with tools under the Senco brand name.I wish the folks at Amazon would be up front about this...
5,Completed Set,Our son has all 4 in this series that are available and they have become his favorite which is amazing since he is 3 and a half and has over 100 books in his library. He especially likes them since dad has a John Deere lawn tractor and he has a John Deere Gator and Power Pull tractor.
3,just ok,This is ok. It gives some good tips but mostly it seems like they are things that worked for her personally. I didn't feel like these were well thought out for the average person.
3,A People Magnet Already?,"This book is a good start if you are a shy person and want to become more extroverted. If you are a social person already, don't bother. It is really well written."
2,Nothing that hasn't been said before,"There isn't much in People Magnet that hasn't already been written in numerous books and magazine articles before. The book is aimed at both sexes, but the pink and white cover will probably put off most male readers, who will dismiss it as aimed at the female market (and wouldn't be caught dead reading such an effeminate-looking book).Lowndes' style is easygoing and a good quick read, but so was Dale Carnegie's ""How To Win Friends And Influence People,"" and that was first published in 1937. Lowndes is able to take advantage of more recent studies in male/female interpersonal studies, but there's not much new ground covered here.People Magnet is like any other book in its category (or any diet book, for that matter); if you follow the guidelines, you stand a good chance of achieving the goals you seek. If you don't, then the book gathers dust and you've wasted your money."
2,Leil Lowndes' other books are better.,"Ms. Lowndes' other books are a far better read than this one. This book doesn't seem to be as well thought out as her other books such as ""How To Instantly Connect With Anyone"" and ""How To Talk To Anyone"".Read the other two books instead of this one. Give the other two books as high school graduation gifts. We all need to improve our people skills."
2,Makes things up,"Its an easy read and an entertaining book. However, it is hilarious when she talks about ""In Japan...mothers will never tell their daughter that what they did was wrong....they just look at them and say 'uh oh...we have a booboo here' or something or the other."" I am Japanese, and my mom would smack me upside the top of my head if I did something bad. I wish she would not make stuff up like this. Also, the contracts with ourselves are lame. If anybody saw me making those contracts with myself I would be the laughing stock of Nevada. This is the first ""feel good about yourself"" book I've read, and probably the last. Once a lifetime is enough...most of the info in there is info that most people have heard from word of mouth sometime in their lives already. Nothing new, and I haven't even read any other similar books!..."
1,"How to be a people magnet (by, Leil Lowndes)","I just finished this book and all it really seemed to say is if you want to make friends look for the lonely, and or odd people that no-one else talks to and befriend them. Also some of the references she uses are wrong like saying The Stockholm Syndrome is the phenomenon of women being attracted to bad boys. The Stockholm Syndrome is a victim developing an attraction for their capture like a kidnapper or hostage situation. Also she seems to have a fake sounding story for everything. In all I wasted a few bucks and a few hours on this book. Live and learn."
1,Avidread,"Instead of reading this book I recommend that you be yourself, make use of kindness, and think of others. Lowndes comes across with good intentions, but her innate social climbing and manipulating tactics are a turn off. If I had to sum up this book in one word it would be, sad."
1,only east coast will get anything out of this book,"I will never forget the time I was in Boston and helped a blind man board a subway train. The doors nearly closed right on him! A lady nearby was truly amazed that someone would be so nice as to help a stranger having difficulty.This book is for those who rarely experience common courtesy and have no clue as to how to behave in a civil manner.If you get much out of this book, it's time for some drastic action!I think the author needs to move to a more friendly environment!"
1,Fluffy reading,"The material in this book is somehow intriguing and indeed useful. What drags it down is the author's style, which is somewhere between gossip and hairdresser's conversation.It's a pity that a lot of energies are spent digging into the countless fluff to get to the bottom line, which, as said before, is not bad.An advice? Read only the summary boxes in every chapter: you'll get a downhill ride throughout the book in 30 minutes to 1 hr (depending on your inspired thoughts)."
3,OK Book,"This book does not give as many good tips on how to build good relatioship as are given in the other books by the same author.However it has some interesting discussion on the nature of Life, Friends and Love, which makes the book still worth the money to buy.Peter"
4,A great band's attempt at commercial success--mixed results.,"The best songs on this album--""I'll Be You', ""Achin' to Be"" and ""Rock and Roll Ghost"" are right up there with Westerberg's best. The album overall, however, has the feel of a band striving to be something they aren't and aren't even sure they want to be."
2,The worst Replacements album by far,"""I'll Be You"" is a great song, but this album in general STINKS! It's not the sloppy, loveable sound that 'Mats fans have grown to love. Some people admire Paul's attempt at ""maturity"", I say 'pah!' I never play this album...ever."
2,John Bon-Westerberg????,"Not a good album, but actually it was their only bad one. There really aren't any bad songs on this album but man the production is just god awful. If I were westerberg I would take these tunes and get a decent producer and then do em over, because they really aren't that bad."
1,Do exactly what the album asks you to do!,"Don't tell a soul about this album, because they might get the notion that this is what the 'Mats were all about. P.U. A stinker from beginning to end, this was Paul's greatest VH-1 splurge. In five short years, the band that put out LET IT BE (BUY THIS), turned into a sappy, Kenny Rogers cover band. Do yourself a favor, buy nothing they put out on Sire/Warner. The records that came from Twin/Tone are pure gold. The only slight exception is Tim, which had 5 or 6 true gems on it. But this? It signalled the death of one of my favorites, and I admit, I was bitter. Still am, obviously. Go to Twin/Tone country!"
1,Don't tell anyone,"The number one reason why chorus is a poor choice for guitar. Paul Westerberg is too good of a songwriter for a total flop, but his grain-heavenly voice can't save this one. A few redeeming moments, but one left off the album. I doubt his pop stardom would've made me think otherwise. (noteworthy: ""Church,"" ""I won't,"" ""we know the night"") Pales in comparison to classic lp's ""Let it Be,"" and ""Tim""."
2,Bob where are you?,"I always felt that Bob Stinson (and Chris Mars to an extent)was the only thing keeping Paul Westbergh from going totally pop. Bob gave the band a reckless and harder sound. Somehow the boys were able to make an excellent first effort (Please to Meet Me) after Bob died, but this album showed that ""Pleased.."" was a fluke. This album should not even be compared with any of the Replacements' albums before. It is pop, pop and more pop. Oh sure, they have one or two songs that might have made it on to ""Tim"" or ""Pleased.."", but overall, it was a tragically bad effort by a legendary band."
5,good place to start your addiction,This was the first 'Mats CD I heard and it was for me the beginning of the change for me. I stopped listening to Kasey Kasem's advice and went my own way. Paul Westerberg's lyrics are amazing and the rest of the guys did their part to support the wordage for a perfect melodic ride.
4,A nice change of pace for a great band,"I like this album a lot. Westerberg's songwriting was maturing, the band was trying to find a way to stay fresh and interested in what they were doing. They missfired on a few songs, but mainly in the arrangement of them, as many of these songs really came alive in concert. If you want a good example, look for the bootleg ""Sheet Shower and Shave"", it's got two sets, one opening for Tom Petty and another in a club in Madison. The first word isn't really ""sheet"" but the censors like it better. I recommend the book 'All Over But The Shouting' to anyone. A fun read, puts you in the heart of the Minneapolis scene of the 80's."
4,Great Westerburg record,"The people who dis this record do so because they are Replacement fans, not Paul Westerburg fans. I happen to appreciate both. This is a great record but is really the beginning of Paul's solo career."
3,This album was too schizophrenic,"A good effort & a nice try, with ""I'll Be You"" as an all-time classic of underground music. Unfortunately, the production is muddy, unclear. The songs as a whole don't get treated that well. Don't think the 'Mats producer really knew what they wanted this album to be & it shows. Scott Litt did a much better job with All Shook Down."
2,Weakest Link,"The Mats were among the all-time greats. Westerberg is an American Ray Davies. And, like the Kinks, the Mats reached their nadir in the late 80s. Bad hair metal, totally 80s production is completely inappropriate for a Davies or Westerberg song. I've got no beef with Paul maturing. One can't do the whiskey-before-gym class routine forever. ""All Shook Down"" is a better album. Growing up doesn't have to sound as lame & cheesey as this."
2,Westerberg Set The Bar So High,"The reason many 'Mats fans aren't that fond of this album is that Westerberg set the bar so high on previous albums that this one falls dramatically short in the songwriting department. ""I'll Be You"" is as good aanything he's ever written, and ""Talent Show"" gets high praises, but after that, nothing seems to work. Unlike, ""All Shook Down"", most of this album is just to drab in comparison to the standard he set as a songwriter. If I was asked which 'Mats LP not to own, this would be the one, (save ""I'll Be You"", of course.)"
4,"Good re-master. But, hit and miss attempt by The 'Mats","First off, the re-master itself: Comparing with my original 'Mats CD, the songs don't have that ""muddy"" sound that were common to CD's at that time. The volume has been brought up a few notches, but I don't notice any clipping (which is what's important). Overall, a definite improvement over the old CD. And the song extras are a welcome addition, of course.As for the original album tracks themselves, I personally find them to be hit or miss. After ""PTMM"", everyone was expecting big things and this was supposed to be their crossover album into the mainstream. But, that was not to be. Still, I like Side One a lot, even ""We'll Inherit The Earth"" (granted, it could have been so much better). And Side Two is still worthy for a listen, if just for ""I'll Be You"" and the underrated ""Darlin' One"". I believe it's aged well, all things considered."
3,Hot Nude Yoga,"This is great but I wish it would be more honest in the sence of when men get together completely nude, sometimes we get a bit excited and it is ok. There is nothing wrong for our bodies are beautiful!!! I'm glad to see that men can work out together and should in the buff. It helps with male bonding I think."
1,Very Hot When In Use,I am not sure that I am even going to use this much longer.I have not had a charger that got this hot to the touch before.I can't decide if this charger is a fire hazard or not. It leaves me that uneasy about how hot it gets.Would not buy it again for sure.
1,"Horrible, just horrible...","Great computer, horrible powercord. I've had a couple of these and they burn out fast. Dell should be ashamed..."
3,Adapter,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
4,Amazone purchase,Good adapter worked fine... plug does not fit completely on the laptop but gets the job done.
5,Great Music at a Great Price,"This CD is truly one of the milestones in recording history. In this CD, Sir Georg Solti leads the Chicago Symphony with the hand of a conductor extrordinaire. This amazing orchestra, combined with world famous choruses, come together to create a thrilling listening experience for the Mahler fan and novice alike. It is a ""must have"" for every collection."
3,"Incredibly successful for good reason, but not musically","Decca's recording engineers were the best in the world at capturing orhestral impact, as they showed in Solti's Ring cycle. His Mahler Eighth won equal fame for sonic drama--this huge symphony sounds as massive exploding from home speakers as it might in live performance. The orchestra and soloists are also first rate, and to this day--as the reviews here demonstrate--Solti's version ranks very high in sales and fame.Musically, however, thre is the usual high-voltage Solti aggressive drive throughout and little poetry. The sonics are surprisingly shrill and uncomfortable in this digital remastering--what hapened to the gorgeous bloom of the LP originals? I have known this set since the day it shot out of the cannon, and it's a relief to hear far more musical versions by Haitink, Sinopoli, Bernstein, Abbado, Gielen, and Colin Davis."
4,Half Definitive,"The recordings of Georg Solti seem to fall into two categories: (1) Beautifully detailed and gorgeous, impreccably phrased and vigorous. (2) Overwrought and hysterical at the expense of thoughfulness and detail.This legendary recording of Mahler's 8th has both. Much too impulsive and dense in the first movement, one only has to listen to recordings by say, Tennstedt or Sinopoli to understand what is missing.In Part II, however, everything is just about perfect. The tempos, textures are ideal and very beautiful, and the soloists are all one could ask for. (Far from being ""too light"", these solists are exactly what is needed to clarify and soften the textures of this massive piece). Solti finds so many beautiful moments that cannot be heard in any other recording.I have yet to hear the perfect Mahler 8th. If you don't mind switching performances in the middle, I would recomment Tennstedt/Solti."
2,Victorian Dream Homes,"This is not for you if you want Victorian homes with Victorian floor plans. It might be for you if you want modern homes (e.g. with ""kitchen islands"", attached multi-car garages, and 'open floor plans for the new century') that are designed (some more than others) to look Victorian-esque on the outside.Maybe if they called it ""Neo-Victorian Modern Dream Homes"", people who want that would buy it and give it 4 or 5 stars."
2,Buy it if you like repeats,"I purchased this book with much excitement and enthusiasm only to find at least 75% of the floor plans have already been published. Not only have they already been published, but many of them in the first book with the same title. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book unless you've never purchased a house plan book of Victorian homes."
3,My first book by Faith Baldwin,"Jenny was a 20 year old who was promoted as secretary to the shipyard manager, Justice. She had a married sister, Ede, who was having an affair with Justice. Jennny thought she could divert him and show Ede what a cad he was. Both were living with their grandmother. Steve, who was older than Jenny, was a very good friend, and was fighting in the war. He had planned to be a surgeon when he got out of the service. He had injured his hand during the war and would not be able to be the surgeon he had dreamed of. In fact he would have to be a GP. This book did have an ending different than I imagined. It was better than I thought it would be."
2,"small radio, small sound","I purchased this radio mainly because of the built in speaker and that part of the stereo works great. the sound of it is amazing for the small size. BUT when i plug in my headphones(my own, not the ones they supplied) it sounded so flat and hollow. Also sangean products have a reputation for getting good reception but this radio does not. My CHEAPER sony walkman gets better reception with a lot less hiss. I am going to return this radio and either try a different brand or give a higher quality sangean a try."
5,Worth every penny,"I saw Sons of the Never Wrong perform in the Masthouse in my little town of Woodstock. They are amazing and vert talented musicains as well as wonderful people. I own Consequence of Speech and One it By Hand. I recommend getting both cds, but I love this one just because of the Girl Shanty song by Sue, she has an amazing voice. If you ever get the chance to see them live I highly recommend it, there performance was absoulutely magical and I will never forget it."
4,Brings back good memories,"This collection contains two of Petra's early albums so it's a good bargain. I used to listen to them decades ago, during the vinyl record age, and was happy to find this good deal on Amazon."
1,Can not use this in USA,"The C-range frequencies are not illegal to use in USASEE: fcc.gov/cgb/wirelessmicrophones/The Sennheiser mics are great. Just need an A, B or G band unitnot a C, D or E if you are in the USABuyer be warned."
4,Great mic for video projects,"Our video company is constantly doing interviews for our pieces, and this mic is a real lifesaver. A colleague of mine, who works on reality shows, recommended the Sennheiser and we've not been disappointed. If you're on a small-to-medium budget, this is the right wireless lav mic for you."
3,Cute!,"The cave is pretty cute. It's mishapen however. At any rate, even if the product was shaped properly, it seems my cat is too large for it."
1,Not the Full Book,"This kindle edition contains only 8 chapters. The full book has 18 chapters and 16 appendices. Amazon carries another kindle edition that appears to be complete. Check out the table of contents before you buy.Also, the file should probably be 5,000 kb or larger."
3,Dated,"Fascinating in a class room sort of way. I love history, but this is pretty detailed and a little dated since it was written in 1905."
5,This Tool is worth the $$$$$,I have used this tool for everything from installing hardwood floors to finish trim work. It works great for everything that I can throw at it! I do have to watch the angle when I am firing nails into HARD woods so that it will set the nail. I am now adding its little senco brother (FP25XP) to the shelf and expect the same high quality that I have found in the SNF40! Happy Nailing!!!!
5,"senco, the only finish nailer to buy.","I purchased my Senco SFN40 about 4 years ago. I also purchased their SLP20 18 gauge brad nailer. Prior to that time, I owned a Bostitch N60. As a trim carpenter, my nailers are used on a daily basis. Their Neverlube design eliminates oil exhaust spray and I don't have to be bothered toting oil around with me. Both nailers come in a durable plastic case. They are ergonomically designed for comfortable use all day long. The SFN40 has an adjustable depth of drive and is a dream for setting door jamb and base molding. I use only Senco brand nails in my gun and have not experienced any jams that were nail related. The Senco technical support staff is a pleasure to deal with and they stand behind their product. This gun is not cheap and you can probable buy a competitor's model two for one. However, if you are in the market for a quality nailer that will last a long time, then the SFN40 is the one to buy. Remember, ""you get what you pay for""."
3,And you don't have to listen!,"The pictures are nice but there's a lesson here--in the way society rewards people. I like the old Yes records as much as anybody, but not because of Steve Howe. His thickety-thickety tone & choppy, sloppy runs are not exactly soulful.There are so many players, from shredders to jazz masters with real talent and heart. But this guy ends up with so much money, he can't spend it all.By the way, not only does he take all these beautiful guitars out of circulation; he often carves them up with ""modifications"" some of which are bizarre to say the least (a Les Paul with 4 humbuckers? Cool, Steve).And don't forget to read about his guitar ""tree"" where he clamps the poor things to a wacky ""lazy susan"". The only thing this collection is missing is one of those Hamer guitars with six identical necks, like Rick Nielson has."
4,Very addicting!,"Like a lot of others, I found this game very addicting. I also like that it's family friendly. My husband and I both enjoyed it as did our 2 older daughters. The 8 yr. old was able to get through a lot of levels, with patience and determination. The 6 year old enjoyed trying & improved a lot, but was frustrated by the levels with no walls. I think with more time, she would continue to improve, just like she has with other games, but we have to return it now.The only downside is that I don't know how long it would continue to be fun. I made it through all the levels, with trophies, & I don't know that I would continue to replay the same ones over & over."
5,Love it!!,I really enjoy playing this game!! The wi remote is very sensitive to your movements! some of the courses are tough. I have on made it to candy land so far. Let me tell you the graphics are wonderful!! I would love to have some of candy!! It is definitely a GREAT BUY!!
3,Harder than the other reviewers make it sound,"I rented this game and it can be very challenging. i got frustrated easily with it, and had to have my husband finish the game ( I played the first five levels and then let him have a turn and those five levels ended up being the only ones I beat. I tried some of the other levels, but could not finish. Maybe I'm just not much good with the wii remote and all the tilting, but I just wanted to let everyone know my experiences with it since all the other reviews say how easy it is.That being said, my husband was able to play through all of the original levels at least in 2-3 hours. Even though they were not really easy to get through, the board he did the worst on only took seven minutes."
5,Best yet!!,"Although very against another cover song... Erin continues to surprise all with anothe strong performance, and [awesome] vocals. Scott Anderson get's better and better!!"
2,Way too superfluous...,"Finally, another single from the amazing Erin Hamilton comes our way. Her muscled voice, sounding very assured here, is more than capable of carrying this R&B standard with finese and confidence; and from the sounds of it, the aggressive beat of her last outings is becoming her instrumental trademark. So my complaint is not with her reading at all, but with the lack of Erin that appears on this nearly 70 minute disc. Of the eight tracks here, five are dub mixes that reduce her vocal to mere percussive accents, making for superfluously extended (hence, boring) remix treatments. Van Cleave's remix--which includes Erin's full vocal-- is by far the best track here. Other's may have rivaled his work (Tony Estrada, specifically) had vocal versions been chosen for inclusion over basically instrumentals. After all, it is Erin's voice that drives this song so perfectly. Everything else is along for the ride."
2,Don't buy,Not a very good CD. Too slow and I just did not like the arrangements that is put together.
2,waste of money,"This book is a waste of money for the layman Dalmatian owner, no help at all with training. It is historical in focus, concentrating on past champions and historical bloodlines and statistics. All the more bizarre that the title page does not carry a date of publication nor of copyright. It might be of interest to a breeder of pure-bred Dalmatians once they nail down the date of publication from the publisher."
5,Great,This is a great book. It is completely full of information. It is a very good read indeed if interested in a dalmatian!
5,Cartridge,"The order process was easy to use, the item was delivered as expected in a few days and was without issue."
5,Shelter Valley Story,"Phyllis and Matt are both new professors at Monford University in Shelter Valley, Arizona. One day they are working on a project together when one thing leads to another and Phyllis finds herself in the family way. She tells Matt, but does not want or need anything from him. That is until she finds out that she is going to have twins.Matt decides that he wants to help her out with things that she can no longer do such as the cleaning and such. Phyllis also helps Matt with a student of his who is having personal problems. What happens next even Matt and Phyllis never would have expected."
4,Great little stapler!!!,"I bought the stapler several weeks ago to install insulation and 6 mil plastic in a 70 year old house I am remodeling. I have tried electic staplers, and save your money. I got tired of using a hand stapler so I did a little research and found this little jewel. Since buying it I have had several other people see it and want it. It would receive a five star rating except for the fact I don't like the double trigger. It makes it hard to staple. I just duct taped mine to the grip. Great tool, I don't know why I don't see more of them."
5,Just a great product . Does everything well...almost,"Nice and light. Well made. Takes off the shelf t50 staples. You can go for hours without cramping your hand. Staples get set perfectly 99.7% of the time. Just a joy to use. Used it to re-carpet my bunk boards on our boat trailer. Used 8 or so sets of staples (lots) without missing a beat.Only 2 minor complaints: Trigger lock stinks, but easily bypassed. No pressure safty trigger (have to press on the item before firing). You can fire into the air (Safty issue IMO), but not as bad as say, an air nailer. Just take your time, and you will be ok.Once you use an air stapler, you will not want to use your old style manual one ever again.I would give it 4.75 stars. It is a great value. There may be 'better' units, but the price is right, and the performance is there."
2,"Suzanne, Licensed Massage Therapist in Florida","With all the hype lately on this product, I can honestly say, I am not that impressed. I still prefer my Arbonne. Arbonne serum is by far a better product with a more immediate effect. I won't buy Aminogenesis again. I will stick to my arbonne."
3,"Interesting book, but not very substantial","I got this for my father, who works with locks at his job and then loves working with wood in his down time. He said that the book was very thorough in explanations for making the locks, but he hasn't yet made one. The locks are actually about 6 to 10 inches tall, which is a little bigger than I had thought, and the book was less substantial than I expected as well. But I think he was pleased with the book, and I hope he will be more so once he finishes a lock."
2,A Waste of Money,I wouldn't waste your money on this. The locks are scaled way to big. The designs are not easy to build.
3,Battery,It took longer to receive the battery than I was expected or was told but the battery works great. Put it right into the car and it started right up.
5,MMMmmmmmmmmm ..... Sour,"I love Altoids Sours, but the tangerine sours are the king. They rule. That's just the way it is. Buy these babies, and pucker."
1,Do not use it in the cold,Then first night it was great...then the temperature dropped to -20F and the mattress froze and cracked...it is useless with four inch splits in it...spent the rest of the trip sleeping on the floor.
3,Not what I expected,"This mattress was high quality, but the size was not what I expected. When inflated in the back of our Tahoe there were large gaps on either side, it didn't really come close to filling up the truck bed, although the length was good. It's pretty much a twin mattress that will fit one person."
3,"Good for one person, not two!","I threw this in the back of my Ford Ranger and headed up the Alcan... It was great for a night's sleep when it was just me. Never deflated.On the way back, with my teenaged daughter, it did NOT hold up.It says it can hold up to 600 lbs, but my daughter and I together are NOT even close to 600 lbs and it deflated on us. Next night, we reinflated, and woke up on the bed of the truck come morning.I highly recommend if it's for one person. If you need something for 2, don't bother."
5,Fits just right,Is really quite comfortable and is just the right size to camp out comfortably in the back of a Honda Element.
2,Awkward playing,"You can do much better for the Mendelssohn and Bruch. You may have to get them separately, but Isaac Stern does them much better. I find Ms. Chung's playing to be uneven, choppy and full of seams. The phrasing is not smooth. Her vibrato is also very sloppy in places. Frankly, having listened to several recordings of these two pieces over many years I would have to keep thesediscs out of the running entirely. I would recommend Stern orFrancescatti in the Bruch and Stern in the Mendelssohn. You getthe tops Tchaikovsky performance as well if you get Stern (with score cuts in overly repetitive measures)."
2,Out of control,"Kyung-Wha Chung tends to be too edgy, histrionic and out of control. She is just a nice violinist, not a good musician. That's why she can't try Mozart until now. I want her sound to be warmer and more controlled like Young-Uck Kim or David Oistrakh."
3,My mistake,Well I didn't like it. I was hopping a deep introduction to GIS but what i got was an introduction to ArcView Explorer. With this book you see the final result of a work but you don't know HOW they did it nor the basis that support it. You can find this information on the net without paying for it.
3,Beware of software glitches on the CD-Rom,"Received this tutorial today and imediately started on the lessons. Oops! There are two Glaring errors---so far--in the lesson plans. On page 49, when doing the Address Matcher exercise, an error appears: Cannot Build Geocoding Index. No way to get around it, unless you skip the rest of that lesson and move on. On page 75, at least on my home version of XP, cannot save the file to any format. Call to ESRI Support yielded little to no help at all. I only gave this rating a 3, because the overall lessons are great and it is something worth knowing, but the glitches dampen a bit of the enthusiasm. Hopefully, there wont' be any more on the CDRom."
5,A good place to start!,The book with the CD are very useful to learn the basics about ESRI GIS principles. I was looking for a book to help gain some insight into how GIS works; this fulfilled the need.
4,Great,"This tape is pretty good stuff. One of our windows doesn't have the best seal and let in a really nasty draft. I applied this tape to the window and the draft improved significantly. Will it work miracles and create an air tight seal that keeps out all of the cold air? Nope. But it helps quite a bit. It no longer feels like an open freezer behind our couch.The tape itself is very interesting. It's made of a thicker plastic. The only way I know how to describe the material is that it feels like those plastic decals you lick and slap on glass.As far as the adhesive goes, I think the stuff is pretty good. It's strong enough that it adheres to the window well, but not so strong that when you peel it off it takes paint with it or leaves residue behind.My one complaint is that there isn't very much tape. If it were a larger roll I probably would have tried it in every window in my house to see if it made a difference in my power bill."
4,Weather Sealing Tape,"If you have a few small places where warm air leaks out of your home in the winter, this tape serves as a temporary solution i.e. put it on in the fall - remove it in the spring. Simple as that. Used it around windows and felt like they were less drafty. Strictly for indoor use."
4,Does what it says,This product does what it says it will do. It stops drafts from coming in around your windows. It sticks under most conditions and leaves no residue when it's time to remove. It's also a pretty thick so no worries at removal time. This is the second year I've used this tape and feel it is well worth the small investment if you have older windows like I do.
4,great for nursery,I used this on my daughter's nursery windows during the winter time. That room was known to be the coldest in the house and with the tape it really helped keep the heat in and the cold out. I give it a four star because it did leave a tiny amount of sticky residue on the window once we took it off. Though I rather have a little residue than a cold nursery.
1,strong smell,"This has a strong chemical smell to it. I left it to air out overnight, but it didn't help. I'm tossing it out, since it's not worth the trouble to return."
1,do not buy this,"This is not the sealing tape it says it is. It is not sticky at all... I follwed all directions perfectly too. Regual tape is much stickier, so this was a total waste of my money. It is half fallen off already. I will never buy from this seller because of false advertisement! sad :("
1,It's Like Mailing Tape!,"I recently had an energy audit on my home. The auditor found that the weatherstripping on my patio door was worn out. I have a huge patio door, my entire patio basically runs the length of both my living room and dining room, about 8 feet long.I purchased this product thinking it would help to make my house less drafty, but this product is more like mailing tape, not any thicker, so to me if you buy this product you also need to buy some kind of covering or something to use this product with, otherwise it's kind of useless just using it alone.It seems like an expensive roll of tape, which is what it basically is. Now I need to buy some kind of weatherstripping foam, or something like that to use this tape with. I didn't read before purchasing this product that you also needed to buy something else, for it to be effective. Live and learn!"
3,"Informative, Interesting, Sometimes Dry","Most parts of this book were fascinating. I read this book to familiarize myself with Algeria's revolutionary changes during the mid 1900s. I'm planning to read collections of essays and novels about this subject in the near future, and I wanted a little background knowledge of the struggle of the Algerian people during this time period.This book did the job, but for a relatively small book, there were a few parts I found I had to force my way through. Still, it was quite informative and very interesting for the most part."
3,"Strident, but valuable.","Though I find his anticolonialist views a bit over-vitriolic at times, there's a very interesting piece entitled ""This is the Voice of Algeria."" It details how the radio went, in Algeria, from being a social embarassment (for Western integrated views on sexual morality and culture, as integrated into the programming were not appreciated) to being the life-giving source of information in just a few years. It also details the French government's attempts to curtail this cultural association by banning the sale of radios and even spare batteries. Moreover, a cautionary tale; though we think we are past censorial press licensing and such, the current restrictive policies on encryption software seem a similar attempt to prevent dissemination of the tools of speech and association."
1,"45 years after, what are the results?","The results of this glorious de-colonisation is that since the french have left --over 250.000 Algerians have died, women and children included, and the ones that can afford it all moved back to France,with the ""oppressors.""... While the Pieds Noirs have thrived wherever they have landed.PS: I am wondering if the authors of this book ever were in Algeria,I doubt it somehow?"
5,Exclusive Song,"I heard the song ""Chance Of A Lifetime"" performed by Gene Miller. But I can't seem to find that version anywhere on the internet. Is this song exclusive to the video only?"
2,Black Diamond gloves,"On the good side, these gloves are have a nice look, and I like the curved hand design, I also like the no-slip palm. The bad part is that they have tags and stitching and elastic that's exposed on the inside which makes sharp edges that rub on your hands and wrists. I consider that a serious design flaw, it's very uncomfortable."
3,Very rusted very quickly,"Okay, it works as it should, but I'm concerned with the rust. I kept my OEM Honda brake drums and may end up putting those back on since they were actually fine. (Didn't know that when I ordered these.) I worry the metal may rust to the point of failure, but hey, they stop the car."
4,Many easy to follow ideas,"The Mom's Guide to Family Finances is a very easy to read book. It's nice because it can be read quickly and the ideas are basic and easy to follow. I would say that if you have read the Woman's Guide to Family Finances I would skip this one. The information is too similar.I would recommend this book if you haven't read the Woman's Guide she wrote though. Many common sense, easy to follow ideas."
2,A Major Disappointment,"This is a poorly organized work that lacks for an atlas the purports to discuss Canadian military history, lacks Canadian context in many of the narratives and, worst of all, includes maps that are small and poorly drawn. Several key elements are glossed over or simply missed (for example, there is no map of Kosovo, although it is mentioned in the title). Unfortunately shoddy research and poor map design has robbed us of what should have been an important and very useful book."
4,Excellent one-of-a-kind book on Canada's war history,This book is an excellent reference with no equal in the volumes of Canadian military history.
3,Get more of the same elsewhere,"This recording looks to be the same as the first CD of the two contained inPanorama: Dances of the Renaissance, which is in itself a reissue of early Archiv LP albums. Take a look at those reviews to decide if you would enjoy this recording; but buy ""Panorama"" - for an additional $3.00 you get an additional CD of music.Also take note: a good chunk of this music - the Six Dances from Terpsichore, Dances Of Gaillardes from Musikalischer Tugendtspieler, and the Trio Dance Suites from Banchetto Musicale - was also released onFrom the Vault: Dance Music of the High Renaissance, a Boston Skyline CD (BSD 118) with seven additional tracks. The ""Panorama"" reissue includes all of this music as well."
5,What A Voice!,"This two-cd collection on Minnie is a great overview of her career! No need to go into how wonderful Minnie's voice is or her incredible range.... for those just getting in to her or long time fans(like myself)who have waited for years to have more Minnie available on CD, this collection a must have!!."
5,Minnie Lives Forever,"I agree with Boone from Little Rock. They need to re-release her ablum ""LOVE LIVES FOREVER"" (released 1980, Capital Records). I personally covit my own copy that is on vinyl. It was the greatest! ""I'm in Love Again"" duet with Hubert Laws is unbelievable. Stevie Wonder summed her up best, with his tribute to her on the album, quote: ""I miss you beacuse I cannot touch you..but then again, I guess that I can because you are touching me..so, Love Lives Forever""."
3,CAPOTIAL RECORDS HOLDIN UP MINNIE.,"THERE IS AN ALBUM THAT MINNIE WAS RECORDING THAT CAPOTIAL RECORDS REFUSES TO RELEASE ALL TOGETHER. THEY JUST PUT AFEW SONGS ON DIFFERENT GREATEST HITS, I LOVE,NEED,AND WANT THIS ALBUM, MINNIE WAS IN THE STUDIO RECORDING IT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY. THE NAME OF THIS ALBUM IS MINNIE RIPERTON:LOVE LIVES FOREVER,A COLLECTION OF BLOCKBUSTER DUETS WITH MICHAEL JACKSON,PEBO BRYSON,(ETC)IT WAS RELEASED THE SUMMER OF 79 OR 80. SOMEONE PLEASE PUT THIS ALBUM OUT THERE BECAUSE, THEY JAMED ON THIS ONE. REAL TRUE R&B!"
5,Difinitive and worthy,"This collection captures the feel and the many moods of Minnie Riperton. Although not totally arrainged in cronological order, you do go through the many sides of Minnie. From her version of Respect with the Rotary Connection to her first #1 hit Lovin' You. There are also alot of tunes from Adventures In Paradise and Stay in Love. Adventure's is one of my favorite CD's. The booklet is extensive and informative. I loved all the photoes, but would like to see more of this beautiful woman! The only thing odd in here is the discotized live version of Lovin' You recorded with George Benson. It just faded in and carried on in the middle of the song. What was wrong with releasing it in it's entirety? It was awesone, from what I heard! I would like to hear more live stuff, which I'm sure they have enough material. I would like to see a video, too! But for now...Buy this 2CD collection and savor the flavor and the beautiful, 5-octive and unique voice that Minnie left us with!"
5,Very worthwhile,"A good little addition to the dollhouse, especially the chairs. The chairs that come with the dollhouse always frustrated my toddler... they're just too small and the dolls always fell out. She also loves the puppy."
4,My First Dollhouse TV Room,"My daughter really seems to like this furniture set, especially the dog. Hard to find."
1,Haven't received this DVD,I was notified that this DVD was on backorder about 4 weeks ago so it is hard for me to rate the product. This was to be a Christmas gift but it is after Christmas now. I look forward to hopefully receiving it some time.
3,Unpopular View,"I have to agree with Stu (below) on this one. I'm a huge horror movie fan, even a zombie movie fan (I really liked 21 Days Later), but I honestly don't see why this movie is considered by so many to be one of the greatest of the genre.1) The special effects are not so special--in some cases you can actually see where the blue zombie makeup ends at the actors' necks!2) The acting is bad--really, porno movie bad, particularly in the first half of the film (though I admit it does get better in the second half).3) I get the social commentary (the zombies can't stay away from the shopping mall), but it only goes so far.All that being said, I don't think this movie is horrible. There are some decidedly scary scenes, and I think the story develops at a reasonable (albeit leisurely) pace. I just don't think it deserves ""classic"" status.I know this is not the popular viewpoint, but there it is."
1,Dawn of the Dead sucks,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot, dialogue, and special effects are all completely laughable. I did not get scared once during the movie and I laughed the entire movie because of how bad it was. I don't understand how people think this is a good movie."
1,AWFUL!!!,"This movie was soo gory! Not that I care that it's gory, it's just that the blood was more orangish yellow than red. The acting was weak and the special effects that everyone is raving about is pathetic. They even used the same dead people throughout the film that already got blown up!!My advice is to skip this cheesey horror flick."
3,Entertaining; interesting sub-plots; gorry special effects.,"Interesting sequal to a Classic horror film. The plot is well thought out and actually contains some interesting sub-plots (i.e. what would you do if a mall was all yours?). The special effects don't leave much to the imagination, if you love gore you'll love this! The use of bikers as bad guys got old in the early 70's. But overall a good sequal."
5,Zombie da best!,"As a kid in '79, it scared the bejesus out of me. It's dated now, but still a great movie. A solid 4 stars, with an added star for scaring Rob."
4,the best zombie film ever made!(almost),this is the best zombie film i hav ever seen(next to Fulcis zombi 2.Very good special effects by Tom Savini.
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!,"This was a great movie, good acting, the blood was a too bright to be realistic and the make-up for the zombies were pretty simple. But eventually it doesnt even matter, because as soon as they get to the mall it has you hooked. Usually I have a problem with movies that have slow walking zombies because its not scary, just walk pass them, thats it, running zombies thats something different. But in this, Romero did good job(of course) showing what they do in numbers, so I was cool with it. Tom Savini has a little role which was cool, overall great zombie movie!"
4,"Even Better Than ""Night""","So we started watching ALL of Romero's films. Dawn of the Dead is even better than Night because it's more sophisticated. I think it suffers from some of the same problems with drag and cheezyness. This movie could be at least 40 minutes shorter and there are major gaffes like distinct zombies that have been killed early in the movie appear again in mob scenes at the end, like the dead guy with the rifle and the nurse zombie. Also, some of the heros do incredibly stupid things. Rodger could have been bit (so he could turn into a zombie) without suddenly becoming an idiot. And what was the deal with the bandito jamming his arm into the bloodpressure machine and sitting there for his reading while zombies closed in all around him? I guess it was supposed to be funny.Despite all of these criticsms, though, Dawn of the Dead gets four stars from me for a lot of really spooky imagery, blood-pumping action, characters you want to root for, and originality."
5,"If you love Night of the Living Dead, see this now!!!","George Romero's sequel to the cult classic Night of the Living Dead lives up the hype. Low budget, lots of fun for everyone, and great zombie fu action (according to Joe Bob Briggs). You must see this and then watch Day of the Dead, the final movie in the series."
3,"Movie Is Great, But the DVD Isn't.","Anchor Bay DVD's have quickly become my least favorite DVD maker. Unfortunately most of my favorite movies are being released under them.The transfer is good, but either(a)this DVD was one of their first generation released DVD's or (b) they were just too lazy to fit the whole movie on one side and my biggest peeve...they didn't even have a running time programmed in.I have since seen them get better. Day Of The Dead actually has a running time."
3,good movie,if you like a gory film this is one that you should watch. there is good acting and some really good humor too.
5,THE VERY BEST EVER!!!!,VERY VERY VERY GOOD MUST SEE FOR ANY HORROR FAN MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME IT BLOWS AWAY ANY COMPUTER GENORATED STUFF ...CHECK IT OUT YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Finally A Sequel that can stand up too it's predecessor,"I think the first film is better. But this film isn't too far off. So often hollywood quickly makes brainless sequels that serve as nothing more than too make money off the popularity of the first. However, this film is an exception. It can stand on it's own. We take off from the first one. As at the end of the first one, we still believe we will triumph over the zombies. The plot of this movie is that two swat team members, a helicopter pilot, and a tv anchor decid too hole up in a mall...while trying too avoid the zombies. You grow attached to the charachters, and wish them well. This film ends up being a commentary on humanity, specifically greed. This is truly a great film. By the end we get the feeling that the zombies population is about the same as ours. We still hope that they will be beaten."
5,Can't Wait,"I must be honest, I almost got tricked into buying the DiviMax edition aswell, but after taking a look at what features it had on it and hearing rumours about this four-disc edition, I decided not to bother. All in all by looking at the cover art and reading about what will be on it, I believe that this edition will be a great buy for the month of September and for any Dead fan out there and, hopefully it will be the last edition for this particular movie. I can just see it now, six months from now, brand new ""SIX DISC"" Special Edition, that would be quite a sight ."
5,A Classic Film Updated,"I'm not going to go in depth as many people already have.All I'm going to say is that if your a Zombie movie fan,and you have yet to see this, Buy it now. You will notbe disappointed. This is by far my favorite Zombiemovie of all time, and I enjoy just as much now asthe first time I watched it. It's got everythingyou could want. zombie's, gore, humor, action,horror, story, and plenty more. It's niceto see it in Hd as well.There are a bunch a special features includingcommentary, behind the scenes, the making of, andmore.Like I said earlier. Buy this movie now, andyou won't be disappointed."
4,Moral Dilemma,This is a great film. The subject of widespread societal panic and the potential for anarchy among the masses has always been attractive to me and this movie delivers (think New Orleans). the film is scary and gory and over the top but it is also a biting social critique. Brainless Zombies wandering around the mall beacuse it makes them feel safe. It sounds like the mall near my house! It's great. It reminds me of Grand Theft Auto. You go into the mall and can pretty much murder the public at will. A rifle shot to the head being the most gratifying. The shear bliss of having the entire mall and all of if its treaures to yourself. Looting and killing. It's so liberating.
4,Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition) review,"They finally did it! Everyone has been waiting for a great DVD release of perhaps one of the Greatest movies of all time. Now it's here. It truly is an Ultimate Edition. If you have been waiting for the perfect edition of Dawn of the Dead This is it. Even if you own all the other editions on DVD, VHS, or Laser you need to pick the one up. You will be happy that you did."
5,"The ultimate movie in the "" DEAD "" trilogy","Dawn of the Dead is the ultimate living dead movie in the George Romero's trilogy. The movie picks up three weeks after the events of Night of the Living Dead. The world is now slowly being taken over by zombies, but the living still can't get over their own differences. Fighting for survival four people board a helicopter and flee the cities, hoping to outrun the dead. In the process they run into an abondoned mall. At first they stay only to get supplies but decide to make it home for a while. Soon they face the unrelenting zombies advance and begin to wonder if they are some of the last people left alive. A masterful movie that grips the soul and captures the imagination. It shows the dark side of man and his cruelties to one another."
3,The film that started the gore trend,"Dawn of the Dead, not The Exorcist, is truly the film that started the outrageous gore that permeates so many horror movies these days. Well, that's not to say that Dawn of the Dead is bad, as a matter of fact it's a good film if you can stand the rather poor special effects, mediocre acting, and the elevator music. Dawn was in its time the goriest film in cinematic history, equalled by Zombie a year later. George Romero outdid himself seven years later in 1985 with Day of the Dead which was definitely much grosser than Dawn. Those two films stand as two of the best zombie films. If you've never see Dawn of the Dead before, you should probably ingnore my three star review. I just had a major problem with the production design of the film. If you enjoy horror films with a lot meaning and satire, you should watch Dawn of the Dead at least one. Warning: It may take more than one viewing to like this film. Personally, I think first impressions are rather important"
4,Goriest film ever!,"This film does not deseve a 4-star rating. But as a horror film it does. If you like blood, guts, gore and all that good stuff, rent or buy this because you will love it. This film is about zombies invading the earth, and a few people get away in a helicopter and settle in a zombie infested mall. Excellent special effects (especially for 1978)!"
5,The greatest zombie movie ever made,"I remeber first seeing this movie on tv quite a few years ago. The film got me interested in the whole zomie movie genra, and after seeing many more zombie movies since this still remains the best example. The idea to film most the the movie in a mall was inspirational. Although the acting is a tad woodern it still stands up a a great film. Some of my friend won't even watch it because its a zombie movie. They don't know what a great film they have missed."
5,Golden Age Jewel,"Boy this film sure can upset some people... :)I was fortunate enough to see this movie at the cinema when it was released. It was unbelievable! To those too young to have seen it in the theater you dont know what you missed! Also, cgi was non-existent (thank god) the FX were real makeup effects and clever editing. The true talent of Romero's vision and Savini's excellent gore effects.. created a plethora of wannabes... Hence the term the golden age of gore. To people used to MTV editing and CGI effects this film may seem slow.In its day this movie shocked and freaked out many a viewer, Hail to the King of Zombie movies.. George A. Romero!I cant wait for this to arrive at my house!D"
4,Scary is an understatement.,It scared me when I was a little kid and I'm equally horrified to this day. Dawn of the Dead is just creepy. Zombie movies just have that extra something that makes you shiver.
4,Watch out...,"Hey all, if you are thinking of buying this DVD...DONT!!!Just wait for the big disk collection coming out soon. I actually thought this DVD was the directors cut..it's not. Don't be fooled. I got the real directors cut on VHS a long time ago and it was UNCUT. But this dvd, is known as the directors cut but it is NOT!!! it has scenes missing. Still watchible, but if I were you, I'd wait for the big set to come out with this version, the TRUE DIRECTORS CUT,the dario version, and DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD. You will thank me."
5,there is no more room in HELL and the Dead walk the earth,"I am a big zombie movie fan. I've seen and own the best. Night of the living Dead, Day of the Dead, Resident Evil, House of the Dead, and the Return of the Living Dead triogy. But the one movie I have not yet seen is The Dawn of the Dead. I have searched contless stores and websites and have not found one. The one I did find was 129.98!!! My subsitute teacher once told me about it and now I must own it to finish my set. I intend to have the orginal DVD set and the re-make DVD set. As I speak this film is going to be pre-ordered so I will become master of the Living DEAD."
3,GREAT COMMENTARY,"I am a big fan of this film and of Romero's work Anchor Bay has again managed to pick my pocket with yet another bare bones edition of this great movie, for the price (cheap only 13.00) a die-hard fan will relish the superb commentary( Thanx to Perry Martin) by George his wife Chris Romero and the special effects king Tom Savini. If you can wait the deluxe edition comes out in September, Oh please put Document of the dead on this edition.:-)"
5,I must agree with evildead01,"This is a great movie on its own merit; why create a remake which, while it will surely have superior special effects, is almost certain to be infoerior without the creative genius of Romero behind it? This disturbing trend of remaking horror movies, and updating them with a bunch of lame hip characters and cheesy soundtracks a la the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre with teenybopper Jessica Biehl, is very annoying. Remaster and re-release this classic to the theatres instead. But since they are not going to do that, be sure and check out this DVD, the movie is one of the great pieces of horror of all time."
4,4.5 OUT 5=BEST ZOMBIE MOVIE PERIOD,"Dawn Of The Dead is the mother of all zombie movies,even italian directors that copy with imitators like(HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD,NIGHTMARE CITY,CITY OF THE DEAD)and so on can not come close to this masterpiece. To bad this movie is out of print on DVD,but I heard they are releasing in a box set with better sound and picture quality than this version. I can't wait!!"
3,"Good, though Very Over rated Zombie Flick","From National Film Critics to us humble Amazon posters, this movie is treated like the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror films. It isn't, though it is pretty good. The not so subtle message of all Americans in our consumer society being zombies is hammered home ad nauseum at the expense of suspense. Romero's decision to eject most of the terrific score by Dario Argento regulars ""Goblin"" and subsitute bland public doman ""muzak"" is no help either. Pluses for this film are solid acting, good make-up and a sense of humor. Minuses, in addition to those previously mentioned, are slack pacing and awkward diologue.NOTE: This film was re-edited by Argento (one of the producers of Dawn) under the title ""Zombies"" (not to be Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie""). That version also has most of the Goblin score cut out of this version and, happily, is also available on DVD. Though missing Romero's humor, this version is the preferable one to get and rates four stars in my book>"
5,A great if not better sequel,Watch this and and NOTLD if you love zombie films Dawn Of The Dead is a masterpiece of one great music plot gore everything you want in a zombie film this has it!STAY AWAY FROM DAY OF THE DEAD IT IS A HUGE LET DOWN FROM NOTLD AND DOTD! ( MY OPINION )
1,Dawn Of the Dead.,"Well, For some Gore counts as Horror, Especially Canablism Cheap Gore and Zombies to round off this so-called classic, nothing impressive, except body parts falling.Not what I would describe horror but much more Shock value and what generally is wrong with people."
1,Make up you mind when the movie come out,DAmm no 3 of themDawn of the Dead -- U.S. Theatrical Cut (1979Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)Dawn of the Dead: The Original Director's Cuti bought the Divimax Edition so i guess i got rip because when i but the dvd i thought i was going to get every thing that i miss out but i guess i have to buy all three of them what a rip. greedy
4,A zombie film definitely worth seeing.,"Zombies are overrunning the world, and four survivors take refuge in a mall. George A. Romero's highly popular and quite lengthy zombie tale features several flaws, which include a cheesy musical score, weak acting from Gaylen Ross, and the occasional bit of shoddiness in the make-up department. Still, this is highly recommended material, thanks to the numerous carnage-filled action sequences (particularly the beginning and the finale)(and I swear, you'll never see a movie with more bloody gunshots to the head!), the mostly effective satire and emphasis on characterization, and a terrific lead performance from Ken Foree."
5,A Brilliant Movie,"This well-crafted, brilliantly directed and addictive movie. has changed the face of horror, it is with out a doubt the best zombie movie ever made. It is definetly worth buying, I'm proud to have it in my collection. END"
5,Nice to have package!,"For fans of Romero's '... of the Dead' series this is a must have! All the versions of 'Dawn of the Dead' in one box, plus a cool documentary disc. Tastefully packaged and topped with some nice extra's."
4,Dawn of the Dead,"What can I say, this basically started the Zombie film genre. I recommend thisas a starter movie for any George Romero fan."
5,An essential purchase.,"""Ultimate"" sums this item up perfectly.You get three versions of the film, each with commentary. These are featured on discs 1-3.Disc four contains additional supplements. For me, one of the more interesting is the home moviesrecorded by one of the extras. He captures George Romero setting up shots, and make-up artist Tom Saviniwhipping up zombie effects.Another great extra is a tour of the mall where the film was shot. Ken Foree, who played one of the SWAT teammembers, leads a group of fans through various shooting locations.The discs are housed in an attractive slipcase with minimal artwork. I highly recommend this item for any hardcorezombie fan. You will not be disappointed."
4,Another classic by Romero.,"A great sequel to Night of the Living Dead. It's not as good as Night, but it's still a classic. This time a bunch of people is hiding in a shopping mall that's eventually invaded by zombies and a biker gang. Romeros cut is a bit too long and drags down the pace, but since the film is so good it's forgiven."
4,Great Movie Very Scary But a little corny!,This movie had a great plot and for the most part is well made. One thing that i noticed was that How the zombies killed people was very unreal. They where like ripping peoples guts OUT! and ripping people apart. Everything looked Very Fake and the Way the zombies Ripped out the Peoples Guts was not even .....I mean they did it with ease! But if you want a bloody Scary action movie DAWN OF THE DEAD IS IT!
5,The best horror movie ever!,"No horror movie ever made can touch this one. Unlike Night of the Living Dead, this belated sequel is quite funny in places, but it doesn't spare the viewer the jolts and the fear that its predecessor provided.Probably the most brilliant thing about this film is that you never know how to react to the zombies. One moment you're laughing at them, the next moment you're feeling sorry for them, the next moment you're disgusted with them, the next moment you're terrified by them, and the next moment you're laughing at them again.Great performances by no-name actors, a terrific script and fantastic direction make this a unique experience. I doubt that any horror film will EVER top it."
4,..still miss something,"Picture is just great, sound is good. What I don't unstand, is the fact that there's now more of the scene with the false Policemen. But they appear suddenly, and nobody knows where they came from. Despite that it's still a good and scary deal!"
5,BEST EVER,"I HAVE ONLY SEEN ABOUT 4 OR 5 ZOMBIE FLICKS AND I THINK THAT DAWN OF THE DEAD IS THE BEST! IT'S THE COOLEST,THE GREATEST,THE TITANIC OF ZOMBIE FILMS! THE GREATEST!"
5,When the dead walk the earth,"This film is not for everyone. Those true film buffs would appreciate George Romero's early film styles for depicting gore in subjective ways. This will truly be remembered as a classic ""art-house"" film of its time."
3,"Worth seeing, but not Romero's best","If you want to see Tom Savini dish up gore, you'll get much more viscera for your buck with the (to my mind) under-rated ""Day of the Dead"". If you want a satire on consumerism, watch ""American Psycho"". (The admittedly great line about why the zombies come to the mall - ""It was an important place in their lives"" - is about as trenchant as Romero's satire gets.) And if you want real haunt-your-nightmares zombie chills, nothing has ever come remotely close to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".But ""Dawn"" is worth watching for its great premise and skillful direction, even though it's half an hour too long (the condition now known as ""Tarantino-itis"") and undercuts its effectiveness with silliness like having bikers attack the zombies with cream pies. In particular, the end credits - though not half as powerful as those in the first film - are memorably creepy.(The DVD extras are just as paltry as everyone says and should not be an added incentive to purchase.)"
2,Lacking compared to the hype...,"This film lacked to live up to the hype that surrounds it. While the film did have a lot of good zombie death scenes, it lacked the plot of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". I wish the character interactions had more depth and a better explanation of the power supply for the mall existed.WARNING, SPOILER: The bikers at the climax of the film were what rubbed me the wrong way most of all; trained military personal fell before a hoard of zombies but random bikers lived and thrived just fine? I don't think so..."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Zombie-czar George A Romero delivers one of the best all-around horror movies ever made in Dawn of the Dead, a film which combines solid characterization, skillful direction, and sly social commentary with exploding heads, severed arms, and buckets of blood."
3,"apocolypse, Zombie Style.","you've already read all of the reviews that explain the story, so here is the good and the bad. this movie is depressing in a insightful way. watching these particular zombies are like watching senile or sick family members/friends because they are treated not as ""fiends from the grave"" but rather like dangerous real people. this really makes the claustrophobia seem all the more intense. good gore effects. good (but not great) music. lots of different settings for such a low budget movie. interesting characters and some really excellent and unique conflicts. the bad-this movie is really long, too long for this short-tempered zombie fan. Not a classic, but respectable."
2,I'm so disappointed....,"It's probably unfair of me to criticize a movie nearly thirty years after it was made, but I only just now saw it for the first time and I'm sorely disappointed. I guess I'm one of these people who likes the remakes more than the origianls. I found that the acting stinks, the action is corny, and the special effects seemed bad even for 1978. The caracters seem to be living in this mall for a few weeks, and I felt like I was watching the film for a few weeks. It just seemed to drag and drag with nothing really happening. I knew I wasn't being overly critical of the film once I saw the scene where this biker gang starts smashing pies and spraying seltzer water into the faces of the zombies. I guess I'm just spoiled by todays makeup and special effects and CGI, but I'd recommend the NEW version of Dawn before this one."
1,How does this movie get 5 star reviews?,"Honestly, I am usually a big fan of horror movies, but this movie was a real let down for me. The makeup was dull, plot was boring and the action is low (if any) to get to be a 5 star movie. I watched it twice just to give it another shot and I had a hard time staying awake both times. I thought the remake was way better and I usually like originals better so that tells you something."
1,What!,Two words can express this movie it is absolutely terrible. People said that this movie was great. well i bought this Movie last night. It is worse that the house of the dead movie. The movie isn't even scary. The movie takes place in one place the whole movie. In a deserted shopping mall. Trust me dont even rent this movie. It sucks.-The Movie Guy
1,"Oh, PLEASE","I gave the remake GLOWING accolades. Someone in a chatroom (I should have known not to listen!) said that the original was much better. So I waltzed over to Circuit City and purchased this. Sigh. I'll NEVER get that $35.00 back. I feel so bad for having purchased this. This movie was not scary. The zombies were not scary. The characters were completely insipid. Perhaps I wouldn't have felt cheated if I'd watched the original before the remake, but had I watched THIS drivel first I wouldn't have WANTED to see the remake--or anything else remotely connected to the movie. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the remake, which I had to watch 10 times before it no longer scared me at all. But this--I don't get it. It wasn't even REMOTELY close to the remake. How does it get so many positive reviews?"
1,An insult to horror/B rated movies.,"This movie is horrible. When I say horrible, I mean, I'd rather be sexually molesting Celine Dion horrible. Well, perhaps not that bad, but still. I have never turned off a movie halfway through before but this one made me do it. The acting is horrible, the plotline is basic if even existant, and the special effects are... well, lets just say it's 1978. I love B films. Cheesy horror cult films are totally sweet. However, this one is just bad. It was a waste of 2 hours. The basic ""plot"" is that zombies have taken over the world apparently. (of course they give no background to the story) These four people keep running around in a mall for some reason. The black dude paints the walls. I'm so pissed I saw this movie. I'm gunna go gouge my eyes out now."
4,Quality,"First off, this is not, I repeat: NOT the extended cut of the film. Why? i don't know. Possibly to steal more money from us later on.But none the less, it's quality. Great HD picture and fantastic sound."
5,damn great film,"I have seen this movie nearly 25 times, and it has never lost its luster. this films social criticism is probably my favorite aspect of this movie. its great to think about ""what would i do if everyone i knew and love suddenly was my enemy?"" and ""where would i go and what could i do?"". personally i would curl up in the corner and allow myself to be consumed by my dead grandmother or something. it allows us a look into true human nature and really makes you think...plus the gore is great! did i mention that? no? well its great! i think dawn of the dead has to be my favorite out of the Dead series. oh yeah, buy it. you wont be dissapointed...but i would wait until that 3-disc special edition set comes out if i were you. its one of my favorite movies, but its not worth 100 bones."
5,THE zombie movie!,"Wow, what a movie! I settled down late last night to watch this classic for the first time, and was highly impressed. The gore effects are brilliant, and it's also very funny. Personally i found none of it scary or particulary freaky, mainly because the makeup for the zombies isn't that good, and obviously low budget. The average zombie is basically covered in blue face paint wearing a torn bloody shirt. However somehow it makes the film better.Get it."
1,I must not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie,"Judging from the huge pileup of 5-star reviews, I must not have what it takes to appreciate this film.I have no problem whatsoever with zombie movies. I've watched and enjoyed many of them. Dawn of the Dead is a horrible movie. One of the worst I have ever seen.The dialog is ludicrous. The actors are utterly unconvincing. The plot is absurd. The special effects are laughable (even for its time).The makeup was the high spot and it wasn't all that great.There were way too many shots of the dead wandering around. Cut them out, and this movie would be better (and 30 merciful minutes shorter).I am an extraordinarily patient movie consumer, but sitting through this was excruciating. There isn't a friend, enemy, or total stranger to whom I would recommend this film."
1,Even worse than the first offers nothing.,In this one we see zombies everwhere ripping and tearing and eating flesh in fact the exccessive gore is the only thing new this one offers. Once again a band of humans stupidly barracade themselves this time in a shopping mall. And live their untill some bikers break in letting in the dead thus leading to the inevietible and preditible ending.Do your self a favor if you have not seen this don't waste your time or money. Watch Karloff's Frankenstein or any of the Universal monster classics instead.
2,A Dated Gorefest,"I once viewed DAWN OF THE DEAD as something of a masterpiece when I first viewed it in the mid-80s. Having viewed this film again recently with the release of the director's cut, I have to say that this one doesn't really stand up that well. In fact, it looks rather dated. Romero's intelligence shines through in the above-average script and characterizations, but it's all the then-trendy 70s/80s gore effects that badly date the film. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini did wonders on a low budget, but the makup fx are so gaudy and over the top that they look rather cheesy. Every time the story gets interesting, there's a slew of garish gore effects that had me groaning and chuckling to myself, with the result that the film overall is uninvolving. This was once terrifying, and is now a cheesy chuckle. See the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD for a genuine exercise in how to build fear on a low budget."
4,It's a good movie,This movie is pretty good but before i bought it my brother told me that it was very gory!!!! But when i got it it wasnt as scary and gory as i thought. Actually at some parts in the movie were just plain boring. I haven't seen the directors cut but it is probably better than the U.S. therical version. At some parts of the movie were good like the part when the gang of bikers go in the mall and the zombies rip that guys stomach open that was pretty cool. But if you haven't seen this yet i suggest you should buy the directors cut.
4,When There's No More Room In Hell...,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a great film no matter how you look it. Good characters, and Goblin's music is awesome. For those of you yet to see the remake, keep a sharp eye open for a pleasant little surprise of Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger."
5,This Movie Kicks Major Donkey A$$,"I Love this movie no matter where you put it. Trust me. I've must of seen it at least 500. Literally. People say that the music is corny and the zombies look horrible. But Tell me the truth, the first time you hear the gong song during the credits it didnt stick in your head for 15 min, in stuck in your head for 3 days. And the zombies look like regular Joe's and i think if was any other way it would be trash. In my opinion, it gives it a whole comedic look. Thats why i love this movie.---Pimp Master Funk."
4,NUDITY? Where did that come from?,"I first saw this film 15 years ago. It was the first tape I ever rented and I still get a kick out of watching it today. After buying it on tape 2 different times,the second with a bogus promise of being a Directers Cut, I'm happy to say the DVD version is actually that. Although why did Romero delete the groovy Goblin music in the opening TV station sequence? And after seeing this movie many, many times, it's the first time I noticed that Gayleen Ross is showing her breasts when she's sitting up in bed after her ""romantic evening"" with Flyboy. DVD clarity strikes again. But I have to say, there is something a little spookier about watching this film on a worn out VHS. Savini's effects look better when diffused. I doubt this film ever looked this sharp, even in the best movie theatre in Pittsburgh."
2,Death of the DVD,"First off, the movie didn't hold up to how I remembered it. But if you're considering buying the DVD, chances are you love the movie. So I am not going to review it. But I was disappointed in the DVD itself. The back cover says ""5.1 Surround"" but there is nothing here. I even got up and put a different DVD in my player to be sure my rear and left and right speakers were working.I didn't expect start of the art sound, but saying ""5.1 Surround"" on the back cover is an total lie! If you have a good quality video version of this movie, the DVD will not be any better."
5,Wonderfully great,This was a terrific way to follow its predecessor and this one keeps you sweating and begging for more straight up to the end. Beautiful gory effects highlight this perfect zombie flick. Again a classic from George Romero. Thanks you George!
4,If you like zombies then watch!,"Dawn of the Dead is simply a good zombie film. The suspense is not extreme, but it is present. You do want to keep watching to see how everything will turn out.The setting is a neat idea and the characters show what can happen when everyone does not work together as part of a team in the zombie-fighting realm.If you like zombie flicks, this is a classic!"
4,One of the most original horror movies ever,"The world population has been infected by a disease that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Four humans have decided to escape the plague by escaping in a helicopter. They end up landing at a zombie infested shopping mall and its up to them to use the proper survival tatics to stay alive. This is actually a horror movie with a plot, not just some gore loaded splatter movie. Even if your not a horror movie fan, this one might actually appeal to you, because it has a dramatic mood to it. Its actually horror mixed with adventure and drama. Written and Directed by George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead)."
5,Best of the Dead Trilogy!,George does it again. Could we see a 4th movie? DOD Is the best zombie flick of all time. Love the touch of humor in this flick (pie fight)Please check it out!
3,don't spend your money on- director's cut,"buy the cheaper, original dawn of the dead! director's cut?---bull!"
3,Average.,I don't know.... It has a great plot & has millions of emotional moments.But it's too bloody. It never will match it's original.
3,Okay movie but it's extremely outdated,"I watched the director's cut version of Dawn of the Dead. This film's story is pretty good, but its technicalties are bad. The music, for example. It sounds too cheerful at times and that prevents us from feeling scared. The blood also looked like orange rather than red. None of the characters in the movie ever looked really terrified. The zombies also look very fake. For dead people those zombie's flesh should be rotting. It's basically a bunch of people wearing white makeup that doesn't even completely cover their face. All in all, this movie is better than the average horror film, but it is outdated. Hopefully, George Romero's Resident Evil will have realistic looking zombies with better music and a darker and scarier atmosphere than Dawn of the Dead."
5,Nice Unofficial Prequel.,"I love this prequel and its better than its counterpart unofficial sequel Zombie 2!!!The legendary Zombie Master George Romero has created a most intensely shocking motion-picture of all time, Dawn of the Dead. And special guest starring Tom Savini the gang leader with his gang of bikers.I give this 5/5.But, to all those people love to bash this film and us lovers of this film, we don't want and don't need to hear your nagging on us loving this film and calling us narrow-minded, I think you guys are the ones who are narrow-minded, posting all these things to bash us are simply downright: childish, insane and narrow-minded. Looks like the harsh words you all had made on this film and on us fans probably has backfired on yourselves. So quit your childishness and peace out."
5,Bards for the king,"These guys did more with less on this album. The lyrics have intergrity. The beat rocks and the acoustic tracks are insightful. Not as polished as the first two albums, that's what makes this so complete. A true pursuit of excellence that reveal a love for an excellent Savior."
5,The Poets On Top Again,"On their first two albums The Smalltown Poets just sang christian pop-rock music but this time, with their newest album, Third Verse, it expresses their feelings of love and God with catchy rock tunes."
4,"Upbeat, acustic songs..Great as always!","Smalltown poets have done a great job from the start. Everyone cheered when 40 Acres were fresh off the burner, but when Third Verse hit the shelf, what a smash! Smalltown Poets don't go for the 80's synth., but the clear cut melodies with great procusion. Definately a good buy right off, I recommend it!"
2,Good when it works,"I bought this nailer back in October of 2004 and since the the first day of use there has been nothing but trouble. It jammed on me many times before I realized it needed to be lubricated several times throughout the days time. It is now January and I went to use it on another job and it just didn't work at all, it is now in for service and I hope the warranty will cover the problems."
1,Junk,I could not find the dimensions of this board when I bought it. I figured for the price I would just check it out. It is very small and very cheaply made. My friends laugh at it all the time. I stuck it on the dart board case and it has yet to be used becuase it is such a peice of crap. When I got it in the small package I should have just returned it then. Very small and cheaply made. I feel as if I almost got scammed. JUNK JUNK JUNK do not buy
4,Adam's Best,"First, I should say this is a wonderful cd. The sound, the playing and the directing are great. Eschenbach is one of the greatest: I have seen him directing Mahler's 1st and he can really get something new from any composition.Adam's Violin Concert is one of my favourites. I was deeply shocked the firt time I listened to it and I still am every time I play it on my stereo. What's more,this is maybe the best choice, even better than the Nonesuch. However, I thing the coupling is not up to it. Glass concert is much more boring, much more ""new age"" and I think it doesn't match here. Some people say they are similar, but I think they do not have anything in common. This is my reason for the 4 stars. If you like Glass music, then it would be a 5."
3,"Excellent humidifier, if you can stand the GLUG.",While this is fine product that has a very quiet motor I must comment on the glug sound made as water flows from the tanks to the resevoir. It occurs about every 20 minutes and will wake all but the soundest sleeper. It actually startles you awake as it sounds as if someone is hammering in your backyard. ( I understand this is a protective airlock feature).I looked back at the prior 40+ reviews on this product and unfortunately discounted the reviews of others who had this problem. Though a bargain at $60 can not reccomend you purchase this unless you sleep like a log.
2,Very Loud Knocking ...not gurgling sound,"Having read all the previous reviews on this humidifier I decided to disregard the comments about disturbing sounds from the humidifier. I am sorry I did. The tank construction is so flimsy that when water is released into the wick tank (more than once an hour (depends on the amount of humidification)a very LOUD knocking sound (5-7 bangs at a time)will disturb your sleep. I thought the next door neighbor was doing construction next door, I couldnt believe this was actually coming from the humidifier. Seriously, I was only one step away from going over there and waking them up at 230 am. I wish I had bought the ultrasonic types. If you have hard water..prepare to clean the wicks often as they absorb them, discolor and turn hard. I can't complain about the basic function..the unit humidifies well but even after almost a month I cannot get used to hearing the banging sounds."
5,"smart design, great product","This is an amazingly well designed and effective humidifier. I swear it is keeping me from getting sick this season. I have used three humidifiers in as many years and this is a keeper. It is quiet, easy to fill without soaking yourself or the floor, and it is easy to keep clean and bacteria free because the electronic parts can be completely separated from the sections that hold water. I have never written a review before and really don't have the time to now, but this is such a great product I had to pass on the word."
3,"Good, but it goes glug glug glug","I bought this humidifier because it was reviewed as being quiet and because Vornado makes great fans and heaters. It does work well, and the fan is very quiet. However, as it evaporates the water, it tends to make a very loud glug glug glug noise, which never fails to wake me up. I even moved it out of the bedroom and into the hall, but it is still very loud."
3,Worth A Try....Perhaps,"My wife and I have used this humidifier for four years now and now, as I shop for a better product, I thought I should contribute to the comments listed here about it. Four years is quite a while so that says something in itself. We have used it every night. However, I'm really tired of spending ten bucks (plus shipping & handling) every two months on replacement wicks. The frame's a bit flimsy but durable and the gurgling noise of water draining into the tray has never really bothered us. I now believe that I'd prefer to spend a little extra time involved in cleaning, say, the Holmes 5700, than purchasing those damn wicks, which have now costed far more than the humidifier itself."
3,goes through a lot of wicks,"Works pretty well and is very easy to use, clean, and refill. The tanks are big and perhaps just as important, very sturdy. I refill each tank in a large (kitchen) sink. Probably won't fit well in a typical bathroom sink though.Lately, I have noticed that we are replacing filters more than once a month, but for what it is worth, I am running the humidifier around the clock on the low fan setting. A pair of filters runs about $10 at Bed Bath & Beyond."
3,"Good capacity, but has faults","I bought this humidifier to replace a smaller one in a relatively large bedroom. The fan is quiet on the low an medium settings, and I hardly notice the sound of the water coming out of the tanks. It throws out a lot of water, depending on the weather of course.On the minus side, the tanks are relatively opaque, so it's hard to tell how much water is left by sight. Also, the fan keeps on running when the water runs out--unlike my former humidifier. Also, don't expect to fill the large tanks in a typical bathroom sink. They require a large sink or bathtub to fill."
4,Vornado HU1-0013-11 Standard 4-Gallon Vortex Humidifier,I like this product so much I recently purchased a second unit. It is quiet and easy to use.
4,Simple to use and maintain,"Possibly a little small for our very large new bedroom, but the unit still makes a difference and does it fairly quietly. Too soon to tell how long the filters will last but the company's filter replacement program is very convenient and reasonably priced. Refilling is pretty easy as well."
3,average,This humidifier would be greatly improved if it had a humidity gauge like my other one does. Otherwise it works well and is not noisy.
4,Excellent product.,"Easy to maintain, delivers about 4 gallons of water in 24 hours. Best for one room, not many."
3,Vornado HU1-0013-11 Standard 4.2-Gallon Vortex Humidifier,"I needed a strong and easy to use/maintain humidifier for my bedroom. I did have to stop using it because of the glugging noise. I would say not the best for bedroom unless you're a heavy sleeper. Also, the humidy level is hard to tweak. I'd say it's not accurate. If you're buying to humidify a large room or whole apartment, it's probably great."
5,Super Quiet!,"I've gone through a lot of humidifiers, and finally found a winner with this one. It is super quiet, even when the water flows down to the pan it doesn't do that loud gurgling that some do. The large capacity is great, and its easy to fill. I like that I set the humidistat and it takes care of itself and I don't have to worry about it getting swampy in my house. This is a total winner, only thing I don't like is that I have a hard time finding replacement wicks locally, but I order them here and they are actually reasonably priced compared to some other humidifiers."
2,Mold problems,"The tanks are easy to fill. The unit works, the controls are simple. The machine is easy to take apart.That said, I have the following problem with it. To avoid mold buildup on the wicks (filters) I have to run these (I have two) with very little water in the tanks so that it will run dry and dry out. The only alternative to this is to pull all the wicks every few days and soak in water and vinegar.I was much happier with the Bionaire humidifiers I had a couple houses ago."
4,Best of the Bunch!,"Great humidifier! Better than Holmes, Honeywell, Vicks, Bionaire, even Venta ... models we bought and returned immediately because of loud operating noise. The Vornado fan is super quiet (our #1 concern) and runs on a humidistat, which most units don't. And the large water tank capacity means you have to refill less often than similar sized humidifiers. Cleaning and wick replacement is a breeze. The only downside is a glugging sound produced every 30 minutes or so as water moves from the bottle to the wick bath (e.g. soda poured from a 2-litre bottle). However, the airlock is a design necessity and we'd take the quiet fan and simple design over the occassional glugging any day. In fact, every day!"
5,A Super Humidifier!!,"I purchased this humidifier a few weeks ago. I was at first hesitant to order it based on some previous reviews which complained about the loud knocking of the water in the tanks and the overall noise the humidifier genererates. However, I have found neither of these concerns to be a problem at all. On the contrary, the humidifier is ""super quiet"" and the ""gurgling"" is not much of an annoyance; acutually, it is hard to hear. I wholeheartedly recommend this item. An added plus, this humidifier uses considerably less electricity than other manufacturer brands!"
1,Vornado 4.2 Gallon Humidifier,"Very satisfied with the purchase of this humidifier. Quiet opperation, maintenance, ease of assembly, capacity and performance to date makes this an excellent choice."
5,Top of the Line,"This is the best personal humidifier on the budget market. Vornado gets it right with wicks that are standardized across the entire product line. The bottles are easy to fill, don't spill, and designed so the water doesn't go stagnant. The humidifier keeps running even in humid conditions to prevent the wicks from molding. Good stuff."
3,Requires frequent filter changes!,"At first, this humidifier worked like a charm. I have an indoor hygrometer (measures humidity), and the humidifier kept the lower level of our house at around 40-45% humidity during the winter...quite comfortable.However, after several weeks, I noticed the humidity levels dropping. I also noticed that I rarely had to refill the jugs of water. Turns out, we have hard water, and we have to replace the filters every several weeks. The filters aren't cheap so this is a problem!A couple other complaints...1) Since this is an evaporative humidifier, it cools the house down. Our heating bills are high enough as is, so the release of cool air inside doesn't help matters.2) There is definitely a ""glug"" sound every 15 minutes or so which can be a little annoying."
2,OK but Some Problems,"I've had this humidifier, among others, for 3-4 years. First, the humidistat is a useless gimmick. I have three hygrometers to guage the effectiveness of Vornado's ""humidistat."" It does not shut off when satsfactory humidity is reached. Second, the wicks grow mold rapidly (30 days), although they're supposedly treated. Third, there is no reliable way to thoroughly clean the water tanks. You can't get inside to wipe them down. If you have allergies, as I do, the wicks and water tanks present significant problems."
1,No reception,I purchased this radio after buying 2 cheaper Sony's neither of which picked up my favorite radio stations. I live in a medium size city and there are only about a dozen radio stations available. This radio picks up 2-3 of them. I'm returning it. Is there any personal radio out there w/decent reception??
1,misrepresented product,The product stated it was digital and the customer servive representive stated it would receive the digital tv signals which it does not.I called the company and the representive said it would be at least a year before the tv band will be availible. They should put a disclaimer in their ad that states after 2/17/09 the tv band will no longer work.Misleading product information and they would not pay for my shipping fees.
1,Overated and poor reliability,My first issue with the Sangean DT-210V is that the reception is no better than the $10 Sony I purchased back in 2000. My second is that after only a few months of use my DT-210V no longer works. My $10 Sony still does. Too bad my old Sony doesn't have digital tuning.
2,Good radio but defective,"Sound and quality are really great but after 1 month of use the display has stopped functionong. Therefore, I don't know what channel I am on or what channel I am tuning to."
4,Favorite Radio,"I really like this radio, it has great sound and I like the digital feature, is easy to tune, has great reception ability, the only problem is after about 1 year the power button malfunctions and I have to get a new one, but I figure for the price and convenience of it it is worth it to get a new one as I have not found any other portables I like. I especially like that it turns itself off after 90 min as I usually listen to it at night when I can't sleep, otherwise it would be on all night. I wish it had some sort of small light in the dial so I could see in the dark. I will keep using this radio as long as they make it."
1,Not the one for me,I needed a radio I could use to pickup a weak station next to a stong one. This one keep switching between stations. I returned it.
1,Don't buy!!,"Unless you ALSO buy large quantities of stock in the Ever-Ready battery company. This radio uses up batteries at astronomical speeds!My previous Sangean was fine UNTIL the volume stuck on highest level & could no longer adjust sound. I am an AVID radio listener, but, I see it's time to change Brands....."
2,"Good features, but unreliable!","This radio has a number of great features, but the reliability definitely needs improvement. In less than a year, the display stopped functioning. The person for whom I purchased this radio then received another of this exact same model as a gift following the demise of the first. Now, within only 2 months the volume dial stopped working on the new radio! There are a number of cheaper options that are much more durable, such as the Sony models. For the price, the cheap build quality is inexcusable."
3,Sangean DT-210 Disappointed Owner,"I had owned another Sangean Digital AM/FM pocket size radio about the same size as the DT-210. Before I bought the DT-210 I read up on its capabilities and liked what was said about bringing in FM stations clearer. However, this model doesn't bring in some of the stations that I thought it would, especially at night (in the AM band). Also, station strength depended on where in the house I carried the DT-210! Another thing I don't like is the little button on the back right top. It can be moved easily without intention of doing so. For the price I expected better performance."
2,Buy a Sony,"The power button broke 4 months after I bought it-- a month after the warranty expired. So, obviously I'm pretty p.o.'d right now. I've been using Sony sports tv/radio products for many, many years and I'm going to go back to that quality manufacturing. I only tried Sangean (after my Sony SRF-M80V finally died) because I saw the reviews that said it pulled in AM stations really well. In actuality, it didn't perform any better at reception than my Sony."
4,This little radio is fantastic,"This little radio is great, it is clear and gets good reception. The only complaint I have is that their was no electrical adaptor and I need a battery change every week. I get to hear Regis, Rachael, Whoopi, and Oprah now every day."
4,Radio receiver,This radio does what it claims to be able to do. Fidelity is good and it pulls in the stations. Moderately easy to set up.
5,"Expensive, but worth it","I've used a half dozen pocket radios on my morning walks, and this is the best by far. A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. I use it for FM stations exclusively, and have never needed the external antenna.Some have complained about the effort required to scroll through pre-set stations, but once you get the hang of it, that's not a problem."
4,Great reception..clear sound,Reception and sound is great with the ear buds in. The external speaker is not great but how good do you expect it to be? Makes a great take along for sporting events. Would recommend.
5,Bucky the Book Dude,All of the features are easy to use and reception is great. I can honestly say that I am extemely pleased with this purchase.
2,Great Reception???? I don't agree!,"Very disappointed with this product. I bought this radio based on all the reviews claiming great reception. I bike ride quite a bit and use a portable radio to pass the time. I found this radio to get average to poor reception and I am very unimpressed. Based on the price tag on this one, I do not feel it is not worth the money.I am returning this one and I will stick with Sony from now on!"
1,have not recd item,I am unable to determine where said item is . We have not lived at that address for three years. I contacted the supplier to cancel the order and was told by the contact person that the order had not been shipped and that he would cancel same. The charge just showed up on my credit card bill. The credit card co issued new cards in early Sept. Please advise.Ref:Order #102-4154588-9429722Thank you for any help you can give me.Paul W.

1,What's wrong with this picture?,"I never heard of anything that calls itself a TV that doesn't have a picture. The little screen tells you what station you are on and I could hear Oprah talking, but that's all there is: Sound and no picture. The sound wasn't even that clear.So that's why the ad didn't mention whether it was black and white or color (color seemed far fetched but with LCD screens it seemed possible) and it seemed remarkable that you would be able to see much on such a little screen, but in these high tech days and at such a good price it seemed worth a try.This is probably for people who want to listen to televised games while working and wouldn't be able to look at the screen anyway."
4,Great Little Radio,"I had a Radio Shack radio that I listened to for the past few years. It went out, so I ordered the Sangean 210 and it blows away that old Radio Shack radio. I'm able to recieve all three bands (AM/FM/TV) very clear. Would highly recommend this radio!"
1,Save your Dough,"I recieved this radio a few days ago and at first thought it was worth the price. If you try to raise the sound any higher than half volume it starts to sound scratchy. You have to move the radio around a bit to get a good reception, and the anntenna is annoying just hanging their like a piece of loose string on a shirt. I accidently dropped the radio from a hight of 2 feet, then I had to say ""Goodbye to my $50 investment. Piece of junk. It should be able to withstand a drop test of about 3 feet, at least. Save your money folks."
1,"Poor reliability, died in less than a year","Good form factor and features, but both TV and FM bands died in 9 months-and only a 90 day warranty. Never again, Sangean."
3,Sangean DT-210... just OK,"After using the Sangean DT400 for a couple years while working (it finally gave up after I dropped it into a mud puddle), I purchased this radio as it is small enough to fit into a jeans back pocket, has a digital tuner, has a button lock switch, and I didn't need the weather band function of the DT400.In general I like the radio, but I was disappointed that it doesn't have a clock display when it is turned off (the DT400 has this feature). In addition, setting the station memory is a little cumbersome and the button lock switch is in an unusual place on the radio.Overall, decent sound from the speaker (I mostly tune to AM talk/sports radio stations) and I like the size. A decent radio for how I'm using it, but I may go back to the DT400."
2,Disappointed,"Within 5 minutes of trying out my new toy, I was disappointed. I could not pull in more than 3 FM stations and I didn't even bother with the AM band. Thinking that I have too much interference within my house, I took it on a road trip to work with me and still didn't get any reception. After getting the chance to play around with this I also feel that it's very overpriced and you're paying for the Sangean name and nothing more. I have their table radio that is awsome so I figured that their portable would be just as good. I will be returning this item and maybe I'll try the $10 Sony that was very highly rated. For 10 bucks it's worth a try."
4,Will wait and buy it again,"The previous models worked very well for me. I believe the good comments from previous reviews about this new model. The truth is that you can not find another radio with such many good features on the market.However this new radio does not power on, no sound, no display. The radio has a very good design of style. I returned it. I will buy it again in a few months when the manufacture weeds out the infant mortality defect."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with this radio. At a cost of almost $50, I would have expected much better quality. This radio had very poor reception and sound quality on AM and FM. I purchased this product based on other very positive reviews, but they must have been talking about a different radio product. This was a cheap give away toy. I ended up returning it for my money back."
2,Expensive radio should preform better,This radio should preform better for being close to $50. I'm 50 miles from Detroit and 30 miles from Toledo and most nights I only receive static. I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for a radio to draw in distant stations if you live in a more rural area.
2,Headset radio,"Sangean radio. So far I like it very much. The sound quality is excellent, as is the base enhancement feature. I'm learning slowly to set the memory function. So far, so good! I tend to be technologically challenged, but am persistent!Frances VandervoortChicago"
3,Hopeful,"I was hopeful this radio would provide me with good reception and sound quality since I was not receiving that from a recently purchased Sony walkman. Great sound quality when I was able to tune into a station. Unfortunately, the poor reception and static prompted me to return the product."
4,Review after 3 years,"Well, I have had this radio for over 3 years and it has held up well. But, then again, I don't work in a construction site environment. I use it at home and the office. Yes the sound is better through the headphones, but the speaker is good for background. I mostly use this for am talk radio and I am satisfied with the quality of sound and the build.However, a few weeks ago I dropped this radio on the floor and it hit the power button on it's way down. This broke the micro-switch under the power button cover from the main circuit board. I opened up the case and found the micro-switch. Very small, but I was able to carefully solder the tiny switch to the circuit board. I assembled it back together and it works great. Most of you should not try this at home unless you are familiar with electronics as there are no user serviceable parts inside (HA!).Yes, I would recommend this radio and would buy another one if it was lost or stolen."
5,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I purchased my third Sangean radio model DT-210 recently.These radios have great FM reception. My FM sports show is a fairly weak dignal with old Sony and it is much improved with the Sangean, but the MAIN reason for this review is to compliment Sangean on their excellent customer service. I lost the swivel clip at my gym last week. I checked lost and found several days and called Sangean. They asked no questions, took my name and address and within 3 days I had a new clip. I am so impressed with this as well as their excellent product."
4,Meets my needs very well!,"I needed a very small portable FM receiver that could bring in relatively weak stations and this device met my needs admirably. Other units that I've tried with external antennas are bulkier, heavier, logistically clumsy, and don't have this ones excellent reception. The sound quality is good and I like having a speaker, though my primary use is through headphones. The true digital tuning is excellent - my prior unit had analog tuning (with a digital display) which kept slipping off the correct frequency. It's hard to find ""just a radio"" - I have an IPOD and don't need YAMP3P. For my needs, it would be nice if this one had a connection for a neck lanyard, but other than that it's fantastic."
3,RF Tuner problem,"on my DT-210V I note a problem with the RF Tuner in the AM band: WKZO is locally 590 khz but I can only tune the radio to 594 or 585 resulting in less than good reception. the tuner need a manual single step advance so that after it stops off frequency like this i can advance it manually, 1khz per click to get it right on frequency1 star is lost for the rf tuner problem and a second for two minor things which really are not the fault of the kit, but: (a) it needs better ear-phones, and (b) it should have an NIST clock display that would show 10 seconds after you set frequency, and (c) the controls are difficult to work intuitively,-- you can easter-egg them bu they are fussy particuarly in setting the pre-sets."
5,Very happy with my purchase,"This radio is easy to use right out of the box. It has very good reception, sound and is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. The earphones are ""OK"". Funny thing, I purchased about 4 pairs of earphones and the only one I really liked are the ones that came with my IPOD. They provide excellent bass without the expense of sacraficing the mids and highs. I would have liked a back light on the screen. Other than that, its a great radio."
4,sangean radio,"The best portable pocket radio I have ever owned. Granted the only others I have used were cheap, convenience store radios, but this one does not even compare to those. I did not think it would matter that much, but I can use this radio in closed areas, under bridges and in basements of old brick buildings with almost no degradation of signal reception. I am so pleased with this radio. The next test will be long term. I will have to see if it puts up with the abuse of my very physical job, the heat, the water, and the metal shavings which have affected all of my other electronic devises. Unfortunately, it is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. But that is still yet to be seen so I should not be pessimistic. Great radio so far!"
3,Radio Review,"I like the radio the clarity is good,however the ear buds broke within a week after using it. I purchased a another pair of ear buds and I am still enjoying the radio.I would purchase this item again"
1,Worthless After Only 18 Months,"This was my second DT-210. It lasted only 18 months before the channel selection buttons quit working. The first radio lasted 4 years before it started having problems with the channel selection buttons. It, however, at least still works in one direction. The newest one doesn't work at all. Another problem with the first one is that the volume dial has quit working, and now the radio only plays at the highest level. If you're looking for a reliable radio, I don't recommend this one. I really regret the fact that I took a chance and bought a second one."
5,Greatest pocket radio of all time,"I'm a radioholic. This is the best pocket radio I've ever had. The reception is excellent, even for stations that other radios have trouble bringing in clearly. The sound is crisp and clear for such a small speaker. I had found it difficult in my area to clearly pick up one of my favorite AM stations, especially at night. This radio brings it in like the tower is next door. If you're looking for a great pocket radio, you won't be disappointed by this one."
4,The Best Portable AM/FM/TV Around,"My Sony radio/TV audio broke after only a year and I was looking to order another one but decided to see what other radio/TV portables were out there. The Sangean DT-210 won much praise, while some cited similar problems with their Sony. I decided not to put myself in a position to be fooled twice and purchased the Sangean instead. I'm willing to try most things once! Well, what a wonderful surprise to discover that the Sangean lived up to its name! Reception was better as well as length of use on two batteries. I like the swivel belt clip which keeps the radio from being jammed off when getting into the car. The speaker option is a plus when it's necessary to be able to hear other things around you. The only thing I miss are the preset buttons that take you straight to the station rather than having to scan through all of those you have programmed in. But all in all, I feel I have a better radio/TV and am very satisfied with it."
3,Have to wait and see,"My radio arrived and seemed to work right out of the box, but within a couple hours it basically quit working. It powers on and the display shows the stations but there is no sound through the speaker or earphones. It seems like a nice unit but I guess I'm going to have to return it for warranty service. Kind of a bummer."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"I purchased the Sangean DT-210v based on the favorable reviews on Amazon.com. What I got was a worthless piece of junk. First, the earpieces are the size of megaphones. Unless your ears are the size of caves, the fit is so ergonomically uncomfortable there is no way you can wear them for any extended period of listening. I had to use my iPod earbuds, instead. The AM band is totally worthless. In the AM band, this radio can only pickup some local stations in my area (Sacramento) At best, the reception of these local stations is weak and statically distorted. My primary reason to buy this pocket radio is for listening to AM talk radio and sports. The radio does a better job on the FM and TV bands. Reception of local stations on these bands is adequate. Well, what can I expect from a $43 radio, right? I'm still shopping for a good pocket radio with strong AM reception. Any recommendations?"
3,Nice Radio - AM reception issues,"I purchased this radio so I could listen to AM radio on my ride into San Francisco on BART. The first thing I discovered was that the BART trains must create too much interference for the radio to pick up any AM radio stations, FM stations come in pretty clear however. My second disappointment is that I can not get any AM signal in my office building in the financial district either.I think the little radio just doesn't have enough resources in the AM radio side of it to do what I would like. I might be asking too much of it.I like the digital tuner and the interface is quite nice. It just isn't doing the job I would like. I will go back to my MP3 player with digital FM tuner.I hope this helps."
3,A pretty face,"Looks great, feels great, but couldn't pull in FM public radio stations from my workplace or home in Seattle. Reception in Seattle can be tough and reading other reviews I thought this radio could do it. Wrong. I couldn't tell that it could pull in stations any better than any small portable radio. But it sure is good looking!"
4,Over rated in other reviews,It does what it should and that is about it. AM gives you no better reception than other portables. FM reception is good and I like the lock switch. Presets are not intuitive.
3,Too Much Hype,"I bought this radio on account of all the positive reviews. Because of this, I had my hopes way up that this radio would perform incredibly well, similar to the phenomenal radio in my mom's Buick Le Sabre. When I received the radio and tried it out, I was disappointed to find out that the FM reception was pretty pathetic. Stations closest to me over power quite a few of the weaker ones. On the AM band, reception is disappointing during the daytime. At night, the reception is really good. I picked up a station from Atlanta, and I live near Toronto. I wouldn't recommend this radio. If I could find a portable radio as good as the radio in my mom's Buick, I would be willing to pay big coin for it. But not for the one reviewed here."
1,Poor quality control in manufacturing.,"Ear bud jack defective on original order and on replacement unit.Great AM reception, may not work on FM.Not recommend at this time!"
3,Sangean AM-FM Radio,"Overall rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars.I really thought I was purchasing a portable HD radio. (At least that is what I entered in amazon.com's ""SEARCH"" window.) It isn't HD.All in all it's a pretty good little radio.I STILL haven't figured out how to insert the hard, plastic belt hook.]It fits in my shirt pocket.Sound quality: pretty good. [I prefer AM band.]The ear buds' wire length is ample for the way I prefer using/wearing them: I put the radio in a coat pocket (or in the shirt pocket) and the wire is on the back of my head, with the bud inserted in the right ear.The ear buds are a little on the ""handle-w/-tender-loving-care"" side. I make do with only one bud.Respectfully & Honestly submitted.VTY,RoninPA"
1,DISAPPOINTED,This radio sits in my husbands drawer because the reception is non existent! A total waste of money and we should have returned.
3,It's okay- so far.,"PROS: price, digital tuning, compact sizeCONS: cheap feel, narrow base (easily knocked down)I received the radio on 3/26/10.The radio has a very cheap ""feel"" to it. I am very careful with it because past reviews have indicated that the power button tends to fail. However, I have not had any problems. The reception is good, not great. I receive most FM stations, but AM is useless. I use it in my office, which is in the center of the building and has not windows. Also, the slightest vibration will knock it down."
1,Sangean radio worked 2 weeks.,The radio is very small but is not very loud. IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER TWO WEEKS.
3,Somewhat disasppointed,"I was hoping to use the DT-210 to listen to hard to receive radio stations on FM and AM that my car radio can receive but small portables seem to have difficulty with. Low band FM 88.1 in my area could not be received clearly. Some AM stations same problem. Overall many stations can be received, however I was hoping to be able to listen to the same stations I can get on my primary audio receiver in the den or my car radio. Sound quality through the tiny speaker is terrible, through the earphones it is awesome, so if you are planning to use earphones this will not be an issue, if you plan to use the built in speaker, prepare to be disappointed."
4,Excellent for the ballgame!,I was looking for new radio to take with me to the ballgame and this one is more than I expected. The AM reception is excellent and the size works well. The lock feature really helps avoid accidental tuning. A great radio anytime you are out and about!
2,power shut off,the recently purchased radio will shut itself off spontaneously without any movement of the instrument. Noticed others with the same problem. What a nuisance!!!!
4,"Does the job, priced right","The Sangean DT-210 performs nicely. Sound is good, not spectacular. But that is fine for me as most of my listening is NPR as I perform maintainance (painting, carpentry, etc.) on our property. The locking function is very helpful. The FM reception is as good as any other table top unit we have. In other words, distant stations are received with some difficulty in some locations. You will find yourself flipping the ear bud cord/antenna to improve reception. Battery life is surprisingly good - using for a month now on the originals. Belt clip arrangement works just fine. In a perfect world, it would be blue toothed (floppy cord is irritating) and have wi-fi to pick up my Pandora stations when the news gets too depressing! But for the price, I would recommend it."
2,Not pleased with performance.,"I got this to replace my tuners in my car and in my house. I wanted to just plug the headphone output directly into the amplifiers like I do with my iPod. Reception has been an issue when I tried this with hardware before. I tried an mp3 player/fm radio, and some fm tuner/remote for the iPod. Neither could pick up my favorite radio station at all. It's a college station in Atlanta, WRAS 88.5. The mp3 player didn't even tune that low.So I had big hopes for this radio, but they were dashed once I got it. The station came in okay inside; not good, but at least I could hear it. However there was no reception in the car.Another thing I didn't like was that the output spiked when turning it on or off, which was loudly audible through my speakers when it was connected to the amps.This radio has worked for many people, as evidenced by the other reviews. However, I had to return it."
4,Great little radio with only one flaw,"I had the previous version of this radio and left it in a hotel room. After trying a Radio Shack product, I got tired of using up batteries so fast and bought the DT-210V.It is easy on the two AAA batteries and has a 90-min cutoff, which is good for me because I like to listen to late night chatter and tend to fall asleep.My only problem, a somewhat minor one, is that the scan buttons are too close together and if I want to jump from one preset station to another, the same scan buttons have to be activated by another switch, located at the top on the right hand side. This is awkward, especially in bed in the dark.It also draws in distant stations better than my Radio Shack radio (which cost about the same)."
5,Great little pocket radio,I enjoy this radio frequently when I am out. It has great sound and I dropped it several times and it still is working perfectly. I like to listen to news and talk radio so this in a sense is a substitute for an ipod. Good quality.
5,Radio for football games,"I bought the Sangean DT-210V radio to listen to the football play-by-play broadcast on the AM band at Dolphin games. The reception is great, and the sound quality exceeds my expectations. My previous radio had alot of reception problems and scratchy sound. This radio is a big improvement."
4,Sangean DT-210V AM/FM/TV,The radio works very well on the AM band in a metal building. Sound is clear and the Deep Bass is excellent.The belt clip is cheap and you must be careful not to release the radio as it will fall.(I taped mine so it would not release). Great reception and I would have given it 5 stars other than the cheap belt clip. Buy it.
4,Sangean Radio Purchase,Very pleased with radio. Gets pretty good reception at my offce where's it's mostly used. Would recommend this product to others!
4,Nice radio - ear buds could be better.,"Radio may have better than average reception. The ear buds are very cheap. The volume control is hard to adjust, and is too small. It costs more than a similar Sony portable, but it may be worth it. We will see how long it lasts."
2,Failed within days-,"Goodbye Sangean after 3 days when the tempermental power switch ceased to work at all. Replaced Sangean with the unit cited which meets my needs and has impressively easy presets and operates for days on only one AAA cell. Less expensive, solider feel, didn't need TV band or speaker features anyway.Sony Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black)"
2,did not live up to the hype,Read reviews and was impressed with am receptivity and use of external speaker. Main use is to listen to ballgames on my patio.The radio am reception was worse than 20 yr old ge I had hoped to replace and speaker was simply horrible except for stongest stations. This product was returned.
1,stupid,"Everything is fine about the radio except one major flaw. The presets don't allow you any ease of use. Each time you want to use the preset you have to hit ""recall"". The whole purpose of this radio for me is to surf quickly from one set station to another. This is unacceptable. It is a shame because the radio is excellent in every way otherwise."
2,Lots of static.,I wanted to listen to an FM radio at work. I work in a cubicle around a lot of computers. This device did not perform well. I have an MP3 player that I have been using but was looking for something with a longer battery life. This did not work out for me at all.
5,Sangean DT-210 Review,"This pocket receiver is exactly what I was looking for. I do lots of walking and when doing so, I like to be able to listen to FM radio stations. This product provides outstanding sound and has great range. I needed something small enough to fit in a pocket or on my belt and this can do either. It's extremely easy to use."
2,Pre-set stations require 2 steps,"I ordered this radio to replace my Sony Walkman radio. I think I will return it. It was very easy to set the pre-set stations but the way to recall a pre-set station has an extra step.After you set your stations you must hit a recall button on the side of the radio and then hit the Tune up or Tune down button to get to your station. On my Sony you could justhit one button and would go right to your stations. This was only a problem to me because I use it when running and I don't want to be looking down to find the right buttons.Also, I listen to it at night when I can't sleep and in the dark it was hard to find the buttons.I also found some of the stations that came in fine on my Sony did not come in as well on the Sangean unless I moved it around. I did like the smaller size but the recall of the Pre-sets ruined it for me."
2,I should'nt have...,"I wish I was writing a glowing review... I am not. There is a durability issue other wise the warranty would be longer then 90 days. Mine like others suffered permanent failure after about 6 months. The power button no longer functions - very weak plastic and poor design. It did pull in most stations but the antenna reception wasn't the greatest, I had to move the radio around frequently to get a clearer signal. It looks like the designers were more worried about how many features they could advertise vs the actual quality... not recommended."
3,TV band gone after Feb 2009 DTV conversion,"Product works great for TV band! Great TV reception within my office building. Rough reception for regular radio stations. Unfortunately, I do not believe any of the TV band radios will work after the DTV conversion in Feb of 2009."
3,station memory faulty,Nice radio for sound and quality but very difficult to program and set favorite stations. I read and re-read the instructions word for word but it doesn't work. I was going to send it back but it's too much trouble. I'll either put up with it or get anoter brand.
1,"Like many other people, my radio won't turn on anymore","The power button on the radio died.I never pushed hard on the button or exposed it to moisture. I think that the button is poor quality and after a certain number of uses it just stops working.My radio will not turn on now, and it is past the 90 day warranty.Read the reviews of the other people that gave it a one-star rating. Many of them have the same problem."
5,fine product,Thanks for your service. The radio worked wonderful for my purpose I bought it. It received signals very good. I would recommend this radio.
3,Ok,"It didn't get as great reception ice as I would have liked, I was hoping to have my husband use this while he was at work so he could listen to AM radio, but it doesn't get very good reception in his building."
4,Loss of TV band reception,I purchased this radio two months ago and it has been wonderful. It has been great for listening to my favorite TV station but that is gone now. Is there any fix for the digital TV change or will there be new technology in the near future?
2,"I Might""ve Liked It","I ordered this for the bathroom to keep up with the weather while brushing my teeth in the morning. Wonderfully small, like a deck of cards. Exactly what I was looking for, BUT it did not work all the time! It would cut out after 2 or 3 seconds, or not work at all, so returned it (with ease, full refund, and no problems) and ordered the same manufacturer, but the analog version. Same size, similar look and I really like it. I'm sure I would've liked this one, too, if it had worked properly."
1,Pass on this one...,"I compared many items online looking for a portable FM tuner which I have come to rely on with my Nokia phone while dog walking every day. I bought this to take the place of my new phone without an FM tuner. Very disappointed in the sound, size, ability to lock in stations, nothing comes in on TV tuner at all, and the buttons to move to favorite stations are goofy. If this was a $25 item I would say it is worth it but not at this price. After I bought it, I was at Target and saw many options that were actually MP3 Players with FM tuners that would have worked as well for less money even though I don't own any music to download! Live & Learn. No complaints about the vendor that sold it to me though, they had the best price out there."
4,Great reception,"Unlike every other walkman-sized radio I've tried, this one manages to receive WUSF or WMNF from Tampa without some local station splattering all over it. Much better than my Sony Walkman SRF-M37V. The tuning presets are non-intuitive, otherwise I'd five-star it. I don't want to have to learn something. The Sony has an intuitive interface, the Sangean, not so much. Bottom line is, my wife wants to listen to ""Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me"" at the gym on Saturday morning. She's not going to switch stations. The Sangean cuts it. The Sony doesn't."
5,Great Radio,This radio really gets the am radio stations well which is what I wanted. I listen to talk radio and only care about am. I am having trouble making the stations stay on the programmed buttons when the radio is turned off so I have to dial each one manually.
4,Exceeded My Expectations,"Periodically, I must sit 4+ hours for a necessary appointment located in a multi-story structure. Because I enjoy listening to AM radio, I'd been taking the only digital tuning portable that I had, an AIWA. With that unit, I needed to sit in a particular area in order to marginally receive one of two stations to which I listen. With the Sangean DT-210V and sitting in the same area as well as farther away, I'm able to receive multiple AM stations in addition to all of the VHS stations in my area. While there is some periodic static associated with the AM listening, it is not overly intrusive. It is certainly a huge improvement over what I was tolerating previously which included `resorting' to FM when no AM station could be received. For reception capabilities, I gave five stars, but deducted one for the steps needed to utilize the presets, a minor nuisance."
1,Sangean Pocket Radio,This product has been a disappointment from the start. The channel selected is not the channel the radio receives for example when tuned to FM 94.5 the channel received is 101.2. I called Datavision and was connected to someone that could care less. He said to send it to the manufacturer which I did. The radio came back with the same problem. I had to pay for shipping plus an additional six dollars with no results. I won't be buying from either company in the future.
1,What a disappointment,Bought this for my son for Christmas. On DAY TWO the antenna system broke. Now it won't pick up a single channel -- and he lives in a city of 2+ million people. A huge disappointment.
1,What am I doing wrong or is this a piece of junk?,"It dies and needs new batteries within 8 hours or less. It blows my mind.I read the instruction manual over and over trying to fix the problem, thinking maybe I'm leaving it turned on somehow.I'm not!I see some of you love the unit. Any advice?"
3,Sangean DT-210,This radio was listed as an HD radio but it is not. As a standard Am/FM pocket sized radio it performs well. It comes equipped with a set of ear buds that are adequate for walking or other light exercise.
4,Digital volume would be better,"The Sangean DT-210V works very well indoors where I need to use it the most. Strong reception for both FM and AM. My only dislike about the unit is that the volume control is an analog wheel, instead of a digital button like the rest of the controls. It's too easy to bump when in a pocket, and can't be locked."
4,Rosemary skewers,The rosemary skewers added flavor to the chicken pieces and looked kind of fancy. They are kind of messy though. The rosemary needles are everywhere. I first heard about them on the Biggest Loser show. They used them in a recipe. I could not find them anywhere in my city (Reno area)which surprised me because I live in a large enough city. I liked them and will order them again.
4,A great start,"Kate MacLeod made an impressive start with her first album, 'Trying to Get It Right'. I prefer 'Constant Emotion' but this cd has all the right elements. As her music matures I just found those elements come together a little better. Still this is still a CD you should have if you like folk-rock-pop. MacLeod does it with the best of them."
5,nlp made easy,"A great book with short chapters about 10-25 pages. It contains almost everything, what you could need if you'rebeginning your studies on the field of natural language processing, computational linguistics or if you're are just interested in it. Easy to understand and to use. Recommended reading for students! Level: intermediate"
4,Works,"Got this for my truck. Tape was useless after 4 days in Florida heat. Decided to go ahead and remount using 3 self taping screws, since I foresee that we will always have a need to hold a phone/GPS. Once screwed in place holder is excellent. Hols my Atrix2 with otterbox case, or my Garmin. One less star than perfect because the foam side holders are not adhering to the arms and had to reglue them."
1,Not for anyone out of high school!,"I was thoroughly disappointed. The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery! When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also! VERY BAD! I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out!"
4,Not as good as previous versions,"I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP. It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user."
2,Not as good as it stated,"This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word."
1,Software Scam,"I purchased this software in July of 2011 but didn't have a chance to install it until I received my new laptop, this January. When I did a complete install, the program wouldn't accept the code printed on the inside of the plastic disc carrier. I contacted the vendor directly and they insisted that my disc was not valid. They would not help me to remedy the problem. It will be a cold day before I ever use any of their products again."
1,the worst software ever,"I recently purchased a new computer. The dictionary/thesaurus software I had been using for several years did not work very well with the new computerand windows 7. I had been looking for something new and updated; I thought the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus would be a good choice and Amazon as usual offered a good price. I was wrong on my choice of software. I spent over four hours trying to get it loaded and getting it to work. I have twenty-five years with computers, both at work and at home; I have never experienced this much trouble with any other software in the past fifth-teen years. After four hours of total frustration I gave up, called Amazon and complained. The Amazon representative was quick to arrange for a return of the product and a credit for my purchase. Merriam-Webster gets a one star, only because that is the lowest offered; Amazon.com gets five stars for not adding further to the problem. Thank you Amazon.com."
3,"Work Adequately on the Mac, Could be Improved","I'm typing this on a Powerbook G4 running Mac OS X 10.3, according to the top utility, the Merriam-Webster application is taking between 7% and 12% of the CPU time while idling in the background. If every application I owned did this, I would be in trouble. Thankfully, most commercial applications are better written.Not that I don't appreciate the product for what it does. It is incredibly useful for looking up words, solving crossword puzzles and the like. I know I use it frequently and think it a bargain.However, as a Mac coder, I find its interface and performance well below professional standards. It is easily the ugliest application I use on a daily basis with its mixture of faux 3D elements and Mac native widgets, its garish color scheme, blocky icons and its tendency to suck down cycles as if its programmers had never heard of a Carbon Event."
2,Poorly designed screen functions,"Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era. They are laborious and clumsy. To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered. Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!! Maria McGowan"
2,"Good basic reference, lousy interface.","The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful. Software companies got away with this years ago, but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces (e.g keyboard short cuts are missing). Integration with Word 2003 is weak. Numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow."
2,not up-to-date with the print edition,"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate is the standard for many of us in magazine and book editing. Beware, if you expect to receive an up-to-date rendition of it on disk. I bought the printed Eleventh Edition a couple of months ago, then bought the disk version earlier this week because I thought it would expedite my word checks while editing onscreen. For most needs, this certainly is ample (although I don't like the awkwardness imposed in switching between dictionary and thesaurus). Although the disk box claims it to be the ""Eleventh Edition of America's #1 Dictionary,"" I believe it's four or five years out of date already. Certainly the printed Eleventh Edition which I received contains terms not yet included in this product. Quick test: Look up ""blog"" in the print edition; it's defined there, as you would expect from the latest version of any dictionary. See what happens when you type that word into your ""new"" disk version.[...]"
5,Good shoe protection,"These are a good choice for those looking to protect shoes. My first pair lasted four or five years before the rubber tore. The heel comes up a little higher than on some overshoes, giving a bit more protection in puddles or snow. Rubber significantly improves traction on ice, compared to hard-soled shoes.My first pair seemed a little small, so I went with an extra large, but that was a mistake--they're really big. I guess the lesson is to follow the sizing recommendations given on the website."
2,New design is 'way too big,"For several years I had used the size small over my workboots with no problem. This year Tingley made them ""wider, longer, bigger"" and now they don't fit well at all. They flop around so much that they're noisy and may be dangerous due to sliding around on my boots. Had they also created an Extra Small size, they would still be worthwhile. I won't buy them again."
4,They do the job,"Bought these for my husband. Muck was ruining his expensive steel toe work boots. After reading the reviews, I ordered a size larger than needed. He said they go on easily and they appear to do what they're supposed to do. Can't ask for more than that."
1,wore out in just over month,"had overshoes just over month and used maybe 10-12 days.then,they tore on the bottom.in the past they would last at least 1year. very dissatisied."
1,Shoddy product.,"Garbage. The item shredded in two the first time I put it over my shoe and had to be tossed, unused. Based on this experience, I'd suggest avoiding the company."
2,Tingley rubber overshoe,"When my husband wore these to work, he was in dry conditions. He wore them for warmth. by the end of the day they had created condensation on the inside and his shoes were wet. so what good is it to wear themContractor"
2,Didn't work for my husband,"The overshoes were quite hard for my husband to put on and get off. He didn't like how they looked. There was not a problem with the quality of these overshoes, my husband simply didn't like them."
1,water shoes,My husband works in a meat Dept. He thought these would protect his feet from getting wet. Well these things riped in 2 days. Not worth it.
1,New Style vs. Old Style,"Based on the diagram of the Tingley Rubber 1300 High Top Work Rubber Stretch Overshoe, I thought I would be receiving the same overshoe that I have used for years. However, I was disappointed to find that Tingley has changed the model 1300 to be ""Bigger, wider and longer"" than the overshoe I was accustomed to. In fact...the new style was too big, too wide and too long to fit my boots properly. I've looked everywhere for the ""old"" style (exact same model number) but have not been able to find them. I wish Tingley would've left the ""old"" style alone and just created a new model, with a new model number, to accomodate the bigger, wider, longer boot/shoe. If you've had a pair of the ""old"" style and you liked the fit, you probably won't like the way the ""new"" style fits."
5,one size up,"Glad I read reviews first. One size higher fits my boots great slightly lose so easy to get on and off. I wear them over whatever shoes or boots I am wearing at the time, to go out in the garden. Good tread for leaving dirt and mud outside and easy to remove. Perfect for my needs. XL for my size 10."
5,OMG when is the next album OUT,WOW what can i say this cd is great!!!!! but Sam is better live i am always amazed when i listen to his cd.. And i am happy to say i was blessed to be a part of his life and music for a very short time :) keep these great cds coming Sam hope one will be out soon and hope to see a cover of a Nick Drake song plz :)
5,"Sam, Please tour Hawaii","Sam Pacetti should be a household name. His beautiful guitar work and touching lyrics deserve to be heard. If you haven't heard of him then take a chance and buy this cd. You'll listen and wonder who is playing with him, but see him live and you'll see that he needs no backup. Sam's music will change the way you look at life."
5,A landmark of how an accoustic guitar should sound.,"By far the finest example of Guitar Mastery... In my opinion, there is not a guitarist alive nor deceased that can compare to the talent displayed by Sam in Solitary Travel. If Taylor Guitars had any business sense at all, they would sponsor Sam Pacetti at any cost.This album is a must for anyone who claims to respect musical genious."
5,God given talent !,Sam Pacetti has a God given talent. That along with years of practice have enabled him to play a 6 string to it's fullest extent. He reminds me of Leo Kottke and the late Michael Hedges rolled into one. Sam is a excellent performer though very modest in person. He has the ability to amaze you and relax you all at the same time. Anything he plays comes highly recommended for a good reason.
5,Excellent- Best Album I have bought in 10 years,"I first saw Sam play about a year and a half ago in St. Augustine, Florida, and I will never see music in the same way again. Now I regularly watch him play on monday nights at the Milltop Tavern in St. Augustine. His music is even better live. We are truly blessed to have Sam with us and I am grateful to have had the chance to meet Sam and listen to his awesome talents on the guitar. You will not be disappointed with this CD no matter what type of music you listen to. I urge anyone who doesn't care for folk music to give this CD a chance to change their minds. This CD is the best!"
5,"Hey, Sam!","Well, I lived two houses down from Sam at school and got to know him. He plays even more beautifully live than on his CD. He is extremely talented and yet, so unassuming. He tells wonderfully funny stories and such touching stories through his music. It does not surprise me that he receives such high reviews. He truly is amazing. If you ever meet him, ask him to play the dueling banjos on his guitar. It is incredible!! sam, if you read this, your work is truly amazing! Nelson and I miss listening to you play. Come to Colorado!"
4,A master musician at work,"Deep, soulful, nuanced tabla instrumentals, three longer pieces recorded in 1991 by this remarkable North Indian percussionist. Strong performances throughout, and a welcome contrast to the faster-than-lightning playing that has become common in Indian concert music of recent years."
1,Cannot find mattress or linens that fit,"I am sending the port a crib back.. It is good looking but I cannot find the correct sized add ons. I have ordered the mattress and linens to match the interior size of the crib and nothing fits. I am also returning the mattress and sheets. I am ever so disappointed!!! The crib mailing box was discarded weeks ago so I will have to pay for the packaging and only hope Amazon will pay for the shipping. I have called the company Dream on Me to find mattress, pads, and sheets. Not only did they not have what I needed but the were very rude!!!"
2,Horrible Odor,"I would have given this item 4 or 5 stars for how easy it was to put up and take down and the pattern, but it had such a strong chemical odor that I had to return it. There is no way I would put my baby in there to sleep to inhale whatever chemicals were causing that odor - it smelled like strong adhesive. Very disappointed."
1,Defected from start,"I chose this play yard for the size because I hoped to use it for my growing 8-month-old. I found it to be very sturdy when I put it up out of the box, but when I went to then fold it, one side refused to budge. I never was able to get it down and returned it immediately. I considered (for a moment) keeping it even though it didn't collapse, but decided against that, as money is tight and products should work.My next--which was a simple pack-n-play by Graco--has proven to be good, simple to fold and move from room to room. The bottom doesn't seem as sturdy as the Dream on Me, though, and it is surely not as roomy...but, it isn't defected.Amazon was really great about the return of this, too, as I couldn't fold it into the original box due to the side that wouldn't budge, and they paid for the shipping of two boxes and gave me the full refund."
4,great value!,"The bottom of the inside of the playpen, that the baby sits, plays, and sleeps on is in connected sections, (to fold up for travel) heavy to lift, and slightly padded. I bought an extra pad to make it softer, (couldn't find the right size, as this company does not offer it here) and to conceal the wedges between the sections. The screen is soft, navy blue, and very attractive and larger than most play yards. It isn't light weight as advertised, and is difficult to place in its carrying case; you need two people to maneuver it into its case, making it awkward, thus only four stars. However, it is safe, attractive, well made, and the greatest value we've found on the internet."
3,why not make a cushy pad?,"nice and big for a 2 year old, but why cant they make a more cushy pad? sturdy, has lasted me more than a year, using it everyday."
5,Just what I needed,"I ordered this for a recent vacation. It is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to open, big enough that would last well onto 2-3 years of age. I originally wanted the blue color, but since amazon did not have it in stock I ordered the gray/red one. Happy with it! Great value for the price."
1,Worst pack and play ever!!,Mom's and Dad's do not buy this pack and play. I opened the package excited to set this up and right away I noticed how cheap it was. Then the worst part the middle brack was longer than the ones on either side of it... so the pack and play was not level and rocked. Sooooo unsafe. I called the company and they told me to call Amazon and return it. I'm so mad about this. The worst part was trying to put it back in the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,Excellent travel crib/playpen,"I just received this item a couple of days ago. I eagerly tried to set it up but couldn't get the two end pieces to lock up. I tried everything, checked instructions, etc., but no luck. I decided it was defective and got a return authorization for it. It turns out that it wasn't defective after all. The center piece has to be way up for all the sides to lock properly. The instructions say the center part should be up when locking up the sides but evidently it has to be just about all the way up for the sides to lock. This seems like an excellent item after all. I think a thin mattress or foam pad placed on top of the pad that comes with the item although several folds of a blanket might be as good. I think you'll be happy with thisif you buy it."
3,Majestic Twelve - a band from NC,"Majestic Twelve - a band from NCMajestic 12 - a southern California band (now just Majestic)I'm not really at liberty to review this, I bought it in hopes that it would be Majestic 12 -- an early incarnation of the band on shelflife records. It's not. It's kind of a hippish pop-jam band kinda thing. To me it sounds like OAR or the Old 97's, both of which are not my thing. Lots of jangly guitar and typical rock songwriting.I'd perfer not to rate this as it's not my bag, so I'll spare it from a few stars and likewise not glorify it as a gem either..."
2,Too expensive for near imperceptible results,"This is an extremely harsh product. It's very runny and pours quickly from the bottle. Breakouts didn't seem to improve that much but they did seem to heal a bit quicker. Skin was softer but if used daily, became irritated and red. Certainly not something I plan on spending money on again."
2,Looked better in Picture.,"I was diaappointed in the shoes. I thought they looked a little dressy, but instead cheap. Right now just using for knock around."
2,the color,"the britness wasnt the way it looks in the picture it was less , beside the shoes dirt my foot with color wich is comes from the shoes it self.the prise doesnt suet the itembut the time of deliverd was good.thanks"
3,"I dunno, I dunno","Very engaging story until the soppy romantic ending. Too many ""ughs, ers, and I dunnos"" for me. The writing became really irritating, maybe just a Brit language thing. I was reading an Anne Lamott book at the same time and the writing was so poor in comparison to Anne - this book became intolerable and I love chick lit. Ended up skimming that last six chapters.""I dunno - she took a slurp of beer"""
4,"Great writing, different story","I loved Ralph's Party and ThirtyNothing, and this one was more serious to me. I thought that Jewell's writing was fantastic, she really takes you in, it's just that maybe the main character was too meek and mild for my taste. And, the man she ends up with was so totally out of character/left field. I thought the story was endearing, and I never considered putting the book down. If you've never read Jewell before, I'd say read one of her other books first."
4,Nothing to fear...,"Lis Jewell has nothing to fear from the title of this fabulous read. I have not read any of her other books, but I just ordered them all. Her writing style, her ability to convey detail - but keep you laughing, interested -truly entertained. Watching Ana Wills blossom as a character, and discover Bee Bearhorn was one of the best reads I've had in a while. I will be passing this jewel onto everyone I know."
4,enlightening,"ONE HIT WONDER was an enjoyable book with a very important message - love your friends and family today for you know not when they are going to leave you! Ana grew up never really knowing her older sister, Bee, as anything other than a pop star. When Bee dies, Ana decides to uncover what could have possibly happened to her sister, the one who ""had it all"". It was sad to watch Ana learn so much about her sister through the eyes of her sister's friends. This book should make any reader recognize the importance of family and friendship and treasuring both right NOW! If after reading it you don't feel the need to mend some fences within your own life, then you just didn't get it. Great work by the author and I look forward to reading her other books."
2,One Hit Wonder,"BLAH! I did not really enjoy this book.... Definitely not what I had expected. Very dark & dreary. While the suspense of finding out what possessed Bee to do what she did was enough to keep me intrigued, the book just wasn't that great...."
1,Voyeurs,"I thought I would challenge my natural male fear of these 'Chick Lit' books, when unlucky enough to come across this one...... but it turns out that my taste, that is, for well written literature, can just not be over-come. This is bad, bad writing - bad characters, bad dialogue, bad plot - but since it is a book for lonely Auntie Mildreds past their sell-by date, none of this is important, the attraction of these books are psychological, not literary. By reading about prettier, thinner women finding the 'Flint' (please, no) of their dreams, the need for love is momentarily satisfied. What a cheap illusion. Silly girlies: even if you dont want to be taken seriously yourself, PLEASE stop insulting femalekind everywhere by buying stupid mindnumbing drivel like this."
5,The best of Lisa Jewell's first three books,"Of Lisa's books the first I picked up was Ralph's Party. She developed the characters in that book really well and I was quite engaged in the story. Before I even finished that book I ran out (well ran to my computer) and purchased Thirtynothing and One-Hit Wonder. I was a bit let down by Thirtynothing. It's a fun and fine read but missed the mark a bit for me.Where the other two fell slightly short, I felt One-Hit Wonder shined. The characters are very engaging (although I do agree with the reviewed who felt Flint's character could have been revealed more) and the story unfolds very well, with originality and mystery. I was captivated and never bored or right when I was guessing where it would lead. You just keep going around corners and seeing something you hadn't expected.A very enjoyable and memorable read!I see she has a new book now and will buy it immediately when it comes out in paperback in a few weeks."
5,Best Book of the Summer,"I have putting off reading this book all summer because I was not in the mood for it, what a mistake. One Hit Wonder was absolutely fantastic. It is a story of growth and understanding, finding yourself while uncovering the mystery that was your sister. This book was particularly engrossing, poignantly affecting a range of emotions (comedy, drama, romance); the moment I finished it I put it on my sister's desk for her to read. I have read all of Lisa Jewell's books and this story of Ana's search for her sister Bee and the discoveries that develop make this my easy favorite."
4,A jewel of a book,"A friend of mine leant me this book, and boy am I glad she did! This novel is well-written, the characters are descriptive and likeable and most importantly; the plot is an enthralling suspense story that keeps you interested as it unfolds. One Hit Wonder is based around a woman whose singer sister dies. After she travels to London to arrange her things, she begins to realize her sister had a secret life and she never really knew her at all. This book is an excellent journey you'll want to take."
5,This is the one to get!,"It was nice to read a review done by an actual musician, at least identified as a musician. I was fortunate enough to be living in Vienna and studying horn during the Bohm years. He had a very special relationship with the VPO and they played for him like for no one else.To call this a routine performance is to have no understanding of this piece. This is without a doubt the definitive performance of this music.Bohm knew what the VPO could do and he let them do it. The music shines and reflects the deep Bruckner soul. One must realize that part of this music is the resonance of the orchestral color itself apart from the notes. That is the essence of Bruckner! Don't miss this one."
5,Great playing and sound,"This is regarded by many experts as ""the"" recording of Bruckner's Fourth (as far as any can be so called) and it does not disappoint. The sound on this Decca disc is flawless, as has the others I've listened to in the ""Legends"" series. Sadly, Decca, like DG and EMI (esp. EMI) has a sad history of letting great recordings go out of print...don't miss this one if youre looking for a recording of this peice...it will be a long time before such a series is again seen."
2,Not quite!,"Karl Böhms' vision of Bruckners' fourth is a good attempt. But it is not quite good enough. His version lacks the titanic proportions wich are required. Böhm misses mystery and weight. By the time one gets to the third part, it's quit tempting to put on another record. Why this record is getting all the praise it's getting is a mystery to me. I admit that this recording does have its positive sides. Böhm has complete controle of the score and the Wiener Philharmoniker are playing their best music. But Bruckner requires a different approach. A marvelous recording of the ""Romantische"" is von Karajans '71 recording for EMI. Listen to that recording and you will ask yourself why you ever bothered with Böhm's."
4,"Your a monster,Hauted Mask","This moive is about a girl name CarlyBeth who finds this strange mask in a store.she takes it and when she puts it on,thats when it all starts geting fun.The mask stared to change Carlybeth into a monster.She plays tricks on her friend,her voice change,and she teach two kids a lession, but Carly Beth does not want to take it off,until she finds out that she and the mask had become one.Will she ever get the evil mask off her,or will she be stuck, scarying people forever,and never get her new, disgusting,red burning eyes,greensh skin,jaws,and new voice, forever? Find out in THE HAUTED MASK."
5,check under the bed,great movie for the tough 5yr old who isn't so tough after all. just make sure they don't watch just before going to bed as you will surely be sleeping in their room tonight.
3,And you thought this series wasn't going anywhere...,"The infamous R. L. Stine children's version of FEAR STREET (which is pretty childish itself) is transformed into a live action short thrown on FOX for Halloween. A lot better than one might expect from such a helling unearthed but if you're looking at the cover and questioning renting it, ponder what audience it was designed for first and foremost. Spawned a television show and a sequel short."
5,childhood favorite,this was one of my all time favorite goosebump movies. i wish i could have found it on dvd though.
5,Excellent,Sound quality is great and so is the performance! I wouldn't hesitate to purchase if you are on the fence.
3,Very pleased until the Subwoofer failed,Three days of use and I am sending the subwoofer in to be repaired. It was a great sounding system while it lasted. I did not abuse the subwoofer. I use it in a small room and at most played the volume at 35 on a scale of 1 - 50. I promise to come back and award more stars if the service is good. If the service is bad I can guarentee that you'll hear back from me.
2,Where's the Brad?,"This is a low cost, light duty nailer. The problem is, the plunger seldom returns to full height and the next brad just doesn't go. If you spray the plunger path with lots of WD-40, you might have a chance of getting your project finished. This was my first nailer and I didn't know better until I got my Porter Cable Finish Nailer. With the success that I had with it, I immediately went out and got the Porter Cable 1 1/4"" brad nailer and my problems disappeared. Fork out the extra ($$$), you won't be sorry!"
3,Cheap is as Cheap gets,"Paid little money for my Airy Brad Nailer (ATT-0232S). Got little service.As Scott Martin pointed out, the plunger will not recoil back to the starting point so it will not then pick up the next brad - thus, it ceases to work for other than a paper weight. Oil and fiddling will get you a nail or two and then more oil and fiddling. Seeking ideas to fix on the internet is a near total zero. No support page, no manuals, no FAQ no nada! Take the advice from others here and get a Porter Cable or some other brand that shows up on the internet with some help. Maybe if I spent the whole day looking I would find an AIRY manf. site."
3,Not as consistent as I would like,I was very disheartened when the first two disks out of the package failed to make it through a CD burning on Windows Media Player. I next tried to make a disk on Linux and it worked flawlessly... twice.Batting 50/50 is not what I hoped for. I have yet to try the disks with other Windows-based programs. I will update as I gather more info.
2,"Great concept, inadequate design","The car barely moved in the spring sun, and while it does better on a blazing day there still ought be some more margin of error, especially with the high price (Amazon's is good). The children I built this with were very disappointed. I will try adding more solar cells. Also the cardboard to me seemed likely to wear out, especially if the holes get enlarged. Overall a really neat concept but really the most important thing is that the car work first time out. Try again, Klutz."
2,Doesn't work as promised,"The book is interesting, but the car doesn't work as promised. (It barely moves! and we even made sure to try it midday in full sun)"
1,DID NOT WORK!,"I bought this for my daughter's science fair project which is due Nov. 14th! We put it together, following the directions and the trouble shooting when it wouldn't work...It still has NEVER worked!"
5,Great little solar car,I bought this for my third grade daughter's science project on solar energy. The car is easy to assemble and runs well. There are explanations and diagrams in the accompanying book. Well worth the money.
4,funny but also moving,"It is very funny, and at times broadly humourous. The most touching scene, beautifully done by the underrated Sophie Thompson, is the pivotal scene where she (as Miss Bates) is insulted by Emma. Miss Bates' brave face and faltering reply are heartbreaking and amazing to watch."
3,A Fun Film,"Emma, a young lady lacking neither fortune or conciquence, is blessed with all the good things in life. Her father, loving but odd man, has given her the best education, the best clothes, and a good name, she is free to move in good society with few limitations.In her free time, she was lucky enough to match up her governess with a family friend and is now determined to marry off all the other single young people in her neighborhood. Emma fails most brillently; she doesn't see how people attract and repell others around them--for reasons that they may or may not have any control over.Emma is also blind to her own faults and is not as wise or worldly as she thinks her self to be. This causes hurt feelings in more than one party, but everything is as it should be when the credits roll.This version of Emma is filled with beautiful people surrounded by beautiful things and carrying out their lives in a beautiful manner. It is a light, easy film that doesn't take alot of thought to enjoy."
2,DVD doesn't boot reliably,The DVD is in extremely good condition and plays very well. The difficulty is getting the thing going in the first place -- more often than one would expect.How do I know that it's this DVD? It's the only one that gives me this problem.Delightful movie.
3,flat,"this picture has little arc in its story. it's not clear where the story's heading, there's little dramatic tension, as a result it's rather dull. thankfully, the people and places are pretty to look at, and there is some humor here, but huh??? it's no pride and prejudice, or even persuasion. it certainly doesn't make me want to read the book."
1,Less Than 1 Star,"Emma (1996)The DVD was really poor quality. Even on maximum the volume was too quiet. The colour was terrible, and the picture was very dark. Acceptable quality could not be achieved by adjusting the picture. Looked like it had been recorded off a dodgy TV."
2,Quite a disappointment compared to the A&E version,"This version follows the novel more closely than the A&E version, but it lacks depth. The humor is almost campy at times. It seems they were so concerned with following the novel exactly that they forgot about quality. The scene catching butterflies is particularly bad. I guess we should leave Jane Austen novels to the Brits to get a realistic portrayal."
3,"Adequate, but misses Austen's subtlety","Emma goes riding. Emma shoots. Emma gets stuck in a bog and is rescued. If Emma had such an exciting life, she would not have needed to try to mold Harriet. Gwyneth Paltrow delivers an adequate performance, but demonstrates that she is entirely clueless about the humor in Austen's only decent novel."
5,"Funny, romantic, charming","Being a hopeless romantic and a fan of Jane Austen's works, I immediately rushed to see this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow was superb as the foolish Emma Woodhouse who knows all but her own heart. Toni Collette did an excellent job as her naive friend, Harriet; and characters like Mr. Woodhouse steal the show with their hilarious performances. A humorous satire on the life of the wealthy, Emma is a must-see movie for any romantic like myself. You will love the movie, but the book is even better, so buy both and enjoy!"
5,Wonderful!!!,My three-year old daugheter loves this film!!! The dialog is great and the costumes authentic. A very happy film. I can't wait to read the novel. A film that even a Christian can watch.
4,One of the better Austen movie adaptations,"I actually think this Austen adaptation is a delight. It adheres to the book well enough (it's only 2 hours after all). It's certainly faithful to the sensibility of the book. I think it's very well cast. There's genuine chemistry between Paltrow and Northam, which is important and something that's too often neglected in casting Austen films. Toni Colette and Alan Cummings are fun to watch. It's bright, refreshing, funny, and romantic. Enjoy!"
2,Not As Good As BBC's Emma,"I was disappointed in this version of Emma. As much as I enjoy watching Gwyneth Paltrow, she did not achieve the essential chemistry with her co-star (Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley). In BBC's version, the young Kate Beckinsale shines and her co-star Mark Strong is any woman's heart throb. I highly recommend BBC's Emma, but only weakly recommend this version."
2,Rather too cute,"Too much a vehicle for Paltrow, and too little a vehicle for Austen. The Beckinsale A&E version is much better, and I'm not sure that the BBC version was not the best - I cannot decide. But this one is superficial and unsatisfying. Too vague a Jane Fairfax, while Frank Churchill is sometimes too flashy and sometimes too dull and lumpish, while the relationship between these two is undeveloped. Miss Taylor is too young and foolish, and Mr. Knightley looks still wet behind the ears - no match for his Emma. Emma is too pretty and Harriet not pretty enough, the hypochondriac father, so richly and amusingly portrayed in both the other versions, is just thrown away here, while the Harriet Smith character is rather wooden and the Harriet-Emma relationship lacks most of the humor Austen wickedly portrayed in it - which the other two versions bring out very well. I will say, I do like the portrayal here of one of Austen's prize jerks - the ineffable Mrs. Elton."
5,One of my favorites!,"I absolutely adore Emma, it is witty, funny, and adorable. The costumes are excellent (I in fact made a replica of Emma's pink archery gown) and the set is absolutely amazing. Anyone will feel right at home in Highbury with Emma and her friends."
1,a dissapointment,"This is a sad, sad version of a beloved story.Even Gwyneth Paltrow's excellent proformance can not save this film. The screenplay was horrible, Northam as Knighley laughable and the hair very incorrect. It does not have that timeless quality a Jane Austen classic deserves. In 10 years it will be dated as a 1990's studio formula film.While it does have some funny and entertaining parts (also the costumes ARE good) it simply doesn't do justice to the book or the charaters. Too long on farce and too short on charm.If you want to see a good, believeable version watch the A&E Emma (1996 with Kate Beckinsale). Don't bother with this one."
2,"a romantic sort of movie, but ...","The problem in that movie is that nothing happens! It is not a bad movie, but I found the story too long. At least the movie shows how to improve one's own life by helping others improve theirs!"
1,Could there be a bigger waste of time?,"The definition of fad.By the time Emma Thompson was attempting her Austen-esque witticisms as she received her screenplay adaptation Academy Award for Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen was already finished as a viable movie source. Almost as quickly as she became hot, she was not. I just don't think many had realized it yet.Emma is a weak premise, at best, and this interpretation is outright intolerable. To say it pales in comparison to Clueless may be brash, considering the teen-fodder compost that was the Amy Heckerling version.Sometimes classic literature should remain just that, literature.Could there be a bigger waste of time with Gwyneth Paltrow present? Unfortunately yes---it's called Great Expectations (1998)."
2,"hey, did any of you dudes catch that they ripped off the plot from clueless?","this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade, with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic. fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of WHY i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind, but it was a mess."
5,A Sweet lovestory,I loved this movie!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. My all time favorite movie is Sabrina with Harrison Ford and Emma is now right along side. This is a movie that just makes you smile all the way through and leaves you with a tingle when it is over. It's not a movie for anyone other than those who like the light romantic movies of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts. I fell in love with Jeremy Northam. He is absolutely gorgeous! Buy this movie--you will watch it over and over and love it more each time!
5,A great version of Emma,"I highly recommend this version of Emma it's great. GwynethPaltrow is ecellent in is as Emma. It is colorful, the costumes are absolutley beautiful, and so is the scenery. it's a must see for all Jane Austen fans or fans of the regency era in general."
2,queen of the gossip and ill match-making witch,"a quite boring movie with shallow heroine character, a snobbish, phony, self-important, self-righteous, self-centered female egoist. the novel is also as boring as the movie itself. like gossip? watch the daytime soap operas, hard copy, access to hollywood...."
2,b-o-o-o-ring,"this movie is good, if you like this kind of movie. the british accents are hard to understand, the plot is hard to follow, and the entire movie is boring, unless you like that kind of movie"
2,Wasn't impressed,I enjoyed the book but didn't enjoy the movie. The lead actors did a good job but I didn't like the other actors. Wasn't Harriet supposed to be beautiful? I felt the story was rushed and as a Jane Austen fan I didn't like this adaptation.
4,A pleasure film,"This was a very enjoyable film, thanks motly to Gwyneth Paltrow, who gave a clear portrayal of the essence of the book, of the same name, written by the much celebrated author, Jane Austen. I would offer a moderate recommendation to those who particularly enjoy the work of this author, & who enjoy the quality of performance offered by G. Paltrow. I did think that casting Toni Collette as Harriet Smith was a very poor choice, but I am unable to suggest who might be qualified for that part."
2,Gwneth is as exciting as warm milk,"I just don't like Gwyneth paltrow. She bothers me. Perhaps that's why I did not enjoy this version of Emma as much as ""Jane Austen's Emma"" with the stunning Kate Beckinsale in the title role. Kate has a spirit that Emma possesses and Gwyneth lacks.Both are faithful adaptations of the book, but I just found the other one had more true spirit.Also, while Mark Stong, who was Mr. Knightley in the Beckinsale version, is not as classically handsome as the very cute Jeremy Northern (or Northam? I haven't got my copy with me to check) I found him to be much sexier. He also seems to exude manliness in an almost palpable way, giving me all kinds of interesting thoughts. Northam, again, is very handsome, but too droll for the forthright Knightley.I have compared the two twice now, and found that this version is just blah compared to the Beckinsale/Strong one."
1,Emma,"I am not a tech wiz at all and don't require exquisite quality dvds to enjoy a movie so you can imagine my surprize when I eagerly poped in my newly purchased dvd and find that the quality was HORRIBLE. Even I noticed. The skin color is oringy and the whole picture is fuzzy, not sharp. Mine is a widescreen version (which I lately discovered I don't like because it takes away so much from the size of the picture- but that is just a personal opinion, I wasn't rating that) and in addition to the bad quality it was even harder to see (I don't have any eyesight problems).I have seen Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow before and I am o.k. with it but I do think the British version is better.Having said all that, now I regret not paying a little more money and just purchase that one.My copy is unenjoyable and when I attempt to watch it, I get somewhat fustrated by it. So I usually chose other DVD's over this."
3,Tales of a busybody.,"Emma is Jane Austin's most human creation. She is lovely, elegant and coddled. PLUS, she is a meddlesome, sharp-tongued busybody who tries to control everyone around her, regardless of their own preferences. When finally called to task by her best friend, Mr. Knightly, a neighbor who routinely visits her father, she is forced to confront her worst attributes, admit to them and start to mend her fences. Of course, anyone who has seen ""Clueless"" knows that Mr. Knightly is also Mr. Right."
1,BORING!,"This movie is very boring if you are a teen. I fell asleep in the middle of it. The dialog was just completely boring. I don't really want to offend anyone but if you do not like olden things, than this is definitly not for you!"
2,SLOW....,It had potential but unfortunately i did not get around to seeing it all because i was so bored by it after only 30 min that i actually turned it off... The plot is cute and ive heard the book it was based on was pretty good but all i can say is that this video definetley was NOT.
2,Could have been better,"This version of Emma was simply a vehicle to spotlight Paltrow. The scenery was spectacular, the costumes were beautiful. It is a very ""pretty"" movie and in that way enjoyable to watch. (with the sound turned down) Paltrow's acting was just that , acting. She was totally unbielevable as was ""Harriet"". The actress who played Harriet was just awful. Paltrow came off as silly, and unconvincing as Emma. The A&E version was much more like the book and the acting top notch. When watching Kate Beckinsale as Emma, you felt she really understood the character she was portraying. She was totally natural and at ease with the dialog of that period. This version of Emma can't begin to compare with A&E'S."
3,"Intelligent, but unengaging","This is a small story, in that nothing really ""happens"" in it. It's a character study, set in a small circle of upper-class denizens of a village in Elizabethan England. The most dramatic moment is when Paltrow's character lets an insult slip out of her mouth - an act most unbecoming a lady.From a technical point of view, this movie is nicely crafted. The acting is top-notch, and the story is tight. The look and feel of the period shows an attention to detail that is fun to watch.The only problem is that it was unable to make me care much about any of the characters, or what happened to them. Even when the characters were watching their lives crumbling, I still felt like a member of the audience, watching the actors moving around on the screen. Nothing that happened was able to draw me into the movie."
3,Picture Clarity Lacking,"What a shame that the DVD format is so abused by this release. I played my old VHS version after I viewed the DVD version and the color blance and saturation was far superior on the VHS version. The DVD version's images are wanting in sharpness and detail, exhibiting a soft focus throughout; however, the trailers found within the special features on the DVD displayed the sharp focus and rich colors you would expect from a quality DVD. This DVD version should be found in the $[money] budget video shelf."
3,Unexpectedly good,"I never would have watched a Jane Austen starring Gywneth Paltrow but I sat down to watch this because my mom had rented it. It was surprisingly well done. It is very true to the book and though not comparable to a BBC production in ""feeling"" like a Jane Austen and not a Hollywood production it was unexpectedly enjoyable. Any Jane Austen fan should watch this one, at least once."
4,Capturing the spirit of _Emma_...,"This adaptation of Jane Austen's classic lives up to the witty, lighthearted tone of the novel. Gwyneth Paltrow makes an excellent Emma - active, sweet, and slightly scattered - ""faultless in spite of her faults."" Sophie Thompson is a wonderfully effusive Miss Bates, and the oft-maligned Jeremy Northam is a believeable - and appropriately youthful-looking - Mr. Knightley. Though Austen fans will lament the exclusion of the ""alphabets"" scene, the screenplay manages to bring together most of the key plot elements into a cohesive, entertaining, and visually beautiful whole. The production design is exquisite, and Ruth Myers' costuming is a stunning (if not entirely period) example of Regency style. Rachel Portman's sweeping musical score adds magic to this beauty."
4,Funny,"This is a funny story which is very roughly based on ""Emma"" by Jane Austen. If you think about it seriously, the storyline is practically exactly the same as ""Cluless!"" It's worth your while watching, and I can garantee that this is a good show for popcorns."
2,Any movie with Ewan MacGregor singing can't be all bad...,"Perhaps I would have liked this adaptation if I hadn't seen the BBC's version first. Or if I hadn't read the book. However I regret to report that Miramax's ""Emma"" was painful to watch. I felt like they were trying too hard. Perhaps the screenwriters were desperatley hoping to rake in the ""Clueless"" audience. As an avid admirer of all things Austen I was throughly disappointed. The story was so chopped up, not simply abridged, but chopped, that I didn't feel the closeness of the relationships that I got from the other version and the book. It was sadly 2 dimensional and forced. But, any movie with Ewan MacGragor singing can't be all bad."
5,Take me away,"This is my ultimate favorite movie-story.It's just beautiful. Starting with the characters, they are such likable people,people one might wish to know in real life.The cinamatography is wonderful! Each scene is a piece of artwork in motion. The dance scenes are enchanting .I've probably watched this film 20+ times. Because it impresses the importance of honest friendship."
5,This movie is well done--and I am not even a Gwyneth fan!!,"While I am generally not a fan of Paltrow (and I usually leave her films feeling that she is just too over-rated as an actress) I have to admit to finding her charming in this light-hearted rendition of Emma. Emma, not my favorite Austen story, contains perhaps Austen's silliest characters, but her humor is well served here, and I recommend this version highly."
2,Just Because It's Austen......,"....doesn't mean this is a good film. In fact it is pretty dire. Paltrow certainly gets into the role as meddling young Emma Woodhouse who, despite her good intentions, thinks far too much of herself and messes things up good and proper when trying to marry her friends off to eachother.But this is so evidently awkwardly made that it is embarassing and it sufficates the briming potential energy that everyone seems to have in this film.And Ewan McGregor as the supposed rake who behaves most inappropriately is incredibly wooden.The only redeeming feature this film has is Alan Cumming who is terrific as the pompous Mr. Elton - it is just a shame he is let down by everything else."
3,Emma,"My feelin is that this particular video is not the best quality, although I find the story charming and the cast wonderful"
2,Boring,"I've never been a fan of 19th century love stories, but even among that category Emma ranks pretty low. I watched this movie because my wife wanted to. The mindless conversation goes on and on, and soon you just forget what they're talking about. Even Gwyneth Paltrow can't save the movie. My wife wasn't a big fan of it either."
4,Nice.,"Very sweet movie, you do have to pay attention. So as to know what is going on... The ending is very good. Gives me a nice warm feeling!"
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","To be honest (and this is addressed directly to those who complained about the movie), the first time I rented ""Emma"" I couldn't get through it and fast-forwarded directly to the last scene. I decided to give it another chance, however, and have since watched it six times. It is truly wonderful! The movie's atmosphere and language is very true to that of Jane Austen (I just finished ""Northanger Abbey"" and can verify this). The scenes themselves are very beautiful to look at--the scene in which Emma hides the mail from her father looks just like a painting. The acting is wonderful, especially from Jeremy Northam and (yes) Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr. Northam was fascinating in a close-up (watch the way he looks out of the corner of his eyes at Emma) and Ms. Paltrow was beautiful and projected the right combination of self-absorption and good will. In short, I highly recommend this film to anyone in the world. If you don't like it at first, be sure to give it another chance."
3,Good but not good enough for and Austen fan.,"Emma is one of my least favorites of Miss Austen's work and in fact I never could finish it.However, that being said the story does have some merit to it and the 2 most recent films have done there best to adapt it to the screen.The 1997 Kate Bekinsale version a far superior to this version.Not because this film is not well acted or badly cast, because it is not. I like the entire cast of this film, although Ewan looks just damn silly with thet hair piece/wig whatever, yuck!However as far as the story the Bekinsale version is much more accurate historicaly and to the novel. The characters are not hollywooded up nor the script dumbed down as the Paltrow version is.Please if you do like period movies and you liked Emma Thompson'sSense and Sensibility and the Colin Firth's Pride and Prejudice get the Bekinsale Emma, you will prefer it to this version by a mile!"
1,Very poor quality,I ordered three DVDs of different movies and this one was very poor quality compared to the others I received. There is no excuse for this. It was shrunk down and looked like it had been taped off a poor quality TV program. I've rented this movie from Blockbuster and it looked fine. What happened?! Hope I don't get anymore that look like this.
2,The Worst version of Emma,I have both versions of Emma Kate Beckensale and Gwyneth Paltrow versions and I must say that Ms Paltrow completely ruined the story for me. Emma is supposed to be spoilt and used to her own way but not spiteful Ms Paltrow made her out to be prissy and stupid. Mr Knightly I liked in many ways but found that Mr Churchill was a prat when he should have been more of a man I would have not given him the time of day. Miss Smith was a simpering simpleton not a bit like the character in the book. I am sorry but I cannot recommend this dvd to anyone
4,Emma as Cupid,"This is a cute version of Emma and I really enjoyed it. The archery scene was great for a good chuckle when Mr Knightly tells her "" Try not to kill my dogs"". Jeremy Northam had a completely different style in his portrayal of Mr. Knightly from Mark Strong's Mr Knightly tho I liked his as well. Yes, I have both Emmas but this one had more to offer in the cast. Ewan McGregor has a wonderful singing voice and I was overjoyed to hear him sing in the duet with Emma. This Emma had more up to date comedy that I could relate to. I would reccomend getting this version for your library."
3,It's a cute movie...BUT,"I haven't seen other versions of this Austen book, so I can't compare...but I found Paltrow's EMMA an enjoyable way to lose two hours on a Sunday afternoon. The scenery was nice, the acting adequate, and the costuming great."
1,Lack of understanding makes movie dreadful.,"From a die-hard Jane Austen fan, I can honestly say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was clear watching this film that none of the characters, directors, producers, or anyone involved in the making of this film actually understood the book. Emma is portrayed only as a pretty English woman who has social class and knows it. But the character of Emma is so much more complex. Now, granted, Emma is probably the hardest Jane Austen book to film, because Emma IS so complex, and it's hard to get on-screen, but Paltrow and McGrath did an extremely poor job. When I watched this movie, I had no desire to ever look at the book again.If you want to see a fantastic adaptation of Emma, watch the 2009 BBC adaptation. Not only is it much better than the Paltrow/McGrath, it is perfect. You will watch the adaptation, and want to start reading the book that night."
3,"Misguided, but somehow pleasing.","There's no reason this should work as well as it does. This is a very broad adaptation and the performances in general are unsubtle and broad as well. Ms. Paltrow's accent is heinous, and Ms. Collette's work is frankly annoying (though that is in part as written.) As the movie moves from set piece to set piece, lingering endlessly on the beautiful design, one can't help but think that if Ms. Austen's Emma had actually had so much to do, she'd have been little bored enough to spend so much time meddling in her friends' affairs. But in the end, the good will evinced by all involved somehow makes a film that charms very much in spite of several and severe flaws. The BBC version of Emma is much superior in adherence to the Austen story, and Clueless certainly has the edge for humor, but this is a fair adaptation that ultimately is more success than failure."
1,Emma is missing in Emma,"Dreadful adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. The book deserves far, far better -- perhaps a mini-series like the wonderful versions of P&P, or a more talented screenwriter such as Thompson's S&S. The Paltrow Emma is paltry, leaving out critical scenes, and then inserting strange ones (what is that harvest scene doing at the end, anyway)."
4,It's all about Austen.,I love all Jane Austen stories! although now I can't watch Emma without picturing Alicia Silverstone... For anyone that loves period pieces this is a deffinate reccomendation.
4,"Good, clean fun!","Once again, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't hold anything back in this lovely and refreshing version of Emma. Captivating view, acting, and script makes this a joy to watch. You'll cringe when she insults, be sad when she is, and laugh at everyone's antics. All aspects of this glorious film are well done, and in conclusion, this movie leaves almost nothing more to be desired in a film. Good, clean fun!"
4,Lighter and more fun than the BBC version,"I decided to rent both this Emma and the BBC version before purchasing - this version is by far the more fun and light-hearted. (The BBC one was almost depressing!)Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly joins Colin Firth and Ciaran Hinds as the perfect Austin heroes, strong, subtle, sweet. Paltrow portrays a nice sweet, good-intentioned style for Emma, although she does seem to have only two expressions (""pouting"" and ""deleriously happy"". Okay, maybe ""puzzled"" as well.)This is more of a romp than most of the Austen films of the time, but that's what I find appealing about it."
3,An OK Adaptation,I much prefer the A&E/BBC version of this movie. You may like this version if you are a Paltrow or Northam fan.
5,"Get off Gwenyth, she was excellent!","Why does everyone seem to be hounding on Miss Paltrow's talents? She is a very beautiful actress and proved to us there's more to just beauty in her performance. Paltrow executed her lines with stunning realism taking on the meddling, quirky traits of Emma Woodhouse. Jane Austen would be ecstatic at the flawless portrayal of her most controversial heroine. And the other actors were superb too. Mr. Knightly was just that: a knight in shining armor. And Mr. Elton was the scoundrel you love to hate. And the rest of the cast, oh, I could write volumes on their performances as well. So, if you haven't at least seen this movie, rent it!"
2,Shallow,"This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances. Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly). I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses. People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it. For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale."
4,Wonderful movie!,"This movie ranks among my all-time favorite movies. It's a wonderful adaption of the Jane Austen's novel. Gwyneth Paltrow is delightful as the title character, not to mention the great acting by Jeremy Northam and Toni Collete. I fell completely in love with Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightley after watching the movie. :)Having watched both the Paltrow version and the A&E version of the novel, I have to say that i enjoyed this version a lot more. The Paltrow version captures the light-hearted atmosphere and humor of the novel far better than the A&E version. Also, I liked Northam's more sympathetic Mr. Knightley in comparison to Mark Strong's stern approach to his character.My only bone to pick with the Paltrow version is how the director treated the Jane Fairfax/Frankchurchill subplot. It seemed like there wasn't enough time to include a more drawn-out story. The A&E version did a much better job with it."
4,Fun not Frocks,Finally a period piece that doesn't focus on what the characters are wearing or how perfect the dialogue is so much as whether the story is enjoyable to watch. Emma is fun to watch. It's predictable and has the standard rouster of characters for this type of movie but that doesn't matter. If you want to see an unpretentious period piece with a superb cast and a happy ending all around then Emma is a great movie.
5,Love it!,"Emma is one of my favorite English period piece films! Gwyneth Paltrow is sublime as the only American in a cast of Brits. I watch this movie over and over again - with romance, intrigue, humor and great filmmaking, Emma is definitely a 5 star."
5,Great,"This movie is a great love story, an example of love right before your eyes. l definetly recommend this movie!"
1,Who told her she could act?,"Does Paltrow think she is British? Can we get force her into early retirement? This woman cannot act for anything, and she is awful in this movie. The rest of the cast are good, but Paltrow ruined this movie for me."
3,"Ehh, it was okay.","Product was in good shape and arrived on time. Gwyneth Paltrow has about as good of an English accent in this movie as Kevin Spacey has of a southern accent in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Either way, it's one of the Jane Austen novels set to movie so as far as the plot goes, it was a good."
5,love all of the Austen movies! Emma is one of my favorites though!,If you like light hearted movies without violence or sex then Emma is for you.
5,Weedeater line,"This line is WEEDEATER ready to get rid of all of the weeds that I atack! I have not had the need to use as yet, but I'm sure will work fine."
4,Line,It is what I need for my hobby. The rolls are not big enough. Otherwise its okay.I will order more.
4,Great deal!,"The package shipped the day after we ordered it and arrived 2 days later. The sting is strong and good quality for a great price! Must be used with a refillable weed eater, which we have, and is way cheaper than buying the cartridges of string."
5,The right stuff.,This line was suggested when I ordered the weed eater as you know you get a better deal buying both together and no hassle trying to find the right size line. All the right stuff in one click.
4,All trimmers need good lines,"All trimmers are like writers, they need good lines. The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars!"
5,Good deal!,Got this for use in my Black & Decker cordless trimmer and it works great! It was also a better deal than at my local home improvement store.
5,Perfect fit for Black and Decker Trimmer,"I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer. I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them, but they cost a small fortune compared to using this. I have re-strung two carts. and have had great success with them after using this product. The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original. Definitely a great way to save money if you don't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming, weedwacking, and edging - I still have tons of string left! What a great investment! My property is not very large, about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey. (around 3500 sq feet of lawn space)."
5,Fantastic Service and Product!!,Thankyou so much for a fantastic product and excellent service. You have made my first time buying from this site an exceptional experience. I will definitely be buying from you again!! Definitely a recommended seller.
2,Hmmmm....,"Read this book in a couple of evenings. A friend gave it to me for a laugh. Unfortunately there is no humour in it. While B.O is correct about a few things in this book,like dont trust the media, it is mostly an angry middle aged whiteman rant. If you watch fox news dont you already get that? If you want a insightful and humourous book get Al Frankens Book......"
4,Well done,"If you are a fan of O'Reilly you will enjoy his book. I have watched ""The Factor"" for a few years now and much of his book is analysis of things seen in his program. I consider myself a middle of the road citizen when it comes to politics. I've read Michael Moore, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and Hillary Clinton's books. The reason I do this is because politically, you have the left, the right, and somewhere between them is the truth. In my opinion, Bill is the best at what he does, news analysis. If your extremely conservative you won't like this book. If your extremely liberal you will not like this book. If your like most americans (middle of the road) you will enjoy this read. I highly recommend it."
2,Whiny and little or no solution,"I am a fan of O'Reilly, although not a major one. I like his stuff and he generally does a superb job at finding the stuff that the mainstream liberal media elite shun. This book however was something that I had high hopes for and was disappointed. It came across as whiny and detailed WAY to many problems with little or no solutions. O'Reilly deals with all aspcts of American life and details how certain groups are NOT looking out for you and only for themselves. Basically, I know this stuff already but I got depressed the further I read into the book. You are better off reading this at your local library than buying it for $18 or whatever. If you want people to look out for you, VOTE and stay active. Things will change rapidly when you do."
1,I can't give Zero stars,"Wow, after reading Bills other books I was really looking forward to reading this one. I wanted political talk and got a puff piece that looks like it was written to counteract the Al Franken book, just thrown together to make Bill look like humanities gift to news. As we all know from his show, Bill seems to think he is being attacked at all times. This book seems to make an attempt to bring Bill back into the human race. It really is sad. When you ask ""who is looking out for you"" think of me, and save your $18.00. You will thank me later."
1,Andrea Makris Hated it.,"Who's looking out for Bill? His lawyers and 'left wing 'smear sites' that accurately quote him that's who. Check out thesmokingun.com for the law suit he SETTLED after he SMEARED her. Shut Up! Bill Shut Up! This book is full of more Billisms ""The left hates this country, any one who voted for the Democrats HATES this country""...""hey I'm gonna smoke em out! I'm the President I'm gonna ship em all off to Guantanimo and gag em with wet Korans"" Nice stuff Bill you so clever."
1,That's my girl!,"Hey folks, Dubya here. Ok, first off: I didn't read the book (can't read). I'm not writing this review either (can't write); I'm dictating this to someone else.Basically, I ream B.O. nightly. Hard. And each night, his reply is, ""more, daddy, more, more, more."" I especially like when he wears his Viking helmet and I grab the horns and he does his best Ned Beatty impression.So why only one star? Because that beyotch gave me the clap! (It turns out he's been messing around with Ann Coulter.) You see, ol Bill has a problem: he wants to jump into bed with every Republican he meets. And he's usually on the receiving end (even with Ann- don't ask).The only reason he's still my girl is because Rush is history. It got difficult being with a guy who's always passed out stoned in a pool of his own vomit. Yes, I'm starting to think Bill is pathetic, but of course that won't stop me from using him."
1,Whoa....,"I started to read this book, but then I thought I'd check Amazon and I saw where it was selling for 29 cents. That convinced me that here was another boob writing about things he didn't know anything about, so I didn't finish reading it. Now I see that O'Reilly's on some sort of tear up in Vermont about some Judge or something.....boy he can't have much to do....but then I guess he has to feed his ego...."
1,Pornographer turned know it all,"Bill O'Really used to be a pornographer...check out his novel THOSE WHO TRESPASS which contains graphic porno scenes.Now he's a know it all right winger who spews hatred, even referring to Mexicans on his show as ""wetbacks""Anybody who listens to this guy is seriously uneducated."
1,Why do I want to be like Bill?,"I have to admit, I enjoy watching his show, but why does that qualify him to tell me how to parent or choose friends? It is just like Andy Rooney telling me not to wave my American flag. He needs to stick to cereal box segments and Bill O'Reilly needs to stick to interviewing politicians. I am tired of all public figures thinking they are ""experts"" on all subjects. When Bill O'Reilly spent a week downing the high school ""parents"" that had a ""private"" party for their children's senior formal. I decided he was in the ""know it all, but really know nothing"" zone.Talk about what you know, Bill. Stop trying to look ""politically"" correct by throwing in social issues. I am interested in your political views, but not your parenting or social views."
