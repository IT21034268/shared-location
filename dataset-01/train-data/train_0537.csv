3,Really pricey,"This is nothing more than a poster. Thin paper. Nothing special. And the size is very unusual so framing it was an expense. In the end, the whole thing, including the frame, cost me close to fifty bucks. It looks terrific in the kids' room but I repeat, it is just a poster."
1,Run now!,"I've had this machine for 3-years. Unless you just want to rip 2x4's for framing, run away from this purchase. The motor is good, but that's only positive bit of news about this saw.The miter slots are a joke. The included gauge has about 3/16"" of slop in them, and no other gauges on the market fit it either. The throat plate stinks too. Forget making a zero-clearance insert, because the table top is so poorly designed that you can only use a steel throat plate. Plan on building sleds for any cross-cutting you want to do.Don't even get me started on the fence which I bent while bolting a sacrificial fence on it the very first day."
2,Spend a little more and get a good saw.,"I should have spent another 100 bucks and bought a better quality saw. No such thing as a bargin! The Delta 10"" table saw is a poorly made product produced in Tiawan. Out of the box the blade needed adjustment. The adjustment mechanism is hard to reach. I had to max out the adjustment to square the blade. The table top does not have grooves or lines to align the fence. The fence moves a 1/16"" when I tighten it. I have to measure from blade to fence for every cut. The motor vibrates when cutting any board thicker then 1 1/2"" resulting in an uneven cut. Even if you're a beginner looking for an entry level saw...don't buy this saw. You'll be frustrated. A good carpenter doesn't blame his tools...but with this poorly designed and made saw I'll make an exception. I regret buying this saw."
2,Save Up for a Contractor Saw!,"I initially gave this saw 5 stars. Not sure what I was smoking that day. After using this saw for about a month, I got so sick of the small table and terrible fence that I went out and purchased a contractor saw. It was the best decision that I made. I've been using it for over 6 months and love the size of the table. I lost about [price] selling this one used. I guess this one would be ok for the very occasional woodworker, but if you get addicted to wwing like me, then you will wish you had a bigger saw very quickly. Just remember the tablesaw is the heart of any workshop, don't waste your money on this circular saw, oh I mean table saw :)"
5,Simply Beautiful!,"I've been a fan of Anne Murray since high school,and at 44 I'm even more so!This CD is the essence that is Ms.Murray! She puts her soul into these already classic and lovely songs.The inside cover has a list of the songs and the artists who previously recorded them,which were an inspiration to Ms.Murray.Dare I say it? She out does most,if not all of the ""original"" artists;at the very least,she honors them highly with her renditions!And these were some heavy weights;Patti Page,Peggy Lee,Perry Como,Rosemary Clooney,Eddy Arnold,Doris Day!I love the old standards in this recording;(especially ""Secret Love"",""When I Fall In Love"",and""You Belong To Me"") I love even more hearing them sung in Ms.Murray's beautiful,one of a kind alto!My copy is probably going to wear out soon,as I play it constantly,getting lost in it!:)I've heard most of these songs through out my life,although I'm too young to remember when most of them were original hits, so bless Ms. Murray for recording them!"
4,One of her best!,"With the advent of new country, dependable artists like Anne Murray were pushed aside. Not to rest on her laurels, Murray has branched out in the 1990s. CROONIN' is a fine example. Singing the songs that she grew up, Anne Murray focuses on what she does best-easy listening. The music is clean, straight and simple. Songs such as ""Make Love to Me"" and ""Secret Love"" are the stand-outs. ""Wayward Wind"" has a nice flute solo that is really pretty. It would be a real treat if Anne Murray revisits the songs of the gentle 50s and record a sequel."
5,only they wear out,"The only problem I have with these is they don't last forever!!! Years but not forever.I have bought sooo many of these batteries, to keep the 2 drills, one flashlight, weed eater and hedge trimmer running. The way the tools last, I hope to keep buying batteries for another 20 years"
3,Valentine gift,"This was much nicer than I thought it would be. Very pretty, and classy. Given and recieved with great appreciation. She is thrilled, and doesn't know the (low) price."
2,wish I had known,This was one of my favorite movies but wish I had known before I purchased it that it is not viewable in my region.Ut was my mistake and a costly one.
1,ripoff,Was all set to watch this film and realized that playback was prohibited by area limitations. Mainly that it will not play in the USA. Might have been nice to include this information. Or was I expected to travel to another country to play it. Wish I had kept the address.
1,Bad move,"I did not realise this dvd is not made for USA viewing, what a waste of my money! Who knew what region 2 meant!!"
1,Don't Think So,"This CD is okay but i think that its not all that great. The ""Kumbia Kings"" are better then K1.The K1 are copying the Kumbia Kings style and they need to make a stlye of their own.NO HARD FEELINGS"
5,DAMN!!!,"WHAT CAN I SAY?? The time has come for the world to know the boyz known as K-1!! The whole album is off da hook, ya'll got to make sure to pick this album up for yourself and for everyone you know! I can't say that I have a favorite song because I dont, I love all the songs, especially 'Amor, Familia y Respect with Fat Joe!!!! Don't forget to pick it up!!*K-1 Forever!*"
4,These are the Kumbia Kings,"They sound so much like the old style Kumbia Kings because there are six former members of Kumbia Kings in K1. Didn't the ""birdcalls"" make it pretty obvious? Duh! They are not copycats, because they are imitating themselves! If you like Kumbia Kings you will like this. Bircalls and all!"
5,K1 #1,"I think K1 one is better than Kumbia kingz!! Because Kumbia Kingz are nothing but old stuff. K1 has a new style and have kept the same. Also Kumbia Kingz are not the same without slim,dj kane, and the rest of them. Without them kumbia kingz would not have any Lubbstyle!!!!"
4,My first video and still a favourite,This is the first Playboy video I saw and it was a revelation. The girls move! And from the opening scene (getting covered in paint) at least up to Brittany (Sweet Goodness Aplenty!) it is a worthy initiation into the pleasures of motion pictures.
5,Great Set of Concertos,"This is a marvelous set of mozart's wind concertos. De Peyer is an incredible musician who executes the clarinet concerto with sheer brilliance. Elegant and refined, this is the only recording of this concerto you'll ever need. The flute and bassoon concertos are remarkable as well. John Mack is a wonderful player who shapes the most beautiful phrases in the oboe concerto, and puts a touch of elegance on every note he plays. Tuckwell is a notoriously excellent musician, and his interpretation of the horn concertos are certainly 1st-rate, with an accompaniment to match. These CD's are certainly an asset to any Mozart-lover."
4,Jesus died for somebody's remixes but not mine...,"This album features Heroin from the Cyberpunk album plus four remixes. A must have for all Billy Idol fans. Track list is as follows:1. V.R. Heroin2. Original Mix3. Needle Park Mix4. Overlords Mix5. Nosebleed MixIronic that after Cyberpunk was released, Billy had his overdose on Heroin (or was it Cocaine?) and put his career on hold until the recent release of Devil's Playground."
5,Complete Magic,"Eclectic is a word that fits most Canadian bands these days. We Are Wolves, are loud, they change speeds and sound great.Sometimes it sounds like the new rave of the Klaxons, the bluesrock of Jon Spencer and the White Stripes, but with distorted vocals that sometimes even sound like Chemical Brothers samples or Cylons from the old Battlestar Galactica series.It's loud, hard to define and maybe not the easiest music but if you get it you're really in for a ride."
3,Ok quality,"I feel the size was correct, unlike other reviews. My daughter has followed sizes exactly based on her age since she was born and these fit fine. I was hoping for a little more from the quality though. I haven't washed them yet so hopefully they won't get worse. They're just a normal t-shirt, like the one a man would wear under a dress shirt. I was hoping for something a little thicker that feels more like a stand alone shirt."
2,Sizing,"Be careful, this runs REALLY small. I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old. Otherwise, it seems of nice quality."
4,Boots,Shoes arrived quickly. Very happy with the color and look. Find the shoes a bit larger from the size 9 I usually wear with comfort. However I wear inserts and this works. They are warm so probably not suitable for summer. Hoping they will be fully broken in soon.
4,Good value online,"A good quality boot offered about ten dollars less if bought online. Leather soles and uppers, plus the item is ""airport friendly"" since no steel shanks are used in the construction of the boots. Well fitting and comfortable even when worn for the first day. Looks good, too!"
4,Works wonderfuly,"Unit is well built, with plenty of space for my bigger power bricks. I had to pick up a different one from the store last time because they were out of this one, and was not nearly as happy. I think it was a dynex, but the large brick plugs on that one are too close together.The lie-flat power cable is nice, plus the fact that the 3 prong at the end is at a right angle as well, so the cable points down towards the floor and can be squished behind the couch/etc easily.The only drawback is that the plastic thingy at the end that holds the cables doesn't keep them retained particularly well. Many power cables are quite, so it they can pop out easily when you are setting things up. Still, it is better to have this little piece than not, just wish it was bigger, or the to prongs on top overlapped like a keyring."
4,Drums for the novice,"Excelent video for anyone starting to play the drums , Paul Murski takes you on a simple basic approach to several music styles , the split screens and the 1,2,3,4 steps are easy to follow ( yet difficult to master )if you have your drums set in front of the TV you can quickly catch on , I don`t give it 5 stars , because I think it lacks (since its so basic ) a little explanation on the basics , such as how to hold the sticks , hit the drums , arrange them , etc.. still , an excelent purchase"
4,Its ok . Good for beginners,"Its ok . Good for beginners , mostly flat out drumming styles and beats .Nothing about transitioning or a few rolls in between thos would have been good to have.-Sundru"
2,Not so kid friendly,I was hoping to use this video w/ my kids- isn't really directed towards a younger audience
4,Excellent,An excellent war film - actually one of the best I've seem. Four & a half stars IMO. Very well written with good acting.
4,Nalta Story,It is a good war film of Word War 11 with good acting and story plot. I would recommend it to war film fans.
5,Worth Every Penny,"We use this every day. Coffee in the morning (french press) and for tea at night. The machine keeps the water ready. It makes life easier. No more turning on the stove, putting the teapot on, waiting, coming back when it whistles, then having boiling hot water. The WATER is ready at 203 degrees F or 140F if you prefer warm water ON DEMAND. The only thing you have to do is fill it when it is empty. Keep it plugged in and it is your workhorse. Haven't had a problem in over a year of use so far. I don't expect any. Very happy. The price seems high but how much is your time worth?"
4,Slam dunk for Zojirushi!,"Those wily guys at Zojirushi have done it again, but this time, with PIZAZZ! Buying this dispenser not only saved my marriage, but it brought me closer to my son, James, who can't stop talling his friends about this thing. No kidding!"
3,A solid textbook,This is a well written and clearly organized book on communication in organizational settings. It includes the necessary primers of organizational theory to allow the student reader enough background to learn about and discuss the topic without any prerequisite reading. This is an appropriate text for a graduate level course in the title subject or as a reference for related courses
2,organizational communication used,"The previous owner underlined everything in this text making it difficult to read. The main reason the underlining and notes written were such a distraction is because they hindered the text, the lines were sloppy and covered some of the printed words. While the physical condition of the cover and the pages was mint, the underlining ruined this text."
2,Not my kind of 'dramatic electronic music',"Being quite fond of Berlin school ambient (the likes of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze) I thought 00/44 would go along similar lines. In some ways, it does. However, I was still quite disappointed.The record mainly consists of very random, slowly progressing synthesizer sounds and notes which supposedly sound 'eerie' and 'dramatic'. It does not have any chord progressions nor arpeggios, like most of the other Berlin School records have - just eerie notes with eerie, dissonant intervals. As there is basically no structure, the music should be very ambient in nature. Unfortunately it was not the type of ambient I was looking for (invigorating or relaxing). Rather, this is a somewhat upsetting, chaotic record, and not meant for everyone. If you enjoyed Vangelis's 'Invisible Connections' (another record I rejected for similar reasons), you might enjoy this one too."
4,The great cryptogram: Francis Bacon's cipher in the so-calle,"I really liked this book, because it was packed full of so much information. I used it for an English project on Shakspearen authorship and Francis Bacon played a huge role in Shakespeares life. I will refer this book to anyone."
5,Late 70's O'Jays Best Album,"Early 70's O'Jays Back Stabbers was great, then this late 70's was romantic and the beginning of the ""For Lovers Only"" format after the ""9:00 p.m."" hour. I remember me and my best friend laughing when we found out the song ""Brandy"" was about a dog!!! Still, this is one of my favorite albums by the O'Jays."
5,I love the Ojays,Ordered this cd because my favorite song is on here....Usta Be My Girl!!! I was so in love when this song came out and I only have it on 45.
5,the absolute best!,"jeez im 64 now and have had a crush on eddie for all my life! they sing with so much soul that when i hear certain songs (ship ahoy) its easy for me to get the chills and tear up.in fact, i cant think of one song that i dislike period!"
4,A little Better,"This one was a little better for the O'Jays, and they even got a big hit with ""Use Ta Be My Girl"". The only really thing that's wrong is that the social conscious material was gone. I think maybe because by this time disco was in super bloom, and no one wanted to hear anything else. But with that being said, it was good to see the O'Jays put out a very good record"
1,"Rating for Amazon, not the product.","As mentioned by others, Amazon recommends you buy this product along with the Bosch 10.8 volt pocket driver. As also was stated, this chuck is not compatible with the pocket driver. My teenage son bought me the pocket driver and the chuck for Christmas. He thought the chuck was actually a drill bit chuck, which would allow me to use the pocket driver as a cordless drill. Obviously he didn't read the description closely, as this is not a drill bit chuck. My issue is with Amazon suggesting this product as a companion to the pocket driver. Even if it did fit the pocket driver, why would you need an add-on ""Clic-Change"" chuck for a device that has a ""Clic-Change"" chuck already built into it? In this case, Amazon needed to do a better job knowing what it was recommending to its customers."
4,Great Set but Note Compatiblity,"I bought the Pocket Driver from Bosch, and you can see that this set is paired with that particular product. So I bought this set to go along with my new pocket drill. I may be not seeing how they go together, but the chuck stem does not fit in the pocket driver head. It works well with a regular chuck drill, and is a breeze changing bits. It is just a tug and snap to change bits and that makes every job easier when you don't have to loosen/tighten the chuck with each change. Check for compatibility with your type of drill before purchasing."
5,"Buy this now, if you currently have the traditional keyed chuck!","This is a great way to upgrade from the archaic keyed-chuck. I currently only own the four bits that came with this Bosch kit, but it's compatible with ALL makes/models of hex shank bits. They're a bit more costly than traditional bits, but in my opinion, the convenience (and cool factor) makes it worth it."
5,Best ever quick-change chuck!,"I have at least a half dozen of these chucks in various brands but the Bosch Clic-Change chuck is the best for several reasons. Aside from the top quality construction, the way it holds all bits securely and lack of run out, it is the only truly one-handed adapter that I've come across. When you release the bit by pulling on the rubber padded collar, it pops the bit loose so you can pull it out with the same hand. The chuck stays in the release position and you just push the new bit in and the chuck locks it in place. It seems so simple but I promise you it will save you time as well as the hassle of having to hold the spring-loaded type release of most other brands with one hand while removing or inserting the various bits with the other. I've since added this chuck to all of the drills I commonly use. Anyone want some free non-Bosch quick-change chucks?"
5,Bosch clic change system is fortunately a standard,"The Bosch clic change also has a very intuitive method of working. Inserting a new bit into it is easy. The bit goes in and in the same movement, you continue right over the bit to the head of the clic change system, seating it down and locking it. When you want to remove the bit, you pull the head outwards, and once again in a single stroke remove the bit at the same time. Leave it to Bosch to make on of the best designed systems.The good thing about the Bosch is that it accepts 1/4"" head bits from a lot of different manufacturers available locally.I also bought the Bosch 27 piece clic change set with this one, and then discovered the wide array of 1/4"" devices with the same head configuration.All in all, the Bosch holds the bit very true and won't slip out. Yet the bits come on and off easily. Very nice unit, highly recommended."
4,Same as the Kobalt,The Kobalt (Lowes) is the same as this Bosch - but for half the price. It's a very handy thing to have if you need to drive various kinds of fasteners. The only negative is the blue rubber thingy tends to get pushed off in tight spots and I'm sure it will eventually get lost or ruined.
2,Click Change Chuck,Pros:Bits are from Good quality. Can be used on a 10mm driller (driver).Cons:Do not fit a 1/4 inch driver.
3,1993 version is not the original...the 11 track 1992 is,"1993 version is not the original...the 11 track 1992 is. The disc has all of the early 90s Rave classics that have stood the test of time but the 1993 version does not have the the original 1st track of the 92 version..""O Fortuna"" which may be most influential 90s techno rave song ever created. be warned there are 2 versions of the 1992 version...10 tracks and 11 tracks...the 11 track version is the original i fell in love with in 1992 while living in philadelphia. this disc is still good. I give it 3 stars...while the 11 track 1992 version gets 5 stars in my book."
5,Ditto,"This was my very first Techno/Rave TAPE I ever bought... I was hooked from the beginning... I wore the tape out and had to buy it again... this time the cover was blue... missing The Movements Jump (Mutha mix) :<( Still, a truly awsome Cd for anyone who likes hardcore/trance/Rave muzik. Came out in '92 but the artists on there came out between '91 and '92. Great variety of sub styles."
4,Back when,I remember listening to this CD when I was a little kid. It basically has shaped my musical taste to what it is now. My brother found it on the beach one day and brought it home. I was in love with it. Thyen it dissapeared again. I still have the happy face in my head from the CD face.
5,One of the best rave cd's out there,"This is one of my first Rave cd's, and I got hooked on it. I've bought it more than once (hint: it never gets old). There are many differend types of songs and sounds, all high energy. I would recomend this to anyone. You've probably heard some of these songs, but all of them are good. You won't regret buying this."
1,"Rave music, I think not","I dont know what types of raves these people go to, but Im glad I dont. The music on this CD is very unoriginal, and very un creative. I fyou want good music outside of a rave, I suggest something more along the lines of Paul Oakenfold, or Paul Van Dyke, or maybe even a little Northern Exposure. Keep on Raven Ravers, Peace."
1,junk,"I tend to agree with Tranquillitatis..... this is RAVE music?? I think not!!! I don't know what they were thinking when they titled this CD that way. I'm an old school raver all grown up...going back to the late 80's and I never heard this music at any party I went to.Its cheesy...dated...and fluffy. It's the stuff played at mainstream, meat market nightclubs of the early 90's. Now.....that being said.....if that the type of music you liked back then...or now...its right up your alley. I have to give it one star because its not even close to the title!!!!!"
4,Works!,Does the job. Fits the saw.easy to install.Not much needs to be said about a stupid dado blade insert. Amazon insists that reviews need to be at least twenty words. I hope this is enough.
3,Too narrow for some dado sets,"Well this is just a piece of metal to fit a hole. But it is too narrow for some dado set if using all the blades at once, like this one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000223VZ/ref=oh_o01_s00_i01_detailsIt still works fine otherwise and adjusts perfectly into the Bosch table saw."
2,Poor fit,"This does not fit my Bosch 4000-09 very well at all. I have to use a piece of scrap or a rubber mallet to hammer it in to place, and it's very difficult if not impossible to level due to that. I'm rather disappointed in this insert. I will probably be making my own out of plywood going forward."
3,it's a dado insert,"It's like the normal insert but for a dado blade. Not much to say or rate about. It holds just fine. I like that it's plastic because I have, in the past, had to cut a larger slot into my table saw inserts for more advanced cuts."
1,"Cheap, flimsy and plastic","I looked at this and decided not to use it. I've kept it as a pattern and made my own out of 3/8 ply.Anyway, dado blades are set to different widths, you need different inserts for each width, and this is just one width, too wide for many uses."
3,"Dado Insert is Fine, but the Arbor is a Problem with 3/4"" dados","I purchased the 4100 table saw and the dado insert and I am generally very pleased with both. However when I put my Freud dado set on the arbor, any chipper blade that is positioned where the arbor threads start is loose on the shaft. It appears that the shaft diameter is about 1/32"" under size at this point, due to the start of the threads. This causes the chipper blade to run slightly off centre, making a mess of the bottom of the dodo cut.I have tried several different dado sets and this problem is definitely with the arbor and not the blades. As long as the dado is narrower than 1/2"" this isn't an issue because the blades positions are on the arbor before the narrow point. But cuts between 1/2"" and 13/16"" (the maximum cut that Bosch sates is allowed) are always a mess. (And yes you need to swap the washers or you have even a bigger mess)So over all I rate the saw and insert as okay, but not great if you need to do dadoes."
5,Very Pleased,There is no source for Bosch parts in my town so I was very pleased that this order arrived in two days.
3,Watch the friction tab,The friction tab was doubled over and luckily I was able to bend it back without breaking the spring steel. If they packaged it better this would avoid the damage. The plate levels well to the table and does the job. There is a slight high middle that has worn the paint off in less than 20 passes to make 8 tenons. Otherwise its a nice fit and does the job. Comes with a thin washer so you can get the full dado set of bades on the saw.
4,Just what we needed,"Before buying this, we made do with a ""homemade"" dado insert made out of particle board. Needless to say, this is much more secure - it fits flush to the table, or perhaps a tad below, so it does not cause the wood to catch. Worked exactly as described."
4,Info on how to use dado Insert,"Dado insert was functional. It fit properly. To use a 13/16"" dado stack with this insert on your saw you need to do this. (Per Bosch Tool customer service)Thank you for writing Bosch Power Tools. When mounting dado blades onthe Bosch 4000 table saw, follow this procedure which was omitted fromthe owners manual. This saw will handle up to a 13/16"" wide dado blade.Remove both blade washers from the arbor shaft. Install & use the Outerwasher as the Inner washer, than[sic] mount your dado blade set, than[sic]install the lock nut. An outer washer is not needed for a dado set. Thisprocedure will provide proper spacing of your dado blade set. Changingblades can be a bit tight, but if you insure the blade is elevated to it'smaximum height you shouldn't have any problem. The reason for this isbecause the dust containment shroud is rather close to the blade tocontain saw dust from blowing all over the place. If you have any furtherquestions, please write back."
1,Dado insert,"Disappointed with the insert. Love the saw and the stand. The dado insert only allows a 1/2"" cut. A 3/4"" dado setup rubs against the insert. You'd need to take the stabilizer off to have the blades be centered. It's as if no one tried it after it was developed."
3,Second one works fine,"Well, the first one I received was bent -- laying it face down on the table top, it would rock considerably. If adjusted so the front and back edge were in line with the table, it was high in the center. I figured that would probably throw my cuts off, so I just shipped it back. Amazon had a flat replacement at my door a few hours after I managed to drop the old one in the mail. The replacement works great, and I'd probably rate it 4 stars if the first one hadn't been bent. Also, considering that the manual for the saw itself says very little about mounting a dado stack, it might be nice if the insert gave you some more info. I had to email Bosch tech support to get the secret for getting beyond 1/2""."
1,Don't bother,"After struggling somewhat with fitting it and the dado blade to the drive, I decided it would be better to use it as a good template for my own homemade Insert."
5,Dado Insert No. TS 1007 for Bosch Table Saw,"This is a metal dado cutter insert to allow you to safely make dados using a Bosch Table Saw. It is bright red, making it easy to locate when you set it somewhere, and mine required no adjusting to make it flush with the saw table surface--it has four set screws to adjust the height. No one could beat Amazon's price of $9.74 and since I ordered it with the saw there were no taxes or shipping expenses. I ordered it on January 30, Amazon quoted a delivery by February 14, and I received it before February 10. This accessory works great and you really must have it if you are going to do any dado work with your Bosch saw."
2,Be Careful,"This insert was designed for the older Bosch saw. The newer model has an improved splitter knife that attaches over the blade and has it's attachment hardware alongside the blade. This The new saw requires a slot off the back of the insert to accomodate the new blade splitter knife. The manual specifies the TS1007. However, the wweb site for Bosch shows the insert with the slot. I did not find this out until I tried to use it. A call to Bosch Tech support told me that the picture on the web site was wrong and I had to remove the knife to use the insert. Frankly I think they are trying to sell off all the old inserts before issuing the new. You can use it if you remove the knife. This is a little time consuming and adds to the setup time. I am not happy with Bosch!"
5,"Really, really loved this book!",The story held my attention from the beginning to the satisfying end. I loved all of the characters (even the secondary ones were great!) Linda Broday has become and auto-buy for me and I wish she'd write more!
2,"cute, but not comfortable","Sheet set was bright and really cute, but scratchy and not comfortable until about ten washings."
5,"Very hot, agressive","This is not for romantic readers. It is straight at you, aggressive sex. Very nicely done and very erotic. Just keeps building and building. May definitely offend some reader's sensibilities since it is about domination and submission. A real turn on."
2,You call this a book?,"I have read a lot of erotic fiction. This book is the least erotic book I have ever read. One reviewer said it took a day and a half to read. Is that person learning disabled? This book is short and BORING. Absolutely nothing erotic about it. The sex scenes were practically clinical in their descriptions. ""She had three orgasms."" What a joke!!!! I would never buy another book by this author. As a matter of fact, you couldn't GIVE me another book by this author. If you want good erotic fiction, try something by Robin Schone or Maya Banks. This author is crap."
3,Turned on,Turned Out is a wanton tale of lust and lots of sex. The plot is about as beleivable as a soap opera with un-censored sex scenes. The book is a fast read and is fairly entertaining. Not the best erotica ever written but decent for effort and imagination.
4,Turned Out,Enjoyable short story of a modest girl turning into a sexual nymphomaniac. A little short in length but the writing was enjoyable.
2,Oh please!,"I agree with some of what others have said, ""over the top,"" and ""ridiculous."" I didn't find it funny, though, just silly. Yes, it's a quick read, and it will turn you on, but it's annoying. Not well written, unbelievable, totally one-dimensional characters. The boyfriend is really not to be believed! Well, maybe it's a guy thing....:)"
5,"Simmons uses humor, clarity, to talk about games people play","Simply put, reading this book helped me see more--in terms of my own behavior and others'. Ever looked back on tough work situations you've dealt with in the past and thought 'How ridiculous I was then...if only I knew then what I knew now, I'd have acted differently'? As much as I enjoyed reading the book, I must admit I felt that sting; I sat there reading about these 10 games that she has named, described (with some painfully funny stories of her own), and provided strategies for combating, and I thought 'I really needed this book years ago!' If you want to know more about how people tick and how to deal with it, get this book. Be prepared to feel stung with a higher awareness of how people operate when they are trying to protect/increase their territory in organizations--you will definitely recognize the behaviors. And more powerfully still, be prepared to have your eyes opened about some games that you, in fact, just may be playing."
3,"low-budget, but fun","This DVD can be difficult at first until you learn the moves and can anticipate the next steps. The moves are fun and up-to-date and got me sweating. I would have sweat more if I didn't have to stop when I got lost or got the moves mixed up.It's filmed in a low-budget studio of some sort, but this doesn't interfere with the quality of the recording. The instructors seem ameture, but they get the job done... and with some positive energy too."
5,Just as I remember,I loved this book and was excited to get it for our children. Great to page through and still educational.
5,Excellent challenge for kids; helps in creative thinking,"I used this book as a summer activity for my kids a number of years ago. One story would be posted on the refrigerator, and left until solved. There was no pressure, and no help. It would just sit there and pique their curiosity. They loved it, and still ask me (10 years later) if there are any more. I'm glad there are sequels now!"
3,Review,"I got this CD by mistake. I was trying to get the DVD. I'm a AFdez fan, and you have to have a special taste for the rest of the music in this CD. I guess it is OK. Get the movie instead."
1,Oh boy. Another rewrite of the manual.,Don't bother with this unless you pirated the software. Then you deserve whatever you ger.
3,retro,I grew up listening to this music.Brings back good memories.Listen to it in my car on long trips to other states.
5,Gift,This makes a great gift and good company for music fans. I like it because it caters to all types of listeners.
5,I Love a March...,The pieces recorded here give a good picture of the range of march music. These two disks are the mark of a good anthology of marches.
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful teaching tool. I own several belly dancing teaching DVDs and this is by far the best. Ms. Mor makes you feel as if she is right there in your home, you would swear she is speaking directly to you. The moves are explained very well, in such a way that you feel you *can* do this, even when you feel clumsy at first. It is the most comprehensive DVD I have seen, when you are through you will have all the basics down and then some. Ms. Mor is very encouraging, understanding first the frustration and and then the elation when it comes together for you. I highly recommend it for all beginner and intermediate dancers!"
3,Not the best,"Amira Mor has a different title to all of her bellydance videos, but the content is pretty much the same for all. It says ""Bellydance Your Way To Fitness"", but I seriously doubt doing this video alone will get you fit at all. She teaches the moves pretty well and at a good pace to get the hang of them, but the video is VERY low, almost pornographic, quality. Amira is sometimes confused, and it's hard to tell whether she just made this video spontaneously or she just can't remember the English language. While I don't have any major complaints about what is taught here, I think the quality of video and teacher make other videos much more worth the money than this one. If you find this for a very low price and have never watched a belly dance instructional video you may enjoy it, but for anyone who has seen other videos this will be a huge disappointment."
4,Essence of the Church,"The most straight ""rock"" album from the Church. Great guitar album with plenty of pop tunes, riffs, and thoughtful lyrics. One of their best."
1,Not what I expected!,"I was excited to try these out for the first time, and they did not perform as I expected. The rubber pad marred the melamine cabinets I was installing, and they never pulled the cabinets flush. I ended up using my quick grip clamps and a little elbow grease, which worked perfectly. I will probably never use these again, what a waste of $60!"
2,Choppers-World of Custom Motorcycles,"Extremely poor sound quality . . . bad recording or reproduction, renders the video not watchable."
2,"Fun Activities, Dowdy Design","The activities in the book are, in fact, fun, but the lack of color and poor layout make the book difficult to fully appreciate."
5,just hot,"I bought mine last summer on vacation in Seattle.It never gets unplugged in our home. We use it in the mornings to make instant oatmeal, on some weekends to make miso and mungbeans noodles soup and in the evenings to make 2 pots of tea. I have actually given my kettle away."
5,Great book!,"Simple, clear and profound! You'll want to read this over and over! This one goes on my ""one of the best books I've ever read"" list."
1,Disappointing New Age Cult Manifesto,"I bought this book in the hopes of finding some personal spiritual guidance. Instead, I found a poorly written, thinly veiled marketing ploy for a cult based in Colorado."
4,THE BEST BAND OF THE NINENTIES IS SPANISH.,"Watch out for this incredible debut. These guys from Granada really broke my heart. This first album change the concept of Popular music. QUE PUEDO HACER has become the hymn of the last indie generation in Spain. This band built itself playing in FIB, they have repeat every year and the fibers love them. If you want to feel a new experience just call your girl, get stoned and listen to this one. You will never go back."
5,"The Best Culture Club Album! ""Colour By Numbers""","This is the best album from 80's. With good compositions, it made a big success and put Boy George on TOP Ten hits. Great songs, different videoclips; the best Culture Club album! Buy it, it's very cool!"
3,Colour by Numbers,"OK CD.Brings back A LOT of memories (like when I had this ON TAPE!!).There's so many songs by Culture Club I wanted, I got their Best Of/Greatest Hits as well.Good CD though."
3,Thickness range different than advertised,"The thickness of the feeler gauges were different from what was advertised. The KD 165 is advertised with a thickness range from 0.015 to 0.045 inches. The sizes are 0.020, 0.025, 0.028, 0.030, 0.032, 0.034, 0.035, 0.040. There is no 0.015 or 0.045 inch thickness gauges. (I wanted the 0.045"" gauge.) Still, it's a good tool if the CORRECT range is what you need. Also, this rating reflects the incorrect advertising, not the quality of the gauge."
2,incomplete,"I'm not one to complain for something not being perfect, but this item came without the electrode adjuster, which is very disappointing and surprising. There are four wire gauges on each side, so I'm not sure how the electrode adjuster would have fit without making the two plates uneven. either way, I think the gauges are fine, I just can't understand how in the world this was packaged without being complete--the packaging even says it comes with the adjuster!I could return this to amazon, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble. it's probably best to just go to the store and pick up one of the other types of wire gauges. should've done that in the first place. amazon's a big place, and all these manufacturers and models sometimes get mixed in the fold. save yourself the time, make a trip to the parts store"
2,Time for Summer..,"The Chaperone with WWE star Triple H, needs to rush to summer recess. The story line was boring. It is the same as any other starting out in prison. The daughter/ father 'I don't want you' line. Triple H, though a star in the squared ring, has only 1 facial expression that he looks like he is comfortable with, anger. Like many of the other WWE stars, few have been able to truly meld into the large screen with any grace other than that of a gorilla. My suggestion is for Triple H to keep is energy to wrestling."
3,Surprisingly Good,"I went into this movie with low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. Triple H is very likable, and the story - while predictable - isn't half bad. If you're a WWE fan or you are just looking for a pretty good family action film, you could do far worse than this film. I recommend renting it."
5,arlinda's review,love this movie. he turned his life around for his daughter and reunited with his ex. great job triple h.
5,Beautiful!!,Another great set of songs by the Songbirds of Italy. Their appeal is worldwide. I love their energy and unique style.
3,Could be better,"Bender's physical appearance is fine. The overall construction is as well, however you can see some glue at the seams of his arms and legs. My Bender's feet are not quite level (I guess I was just unlucky) but they are very close to it, making it very easy for him to lean against anything with little effort so he can stand. Coin space is satisfactory considering the logical space allowed. No matter what I do his head comes off way too easily. It should be a bit more firm as I have already beheaded him several times. And always with the possibility of coins falling out of him when I knock him down.Overall fine product, just needs a little work."
2,Not lovin it.,"I bought this phone to replace a 2.4 ghz Motorola that the buttons were sticking on. The static starts when you get further than 15 feet away from the base unit- I used to be able to walk my dog in front of the house with my Motorola!I tried moving the base away from my PC as suggested (it's a home office, how far can I move it?)"
1,Awful! Worst Phone I have ever Owned!,"To make a long story short, these phones produce so much static you can not hear the person you are talking to and vice versa. I would not recommend these phones to anyone, friend or foe. I got ripped off along with the others that have reviewed this product. Bad, Bad and Bad! Just save your money! Awful! I wish I could of given this product a negative 1, it does not deserve a one star rating!"
1,2 handsets but can't talk at the same time,"from the manual:""Make sure the other handset is not already in use. Two or more handsets cannot be in talk at the same time""Basically, if one person is already talking on HS1 and you want to use the second handset to join that conversation, it's not possible. huge drawback for a multi-station phone, you can only TRANSFER the call, but you can't both be talking at the same time.Range is a huge issue too, about 10 feet away from the base in a house with no TV or anything plugged into the electricity, and there is strong static, just from the walls.. not recommended."
1,I Can't Hate a Phone More Than This,"These weren't too bad at first- and then, all of a sudden, the static. We've tried everything- and we paid $50 or $60 for these, not $30. Turns off with face, too. Every time I pick up the handset and hear the static, I get red faced. I'm smashing these on the curb when the new Panasonic Dect 6.0's arrive.Never again, Uniden!"
1,not a good phone,"I just received this phone and it is terrible. The sound of the person on the other line is muffled (I tried it with a variety of callers and it was poor quality in all cases). Also, I proped the phone under my neck and it hung up the call. Got static going into the downstairs room. I will be returning this phone!"
1,Too much static,"I got this phone from a friend. I thought it would be a nice upgrade to my existing eight year old GE phones. I was appalled at how poor the sound quality is. As just about everyone else has stated, the static gets unbearable once you are more that ten feet from the base unit. Pretty poor. I could use my GE phones outside a good 100' from the house with no problem. These phones are trash. I have never had Uniden before. I can only assume this model is representative of their entire product line; as such I will never buy Uniden."
2,Dusty like no other.,"These pads could be of good quality but produce too much dust, if your car is equipped with steel wheels then it could be ok however if your car has alloy wheels you should look at other brands. i'm not making this up these pads produce at least 60% more dust than original equipment."
4,Owner,"Overall a very good product. This stand is a very heavy duty design and has very little wobble or instability. I purchased it to make it easier to use bench top power tools such as a Delta 13"" planer and PerformaX 10-20 drum sander. These seem to get a bit heavier ever time I go to heft them from their storage places to the work bench. The low height setting of the Delta stand makes it somewhat easier to shift from storage to the work stand and then elevate the stand along with the tool to a desired work height.The hold-down bolt design is a bit difficult to utilize and, hence, encourages use of the tools with out bolting them to the stand. Also the lift cylinder could use a bit more upward pressure but these are not major negatives."
5,love it,"I love it . It works great, you can leave the saw on it and roll it around, load it on a truck, whatever. Just right."
5,Fabulous Toy,"I bought this miter table for my husband. He saw it on the show, Cool Tools and of course had to have it. What he said about the table is that it's on wheels and can be easily stored. I agree with this because our house has limited space."
2,TOO HEAVY,Nice piece of STEEL. Had it been made with aluminum they would have a winner. I kept the heavy lug wish I would have returned the stand.
4,very good stand,"The 36-136 is a very good and sturdy stand. I was a little concerned about the stability, but it has exceeded my expectations. Easy to assemble and easy to use/store. It has quality materials and is very well built. My only suggestion is larger wheels, and it is heavy to open for the first 6-10 inches. The ability to fold it and store it on end is a great feature to save space in the shop."
1,Disappointing,"My Dewalt planer would not fit this stand without hours of work. Once mounted, it seemed great but it is too damned heavy for an old man (or a young one with a bad back). After I planed some boards today the lock will not release so I can lower it for storage. Help in the manual or on Delta's website? None to be had. The dealer from whom I bought this just went out of business. I'll call Delta's 800# Monday. Any buyers out there? Great mobile stand: heavy duty."
2,Daily on site use is too much for this stand.,"I purchased this stand to go with my Hitachi 10"" slider. Out of the box it seemed like a great product. Easy set-up/breakdown, and I liked the way the supports didn't have legs to the ground to allow quick adjustment. After about a month of daily use on the job the locking mechanism has started to fail. The little lever you pull to unlock the system to fold the stand has stopped working. I removed the plastic cover over the mechanism, and found it to be very poorly designed. It seemed like it was thrown together as an afterthought, with odd springs and too many moving parts. Since folding the stand up is one of the most important parts of the stand, this is a deal killer. I'm taking it back, and going to give the Ridgid stand a try."
4,junkhater,"Agree with the majority here. This is a JEWEL for me. Have owned for three months, do not use daily, only use once weekly so fold up and down has not shown weaknesses that others are having. Recommend as ""an occasional use item"" that should please for many years, thus 4 of 5."
4,Solid stand,"Heavy, well made stand that should fit most 10"" and under miter saws. Some 12"" saws may be a little big and some components may extend beyond the edges of the stand.One of the rollers was jammed on mine when it arrived, appears to be either shipping or packing problem. Delta is shipping a replacement roller to me to correct this."
2,A few Problems but a decent stand overall.,"Setup was a snap except that it had a defective part on the roller guide bars. After several calls to delta and numerous efforts to clearly communicate what part was defective ... I finally talked to someone who was able to get the part to me.The release mechanism is a weak design and hangs up or doesn't release well.3 stars taken off due to defective quality control, bad Delta support, and Delta not honoring their rebate.The stand is very sturdy when upright and compact when folded and able to handle whatever equipment I install on it.It is heavy, so loading and unloading it on a regular basis is ill advised. However the weightiness directly translates to stability and overall sturdiness."
3,Delta 36-136 review,"This would be a great table for someone with a large workshop. When folded up, the table resembles a 2-wheeler, I liked that it had a pneumatic assisted raising mechanism. The product is very well made and can be easily moved because of the wheels attached to one end of the stand.I sold the table one week after receiving it. I need to carry my tools from job to job. It takes up too much room in my truck. the table itself weighs over 60 pounds. With a my Makita saw mounted to it, it weighed well over 100 pounds!I opted for a lightweight Wolcraft table. It folds up and fits nicely in my truck. The tool fastening method is also very easy to disengage."
3,Too many flaws for me,"There are just too many problems with this stand to make it useable for someone who makes money with tools. It is not nearly as easy to collapse and erect as the gravity folding stands that are out now, the extensions take a lot of time to set correctly because they sag the further out you go, and you have to adjust the supports each time you move them. You have to put weight on them to set them up which makes it much harder to set the supports. The supports are tightened with a system that really sticks, sticks so much that it is very difficult to adjust them up and down. When you tighten them they are fine - if you are lucky enough to adjust them perfectly. This stand may work fine for most, but not if you move it often and are particular. My Rigid is easy to fold and erect and the extensions and supports are easy to set up. I haven't tried the Bosch gravity miter stand yet, but it looks much better."
5,Compete bibliography of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs,"Bob Zeuschner has produced the best bibliography of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs since Henry Heins. A constant and often accessed resource, it is my most utilitized ERB reference. Even more special, I have an autographed edition!!!"
2,Lacking in some features,"I bought this item locally with some expectation of a good Sony product. The unit works as specified. Since it has independent 4 charging slots, it is lacking indicators for each slot to show that the battery is seated properly. When one set of batteries are done and you insert a second set, it does not start charging unless the power is removed and reconnected."
2,"Comfortable, but already falling apart...","I love the look of this shoe, but after only wearing them a few hours, the lining is already falling out."
2,Not as good as the other Madison Finn books (2 1/2 stars),"Usually, I like to read books from the Madison Finn series as a quick, light read. However, I didn't find this book to be as fun or fast-paced as the other books. The book seemed to drag along. Madison seemed a bit overly obsessed with the ""Crime Time"" show, and Crime Time's host, Major deMille. I also thought the whole plot with Mariah Diaz's friend Penelope and the missing sheet music wasn't all that engaging."
2,Not a good book,I did not like this book. It dragged out to long and had no point. and it was an irritating book. I know Laura Dower can write better.
4,Nice Pants,"I really like these pants and would give them 5 stars but they are short. I do not normally wear my pants--yoga nor workout--around my hips--which is where these are worn in the advertised pictures. I would like to order another pair if they were just a bit longer. As they are, I love to wear them around the house and have done yoga in them--however, they are too short to wear shopping or out to lunch:-/ I am only 5'6"". So if they were longer--even by 2 inches--I would order 2 more pair:-) They wash up nicely--I hang them to dry--and they turn out great:-)"
4,A Great Summer Read,"I enjoyed this book very much. The woman in the book is a college professor and very pregnant. She falls for her ""student"" who is really an undercover cop. Still, she doesn't know and the moral dilema is interesting. The cop finds her extremely sexy and attractive which is a switch from the normal slim, leggy, perfect females in most of these romance books. In any case, I recommend it. It is a quick read and not educational in the least- but fun!"
4,Good historical introduction,I found the extensive introductory material more informative than the script itself.
3,"Sinead's a little more than ""Nothing Compares 2 U""","Sinead O'Connor has one of the most distinctive voices in pop music, and her songwriting can be quite interesting. I can remember hearing ""Mandinka"" for the first time and just being totally blown away. Unfortunately, Sinead to the average person is little more than a one-hit wonder with asinine politics. It's a shame, because this collection shows what a lot of Sinead fans have always known--she could have been a superstar if she'd just kept her mouth shut except when singing!"
5,"Love Her Or Hate Her, Sinead's Catalog Rocks","So far..is what the public needs to remember just what a truly remarkable talent Sinead O'Connor is. She ditched fame as fast as she gained it; but along the bumpy, misunderstood way, She made some great music. Appropriately opening with ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", a song that is still as startling as it was a decade ago; so far chronicles a body of work that explores the darkest pit of the human heart. ""Troy"" is as equally haunting if not more and moved up Sinead's ever growing studio experimentation; as with the case in such tunes as ""Fire On Babylon"" and ""I Want Your Hands On Me"". No need to rehash her tumultuous past; So Far deals with it and somehow seems to close the book on the pain. Sinead will always be the most mysterious and Joan Of Arc-ish entertainer of our time."
4,"REALLY, VERY DEEP","I THINK SINEAD IS AN AMAZING SONG WRITER, SHE CAN NOT ONLY CARRY A GOOD TUNE BUT HER LYRICS ARE AMAZING.HER SONG ""BLACK BOYS ON MOPEDS"" IS A REALLY TOUCHING SONG. THAT MIGHT SOUND REALLY CORNY, BUT IT IS. THAT SONG INCLUDING MANY OTHER SONGS."
5,Amazing Rosary CDs!,This is a set of two CDs. On one CD is our beloved Pope John Paul II (now Blessed)reciting the rosary in Latin. On the second CD a priest recites the rosary in English. After a couple of plays you will be able to follow the Pope in Latin which is the original language of the Catholic Church. Both help the listener to focus on the mysteries as they pray the rosary. Very happy with this purchase.
2,"Starts out slow, doesn't go anywhere","This is one of those books that I felt obligated to finish, because I had read the first half. The book follows a chronically depressed character from boring engagement to boring engagement, and occasionally wanders off into random thoughts about how awful life is. Maybe I'm missing something important in the novel, but I pretty much doubt it. Definitely not worth the time invested to read it."
5,True to info given,"This book came in the condition indicated. Shipped quickly, with no troubles. I had all the info I needed prior to ordering, no surprises."
2,Not worth all the hype,"I found this book very boring and pointless. I kept hoping that the story would pick up or the ending would be exciting but I was left unimpressed. Many new characters and story lines were introduced in each new chapter, yet they never went anywhere. The novel was written well, but left me uninterested."
5,Been a long long time,"Had this album when it first came out. Loved!!it, but lost it in a divorce in 1981, then more or less forgot about it except for the frequent times the songs came to play in my head. Finally tried to download it, no luck. My tech savvy son was perplexed when he couldn't find it either since everything is available, isn't it? Finally found the overseas cd, and read earlier comments that Grace didn't like her solo work so it wasn't easily available, but I'm not sure why she feels that way. This album is WONDERFUL. Just as I remembered. It's like a full album of Grace's voice at White Rabbit level/intensity. If you are searching this site for Dreams you are a Grace fan. BUY it."
4,Awesome,This is an excellent read and very informational. I would suggest this book to any true Bible believing child of God who is interested in growing in the knowledge of the Old Testement. Awesome!
5,Talmud study,The author has taken great pain to summarize the views of the Rabbis on a variety of subjects. It enhances the study of the Talmud enormously.
5,Great book....honest account of Talmud.....not sanitized,"Everyman's Talmud is fine reading for beginners interested in what the Talmud is all about. I'm sorry to see that ""Beth"" thinks this book is a sanitized and dishonest account of the Talmud. Unfortunately there is a lot of anti-Jewish sentiment on the internet these days. For those interested in the ""TRUTH ABOUT THE TALMUD"", which exposes the narishkeit (nonsense) that our friend ""Beth"" here has copied-and-pasted, read here:http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/"
4,Good book for basic knowledge,"This book provides a good knowledge of the basic doctrines in the Rabbinic writings. It shows how meticulous the Jewish rabbis were in their study and exegeting of the Tanakh. It is apparent that these sages took the commandment of the Lord to Joshua to heart (Joshua 1:8). Abraham Cohen does an excellent job in organinzing material and backing up his words with many quotes from the rabbinic writings. For me as a gentile believer in the Jewish Messiah Yeshua it challenges me to study the word of God. However it saddens me to see this detailed of study but to see the Jewish people miss the revelation of Yeshua as Messiah. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a basic understanding of what the Rabbinic traditions teaches. ""Hear Oh Israel the Lord our God, the Lord is one."" Duet. 6:4"
5,A very helpful work for the ' reader',"By organizing the words of the Talmud into 'topics' or 'themes' and collecting together teachings from various tractates Abraham Cohen provides an excellent means for most readers to learn what the Talmud says in many areas of life. Traditional ' learning' is a different story entirely and involves going through each tractate as it is written. And while the Tractates are organized around subjects they often contain much diverse matter. Also ' learning 'them involves an intense kind of study most often with a ' chavruta' or learning partner, or in another framework with others. That kind of study is much different from simply reading as it involves a much more slower, more difficult and deep process of intellectual understanding. This work is a good one for the ' reader' but ' learning' as such requires a different kind of investment and effort."
4,very useful cookware,"In Taiwan and Japan, almost every kitchen is equipped with a thermal cooking pot and this one is the most popular one in Taiwan. But you have to pay more if you buy it there. So far, I have tried beef stew and braised pig hocks and they came out beautifully. This pot is good for anything that you have to cook for a long time, because you can cook the food in the inner pot for a short time, then put it in the outer pot and ""forget about it"". My friend cooks multi-grain porridge in the inner pot for 15 minutes and put it in the outer pot for the night and enjoys very hot delicious porridge in the morning. The trick is you have to fill it with liquid (water) almost to the top in order for the thermal process to function to the fullest extent."
4,Great cheesy B movie,"If you love B movies then this is a great one. Sure it is flawed, but that is what makes it a B movie. If you do not like B movies, then this is not for you. For the fans of MST3K, this movie is a must see."
1,Disappointing response from AMAZON.com on this item,This item has been ordered from Amazon since July 2008 and there does NOT seem to be any movement on AMAZON'S part to get it to me as the customer. I have NOT cancelled the order to see just how long they will take getting it to me.
3,Not enough massage information,"In my opinion, the first two chapters are a thorough waste of time. Reading about the philosophy is not needed to use the techniques. I thought is was a guide to using Shiatsu, not a treatise on questionable Eastern philosophy."
2,Disappointed,"I made a mistake when ordering The Book of Shiatsu. I thought I was ordering a simpler version of Shiatsu. When I tried to return it, I discovered that the cost of mailing a return would be more expensive than the cost of the book. I kept the book but I cannot make use of it. Lxx"
3,They should include a magnifying glass with this!,I bought this map after reading some of the reviews. It's a nice size and pretty much fits anywhere. At the expense of size comes text size. There is no way you can read this thing while you're driving. And the only way you can clearly read this map is when you zone in on a section that you are in and then hold that section 6 inches from your face.I'm only 25 so my eye sight is quite good but this is ridiculous. I could understand small maps for small towns or smaller cities but this is NYC...maybe the designers forgot how big and confusing NYC is.A seasoned NYC traveler could probably decipher this map but the theres waaaayyyyyy too much text all squished into this map that it is more confusing than helpful. I would look elsewhere for a map.Sure the map should be small but it should also be useful...which I don't think this is.
1,The spark plug is fine,"My beef is with this ad. It states in two places that the listing is for 4 spark plugs. Under product features it says Qty.: 4/box. Nowhere in this ad does it say this is for only one spark plug. Evidently though I live in bizzarro world where 4 means 1, as this is essentially what I was told multiple times when I contacted the company.Buyer beware, this ad is for a single spark plug only."
5,Lo mejor de INXS.,"Es mi canción favorita de INXS. Allí la voz de Michael suena cálida, sensual. Logra erizarme la piel. Es fantástico."
5,A good album for a Good Film.,"I think that, like the movie, the album is great, 'cos is a sad and wonderful album where great artist play.Its a nostalgic album for nostalgic people, during the film a very important part is that melancholy music that follow us during all the movie, and that's where the soundtrack plays a important part."
2,Putting great names together doesn't work here,"Usually, I avoid soundtrack cds, but this one was on sale and it had some great names on it. Half of the songs are ok, but putting them together on a disc doesn't make a good album. You can hear the various styles of the participating artists colliding. U2, Nick Cave, Herbert Gronemeyer, Anderson? What do these artists have in common apart from their admiration for Wim Wenders. Like the movie, the album is an artistic overkill. It's just too much. The instrumental parts at the end are a complete waste. They can't surive without the images in the movie. Avoid this album unless you want a sampler to discover some new artists. But don't play it from a to z."
1,Where was the nature photographer?? It looks like this was done in 1/2 a day,"I was so disappointed. Having been to Hawaii several times, I know there are lovely beaches, beautiful waves and incredible sunsets. This video seemed like someone had just one day to race around and quickly leap out of the car and shoot a video of several beaches. Scraggly beaches, one taken from a distance, showed far away collapsed beach umbrellas and chairs and even further away a little ocean, weird. The waves you could see at a lake, and sounded like it too. It did not seem like a nature photographer had anything to do with this."
5,Excellent Video!,"This DVD is exactly what I have been looking for. It is very relaxing and enjoyable to have on all the time. If you are looking for something soothing, and relaxing this is perfect. I hope to find another video just like this to add to my collection."
2,Plain and boring,"The blu-ray audio modes are nice, but video quality is ok; just don't compare it with BBC nature series. Beach footages pretty much were all shot from ""fixed"" spot and camera angle (i.e. 0 movement, not even a zoom in or out). It is kind of boring to watch rotation of repeated few fixed scenes, which make of the whole blu-ray. The product advertised 110 minutes play time, but it is only about 21 minutes before it starts repeating. In my opinion, this disc falls short of delivering. Save your money."
4,Two-tone beauty,"This bracelet caught my attention bec I have some 2-tone pieces (ring, earrings) without a bracelet. Since the design includes both circles and hearts, it's a lot easier to match with my stud earrings. And because it's 2-tone, it can go with either silver, white gold or yellow gold pieces. I have more options!The little bell makes quite a sound. And the bracelet is intricately made in general. It looks classy, and such a steal for the price (about $10 on sale).The only thing is, the silver part of the design sometimes gets caught with certain materials (woven cloth, other bracelets). I have NOT broken it though when I try to loosen it off. Just be gentle and patient.Bonus: all my orders from the seller arrived earlier than expected (so far). So, free standard shipping doesn't necessarily mean 2 weeks! In my case, it was just 3 days! =)"
3,Not much new here,"I was really looking forward to something new from Oldfield. I have Tubular Bells 1, 2, and 3, and just like the cover shows (I should have seen it coming), this is Tubular Bells 4. Some of the same guitar licks, sounds, beats. I was expecting it to move forward, but really, it's a retrospective, so my expectations were incorrectly set. So, get this for its own sake - the music will sound really familiar.There are many spoken and chanted parts, which sometimes help and sometimes make one cringe. In fact, I may have to drop my other Oldfield items from my wish lists. Maybe the library has them to borrow?"
1,disappointing Mike,"Mike's last opus isn't much more than a hastily completed album (maybe in fear of the millenium).Not only Mike's first albums were great but over the years he has produced some fantastic pieces (5 miles out, TB II, Amarok, The consequences of indecisions). The millenium bell - I hope - will be neglected by historians in a couple of hundred years for the good of Mike."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This album was a major disappointment... it is by far one of the worst to come from Mike Oldfield. When Mike makes an album, it's one of two extremes: amazing or downright horrible. This album fits in the latter category. Try Songs of Distant Earth or Five Miles Out if you don't have these already. Hopefully in the future Mike Oldfield will stick to the tried and tested formula rather than spew out silly stuff like this."
2,The only good thing.......,"The only good thing I found about this album was that I transposed ""Santa Maria"" onto acoustic and electric guitar and recorded it on my 4 track. The melody to that one is truly beautiful. The rest of this is not that good, and the excitment that I felt when I first spied it was deflated after the 5th or 6th listen. Definitley for the collector only."
3,Average for Oldfield,"Some artists have a scale all their own... Mike Oldfield is one such artist. A Three Star release from him might be a Four or Five Star release from most others. Still, by Oldfield standards, this wasn't his best outing.The stated purpose of 'Millenium Bell' is certainly grand; it's tries to be a musical summary of the last 1,000 years of human history. Still, when compared to Oldfield's other efforts, 'Millenium Bell' just doesn't quite measure up. The best selections on it ('Pacha Mama,' 'The Doges Palace,' and 'Millenium Bell' [a kind of summary/reprise of the album's major themes]) are a little above ""standard"" Oldfield, but the others don't quite measure up even to that average mark.The result is an album that falls in the same general ballpark as 'Earthmoving.' I think this is a better effort than 'Earthmoving,' with more musical highpoints and better display of craftsmanship, but it's no 'Ommadawn' or 'Tubular Bells III.'"
3,good on level ground,"The body of this mug is very well constructed. The handle is solid and well-placed. My only complaint is with the lid. The sliding plastic cover is somewhat flimsy and can pop off if slid too far. Additionally, the lid cover does not provide much protection from leakage. I learned that lesson with a hot cup of coffee in the lap. If you plan to keep this bad boy on your desk, this is a great mug."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Crossover Classics first volume is indeed, that. We see Superman and Spider-Man - how is that for a mismatch? Ouch! Easily this best part of this collection however, is the New Teen Titans and the X-Men story, that is most definitely entertaining, and what you want to see from one of these inter-company crossover type stunts."
4,Alba - a pleasant surprize,"I bought this cd after hearing Cocciante on ""A Christmas in Vienna"" DVD. When I got it in the mail, I was a bit disappointed that it was made in 1975. But I took a chance and kept it. I'm very glad I did. The album definitely reflects music from an earlier time - there's no disco or hard rock however. Most of the songs are simple, yet beautiful, sung from the heart. Cocciante's voice can be a bit harsh at times but usually his voice matches the music quite well. He is accompanied mainly by piano. I wouldn't recommend this album to everyone, but if you're sick of the same old stuff (with overdone instrumentals, pretentious lyrics, etc) this album may be a pleasant surprize."
4,Oldie but Goodie,I bought this for my first job in engineering (major Gas Turbine Engine Company) 'way back then; pre-Internet. This book helped me then and even now when I have questions (although I practice bedside Medical Engineering as a physician). I still have questions about non-Medical Engineering for which I use this book.
5,LOVE THIS FAUCET,"Let me say, I shopped and shopped to look for a widespread faucet that was reasonable but was of good quality. My patience paid off. LOVE THIS FAUCET. It is by far the most substantial faucet I came across. It is honestly the item I like best in my newly remodeled bathroom. Let me also say that when my plumber installed this faucet, he said ""you got a great deal. This faucet will outlast this house"".If you can get it for about a hundred bucks, then you better get the bargain of the century."
5,Excellent Safety Glasses,"Thse are great safety glasses. When I wear them I actually forget I even have them on. Makes wearing them much easier, and keeps me safe. I've had other old school pairs that felt crappy and blurred your vision making me not want to wear them. With these I can do whatever I need without the problems.BUY THEM! and save your eyes!"
5,Lightweight and comfortable,"These are very nice, especially for the price. Lightweight, comfortable, well-designed, overall a great pair of safety glasses."
4,Good inexpensive protection,Good lightweight and cheap eye protection. They will fog occasionally but is no different than any other pair I have ever owned. I would buy the same pair if I needed to replace these.
4,Decent,These are pretty decent for what they are. They are lightweight and comfortable and I bought them to use when I am outside doing yardwork and they are just fine for that.
5,Wraparound protection that curves to protect from the top and bottom too.,"My husband worked as a carpenter for many years in a previous life so his enthusiastic ""two thumbs up"" means a lot. He liked the way they wrap around your face and curve up under your eyes so that you don't have to be as concerned about stuff flying into your eyes from around the frame. They are light weight and have good clarity. They work on my face too but I need something that will fit over my glasses as these aren't designed for those circumstances."
2,they sit wonky,"Although they don't appear bent, they sit wonky or askew on my head. And no it's not my ears. Also bought the tinted equivalent and they were fine."
2,NOT GOOD ENOUGH.,Dewalt DPG54-1C Protector Clear High Performance Lightweight Protective Safety Glasses with Wraparound FrameTHIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. I NEED SOMETHING TO PROTECT MY SENSITIVE EYES. IT DOES NOT FIT WELL FOR ME. I WILL JUST GIVE THIS TO MY HELPER. THE MSA BRANDS HAVE BETTER FIT. BUT THE SELLER IS VERY GOOD WITH THEIR SHIPPING.
4,"Perfect fit, good price, often forget I'm wearing them.","I have often forgotten I am wearing these.That is probably the biggest con, I leave my shop and then have to go back to put my glasses away. I have never had this problem before...For the price I cannot get over the quality, I have dropped them on more than one occasion and had no scratching issues. I did have them on top of my head and scratched them because I banged my head (this again a testament that I forgot I had them on). The lenses are very clear especially for plastic. On occasion they will steam up but that is more due to my dust mask. I have a rather large head (too bad it's empty) but they fit very nicely. I would compare their build quality to to a decent pair of sunglasses, not $100.00 pair but some in the $30.00-$50.00 range."
4,Very comfortable and stylish for a great price,"I put these on to show my wife and she thought I should get them in a prescription so I can wear them all the time. They look and feel great. I wore them for a couple hours around the house and for some small shop stuff. They stick to your head and don't move very much at all.A couple things though that prevent it from being 5-star. They seem very easy to smudge, so be careful to keep your hands and wrists away from them. They wiped pretty clean with a lens cloth. Second, you do need to look at something directly to avoid lensing. Meaning, things tend to distort slightly at the edges. Finally, these won't fit over glasses. I saw a couple posts where they claim to fit over glasses, but I don't see how that's possible without jeopardizing safety.Quality product and 2 for $10 shipped was a bargain."
4,"These glasses are cheap (In a good way), and work well.","I got my pair in perfect condition with no scratches on it, and the clear plastic is ridiculously easy to see through. They fit my head perfectly, and are very comfortable. Unfortunately, I'm power sanding (I bought these to keep the dust from shooting straight into my eyes), and so I'm also wearing a protective mask to prevent me from breathing all the bad stuff in. This means when I breathe out, my breath goes straight out of the top of the mask at the bridge of my nose, which fogs these glasses up immediately. Every time I breathe out, my field of vision gets blocked. I would like to contribute this to my mask being too full of dust from the air for my breath to escape how it's designed to, but I'm not sure. They appear to be of good quality, and they definitely are worth the price."
5,comfortable,These are crystal clear and so light and comfortable that I sometimes forget I am wearing them. I am an average sized woman but tend to need glasses for faces that are on the wider size of average (not huge though!). I think these would be too small for big guys.
2,"Barely fit, and get scratched way too easily for how much I paid for them",...and the they bend way WAY too easily. Last time I purchase these again. And they hardly cover your face. Ridiculous.
2,Comfortable but not functional for shop work,I bought these glasses for my husband to use in the factory he works at to protect his eyes. While they are comfortable to wear he found that he kept having to wipe the lenses off and eventually just took them off because they were getting foggy from his breathing normally. There is no reason for that to happen. The shop stays at about 60 degrees in the winter so the normal breathing action should not have caused this. Having to find different glasses for safety since these became more of a hazard in real life setting.
4,"Lightweight, clean; Yet Disposable Quality","These were very inexpensive glasses so one should not have high expectations. Therefore they are pretty flimsy and remind me of something that would be disposable. I am wondering if they would last more than one day of wearing them in a construction area? I am still happy with the purchase, and I got what I paid for."
4,Decent pair of safety glasses,"I ordered these when I started my new car rebuild project; I knew I'd be grinding and painting and I didn't want to do it unprotected. Used them on a few small projects so far and no real complaints.These goggles fit pretty comfortably and they feel solid. They do seem to get cloudy while I'm working, about every 15-20 minutes I have to take a break to wipe the goggles down; me exhaling constantly probably doesn't help. I also use a respirator, this one:3M R6211 Low-Maintenance Half-Mask Organic Vapor, P95 Respirator Assembly, Medium- the respirator and goggle combination fits fine, no interference.Based on the price, there is really no reason not to use some kind of eye protection if you think you might need it. These are a great choice."
5,Great Product,"Really love it! The quality es very good, strong item. Also never get tarnish. I really recommend the item. Also the vendor ship very fast, I leave in offshore and the product arrive 3 days after I made the purchased."
4,"More ""wrap around"" please.",The only complaint I have with these otherwise durable and scratch-resistant glasses is the wraparound quality. I still have material getting into my eyes. Perhaps it's just my head shape.
2,Inaccurate Description,The item is advertised as one piece but is actually 2 pieces. And it doesn't actually fit nicely onto the rear passenger side floor of my 2001 RX300 as advertised. The material looks durable though.
3,not into it,"I ordered this dvd because my 2 year old granddaughter loves wonderpets. However, I think it is kind of wierd. The animation is okay and the episodes are short enough that we can watch one or 2 and talk about them, but I wouldn't really recommend this series as anything that's of much educational value."
3,glass tiger cd,"A list of songs should have been on the description. There were songs I wish were on the cd, I probably would have chosen a different cd"
4,Glass Tiger,Another great CD from the 80's..so hard to lsiten to some music these days..80's music was awesome and I love the song Someday from this CD..all of them are good..A msut get CD
5,Milwaukee be afraid!,"This thing is bad ass! It'll cut threw anything like butta. The power is enormous. I own many sawzalls, and let me tell you, this thing will out cut any of them. I believe this beast will beat anything on the market. With regards to the previous posters remarks about a loose blade and the ""vertical plane"". That's nonsense! It's designed to keep the blade from snapping due to the overwhelming power of this machine. You see, the blade only flexes on the flat part, moving back and forth. So, it was designed with about a half inch of play to move up and down. This prevent it from snapping when or if the blade gets caught. Capeesh? In fact, check out any other sawzall and wiggle the blade. You'll notice anywhere between a quarter to a half inch of play depending on the power of the saw. The mean green machine will not be beat!!"
3,Powerful but heavy.,"I like the power on this saw, but after longer use it does get heavy. Sometimes when installing the blade, you have to plug in and start it to get the blade attachment nob to extend out far enough to get access. Also, the blade seems loose after installing properly but will not fall off. It's just the way it is it seems. After 1+ year now, the power cord seems like it may break shortly due to the way it is bent when stored in the case. If it ever dies, I'll probably buy the milwaulkee. A friend has it and it just feels more comfortable. However, price wise this is a good saw. 3 stars only for the issues encountered."
2,The Splendor of the Royal Court fizzles,The quality of the film was very poor. The acting wooden and largely unemotional. I have seen high school plays better written and acted than this.
4,"Peeeeanut, Peanut Butter...and Jelly!","I love that peanut butter song. I bought the album just for that. It really gets me through and day, and really annoys all my co-workers."
3,Good for Kids under 7 only!,"Alright, it is Barney and everyone hates him, but for little kids this is the CD that will keep their little butts busy while you get some peace and, well, not quiet, but at least peace."
5,Great!!,"I got this for my sister for her birthday and I was a little worried that it wouldn't arrive in time for her party, but she got it so fast and it was in perfect condition. I was very pleased!"
1,dont waste your time on barney,"This is practily brain candy for your kids, because barney isn't a good role model. He teaches stuff like 123's and abc's, but he sounds dumb,and my 2 year old sis thinks he's a bad, evil guy with his deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep voice. This is Dumb.P.S instead of barney, get seasame street. My brother is 19 and he thinks Elmo is Da Bomb! ( I do too) and seasame street actully teaches something."
5,Grandma of three,This is the perfect Barney CD. Has all the kids favorite songs. I have 3 grandchindren and this CD has to be in every car!!! Even calms the 3 month old. There is something special about Barney. The 3 year old loves singing along. Great purchase!
3,Not as good as I expected,"I agree with some other reviewers that the accessory handle is junk. While in use, it slid off the neck and chewed up the bottom of the plastic chuck. The chuck still works smoothly, but has a gnarly ragged edge on the bottom now. Why they cheapened up the handle so much is beyond me. Fortunately, the accessory handle from my old Bosch 18V fits great, other handle is now the trash. Beyond my gripe with the handle, the drill has all the torque you could want, a nice long cord and a really smooth variable-speed trigger."
4,Minimalist Techno Classic,This is a great offering of earlier techno from Robert Hood who was formerly part of the Underground Resistance Crew with Jeff Mills. The style here is somewhat similar to the Mills material with the minimalist beats creating that industrial techno feel. A great sampling of the growth of Techno for the early 90s. Seek out his later material (the Night World) for a look into his jazzier progression.
5,Awesome!!,"This is an outstanding book! I must admit though, in some parts I got royally freaked out. I made myself not read it at night. But it is an utterally awesome book and I hope everyone whos anyone reads it!"
5,Fast shipping,The seller was fast a shipping and my kids loved the book it took only a 2 days for them to read and they gave it to other friends to read.
4,Delightful read,"Although repetitive at times and the culprit was obvious, this book gives CSI television serious competition despite 19th century forensics."
5,Chilling,"The Adding Machine by Elmer Rice is regard by many as the first play to bring German expressionism to the American theatre. The story follows the emotional struggle of the characters rather than the plot (in fact most of the major events of the play occur off stage) until he wrote The Adding Machine Rice was a master of the melodrama, but The Adding Machine's distinctively modern feel and disturbing message set it apart from his other plays. It includes a erie dinner scene where six identical couples speak a hyper active version of small talk. this play exposes common place vulgarities and everyday injustice."
5,"Great music, great performances","Herreweghe brings aspiration and joy to these ""Lutheran"" masses, rather than dour piety. They are musically moving even to a non-religious listener. These are first-rate performances. Be careful, however, if you have been buying Bach disks for many years; this box of 4 CDs includes re-releases of recordings as old as 1990. Thus you may find, as I did, that you are buying performances you already own, with different cover art."
2,Does Not Hold a Charge for Long,"The battery works, but doesn't hold a charge for much more than an hour of on and off use. Would buy a different product next time."
4,Pod 9.6 volt battery (2 ea),The first shipment was lost by UPS and upon contacting the Battery Geeks the Battery Geeks quickly sent replacements without any cost to me and the product has performed satisfactorily up to now.Amm
1,very fragile,"I have a 9.6v flashlight, with these batteries, if you drop it at all or impact it in any way the plastic explodes, once craked it just falls apart"
2,Recharging,"It's best to have 2 batteries, one for use and one for the charger. This way one is ready to go whenever your devise battery has run out of power. Only problem with this idea is the cost is almost the same as a complete drill kit that includes 2 batteries. Makes you think about the price of batteries. I see many kits for $ and the replacement batteries for them run $ each. They must be giving away the drill and rechargers knowing the battery sales will make up. Happy drilling."
1,Not worth the money.,"When I puchased my Makita 9.6V Drill/Driver, it came with 2 of these 9.6V batteries; after 2 years, they stopped taking a charge and I've looked around to replace them. I found the price for these replacement battery packs to be ridiculous... I found a new 14.4V drill/driver (different brand) with 2 battery packs and charger for only twenty dollars more than the cost of 1 of these Makita replacement batteries. So I would throw out your old Makita and shop for a new model with 2 batteries... it just makes no sense to pay these prices for replacement batteries. Also, since these Ni-Cad batteries have probably been sitting in a warehouse for years without a charge, you can bet they will have a shortened life."
3,makita battery,"Amazon was great, they shipped quickly and did everything they promised. However, I think the battery has been sitting on a shelf somewhere in a wharehouse and it does not charge as well as the original one. Someone else said the simliar thing in their review, but I proceeded to buy hoping it was an isloated insident. I now wish I follwed the others recommendtion of buying a new modern drill with much better power."
1,dud,I received the correct battery however it was defective and would not charge. I have returned the battery and am waiting for a good replacement. So far customer service has been okay!
4,better than expected,"I received a Makita label battery, not necessarily what I was expecting. Most of the replacement products available were ""no-name"", and I was concerned that the specs and performance would not match the original. This battery works perfectly with the original charger and has plenty of power. Nice to have my drill gun back to peak performance."
5,first rice cooker,"I have always been the make it yourself on the stove type of girl. So when my current co worker told me about his rice cooker i was skeptical, but curiosity got the best of me after a couple of days of research i decided on this one. After is arrived I had to try it so got everything ready and started it off. I had to leave my house for a few hours so I left it on. When I came back the rice was finished and wonderfull the instructions were great. Now i can do a lot more than look over the rice I am extremly happy with my Rice cooker even made rice pudding the first day :)"
3,rice cooker,"Zojirushi NHS-18 10-Cup Rice Cooker/Steamer & WarmerI say its ok. It makes too many rules to make rice and to me the rice is watery. You can't put the rice in the rice maker pot and drain the rice before turning the rice maker on. you have to use their measure cup, use a separate bowl, use the measure inside the pot for water amount, the glass lid is heavy, slippery and hard to clean. I expected more simple instructions and better steamed rice."
1,The worst rice cooker that I have ever had!,This is the third nonstick rice cooker that I have had. It is only 4 months and the pot is very discolored already. I have used it 8-9 times. This was more expensive than the Aroma that I had which lasted 5 years. I thought I was getting a better quality rice cooker with the Zojirushi and that it would last longer. Not true!
2,Sticky rice - sticky counter,"I bought a new rice cooker because I wanted one that would not burn the bottom layer if kept in keep warm for an hour or two. What I got was a rice cooker that still made that crispy bottom layer and it shows up at the end of cooking, not even in warm, and a very messy counter top. This rice cooker splashes and pops hot rice liquid at least 6 inches around the unit. Not very safe with little kids around and not fun to clean up. It does make good rice though."
1,Overrated,"This rice cooker is completely overrated. I searched far and wide for a good rice steamer after my last one died, and I kept coming across rave reviews of the Zojirushi brand of rice cookers. So I bought one, and I must say I am dissappointed. It's not that it doesn't work, it works adequately, just like my last rice cooker. But for the price I payed for this cooker, I expected to be wowed. My last rice cooker (which was a common name-brand) cost a third the amount of this one, and worked just as well."
5,Easy to use Rice cooker,"I bought this to replace an older, smaller Salton model that worked well, but did not have replacement parts available when the silicone insert in the steam opening was lost. I wanted something to cook rice easily and larger quantities than the old one. Despite some negative reviews, this seemed to be the best choice for the price. I am not disappointed. I just add a little more liquid when cooking brown or a wild rice mixture we cook very often. No problems and the rice is just right. I'd recommend it without reservations. I also like the separate steaming basket included. A great addition!!"
2,A REAL SPITTER...,"First let me say that I really LOVE Zojirushi products. I have the bread maker, coffepot & rice cooker ( which I am replacing because it is old & tired 8 yrs.). That said I am sad to give this a 2 star rating. I read all the reviews and followed all the advice..rinsing, soaking etc. etc. I still had a big mess on my counter. The rice was also a bit soggy for my taste. I cook long grain brown & wild rice. I am not a novice to rice cooking I have used the more expensive NRC Zojirushi for years...thought I would save some money & try this one. I sent this one back & ordered the more expense one. It is a very well made cooker and maybe does great with regular white rice."
3,Rice gets wet and mushy when left in 'warm' mode,"PROS- Inexpensive- Rice is cooked nicely- Easy to clean- Works as steamerCONS- Rice gets wet and mushy when left in 'warm' mode (in Tagalog, 'malata')First, when rice is cooked (washed properly and with the right amount of water), it's cooked perfectly. Now, after cooking, it get's to warm mode so the rice is still warm. If you cooked the rice for dinner, and leave it in warm mode overnight, the rice in the side is wet, it's like water is spilled on it. The middle is fine though.I'm returning this and will buy a different model.Not recommended if you'll leave the rice in warm mode overnight."
1,Unsuitable for Brown Rice,"I spent several hours searching & researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice ""measurements"" which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the ""keep warm"" function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet & mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice!"
2,OK rice cooker,"It makes good white rice but when you keep it on to warm, it makes the bottom soggy that it will spoil the rice after couple of days. I read all other reviews about washing the rice carefully but even after multiple careful washing, it would still make the bottom soggy when left to warm. I should have coughed up the extra money and bought a Tiger rice cooker."
2,Cold War Relic,"I saw this film in college during the sixties. Originally intended as a BBC documentary about how the British civil defense procedures would greatly reduce atomic war casualties, the film maker was so shocked by the inadequacy of the system that he produced this movie to show just how horrifying such a war would be. The result is one of the most powerful antiwar statements ever."
2,A BIG ORCHESTRA JAZZ LOVER,"This DVD appears to have been compiled from very old tapes or films. No effort was made to enhance the video or the audio; as a result, the final product has marginal quality. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone.J Dalton"
3,It's not bad...,"Nice shirt, awesome patch on the front, very warm and comfy, but not the greatest workmanship. I've used mine maybe a dozen times and the edge of the front pocket is coming apart. Not a big deal that a few minutes with needle and thread can't fix, but you'd think that, for the price, it'd outlast your normal walmart sweatshirt. I've not worn it very hard, either. Mostly I've worn it at work (in an office) whenever the AC was turned up too high. I've never carried anything in the front pocket, either."
4,Large and durable.,This was much larger than I expected but still useful. Very durable. It would be best for carrying cleaning supplies around the house.
3,to long,I love these caddya i use them for my cleaning company buy it took sooooo long to get it near 3 weeks.
4,Welcome to Sarajevo,"Maybe I am getting old or something but I think soundtracks are getting better. This one has a wonderful mix of diverse tracks. They flow nicely from one to the next. The movie was decent, the soundtrack much better. The final track is haunting. It took a while but I finally got a Bosnian to tell me what it was about. No I am not going to tell you... but I am glad I found out.enjoy."
1,READ BEFORE PURCHASING,"Be forewarned: this edition is not the full shilling. At a mere 161 pages, it is not even a third of the actual novel. Nowhere does it indicate this to be the case, so if you purchase it without looking at the page count in the product description notes, you might be fooled, since all the customer reviews here are actually for other (complete) editions. I just returned it and ordered the Penguin Classics (Everyman's Library also has a fine but more expensive edition).Because all reviews for various editions seem to be lumped together on a single page, I'd like to clarify as to exactly which edition I'm warning people away from:Product DetailsPaperback: 162 pagesPublisher: World Library Classics (August 22, 2009)Language: EnglishISBN-10: 1557427739ISBN-13: 978-1557427731Product Dimensions: 8.8 x 5.9 x 0.5 inches"
1,"The Best Translation: search ""Oblomov + Stephen Pearl""","This new translation of Oblomov by Stephen Pearl brings the work to life as never before. Don't buy the old Penguin translation or the new Schwartz translation, unless you want to get bogged down in stale or scholarly English. This translation is fresh and vivid and (the experts say) accurate. It won the 2008 Prize for Best Translation into English from the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages.In the Pearl translation, you will experience the wry humor of Goncharov. You will encounter Goncharov's amazingly drawn characters as if they were real people: the pathologically lethargic but lovable Oblomov; Zakhar, his loyal servant and Sancho Panza; Stolz, his super-organized, energetic, yet affectionate German friend; and the poignantly sweet Olga.Don't miss the chance to devour this Russian classic in fresh, crunchy English. It's a great read!Oblomov"
1,Oblomov,"I received my copy of ""Oblomov""(Classic Reprint) and was disgusted to find that this ""translation"" is actually a grossly abridged version of the work. It was NOT presented as such online and I was only alerted to this fact when I compared the size to a copy of a recently translated version of ""Oblomov"" that had many more words. Further research revealed the truth of the matter.Buyer beware!"
2,Caution: May be abridged,"Be careful if you're ordering this for a class or a formal setting. I ordered the one published by ""CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (December 20, 2012)."" Sat down to start reading it for my Russian literature class and realized my copy was a lot smaller than my professor's. This version is heavily abridged!! Make sure the copy you're ordering is closer to 500 pages than 200. I had to go to the public library to get a copy.If you're just curious about the basic plot of the book, the abridged version may be appropriate for you.I'm about 200 pages into the David Magarshack translation (Penguin edition published Sept. 2005), and I love the novel so far. It would get a great review if I had ordered that copy originally."
1,Verify anything you read in this book from another source.,"After the mistakes in the first one, do not trust anything. Verify address and location information. The first book was not edited properly or self-published without being edited. I would be careful with the facts in this one too."
1,"Read "" Windy City Ghosts "" instead","This second book is even worse than the first, after her first book-which she ends with a cheap booze joke that mocks the whole field of Parapsychology-Mrs Bielski is contacted by many people in the Chicago area who describe their paranormal experiences to her, only to have them whitewashed as folklore or myth. Mrs Bielski's whole problem is, her mind is so filled with materialistic philosophy she can't even understand human feeling when she sees it. Resurrection Mary is far more real than this phony. If you want your money worth of this book, take it with you to the toilet."
5,Shape UK,"This cd is worth buying, love the dance high energy music.Shape UK used to be really hot! Buy this one!"
3,Excellent Novels.....but order wasn't what expected...,"Both books, The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons were both excellent reads. Will definitely reread over and over again. When i went to order, i thought this was the regular fully illustrated versions of the books. When i recieved the books, however, i found that weren't that. The only part that was illustrated was the inside covers of both books. But again....both wonderful books in a nice set."
5,Favorite,An all time favorite for any child. Fun and always changing story. My children had me buy it for the Grandchild.
5,Original Equipment Replacement Micron Cartridge,"An inexpensive (when purchased here @ Amazon, at least) replacement cartridge, identical to the one that came with my H.O.T. Magnum aquarium filter, which lasted over ten years.Great for occasional 'water polishing', but not suitable for longterm, continuous aquarium filtration, as its ultra fine particle filtration capacity means that it soon clogs with debris (2-3 days)and greatly reduces the filter's flow. It then requires an overnight soaking in a bleach and water solution, followed by a second soak in a dechlorinator solution, before being used again.Be sure to install this filter cartridge with the blue, 'Right Size' foam filter sleeve over it, to help pre-filter larger particles that would contribute to the micron cartridge becoming clogged even sooner than usual."
1,woodworker,Be careful before you buy the Jet Air Filtration System. If you have new florescent lights sometimes the remote switches that come with the Jet system are not compatible. Call jet customer service before you purchase. Our system has been troublesome with the units turning on by themselves when the lights are on and then not switching properly. If you work with the lights off no problem.
1,AFS-1000 Vs AFS-1000B,"Just in case anyone is still confused... I haven't placed my order yet, as I am still a bit confused too.But, according to JET, the AFS-1000 has a maximum air flow of 650 CFM. The AFS-1000B, its replacement model, has a maximum air flow of 1044 CFM, a significant difference.I'd like to know which model Amazon.com is actually selling at $219.99. My guess is that it's the discontinued AFS-1000, as the specifications would indicate.Pete"
2,it's okay,"I have to admit.Before I actually received this in the mail, I didn't really know what I was buying.The pictures look like an old computer from the movie WarGames.Well, sadly, let's just say that I won't be playing Global Thermonuclear War anytime soon..."
4,"Quiet & effective, good value. But, very poor JET QA from factory...","I purchased this unit for home use, based on reviews and recommendations from other users. It's a great value and I believe it works as effectively or better than the JDS I use at my shop. I am disappointed in the packaging, which appeared to be in decent shape upon receipt but the unit was dinged on one corner (easily corrected.) Additionally, the unit had a couple of irritating QA issues: every bolt, inside and out of the unit was either hand-tight or worked itself out completely during shipping. Lastly, the unit's IR receiver was cold-soldered on the PCB...had to remove the assembly and reflow the joints before it worked properly.Four star review because, after all the assembly issues were resolved, the unit is exactly what I'd hoped it would be: a quiet, effective, high-volume, high-feature air scrubber at a competitive price."
2,It vibrates,"I just purchased the new B model and the fan in it stinks. It may pump out a lot of air, but it vibrates. I mounted it to my basement ceiling and I could feel it vibrate in my living room floor above it. I exchanged it for another one and it did the same thing so I returned it.I've seen an older model run and it didn't have this problem.I just bought a JDS 750-ER and it is much smoother and quieter. I think the overall build quality is a little better and it has a third rear filter."
2,Out of Balance fan,"I read a lot of mixed reveiws on the Delta regarding the condition of the unit due to poor packaging and issues with vibration, so I went with the Jet. I recieved it yesterday and found it in good condition even though the box was pretty beat up from the delivery service. My relief over the condition quickly switched to frustration when I plugged it in and saw the squirrel cage had a severe alignment issue and the unit had a bad vibration. I took it apart and adjusted the balance clips attached to the squirrel cage and now it runs fine. I will surely forget the annoyance of having to balance a brand new tool over time, but I am not impressed with the quality assurance of this Taiwan assembled unit. No comments on how it filters dust, since I have not gotten that far yet."
4,"Works great, nice features","We bought this in 2008 so next month will be four years of using it. It has always done a good job of cleaning the air. I couldn't decide on four or five stars for this, so I went with four based on just a couple of negative items. The filters are rather expensive. They do have washable ones, and it looks like it may be included with the unit now. When I bought mine it was an extra cost. The charcoal filters are good for filtering vapors, but again, they are expensive. The unit is very heavy so mounting it on the ceiling takes some work (on the other hand, I wouldn't want it to be cheaply made, I get the compromise there). It is rather noisy on high, and overall while it moves a decent amount of air I've seen better (but they also cost more).So overall it's a good unit worth the price you pay. There are others that move more air, but cost more. The timer feature is great so you let it finish cleaning out the shop air so it's clean the next day."
4,It had a bumpin the road.,"I opened up the box and took out the shipping stops. I plugged it in it vibrated so bad it almost walked off the work bench. Turned out that it had been damaged in shipping, returned to the factory and re-shipped to me without being checked over. I was able to find a local service center and with a little help from them I re-trued the squirrel cage which was running eccentric on the motor shaft. Now it is hanging in my shop and doing a great job of collecting sawdust. Just don't set the timer and shut it off either manually or with the remote. When the original time elapses it will turn itself back on and run until you figure it out and go shut it off again. Let the timer run out and all will be well."
4,Jet dust collection unit,My unit arrived today after only 4 days in transit. I'm very pleased with this.The box looked fine but I experienced the same damage to the unit that many people have complained about. One of the corners was bent in but I pounded it back out satisfactorily.The ceiling mounting went fine and the mounting options were nice to have.The remote works great and the options are very nice.I can't believe Jet would ship a product that has nearly 1/4 inch wobble in the fan cage however. Now I feel I need to take the unit back down from my ceiling mount and try to straighten this out. This a two person job because of the weight. Come on JET!The suction seems great and is fairly quiet. I'll put it to the test this weekend.Would have given 5 starts if not for the packaging damage and the fan wobble.
5,Works wonders in the shop - solves 'dust storm' problems!,"Wish I'd broken down and bought one sooner. This makes such a difference in your woodworking time in the shop. No more layers of dust settling all over the place, and is great for your health!"
4,Very good machine,"This is the second Jet I've owned, the first being sold for personal reasons. I had been searching again for another unit and found one here on Amazon for considerably less than my local stores. It works as advertised and reduces quite a bit of dust from the air and makes your shop a bit more dust free than without any unit at all. It does NOT get ALL of the dust, but it does remove quite a bit, making the air cleaner and also your tools and the need to wipe everything down after you've finished. Combine this with a good dust collector (I'm still shopping) and a dust mask and you'll be pleased with the lack of dust around your shop, and more importantly, your lungs!! The timer function is a set and walk away. Combine the price, no sales tax, AND free shipping (Prime Member) and this is a no brainer. Thanks Amazon!!!"
5,Jet AFS-l000/708620G Air Filtration System,"This system is everything the manufacture said it was. It is quiet, comes complete with eyebolts for ceiling mounting. It is light and compact. The timer is very useful so you don't have to worry about turning it off after you leave your shop,plus you can run it 2,4 or 8 hours and forget it. Good quality."
1,"decent unit, if you can get one to arrive in one piece.!!!","All I can tell you about this unit is this. It will most likely arrive with the fan slightly off center from getting banged around by the lovely people at Fed-Ex. I have had Amazon replace it twice for me before I decided to purchase it elsewhere, and I still got it with this Fan issue. In a nutshell, when this fan is slightly out of alligment it will make this unit vibrate like a washing machine with all the clothes on one side.... Very frustrating, and I would not purchase this unit from Amazon....."
1,Another D.O.A.,"When I was considering purchasing an air cleaner, I looked at the customer reviews on the Delta 850CFM unit, the JDS 750CFM unit, and this Jet 650CFM model. The Jet won, mostly on innovative features (variable speed, remote control & electrostatic filter). I was however, concerned about the quality of the Jet. First because of one of the Amazon customer reviewers said he received this item Dead On Arrival and second because Jet quality can be quite erratic in my experience. Well, chaulk up another D.O.A. for the boys at Jet and for the same reason as the other guy. The machine's fan will not rotate at the 2 slower speeds. When you hit high speed, it sounds like a jumbo jet. Not good. I'm not taking any chances with further quality problems so this is going back PERMANENTLY. I will get the JDS 750je model as that is always said to be a high quality unit."
3,Moves and cleans air - Exterior filter description deceptive.,"This unit has made a definite difference in my shop. The amount of dust collected on the exterior electrostatic filter is testimony enough to it's air cleaning capability. While considerable in it's sound signature, I don't find it bothersome. There is no rattling or vibrations, just a whole lot of white noise.On the negative end I would have to complain about the deceptive exterior, electrostatic filter sizing/description. The included filter is labeled as a 12x24x1 when in fact it is just a tad smaller. This until will NOT accept the standard sized 12x24x1 filters you get at your local shop. I discovered this only after buying 4 filters and trying to get one to fit. Oh, and the filter cannot be ""washed"" as mentioned in the product description. It's framed in cardboard!!I'm irked over the filter issue so I'm only giving three stars."
5,Wood working is much more pleasant,"I waffled between a duct collection system with hoses and this one. I wanted the host based system, but they are single purpose machines and a bit pricey for me as a hobbyist.I landed on the jet system because I get sinus issue with airborne saw dust and I didn't want dust circulating throughout the house. I couldn't be happier. I mounted the unit to the ceiling basement which is under my living room. In the basement, the unit is quite quiet and it really moves the air. In the room above, there is a slight hum but it's not loud.It cleans the air really well. I have been using my circular saw and hand power planer, both with a dust bags, and the airborne dust is much reduced. I can get away without a mask and there is saw dust on the horizontal surfaces away from my work. I also do karate work outs in the basement which kicked up concrete dust, but the Jet picks that up too.Definitely a good purchase and when I get a host system, I'll be dust free."
5,Glad I got it!,"I thought about getting one of these for awhile and I finally did for my 1 car garage shop. The unit is quieter than most tools in the shop and I use hearing protection anyway so I don't really hear it. I found the remote to work fine, doesn't seem unidirectional in my set up at all. The one I noticed is that the unit will come on by itself sometimes. My theory is the timer is rudimentary so if I set it for 2 hours and manually turn it off before the 2 hours is up, the timer kicks the switch after 2 hours even if it is turned off so the timer turns it on. I could have a defective unit but that's my theory. It's not a problem and I and my love the filter. I think it's a fine worthwhile purchase."
2,Terrible QC on the fan,"Another example of fine Chinese craftsmanship. The impeller on the fan was not perpendicular to the fan motor shaft; therefore, the thing vibrated like crazy due to the wobble. I ended up taking the entire assembly apart and truing the impeller myself, which took most of the vibration and excess noise out the unit. It sure seems like there should be better quality control, it makes me wonder how high the quality of the components are that I can't see. I imagine it will do an adequate job of filtering the dust in my shop though."
5,GOOD MACHINE,GOT THIS MACHINE BECAUSE MY WIFE SAID I WAS PUTTING TO MUCH DUST IN THE HOUSE. GUESS WHAT?? SHE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT ANYMORE.VERY QUIET AND I LOVE THE REMOTE. THE ONLY THING I NEEDS IS A AIR DEFLECTOR ON THE EXHAUST.
4,"OK, But...","Product is exactly what I expected and wanted. Got it at a great price (at $229 and free shipping almost $100 less than local stores).But...delivered over two months after originally ordered (got the email just before original deliver date saying ""Sorry but you gotta wait some more...""shipping box was destroyed (luckily the machine was intact - Good work Jet!)4 stars because the buying experience was less than stellar."
4,Great product---but parts were missing!,"I received the unit and it works fine, but none of the hardware was included in the box, nor was the remote control (!)---all things listed in the product manual as being part of the unit. I called Jet and they are shipping me the missing pieces.The air cleaner itself is GREAT!"
4,Jet AFS-1000,"Just received the Jet Air Filtration system today. Delivery was faster than I expected. When I unpacked the unit all parts were present. I was very pleased with the unit. It did not mention in the writeup that it was 3 speed and had an auto timer built in for 2,4 or 8 hours plus solid on. Also it was much quieter than I expected. I feel it is a great addition to my shop."
3,"Good, but needed tweaking","This filtration system does its job and has great features, but I had a major problem at installation time. Out of the box, the impeller was jammed against the fan housing, so it wouldn't spin. Rather than go through the major hassle of returning it, I decided just to fix it, even though I've probably voided my warranty by doing so. The device is extremely simple, so fixing it was pretty easy, but I had to disassemble it and straighten a bent motor mounting bracket to align the motor/impeller properly. I was pretty disappointed given the great reviews Jet stuff usually gets here. My suggestion: test it before you hang/mount it."
3,Watch out for shipping damage.,"When my Jet AFS-1000 arrived the box and the exterior of the unit were in good condition. However it appeared to have been dropped on its side with sufficient force to bend the motor mounting bracket and the mounting screws. The unit would not run at all. I disassembled things and managed to straighten the bracket and get it running. The low and high speeds work fine, but the unit rattles on the middle speed. The fan itself appears to be bent. I would have been ahead to buy it from a local supplier and paid full retail price just to avoid the hassle."
2,Remote Doesnt Work,"This product has problems in shops with fluorescent lights. They can interfere with the operation of the remote. It does not work in my shop. Unfortunately, this is a well known problem to Jet! They do not have a solution except to turn off the lights to use the remote. They should correct this problem or stop selling the item! Do not mount this anywhere near a fluorescent light fixture.11/10 Just to clarify: If the unit is mounted with the receiver withing 12"" of a flourescent bulb it will not work properly. This can be a problem in small shops. It also helps to know this in advance when planning the mounting location. Jet agrees that this is an issue."
3,"Nice product, showed up damaged...","Liking the unit which is more than capable of effectively filtering the air in my two car garage. Unfortunately I opened the unit set it aside, broke down the box it came in, the saw the unit had a big dent in the corner that was facing away from me when I removed it from the packaging. I've read other reviews that suggested the packaging was inadequate and they are 100% correct. This might be a product that is better purchased locally for a little more money."
3,Disposable filters the same size don't fit,"I bought this unit partly because I saw that I could purchase disposable filters at the local store the same size as Jet says they are 1x12x24. Well jet's filter is actually a half inch smaller in each direction as a normal filter is. In other words a standard filter of the same size doesn't fit. Not sure what I'm going to do at this point, probably will fabricate a transition frame to hold the""bigger"" standard size. Jet wants $15 for their filter and the local store wants $4 for the standard size. I take this unit to job sites to help keep the customers house cleaner."
5,It all started with Columbus,Anybody who enjoys a good pun should definitely read Richard Armour's books. You remember historical happenings despite yourself. Lots of fun.
5,What a Great Gift!,"Finally here is a book that will appeal to almost everybody. I bought 20 of these to give a gifts and so far, everyone has loved it! The writer knows two things: how to eat and how to laugh. I am so tired of reading about how I dont eat right, I dont exercise right, I am going to get cancer from practically every move I make. This book just brings back fat, carbs, andand sandwiches them (no pun intended) between good laughs andwholesome homespun stories. I am sure that it will eventually be in the top 100 best-sellers. Everyone enjoy!"
1,Truly disappointed,"I just put these strings in my Yamaha FG 7005 today and the third string snapped when I was tunning... the first string! I'm sure I know how to tune this guitar, I do it nearly everyday. Maybe these strings are not meant for my type of guitar or they were once good and now turned out to be pieces of crap. I really wished I had either my money back or a new set of strings for free - prefferably strings that don't snap before I even play them! :("
5,Renewed my guiter,"I have a Yamaha student accoutic. I was ready to chop it up and burn it in the fireplace. The strings it came with hurt my fingers and the sound was awful. I blamed it on the action of the guitar. When I went to another guitar store, looking to upgrade to a much more expensive guitar, the guy handed me these and told me to try them before giving up on my current insturment. I can not describe the difference in the feel and the SOUND that my guitar now makes. I really don't understand why ANYONE would ever buy anything else."
3,just ok,"I don't hate it, but I can't say I love it either. Definitely easier on the fingers, but the lower string tension means you really have to hold down the frets firmly and very precisely to prevent buzzing. Also the volume is a lot lower on my Yamaha acoustic. Not sure I'd buy again. Regular steels are too hard for me, so these are still better for fingerpicking."
3,not a success on my guitar,"I have tried these since I like an easy playing action. They have that, but for my guitar and taste, they were too soft-sounding and lacked volume. They are different from steel core strings, for sure. Worth a try if like a quiet tone and easy fingering."
4,"Nice tone, easy to fingerpick","These strings are a good choice for fingerpickers transitioning from nylon string to steel string guitars, or for people who are just starting to play. Silk and Steels are extremely light though, so there is some loss of volume, sustain and tone. Update: after using these strings for a month my guitar started buzzing, so I took it back to the store where I was told that the tension with Silk and Steels is so low the neck was warping. They did a truss rod adjustment to compensate, but strongly recommended that I switch to standard light weight strings (like .011-.052 gauge) as soon as possible."
4,Silk & Steel!,"I like these strings. Bass notes are brilliant. The guitar is slightly easier to play. The sounds/strings seem more distinct, louder, more powerful - more so than my previous set of strings and more so than on any guitar I've ever played.Which is not to say that these strings are the best - I couldn't judge. I was worried and hesitated at first, but now after the purchase, I have no regrets. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,"Easy to play, Great sound..","I purchased these martin silk steel strings at the beginning of August this year, they still sound great on my guitar today and easy on the fingers, playing randomly for 2 hours daily for the last 3 months.. the only thing is the 3rd g~string is starting to wear down to the steel core (fret scaring), but i will be buying a couple new sets soon as a back up, because they are not too thick putting unwanted pressure on the guitar neck...worth $ getting again.."
1,Broke when tightening,"I was trying to tune the 6th E string (the first one I replaced) to a pitch pipe, and it snapped before I reached the right note. I am not a terribly experienced guitar player, so possibly I did something wrong, but it seemed pretty straightforward. I still can't play my guitar and will look for another brand."
4,acoustic delight,Guitar came in a timely manner and well packaged. Opened the package and there was one of the beautiful guitars I have owned. Now the only negative; had to take the strings off due to the fact that three of them had bad plating and would not tune. Very trivial but mentionable. Only reason did not give 5 stars.
4,steel strings,Easy to install steel strings with a crisp sound. Is easier on my fingers than other strings I have tried. I recommend these strings.
2,Storage cube,"Vinyl very firm (too firm) and zipper very small and not of good quality. Product suits my needs of protecting and storing my 22 inch carry-on luggage and fits well. Just have to be very careful with zipping it. Thus far, zipper hasn't broken and product hasn't torn, but you need to be very careful with it to extend its longevity."
4,Chemistry Book,I ordered this book because I lost my original one. The book came as it said online...acceptable condition. I did have problems with delivery but that was on behalf of the postal office.
3,C'est d'accord - mais c'est ne pas du flaubert,"In one of Woody Allen's short stories, a magician develops a box which any book placed into can be entered by a person sitting on the box. Woody's first choice is Madame Bovary, as his desire to meet the eponymous tragic heroine is so strong. Renoir, a magician of another sort who's made some of the most enchanting movies of all time, is slightly less successful. As a film in it's own right, it's OK, but as an adaptation of Flaubert's novel it leaves a lot to be desired. It's hard to blame Renoir, either for being attracted to the text, or failing to bring it to the screen succesfully, as the sheer poetry of the text is almost impossible to replicate, and casting Emma is an impossible task. Since Renoir, Minnelli and Chabrol have made simaler failures - maybe it's time to leave Emma to Flaubert's readers dreams."
2,very nice colored photos,It should be noted that this book comes without instruction. You do get a few pretty pictures . I did not enjoy the feverish prose of the author.
3,Definitely a Challenge,I made this quilt a few years ago and boy was it a challenge. First off there are no directions in the book. No patterns. There is just a line drawing of the blocks. Having computer access is a must to make this quilt as there are plenty of sites with instructions and tips to simplify the process.I think if one is addicted to making these small blocks a better book would beSylvia's Bridal Sampler from Elm Creek Quilts: The True Story Behind the Quilt - 140 Traditional Blocksby Jennifer Chiaverini. Like the Dear Jane blocks these are also challenging but at least you have excellent instructions and patterns in Jennifer's book.
4,"WE'RE CALLED ""JANIACS"" FOR A REASON","Very excited to receive my Dear Jane book however, there are no measurements or instructions for any of the patterns. I must measure each block & study it for the best way to assemle it. I can hardly wait to get started. It is my opinion this book is for advanced quilters looking for a challenge."
3,The clic-change system is NOT compatable with the Bosch PS20,"Amazon promotes the Bosch PS20 and this clic-change kit as going together. So I bought both. I unwrapped both packages today and what do you know, the PS20 is not able to accommodate the clic change system. I phoned Bosch to make sure.So now it is going back. A bit annoyed at Amazon since people have been complaining about this for at least three years. I guess the ""frequently purchased together"" is not really a recommendation, just the fact that many people have made this mistake, and continue to do so. Hopefully Amazon will change this....Jill"
3,He seems to like it but...,"I bought this is as a gift and he seems to like it, but to me the bits seem to fall out too easily. Not bad for an inside the house use."
5,Small But Good,The Clic-Change is very quick and easy. It could be better if it included more drill bits but it is very effective.
4,accessorize,"While the quick, one-handed change is nice, it's still a bit long to handle with a drill that has its weight in the back.Also, I have yet to find any accessories to complement the set-up, such as a countersink. I hope Bosch keeps putting in their R&D time to give us what we need (and want)."
3,Bosch CC2130 Clic-Change 27-Piece Drilling and Driving Set with Clic-Change Chuck,The click-change chuck has a slight wobble. I purchased this as a gift for my son along with Bosch CLPK23-180 18V 2-Tool Lithium Ion Combo Kit. We tried it out at his house and when I inserted the click change chuck into the drill we noticed a slight wobble. The wobble is not in the drill driver chuck. This may not be a problem for most jobs because the wobble is very slight and this why I have to give it a 3 star review.
5,Perfect for the beginner,"This is the best drill bit set for the beginner: I recently bought a Panasonic EY6432GQKW 15.6-Volt NiMH 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill on Amazon. Great drill by the way. I next needed a good drill bit set to work with.This has 5 drill bits that work really well - used it to drill holes in my kitchen cabinets to child proof them. The clic-change chick is AWESOME: once you attach it to the Panasonic drill, you never need to tighten or loosen any other parts at all: changing from a drill bit to a screw driverbit takes seconds - just pull forward and remove, then push the new bit back in to attach.Makes any job with a drill simple.The screwdriver bits are magnetic and work well with a range of screw heads.Overall a great buy for the price.Nice compact carrying box too."
5,great add on for the drill,Great add on to the Bosch drill I purchased. Shipped on time. Thank you for the great service.
4,Mostly Good,"Upon receiving this set I was surprised that it was made in China. I had gotten used to buying quality Bosch products made elsewhere. In any case, all of the parts work well with my Bosch 18v tools. However, the drill bits are totally useless for precision work and I just tossed them in the trash and replaced them with bits that are straight and bore a hole to the size expected. The case is a handy item and I carry it around in the canvas bag that came with my impact driver and drill. This is not a bad set for the price."
3,Amazon - Bosch Clic-Change 27 Piece Drilling and Driving Set,"I bought the Bosch Clic-Change 27 Piece Drilling and Driving Set the same time as the 12-Volt cordless impact driver and drill combo set. Like all Bosch products they are well made. However, I am a little disappointed that the Clic-Change Chuck (the real reason for this purchase) will not fit either the driver or the drill."
2,Just a little too goofy...,"This book is not all that great unless you have the mentality of a 12 year old... All I can say is I purchased the book and to my dismay, I had about two giggles out of it... I do think, however, that it would make a good gag gift..."
4,Uncompromising,"This album comes as a bit of a surprise following the batch of songs on JE's ""Workmanship"" EP. It's darker, for one thing. It seems to me like an experimental album Ronnie Martin wanted to make for his own purposes, with little regard for commercial considerations. Advances in his trademark sound are evident everywhere, and while it's fascinating to listen to, I could do with a little more ear candy here and there (as if JE hasn't provided enough already on past albums, I know). Many albums that took time to grow on me became my favorites in the past, and I suspect this might just be one of those."
4,Love... conquer me again,"Just when I thought I had had enough of Joy Electric and the blips and bloops, Ronnie Martin throws me a curve. ""The Ministry of Archers"" is definately his best work in years. I'd say since ""White Songbook"". I found ""Hello Manequin"" to be a bit dissapointing and his side project Shepherd was less than stellar. I almost gave up hope. Not that this album sounds a heck of alot different, but it is darker as mentioned previously. I think it is a much needed darker. Too much sunshine makes synth music unbearable for me. The songs are short and to the point and leave you wanting more... until you hit track 10. This is the only misstep of the album. I am glad it is the last song as you won't mind turning off at this point. So 9 out 10 is quite good in my book."
5,Flooring Staple 1-1/2 inch,"These are an excellent value, as good as the more expensive brand names. Used them installing 3/4 inch solid Brazilian cherry hardwood flooring, it worked really well despite the hardness of the wood. No issues."
3,What a disappointment!,"This book was totally the opposite of what I was expecting - namely, practical down-to-earth steps in preparing a magazine article. Instead, it was filled with samples that could be called ""motivational"" but not the practical tips I seeking. I found the ""Writer's Digest Handbook of Magazine Article Writing"" by Jean Frederette to be much more of the nuts and bolts that I was looking for. Perhaps a more experienced writer would appreciate the powerful examples in this book; however, as a novice I need to know more tecnique than theory. My book will be shoved to the back of the bookcase for now."
3,Somewhat out of date,"This book was published in 1991 and does not appear to be up-to-date, both in the information imparted and the style, etc. However, it concentrates much more on the mechanics of writing than on the selling of the articles and I think it has a lot of good things to say in this area. If you want help writing, I recommend it, but if you want help submitting and selling I recommend ""Writing and Selling Articles for Profit"" by L. Perry Wilbur."
5,Exceptionally insightful,"I teach magazine journalism at the college level, and I find Peter Jacobi's book to be the best available for helping students understand the important aspects of this often challenging form of expression. Jacobi offers insightful and interesting examples, he connects with readers in an engaging way, and he walks readers through the process from idea to final polish. I have considered nearly every magazine-writing book out there and I recommend this one very highly."
3,A Collections Of Articles. That's It. Nothing Else.,"The title should have been ""How Your Articles Should Look"" The book is a good read... It will get the ""creative"" juices flowing. Through article examples, the book shows you different methods on how your articles should look. If you're searching for a book that goes into the mechanics of article writing, this book is not it."
5,excellent book,This book as been a great study. I have learned much from it. The questions are clear and easy to follow. Makes a good group or as a single study. It has been very satisfying. Beth Moore does an excellent job of keeping your attention.
4,Great,Beth Moore is better at her in bible studies even more than her vidios. She includes personal application that keeps your interest up to finish the study.
4,Waiting for the updated one,"This Bible Study on David was written in 1996. I'm doing it right now. It has a lot of good points but comparing to Beth Moore's more recent ones, I found some of the questions in this study's are too general and there are so many of think of a time you did... type of questions.I'm looking forward to the updated version of A Heart Like His."
4,A Heart Like His; Member Book,"A Heart Like His: Member BookThis is a great study book on the story of David by Beth Moore. It seems like a lot of work, but the rewards are great. This study is great for all ages and it doesn't matter if your a ""new"" Christian or a very seasoned one. My girlfriend described the study as a ""good book you can't put down""."
5,You want Perfectly Cooked Rice? Ya Got It!,"It may take a little longer, but the result is worth it! My husband purchased this for me as a gift, and I've been using it from 2-5 times a week without any problems whatsoever. And the rice? It comes out restaurant quality EVERY time. I had purchased a cheaper Salton model before, and the heating element was dead within a month. What a waste.I've tried almost all of the included recipes and have not been disappointed yet. (I haven't bothered with the porridge though - so I can't say whether or not that setting works) Add anything you want to the rice before cooking. Jambalaya made easy.I would highly recommend this item to anyone who enjoys rice dishes."
3,For the $ everything should work!,"This is a very nice rice maker - that makes rice extraordinarily well. I bought it because of the reviews and because I own a Jojirushi breast maker that makes wonderful loaves of bread. The appearance of the rice cooker is great, and the settings and controls very simple and intuitive. However, the porridge cycle on my machine does NOT work correctly - for the price everything on this rice maker should work correctly the first time without having to hassle returns or warranty repairs. So, overall a nice rice cooker, but with poor quality control."
1,Worst Rice Cooker,We make rice everyday and this is probably the worst rice cooker we've owned in our family.One feature among rice cookers is the ability to keep rice warm and moist for a period of time.There's something about the seal that does not keep the rice moist (Japanese Rice). The rice tends to quickly dry after it is cooked. We've had it serviced but to no avail.Our Friends who have this model have encountered the same problems.
5,Best pair of shoes I've ever owned!,"I was hesitant to purchase shoes online, but the reviews on these were so great (as was the price)that I gave it a go. I was desperate for a quality pair of running shoes after my 5-yr-old Sketchers gave me some sore feet and blisters to write home about after a 6 mile stint on the treadmill. When I first tried them on, I actually thought for a moment they were too small/tight, but quickly realized that is what shoes that are made for your feet feel like! They hug and support the top and arch of the foot perfectly, the heel, ankle area never causes uncomfortable friction and have yet to get the numb toe feeling I used to get after wearing tennies for any length of time. I am one of those people that remove their shoes at every opportunity, but not so much with these 'cause I forget they are even on. (Yes, they are that comfortable.)"
1,Disappointing Travel Show,"I purchased this DVD hoping to see highlights of Greenland and Iceland, but the movie comes off looking like a bad music video (circa 1990) with ultra-stylized, grainy scenes with flashy effects and jerky camera movements. When I played the DVD it annouced it was Rated ""G,"" but that must have meant ""gross"" due to the explicit scenes of a man hunting reindeer, seeing it stumble to the ice, and seeing the man slit its throat and disembowling it. Whereas I know this may be typical life in Greenland, it didn't have to be shown in such disturbing detail. The bulk of the movie simply depicts Wright prancing around in the snow. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not normal,"My husband is asian and between him and all of his family, I have been around MANY rice cookers - all different brands. And I just want to say that NONE of them have EVER spit water on the counter or got the counter wet, or even moist. It is an obvious flaw in this appliance, and definately not worth the ...price tag. You can get much higher quality rice cookers for that price. All the ones I have seen used in my husband's family have the flip top lids (look at the other Zojirushi models). You may want to try one of them instead of the glass lids. And don't worry, the rice will still come out perfect."
4,excellent non-stick cooker,"I've used this only 3 times, so I'm still experimenting with the amount of water. As others have noted, following the directions produces a somewhat soggy rice, but cutting back around 10-15% has just about got me to the rightr place. However, cleanup is fantastic - no sticking at all."
2,Not what I expcted from reading other reviews,"Most reviewers before me loved this product. I was not at all satisfied. I cooked brown rice. I rinsed it before putting it in the cooker. I read and followed all directions. Here's the problem: The cooker put out a lot of steam from the vent hole in the cover. After steaming for a while, it started spitting. I actually held a rag above the cover for a while so the counter didn't get messed up. When the cooker clicked off, the rice was not completely cooked, probably because too much water had vented out as steam. Adding more water would probably solve that problem; but since I don't want to stand by the machine with a rag each time I cook rice, I rate the product unsatisfactory."
3,Not top of the line,"Unable to cook more than a serving for three or it will ""cook over the top and drip down the sides"". It is advertised to cook six cups. I would be leary of trying that much. Otherwise it is okay. It is my first rice cooker so maybe a learning curve is required."
1,Messy Steamer,"First rice cooker purchase and was none too happy with the results. The lid has an open steam hole that shoots at least one foot into the air that leaves a messy ""puddle"" of moisture three feet in distance. Following manufacture instructions to the letter produced medium grain white or brown rice, cooked into an unsatisfying oatmeal mush consistency."
5,"Easy, good rice","We have used this a couple times now to make rice for family functions and it has worked perfectly! It cooks the rice quickly, evenly and keeps it warm in case the rest of the dinner isn't quite ready! I love it."
3,Did its job,"I am a big fan of this brand so I decided to stick with it when it came time to buy another cooker. It does more than cook rice, I made bread pudding in it and it turned out great. The only problem I have is my rice would have some browness on the bottom, did it overcook the rice? The warmer feature is nice to have to keep things warm for awhile. Overall, I am happy with it."
1,"Poor light design, noisy/messy, browns the bottom of the rice","-When you plug it in, the 'warming' light comes on, even though it's not doing anything. Really irritating if you set it up early, and don't realize it's not cooking (becuase you look at see a light on, which is will be when it's done)-When cooking, the vent in the lid 'whistles', and moisture sputters out of it-The rice at the bottom is typically 'brown' and stuck together"
1,Fifety dollars down the drain,"A total waste of money. The ""keep warm"" feature is on by default and cannot be disabled.It keeps on heating long after the Energizer Bunnies 5th generation is dead and gone.There is no way to stop it.The result? The bottom of the food is always burned.This is the biggest pile ""o"" crap I've ever wasted money on."
2,What's the point?,"Too small for a family of four. It's very messy - goop all over the counter and floor. And, after I bought it I found out that it's really only meant for white rice. We mostly eat brown rice. Overall, the old fashioned method with a pot and stove works much better. I'm not really sure what the point is for a rice cooker...."
1,Long Term Review (Bad Quality Pan),"It's expensive to be a borderline rice cooker of these type of cookers. Expect some burn rice at the bottom for most brand/type of rice if you don't unplug immediately after cooked. Non-stick pan is of cheap quality. The coating at the rim where the cover seats on started peeling after 2 years. Mine is made in Thailand. That should be a red flag!Recommendation: Either go for a cheaper one or go for those around $100 or more and most importantly, made sure it's made in Japan. From my past experience and reviews reported, all those units made in China or Thailand have a much higher failure rate and qualities are not as good than those made in Japan."
1,Water spitter,"It spit water all over the counter even though we put exactly what the instructions said. Maybe we are not meant to be good cookers of rice, or maybe this isn't a good rice cooker. I am not sure, but we returned it."
2,Unimpressed,We found it Amazing how this rice cooker produced rice that was both undercooked and scorched brown at the same time. Maybe if it had more than one button it could at least then be told what type of rice is inside and could perhaps adjust the cooking time. We didn't like having to tell it to run two cooking cycles for brown rice.
4,Fool Proof,"Excellen rice cooker with an added bonus of steamer for veggies. Vegetables can still overcook, though, but rice cooker turns off when rice is finished. And I like that I can put the components in the dishwasher. An appliance even my husband can use!"
3,It's ok,"I was really excited when I got this rice cooker, but have had mixed results with it. Sometimes the rice at the bottom gets brown, though I see that previous reviewer Debbie has a good suggestion for how to avoid that problem. Another difficulty is that rice blends (e.g., mixtures of wild and brown rices) don't cook through properly, and some of the rice is cooked while, say, the wild rice is still kind of hard."
4,made a mess,"rice came out just the way i like it,but there is a vent hole in the lid and water and steam came spewing out and the lid was moving around so water and steam was running over,made quite a mess,used 1 cup rice and water to the 1 line on the right side,not liters.i rinsed the rice also.hav'nt got time for the cleanup. any hints would be helpfull"
2,Skip This One.,"The good: the non-stick surface works great and is easy to clean.The bad: does a terrible job cooking rice. White, basmati, jasmine, brown... rinsed or not, 1:1 through 2:1 water-to-rice ratio, half a cup of dry rice to two cups of rice - it doesn't matter. The bottom always burns and the rice comes out gummy. It seems like the heating element is too strong - it finishes up far faster than it should. Add to that the fact that the hole in the lid sputters far more than any rice cooker I've ever used, and the ""keep warm"" function only serves to burn the bottom rice even more.I wish I hadn't thrown out my el-cheapo cooker when this arrived. It was tiny and didn't have a non-stick pot, but at least it made good rice. I know 2 stars is a little harsh, but if a rice cooker doesn't make good rice, there's no point."
2,My feelings are mixed on this cooker,"I have mixed opinions on this cooker. On one hand, it cooks rice quick (under 20 min) and the rice comes out REALLY good. The non-stick surface also seems to actually be non-stick. (It's very easy to clean the rice off.)However, as others have mentioned, this thing does spurt a fair amount of water out of the top and onto the countertop and floor when it's cooking. Some of the water comes out of the vent hole on top of the lid (I'm not even sure why this hole is needed because the last rice cooker I had didn't have a vent hole and it worked perfect for 20 years). But I've also tried plugging this hole up and water still finds its way out around the edge of the lid.I suppose I could cover the whole thing with a towel or something to keep the water from getting everywhere, but why should I have to? Seems like a design flaw to me."
2,Really disappointed,"I bought this rice cooker based on the first two reviews and I was very disappointed. I have used it three times with mediocre results. My biggest complaint is that a crust forms on the bottom of the rice which is precisely what I had hoped to avoid by purchasing a rice cooker. I also don't like the fact that you cannot store the paddle and measuring cup in the rice cooker (they don't fit). On the positive side it is easy to clean and the fact that the lid is removable is a big plus--in the past, I have used rice cookers where the lid is attached to the cooker itself and they are horrendous to clean."
3,Great rice but burns the vessel and bottom,"No doubt that this rice maker makes awesome rice. As mentioned in earlier reviews - make sure you take the rice-water proportion as mentioned on your rice packet. I am an Indian and use Basmati rice and didn't have a problem at cooking them. But I do have other issues with this product1. It DEFINITELY cannot make 6-cups uncooked rice. In fact even if you use 4 cups uncooked rice, it starts touching the lid2. I have been using this product twice a week for a month now and heating plate is turned brown in color due to the burn marks. The cooking vessel is also starting to show some burn marks now - this is very disappointing"
3,It's ok,"I bought this product because of the brand reputation. It's alright, but smaller than I imagine, and nothing special. Just buy a $20 something rice cooker it might do the same thing."
2,"low volume only,otherwise messy","cooks rice perfectly but splatters alot ,only good on less than 2 cups of rice. Also must disconnect the minute it's done or develops crust on the bottom.( must be good for individuals only ( no family portions).Does have a nice compact size."
3,Zojirushi Rice Cooker,"In general, this product works well except the heating system is too powerful that the steam/water from the rice always spill over my countertop.What bothered me the MOST was the product description did not say it was made in Thailand. I assumed I was getting a good deal for a Japanese rice cooker. DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Do you just want rice or steamed vegetables too?,"We returned this item without using it. A six cup rice cooker should be large emough for three people--we thought. When we saw the vegetable steaming basket my wife didn't know whether to laugh or cry. It was large enough for no more than two normal size servings. No second helpings, please! The instructions say that the steamer basket should not be used when rice is being cooked."
2,disappointed,"I have always used rice cookers to cook my rice, and have never had problems with the texture and consistency of my rice. After purchasing the Zojirushi, I was disappointed in its performance. The lid definitely does not stay secure and thus does not keep the steam in. It also creates quite a mess unless I put a towel over the lid. I will more than likely purchase another rice cooker to replace this one. I do not recommend this rice cooker."
3,Dry rice/spits is the main problem,"This is a great rice maker except for the fact the water runs allover the counter. The rice never comes out soft and tender. It's sticky and dry. If anyone has any suggestion, please let me know. Postive aspect of this rice maker is are the fact it's easy to clean and takes up less space than other rice maker."
4,Rice is good but....,"Great machine, great rice. Two things that I don't like are: 1) The steam that comes out of the lid tends to get the area around it pretty wet. 2) The lid is a pain to clean."
2,Warmer,"Just to let you know that the Zojirushhi NHS-10 6-cup Rice Cooker/Steameer & Warmer is ok for just cooking rice, but the warmer is not good, after warming for couple hours the rice on the very bottom is soggy on one side, but the rest of rice is ok--Sincerely, Lari"
4,"Overall, very happy.","I purchased this rice cooker over three years ago, we use it about once a week either for rice, or steaming veggies. It spatters water through the vent, but a dish towel draped over the lid took care of that problem. Its quiet, and it prepares rice to the perfect done-ness quickly. As for the browning issue by other reviewers, I stir once about midway, and that problem is gone too! And sooo easy to clean! Compared to several other brands I've used, I've been very happy with this one."
1,big disappointment,"After reading lots of reviews about a lot of rice cooker/steamers, I thought I'd made a good choice. Right out of the box I saw that it really isn't designed to cook rice and use the steamer insert at the same time, but I thought it might make such great rice that I wouldn't mind the inconvenience of steaming separately. Nope. The rice burned on the bottom even though I didn't leave it on ""keep warm"" for more than 5-6 minutes."
4,Very good product,"Before buying this rice cooker, I hunted for the reviews for all the rice cookers in the market and found this one the best that just suits my requirement. Although I read somewhere that it boils eggs as well.. that was the only disappointment. But this product does what it supposed to do perfectly with out any problems.I wished there was a intermediary between 6 - 10 cups.. I was initially looking for a rice cooker that could cook 8 cups of uncooked rice.Overall its a very good product."
3,"boils over, everytime","The final product is great, perfectly cooked rice. My biggest complaint is that the rice boils over EVERYTIME I cook it. I've tried different rice types, different preparation methods (cleaned the ride, don;t clean the rice), yet it boils over. In order to cook rice I have to place the rice cooker on top of a dish rag to sop up all the boil over. Perhaps I expected too much from this simple, cheap machine"
3,A mildly amusing stunt,"Today class, your assignment is to write a science fiction novel which uses at least fifty common science fiction themes. Free Zone is Charles Platt's answer to this challenge, and he proudly lists 71 themes at the end of the book. It's as light as a souffle, totally without substance. The characters are almost as hackneyed as the multitudinous themes, and the less said about them, the better. The one thing I really liked about the story was the idea of the Free Zone itself: after most state & federal government has collapsed, a section of Los Angeles secedes from the rest of the city and establishes formal anarchy, if that isn't a contradition in terms. The Zone includes LoveLand, the Mafia's X-rated answer to Disneyland. I wish Mr. Platt had stuck with that idea and developed it a little more, instead of running hog wild trying to bring off a meaningless literary stunt."
1,Not quite what I expected,"This product is advertised with the Msport logo on the top , however when the gear knob arrived there was an empty space on the top . Not happy at all , still waiting to hear back from the seller ...."
2,Digital disappointment,"After living 15 years in Ecuador I was quite disappointed with this DVD. Ecuador is such a diverse country, not only in terms of its bio diversity, but in the diversity of its people. There is also no insight into Ecuador's urban centers. Touristic resources can blend good insight with captivating images (I think of the great book Insight Guides: Ecuador), but this one falls short. I purchased it hoping to use it for a university course that I teach on Latin America. After reviewing it, I decided that the best use of this DVD would be to show some of the common tourist stereotypes of a such a diverse place."
3,Not Informative Enough for Travel,We are planning a trip to ecuador and although this video was nice and got us excited about the trip it offered no real travel details and covered information on only a very small part of the country. Nicely done if you are interested in just a taste of Ecuador -say 5 minutes in the Galapagos.
1,Justine Shapiro Self Indulgence,A very self indulgent piece of work by Justine Shapiro. Everything is glossed over. Several segments are shot in black and white and time lapse. She talks more about herself than Ecuador. The segment on Quito was only a few seconds long!
1,one awful toy,"This toy was a waste of time and money. I bought it for my son's 6th birthday and although it says it is for ages 5 and up, it was very difficult to follow the complex instructions and actually get the thing to work. He lost interest after a little while and although I kept trying, I never was able to get it to work. We returned it to Toys R Us the following day. This toy is a good example of bad toy design. I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
1,Not worth the money or the time,This toy was awful! We tried over and over to make it work and never could get it. Our 9 year old hated the waiting and got bored very quickly. This is not any fun and is definately NOT worth the money.
3,Not What I expected,"After reading the poetic, almost mystical, Cloister Walk, I was disappointed. In Cloister Walk, Norris consistently uses the Grail Psalms in her quotes of Psalm verses. So, I was disappointed to find that these Psalms were based on the KJV. Alas, the Grail translation is out of print! Too bad -- that would have been my preference."
5,One of the Best!,"Hands down I think this is one of the best horse racing documentaries ever. Lots of great old footage you can't find anywhere else of some incredible horses. If you are fascinated by the Triple Crown you will love this! If you're going to buy one horse racing documentary - buy this one, especially as it's getting harder and harder to find. I've watched it so many times I have it memorized!"
4,A must have for Italian music fans!,A great combination of talent. Lucio Dalla and Gianni Morandi get together for this album and literally move the listener... Veramente uno dei miei dischi piu graditi!!
4,Excellent!!,"Oh man... I heard the first beats of this album and fell in love... between my brother and i we have over 200 tekno Cd's of Trance, House, Jungle, Acid Jazz etc. and both of us agree this is one of the better ones! We always listen to it when we go to Part-e's and it gets us so psyched and ready to dance until 10am the next morning! all in all it's excellent!"
5,Great product!,This stuff is awesome for rest and sense of well-being. I have recommended it to others and they like it as well.
5,Must read,"I read this book very carefully. Even if you are familiar with the end game technique (the book is full of end games but modern practice) you can learn from it. Just one example. The general concept of ""Simplification"" is very powerful idea when you turn advantage into win. A simplify means unarm your opponent before he can establish counterblow. I dont recall any other book having a chapter for this topic.When you study this book you can have a feeling that chess is more and more philosophy then game. When you have advantage you just have to pick up the right idea and go along it. I advise play some positions from this book with chess software to proof that you've got good understanding of the topic.Finally I highly recommend all books of A Soltis."
4,Clear read on perhaps the most difficult part of the game,"I guess that I am not the usual reader of chess books. While I love the game and am having about 100 chess books at home, I am no longer active and stil stuck on decade long 2200 ranking. The only mode that I can happily read chess books these days is with two kids running around me, or with other entertaining activities in the background. So the only way I read chess books (which must be an insult to some authors -- like Watson's French book) is by READING. No chess board. Soltis's books in general are great from the chess READER viewpoint (like myself) and I enjoyed tremendously the clear writing and the detailed examples that can be followed directly from the book without getting a headache from complex variations. The only thing I would consider chaging is to have a few more examples to solve at the end of chapters. More practice would easily bring this book to 5 stars"
4,ENDGAME book,"It's a good book with a lot Diagrams and good explanations, the main problem that I see in it is that this ENDGAME book. I like endgame studies and this book as well, but it's says no where about this fact. For endgame there is a lot more interesting books, but this more practical, less encyclopedial and more real game book. Similar to shereshevky's strategy of the endgame."
4,Delta 46-250 Midi Lathe,"I have used this lathe for nearly a year turning pens, bowls andother small turnings without any real problems. The only complaint I have is that the tool rest nicks very easily and does not adjust to the large diameter (10 inch) turnings to giveproper spacing and support for the turning tool. My shops equipment is all Delta, including a 9"" table saw/4"" jointer thatthe owners manual is dated 1958, which I can still get parts for.That is one of the reasons that I buy Delta products. I would reccommend Delta products to anyone that is in the process ofbuying new woodworking machines."
2,jet vs. delta,"this person who wrote the last review must work for delta i have the jet lathe and have used the delta midi lathe there is no comparison. the delta is not close to being as good as the jet mini-lathe. the delta has a plastic door over the belt that is junk ,thats the best i can say about it.also the deltas motor seems to be a little weaker with more vibration. i would not take two deltas for my jet."
1,BORING,"I loved Savasana by Wah, so I took a chance on this. Oh God, it's banal and utterly boring. Don't waste your money."
5,The best Piaf collection,"There are many Piaf collections from which to choose, and aside from the big multi-disc set, all of them omit some important songs. This set includes almost all of her best (""Mon Legionnaire"" and ""Tu es Partout"" are not here). EMI also has a single-disc collection with most of the best songs, but it does not include ""Les Trois Cloches"", which you've got to have. My only real complaint about this set is the booklet, which has no lyrics. Instead, you get a brief biography in French, with a rather shaky English translation. The set includes the English versions of ""La Vie en Rose"" and ""Hymne a l'amour"", which pale in comparison to the originals but are interesting nonetheless."
2,The 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection is a better choice.,I don't really disagree with the other reviewers' evaluation of Piaf. She is truly one of the great artists of the 20th Century. I got this set; and then I got the 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection. This 2 CD set has only a few songs recorded in the late 50's and early 60's when recording technology could do justice to her voice. The 10 CD set has several CD's recorded toward the end of her career. The recorded sound is outstanding; and Piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end. I know the 10 CD is expensive; but I prefer it above anything else I have by Piaf.
4,Perfection mixed with soul,"It doesn't get much better. This is a great mixture of soulful, emotional cuts that make your heart long for the past. This CD's songs paint a picture of one tormented soul, who was able to express her pain through her music. You almost feel her pain as you listen."
5,Nothing makes you feel as if you were in Paris as much as her music!!!,This was an excellent purchase! You will not be disappointed. It reminded me of walking the streets of Paris and all things magical about the city. Edith Piaf is an artist whom everyone should be familiar with and love. She has such a great story to tell!
2,Great Soundtrack,I liked the movie a lot and I like the soundtrack. It seemed to reflect many of the emotions felt in the movie. The soundtrack sounded at times incoherant rather than multi-faceted like Will Hunting (maybe intentional). I believe it achieves its goal of providing the musical backdrop to a movie that will be remembered for decades.
5,"Great movie, greater soundtrack","Before I saw Good Will Hunting I had never even heard of Elliott Smith, but once I saw the movie I had to have the CD. While Danny Elfman's compositions and the other songs (especially Luscious Jackson's catchy ""Why Do I Lie"") are wonderful, Smith's music is what makes this CD - it's worth buying for ""Miss Misery"" alone. In an age where most soundtracks include predominantly glossy pop tunes, cheaply sentimental love songs, and unnerving punk rock, the Good Will Hunting soundtrack contains simple, sincere music that's a refreshing change from other movie/TV soundtracks."
4,Eclectic and Unique,"The songs were eclectic, and Elliot Smith is awesome. ""Miss Misery"" is so appropriate and deep that even I, a teenage girl who of course loved Titanic, felt it was robbed of the Oscar. It's so different from the other nominees, and the lyrics apply to Will Hunting exactly as they should.Otherwise, the CD was a treat; but I was terribly disappointed not to find more of Danny Elfman's score, which I loved."
5,You can hear Matt Damon's voice through the songs!,"The Good Will Hunting soundtrack is the greatest. The movie is my all time favorite. The songs make it seem like you're watching the movie; you can just hear Matt Damon's voice. Very good selection of songs, once again. I am so glad there is a Good Will Hunting soundtrack. I listen to it all the time. Thanks"
5,"Different, but extremly good!","E. Smith did a great job with the music for GWH. This CD was the best that I have listened to in a long time. The music fit the movie, and was .... just wonderful. Kudos to Smith for a song well done!!"
4,Buy this after you are already into the Adicts and give it a couple tries,"I did not care for this the first couple times I gate it a whirl but it has really grown on me. Swat Her is a great track. I Like madhatter, and concertadicto alot. This is a bit of a departure from their earlier punk recordings, but you cant expect people to keep playing the same tired punk chords their whole life. so if you like the adicts and already have songs of praise, smart alex, sound of music, and fifth overture, then buy this and i am positive it will grow on you too"
1,Ineffective Teaching Methodology,"The selection of words is excellent and I applaud the writer however, to only employ the auditory sense without the possibility of visual input is absurd. There should be a listing of the words in groups of ten at least to reinforce the learning process. I realize this is not a spelling program but the more modalities employed in learning the more successful the learning process. I purchased the program to use with a few students but given the lack of a listing and my lack of time, I will not be able to use it nor may I return it since it was opened."
5,Great item!,"It was a Christmas present for my husband, and he loves it! Now he has all 15 seasons. Merry Christmas."
5,Another Awesome Season!!!,"This is one of the best seasons because it's hilarious and has great storylines such as buying weapons, cheating in the Special Olympics, gettin' served, deal with Michael Jackson, stop immigrants from the future taking people's jobs, decide who is a bigger whore; Mr. Slave or Paris Hilton, and deal with woodland creatures who worship Satan. I highly recommend SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 8TH SEASON!!!"
5,What can I say about this...,What can I say other than it is SOUTH PARK and it's awesome. Go out and buy it already. You know you want to.
5,Season 8,"As the years go along South Park seems to be getting better and better. This season has some great classics, ""Good Times with Weapons"", and ""Awesom-o"". If you a fan you have to own this season because it is one of the best."
4,South Park season 8,"I got this for my sister, who is a complete South Park nut. She absolutely loves it!!! A great addition to any South Park fan's video library."
2,Virtually non-usable,"This thermometer functioned as advertised for about a half dozen meals. Then problems started to compound. First the base unit had difficulty connecting with the remote. It would disconnect spontaneously and get stuck searching for a signal indefinitely. Eventually the temperature readings started to vary wildly. The device finally gave up the ghost when any attempt to connect the remote would cause the temperature reading to max out. Everything I'm describing happened within the span of three months.Even if the thermometer worked, it's just not an enjoyable product to use. The buttons feel gummy and you have to push hard to get them to respond. Your target temperature options are limited to a handful of pre-sets and there doesn't seem to be a way to set a custom temperature alarm if you're heating something to a degree other than the normal temperature of beef, lamb, pork chicken or fish. It's simply a cheap product all around and there are many superior options for the money."
1,Stick with the originals.,"The main reason I checked this out, besides that it was more material from the incomparable Y.M.O., was that is had some Orb remixes of Tong Poo. I'm sad to say that Dr. Alex Patterson's remixes sound so completely different from the originals that they may as well be credited to him alone. The only bright spot to the collection are the two remixes of Firecracker which stick close to the original melody and add updated beats, which by now sound dated anyway. But hey, if you want to hear Y.M.O. mixed up with passe house beats from the 90's then by all means, seek this crap out."
4,An excellent product,"This is an excellent version of this Ayurvedic tonic--a good balance of the herbs in a tasty base. I found it very effective. I gave it only four stars because Amazon has inflated the list price: The company that makes it (Komal herbals-AyurBest) actually lists it for $24.99, so the ""reduced"" Amazon price is actually more than the online retail on the company's site. You do save a little on Amazon if you subscribe."
4,Ayurvedic tonic,"Very pleasant tasting, not as thick as I remembered the one i took many years ago, it thickens into more of a paste if kept refridgerated, but says on label to be kept at room temperature. Over all benefits of tonic will only be known when I take it daily for a longer period of time. I have ordered this to be sent to me every 2 months. Appears to be the real thing from India with all authentic ingredients. price is comparable to other brands i have researched."
5,Gigliola hits Japan!!,"Surprisingly,Gigliola's classic ""Pioggia"" hits the Japanese chart now,thanks to TV commercial of new automobile.I love her warm and earthy vocal and catchy sounds.This album is the best collection of her great songs."
2,Disappointing,"A thinly veiled attempt by the author to establish credibility as an historical and linguistic authority. Amateur in style, substance and scope, this novel does not deliver any new information. Vague speculation and trite phraseology combine to create a very disappointing read. Not recommended reading for those interested in the time period and subject matter."
5,Tatar Khan's Englishman,I was very pleased with the product as well as the timeliness of the delivery. It is the first time I paid more for shipping than for the product itself but the vendor's response was professional and great.
4,"Great Idea, Not Quite Right on the Design","I agree with some of the other reviews regarding this product. The games are a lot of fun. I consider this product well worth the price. There are, however, a few things you might want to consider before purchasing: 1) the games are not exact reproductions of the originals; 2) the design must have been based entirely on aesthetics. It looks cool, but is both difficult to hold and the reset button placement is one of the worst ideas I have ever seen (several accidental resets for me).That said, it really is a lot of entertainment for the money. Several of the games are quite good and it is really convenient. I recommend it highly, just don't think you are getting the original arcade quality."
3,"Good for the kids, not as good for the kid at heart.","If you are like me, you may recall playing these classics where ever arcade machines could be found. Kids will enjoy it in car trips, or just a great toy for baby sitters to occupy the children.The adults will remember how they ""snubbed"" these classics in want of the better sequels. We passed over Pac Man for Ms Pac Man. Gave up Galaxian for Galaga, and ditched DigDug for Mr. Do.Yes, the games are still good. You might want it just for the nostalgia. Heck, anyone who remembers the Pac Man fiasco of the Atari 2600 would have killed for this thing 20 years ago! But this isn't 20 years ago.Worth having for several reasons, the games are fun, but don't expect recaptured youth for 20 bucks."
1,Battery Issues,I haven't actually played this yet but my biggest issue is that this controller won't let you use rechargeable batteries which I have. If I could then no problem I could just keep charging them up but I don't want to spend more money when I don't have to.
1,disappointed,I bought this game for my younger cousin for christmas and to my disappointment I was told it doesn't work all the time. When he plugs it in sometimes he has to bang the controller in order for it to work. I was very bothered by that. I don't mind if a product is used but if it doesn't work properly then it should have been said.
2,"Great Concept, No Joy Joystick","I finally tossed this game system after becoming frustrated with its crudely-constructed joystick. Even a thumb-operated stick would have worked better than the substandard joystick Jakks went with. I think most the games stored on the system are cool and have their place in history, but the cheapo hardware make this system a loser."
2,"It's not the same, you won't relive your past","The version of Pac Man on this little unit isn't the good one you might remember. If you'll hark back to the Pat Benatar days, you'll recall there was a ""fake Pac Man"" that was released in the 80s. (The Pac Man itself was a little too round, the sound was off...something was amiss, yet many didn't notice. If you were a true afficianado, you noticed). Well, this fake one is the one that's shipped with this unit. And it's just as disappointing as it used to be. It's not the real pac man.Also, the Rally X ""radar screen"" that was in the lower right in the real game is overlayed on top of the actual driving screen. Not good.I think that Dig Dug fans will rejoice, however. It seems to look and work like the old one."
1,beware,"I bought this for my young brother and it worked once, after that when he tried to play it it would work for about 2 mintues and then turn the TV fuzzy so u could not see it. Afterwards I found out this had happened to several people who had bought this item. If u buy i hope it works."
2,"good collection, but I was very disappointed by Bosconian","The collection should have been good, but the versions of the games are not the exact arcade versions, so they just don't feel right. Bosconian is the worst offender. I was going to buy this gadget just because it had Bosconian, which was one of my favorite games when I was a kid. However, when I finally found a place that had one connected to a TV, I discovered that it was a console version! It had no speech, the ships were out of scale (the bases weren't huge compared to ships), the sound effects were weak, and (as I recall) it didn't even have squadron bonuses or mystery ships. Although I played Pac-Man briefly, I was disappointed by it as well.If this toy was re-released with emulated versions of the original ROMs instead of the console versions, I would definitely buy it and give it 4 or 5 stars, because it would be a true sample of arcade history."
1,Not at all like the Arcade version,"It seems all the TV games have a flaw or two, but the Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man TV games are both not worth buying.Pac Man by ToyMax is nothing like the arcade version. The sounds are way off, and the PAC MAN is a GIANT and so are the ghosts. Also the patterns that used to work do not work in this poorly converted game. If you are expecting a Pac Man like the arcade, DO NOT BUY. If you just want to play Pac Man that is similar to the arcade then you might like it. The joystick seems to be made pretty good on this Pac Man by ToyMax, unlike Ms. Pac Man which the joystick will break in a matter of days or weeks.It depends on whether you want a Pac Man like the Arcade or not, if you are expecting anything similar to the arcade DO NOT BUY."
1,Too Fast for Kids!!!,"My only real complaint is that the game is way way too difficult to play. The game ramps up the speed after the 1st level and even the most seasoned fan will have difficulty. There should have been a difficulty setting. My kids have lost interest, and so have I."
4,"Great idea, poor execution","I was just about to order a replacement for my Namco toymax when I checked some of the other reviews that just about all of them had the same problem. ""Toy stopped working"" or ""Joystick Brocken after 2 weeks"". Unfortunately it appears that this is the same for my most awesome toy. It was a gift that brought joy to my TV and then after 1 week nothing but distortion. That being said I wouldn't waste [the money] on the item when you can go buy one of the old floor models that you put quarters in. The difference is that at least it will work longer!"
5,Awsome!,"This game is awsome! It has these five classic games on it: Packman (fun), DigDug (even more fun),Rally x(somewhat fun) ,Galaxain (really cool) and Boscanian (my personal favroite.) I never really knew how much fun it was to go back to the time where arcades had joy sticks to move th charatcher around with."
2,It could've been good... :(,"I was so excited when I bought this, but the entire experience was a disappointment due to the design of the console.You have to hold this unruly awkward shaped little box down with a deathgrip to prevent it from tipping over which becomes a distraction from the gameplay itself.I wind up just giving up after about 5 minutes because my left arm and hand become exhausted from fighting against gravity. Once I've peeled my left hand from the console, it is imprinted with the jutting edges of the base and my hand becomes cramped.I went out and bought suction cups and double stick foam tape to attach the base to the table and that idea failed miserably.Also frustrating, I end up accidentally hitting the reset button every time because it is such a struggle to hold the console down. Whenever I start getting somewhere in a game I lose it all in a literal flash.It should be the game you're playing that's the challenge.. not keeping the console stationary."
1,Junk!!,"Save your money and do not buy this junk-The stick is poorly designed, and hard to hold..Get a real gaming system"
4,THE SEED OF A GREAT IDEA!,"Fix the joystick! It started to lose responsiveness after about 15 hours of use. After 25 hours it became a significant factor in play. They also need to slow down the games so they match the speed of the originals. Other than that I love it and have bought it as gifts for friends. It's a blast and a fairly accurate recreation. If you are going to do games like this YOU MUST BE TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL. That's a lot of the attraction. These games have been knocked off horribly over the years for PCs. It's good to see something that tries to be true to the original.Hopefully they will create a few more titles. Everyone has their favorites. Never cared much for Dig Dug or Bosconian. I would probably buy a crate of these things if they included Mr. Do, Ladybug, Star Castle or Donkey Kong."
2,Disappointment,"I received my MsPacman 5in1 game yesterday, and decided to play pole position first. After about 2 races and no harsh treatment at all, the whole game went squiggley and then didn't work when you would turn the yellow knob left or right(kinda like a steering wheel for the racing game). the controller seems to work for the other games, but it's really not even worth 20 bucks. The mspacman game is a cheap knockoff, nothing like the original. The sounds are terrible. I'm going to shop for an original old atari, that would be a lot better than this piece of garbage. I even bought the other 10 in 1 atari-style controller, and that is garbage too. what a waste. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OF THESE. TRUST ME! They need to be built better. I'm not even a little kid who might be rough on it, I was just trying to see if they'd be like originals from when I was growing up."
3,Fun!,"This is so cool! I like to play all the games. It somewhat eats up batteries, but it's worth it's price. Though I must say, with only 5 games, it isn't fun if you have it for something like 5 months. But it is COOL!"
4,Best Idea Ever Cheapest Parts,"I'm glad to see that people think the same way I do. Lately I have become this huge arcade fan. I found this used at thrift store and I must admit I was pretty impressed the games look almost exactly like the arcade versions. I have played this thing for hours apon hours and I am addicted. However, even after the having it a few weaks I can tell the joystick is breaking with every play. Ok I understand that not everything is perfect it couldn't be, but this product has a less durable joystick than my atari! Thats the huge disappointment I think, Namco please fix the joystick. However, unlike the rest of you I bought mine for 10.00 dollars and I collect pac-man so at least it is a cool display piece when mine breaks."
1,game plays very bad,"I was very dissapointed because this game does not show clearly, it seems to have problems with in the wires. My kids can not enjoy this game at all. I thought that it would be ok to buy a used game on line, but now I will think twice. I will stick to buying books."
5,GREAT DEAL !!!!!!,"the item arrived at my house in about 4 days and although this was stopped beiing made years ago, this is working great !!!!!"
3,Works fine.....now!,"I bought this as a low cost alternative to some of the other iPod clock radios out there and returned the first one because I was getting the same loud hissing out of the speakers like previous consumers have stated. When I exchanged it for another one, I got the same hissing. I tried multiple cradle adaptors and was about to return it again when I pulled the iPod up very slightly from the docking station. Once I did this it was crystal clear. Turns out the docking station plug is taller than most other iPod charger docks and puching it too far will create the interference.Sorry for being long winded, but long story short, now that I have it figured out, the sound is fine and for a workplace music player this is just the thing I was looking for. Knowing what I know now about, I would recommend it."
1,Disapointed,Looked good but sound was not very good. Power switch broke the first day. I returned the system.
2,Not good for Nano owners,"This is not a bad choice if you are looking for a clock radio for your workplace. It does not play an iPod as the alarm, so using it as a bedside alarm stinks.The adapter for the Nano is total junk. It does not fit in the slot at all without major modification and even then it will not allow a Nano user to plug it in.As stated prior, the connecter is poor. It distorts with the smallest movement of the ipod, so surfing through songs while on the dock should not be done. If you wish to surf, then I suggest one uses the aux input on the back. The clock does come with a cord to plug an audio device into it.The saving grace of this unit is the sound. Its good, not great, but good. I also like the seperate batteries for clock and speakers. This way one can change the batteries for the speakers without resetting the clock and alarm."
3,"low money, high sound","Pros: this little speaker set is really light, great sound quality, it's easy to set the time, alarm, andfind a radio station.Cons: you can't set the alarm to wake you up with a song from your ipod, and the connection sucks.where the ipod goes into the speaker set is very fragile. you have to be careful, and when you try to change the track, it starts to buzz and beep cause the connection is lost. just take it out, put it back in, and it's fine.great if you just want to listen to your playlists without song surfing."
3,Good for Kitchen or Bedroom and charging your iPod,"I got this as a Christmas Gift and have it on now in the kitchen. I think three stars is a fair rating on this item. It's a nice looking item and charges the iPod. However you have to constantly battle the hissing you will be hearing all the time! Especially on a podcast. It sounds good when you have music and the volume is up. You do have to move the iPod around until you have it just right, and even then I can still hear the hissing faintly.I would say go ahead and spend $20 more and get a much better system you will use more."
1,Why didn't I listen to the other reviews?,"Have had this product for a WEEK. Bought it to use in my cubicle at work. The sound is great for low volume playing. I haven't had any problems with static or feedback and I have used it GENTLY for a total of THREE times. As mentioned in some previous reviews, the power button has malfunctioned already and the unit will not power off now. I should have just made the plunge and spent more for a JBL unit, which I will do now. This product is NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"
2,Very disappointed,This was exactly what I was looking for: a thin unit with iPod dock and radio that could take up a small amount of counter space in the kitchen. What I got: a unit with atrocious radio reception and a left speaker that wouldn't work when the iPod was plugged in. I own an Emerson CD Radio that I've had for years with no problems so needless to say I was disappointed when I received this one.
1,Horrible Hiss!,"Got 3 of these at a store grand opening for under $20 each. They're not even worth that! The hissing is horrible, and you can't wake to your iPod! They're going back to the store tomorrow."
2,"Nice Looking, Not Nice Sounding","I bought this unit a week ago because it was less expensive than others and looked nice.I got it home and found the hissing too distracting. It also lacks features I'd like, including sleeping and waking to an iPod. Took it back and bought an iHome instead.Word to the wise: If you can, try out a unit before you buy it. Bring your iPod to Best Buy and plug it into the dock. It'll save a lot of hassle!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a piece of junk. I bought one for my son, 1 week later the on/off button stuck and broke. Sent it back, got a new one and on month after the new one came, the radio stopped working and the buttons eventually did as well. So I'm stuck with a non-working, non-returnable piece of junk. I will never buy another Emerson product. I went and bought an iHome product and he loves it, and yes, it still works."
5,Needed a New Battery,I have looked in all the hardware stores for a battery for my small hand saw. I use the thing all the time and the old batteries would lose power quickly. So glad I found one on Amazon. This battery charged up properly and works great.
4,Needed replacement,After 4 years of using 2 of these batteries in constant rotation daily they finally gave up the ghost. So I ordered more to keep my cordless lightMakita ML123 12V Fluorescent Jobsite Worklighton. I'm a heavy truck tech and use this 8 hours a day every day.
5,A new battery pack,"After 10 years the battery pack on my Makita drill quit accepting a charge, so it was time to buy another. The local Home Depot didn't have any of the type I needed, perhaps because it is an older model - so I turned to Amazon. When I got the new battery pack, it charged up fine and works well. End of story."
1,Purposefully engineered to fail!,"In the 4 years the I have owned the Makita drill I have owned 5 batteries. One of the 2.2 AH batteries failed within 6 months, warranty covered that one. Purchased two Ni-Ca in 2002 and they have already failed with only moderate use. At $90 to $100 for a pair, you might as well toss the drill as the other reviewer stated. Makita acknowledged that a year, maybe 2 is what to expect for their batteries; digraceful. Never again!"
1,Check your charger first before purchasing,Be aware that the web site does not state what chargers will work with this battery. I followed a previous review and ordered the 1222 12V 2.0 Amp hour vs the 1220 12V 1.3Amp hour battery. After receiving the batteries I found that they were not compatable with my charger. Had to return the 2.0 Amp hour and reorder the 1.3 Amp hour battery.
4,Pole Saw Battery,"This battery work well but not as well as I'd though it should, it seems to go through it charge pretty quicker but what can you do its the only one that fit to the saw"
1,DOA but return was easy,"Battery would not hold a charge, new out of the package - but Amazon made the return easy."
1,dead makita battery,"the battery you sent me was dead. it wouldn't take a charge. makita 1-800 tech support said to send it to their nearest service center, which i did. that was 3 weeks ago and i haven't heard back. dead battery and lousy tech support. not a pretty picture."
1,Makita 1925898-3 12 Volt Battery,"You need a ""0"" in the above ratings for items such as this one.One battery came and was chargeable. The other was usless. Due to the fact that these batteries were purchased for my property in Costa Rica I was past a month before I could return the bad one, and am in fact on my return to the US today with the faulty itemm not having been there in the interem.Items that are inclosed within hard plastic casings should have a manufactures date on the outside, especially items such as batteries that have a limited life, even if they are re-chargeable.I'm extremely disappointed with 50% of my purchase being unusable. This has considerably influenced any further purchases with amazon!"
5,"Forgive me,Paul","Yes, please accept my apologies for dissing you in the past.I have read over the years of your avant-garde music and love of Stockhausen,etc. You were also involved early on w/ underground press.I was of the mistaken opinion that your pal JL was the man in regards to musical experimentation.I couldn't have been more WRONG!Lennon was a hack compared to you.(Except for REvolution 9).This CD plus ""Rushes"" are absolutely awesome,as Chris FArley might put it.I really don't care for this type of music that much,but on these CD's your musical genius carries the day. Melody is the key. If you can't write a simple beautiful melody,yoou might as well forget it.Paul,you are a gift to the ears.This CD and ""Rushes"" deserve much more exposure. It is great music.Thanks,Fireman."
2,Just for collectors,"The sound is just a compilation of musical experiences. As we have Paul McCartney in it, I honestly was hoping that it would have interest things, but it is not what you find here. As a collector, it's an item I should have and that's all. I will listen again someday and maybe I change my mind listening more carefully."
3,Troppo lungo!!,"Questo disco sarebbe stato molto migliore se fosse durato la meta'. Infatti, a dispetto delle 9 tracce, si tratta di un solo brano, un unico riff aggiugerei, riproposto in 9 mix differenti. Di per se le singole tracce non sono male, i mix sono tutti piacevoli all'ascolto, ma essendo sostanzialmente costituiti da un unico riff, risultano troppo simili tra loro, e quando vengono sentiti tutti insieme, creano un esperienza d'ascolto ripetitiva, faticosa, e pesante. Pertanto,benche' la musica contenuta, contestualmente al genere proposto, sia comunque di buon spessore e contenuto, l'album nel suo insieme, per quanto detto, non puo assolutamente superare le 3 stelle."
1,Not a good choice to cook rice,"This rice cooker should be an embarassment to Zojirushi. Do not buy it.It lacks an on/off switch, but, more imporantly, it makes a terrible mess of the device and the area around it when you cook rice in it. It is nearly as easy to cook rice and much easier to clean if you use a pot with water than to use this device.You will be very unhappy if you buy this cooker. I have used it once and will never use it again--except as a door stop. There are other, genuinely useful rice cookers available here for the money."
4,Not a bad buy for the money,"Nice sized rice steamer and great if you have storage issues. The older version of this model comes with a grate (basket) to sit at the bottom for steaming vegetables, which really comes in handy. So was a little disappointed about it not being included. Was a good price compared to other prices on other sites for the same model."
5,nice!,This machine makes nice rice. I use this machine in the kitchen sink because it boils over and sprays water when I cook rice. It would be great if this machine has a retractable cord.
3,zojirushi rice cooker,"Years ago I bought a rice cooker made by National, a Japanese company. It lasted over 20 years. Later,I have tried Deck&Blacker;, Aroma (made in China). These products are a total disapointment because they last only a few months or a few days (for Aroma).I hope this Zojirushi rice cooker is a good one though it is made in Thailand.I would not mind to spend money on a good quality and reliable product.I think the company should tell customers where its products are made . That's very important selling point.Thanks"
2,"Bad lid, inferior design","I purchased two of these (large size and smaller one) for my family in the US. I use it when I am home for a visit. I have never been able to use this cooker w/o it spraying water all over my countertop. In short, I regret the purchase.I now live in Tokyo and realize that Zojirushi is just pushing an inferior product on the US market. You cannot even purchase a thin-lid rice cooker here, especially one w/ a blowhole in it that lets turns the cooker into a steady spray of boiling rice water every time it is used. Not good.If you are serious about cooking rice often, and not having to clean up your kitchen after each use, I suggest that you invest a little more and get a better designed product."
3,One significant drawback...,...is the lack of an on/off switch. We bought this a few weeks back and the cooking is generally good and even. The heavy glass lid was a vast improvement over the thin metallic one of our panasonic cooker.But the lack of on/off means you have to plug and unplug it from the socket whenever you want to turn the system on/off. That sucks.
5,WONDERFUL. Changed how I cook!,"I am totally thrilled. For breakfast every morning I cook Old-Fashioned oatmeal with apple and cinnamon in it and for dinner rice with spices, veggies, shrimp or fish and have a meal in a pot. I highly recommend The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufman which has amazing recipes. The pan inside has very slippery non-stick coating which I carefully wash by hand. I rinse my rice first which is how you prevent the spitting that some people report. You MUST wash the rice to get the starch off. Cooks brown and mixed brown and wild rice wonderfully. Great for 1 or 2 people."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"First off, it does not keep the rice warm, according to the owner's manual. Second, I defy anyone over 35 to read -- or find -- the measurement markers on the rice tin. I purchased it for my mother who lives alone. Very disappointing. You can find the same qualities in a 14.99 rice cooker/steamer."
1,overpriced and bad cooker,I have a $300 Zojirushi rice cooker that I love. I wanted a small one for the cabin. I figured for over $40 this one would be perfect. It is a piece of junk. I have actually thrown out oatmeal cooked in it and the rice is worse than cooking it on the stove. I feel ripped off.
3,Mediocre,"It works but... I had an old Panasonic that made much more consistent rice. This one is simple to operate and impossible to break without throwing it out the window, but it cooks differently depending on how much rice you are making. Measuring the water out is a bit tricky even with the provided cup and markings on the inside of the pot. I have gotten used to ""guesstimating"" how much water to use, but I really shouldn't have to do that.... I didn't have to with the old one."
5,The envy of all mankind,"This is the finest and most useful appliance I own. And, you do not need a college degree or additional stereo instructions to use and operate! At first, I fiqured 10 cups to be excessive, but it is easily consumed in no time because it is cooked to perfection. A real treat: buy Ellis Stensels Rice out of La. and cook up a batch.... You won't regret it!Eat on!!"
3,"Great rice cooker, but nonstick Inner Cooking Pan don't last long","We love this rice cooker, however, the pan doesn't last long, after 2 years of daily use, the nonstick layer is gone. The replacement costs around $60."
5,Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker,"Awesome rice cooker. Cooks rice perfectly with no attending, and keeps it warm for hours. We have enjoyed ours for years and this one is for our grown daughter. Worth every penny."
3,good for your kids,this version of transformers is good for your kids...adult fans will find t inconsistent with previous shows and badly acted
1,Not my first choice,Johnny Rotten must have been upset with his record company when he recorded this effort. The production is sloppy and there doesn't appear to be any attempts at song construction. It's simply Jah Wobble wobbling along while Rotten moans and rants unintelligibly. It wouldn't surprise me if all the tracks were recorded in one take and in one day. Blah blah blah PIL's first album is much better.
2,Not much fun,"The Radica Cube World Block Bash isn't nearly as much fun as I thought it would be. Basically, it isn't worth the money spent. We have all of the Cube World people and this item should have been an excellent add on. Unfortunately, the getaways are very limited, so it becomes boring very quickly. The little guys are way more interesting. Stick with them."
3,Three stars for three good songs....,"I read the reviews and the comparisons and I must say, I am a little disappointed by this album. I like about three songs out of 12. And it is not at all like Portishead (with the exception of a scratchin' groove in the middle of the soaring strings of ""Future"") or Massive Attack. If I were going to liken them to anybody, it would have to be Morcheeba. And although I like Morcheeba, I can only take them in small doses. This album is heavy on the atmosphere and very spacey. Overall effect: very, very sleepy."
3,Point made clearly,"This is not a bad c.d. It's good to listen to for something different. Most of the music is very interesting , highly listenable and sophistocated...that is until you hear the naive girly vocals on some of the tracks. Otherwise, Soma Sonic makes their point clearly and I think they are on to something. More than likely I will buy future releases by Soma Sonic."
4,A slight disappointment.....,"I read all the reviews posted here and the comparisons and I have to say.....I'm a little disappointed in this CD. It's a little too atmospheric. Maybe it'll grow on me. Very spacey --which isn't a bad thing! I just don't see the Portishead or Massive Attack comparisons. It's more like Morcheeba. And Morcheeba I can take in small doses -- not enough for a whole album's worth. ""Falling"" is a definite standout, but it's five songs in. ""Future"" features a large string sound over soaring vocals and a little Portishead scratching in the middle -- nice. But it's overall a very, very sleepy album."
1,Boring!,"This book is unbelievably boring. I had expected to have a Rainbow Fish story as well as some counting games. There is no story. Each page only asks ""How many of Color X do you see?"" It progresses in order through the numbers (1, then 2, etc.). You then can do some other counting activities. Save your $ and just practice counting with your child with ordinary household objects or with a regular counting book."
2,Not my Favorite Glenbrooke Book,Maybe it's because i didn't have a high school sweetheart and i couldn't relate to the storyline but I really didn't enjoy this book as i have the other ones. It wasn't a bad read but the characters also didn't seem to have as strong a build-up as the other stories i have read by her. Especially Jonathan --- his character seemed kind of weak and didn't peak my interest. I know that all the other reviews are strong and I respect them but I have to be honest here on this particular one. But I love Robin's work and think she is an awesome writer. I can't wait for her to do a new book since the only one i haven't read yet is waterfalls...
3,Needs a Balance,"I am sort of distressed at the situation I am writing about. Mrs. Gunn has one major problem in this book: NO BALANCE. The ending surpasses the rest by far. The sweet and timeless ending of true love makes the rest look like the remnants of the holidays. SAD. However, it still has a good plot and gracefully moves the series on to the 6th book."
4,The more that I listen to it the more I like it.,"My first experience with Bride was ""The Jesus Experience"" and I prefer that album to this but the more I listen to this the more I like it. It is heavy, southern fried metal that goes down pretty easily. From the simple fun groove of ""Time"" to the energetic ""Thorns"" (all of these songs are energetic, what am I saying?) to the great lyrical contemplations and questions asked in ""Place"" Bride hits the right notes and doesn't often offend with bad songs (except for ""Dadmom"" which is crummy)."
3,"Not a worthy follow-up to its predecessor, but it's still good","3 1/2 Stars, really.How much you enjoy an album depends a lot on what you associate it with. I can completely see that if this was someone's first Bride album, that they'd have nothing but praise for it. For me, however, I got it right when it came out after having devoured nothing but ""Snakes in the Playground"" for MONTHS prior, and ""Scarecrow Messiah"" ultimately left me in wanting. I did love it for a really long time, but after putting it away for years and years and embarking on other musical journeys, I returned to Bride's stuff and found that the genre-bending tunes ""Place"" and ""Time"" were the only songs that REALLY stood out to me. It's not like I dislike the other ones (though ""Dadmom"" drives me insane), it's just that there's nothing amazing about them. Contrast that with ""Snakes in the Playground,"" where I go through weeks where I can't get that CD out of my player."
3,A re-usable filter with issues,"Until I received this filter, I was not aware that this is actually a re-usable filter and so it can last over 200,000 miles. However, there are a few important issues. To use this filter, you must follow the directions to wash and lube the filter with a special kit. So, this will add to the overall cost. This is the reason, they sell this so cheap (somewhat similar to printers - where you have to keep on buying expensive inks). The MAJOR ISSUE is however oil contamination of air-flow sensor. The oil from the filter can drip and contaminate the air-flow sensor and screw-up your engine and performance. My friend at the local Toyota dealership (service manager) stated that the damage from this type of filter costed a few of his clients about $ 400+ to replace the sensor. So, this will be the last Airhog I will buy. If you search internet on this topic, you will note that use of this filter is a very contraversial issue. I will not take a chance."
5,Nice rice,"As I make lots of rice, I have used many cookers. There is one of these at my office. It is a very nice cooker. It does not seem to make the steam mess others I have tried do, and when you liftopen the top to check or stir the the rice the condensation goes into a little compartment on the side. This is nice, just remember to empty the compartment so as not to have the waste sitting around. The pot cleans up nicely to. I only wish it had a ringer or buzzer on it to tell you when it to let you know it was finished."
2,Not so great shipping...,"The company shipped the cheese to my parents' house in Florida, but it was badly packaged with a disposable ice-pack (not dry ice) in the bottom, nowhere near the cheese, and left in the sun all day until it was, for the most part, melted."
2,Bad Paint Job,"Now that I've owned this for a couple years I'd like to warn buyers that the factory paint job does not hold up. My Jeep is garaged and only has 30,000 miles on it in 5 years. Within a year of installing this guard (which is a bear, getting the bolts to line up) the paint started chipping off. I started touching it up using Rustoleum paint but the chipped areas kept getting larger and larger. Recently very large sheets of paint have been coming off so I'm looking at removing the guard, stripping it down, treating any rust and totally refinishing it. This time I'll be using Rustoleum primer and finish coat(s). I would suggest any buyer of this guard refinish it before installing."
4,Kindergarten teacher,I bought this book and I have used it many times with Kindergarten kids. They enjoy the stories very much. I do find some the cutting hard and recommend practicing and/or drawing the lines before you cut as a guide.
1,Delta 22-680 planer shipped without 50-654 stand,"Delta introduced a this 3hp 15"" planer to catch up to its Tiawanese look alikes. The only problem is that Delta forgot to provide the stand. I have been waiting ten (10) weeks for this item to arrive. After contacting Delta Customer Service it appears that Delta cannot manage its off shore suppliers.I still believe that Delta makes a reasonable planer but the wait is just not worth it. A Jet or Powermatic 3 hp planer is essentially the same machine and delivery of the complete unit is assured. It is truly a shame that a good name like Delta is being managed into the ground."
2,It's O.K. not what I Expected,"I also had trouble getting the Stand and Roller Table from Delta. I wrote the Vice President of Marketing with Delta and told him if I didn't receive the Base and the roller stand in 10 working days that I would return it and Purchase a Powermatic. I received the table and Stand in 5 days... As for the Machine itself, it appears to have plenty of power even in Hardwoods. It seems to hold an Adjustment and seems to be pretty accurate. I hope that it has a long Delta Tool life, I was also Concerned that this Machine was not Produced in the U.S.A... A very large part of My shop, are Delta Tools that were handed down from my Granddads tool Collection. Knowing what I know now I would have done More Home work on all the Machines that are out there. I'm still waiting for the 4'' Dust collection adapter!"
3,For Carboni fans,"This would be my fourth choice for a newcomer to Carboni... Mondo, Persone Silenziose and the new COLLECTION soon to be released being the first three. Take a chance on those before deciding if you are a fan or not--the older the album, the less I love Carboni--though I still do LIKE this CD."
1,Bad Boots,"I purchased these in Oct 2005, they have been worn so little that there is no wear pattern on the soles and heels; however the upper is separating from the sole making the boots next to useless. Very dissatisfied with the durability of these boots, especially when campared to other brands I've worn."
5,Pope John Paul II is the best!,"This Rosary with the Pope is excellent. Once I started listening to it, I couldn't put it down. It has been about 5 years since I've owned this CD /cassette. I still listen to it often. The Latin language is easy to pick up. And, you can pray along with the Holy Father. It makes me feel as though he's in the same room. I LOVE IT!"
4,Almost exactly what I expected,"I was very pleased with this CD. As this is Pope John Paul II I was hoping it would include the Luminous Mysteries but the release date gives away the fact it only includes the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious mysteries. As mentioned before the CD is in Latin, which is what I expected since it is the language of the Church. I can see how some could be confused, in fact I did not know for sure what language until I first heard it, I had based my idea on assumption.For those like me who are post-Vatican II you can simply google Rosary Latin to get the words of the prayers so you can follow along.I found the sudden switch to English at the beginning of each mystery to be disruptive. The Organ is a bit loud at times, but after praying the rosary with the CD a few times, I began to enjoy the accompaniment. These two reasons moved my rating down from five to four stars."
2,don't waste your money,I purchased this CD as I love music and Judy Garland. This was Judy past her prime and the quality of recording and her voice was very poor. Save your money and look for another choice.
3,POOR SOUND HURTS JUDY AND HER PALS,"Here's proof that what sounds like a great idea on paper can flop when transferred to compact disc. The tunes on these recordings have been culled from Liza's mom's '60s small-screen variety series, but the less-than-stellar sound quality hurts, making them more grating than gracious. The rambling bits of dialogue feel hollow and disconnected when heard out of context; those wanting to hear Judy sing these songs should watch her as well. Geneon Entertainment will take die-hard devotees over the rainbow --- they have released Judy's entire ill-fated series on DVD, proving you can go home again. And again. And again."
2,A long research paper,"I agree with the reader from Maine. Although the story is itself interesting, I felt like I was reading an incredibily long research paper. Did anyone else get tired of the redundency of facts? Some incidents or facts were restated over and over again. All right already. In addition, all the extraneous information not really related to the story drove me crazy. For instance, the history and ownership of all the other houses in the vicinity of the brothel. I gave it two stars rather than one because I did find the parallels between the morals of 160 years ago and our own period fascinating."
4,Murder of Helen Jewett: Not What You Might Expect,Those readers in search of a true crime novel or broad history of prostitution in old New York will be disappointed with this book. It more closely resembles an anthropologic study which explores the lives and social values of the people involved in the life and death of Helen Jewett. I found the author's repetitive comments about male/female power relationships to be somewhat distracting and detrimental to her otherwise balanced treatment of the subject. This book is generously detailed and a very interesting (although not light) read.
5,College Book at a Great Price,I purchased this book for my daughter attending college and the quick turnaround to receive the item was fantastic. The book arrived in perfect condition.
5,wonderful toy for our family,"We are a family of five and 3 of the people use this toy a lot,especially my 2 year-old sister. She puts all of her fake dishes in there.My 6 year-old brother helps her but she says ""man das mine."" Between me and you i hide all of my candy in there.It's been disappearing a lot. i bet you 100$ it's my sister.But even after the loss of my lollipops candy canes and bubble gum,I think it's a great toy!It's pretty colourfull,and has every thing you can find in a real kitchen except dishes,pots,pans,and food.The problem is the colour.It doesn't look like the paint in a kitchen would but so far it's wonderful"
5,An Inductive Introduction,"If you want to learn greek, but tend not to fare too well with programs that teach you deductively--have you memorize vast charts of inflections--then this may be the best book for you. It begins with teaching you Koine--a relatively simple ancient dialect--with the Gospel of John. You translate your first verses without having seen a single grammatical chart! After John, you begin Attic greek with Xenophon's Anabasis. You pick up the language gradually, with practice, much as you would learning a language naturally. For me, this was the book that finally taught me ancient greek."
5,"Good writing, typesetting, provider","I'm very pleased by the writing of the book. Rather than the firehose technique and contrived exercises of, e.g., Hansen & Quinn, it uses *real* Greek from the Gospel of John and Xenophon's Anabasis to take the student from the very basics to more advanced Greek.I'm also pleased by the typhography of the textbook, which I find lacking in many of its peers. Using the page efficiently makes for a less weighty book, and good layout makes everything readible, searchable and understandable.Also, I like pseudo-leather book tape that it was bound in : very durable."
1,Worst book to learn Koine Greek,"This book is awful. It shouldn't be in print. It's a Paine to even read. The charts are bad, the grammar and syntax are very poorly explained. Perhaps worst of all, the book teaches by induction (throwing the entire book of John at you immediately) and then expects you to catch up. It's really really bad. For some reason, my graduate school professor has the class using this book and it's honestly created the worst academic setting I've ever been a part of. Once again, it's nearly impossible to learn from this book. Other students, myself included, have resorted to buying other Greek books to try to teach ourselves."
5,Don't waste your time on other grammers,"While attending UCONN I used this book to learn Classical Greek in order to prepare me for seminary. The aproach is more natural than noninductive methods that make you memorize everything before you even begin to read the Greek text!! Many other grammers make you write scentences!! What a waste of time! Greek is a dead language that is meant to be made alive through reading and translation! After using this text and reading other Attic Greek writtings, such as the Attic Orators, the Apology of Socrates and Horadatus, I was able to test out of beginning and advanced Greek in seminary and begin to enjoy the richness of the Biblical text! I cannot for the life of me understand why the text is no longer in print!"
5,if you want to learn greek,"...this is your book. It takes you through John's gospel first, so you can attend Bible study's and strut your stuff! But seriously, one couldn't ask for a better book on learning Greek."
3,Staples,The staples looked like they might have been exposed to moisture. My gun was new and it seemed to get jambed more when I used these staples than when I used new Bostich staples.
5,A Fantastic book,"The Origins Of Order is a fantastic book. Not only by it's thesis, also by it's methods.Errors, time and competition (natural selection) is so easy in order to explain all the complexity we see.I Spend much time in my work with complex problems in order to know all the details, collect the inputs, etc before I build a big spreadsheet and a power point presentation with my economic recommendations. Stuart Kauffman tells us other posibilities:with a computer, some skills in programming, common sense and knolowedge of the problem build a random model of the problem, collect a lot of simulations, and analize the outcomes. Not more, not less. You don't need more.And some times, change the computer by a pen and paper and build some equations. Not more, not less. You don't need more."
1,Great out of the box but.....,I agree with the other posts here about the drill. I have owned this for about three years but have really only used the drill on five different occasions. Today when I got it out I got half way through a hole and it just quit. I changed outlets and fiddled with it a little and then started again then sputtered and quit for good. I opened it up and checked to see if perhaps the cord had a short but it is getting power up to the motor so it is a bigger problem than I can fix.I loved this drill until today but honestly this thing has drilled maybe fifty holes tops and nothing big. It was always taken care of and never neglected.
5,SHOCKING,"This spanish group appears in the fist ninenties. The debut album was called SUPER 8. POP is the second one and it was not a great surprise. Planetas is not a POP band, they play the best psicodelic-pop I ever heard. POP is just the second step of a classic. The lyrics are really acid, and the music is absolutly delicious. This second album of the band contains a lot of styles: Beautiful love songs, sad songs, rock songs... Don't miss it. It's just perfect. David y Claudia gets the top 1 in my personal chart."
4,4 3/4 stars!,I use this every year for making some chocolate dipped cookies for the holidays. The tools included make the process so easy for producing what many people think are store bought cookies. For the price you can't beat this!The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the inside of the bottom pan lost some of the coating and there is a touch of rust. Since the food never comes in contact with that pan I don't worry about it.
3,Beach Party-what a trip!,"This is your typical 60's beach movie of the era. Robert Cummings is absolutely hilarious as the scientist who tries to figure out the teenagers of the day. And of course, I am a HUGE Vincent Price fan, and I was not disappointed. He only has 2 lines in the film at the very end, but what a way to end it! He plays ""Big Daddy"" :-) who is asleep through the entire film but wakes up at the very end to deliver ""the word."" It was too much. If you're a fan of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funacello, this is a great one for you."
2,The Saga Begins,"BEACH PARTY (1963) Directed by William Asher.Starring Robert Cummings, Dorothy Malone, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Morey Amsterdam, Harvey Lembeck, Jody McCrea and Vincent Price.An anthropologist and his wildly lust crazed assistant come to a California beach to study the mating rituals of the American teenager. Meanwhile Frankie and Annette have a fight.The first of the Beach Party films is amazingly enough for a teen flick actually a Bob Cummings/Dorothy Malone vehicle with Frankie and Annette in support parts. Slightly less surreal than the later films, this still plays like an extended episode of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND and is still exhibit A that teenagers before the 60s drugs and communist propaganda destroyed them were just another species back then. Completely unrecognizable to those who watch GLEE and listen to Taylor Swift today.Like all the Beach Party films, light as air. Not bad. Not good. Pleasant. And yes horror fans Vincent Price is in this movie!!!"
4,Fun and Foolishness that set the pace,"This is the one that started it all. For my money, I'll take ""Bikini beach"" for some fall-down-on-the floor laughter and no pretense of sense. But this sets everything up. Bob Cummings as the professor with ""pig bristles"" (which would not look out of place a few years later) is interesting, as he actually befriends the kids unlike stuffed shirt Kennan Wynn in the later film. But as usual, get ready to HOWL in laughter when Erich Von Zipper and the Rats arrive, and the professor teaches him the ""Himilayan Finger Technique"" that became a running gag through the ""Beach Party"" films. Erich Von Zipper likes you, you stupids, and you'll like this film also!"
1,Terrible product. Seems like a hyped up brand.,"Looking at reviews for many of the products from this manufacturer, I expected a quality product, particulalry considering the price. I could have purchased a B&D steamer for half the price. But turns out that this steamer is much worse. It spills water out all the time and makes a huge mess (with less than 5 months of use). I purchased a B&D steamer to replace it and it works much better. I intend to avoid this brand in future and recommend that other buyers be aware of the hyped reviews/brand."
2,"OK for odor-free, color-free foods","I bought this primairily to steam rice and it does a great job, but since it came with other attachments I thought I would try them out. The problem is that the plastic baskets absorb food odors and it's virtually impossible to get rid of. I also tried carrots and noticed an orange tint to the basket. On the whole it's fine for rice."
2,Only so-so,"This is a versatile appliance but since I purchased it to cook small amounts of rice, it's a bit of a disappointment. Everytime I steam rice, lots of water overflows onto the counter top. I am afraid that it will reach another appliance and electrocute someone or start a fire. According to the instructions, you're to add water to the bowl of rice itself, but it seems to be too much for the steamer to handle. The rice comes out perfect, but I think this will be my last time using it for that purpose. It sometimes overflows [from the base] when steaming other foods for a long time, so it's not always just the rice. Don't buy this steamer. Nice concept, not so smart design."
4,easy to use - hard to clean?,"...but it worked great first try on some carrots. Yes, it did put an orange ring in the plastic, but oh well. I'm not sure how to clean the water resevoir tho, since you can't open it and pour it out. I'm writing to Zojirushi and we'll see if they have suggestions.Definitely worth what we paid for it tho - a good bargain!"
4,Not the 1976 American Release,"Had to take one star off this remaster simply because it's not the original American release. Several songs key songs including Another Runaway, Everyday Of My Life and Broke Again are not on this version.The remaster does have outstanding sound, but the original playlist is what I wanted.Cheers."
4,Nice album.,"""Diamantina Cocktail"" #49 (1977).Led by lead vocalist Glenn Shorrock, LRB's 2nd album is a very nice 70's album. You get, the classic pop rocker ""Help Is On Its Way"" #14, ""Days On The Road"", a smooth number with great flute by Graham Lyall. The strutting ""Everyday Of My Life"", good vocal harmonies, the excellent ""Home On Monday"" and the great vocal harmonies of ""Happy Anniversary"" #16."
1,"Fantastic Music, Terrible Sound Quality","When are Blue Note going to realise they are custodians of some of the finest music ever recorded and treat it with the respect it deserves instead of peddling ever more perverse remasters. Here Shorter's horn sounds like it's coming out of a cheap wireless in the next room, a role usually reserved for the piano on Mr Van Gelder's efforts!"
5,3 hornmen!,"A hard bop and Blakey classic. With the addition of Curtis Fuller on trombone to the already all-star horn line-up of Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter, the sound is even more full and lush than usual. Compositons as well the solos are well constructed. FH,WS, and CF all have great solos on pretty tough material. Blakey is his usual hard swinging self capping off another great session. This cd has it all! Trumpet, tenor Sax and trombone. You can't go wrong here. Another wonderful production by University of Blakey!"
3,"Great books, but an out-of-date CD.","This product would rate 5 stars were it not for this shortcoming: In true Cisco Press tradition, the books in this set are an excellent source of training for CCNA candidates with little or no networking background, but the product ships with a ""Flash Card Companion"" CD (a test simulator) that's geared to the now retired CCNA 1.0 exam (no. 640-407). This test was retired in June 2000 by Cisco and replaced by CCNA 2.0 exam (no. 640-507). The new test is more extensive than the old version (e.g., VLANs, Spanning Tree protocol, and networking hardware). Not that the simulator is ""worthless"", but rather it is ""worth less"": you lose some value right up front, because you may have to invest in an up-to-date test simulator in addition to this product for full coverage of exam objectives. A call to the publisher for an updated simulator fell on deaf ears. They suggested I return the entire product for a refund, which misses the point."

2,"""High Capacity"" is Relative","1.7AH is no longer ""High Capacity"". Be careful about which type of battery your 12V Makita takes--thumb springs, end clip, both, or the new MForce slide design. If yours can take the thumb spring batteries, then spend $... more on the 2.0AH version. Your old charger will likely take it but may not take the newest NiMH batteries. Plus, the NiCd's have a longer shelf life."
5,REALLY GET A CHARGE OUT OF THIS,Have had this for quite a while now and have recharged it many many times it holds the charge well and runs my drill for a releasable amount of time.
1,Not up to Peter Green standards,"This album may include Peter green, but his fans will not recognize his playing on this trash!"
2,What is it?,"What to make of this cd? My version is actually called 'Two Greens Make A Blues' with an almost exact cover and the exact tracklisting as seen here. If you are a Peter Green fan and are looking for that trademark plaintive and plangent guitar, you certainly won't find it here! In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to identify Mr. Green at all. He is credited as playing 'Guitar; Bass' and perhaps he does more of the latter than the former, if any. What you will get is a gritty blues influenced album that certainly owes something to Captain Beefheart, as others have mentioned here. It's enjoyable in a way, but a bit of an oddity. So Green buyer beware - this isn't what you're looking for if you want to add to your classic Peter Green collection. If you want something more left-field and are satisfied knowing that the once-splintered guitar master is in there somewhere then go ahead and pick this up."
5,Can a Rice Cooker change your life?,YES! if it is this one. The perfect size that can do rice for one or four. Easy to use and clean. Well worth the price for the best cooked rice!
3,Excellent rice cooker but flawed - buy the larger model,"We've been using this now for several months and have been very impressed with the quality of the rice. We've made mostly brown rice but also basmati, all nearly perfect. It's also easy to use.The main problem is that the smaller model is difficult to clean. My brother has the 10-cup model and although it uses the same technology and produces the same quality rice it is easier to clean. The reason is that the smaller model accumulates rice gunk in the inside lid and it is difficult to reach inside. The gunk leaks out the back (there is a drain for it) whereas the larger model has no such drain, not needing one.Also, the 3-cup model is really too small, even for just the two of us.So don't hesitate to buy one of these - just buy the 5-cup or 10-cup model."
5,Steel Cut Oats Made Simple,I bought this rice cooker to cook steel cut oats. It cooks steel cut oats without the mess. It's fast and clean-up is very easy. I use it every morning. Sometimes I even add fresh fruit. Maybe I should try cooking rice with this machine. Not today.
2,surprisingly disappointing,"I bought this rice cooker about 3 months ago to replace an old Zojirushi that seemed to be not as effective at keeping the rice fresh and warm as well as it used to. I was quite happy with the old one otherwise, and for many years. I've used the new cooker about twice a week for white Korean rice. I have mostly complaints. First, there's no spatula holder. For this amount of money, it's ridiculous not to have a spatula holder. Second, the rice takes twice as long to cook (40 minutes instead of 20). Third, although I make only 2 cups of rice at a time, the cooker is really too small. Because 2 cups of rice, when cooked, takes up almost all of the space in the cooker, it is difficult to fluff up the rice when it's done. My mother said a 3-cup rice cooker was not a good idea. Why didn't I listen to her?"
1,The worst customer service !!!,"I recieved the larger version of this rice cooker as a Christmas gift. It cooked rice just fine but the cap did not fit properly so the rice dried out in the cooker (it is supposed to keep it hot and fresh up to 12 hours). I contacted customer service and they told me to do everything and contact everyone to get authorization, verification etc. They told me to jump through all types of hoops so they can get out of repairing or replacing the rice cooker. After over 20 phone call to all kinds of people they told me to call, I was so disgusted, I gave up. Zojurishi service is truley pathetic! If you get a good one, lucky you. if you get a defective one, just throw it out."
1,terrible,"i received this product and took it to Europe. Plugged it into my converter, no problem, walked away and came back 30 minutes later and nothing had changed. the product was defective!as a loyal amazon and amazon prime customer, the product was refunded and no problems. have yet to buy another rice cooker, but when i do it will be the hardier 10cup model."
5,a super yet small rice cooker,"If you are looking for a *small* rice cooker, this one is perfect. It is, in fact, smaller (both inside and outside) than I have expected. But I do like the compact design."
4,rice cooker,"This is the best rice cooker I've ever used (of 5 or 6). I'd give it 5 stars except that it sometimes has trouble (exudes some excess water) with a full three cups (Japanese cups, 180 ml) of rice, and is way more expensive than it might be. Still, its 'neurofuzzy' sensor is a work of art."
5,I love it I love it,"I bought this rice cooker about 4 weeks fago. I have been making small quantities of rice every few days. I find that the rice is so fluffy that I get more finished product than I would cooking rice the old fashioned way. Enough for 2 nights. And the rice always comes out near perfection...no matter what kind of rice I put up. I made steel cut oatmeal this morning and it was some of the best I ever had.I love being able to start the rice and then run out the do errands. Finally, it is a breeze to clean. I just gave away my old fashioned rice cooker. I will not miss it."
5,An amazingly great cooker,"I bought this cooker thinking that it would not live up to its hype. But I can tell you that it really does deliver the goods. I've cooked several different kinds of rice, brown, basmati, wehani, forbidden, aborio, you name it, and they all came out simply great. It does perform up to expectations. You can't go wrong here."
4,Not 3-cups,"Potential purchasers should note that when they say ""3-cup"" they mean 3 of their cups, which are 0.18 liters, or just over 6 ounces. Thus it has a capacity of 2 1/2 cups dry white rice. This is not mentioned anywhere in the description or box, just in the instructions. It appears to be of excellent quality, but as has only 3/4 of the capacity claimed, I'm sending it back."
5,Bargain,"I found this book at Barnes & Noble and was going to buy a copy for $16.99, then decided to check out my local used book store. They didn't have a copy, so here I am at amazon.com. Buy it here, it's a bargain!"
2,Weak characterizations. Boring ending.,"It seems that Mr. Furst got bored at the end, even allowing a major typo in this context of getting critical dates mixed up (July 5th coming after July 7th!) and putting his main character where he wanted him to end up without any details of how he got there - details that often made the rest of the novel satisfying. What saves this novel is the solid atmosphere created in the beginning and the mostly-credible dialogue of the characters. But Mr. Furst should really think through what he has to add this genre before going back to this period."
2,I love Furst but....,"This is not a novel into which he has put much effort. I have read every book in Furst's admirable series about men and women caught up in the resistance movements of World War II and I have enjoyed every one until ""The Foreign Correspondent"". Books like ""The Polish Officer"" and ""Kingdom of Shadows"" are worthy of the highest praise but in this latest effort the plot is a recycled one; the action is thin; the use of recurrent characters has now reached joke proportions. Please, Mr Furst, either get back your interest in this series or move on to something that engages your considerable talents."
5,Another atmospheric thriller by Alan Furst,"I eagerly await each book by Alan Furst, because I know that he will deliver a solid story, populated by believeable characters, and a sense of impending calamity on the eve of World War II in Europe. This latest book is no exception, and I relished every page of it. Mr. Furst likes to include in his works characters and places from his other books, and it's always a delight to meet them again. In this book we have a world weary correspondent working for the literary resistance to Italian fascism, his co-conspirators, a beautiful German woman involved in anti-Hitler plots, and all types of assorted spies, policemen, guards, etc.. The plot moves along, taking us closer to the beginning of the war, but ending before that date. Reading this book will keep you up late into the night to finish it!"
1,"Let us help you, Alan--if Random House won't","I have to agree with everyone who found The Foreign Correspondent a listless rehashing of increasingly shopworn characters and effects. Carlo is Casson without the freshness or depth. The scene at Henninger's, featuring protagonists of earlier and better novels, is a joke on the reader. Doesn't Furst have an editor? Or does his ms. go straight to the printer? Here's an idea: if Random House can't afford to provide Furst with an editor's advice, why not show the draft of his next novel to 20 typical readers? I'm sure the result of such a process would be a book in keeping with what we all know Furst is capable of. What do you say, Alan?"
2,Please say the book contract is complete?,"This book is yet another lazily plotted Furst disappointment and it joins the last two in return-to-seller. Reading it, you get the impression that old research pieces are reviewed for re-use and then cobbled together in a haphazard sequence of non-events. Where is the writer of the earlier books?"
4,Good Alan Furst- worthwhile read,"The Foreign Correspondent is set in Paris: the city most evocatively described by Alan Furst in the WWII era. While this book does not have the same impact of some of his other books, you will enjoy reading it. Don't lose the pleasure of an Alan Furst book because of some people's bad reviews: I almost did but was very glad I finally read it."
4,Another excellent Furth novel,"Alan Furth is a first class historian and storyteller. There is a sameness to many of his pre WWII spy novels, but they are beautifully written, with compelling and erotic love stories included at no extra charge.His work is also highly educational as his books powerfully evoke what may have been the most interesting time in human history. He accomplishes this feat by elaborately dedtailing all of the minute circumstances of day to day life lived in the shadow and mist of WWII's undercover operations.Furth's stories and writing are a cut above all else in the historical spy genre, they actually transcend it. His work is not for the ponderous reader, but rather the spy and historical novel connoisseur who knows how to discern a novel which is a Pinot Noir from one that is a Cabernet.."
2,Yet another overcharge,"Before I read the book I need to note that the ebook is a dollar more than the printed paperback. This is why the publisher-monopoly has to be broken. The book has less formatting, no shipping, no material costs, yet the publisher wants more for it than for the material book. We readers really need to protest this every time it happens. Every review should note it."
3,my third furst,"This was my third Furst novel in quick succession (following Spies of 1) Balkans, and 2) Warsaw). This one could be Spies of Paris. Furst has his formula, and it is good--not great literature, but addictive. He's the ""In and Out Burger"" of spy novelists--good quality, reliable, not particularly gourmet, and his heroes are in and out of a lot of things in the course of the novel."
2,Badly disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book, after reading reviews in the WSJ and the LA Times. And pre-war Europe was my fave epoch.But Furst doesn't deliver. He violates that first commandment of writing, ""Show, don't tell."" He tells, and tells, and tells. Carlo has no unrevealed nuance.I kept reading to find out the traitor in the Liberazione circle - and when it is revealed, so what?Yes, the period detail is lush, excruciatingly so. Carlo goes to Spain, Carlo goes to Berlin, to Prague, to Genoa. Again, so what?The love scenes are clumsy, the sentence fragments are annoying.I'll not bother to read any more Furst."
4,Europe In The Shadows,"Not Mr. Furst's best novel,but very good. A must read for Furst fans anbd those who enjoy the Greene genre."
5,A fine continuation of Furst's string of fiction,"There is a verite' to Furst's creation of World War Two as seen from the the ground up. The focus of his string of interesting novels is about the atmospherics of resistance' as carried out by the foot soldiers, spies and journalists; all waiting for the heavy boots on the stairs, the knock on the door, the anticipation of arrest.Furst paints this scene with a splendid mosiac of small scenes and a sparcity of words. His novels get shorter, more intense each year as they come off the press to the eager reader."
3,His worst novel yet,I've read all his other novels. This is by far the worst. There's no intrigue or suspense
2,Short and Shallow,"A short and shallow effort, lacking the thought and imagination of most of Mr. Furst's previous efforts. Maybe he should try something else."

2,Relatively uniformative.,"Despite the number of pages, this book does not go into much detail. The GIMP Visual Quickstart Guide by Davis is a vastly better introduction."
4,Solid Overview,"Although it doesn't cover everything that the Gimp is cabable of, it does what it's name says. It goes through almost all the plugins and gives you a good example of each one that you may not have seen before. Worth it for people who know a good deal about Gimp, but are feeling a little stuck."
2,Don't buy this book !,"If you are looking for something complete DO NOT BUY this book. You will regret that, belive me. Try to read instead ""Gimp User Manual"" by K. Kylander & O Kylander (which is shipped for example in the package labeled ""gimpman"" on SUSE distributions). You'll find everything there from how to compile and install a plug-in to how to use and write scripts, really everything"
5,A delight,This is a solid CD start to finish. I bought it 15 years ago and it's now one of my 20 favorite CD's. Terrific mix of music and easily the best Church CD that I own.
5,This is how my Lord really is!!!,"Thank you Bruce Marchiano, this is how my Lord really is!!!! Unconditional love, humor, and deep compassion for all. What a blessing to see what HE is really like, I know. Mr. Marchiano said this film changed his whole life.!! It has also changed many more lives, if you dont see it, you are missing the best."
3,Get John's Gospel First,"The Visual Bible's Gospel of John has much better acting and production values, but is based on a slightly more obscure (and, in my opinion, awkward) Bible translation. Matthew--and Acts, for that matter--are not bad, but they were clearly direct-to-video and not intended for theatrical release. I use the DVD for an adult Sunday School class--we watch a chapter several weeks in a row and then discuss a different aspect of the chapter before moving on to the next one. (It'll probably take us over a year to get through Matthew.) For that purpose, this DVD is a good tool. But I don't think that I'd want to sit down and watch this film straight through."
5,very pleased,The DVD is one of the best decriptions of how I feel Jesus was. I loved it. It was in great shape.
3,Hard to take Jesus serious,"I love Jesus since he's all I truly desire; however, after watching this, it was hard to take Jesus seriously. He smiles almost non-stop even when he was preaching serious stuff. I did like how this Jesus shows a warmer, friendlier, and playful side, something other movies fail to show more off, but they overdid it. One scene he talks about hell and he's playing with the kids."
5,Matthew: Visual Bible,I love watching this movie of Matthew. It is so well put together that it just makes the book of Matthew COME ALIVE!
1,Get the Gospel of John,"I agree with other reviews that this film has an irreverent Jesus who makes me uncomfortable watching it. Henry Cusick is absolutely excellent in The Gospel of John, so order that instead."
2,Like Nicholas Cage Doing Stand-up Comedy?,"Watching Bruce Marchiano, with his forced syrupy smile, is like a Nicholas Cage comedy act. Hard to imagine or just plain creepy? Which is more believable: Marchiano's Jesus hopping around with a ""plank in the eye"" while everyone laughs at him, or Nicholas Cage doing anything funny? Ponder this while wondering if you really care and you will see why you should decide to pass on this movie -- it is just wrong."
1,Disappointed.,The Gospels of John was amazing. Jesus of Nazareth was great. This DVD sucked. The acting was bad & with no feelings or emotions expressed. It was similar to watching an auto book (if you could imagine that). The movie follows the Gospels of Matthew word by word. That's the only reason I gave it even 1 star. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this version. It might bore you to death.
3,"Well done, if you can watch it.","I watched the VHS version when it first came out and enjoyed it. When the price of the DVDs came down I decided to buy it. However, I've not been able to get the DVD to play on my computer DVD-ROM or any computer's DVD-ROM for that matter. Anyone had this same problem? The DVDs are useless to me now since I don't have and don't want a TV but I can't get the Marketplace seller I purchased it from to return my emails requesting a refund."
5,It brings the scripture to life,"In our Sunday School class we will watch 2-3 chapters, and then discuss what we saw. The class can get a feeling for the way Jesus lived, and touched people, while having the scriptures acted out."
1,Disappointing Waste of Money,"I purchased this DVD after watching the new Gospel of John, thinking it might be of similar quality. There is no comparison. The Jesus in the Gospel of John has the air about him of the Son of God, Kingly and Regal, yet a man of sympathy. The Jesus of this video strikes you as a happy-go-lucky American funny guy, part used car salesman and part favorite uncle. This Jesus goes about hugging and kissing people and giving his disciples ""Dutch"" rubs. Needless to say, we didn't get very far into this before giving up. The Bible says that Jesus spoke as one ""having authority"". Not this Jesus. This Jesus might be the Jesus of the average American's imagination, not the Jesus of the Bible. I am sorry I couldn't rate it any lower than one star.Added November 11, 2011 - I am currently in the process of a study on the Sermon on the Mount, ""Blessed are they that Mourn"". This study has reinforced my thoughts on this video and its failure in presenting the biblical Jesus."
4,Very Helpful,"We occasionally use this DVD at our church for a scripture reference instead of a power point slide. The video quality isn't the best, but the acting is good. I'd recommend it."
2,Matthew,"The actor-if you can call him that- Bruce Marcianno, is HORRIBLE ruins the whole gospel. He is like a Jesus on LSD. His imitation of Jesus is blasphemous. Can't recommend any film that has him in it to my unsaved friends or family. Shame they did not use the same cast as the gospel of John."
1,Unwatchable,"This film is as bad as The Gospel of John is good. I fully understand why viewers would be attracted to the smiley Jesus who is always touching and kissing people; there could be a certain charm to that but for the fact that the man playing Jesus has virtually no acting ability and delivers the texts in a flat accent with oddly placed emotional inflections. Hard to believe that this film was made by the same production group that had seen fit to cast Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus (albeit after this laughable mess of a film, and thank God they did) Overall, it looks like someone's bad home movie combined with the typical Cheese Whiz costumes and overacting that are the stock-in-trade of the majority of Jesus flicks. I am glad I saw The Gospel of John first or else I might never have tried it at all."
2,Not Gospel of John,"If you think it's going to be as good as the Gospel of John, don't be surprised when it's not. I was a bit taken aback by Jesus's smiley antics (e.g. laughing at his own jokes, palling around, etc.). Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Jesus had fun too, but he would not have... been... so... WHITE. The whole movie, he just kept seeming like someone's goofy uncle rather than a teacher/savior. I guess you might like this movie if you're into the whole ""fun guy Jesus"" thing, but I didn't."
3,Stretching For Realisim,"I was impressed at how close to the Bible the movie was and loved the way the director portrayed Jesus' personality. However, I saw a couple of things I felt should have left out. Like when Herod had all the babies killed... we don't need all the 'realism' that secular movies emphasize (Christians should uphold a higher standard). Also, at the last of the movie when Jesus was being crucified one woman was crying and her nose mucus was a bit too much and the director seem to think it was important to keep the shot on her for too long - and as if once wasn't enough he had to show it again... same amount of time. In my opinion the movie was poorly directed. Nevertheless, it was a good movie and stayed close to the Bible. I do believe it was worth the money... I just wish it had been directed by someone with a little more finesse."
2,Good idea...poor acting.,"As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well."
1,No See,Have not been able to see this DVD was sent the DVD twice and both were defective. Was not please with Amazon since I tried to contact them and talk about the problem as to date have not heard from them and can find no number to contact them. Would like to see the movie will be trying to contact Amazon.
1,"Worthless replacement battery, didn't last a year.","I paid for the Makita name on this battery, and it was headed south within six months and useless after a year -- and I'm not a heavy user, just a normal household kinda guy. Save your money."
4,Farm Mechanic,"I bought this Battery for my old drill.The battery was just what I was looking for,I didn't want to throw a good old drill out just because the battery got old.The price was right and the shipping was fast.I would recommend this company to my friends and family !!!"
4,quick shipment,"Works great, but did think it was going to be an original Makita...not a rebuild. We could have gotten another rebuild cheaper. But no complaints."
3,Albert Collins,"I bought this on watching a Robben Ford tutorial DVD, he claimed that this is the ""best"" blues guitar CD ever. Well Robben, while I love your playing, your ""taste"" is questionable. Yes, great guitar playing but the SOUND...sheeeeeesh....recorded live and sounds it....mushed, grungy, no detail. I would only give this a 1 star, but the man himself and his playing deserves better, so it rates a 3."
1,Really Bad Puns.,"If I were the author of this book, I wouldn't put my name on it.When the discription said, ""groan worthy"" they really meant it.500 puns guaranteed to drive you across the Rio Groan-de! is one of the better ones.I bought this book as a gift for my spanish teacher, but I think I'll give it to my waste basket instead."
3,Dark as night!,"Bad VHS copy, a real dark ambush. The quality rating didn't match reality. A pity because this true story is great and Dirk Bogarde, perfect."
5,Literally can't live without it,"Being vegan, I eat a lot of rice. This rice cooker has made making rice a joy, and I usually make a combination of white and brown short grain rice- as long as I measure correctly and fill the water up to the line as it says in the instructions, they both come out perfectly, every time. I've steamed some veggies and made some congee, and no surprises, just great yummy food. But, I did get tired of having to yank the cord out whenever I turned it off, so I got a 1.00$ part at the hardware store so I can just flip a toggle switch instead. It keeps rice warm for days, so I only need to turn it off after I have cleaned it and there is no rice to be cooked. I wouldn't use another rice cooker if you paid me! I love it."
3,Check the rice type before you choose this one,I got this cooker based on the reviews and rating but now I am returning this after trying this for a week. The cooker has excellent features and retractable cord for easy handling but has some flaws in its design in adjusting to rice types. we were using basmati or parboiled rice and the manual doesn't really say how much water adjustment we need to make based on the rice type . The rice was boiled fine only at the top and at the bottom the rice had burnt and had a brown color. We tried several water levels with the rice but the burnt rice at the bottom was always the problem. Think twice before choosing this brand of cooker
3,Jimmy Smith's First Blue Note Album on CD,"~ While this CD does offer you the opportunity to buy Jimmy Smith's first Blue Note recordings ""A New Sound, A New Star - Jimmy Smith at the Organ Volume One"" (Blue Note Album 1512) you can obtain the same material plus an additional 19 tracks for a lot less money on the Blue Note 2-CD setNew Sound New Star.~ The reason for the 3-star rating is not because of the music, but it is because of the value - why pay more money for less music, when Blue Note offers more music for less money. See my review ofNew Sound New Star"
2,Nice sounding strings...,"These strings look and feel great. I did seem to me, however, that they stretch much more than others I have used. I may have gotten unlucky here, but my D string broke after only 2 weeks of putting these on the guitar."
3,Good Budget Strings,"I'm an intermediate player who changes strings maybe once a year. I usually purchase the cheapest strings I can find. These strings seem to be satisfactory. I did have one issue with the high E string. A day or two after putting on the new strings, the ball connection on the High E failed. Fortunately, I had not trimmed the excess off of the strings yet, so I still had enough string left over to manually tie a knot. I have played on the strings daily for about a month now, with no other issues. If the price is right I would consider buying these again."
3,high E sucks,"Snapped my High E in just a Couple of day. I bought another pack to replace the high E because there cheap but, if u have the buck some Tie ons... Ball ends snap easy. I would Recommend the La Bella brand thats the next pack im getting."
1,Terrible,"These strings feel terrible when you are used do Dada EJ46.I bought them only because they were cheap, and so they look and feel.Tone is not bad, but it's not playable at all.And did I mention that it has been a week and the tuning is still not stable?"
1,bad,"The selection of songs they used for this recording is good enough.The problem lies with the performers (hauptmann-a bas vocalist)and the lousy effort that has result.In othe words naxos should go and record the whole Mayrhofer volume again,only next time use two professional performers who know Schubert well,instead of lousy ""art song amateurs""such as the two we have here."
2,There are better options out there,"Not the most well-written book on critical reasoning. Unfortunately, I think they're just not good teachers, so the content comes across dry and boring when critical reasoning is actually a fascinating subject. I would suggest Critical Thinking: A Student's Introduction by Gregory Bassham instead."
4,Not so nutty Knots,"This book is actually pretty good, but more for someone who has done knot work before. I dont know that i would necessarily recommend this to a beginnner that has never done any knot or macrame work before since the patterns do not give a step-by-step illustration of what to do and this might prove difficult for someone just getting started.I actually had another copy but it went on a journey of it's own and so i bought a second copy because I like to have a reference for some knots I dont use that often."
5,I had this book for a few days...,looked at it for a few minutes...my mind was blown with new knot techniques...I made 6 or so new pieces right off the bat. I do think you should buy this .I'm one of those people who's into about a million different hobbies and there are quite a few things that I pick up and I don't finish...this is one of those things that's quick and you will finish...then you can gift all the cool shit you make to your friends !
5,All the secrets knotted into one!!!,"The basic knots are taught first..which is the best basis to do more difficult progressions of knots. There are patterns that could look a bit confusing..but, it's truly about following the instructions. Just about every project has a picture so you can check your work against it. This book is the essence of what hemp jewelry is all about. It's not pretentious at all. It's very straigt forward information. It's a must in any hemp jewelry makers library collection. It's also good for beginners...as it's very clear with it's instructions..a valuable book for learning how to make uncommon and very lovely work."
3,Book was somewhat helpful,"Hemp Masters was reviewed as one of the best when I first began the searchfor a hemp knotting book. And while I did learn a couple things from it, theknotting patterns where relatively difficult to follow due to poor picturequality and instructions. And if youre knew to hemp jewelry I wouldnt recommend this book.The first half of the book goes over the beginners knots such as Larks Head,Half knot, and square knot. And everything after that goes into a muchmore complicated area. In my opinion there are better books out there that are mucheasier to follow and I will continue my search for said book."
4,Good source.,Like that it is V-caps which make it more expensive for some reason. Good price compared to others I looked at.
3,not the best terranova...,"i have been a fan of terranova for a long time, but this album i wouldnt say disappointed me, no actually i would, it did disappoint me. i would still buy it again just so i could have all the terranova albums but i dont think i will listen to it that much.."
4,My Main Man...,"Louis Allen Rawls (December 1, 1933 - January 6, 2006) Rest in Peace my friend... You gave us many great moments. Perhaps Old Blue Eyes (Sinatra) said it best. Frank Sinatra once said that Rawls had ""the classiest singing and silkiest chops in the singing game""."
2,Breaks easily,"I have to repurchase these annually since the connection stub where the tubing attaches to the stake breaks every year. There aren't a lot of other alternatives so I put up with the hassle of reordering them every year. If there were better alternatives, I would certainly switch products."
5,From my letter to the author,"Hello, Dr. Roe,I just had to let you know how much I enjoyed your book! Ilove your ability to describe people, places and events.Being a cat person, I also really enjoyed the relationshipbetween Paul and Grey. I wanted to let you know how talented I think you are."
4,got to love the lyrics!!!!! Thanks Billy!,"The words to these songs are really great. All you have to do is listen and you'll get hooked too!!Who'd have thought that an Indian Head Penny could go so far in it's life!! and Wish You Were Here, will pull at your heartstrings."
2,Different presentation but the content is of little value.,"For each line of the hexagrams, the author gives the interpretation in 12 sections labeled as: Judgement, Emotion, Economy, Ambition, and so on. This is a NEW LOOK AT THE I CHING. The big problem is the interpretation for those 12 sections are not much helpful.For example, on page 51, for hexagram 11 line 2, his interpretations for Judgement is ""Continued decisiveness requires empathy, firmness, attention to detail and a committment not to abuse power""; for Economy is ""Continued economic stability requires prudence, planning, a lack of ostentation and generosity where is needed."""
5,"The best form of feelings, funk, harmony, and soul !","I FELL IN LOVE WITH AL GREEN THANKS TO THE INSPIRATION OF MY YOUNGER BROTHER. I ESPECIALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS LOVE SONGS. NO MATTER WHAT STATE OF MIND I'M IN OR WHERE I AM, IF AL GREEN COMES ON THE RADIO, I LITE UP!!! TILL THIS DAY, CERTAIN SONGS WILL MAKE ME CRY, LAUGH, OR SMILE. NEVER HAVE I FELT SUCH RAW EMOTION, AND FEELINGS OF JOY, THAN WHEN I LISTEN TO AL GREEN. THE WAY HE USES OCTAVES IS INCREDIBLE. IT'S AS IF HE'S SINGING TO YOU, OR DESCRIBING SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH. HIS ALBUM IS DEFINATELY GOING TO BE A MUST AT MY WEDDING."
3,great cd glad i purchased it listen to it all the time,"great choice of songs on cd some repeats of what i already have but good, listen to this cd all the time"
5,ONLY TWO OTHERS HAVE REVIEWED THIS ALBUM???,"""I'm Still in Love With You""...""Love and Happiness""...""For the Good Times""...""Look What You Done For Me""...""What a Wonderful Thing Love Is""...If this isn't a classic, then, I don't know what is. This is a definite must-have, spend-your-last-dime, and a go-to-the-head-of-the class-with-disc-in-hand purchase, even WITHOUT the two bonus tracks."
2,Will We Ever Receive A Truly Beautiful Release?,"I don't know....I have always held out on buying any Al Green releases due to sound issues. I'm Still In Love With You is my favorite record of Al's and truly deserves a ""treatment"". The vocals have a tinny/scratchy sound to them and it drives me insane. Please someone...give Al the proper release he deserves. One of the truly great southern soul singers of all time still waiting for a proper digital era release. I'm waiting."
5,The best Bible I have,I am a preacher and purchased this Bible because it is a KJV Loose Leaf version.Now I bind my Bible study and sermon notes as part of my Bible.Never be without your notes again!
5,Great for astronomy and low-light viewing,"It's not featherweight, but this binocular is fairly easy to hold up to your eyes for extended star-watching sessions. Does a great job of revealing deep-sky objects on a starry night, and it's also excellent for general, daytime use. Images are sharp and vivid with no distortion that I can see."
5,Quality Binos,For the money these are great binos . Nice case and neck strap included and Nikons no hassle warranty . image quality very good in low light .
2,Thumbs down,"Use caution when considering these PASSION PRODUCTIONS double feature DVDs. I bought their Jack Palance two-fer ofMISTER SCARFACE / COP IN BLUE JEANSand felt totally burned. The worst possible transfer quality, blurry image on both, weak audio on one of the two.The John Carradine movies here are about 30 years older. Doesn't bode well, but there's no way I'd take another chance with this outfit, anyway."
4,Summary WIR.,"Excellent. A must for military history buffs. Made up mainly of ""after action reports"" of this little known unit of black men. Free blacks and slaves purchased from the Caribbean island plantations made up these units. THey fought gallantly in many arenas of conflict, the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East. They even made it as far North as New Orleans in 1812. West indians fighting in the good old USA. Who knew."
4,Don't let it gather dust!,"Very few remember this great band-how unjust!Pablo Cruise were in the tradition of Santana,Eagles,Steely Dan,and in terms of musicianship they were equal to any of the above.Listen to this album with jazzy undertones and rediscover an unfairly forgotten band.They were masters of rythm and melody and,far from being dated,this music sounds as fresh today as it did in the late seventies."
4,"Overcoming the banality of evil, corruption in adoption","La Historia Official is a well-made film about awakening from passive complicity in evil, in this case, forced adoption. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo were and are an inspiration to those who struggle to uncover and resist abuses in adoption practices, be they the enslaved Irish women of the Magdalen laundries or the many indigenous peoples who had children forcibly removed from homes to be adopted by whites. Most of adoption does not involve abduction, but to turn a blind eye to the fact that it does exist, is to be passively complicit, as was the protagonist in this film.The scene in which the teacher realizes that tremendous evil has indeed been perpetrated, and that she may very well be the beneficiary of such evil, is staggering. Norma Aleandro is a talented enough actress that we believe her initial rejection of this revelation, and her gradual evolution from passive cohort to courageous seeker of the truth."
3,Forgettable and slow,"The Bottom Line:I salute this film for trying to uncover an awful chapter in Argentinian history, but it's so understated and slow for the majority of its running length that it never quite manages to qualify as entertainment; if you're interested in the subject you might want to check it out, but I think the average viewer will not come away thrilled.2.5/4"
2,"An very good movie, a bad DVD","This movie addressed a painful issue to many Argentinans, the dissapearances during the military regime. Aleandro's excellent acting, the films story, how it evolves, the tragedy behind the emotions, the tragedy of chosing between existing bliss and justice, and a touchy subject, is very much worthwhile viewing, and maintains actuality to this day, with the outstanding reconciliations of societies like Argentina and Chile with the dissapearences and genocide of people opposed to the dictatorships, or who simply had different points of view. It is a pity that the DVD images are not well reproduced, some work could have been done to improve them through existing technology, and I was shocked to see a DVD that reproduces the subtitle in the movie, and does not allow you to take the subtitles off. Studios have to think more globally and be less US centric, and give us, who speak several languages, the option to take off or put on the subtitles."
1,"Bought on Amazon, but not what they said it was!!","The information says 250 ft. There is no decimal in the information, but when it arrived it was 25 ft. only. I didn't need a 25 ft. cord."
2,Hang the original sound engineer!,"I really don't understand what the previous reviewer calls 'superb sound quality' or something. This is very much a bootleg recording, as regards the sound quality. In fact both concerts sound just like rubbish, which is a shame, because the first tracks are excellent. One can more or less guess that Mrs. Ayler, Peacock and Murray are playing at the top of their games. Listening to this album is just like walking in the mist. A shame, really."
2,Interesting But Not Informative,"In preparation for my trip, I found this DVD only interesting and not at all helpful in understanding or appreciating the Azores and Portugal. Don't buy it, try to find it at your local library."
1,Unhappy,"The CD was in poor condition - not good and certainly not Very Good, as advertised. It sticks in one place and the plastic box was cracked all the way across. It took over 4 weeks to arrive and was an ""international"" package that had to be signed for...so I won't order from this vendor again. ...The music was good Bob Wills though!"
2,Serious Audio problems detract from this film (VHS version),"This movie is more fantasy, and artsy dark fantasy at that, than a typical horror movie, which is something I like.However I can't comment on the movie itself too much, because I really just couldn't get passed the serious audio problems.The voices are quiet and have a rather muffled sound the majority of the time, and as a result I can understand very little of what was is said. The music some times is also way too loud.Thanks to the quiet muffled voices and loud music I found myself constantly turning the volume way up, and then way down.Makes me wonder if the DVD has subtitles, and/or has remastered audio, if so I may pick it up."
2,"Lovely concept, poor execution","The concept of lycanthropy as a metaphor for sexual initiation is an interesting one, full of implications to keep a graduate student writing for days on end. Unfortunately, this film fails to adapt the concept smoothly, and its jarring visuals (really, could we not find even a couple of wolves for shooting, instead of using Belgian sheepdogs?!) undermine its attempts at real art.In the end, I couldn't decide if the confused scripting was a comment on the conflicting and tangled mythology of sex presented to most adolescents, or if it were simply a conflicting and tangled screenplay. In the end, it failed to move me.With its intriguing premise, it should have been better than it was."
3,Freud's Fairy Tales,"This is a decidely freudian interpretation of classic fairy tales. Both implicitly and explicity, the story is immersed in sexuality; it defines the loss of virginity in terms of fear, horror and violence. Men are protrayed as predatory animals and savage beasts solely driven by lust, who must be killed before they violate their young maiden prey.This film boasts a talented director (Neil Jordan, who co-wrote the script) and cast (the beautiful young lead, Sarah Patterson, especially deserves praise) but suffers from a lack of focus regarding the plot structure and overall intent. It has a schizophrenic personality, never quite deciding whether it is a quality family film, an out-and-out horror flick or an adult exploration into sexuality. It never wholly succeeds on any of these levels."
1,Should have left it in the '80s,I guess I've been spoilt by great special effects in movies in the decades since this film was made but even that reasoning can not excuse the poor story-line - a jumble of dreams and realities (although I'm not sure there were any realities in it). I really wished I hadn't bought it because now I have a DVD I know I will never ever watch again and could never bring myself to recommend or pass on to anyone else.
3,Company of wolves,"The reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because I love the atmosphere it evokes, like little red riding hood meets tales from the dark side. If it were done with more budget in the effects area it would get 5 stars, but for an old school... It rocks:)"
4,DARK AND DISTURBING,"Neil Jordan's little-known werewolf film mixes several Grimm fairy tales (mainly ""Ltttle Riding Hood"" and ""The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf"") with a disturbing Freudian coming of age sexuality. Sarah Patterson is the hormonally driven lead facing puberty and predatory men. A dangerous mix. Angela Lansbury is startling as the story-telling grandmother. David Warner is the sympathetic woodsman dad. Weird, wonderful and genuinely horrifying."
3,"Visually Arresting, Pointedly Feminist Tale","I have mixed feelings about this film. It's visually stunning, with great art direction and cinematography plus some beautifully haunting soundtrack music. Yet the ""all men are pigs"" (or in this case wolves) message, thinly disguised as a fairy story, bothered me. If there were some balance here I'd give it a better rating, but the only counter-point to the general premise is when the mother tells the daughter that ""women have a dark side as well"", one brief line in an otherwise decidedly anti-male sentiment. The symbolism (for those who don't get it) was pretty clear to me: you see a male, then immediately a cut to a snake, or a frog, or a wolf, etc. (as when the young boy is pursuing the girl) and it's not hard to decipher the intention here."
3,Not very HD,"This release works great on American players, but be aware that the dark, gloomy and extremely foggy nature of the photography makes this a very flat presentation. It looks ok, certainly better than DVD, but it does not have the 3D pop you may be accustomed to on other Blu-ray releases."
3,The Company of Wolves,"Surreal, werewolf take on Red Riding Hood, some genuinely creepy moments, great transformations.Follow my Reviews on Twitter:http://twitter.com/TheJoyOfFilm"
4,"""My, What Big Teeth You Have!""","4 Stars = ClassicThis fantasy/horror film is loosely based on ""Little Red Riding Hood.""Dreamy, surrealism, enhanced by gorgeous photography, top notch acting, & a great script/story line, it is quite unlike any other Werewolf film I've seen. It has a way of getting under your skin!Sink your teeth, eyes, & ears into this one!"
5,A very unique film,"The Company of wolves is a very unique film that has to be watched with an open mind. It's a very surreal fantasy-horror story all of which takes place within the mind of a sleeping adolescent girl. Each story is filled with beautifully done metaphors and similes in which the werewolves represent puberty, sexuality, masculinity, and sexual awakening though there is no actual sex in the entire movie. It's very beautifully done. And even if you don't like symbolism and faery-tale style movies the werewolf transformations are quite unnerving and the stories the grandmother tells Rosaleen (which are acted out as short stories in the movie) are rather chilling. This is the most original werewolf movie you will ever come across. There has never been or will there ever be again anything quite like it."
4,"Granny is wolfy, too!","Elements of every fairy tale you've ever heard are woven into this quirky, masterful story of the wolves who are ""hairy on the inside"". Sexual themes (but not much violence) make this film unsuitable for children under 13, but you won't see too much nudity or explicit sex. It's highly symbolic.Little Red Riding Hood learns that Granny is much more than a helpless old lady, and the wolf is not so powerful that they can't defeat him. In fact, the wolves that run through the forest in this fantasy are much better than some of the people who hunt them down. You never know what's going to happen next. Some of the sequences seem out of place and apropos of nothing, but the film as a whole tells a basic moral story that can benefit our ailing society."
3,Good movie for the most part but...,"Most of this movie is very lush, beautifully photographed, and often quite poetic. What I don't like are two specific scenes that are just plain gross and could have been filmed very differently without reverting to such things. The first one, early in the film, is the worst. I for one am not entertained by gore and blood. These two scenes are totally out of place compared to the rest of the film. I believe in leaving some things to the imagination and being far more subtle. Things don't have to be so in your face. I hate the cover, the poster made to advertise this film. It appeals to the lowest common denominator of viewers."
4,Atmospheric visual and musical beauty beyond comparison...,"I was amazed when I first saw this film in the mid-1980s. This film captured my heart and touched on that fantasy world atmosphere I've envisioned since I was a child more so than any other film I've ever seen. The Company Of Wolves is a sort of glamourised, horrific telling of the tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The casting, the lighting, the camera angles, the beautiful dream world atmosphere, the special effects, and the old world-style of story telling is remarkable. This film has a passionate soul. Equally remarkable and integral is George Fenton's fantastic impressionist/romantic musical score to the film.If you are a fan of well-made, intelligent horror films, and/or of atmospheric fantasy films like, for example, ""Legend"", you'll simply fall in love with this buried and thoroughly underrated gem of a film by Neil Jordan."
2,"Great book - NOT FROM THIS PUBLISHER, THOUGH!!","I purchased this book in paperback - I can't comment on any other versions - and there are SO many spelling, punctuation and publishing errors it is almost impossible to read. There are sentences that just end at the end of the line. We began to mark them and found oftentimes more than 15 errors per page. This book was obviously not proofread or there were errors in the final publishing. This review isn't against the book - it's a wonderful story. But against the publisher - General Books, LLC. Please ensure that you get an edition NOT from this publisher."
3,a respectably good read,"This book is a good but very light read. The plot is not complex - it is more like a series of vignettes. The author is perhaps a little over-enamoured with her setting; there is a lot of detailed description of scenery. Also watch for some mild, period-specific racial stereotyping. Overall, perhaps not exactly a gripping page-turner but a good read when you don't want anything too stressful."
1,Bad proof reading...,I am a big fan of Susan Coolidge books and own the other books in the same series. This is the first time I bought a book from this publisher and I was so annoyed with all the typos and bad print in this book. It totally spoilt the book for me. I would not buy from this publisher again
2,Canto Di Primavera,"The album's title sounds somewhat like a veal entree in an Italian ristorante, the contents is quite close to it too. Some instrumental passages are reminiscent of the group's early years and suggest that the former mastery is hiding behind the mediocrity of the music. A couple of exuberant songs (the title track inclusive) are variations on themes of a little shepherd girls' choir, the rest is outright boring, best when used for an acupuncture session, highly recommended for the occasion."
2,the cheesiest of cheesy 80's music,Painful to listen to. I recommend it only for seriously masochistic individuals or farm animals. Probably used by the East German secret police in their heyday as a means of torturing political prisoners.
5,Nick Park is Extraordinary,"If you've never seen Nick Park's original Wallace & Gromit movies, you're missing the best claymation ever created. If you've only seen Chicken Run, you're missing the ""roots"" of Nick Park. The original movies are each about 30 minutes long, so they're perfect for little people. But big people will be just as entertained, intrigued by the intricacies of the characters, the scenes, and the storylines. A must have set for sure..."
2,Burned! Don't Over-Pay For This Book!,"It's not a BAD book. Perhaps I should have done more research. It's out of print so the ""New"" prices are quite high as you can see. I thought I scored by picking up a used one for around $26. Not so much. The original list price was $12.95. For that, it's not so bad. There's very little text and the photos are abundant but not terribly impressive. The vintage pictures of the Connie in commercial service are basically not-terribly-good reproductions of the famous shots we've all seen before. (i.e. the cover shot). The rest are photos that presumably the author took himself fairly recently of restored / derelict Connies at Pima and other places. Also, there's an over-concentration, (in my opinion), on military variants, possibly because of the availability of photo subjects. Like I said above, it's not at all a bad book, but I certainly wouldn't pay more than fifteen bucks for it if I had it to do over again."
3,Lockheed Constellation,"There are several excellent books written about the iconic Lockheed Constellation, but unfortunately this is not one of the better ones. It does have excellent photographs -- some that are rarely seen -- but the text is disjointed and not well-organized. The book is not bad or inaccurate by any means, but there are numerous other books that cover the topic more thoroughly; fortunately, there are many publications on this most-famous aircraft."
1,Buyer beware--Item not as described,"This item looked like a great deal, so I ordered one package and it arrived a little over a week later. However the five microfiber dishcloths I received are not what Amazon said they would be. The description says they are 12"" by 24"" in size. The ones Amazon sent me are each 11"" by 11"". The price is roughly ""half off,"" but you get half the product."
3,Nice but they do start to smell,I was trying to find a dishcloth that did not get that musty smell. These worked great for about a month and then the smell started in. I still recommend these because they dry faster and wash very well. But don't purchase them because you think they won't smell.
2,"Hmm, they do smell","I bought these based on the other reviews & I have to say these do smell even when dry. I do rinse them out & wring them well & they still smell. I went away for a week & came back & the entire house smelled awful from that one cloth! Also, the first time I washed them the edging started falling apart."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"Falling apart after just a couple of days light-duty use wiping up water on the kitchen counter, followed by a gentle round in the washing machine. Hems unraveling, holes mid-towel, frays, fading - you name it.What I want to know is how anyone could give these things 4 or 5 stars?Save yourself the aggravation and avoid these tissue-quality towels."
5,these hold up extremely well,"I don't like to use a sponge for washing dishes. The microfiber dishcloth is a great option. From my previous experience, I expect these to hold up for a very long time."
4,so far so good,"So far I have been very happy with my new dishcloths. It seems like no matter what I do microfiber dishcloths get stinky so much faster. However, I have not had that problem with these dishcloths. They have a nice soft texture which I really like as well. The only thing I would change, although it really is not a big deal, is that if I wipe up something with a bright color like spaghetti sauce it is hard to get the color to rinse out."
5,unholy vomiting zombies,"For those of you that just can't get enough of the Misfits or Tiger Army or any of the other amazing horror based groups out there, this is THE album you must hear. Calabrese puts it together like it should be, zombies, hearses, and a bucket of blood. 13 Halloweens should be on the shelves of every music store in America. Truly amazing work.J. Allen Wretched"
1,LONG and NEVER ending,I tried and tried to finish these awful stories but they dragged on and on-Was there ever an END ? If you want to read a good Fairy/Elf story check out the author Jodie Forrest.....
3,It's cool!,Roddy Mcdowall playing a guy with lots of issues is funny. Some of the songs are memorable. The leading man is a little stiff. But the plot is simple and its a fun return to the rock and roll of the 60s. If you don't think to hard its a nice film.
1,Not a good learning resource,"I am a true beginner, and when I started listening to this course I liked it. It is structured for simple vocabulary building (words/phrases in English followed by Italian translation). But even to me it was clear that Italian speaker in not native. As I listened to other audio classes, I questioned pronunciation, and confirmed with my Italian teacher, that a lot of words on this CD are mispronounced(the rest of reivews seem to agree), and some are presented in wrong content. Unless you are ready to double-check every word you learn, stay away from this course."
2,Italian lessons,"For me this was very hard to understand. A guy says something then a woman voice repeats it in Italian. After listening to the first section several times I realized that I was doing it backwards---I thought the lady was going first then they guy until I heard a word I knew and realized it was completely wrong so the guy must be going first. Anyway, there has to be a better way to learn Italian, plus the woman's voice gets really annoying after awhile."
3,Porn with a pretty cover!,"I have long been obsessed with Marie Antoinette. I am, in fact, writing a book set in the court of Louis XVI. You can imagine my delight when I was informed about the pending release of Ms. Thomas's book. I had hoped her book would provide many examples of libel against the queen. I was hoping this book would detail who wrote what and when. I found this book to be an excuse to print a lot of nasty words. Ms. Thomas's views, while educated, were tired and repeated over and over again. Nothing in this book was thought-provoking or fresh. It did not illuminate or entertain. Very little was devoted to the effects of the words against the queen. How did this effect MA emotionally, physically? What did it do to the marriage of the King and Queen? What were the long-term impacts of these libelous ditty's? How did they effect journalism as we know it today? How did they contribute to the Revolution? All in all, a disappointment."
2,An amateurish account,"This book was a disappointment. I ...was very interested. I am a 'fan' of Marie Antoinette and have been fascinated with her life since reading Castelot's biography of her.This book however, though it has some interesting pamphlets of historical interest, is more like a scrapbook. The writing is poor and has no direction. The pamphlets reproduced in the book are mostly pornographic lyrics and droll poetry of the Queen. The worst of which is Marie Antoinette riding an erected penis as if it were an ostrich.If you want to learn about the Queen, her children, or the French Revolution, this is not the book to find it in. If you are very familiar with the Queen's life, this may offer you a little insight as to the people's attitude at the time, but that's it. I read it once, and it has been on the shelf since.For a truly amazing book about Marie Antoinette, I suggest 'The Fatal Friendship'."
1,Terrible,"I'm used to reading dry academic articles on fascinating subjects, but I unlike other reviewers, I can't say this was particularly dry. It's just badly written. There are infinite grammatical errors ranging from missing periods, to sentences that switch directions in the middle of reading them, to an appalling lack of editing (ever heard of a thing called a comma?). Usually I can get my head around complex sentence structures, but Haynes' writing is a joke. Where was his editor in all of this?I'd say don't bother with this book, even if you're willing to slog through the pedantic and error-filled paragraphs. His minimal use of documentation and his embarrassing lack of understanding of Shakespeare, on whom he relies hugely to outline his concepts, will just madden the serious researcher and confuse the casual reader. I can't believe I picked this up at the Museum of London... Their publications are usually far superior to this tripe. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,"Somewhat dry, but interesting details.","I found the book to be knowledgable and thorough, but extremely dry and hard to read. I could not believe that someone could make a subject like this so dry. ...P>That said, you won't find too many straightforward sources like this, and it's got some neat photos and portrait reproductions that make the book worth getting. The information contained herein isn't particularly suited to children, but it isn't shocking or titillating. It reads more like a lecture by a very prim history prof. Anybody of any morals should be able to digest this without dying of offensensitivity."
2,My reviews of this book are not being published,"I have already written two reviews of this book, the latest of which was written on Februarty 16th 2003. None of these has been published. Is there something going on that I should know about?"
3,HELLO STRANGER,"This is why I purchased this cd. Use to have the ""45"" of it, but it disappeared...Can't say much for the rest of the songs. But getting this song was worth the price, and deleting most when I put it on my pc."
3,A Tad Noisy,"Fan moves air around well, was very easy to assemble. My only complaint is the noise. On speed #2, the case face rattles. On speeds 3 & 4, the fan runs extremely loud to where I have to turn up the TV sound to hear over it. And definitely can't sleep through it. Most nights I wake up in the middle of the night to turn it down or off because it interrupts my sleep. As a fan, it does its job (pushing air around) but I wish it was quieter."
3,An ok fan...once you put it together,"Probably the most important thing to note about this fan is that is it NOT assembled. The assembly instructions are virtually unreadable, and I had to have 2 people help me put it together.However once you put away your screwdriver, it's ok. It's sitting on my desk right now. At least it is pretty quiet, which was the main reason I was buying a new fan."
4,"took 3 days to ship, box damaged when arrived","the fan itself is fine and works well....no troubles there.....it took 3 days before it shipped and the box was all beat up. The fan inside was fine, but shame on them for shipping something like thisthey lose a star because of that"
1,junk,Right out of the box I knew this product was junk. Bolts on it were rusted and the fan blade had some sort of brown crap on it. Put it all together and plugged it in only to find out the thing didn't even work! Not so much as a hum came out of it...buyer be ware. This is some China made junk at its finest....buy American.
1,JUNK!,"These fans are junk. Poor quality plastic, do not assemble easily, are not eqipped with anti-skid feet,and are not very powerful when compared to older Lasko or Galaxy 12"" fans. Amazon would do well to carry higher quqlity fans, as carrying one poor quality item makes customers question Amazon's commitment to providing quality items to it's customers."
3,Lasted only one year,"Fan worked just fine but...it lasted only ONE year. Oiled it, it worked again for a month. Now it's just plain dead. For $32 you would think it would last longer."
2,"Poorly made - Died after 3 months, cover didn't fit.","When the fan arrived, I tried for an hour to get the cover put together. No dice. Since I don't have small children, I just left the cover off. The fan motor died after 3 months. It's very noisy, too. I had it sitting on the top of my desk, and every time I adjusted it down to blow on me, it would pop right back up. Simply put, it was garbage that didn't last long enough for the money."
5,great book,My son loves this book. This is a great beginner book for children that love playing baseball. It is pretty simple works for the kids too.
1,But a hearing aid or don't waste your money,"This could have been an excellent addition to my collection, but the sound quality is lousy. You have to blast your stereo to hear the songs and then they are barely audible. Too bad."
1,Horrible Sound/Great Choices,Stay away from this particular CD of Petula. The pressing is simply horrible. You would do much better picking another company's pressing of Petula's songs. . . .
1,Bad sound,"I concur with everyone (except the person from Jersey who apparently likes CD's that sound two steps removed from 8-track cartridges) that the sound quality on this disc is wretched. For the longest time, this was the only Pet Clark collection available, and the only one without remakes. As such, it filled a void and did the world a service. But CD mastering technology has grown by leaps and bounds since 1986, and newer collections use first generation tapes and the sound explodes from the speakers. ""The Ultimate Petula Clark"" has more tracks (21) for about the same price."
4,Great!,This is a wonderful cd for someone who dosn't have any Petula Clark music and wants to buy some. Its got some of her best hits. I highly recommend it.
1,Horrible sound quality,"This CD's sound quality is horrendous! It's too bad because the selection of songs is very good. Unfortunately, you can hardly make out any of them. Save your money and buy one of her CD's that has been properly remastered."
2,NOT AS GOOD QUALITY AS THE BMG & SANCTUARY/CASTLE RELEASES,"Both the packaging and the sound quality on this GNP/Crescendo compilation of Petula Clark's original 1960s hits are inferior -- the mastering is not crisp and is too low, the artwork is poor and has incorrect and incomplete credits, plus some key hits are missing (such as ""Round Every Corner"" and Petula's self-penned ""You're The One"" among others). The U.S. BMG ""Ultimate Petula Clark"" CD is much superior in song selection (20 tracks), sound quality (top-notch) and artwork (beautiful pictures and informative liner notes. The double disc ""Petula Clark Anthology: Downtown To Sunset Boulevard"" on Hip-O/Universal is even more comprehensive for those who wants to hear Clark's wonderful recordings of the 1970s-1990s and movie and stage songs. But this Crescendo ""Greatest hits of Petula Clark"" should be avoided."
5,Petula Clark has a golden voice,I love the songs of Petula Clark and her Greatest Hits CD is wonderful. All the songs you remember from years ago sound the same and her voice is just darling. I highly recommend this CD if you love the sounds of Petula Clark. She has a beautiful voice and one that can rock you to sleep.
4,---Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose Any minute now I'm expecting' all hell to break loose...,"...People are crazy and times are strange I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range I used to care but - things have changed. -- Bob DylanOne of the best movies about writers and writing I've seen, ""Wonder Boys"" is centered around Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas in one of his most enjoyable performances), the college professor and the author of one very good book who has written over 2000 pages of his eagerly expected (at least by his impatient editor, Robert Downy, Jr - where is this guy?) second book but still is not sure when and how it ends. During one strange weekend, Grady would have to deal with his wife leaving him, his married girlfriend's pregnancy, the stolen Marylyn Monroe's priced jacket, a dead dog in his car's trunk, his obviously very talented but troubled student, and the most serious question of all - to write or not to write? ...Oh, and there is also that song by Bob Dylan!"
4,RIVETING......,"The concept is totally progressive and intriguing while you get totally drawn into this wildly insane and intense ""game of life"" For anyone who wants some excitement for a couple of hours! But beware, it will stick in your brain - - this could very well be the future........"
3,Good Rutger Hauer+Mimi Rogers combo.,"Good science fiction, with a novel twist (prisoners are kept together by explosive neck-braces that will explode if they are seperated more than 100 yards) is nearly done in by mediocre production values and a plot that nearly deteriorates near the end. The love story is pretty pale too, though Hauer and Rogers make it worth seeing."
5,No prison can hold Rutger,"Modern prison of the future... Prison with no fences and yet no one escaped from there. In this prison convicts are guards to each others, and lethal collars are preventing them to run away. Add Rutger Hauer as main star and we have a big shot! A lot of action, fun and Rutger's cold humor. Plus, he has lovely Mimi Rogers as wedlock partner and what more do you need?! This is TV movie but it is very good, a lot better than many new films that we can see in theaters these days."
5,My Reveiw of Romeo and Juliet,I thought Shakespare made a great play beacause it was good in all ways and it left you wondering what was going to happen next!! It was sad at the end that Romeo killed himself for juliet and juliet killed herself for romeo but they were in love and the could't bare to stay away from each other ! They were teens in love ! I like the book alot ! Romeo did not care what people thought about him just that he was in love with juliet . This book kept me interested in every part of it ! Shakespare made a good play fro everyone to share and i am glad that i got to read Romeo and Juliet
4,"Ahh, Young Love","Picture this: the starlit balcony, Juliet gazing longingly up at the night sky, speaking those famous words as Romeo watches from below. You can practically hear the strings swelling as they embrace for that immortal kiss...But as romantic and unabashedly poetic as this story is, I'm afraid it doesn't hold a candle to its more ""grown-up"" brother and sister tragedies. It does make for a nice read though, especially for young people."
4,Romeo and Juliet,The book Romeo and Juliet was extraordinary because William Shakespeare described love and hate in the same book.The character that reflected me most was Tybalt because he had an abundance of hatred for the Montagues.Then commited suicide out of love for each other
5,gift,"This was a gift for my granddaughter, so i can't rate it personally..Although she has been interested in reading this for sometime,,she likes the idea that she can read the Elizabethan and the version she understands"
4,Got him interested!!,"I bought this for an independent study assignment for my 16 year old grandson. The assignment was to read it and to create a daily written diary as if you were one of the characters. The book he started with was simply the original poetry, and he really struggled. Once we got this version, he used the plain English side of the pages to read the story, and was able to understand what was happening. While writing the diary pages, he used the plain English side to find his place, to re-read and understand, but he used the poetry side to obtain quotes for his characters. The result was an ""A"" on an assignment that he had initially felt he simply couldn't do. We will use this series of books again."
4,Good learning tool,My 14-year old is studying Shakespeare in his English class and his teacher recommended this book. My son enjoys it because each page has both the original Shakesperean text and the modern-day English. He has related to me some interesting parallels between the two.
3,Romeo & Juliet,"I think that the book of Romeo & Juliet is a good book. For me is interesting because it shows the strong love that Romeo and Juliet had between each other. It is a tragedy because they are separated by the feud of their families the Capulets and the Montagues. I think this isn't a 5 stars book because it is to poetic, what I mean is that they use poetic expressions too much during the book.I liked very much the poetic expression, but in the book there are too many so in a certain moment you get tired of them. This makes to interrupted the book. The book is a tragedy but it is too tragic indeed, what I mean is that it doesn't have anything happy, everyone dies! It looks like a massacre. This makes Romeo & Juliet a 3 stars qualified book."
3,romeo and juliet,i thought this book was pretty good..it was kind of complicated....but it was good.. the easy text side by side with the old text is the thing that kind of confused i didnt realize nothing untill after a couple chapters i was wondering why i kept rreading stuff over and over againalrato
2,Study can be fun!,"Your assignment is to read Romeo and Juliet. But who can understand that crazy ancient style of writing? So here you are, hoping for an easier way to get through this, with a side by side translation into simple English. Easier? Maybe. Still boring? Definitely. A dry translation of each line into its literal dictionary meaning makes for awkward, stilted prose and dull reading. These side-by-sides are all the same - except for one:William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Uncensored. Whatever it is, this one is definitely not boring. It's a different take which is not afraid to bring out all the sexiness of the tale that is hidden between the lines. You'll understand this play even more fully (more fully then your teacher intended) and be wonderfully entertained at the same time."
2,Don't buy this boxed-set!,"The reason why I'm saying this is because Austin Powers III will be on arriving at cinemas in just a few months. Now, ofcourse, APIII will also be released on DVD, and you don't wanna spend your money on this boxed-set when you can get the whole trilogy, do you? Universal did the same thing! They released a boxed-set with Jurassic Park/The Lost World, and eveybody just went ""WOW!"" And then, just a few months later, they released the trilogy!Don't fall into New Lines trap! Wait for the trilogy!"
1,Been 2 months and Amazon hasn't shipped,I ordered in January and now it's March and all Amazon does is blame their supplyer. The postponed the delivery date for two weeks but that time has passed and it still hasn't shipped. Customer service said that it's against their policy to do anyting about it. I don't know why they keep this product on their site if they can't deliver. Very poor service.
4,MLK?,"Never heard of them before, a DJ friend of mine turned me on to them. Their re-mixed cuts are dangerous; case in point check out the bass heavy reggae flavoured ""My Woman"" Featuring Soy Sauce. Verdict? Dan-do-Mite!!! Nuff said."
5,I LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOO MUCH,"THE ALBUM IS A CLASSIC SHEIS THE MOTHER OF NEO-SOULSHE CAME BEFORE ERYKAH,JILLAND MANY OTHERS WITH NO SUCCESS, JOIHAS BEEN MISTREATED BY THE INDUSTRY AND IT'S ADAMN SHAME,GO COP THIS ALBUMIT IS THE SH*T."
4,Great Album,"I was looking for this album for the past 5 years!!! I am so glad that I was able to purchase this album thru Amazon.com AND the CD was in EXCELLENT condition! My favorite track off the album is ""Memories""! I would recommend this album to anyone who is a Joi fan!"
5,Water Rinsable,This filter can be cleaned by rinsing with water. This is better than simply tapping or air blowing.
2,Smells funny,"Fits fine seems to work fine, but the exhaust air smells like mothballs. I have only run the vacuum for about 20 minutes since installing this filter, so I hope it will settle down. Probably should have returned it and bought the standard version."
2,Disappointing,"Much less information in this biography than given in one published in an edition of 'Contemporary Authors' I read in the late 1990s in the public library. Anton Myrer is far and away my favorite author of all time. He was a gifted individual whose talent and reputation has been given far less credit than he deserved to receive. This may be due to what appears to have been a very modest and private nature on his part. Which only adds to my admiration of this wonderful writer and human being.Also, I noticed an error. In many other biographies I have read, Mr. Myrer's death is given as January 19, 1996."
5,Tremendous Bass CD,This CD goes to all of you out there who have subwoofers. The bass in this CD is so abundant. You won't need another bass CD after you listen to this one. I encourage you to buy it if you love bass or techno etc.
4,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"The book was about a young farm boy who had to learn to take the responsibility of being a man. Robert is a 12-year-old whose life is doing chores and going to school. He lives on a farm where he has nothing but his pig pinky, no friends to come and play. Robert has to learn to become a man, tend his father's farm, and take care of his mother and aunt, all at the age of 13.I think this was a very powerful book. If you are not touched in anyway by this book I'm sorry."
2,This a boring book,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is about a 13-year old boy who saves a cow and gets a piglet in return. The best part of the book is when Rob goes to Rutland Fair and struggles to see a pervert. This part of the book gives the story line good humor and laughs. I thought it needed more action, or comedy to make it better. This book might be good for Elementary Schools but not for Middle School students who are more mature than this.I do not recommend this to mature kids who enjoy humor and action."
2,Not The Worst Book But I Wouldn't Recommend It,"I thought the book ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" by Robert Newton Peck was mediocre. The book practically put me to sleep and if I wasn't forced to read it I wouldn't have. The characters were very boring and there was too much conversation. There was a lot of blood and gore in this book such as when the characters slaughtered Pinky. ""His privates were alert and ready too breed her"". This quote was about two pigs breeding and I think this part was unnecessary. On the plus side, this book did have a few humorous parts. An example is, when Rob goes to a fair and doesn't know what a pervert is, so he tries to find one. The book ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" was not the worst book I've ever read, but it surely wasn't the greatest. Because the subject of the book was definitely not something I'm interested in, I probably would not recommend it to any of my friends. Two Stars."
1,A Day No Books Should Sell,"I disliked the book A Day No Pigs would die because of the extremely slow pace. The content was boring. This book is definetly not appropriate for high school readers. Also, the book is not right for those who like books a little deeper and challenging to read. Parts of the plot disgust me. Overall this book is good only for those who read at an extremely low level."
1,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" is about a 13 year old boy, Robert, who lives with his parents and aunt. They live in Learning, Vermont in a farm. In the book, Robert recieves a pig as a pet and he takes care of his pig, Pinky, as if she is his own blood. They become the best of friends. Robert also builds a friendship with his dad.Although this book was touching, it was also extremely disgusting. I personally did not like this book very much because of so much animal cruelty and it was such an easy book. As a 9th grader, I think this book should not be assigned for reading because it's point less and not challenging at all."
1,Waste Of Paper and Time,"I think this book is a very bad book. It in no way what so ever interests me. Some of the scenes are down right disgusting. I don't recommend this, in fact I hope no body else reads this book for they're own sake. This book has stomach-turning scenes and is no age groups should read this. Some of these gruesome scenes are when Samson is trying to breed Pinky. It goes into great detail saying ""the blood ran down her leg"" and other phrases you may never want to hear. The book was very slow-paced and what I have learned from this book I will never use in my entire lifetime. The book was slow paced because it never really got interesting and it wasn't something you always felt like reading and hated when it ended. I hope this review has helped you in choosing to read this book or not."
3,"Review on ""A Day No Pigs Would Die""","""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" by Robert Newton Peck is a great book. The lessons in the book are easy to relate to. For example, Robert deals with death and birth. These lessons are easy to relate to because we experience these in everyday life. Robert also deals alot with responsitility at a young age. For example, at the end of the novel, Robert is thirteen and becomes a man. This shows that Robert learns a lot of responsibility and that we can relate to that in many ways. That is why ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" is a great novel."
1,The only book I have ever thrown away,"This book was fraught with inaccuracies (who has ever heard of a Shaker family? they're celibate!) and gruesome scenes, starting in the first chapter. I usually donate children's books to the library after I have read them, but this one I tossed in the trash."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"I had to read this book for school and I hated it! Unfourtonately, I had to give it one star. The book was very annoying with the bad grammar and all the bad content. There was no reason for all the graphic content. I couldn't make it through the last two chapters without crying and cringing. It was a terrible book. I still don't see why the father died and why they had to kill the pig. On the back of the book it says- ""Reading this book is like sipping hot cider in front of a crackling potbellied stove. Every page is suffused with wit and charm and glowing with warmth."" Whoever wrote this must hate sitting in front of a crackling fire sipping hot cider because this was the WORST BOOK EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!! My teacher made us read this. I would have never picked this up if I were reading on my own. I like to read, and this made me re-think my love of reading."
1,numerous descriptions of gross violent scenes,"The description and remarks on the back of the paperback book I read lead me to think I was about to read a wonderful coming of age book that was ""glowing with warmth"". I found this book anthing but that. It has graphic violent descriptions that add nothing to the factually weak story of a so called ""Shaker family"". I would never recommend this book to anyone. As an adult I found it disturbing-as a parent of a young avid reader I am now even more aware of not judging a book by its cover or at least the words on the cover!"
2,Very Boring and Very Depressing,"Peck's A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE was extremely boring at first, and wasn't very enjoyable. It was very depressing and it seemed absolutely pointless after a while. Can't the author even make up names???? And everything had the simple excuse, ""You're a man."" If anything sad happened, it was because you were a man. Very boring and very depressing, I give it 2 stars because it shows you how bad your life COULD BE and the struggle of it if you haven't experienced it."
2,I thought it was a good book except the death of Pinky,"I was reading this book for school, and I came to the part of slaughtering the pet pig, Pinky.I read this part and I feel that it was too descriptive and now it is causing me to have some thoughts about being a vegeterian.The story was interesting to learn about the Shakers' way of life, and although I do understand that slaughtering animals puts food on the table, I still think that that particular description could have been more left to the readers imagination. Why did the Author name the book ""A Day No Pigs Would Die,"" with a virtual blow-by-blow description of the slaughter itself?"
2,It is a extermely boring and dull book.,I don't recommend this book to others. This book starts very fast past and then winds down. At first the language that it is spoken in is extermely hard to understand. It opens as the boy skips school and is wandering and finds his neighbors cow about to give birth. Then he sees that she is having problems and tries to help her. If want your sanity don't read it. I am only reading this book because it is a school assignment. Give this book two stars is being very generous.
2,It is about Robert Peck's jouney into manhood.,This book is an interesting book explaining about many births and deaths that happen in a short period of a person's life. There are too many graphic details that I didn't ejoy reading about and it was very sad. There were some comical aspects of this book too that I did enjoy. Overall is was a good book only is you enjoy reading about very detailed real life situtations.
2,The book lacks depth and adequate elaboration.,"A Day No Pigs Would Die is not elaborate on the correct areas in the book and lacks depth which causes the story to lose its appeal to readers. Though the story involoves details that may be alluring to the audience it is not placed in the right context. Despite the apprasial by other readers, I feel as though this novel is one that can be abnegated from your reading list."
4,"capitvating! leave you speech less! kind of gross,though","Robert Peck is a great author that deserves all the recognition in the world! Robert tells an amazing tell of life as a young Shaker boy. He deals with many hardships and grows up within a season. It's remarkable how Robert describes what he went through when he was a little boy.Robert Peck may have had a boring childhood, but it was intersecting to some other people."
3,I thought it was an excellant book wich I would love reading,"The book ""A Day NO Pigs Would Die"" is an excellant book to read. If I had the time I would read it again and again.It also has taught me many valuable lessons.One thing I dislike about this book is some of the graphic things described. Mainly the birth of the calves. Other than that I think it is a great book."
3,Good book to read.,This book is about a shaker boy growing up in rural Vermont. He helped out a neighbor who gave him a pig in return. Sometimes the book is funny and other times it's kind of gross. THis is a good book to read to get a better idea of life as aShaker kid growing up in Vermont in the 1920's.
3,A day no pigs would die. =\,"In my 9th grade english class i choose to read this book. The book is about a young boy (robert) who lives on a farm. He gets a present of a piglet from his neighboor. The piglet and him become very good friends, and the book in most is about the developing bond between Robert and his piglet and his father. He becomes great friends with his piglet. During the winter, his familys supplies run out and they must kill pinky(the piglet) for food. I thought that, that was an interesting twist. When i started reading it I thought the pig would die in some freakish accident.The book to me was alright, but i wouldnt read it again"
4,This Beef Is About Pork.,"Characters in conflict is what moves a story along. The conflict, or ""beef,"" in this book is about a young boy's pet pig. The story develops this way:Boy saves neighbor's calf. Grateful neighbor gifts boy a piglet. Boy makes pet of pig. Boy's strict father frowns on gift. Boy's father butchers pigs for a living. Now that's conflict.This somber, touching book describes Shaker farm life in New England, and provides an excellent exploration of the relationship between father and son. Its apparent beef may be about pork, but underlying that is a sophisticated coming-of-age essay. Definitely worth a look. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."
3,Robert Peck grows up a little faster then expected.,"In the novel ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" is a heart-warming story about a young boy-Robert Peck trying to gain his father respect. All of his life he never really sees what his father's life is all about. Robert is faced with many problems that change her life forever! (The loss of his best friend...Pinky, his father passes away, and he goes through emtional changes)If you read this novel you gain more then just a wonderful story, but you get a wonderful outlook on life. You learn to make every day count."
3,An intresting book that was very emotional in different ways,"The book starts off with an unimaginable experience that happens to the main character. He explains the events that happen to him over a period of time, and talks about how he goes through so much with his family and the farm."
5,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"we gave this book 5 star's because it is a good book to read. It is very exciting, funny, and sad at times and once you start to read it you just want to keep on going and you can't stop."
4,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"We gave the book ****'s because it pulls you into the book with the literature and the way it's set up. The author uses many descriptive words and makes you want to read more.If you like sad, educational, and exciting books then you should definitely read ""A Day No Pigs Would Die""."
4,Excellent!,I thought that this book was fantastic but at some parts it was hard to understand the book. Other than that the book was 4 Stars!
5,Peck at his best.,"I love this book. It is a book that you could read again and again, and every time you will find a different moral."
5,Whoa.,"This book is one of those 'you laugh, you cry' books. When I first read it, I finished it at school. I had to leave the room because I was going to cry! It's that good. At some parts you laugh at Rob's confusion with the world around him, and at other parts, you cry with him through his suffering. This is an incredible story. Rob and Haven Peck will make an impact on your life."
1,Poor choice for any reading.,"Dear Parents,The book A day No Pigs Shall Die should not be on any reading list. I do not recommend it. I mean to the point that when child #2 was supposed to read that book at her Christian school; I said I would take her out of class for that section and she could flunk.This book is a nightmare maker. Child #1 (My oldest daughter) read the book and I was shocked that any school would have it on any reading list. Especially a Christian school! It is a cheap attempt to get middle school boys to show emotion. It flat out wrongly depicts Shaker life and faith, chronicles an adulterous affair and graphically retells the slaughter of a loved pet. Let alone the rape scene. This was the authors first book and he did everything to get the ""Worldly"" Critical Acclaim.Parents, guard the minds of your children. Why put this rubbish in their memories when there are other choices out there?"
2,Horrible and Gruesome!,"I Totally Hated this book,me, being in 7th grade, feels that this book is not sutable for any one younger then the age of 14. After reading this book, I just though of how discusting it was! I hated it,I cryed most of the book. This book should not be for children of ONLY the 7th grade.It is deffinetly something that is true, but they were to graphic and some parts they just went a little over board! dont you think?!?!"
4,I read this book in 6th grade and I really enjoyed it .,"For some one who doesn't like to read, this book wasn't bad at all. I liked the way it got more vivid and more interesting as you read further to the end. Personally, I like horror or comedy books and even though this one was sad it was still a book I will always remember. It really shows how easily pleased and upset children can be. Being a teenager myself, I can picture myslef in the little boys place and I think I would act the way he did in certain situations. I would recomend this book to any animal lover of any age. I think this book shows people that a human's connection and love with any animal is irreplacable."
3,"This Book is Slow, But Interesting","A Day No Pigs Would Die is a good book. The only reason I didn't really like it was because it was a little slow to get in to. I think the author did a good job portraying the characters, like papa and Rob. I think that as the book went along you really got to know the characters better. Some of the events were really funny, but some were really gross. One reason I gave it 3-stars was because it was very graphic at times and the author gave some very disturbing descriptions. It was mainly about the life of a poor Shaker boy who is very close to his pig. That is not really the kind of book I like because I'm not into books where a kid plays with his pig, but I did think the author did a good job writing the book. The book was overall a good book to read but it wasn't great. I think you should read this book if you're not reading anything at the present time."
2,Read with an open mind,"Reader: AGJ from MarylandThe book, A Day No Pigs Would Die, is only a so-so book. Robert Peck, the author, fails to expand on character and leaves much to be desired when it comes to plot. There is no particular plot. Peck just seems to randomly stick chapters in the novel. Most of the characters are under developed. Apart from Rob, the pig and his father are the only characters. The book was needlessly violent and graphic. Many animals fall victim to the author's violent tendencies. However, the author does get his point across. "" Hear me God...it's hell to be poor.""(p.134) The point is: growing up is tough on everybody. My point is: this book is not for everybody. Happy reading!"
2,A Day no Pigs Would Die,"We gave the book ""A Day no Pigs Would Die"" two stars because it's really hard to follow, because of all the old fasion terminology. In some places it was funny, such as when Pinky wassearching for frogs, and a crawfish pinched Pinky on the snout and Rob had to pull it off and fling it back in to the stream. Some parts were pretty gruesome, but in the end, something would happen and everything would be OK."
1,A book no kids would read,"After reading this book i feel drained. This book has no plot. The entire story is baout a Shaker boy who has a pet pig and a strict upbringing. I did not want to continue reading but i did.....unfortunately. It is very boring...and i would consider it a punishment for any child who is misbehaven. If you read the quotes on the back you will find that unless you own a potbellied stove or are sipping hot cider....you will not enjoy this book. Take my advice and save yourself the pain of reading this incredibly plotless, endless, boring book."
1,Still Haunts Me,"I was required to read this in the sixth or seventh grade and parts of it still haunt me now, twenty or so years later. I more or less quit eating meat based in part on the slaughter scene. I wish I'd never have read it. I'm know I'm more sensitive than most when it comes to such things, and I struggle with that now, being married to a farmer who also raises cattle. Some things are a part of life. This book should not be one of them."
2,Way too much detail,"Frankly, I think the details about the pigs breeding was more than I wanted to know and more than I want my 14 year old daughter to read. I'm surprised this is required reading in a Catholic school."
4,"This was a very good, emotional book.",This was a very good book. It had very powerful emotions and used nature very well to tell a beautiful story. All of the characters are very interesting and even the smallest characters play integral parts to the story.
2,We didn't like the book at all.,"We didn't like the book because it was disgusting, we couldn't relate to it, and the cow bit."
3,Who is this book for?,"The first chapter in the book was very fuuny and I liked that. I wish it would last thruogh the book, at least once and a while. Instead it has animals and people dying all the time. I wished that some of them would have lived,I thought of it as a sad depresing book form chapter two and on."
3,Super Go!!!!,I thought the book was good in the beginning and in the end because it had a lot to do with death. Well most kids in middle school would say that. The middle was not that good. I recomend this book to some people like in 7th grade and up!
3,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"This book is about the author's life growing up on a farm inLearning, Vermont. The descriptions are very interestin."
3,"...from coupeville, washington",I thought that this was a good book because it has a lot ofspecific details. Another reason I liked this book is because it'sabout a boy my age that gets a pig because he saved his neighbors cow. The only part of the book I don't like is that the author runs naked in a field to save the cow. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes non-fiction books.
3,"mike from coupeville, washington",the review tells you about how much i liked the book. i thought that this was a good book because it has a lot of specific details. another reason i liked this book is because it's about a boy my age that gets a pig because he saved his neighbors cow.the only part of the book i don't like is that the author runs naked in a field to save the cow.
4,A book we're reading in class,"I really enjoy this book even though it is a little gory in the beginning. The author is very descriptive about his own life and I find that interesting. We are reading this in class so we don't get very far every day, but we move along. Over all I really love this book."
4,Life on the frontlines.,"This book illustrates what many Americans have experienced growing up on the farm. Life can be both brutal, and gentle. Peck has done a good job showing how close death really is to those not insulated from it as we are. I think that this is a good book to read to the kids."
1,Insensitivity Glorified,"I kept turning pages waiting for Robert's epiphany -- the moment he would realize the obscene cruelty of his family's way of life and take a stand against it. Instead, he comes to fully embrace it, to glorify it, without ever realizing that other paths are even possible. While the book has some literary merit, the message is morally unacceptable. The ability to repress compassion is NOT a virtue."
1,Graphic Situations Ruined A Good Story,"Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy. It could have been such a nice book.To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much. The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.Then there is the pig mating scene. Yes, we all know ""it"" happens, but my child does not need to read about ""thrusting"" and blood running down the gilt's leg. The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it. Great message for young girls.When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories. One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations. Much is lost on them.The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book."
1,A book that glorifies animal cruelty,"I'd give this book zero stars if I could. It sends a message that ""growing up"" involves butchering pets. There is also dog abuse and a nasty pig rape scene. And this book is assigned to children? We should teach children to respect and care for animals. This book graphically depicts harming and in one case murdering pets."
3,"Day No Pigs Will Die, Peck",Days no pigs die is a good book. There really is nothing special about the book. It gets very boring at times. Although there is some thrilling events that take place. The characters are very bland and its kind of hard to relate to them because the book takes place in the past. The books reading level is really low and is not a book that will challenge you reading skills. This book is good for readers that want a book taking place in the south in the past other then this the book does is nothing special.DHS13
3,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"This book is written by Robert Newton Peck.It is about aboy named Robert. Robert is a Shaker boy who lived in Vermont inthe 1930's. He gets a pig as a gift from his neighboor. He raises it for years until something tragic happens to the pig. My favorite part is about the restrooms and the perverts. If your in for some good laughs and some tragic endings, then please read this book."
3,Appealing and Appauling,"I think that 'A Day No Pigs Would Die' is a wonderful book. I disliked some and liked some. Very touching and very addicting. This book points out a lot of views and analogies and shows much patential. When I had first started reading this book, I did not like it. As I read on, things became more interesting and I couldn't set it down. Being a 9th grader in High School, I would have to say that this book wasn't so much challenging, but it was a very good book that had taught me a lot of new things that I may have taken me a longer time period to figured out and explore."
3,Very emotional story.,"This book was a very realistic and emotional story of a Shaker family. It was very touching at times and very heart wrenching at others. I believe it was well written for the most part, but there were a few scenes that were too graphic for young readers. I think it is appropriate for High School children and older. I read this book because my daughter was reading it in middle school. I am very glad I read the book!"
3,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"My book, was very interesting in the beginning, but got boring torwards the end. The beginning was interesting, because he helped a cow give birth to a calf. It was interesting because it gave good detail. It got boaring because every thin died off at the end. For example there apple trees died, theyn started starving so they killed there pet pig pinky. They started hunting to get more food but they only caught colds. The dad got a cold so bad he slept out in the barn so the family didn't catch it as bad. The fathers cold got so bad it turned into pneumonia. He survived the winter and that spring he died. They latter burried him in the grassy land. I gave my book three stars, because it was good but not great. I reccomend this book to people."
1,I didn't like it.,"Though I'm sure there are many people out there who would enjoy this book, I am not one of them. I found this book to be one of the books I have enjoyed the least out of all the books I have ever read. The author was extremely too elaborate when it came to birth and death scenes, and if sad stories depress you, stay away from this one. The plot was not thought out enough, and at times the young boy in the story seemed to be way too ignorant for a boy his age."
1,"""A Day No Pigs Would Die""","Reader: ~Sara~Arnold, MarylandI thought the book ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" was a waste of paper. First, the book was really graphic. There are several scenes in the book, which makes me disrespect farmers. Specifically, when they weaseled hussy. Also when they tried to breed Pinky, and when they slaughtered Pinky. Second, the words were hard to comprehend since they had poor grammar. Third, the book is not realistic for teens today and it doesn't appeal to them. I feel this way because the book takes place on a farm which no one now a day lives on and kids can't grasp the concept. In conclusion, I think that this book should have been printed about 60 years ago to have any success."
2,"I think it was a pointless, dumb book - read Redwall instead","It was a sad, sick, gross, depressing, ugly, totally pointless book. I can't see how anyone could rate this ""5"" unless they're weird. If you really want good books- read Redwall tales"
1,I used it to prop open my door,"This was a horrible book. The book was slow and it was disgusting. An example of this was when peck slaughtered Pinkey, and how rob kissed his bloody hand. Or when they described Hussey after she came out of the barrel. There is no information in the book that I will ever use in my life. The family in the book was ""shakers"" so why did they have children? That's really dumb. They were just a bunch of slack-jaws. The dialogue was odd and it was hard to understand. It was hard tolerate the book and its bad language after the first chapters. It was defenatly not a page-turner. And in what society do you save a cow and get a pig in return?"
2,Boring book,"It is not exciting at all. All it talks about is a boy's life, the author, and his father in why and how he kills pigs for a living. I do not recomend it to anyone unless they enjoy boredeness. Ages 8 and up could read it."
1,Read this my freshman year...,"I absolutely hated this book. So much that 13 years later I am on Amazon wasting my time writing a review. It was required reading, so I read every page. It was graphic! A pig gets graphically slaughtered. I remember nothing else from the book. It was disturbing. I love bacon as much as the next person, but i hated reading this."
4,Sweet,"An enjoyable coming-of-age novel. It describes a lifestyle that would be very attractive to city slickers who tend to romanticize country life, but in itself it is a solidly good book about the importance of hard work and good values. The story is sweet--a surprise since it is about plain folk and told in plain language--and the themes of love and maturity are explored subtly and well. I especially enjoyed reading about the relationship between Robert and his father. I would have liked to meet Robert's father, but as it is I already benefit greatly from his wise words, such as ""Never miss an opportunity to keep your mouth shut."""
2,Slow But Humorous,"I think that A Day No Pigs Would Die is not a good book to read. Robert peck, the author, is telling the story of his life. I just hope his life really isn't as boring as the book. Although the book has some humorous parts like when his pants are ripped off by briar bushes, there are many disgusting and inappropriate parts like in chapter 13. Before our class read this book, I heard from other classes how graphic some parts in this book were. Also, this book does not have much of a plot. Robert's ideas are just thrown out in an un-organized way. I think that Robert should have had a professional writer, write down the events in Robert's life. I do not recommend this book for any ages to read. This book definitely does not keep your attention and is the slowest book I have ever read...."
3,A Slow Day No Pigs Would Die,"In my opinion A Day No Pigs Would Die is a vary slow paced book, with graphic senses and a heavily developed plot. The book was vary slow with the many long conversations and the not-so-exciting events of most of the chapters. The only exceptions were chapters one and 10. One was vary suspenseful with Apron's birth and Rutland Fair was comical. One thing I noticed about the book was that the author didn't skip on the details of the gore, such as the 1st chapter and chapter 14. One thing the author did well on was the hugely developed plot. Using the seasons as an example of the circle of life. I give this book three stars. It's moving but I care little for slow- paced books."
1,This Book Was HORRIBLE!,"I would never recomend this book to anybody. There are numerous affaris, deaths, and the boy has to kill his pet. Who would wnat to read this garbage. I was forced to read it in school and I could barley make it through on page withough cringing! Do not waste your money on this book! I wouldn't even give this book 1 star."
1,I hated the book!,"I hated the book because it was so slow. It had some details I didn't really need to read. I thought it was too bloody, for example when they killed hussy and when they killed Pinky, it said, ""the ground beneath our feet was spotted with hot pig blood. I think that some of the conversations didn't need to be included. Rob was talking to his father about a fence that is one example of a conversation. I also think it was too descriptive. I really hated this book."
2,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"Robert Newton Peck's book, A Day No Pigs Would Die, is a great book for all ages. There are many enjoyable and unpleasant parts in the book. When Pinky, the pig, won the blue ribbon for the best-behaved pig was an enjoyable scene. When Pinky won the award, Robert, Pinky's owner, was very proud of himself for his work he had put into Pinky, and he was proud of Pinky for winning the prize. From the novel,I learned that one should always take care for a pet."
2,Save your money. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"I absolutely hated this book. We had to read it in school and I had a hard time finishing it because it was so boring. That is odd for me because I absolutely love to read. If you ask me this book has a poor storyline. Why would anyone want a pet pig, they should have bought him a dog."
2,Needs to come with a warning for graphic content,"This book gave me nightmares as an adult. If you are a parent with a sensitive child or teen, especially one who is an animal lover, you need to know that this book contains graphic detail about animal killings. I am surprised that some schools are requiring students to read this book. Although I'm not advocating banning the book, educators should know better than to force students to read it. I agree with some of the young people who have written reviews stating that this book is horrifying. Tragic is one thing; brutal is another. The story could have been told effectively without creating gruesome images that overshadowed the plot. The author crossed the line with this one."
3,A Day No Pigs Would Die.,"This was a good book. After you read a page it made you want to read more. This was a story about a Shaker boy who received a outstanding pig. Every page was loyal, respectful, happy, and sad at the same time. Read on and find out how the boy and the pig's relationship was."
5,Realistic and honest,"A Day No Pigs Would Die is a compelling book. It's extremely sad and heart breaking to read. I definitely cried toward the end. As a vegetarian and animal lover, it was very hard to read some of the passages here. That doesn't take away the amazing story of compassion and endurance in this novel.While I am certainly surprised by the low ratings of this book, I can understand it. The themes and descriptions in this story could easily be considered controversial. But they are realistic. They are not meant to shock or to provoke. This is real life. The author doesn't sugar coat the grim realities of a Shaker family.Again, I am impressed by how certain authors can write so much in such few pages. There are so many descriptions and emotions in this book. I definitely recommend this novel to young adults and adults alike.4.5 stars, which rounds to 5 stars."
2,"very boring, and not a fun book, adults would appreciate it",I thought it was depressing and pointless. my mom read it and liked it and appreciated it more because she is older. i dont like sad books. I am in the 9th grade
1,a day no pigs would die,"How could anyone give this book to a child? A mating scene which reads like brutal rape after which the farmer comments, ""next time she'll welcome the big boy"". After not producing a litter the pigs life is considered worthlessand the child's treasured pet is slaughtered by the father, the boy is forced to participate and is then told he is a man for killing. My son was sickened by this book, I would like to warn all parents."
1,I had no emotions for the characters in this book.,"Although I admire Robert Pecks's effort, I was not satisfied with this book. I hardly felt any emotions for the characters, and I had to force myself to finish the book. There is no definite plotline-- the entire book is like a journal that the main character wrote. There were hardly any significant events, and I do not think the Shaker way of life was portrayed in its true sense. After the climax, the main character suddenly matures from a foolish boy to a well respected man. I find this unbelievable, and I do not think that the book developed itself evenly, if at all. My last comment is the fact that this book is so uneventful, it leaves unsatisfied."
1,A Day No Pigs Would Die.,I think this book was a little to descriptave. It was horrible and mean. I'm not saying I'm a sissy it's just the part with the dog and the weasel!! I mean what the heck were they thinking!????? I truly have to admit this was the worst book I have ever had to read!!!!!!!! Do not read this book if you love animals. It will tear your heart in half! :0( I feel so bad for animals who are slaughtered for stupid reasons like not being able to have children or because there the runt. I Hated this book!!
5,"Great book for adults, and to read to children.","I first read this book about 15 to 20 years ago to my 2 boys on a backpack trip. It's well written, imparting a textured view of a long-ago time. There are universal themes about family connections, and people/animal connections. I have given it as gifts, and just bought my own permanent hard cover copy to re-read. I heartily recommend it."
2,A Day No Pigs WOuld Die Book Review,"This is a story about a boy named Robert Peck and his pig named Pinky who live on a farm in Vermont. Robert after school was attacked, but by what? He got a baby pig as a reward, but what did he do to deserve it? At the end of the story there will be a shocking ending for the Peck family, but what is it? If you're a reader who likes to read about farms or animals you should read this book. This book was okay but if you like action or you like adventure this may not be the book for you. I gave it two stars. In my opinion the age group for this book is for children ten to twelve years old"
2,baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad,"i thought that this book was horrible, with worse grammar than even smoky the cowhorse, an absolutely, horrificly stupid main character, a bad ending, and several contradicting points,one of which being: ""You ain't got no sense, boy!"" said by one character to the main one, and then on the very next page, ""You're a very keen boy."" It also had several pointless things, such as ""There was grass everywhere. pinky was rolling in it."" who cares?????!!!!!!!! It also had something like, ""I like boats. And chicken."" once per page. I don't know why it got good reviews, because my only one for it is: baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad."
2,Not for Children,"I recently read this book because my daughter is reading it in her 7th grade English class. I was very disturbed by a few scenes and don't believe that this book belongs in a middle school English class. If this book were in movie form, it would be rated ""R"". The scene about ""weazeling the dog"" and ""breeding(or should I say raping) the barren pig were too much for me to stomach, let alone my 12 year old daughter. Needless to say, my daughter will not be finishing this book. Parents beware of this book if your youngsters are reading it at school. Please ask!"
1,Inappropriate for kids,"This book is disgusting. The fact that it's foisted upon 6th graders is a real curiousity to me. My daughter was forced to read this book when she was 11 and could barely make it through. The teacher seemed to delight in her uncomfortableness with the book. I may be old fashioned, but this is not an appropriate coming of age book for children. The sex and the violence are just too graphic! If you have a sensitive child avoid this book if you can. If your teacher assigns it pen her down on what redeeming value it has."
3,"Interesting Story, but religiously inaccurate","I found this book engaging enough, but it was marred by several inaccuracies. The Shakers described in the book are certainly not true to life. Firstly, all Shakers were celibate.There would be no children living with a mother and father. Secondly, Shakers lived communally. There would be no privately owned individual farms. Lastly, there is also no ""Book of Shaker"" as mentioned. The people in the story sound more like Mormons than Shakers."
4,Amazing,"Vernor Vinge is one of my absolute favorites. So, finding this little 'bagatelle' with slightly more than 200 pages was like finding a gem. His idea about the talent of the planet's inhabitants is absolutely original and makes you smile while reading."
1,The Misogynist Ending From Hell!,"Well, I just finished this book...my fiance claims I should give him another chance and read his later stuff. However, I am dubious. This book should be called ""Witling, or How I Learned To Stop Thinking and Become a Happy Bimbo"". Sheesh Vern, give us double-X chromosome types a bit more credit, will ya? I hope you're as embarassed now by this dog of a book as my fiance thinks you are. 50 lashes with a wet noodle and 10 years reading ""The Feminine Mystique""."
4,very interesting premise,"Humans arrive on a planet where technology is not advanced, but the inhabitants have mental powers superior to humans (ie, the ability to teleport themselves and objects). Good hard science, if you're a fan of that, in taking account real physics (like rotation of the planet), but also just a good story, which makes it a winner for me."
2,What is the main,"requirement for a film sound track? It should not distract attention from the action on the screen, it should complement this action. Trying to make an educated guess, the film is about something red. You don't want to go to a show about something red and have a rock concert instead. So not much to expect. The title track is a good piece. The same tune surfaces in Notturno Breve."
5,I Like & Recommend This Soundtrack,"I do like and recommend this soundtrack {ASIN:B00005YE9B: When the Whales Came}. I was actually surprised to find this tape was still available. The one CD soundtrack of this movie that I found cost a lot more then the cassette tape. I was also highly pleased with the great sound quality of the tape. Further, I received this tape much earlier then feared, and it came in excellent condition."
4,A thought provoking book about the nature of love.,"The Dark Blood of Poppies is the third of Britains answer to Anne Rice's Vampire Sequence. The first two, A taste of Blood Wine and A Dance in Blood Velvet, introduced us to the characters of Charlotte and Karl. Brillant and thought provoking they make us question the nature of love and immortality while engageing and entertaining the reader. I can also recommend Warringtons novel The Dark Cathedral and its follow up Pagan Moon. It's not very often that you use the word life altering about books but these two totally changed my out look on life and view on Paganism."
5,I have read 'A dance in blood velvet' is this the 2nd novel?,"I loved 'A dance in blood velvet' and knew it was part of a series - but is it the 1st or 2nd one?I see that The Dark Blood of Poppies is the third, can someone please fill me in?"
2,"Not for 2"" Pipe","Hello, these will NOT fit over a 2"" pipe. Package saids for up to 1 7/8"" So if you have a 2"" tail pipe is not the one you want.Don"
3,Am I going to pay for this a fourth time?,"I think Warner may have pulled the plug on the quantity pressed of the Ultimate cut since they already were saturated in two versions of the DVD, a Blu-Ray Director's cut, a Blu-Ray video game with the film in the package, the Black Freighter in both formats, and a video motion comic. Phew! They also gave it a list price that would milk every last cent out of only the diehard fanboys who held out to the end or had to have it to own every version.But will I buy this one just to see the Black Freighter cut into the film? I think the high cost after seeing the IMAX showing and buying the Blu-Ray, the Game (w/Movie) and the Black Freighter disc is the dealbreaker on this one. I can just pop in the Black Freighter DVD when I know where to cut it in myself. Sorry, Zack, maybe when it shows up on the Goldbox Deals page at half off!"
4,Cool concepts,"It's a basic gritty crime superhero movie, but has some fun spins and concepts around they're powers and backstory. Worth a watch, but not a purchaser for me."
4,Fantastic Adaptation to the Graphic Novel,"This is probably one of my favorite superhero films. It was faithfully adapted from a great graphic novel, and the visual effects are top-notch. Well-written characters, fleshed out by great actors. Smart, entertaining, and enjoyable."
5,Great piece,This gorgeous piece is absolutely accurate like appears in Watchmen movie.Is made in robust material.I'm very satisfied for this purchase.
3,"Damn you Greed, damn you.","I'm going to make this short.I loved ""Watchmen"" I thought it was a great film, and absolutely had to buy this when it came out. But honestly this cut is bad. The ""Black Freighter"" fit in well with the comic but in his film it feels cheap and out of place. They just did not adapt it well to the plot and I found that the animation looked pretty poor compared to the amazingly high quality of this film. I enjoyed the director's cut much more.Pros: -Great boxset, made it worth keeping. Beautiful and high quality box and pictures.-The digital copy is of the directors cut.-Bonus materials are nice and plentiful.Cons: -The animation sucked, and was distracting to this great film.- The animated cut is the only cut of the film available in this set.The only reason I'm keeping this is because the boxset is so nice. This would be a 5 star review if the other editions of the film were available. The guilty party here is greed. Take it from an unbiased customer."
3,"I liked the movie, but a couple key scenes are missing.",A couple scenes are missing. 1) Rorschach explanation of why he is the way he is. 2) Adrian Veidt's explanation of his past life. I was disappointed that these scenes were not included.
3,A little slow but still glad I bought it,I had seen a lot of buz on the Watchmen and had wanted to see it. Long movie with several slow spots. Probably more gore than needed. But glad I bought it.
4,Comic Books for The Intellectual,"Dense, cerebral, and bone-crunchingly satisfying, this seminal cult classic adapted to screen quite successfully. Both an homage to the comic hero tradition, and an indictment of our societal bent towards hero-worship, this story pulls off the unique trick of being both the object of interest and its own reflection. Good thinking fun!"
5,I just had to see it all,"I am so glad I ordered and recieved this DVD so quickly. I caught part of it on TV and I really wanted to see it all. It was a good storyline. A bit dark, but a good story. A different view of super heros. I would suggest the DVD. Perhaps, it might not be for children but 17 and above should be fine."
2,"Beautiful effects and composition, most boring super hero story ever","I'm very much in the minority in my opinions of The Watchmen, both the movie and graphic novel. I was unable to finish the graphic novel. It never seemed to get to the point and just plodded along. Well after watching the movie this weekend, the movie makers have remained true to the novel's lack of excitement. My wife and I kept thinking, when will this story get going, get on with it already. While I enjoyed the films beautiful effects and scene compositions, the story never gets pumping. I never had any empathy for any of the characters in this movie. In fact after the movie was over the only character I found even remotely redeeming was Rorschach, and he was a sociopathic killer. I'm very sorry I bought this DVD knowing that I didn't like the book. I should have known better. A total waste of money."
2,Not My Favorite,"I was told this movie stayed true to the graphic novel. Maybe it did but I wouldn't know. I didn't read the novel. I was just interested in visual effects and the fact that it was a super hero movie. So I figured what the heck. My first clue should have been the fact that it was Rated R. Maybe I am a bit over sensitive but I was turned off by two things:1. Lack of a background about the super heroes. I would have liked to know more. It seemed compressed to me.2. Male frontal nudity in several scenes. I'd like someone to explain to me how that helped the plot/storyline.I saw this movie with a few friends who are less critical than I am and one of them asked afterwards if this movie warranted a ""What The ----?"". Which spoke volumes to me. All in all I guess the action and fight scenes were what made this arguably tolerable but everything else was a major disappointment. I did not enjoy this movie at all!!!"
1,"Overblown, Over Hyped","This had to be the most boring movie I had ever seen. Jackie Earle Haley was good in it--but that is about it. Over-blown, over-hyped and just over."
2,can't believe I wasted my money seeing this movie,"Didn't buy wouldn't buy, dark grim movie of super heros who are not really heros or even good. The one good guy was made to look bad the entire time and killed in the end by a fellow hero/ freak. Didn't buy it, want a refund from going to see it when it came out."
1,terrible,"Terrible, boring, waste of time. My husband and I both thought it was awful. It was extremely slow and there was minimal action. Don't bother watching it."
2,"Tired saga: ""Watchmen"" (Snyder, 2009)","""Watchmen"" has the same relation to good cinema as hip-hop has to Beethoven. Of course, this should not stop you to watch it. I would wait for the obligatory ""extended"" cut, but it is your money. It has its pleasures, such as the (violent) story of one of the vigilant heroes (Rorschach) and some slick visuals. The rest is a tired saga of puppets saying supposedly profound stuff, ala ""Dark Knight"". The good thing is that, unless we get ""Maus"" on screen, Hollywood must now get their ideas from other sources other than comics (and I am relieved by that).Note: I did not read the comic. As with any medium, comics can also contain masterpieces that can shape our understanding of ourselves and be tools for a better future. I simply do not trust the way by which Hollywood can handle the best works of this genre, being this film a proof."
2,too long,"great special effects with a good storyline and good ending. Problem is that most of the super hereos were average at best. It was way,way too long! I could cut out 30 minutes of this movie and miss nothing. Too much blue junk. Cover that up! It adds nothing to the movie. I left the theater saying that I could never sit through that again."
1,More Hollywood anti-American garbage!,"This is the most boring Hollywood crap I have ever seen, and I have seen several really bad movies. The anti-American themes run throughout the movie and reminds me of some propaganda the United Nations would put out. The so called heroes remind me of the flower kids from the 60's breaching peace, love, and drugs. This movie is extremely boring and long and you can't wait for it to be over, I almost walked out before the end, which by the way made no since. Save your money and time and do not buy this, you have been warned!!!!!!!"
1,Slow & Long,"Loved the CGI but the drama was taking for ever, plus too long. It is like Sin City meets 300, meets The Incredibles (Disney), and then meet The Spirit."
1,boring,"the movie is boring to someone whos never read the comic. After watching it I couldnt help but notice I just wasted 10$ plus my sisters ticket 10$. We both didnt like it, bad choice of music it was just not our movie, im sure ill get alot of remarks from people who did like the movie but who cares im here for my opinion not their's."
1,Subterranean Trash,"WTF ? Huh ? There is never any indication that a story is unfolding. Other than the skull hatcheting piece by bloody bandage head guy and the arm sawing through the jailhouse bars scene, there's little to discuss or keep you interested except maybe well-hung blu guy Dr. Manhatten driving girl to glowing blue extacy. A freaking, jigsawing, nightmare. Intended strictly for comic book advocates who enjoy speed viewing tales of their super heroes."
1,A Real Snooze Fest,"I have nothing against noir, but that seemed to be the focus of this movie to the point where I lost interest in the first ten minutes, which seemed to be one big dragged out scene showing the blood on the street trickling onto the smiley face button. Outside of that, I can't remember a whole lot about the movie as I fell asleep within the first half hour. I woke up, watched a bit more, fell asleep again. We finally turned it off and never finished it. It was that good!I'll give the director points for noir, but as for pacing and plot and just keeping it interesting, this is one of the worst I've seen in a while.Not recommended."
1,A review from a non comic book fan,Let me start by saying that I'm not a comic book fan. I didn't even know the Watchmen exist before I went see this movie. So excuse me if I offend any of the hardcore fans.To me this movie is good and bad at the same time. The actions scenes are just superb... but those are too few and too far apart to make this movie good. For me 2:40 minutes siting in the theater is too long unless you care to provide a really interesting movie. I got so bored between the action scenes that almost leave the theater. They should just cut this movie to be 1:30 minutes tops... and then release the 2:40 minute extended version for the fans or make it a two part movie.
1,Rubbish! Rubbish! Rubbish!,"I could not understand what on earth this movie was about! I gave up after one hour(the longest hour of my LIFE!!) The characters were never introduced, It was ifthe director just wanted to get as much action into the movie as possible.Give this a miss unless you want to be bored to tears :o("
1,DON'T DO IT !,"I rented this movie for $4 and I overpaid by $3. It is horrible from the beginning to end. It always looks like it's gonna turn around and become worth watching but it never does.....NEVER!I gave it 1 star and that's only because some of the ""special fx"" were good [not great]. The story line is horrible and the ending is so bad that you have to see it to believe it but, I wouldn't wish that on you and you're just a stranger reading this review.Bad! Bad! Grab Your Money and Run Away!"
3,Watchmen Dir. Cut,I bought this through Amazon. The movie was awesome! Because I travel a lot I was not able to get my digital copy from the United States until recently. Unfortunately when I went to retrieve the digital copy of the Director's cut online I was given the wrong code. It also asked me to fill in mailing information to send me what I should already have. Am I upset a little for the price that I paid for this? Yes! Ensure that you have everything checked before the time to return an item! Now I have a movie and fancy plastic head holder with a digital copy that I can not watch.
2,Hard to sit through,"I, my wife and my 16-year-old daughter watched this Blu-ray together. We are all sci-fi fans, but we found it very hard to sit through this movie. My daughter in fact went back to her own room mid-way. The special effects and cinematography are top-notch no doubt, but the movie just starts and stops, starts and stops too often. If you are a teenager, you would feel like you are starting to play a video game for 2 minutes, and then your mother comes in and tells you to do your homework for 30 minutes, and you have to obey. And the cycle keeps repeating. The dialogues are long and hard to fathom. Sorry, but the protagonist (Dan) has more the look and presence of a second supporting actor. Overall, what a waste of all that production."
2,Lots of Big Blue **** Not Much Else,"Uhh Really this movie was wack....I loved the Comic Book and loved the comic book for what it was...But much of the politics of the Book just dont translate to film because the Director's lack of Creative Vision and he just doesnt have the Guts to add in real time politicians in and replace the throwback 80's mixed made up history stuff....The Film would have been so much more powerful had they Changed the Timeline to Present Day, cut out all those unnecessary shots of DR Manhattan's penis(the whole being naked thing losses its sting after a while and just becomes purely ridiculous), found a better silk specture ....On the bright side Jackie Lee Haley is an awsome Rorscach, Patrick Dem is a great Nightowl, and the Comedian was played very well also....Rent it dont buy it..."
3,Watchmen Blu ray,Short and sweet this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Parts of this movie just went on and on and on.
2,Far too long,"Though some think they were cheated by the Theatrical release, the best version this is not. It is too long, disjointed, annoying, and prone to itchy fingers on the ffwd button. The intermediate Director's Cut seems to be the best version. Enough of the cut scenes to fill in the gaps, and extraneous material thoughtfully excised.I am not a fan of G. Butler, and the animated inserts did nothing but kill the momentum of the story, leaving the audience searching for ""meaning"" in the garbled diction and blurry vocalizations. (I found myself searching for the transitions, jumping too far past the boring animated sections and the newsstand banter.)""Watchmen"" is a complex, convoluted and well textured movie, and it often requires multiple viewings to grasp it all. Slogging repeatedly through 3 plus hours becomes more a chore than entertainment. Ultimate cut in length, but not ultimate in entertainment.This is definitely a case of ""Goldilocks"" where the middle version is just right."
3,Visually strong,"Incredible how much the images in the film match the comic. But I was disappointed that somehow the finished product lacked the soul of the original. Still, worth watching for all fans."
2,Rent it.,While the effects are great...it gets bogged down. It maybe somewhat faithfull to the comic but it just lacks. It had all the makings to be a great movie..budget..the dark feel. Yet as for myself I really do not care for the sex scene..okay so he went to pound town on her? Do I really need to see...no.It is visually stunning but other than that...it is best as a rental. Due to the fact that it drags itself forward it has little replay value to me.Yet if you can get it for 8 dollars it's a solid deal.
4,Works for the uninitiated,"The Bottom Line:A long film that doesn't feel long, Watchmen is an astonishing visual experience (for all his faults director Zach Snyder sure can craft a pretty frame) that has its flaws--the scenes with Rorschach work far better than anything with Matthew Goode or Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman, some of the flashbacks don't make much sense to neophytes--but Jackie Earle Haley is great, the CGI is very effective, and the film works as *spectacle* even when it fails a little as a story; no one can deny that Watchman has issues, but it succeeds despite them.3/4"
5,WUVED IT!!!!,"Let me say it again... Wuved this movie!!!Die hard watchmen fan or not will enjoy this movie. This movie shows that unlike ""Superman and Friends"" of other comics these heroes have flaws. Through the watchmen you see that the world is not black and white but grey with all its ugliness and sometimes the right decisions are oft times the hardest ones no matter who gets hurt.Anyway, the action and the special effects were amazing!!!Warning: Parents out there this is not a kid's flick so....Anyway, highly recommend this movie!!!!"
5,I watch the Watchmen...,"Great movie, even better than the theatrical version. Also has better special features than the standard 2 disc edition (Which is what we are limited to in Australia).Note: Disc is Region Free so will work on any Blu-Ray player in any country!Unfortunately though the Digital Copy Disc is only licenced to the US & Canada so it won't work elsewhere."
4,"Great Movie adaptation, but no digital copy","The movie is awesome, and watch it again with the extended scenes it is another experience indeed.The only downsize is no digital copy, otherwise I would give 5 starts."
4,Blue Ray Watchman,The movie arrived on time and was packed very safely as to avoid damage. Easy to open and the move is great.
3,Double Dipping!,"It's so frustraiting to purchase a product because you love it and want to support it to have the stuido/company release the ""ultimate"" version just months later. The move was very enjoyable, but now this product is basically worthless since it's lacking so many more things that are in the ultimate edition. It reminds me of what they did with Sin-City. Either you buy the newest edition and support the idea that they can keep doing this to the fans and getting even more out of us, or stand your ground and miss out on the extras!"
5,Watch The Watchmen,Not for kids so don't expect to see a Spiderman/Superman type film. This movie is grittier and more towards adolescents and adults.
3,Two-Disc Special Edition... what for?,"First of all: this is a really cool movie and a great Director's Cut. I really love it and therefore immediatly ordered this DVD.BUT I'm a little dissappointed about the extras... I expected more for a ""Two-Disc Special Edition"" than a couple of Journals I've already seen on the internet months before theatrical release, a music video and a featurette. There's not even the amazing trailers on the discs.I'm pretty sure there is way more extras to come but I guess those will only be available on the ultimate edition... nice way to get the money out of our pockets :-/"
5,WOW! Loved it!,"I had the opportunity to read the graphic novel before seeing this movie. Loved the novel and really looked forward to the movie after hearing good things about it. Watching the movie I just found it fantastic in how it captured the graphic novel almost scene for scene.The very minor changes in the movie, the lack of the pirate comic and the details at the end I think made it better. The ending seemed a bit more believable. I didn't care for the pirate comic that much reading the graphic novel, and still really didn't get any connection with it and the rest of the story.Overall,I'd have to say this is one of my favorite comic book superheroe movies."
4,CGI as good as I have seen,"The story is interesting but could have used a bit more character development, a fairly intelligent plot line, it did keep me interested throughout. I will watch it again. The special effects and computer animation was as good as I have seen it so far. Very hard to distinguish between CGI an real life (and I was looking for it). Overall I recommend this movie and especially in Bluray."
5,Beautiful Action,"5 Stars!!! A must buy for Blu-ray owners, noir fans, comic fans and detective stories... Great extras to..."
4,Watchmen in a confined space.,"Formost, I read the Watchmen as they appeared in comic book form. When I heard there was going to be a movie, I immediately said it should be done like Lord of the Rings; that is a long movie released in 3 parts. I was actually pleased the movie was done as well as it was in a shortened format. Spoiler alert! The only deviation, and part I didn't like was making Dr.Manhattan the fall guy for a sinister plot instead of creating the alien form that was transported to New York to fool the world into thinking they needed to unite to defeat an alien attack. Other than that, I feel the script/novel was followed close enough, the actors were perfectly chosen for their parts, and the overall movie was excellent. I did miss Captain Metroplis who actually chaired the first, and only, meeting of the Crimebusters."
5,BEST MOVIE OF 2009!!,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. It was smart, it was action packed, and it even had a few kinda funny moments. All the characters were very varied and interesting. However, the ones that really stood out, of course, were Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach. I don't even know what to say, I was just so blown away by this movie. A must see! :D"
4,Uh... You Might Wanna Read The Graphic Novel First,"Just a brief review since I've just seen the film at the theater & it's still fresh in my head.This was actually better than I thought it was gonna be. The basic spine of the story of the original comic book mini-series is strong enough to carry the movie along, especialy since Snyder & co. didn't jack w/ it too much.The main reoccurring thought I had while watching the film was, ""Gee, I feel really bad for anyone who didn't read the original story before watching this, because they'll probably be incredibly confused."" Go ahead & see it w/o reading the graphic novel 1st. But don't say I didn't warn ya not to."
3,Option to watch the theatrical cut?????,"I really liked this movie. I did not know what to expect considering I did not care for 300. I thought this movie was really well done, very pretty to the eye. My negative comments come from the fact I did not have the option to watch the theatrical release of this movie on blu-ray. Has it ever crossed the distributors minds that I might want to watch the regular version and not sit through the extra 30 minutes? The fact they do not give you the option is ridiculous. Otherwise, a good lazy afternoon flick."
5,Masterpiece,"I'm a very tough critic. Most of the movies I've seen lately are just plain stupid. Watchmen was without doubt the coolest most unique movie I've seen in years. The formula for this movie is a first. It's unlike any other comic book style movie you've seen, but in a good way. There are so many nuances and wow factors that it would take a book to describe them here.Beware, in the directors cut, there is some frontal male nudity, albeit from a blue being. There are a few extremely violent scenes as well. It's long too. Just over 3 hours. The only thing that I think didn't fit in some scenes was the music. Too Vietnam-ish.Overall, this movie gets 5 stars from me. It was just that cool."
1,One-Star for Double Dipping:,"The movie was fine, I'm sure the directors cut will be good too... what isn't cool is packing in an advertisement for $10 off the Ultimate 5 disc Collectors Edition which will be available at Christmas. They're not only double dipping you, they're telling you after you buy the product that you're being double dipped.It's really not cool to slam fans like this... The 5 disc version will include the Tales of the Black Freighter intercut with the rest of the film. It will also have the Hollis Mason ""Under the Hood"" documentary and the motion comic.So if you already bought those discs and you buy the movie you're pretty much SOL. You're getting triple dipped at that point.Tell the movie companies that you aren't going to play their game. Pass on this preliminary edition, rent it if you want, and then buy the real 5 disc version when it comes out at Christmas."
5,"Loved the movie, nicely done in hidef","If you liked the movie, seeing it again in this Blu-Ray won't disappoint. Good audio too. Always something I think tends to be a bit odd in some DVD/Blu-Rays (the audio being high in conversations, then low when music, or vice-versa, causing having to adjust the volume while watching). Not a problem in this Blu-Ray. Excellent."
4,Watchmen Director's Cut Not to Include Tales of the Black Freighter until Dec.,"This is not so much a review of the film, but a comment on the dvd. The Tales from the Black Freighter was said to be included on the director's cut of the dvd, however, it seems the additional footage are cut and extended scenes from the movie, and a 2nd director's cut is to be released in Dec. '09 which would be the definitive version with the extra footage and the Tales from the Black Freighter footage cut back in.I really hate double and triple dipping by studios, and I am not saying not to buy this when it comes out, but be aware that another version of the film is to be released at the end of the year.""Warner Bros. will release a director's cut on July 21, 2009, and the extended version with the animated film edited back into the main picture in December"" --Wikipedia"
4,"Love the Genre, Great adaptation!","Love the story, loved the dark side of hero worship! The director's cut is definitely more gory, but well worth it. The editorial extras are interesting, but a bit dry.Watchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
5,Watchmen: Ultimate Cut!,"Where do I begin...This ultimate cut brings everything together. The interwoven of the movie and tales of the dark freighter. It's so amazing! I loved it! Now...if you think this was good...wait till you see ""SUCKER-PUNCH"" This movie will blow you away! I will say no more. The director of this movie brings this movie to life so well and exactly the way the comic was done. What more can I say...if your a fan of the ""Watchmen"",the comics and the director. This movie is for you! Here's what you get: 5 disc's...Disc 1: The Ultimate Cut. Disc 2: Special Features: 5 featurettes and 11 video journals. Disc 3: Your Digital Copy. Then you have the ""Watchmen"" the complete motion comics...12 episodes.On 2 disc's...that's 4 & 5. Now...you need to get tales of the dark freighter by itself. There are few things that you don't see in the Ultimate cut...watch it and see for yourself. By itself...it's truly amazing! I say no more! And with that I say...""THE END IS NIGH"""
5,Watchmen review,"I was not familiar with the watchmen series of comics, but I was very interested in this movie when it first came out.When I finally got to see it I really enjoyed the different characters, and the story.I highly would recommend this to those who really enjoy the comic book heroes turned into movies.The director's cut has a more complete version that I enjoyed."
5,great movie killer extras,Buy this edition if you like this movie. If you have not seen it yet rent it then buy this cut. it is worth every penny.
2,watchmen dvd,"I'm a fan of comics and comic movies, but I didn't like this one. Too slow and not for the younger fans. Too adult oriented and not a very good movie at all."
2,high budget self indulgence,"Unfortunately, Zak Snyder (perhaps proving Alan Moore right that the book is not translatable to film) brought the same flash-over-substance ethic that he displayed in ""300"". At least in general terms, the adaptation was fairly spot on, as was the casting. In my opinion, this movie fails because the flash, in the form of gratuitously violent fight scenes, obnoxious stop-motion work and painfully long closeups, crippled the complex and otherwise thought provoking story. Add a horrifyingly bad soundtrack and you have 3 hours of movie that inspires *headdesk* at the high points and suicidal tendencies during the rest of the film."
1,"no, not cool","like i said in the title, this is not cool or ethical and is the dark side of America in general. this is what should have been out from day one of the dvd release but yet again they're trying to take advantage of the fans who really love an artistic masterpiece like Watchmen. [...], i will continue to not be some simp (that's my friends' and my slang for simple minded person) who lets the money grubbing jerks trying to make people double dip succeed. screw them. don't be a simp!!! on the other hand, if you haven't picked up Watchmen on dvd yet then i say go for it because this movie truly is a masterpiece and i would buy this if it wasn't for the double dip factor. my 1 star is based on priciple and circumstance, NOT the amazing movie which deserves more than the 5 star maximum."
1,Horrible,"I saw this movie in the theater back in March. I do not see what the point of this movie was or why it was so popular. If I may be blunt this was the biggest piece of garbage to come into the cinema. The story made no sense, the acting was absolutely terrible, and it was way too violent. It was too long and pornographic as well so this is not a movie for little children. Do yourself a favor and do not waste three hours of your life and do something more constructive."
2,Do you like looking at blue dongs?,"Does the idea of gazing at a circumcised blue penis for 30 minutes sound like fun to you?YES: Then by all means, watch this film!NO: I'd steer clear of this one, folks."
1,An abomination.,"The one thing you shouldn't defile is the things we grow up looking to as kids. Things like super heroes. This movie took that notion and destroyed it. Most of the ""powers"" were the same. Super heroes raped super heroines, for crying out loud. FOUL! The only saving grace at all was Rorshack."
1,Really Bad Movie,"I don't go to movies or watch TV. I go by buzz and reviews. I'm just really glad I got this really cheap.It was a bad movie - I still don't know what the plot / story was supposed to be, and I doubt I'll watch it again to figure that out.Wow, really, really bad. Don't waste your money."
2,"Apocalypse, or the end of music?","Im not sure what this movie is celebrating, superheroes, murder mysteries, evil violence, or just the brand new hope for the end of music as we know it, replacing it with the whining voices that have been shunned or set aside all these years, because it is here they make their grand debut out of our consciousness. At any rate, the soundtrack sucks with over political overtones of the lost 60s, and believe me, if the soundtrack sucks (I would exit a bar that played any of this), the movie does too, cause there is no movie classic with soundtrack that sucks. Even Thank God It's Friday disco movie had an award winning song in Last Dance. Now that was a real exit."
3,I rated it as okay because I never read the comic book...,"It was a good, solid movie, but I was surprised at how little I liked the characters. I never read many comics growing up, so I didn't expect how realistic and troubled the characters were. There was good acting and a decent mystery in this film, I'm rating it as Okay because of my ignorance going in to the film."
3,Great Movie,Just keep in mind that the digital copy included expired in July of 2010...I bought this for the digital copy to put on my PSP... :/
3,WARNING: Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray Coming December (with yet another cut),"If you are still considering getting this, and are wondering if there will be another bigger better edition coming out, your prayers are answered. Yet another even more complete edition is coming (With another cut of the film). The Director's Cut Blu-ray comes with a $10 off coupon for the Watchmen Ultimate Collector's Edition coming December 2009."
3,Watchmen,Had to watch this flick twice because I did not get it the first time. It's a dark movie but not real bad.
4,"movie is great, not all features work...","this is a great movie. blu-ray really does it justice.i was excited to get this movie, and even more excited when it arrived with a digital copy disc inside. the disappointment came when i tried to get the digital copy onto my ipod.the ""license"" expires after july 2010 so if you didn't buy the blu-ray before then you won't be able to use the digital copy disc for anything other than a coaster. toss-it, it's just junk.the movie is great, i can watch it again and again - just don't expect that convenience of the digital copy, you'll have to make your own. :("
2,"Video Good, Audio/Subtitles could be better","I watched this through a Tivo HD to a 1080p Sharp (2-Ch audio). The video quality was terrific!!! However, it seems that there is an issue with the audio down-mix for Tivo devices. The audio remastry effort should be done to THX standards, so you can hear the dialog!!!! Even more frustrating, there were no subtitles with this movie, so I was forced to turn up the volume to hear the dialog, but when explosions happened - I had to rush to turn down the volume again. It's REALLY terrible if you have to mess with the volume during the entire movie, it takes you out of the ""illusion"" of the movie and makes you focus on the playback hardware in a bad way. Tivo if you're reading this, put some foot-to-*** with the content provider, since this affects your customers!!Lack of subtitles meant I had no backup for getting dialog, had to suffer through it instead. Good movie though, I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray where it's done right."
2,A Movie for the Fans not the Masses,"I know the fans of the Watchman series of illustrated novels appreciated the movie. I am not familiar with the series but excited to watch the movie version. Well I was disappointed. The movie seemed to rely too much on prior story lines that so often I had no idea why characters were acting the way they did. I am not a prude but the romantic scenes were more distracting than helpful to advancing the movie. I felt the parts mostly came together at the end but I felt underwhelmed. Sure I could watch it again and get a lot more out of it, but frankly I don't want to bother - it just isn't worth it for the rest of us."
2,Directors Cut not worth it,"This is a rip off. I at least expected the Director commentary on the Director's Cut, but Oh No....you have to wait for the Christmas release.I'll be renting that and not buying another version. Even the extra scenes aren't worth the extra.Save your money and rent the movie and wait for the Super cut if you like extras"
2,Over hyped,I went into this will big expectations because all I heard from fanboys was how this was going to be the greatest movie ever made. I've never heard of the Watchmen before this movie so I had no idea what it was about. I thought the movie had an interesting story about super heroes being killed off but all the side stories with them covering their origins bored me to tears. That's my biggest problem with the movie. Most of it is boring. It's very long and very boring. I didn't care about any of the characters. They're all depressing. The movie didn't pick up until the last 20min and by then I was already half asleep.Watchmen fans probably enjoyed it more than I did. I'm a huge fan of super hero comic movies. But this one did nothing for me.
3,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE!,"The science fiction / superhero elements of this movie are absolutely spectacular, but the brutality and violence levels are so high, that I was turned off throughout most of the film. Had there been fewer bloody shootouts, fewer heads crashing into walls, fewer bodies exploding into smithereens, and less anguish and pain, I would have given WATCHMEN five stars.If you take away the gratuitous blood and gore, you are left with a brilliant sci fi / superhero movie that is visually stunning and thematically thought provoking. It might be asking for too much, but it would great if this movie could be re-edited to eliminate the extreme violence."
2,Unsatisfying.,"Who watches the watchmen? Watchmen (2008) is supposed to be a film adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. The film takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon has been elected for three terms and where Russia and the USA are about to engage in a massive nuclear war. The ""doomsday clock"" is set at 5 until midnight. Unfortunately that's all the movie offers. The superhero characters are rather pathetic. The only character that is even moderately interesting is the disturbed hero Rorschach. The Dr. Manhattan character which everyone raves about is particularly stupid. The film is disconnected, goes nowhere, and is utterly boring. The ending with ""The Smartest Man in the World"" falls completely flat. And, the homosexual undertones, rape scene, male nudity, and gratuitous sex scenes certainly aren't helping it any. Ugh. Ultimately I feel that it was pretty boring and not worthwhile."
2,Exceptional Story - Unecessary Gore and Violence,"The story line is exceptional. Movie stays true to the comic and has flashes of greatness that COULD have been enjoyed by the whole family had the director not felt the need to include large amounts of gratuitous, unecessary, and ultra-gruesome violence. I think it would have actually been MORE effective to have left much of the violence to the viewers imagination. Without the graphic violence, this would easily have been a five star review. Love the movie, but cant stand to watch it. What a shame."
4,Philosphical Treat!,"Even if you aren't familiar with this as the ""graphic comic"" (I was not), you WILL enjoy the philosophical ponderings of this movie.The authors had fun tweaking history and the super-hero theme, and made a great story. NONE of it is predictable and MUCH of it addresses Thomas Sowell's ""unconstrained vs. constrained"" model of the 2 human visions. If you are curious, see A Conflict of Visions.the plot is complex (at least, that is how the details of the story unfold) and requires your undivided attention. This story is long in ideas (and length, too) and short in ""emotion."" It's not, imho, intended to illicit emotion but thought.And it is fun! It has a genuine HERO character who's vastly entertaining and has a Top 10 hero quote!It's also a little rough around the edges (see ""graphic"") and still a treat to watch. Make sure you set aside plenty of time and few distractions to enjoy."
5,I love this movie!,"I just want to drop in my two cents worth. This was one of the best movies I have seen this year. Well done, interesting through out the movie. Casting was great and enough detail and storyline to make it worth a second watch."
5,A Visual Masterpiece,"Based on Alan Moore's classic Graphic novel, The Watchmen is an absolute feast for the eyes.This movie was geared towards the fans of the novel,but that being said it may be a bit of a headscratcher for the regular audience.Im making this review short and sweet,If your a fan this is an absolute must buy!"
4,"Good, but the book is better","The movie was a very faithful adaptation of the main plot line of the comic book, but a lot of the layering like the black freighter subplot, the details embedded in the psychological examination of Rorschach, and the complexities of Dr. Manhattan on Mars were removed. The sex and violence is a lot more jarring here than it was in the comic, and the characterization of Ozymandias and the Comedian removes several of the gray areas depicted in the comic as well. I loved both the comic and the movie, but one is a masterpiece of its genre, while the other is not."
5,Better than the Graphic Novel ?,"An overpowering adaptation of a classic grapic novel, The Watchmen Ultimate Edition takes you further into the dark alternate earth of 1985. I grew up on the graphic novel and I have to be honest this Edition finally surpasses any expectations. The cast assembled was perfect and the landscape for the tale was overwhelming at the least. Even a non-comic book fan , could find enjoyment with this film and still be left with a need for more. The only flaw I found with this movie was the use of that god-awful EMO band My Chemical Romance. Sorry my personal opinion is that that style/music is terrible. Sorry boys but skinny jeans are for women and homosexual men."
4,Great movie,"I really liked this movie. It's very creative, and they did the best job they could to follow the comic book with the time they had. It does have one really bizarre sex scene that I didn't really like, and it's not like I'm a prude, but it just was... weird. Haha. Anyway, other than that this nerdy girl really enjoyed it."
4,A great and fascinating edition of watchmen,"The extended version of the film is really immersive, the bluray picture is outstanding; there is a full disc with a the entire comic book (five hours): an artbook would have been more interesting for me..All in all, a great edition for a great film."
3,Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live),"The main feature is awesome but the extras are a little old for Watchmen fans. New viewers will enjoy them though.A rip off if you don't live in the USA or Canada - you don't get the digital copy.Yes, unbelievable huh? .. seems ridiculous that in 2009, there are geographical boundaries imposed on a technology that doesn't require anything location specific to work. Hello? It's ""The Internet"""
3,america's critic,"this movie fooled me, the effects were amazing the story was so boring, the trailer completely was a lie to the story, the acting was good hopefully next time it will be action packed like its preview."
1,watchman review,"This is the worst half of a movie that I have seen this year. It was such a load of garbage that I couldn't make it through to the end. The friends that told me that I had to see it later told me that I didn't miss much. What in the world is all the hype about with this graphic novel & movie anyway? JUNK. I also get a kick out of those who have WAAAAAAAAY over analized this movie - it cracks me up. So in a nut shell - don't waste your time or money on this Slow plot, foul mouthed TRASH. This takes the Super hero genre to a new low."
1,BORING AS HELL,"Watchmen is the worst and most boring movie I have ever seen in my life! 3 hours of pure stupidity and murder. No direction, no real plot, just a pure hate and blood movie."
1,Where is my blu ray ?,"On Sunday we bought Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]. We paid to receive the blu-ray within 6 days. On thursday, we received a phone call saying that it was too late (18pm30) and that the DVD will be given to us on friday. On friday, we didn't go working and we waited and we always wait. No phone call, no message, nothing. We bought many DVD or books on amazon.fr and we never have had any problem. It was the first -and the last- time we buy on amazon.com. It is not serious.Jealeblanc"
1,Watchmen,I ordered this Watchmen Blu-ray and looked forward to receiving it. Until today I did not receive it because I was informed that this Blu-ray is prohibited to be shipped out to me as it is R-rated. I was not warned when I placed the order. Of course I was disappointed.
1,Painful to watch,"Simply put one of the worst movies I've ever watched, I kept waiting for it to get good...IT NEVER HAPPENED"
4,Dowa Anyone know ?,"Does anyone know if the blu ray 3 disc set come with the regular dvd of the film like the disney people do,I thought I saw it in BJ.s that said it came with regulafr dvd?"
2,Please...,"One dimensional characters, a meandering plot involving numerous pointless former super-whatevers, and... I fell asleep for the rest."
1,Waste of Time,"I bought this movie on the Roger Ebert recommendation.Most movies he recommends are pretty good. I just could not feel for a bunch of wsshed up superheroes being eliminated. Hollywood is running out of ideas for movies. So they dig up some superhero comics that we never heard of, place a bunch of not well known actors, and put in a bunch of special effects. I placed in my resale pile, and hope I can at least get [...]"
1,Watchmen Sound Sync Problems,The Watchmen Blu-Ray disk will not play correctly on my Samsung BD-P3600 player. The sound and action do not sync. Yes I have the latest player firmware. Is anyone else having this problem ?
1,Psycho-babble-masochism,A great movie for the terminally depressed with a need to destroy the very genre called super-heroes. It wallows in counter-culture stereo-types. I could be wrong .. maybe it's a drug rehab thing.
1,This is not my cup of tea,This has much more violence and is not my idea of a super hero movie.There is way too much blood and guts. I am glad I missed it in the theater I wish I had not rented it.
1,Awful Movie,Hard to make a movie where superheroes suck. I don't know how they did it. Watched it in theaters and will NEVER attempt watching it again. It's just BAD!
1,The watchmen was UNWATCHABLE!,"This movie looked amazing from the trailers but turned out to be unbearable! It was just plain boring. I was actually angry at how bad this movie was. Even the actors seemed bored with this material. The dialogue in this movie will put you to sleep. This movie should have been much shorter. There are these scenes that run on and on forever! Like this one scene where Dr. Manhattan is on Mars and you basically just hear him yapping about nothing for 20 minutes. I no this is a dark comic. I was not expecting the X-men. However, i was expecting to be a little bit entertained."
1,Beyond Frustrating....,"OK, full disclosure- I have not seen the ultimate cut, but I did see the director's cut, and the inclusion of the Black Freighter animations will not change the problems I had with this film. I could go through and innumerate each of the problems, but I can sum up everything I was thinking as the credits rolled in one statement: Either Zack Snyder never actually read the Watchmen graphic novel, or if he did read it, he did not understand it."
3,Was not IN TACT!,"When I ordered the package I expected it to be in tact including the case, but when I opened it parts of the bottom of the case fell out showing broken pieces of plastic which secured the CDs. Luckily the Blu rays still worked but I expect ALL parts to be welltaken care of ESPECIALLY the case."
1,And I'm even a fan,"This was a brilliant Film. You might say the comic version of ""WAR and PEACE"". The Blu-Ray looks fantastic no SD shots slipped into the final production 100% picture perfect. So why one star you ask? The sound levels for the film are all over the place. One min the ""action"" is loud and intense. The next min you can't hear a word the actors are saying? My PS3 and receiver has a sound sink and filtration microchip set included and It didn't do squat! I SPENT 3HRS turning the volume up for the speaking parts and way down for the action sequences. This completely ruined the relaxing enjoyment of what movie watching is all about. This was a movie I was really excited about buying for my blu-ray collection, oh well now that got shot all to hell! Same with the newest version of BATMAN dark night. What in the hell is up with the weirdo crappy sound in the newer movies? Final verdict rent um before you buy um!"
1,No Black Freighter? There's no excuse!!!,"I was ready to purchase the Blu-Ray Director's Cut, but assumed it would include ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" material. It does not, thus ensuring a future release that includes it. Why do companies do this? Very disappointing - and a long wait before I will buy."
1,Waste of time!,"This movie can be summed up in one word.... SUCKED! The story line was pointless and the movie was just so dang boring! Way too many characters and story lines at one time really got me confused! I am glad I did not waste my time and blow $[...] to go see this crap in the theater. Thanks to REDBOX, I dont feel too bad about spending a [...] to rent it. But to own this movie is just a WASTE OF TIME!!!"
5,How I see it,Alot of people do not appreciate this movie for what it is. A great retelling of the greatest comic story ever written. People believe unless it is word for word translated from book to screen it is a bastardization of the original. I disagree. Zack Snyder rewrote it to suit our times. (And all he really did was rewrite the ending). I proudly hold this as one of the BEST comic book movies ever made. And any collector would be proud to own this addition in their collection.
3,wait for the bigger version,I bought this thinking it was the definitive copy of the film. I had heard rumors about a super multi disc version being released and I was waiting for that one but in searching Amazon I saw no mention of it so I bought the Blu Ray version. Opening my DVD I found a flier mentioning the Ultimate version coming out in December. Boy was I mad. I loved the film but now I feel I got robbed. I doubt now I will buy the newer version because I have this one. Beware that you are getting the version that you want.
5,I love it!,"I know that some people have been critical of the film adaptation of Watchmen. I happen to be one of the people who enjoyed it. However, I was unprepared for just how much the ultimate edition would improve the quality of the film. In reading, the black freighter was always my least favorite part. I didn't care for it. Only after seeing the movie without it, and then with it re-inserted to I really appreciate it's significance and symbolism. I strongly recommend this for any fan of Watchmen."
3,"Confusing, yes, but Kelly Leak hits it out of the park!","The first half of this movie was pretty intriguing. I don't hold it against the director for making it rather Blade Runnerish. However, by the second half, forget it! Talk about convaluted! Christ Mr. Snyder, but most of the people watching this movie were raised on MTV and video games. Give us a break! I don't think Siskel and Ebert on their best day could follow the second half!The more positive attribute is Jackie Earle Hailey's Rorschach. His performance demonstrated a perfect marriage of both the visceral AND the cerebral. THIS IS WORTHY OF AN OSCAR NOD!Just curious: Who all out there besides me thought initially that Hollis (played by Stephen McHattie) was being played by James Remar (""Ajax"" in ""The Warriors"")? I don't know if he's dead or alive, but if the latter, did casting consider him for this movie?"
4,"Not complete, but worth it","Let me just say first of all that the movie itself is awesome! This particular set of DVDs... i expected more of it in the sense that it doesn't have a 'director's commentary' of the movie or something like that.. and the extras weren't so much based on the actors/acting as it was on the connection with the comics (which i also love). Overall though, i'd buy it again (+ the hologram on the cover is really cool :)."
2,"Great features, but a very boring movie","First of all, I want to say that I looooove the graphic novel and I would recommend the book to anyone. The movie on the other hand was a bit on the boring side. I don't know quite how to explain my disappointment, but I will say this. I love Batman and I love Ironman, I know their stories from the comic books and I love the way they were portrayed on film in the last couple of years. Watchmen let me down because it was EXACTLY like the novel and there was really no reason why I should have watched it; thus, making the movie really boring because there was nothing new for me to enjoy.The Blu ray is jam packed with features that are really enjoyable and I could only recommend watching it if someone already owns this or if you're a die hard fan.I can recommend the graphic novel, but I wouldn't recommend this movie."
2,Dang It !,"I'm sorry, but this movie just wasn't that good. I found it hard to attach myself to any of the characters. There were several graphic scenes that felt forced. But, I think the overall look of the film is fantastic. The quality of the film is superb. There were some magnificent moments that I won't ever forget, but this movie was just kind of boring. Dragged out. Not fluid. To me, it seems a lot of time, money and effort was wasted. I absolutely love comic-based movies and superhero movies and big-budget movies, but I parted with this blu-ray (which is an excellent transfer, by the way)."
3,WATCHMEN NOT FOR KIDS,Special effects were good...storyline was not clear at the beginning and a bit slow..picked up at the end.Dr. Manhattan showed excessive nudity which could have been averted by having him wear trunks. Not a movie I would give to my 13 year old grandson and certainly not any child younger than that.Love scenes in the movie preclude it being seen by children as well.
1,"Eye-popping, ear-splitting... rubbish.","Wow, what a spectacle. Wow, what a sorry bunch of ""super"" losers. Not one sympathetic character in 3 excruciating, mind-numbing hours. Brilliant rubbish!!!"
1,WoW ToTaL TrAsH!!!,This is one of the worst movies I have ever wasted 2 hours on in my life...It ranks up there with Open Water..Blair Witch..really bad dont waste your time...
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,"Having thoroughly enjoyed other ""superhero"" movies like the first two xmen, the second and third spiderman, and the dark knight, and being mildy amused by the third xmen and first spiderman, I'd have to say this movie was an utter disappointment. Unoriginal, predictable characters that you can't even love to hate, minimal action, and an utterly depressing plot (if you can call it a plot)that drags on and on and on and on... this movie stinks on so many levels. Even MST3K wouldn't have been able to do anything with this stinkeroo! If 2 1/2 hours of complete torture is what you desire, then I completely recommend this movie. Otherwise run... don't walk... run away and pick up ANYTHING else! Even the Fantastic Four outshines this one!"
1,What's this stuck on my shoe?,I couldn't give less than 1 star and that makes me unhappy.I've just finished this entire 3 hour crapfest and can say it's one of the worst executed movies I've ever seen. I hated everything about this movie.Don't waste your time or money.
2,NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie is worthless it is so boring and long like the spirit even though i like DC comics this one is to watch out for. this is the worst comic movie ive seen this year
2,Ugh...,"I had really big expectations for this movie. I'm a huge sci-fi / fantasy buff, serenity, buckaroo banzai, sin city, lotr, you name it. Love em. Some camp or poor effects but a great story? I can easily handle that, but this movie...was awful. It's far to long, the back stories are painfully boring for the most part, the thrown in for no reason sex scenes were gratuitous the action scenes were bland. It was just bad. The really sad part is the actual underlying story if done well has huge potential, but someone obviously worked very very hard to make this movie awful. It would be a toss up between having a tooth pulled or being forced to watch this again."
1,Dull and borning,I do not read the comics as most people who watch comic movies. This movie very little back story and even a hour into the movie I could not figure out what the purpose of the movie was. Super heros who rape and murder? Are they even super or just people in a mask? On top of all that the violence was more for shock value then adding in to the movie. I bought this used for $[...] and still feel I over paid. I vote this a skip.
1,Disappointing after all the hype,"This action movie sins in the worst possible way - it's boring! There's no sense of fun anywhere (see 'Iron Man'), and the action sequences are dull and predictable (has no one seen the 'Kill Bill' movies? They came out years ago!). Even the acting was pretty stilted - I thought Rorschach was pretty decent, but everyone else was bland, bland, bland.I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, ""graphic novel""). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed. Maybe this movie does that for 'Watchmen' fans, I dunno. But for me, I couldn't wait for the end.(The disparity between die-hard fans and everyone else might also explain why the IMDB rating is a very high 7.9, but metacritic is significantly lower at 56)"
1,What happened?,"Although this version is ok, I was not aware that it was altered. This is not the theatrical movie i saw at the theater. It has been edited and some scenes dropped out. For me it lost a lot of the character and the drama of the movie by the editing that was done.I believe it was censored due to pressure from viewers who have issues and the releasing agency complied. Totally disappointed."
1,Don't watch Watchmen,"I'm not a fan of the graphic novel, so I was new to the entire storyline. But, after viewing the Blue Ray version of the video, I have to say, ""What was all the hype about anyway?"" Crappy plot, mediocre acting, and one blatant sex scene that couldn't have helped the movie even if it had been done well."
3,"Great Film, and Quick Delivery but there is a problem...","So I purchased the Watchmen, because I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters. The reason I am giving the product only a 3 star rating is because of the crap that WB pulled with the digital version. Now I did not buy the film for the digital version I just thought it would be a nice thing to have a copy on my computer and possibly put it on my Ipod. The problem is that if you order the copy now the digital copy has expired and the code that is used to access the copy will no longer work. So in short, Great movie, good product, crap pulled by the company"
5,Great movie and blu ray,I bought it from france coz we don't have the director's cut on the french blue ray. It's really worth to have this blu ray.
2,Don't rent from this item listing,"Just a tip not to rent from this Director's Cut listing... you'll wind up renting the theatrical version instead. As far as I know, you can't rent the Director's Cut anywhere. In general, though, I don't recommend the film.So why do I want to see the Director's Cut? I'm curious to see if the extra footage makes a difference."
3,WatchMen,The movie was OK - but the download left a bit to be desired. It was no way the quality of the DVD itself
1,FYI- Definitive version coming at X-mas,"Saw Zack Snyder on G4's comic-con coverage this weekend. He stated that a version including Black Frieghter will be coming out at Christmas. I'd avoid this until that comes out.This constant multiple releases of films has got to stop. Release the theatre version and the complete version. This version makes little sense, other than trying to gouge fans.I'm a huge watchmen fan, and I liked the version in the theatres. I'll be excited to see a complete extended version later this year...Watch the interview for yourself:[..]"
2,Not What I Expected!!!,"I'm so glad I did not buy this! I rented it, and didn't think it was all that great! There were some sweet bloody scenes, and some cool special effects, but the rest was very boring. When a superhero called The Comedian is killed, Doctor Manhattan, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Night Owl II try to figure out why. Rorscach was my favorite character because of his attitude. I really didn't like the way the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend WATCHMEN!!!"
2,Boring and well... boring,"I am a big fan of super-heroes but did not know much about DC's Watchmen. I finally bought the movie because it was on sale and was excited to finally get to see it. It was a bit of a disappointment, however. The first hour nearly had me ready to turn it off, it was so boring. I managed to make it to the ninety minute mark before giving up and honestly, I am unsure if I will try it again. Life is too short. Maybe fans of the comic will appreciate it more but it just wasn't for me."
3,No Trailers on Directors Cut,"Three stars because it is visually a really great movie, but the actors just don't do it for me, pretty emotionless the whole way through.This Blu-Ray doesn't have the trailers for the movie, the trailers were one of the best parts too. Seems odd to give a two disc set and not include that feature, it's not like they ran out of space for it."
3,Director's Cut and Blu-ray does not help movie.,"While the movie has well-written costumed vigilantes performed by above-average actors, the movie ran like a re-telling of the graphic novel verbatim. The movie itself is so long, the additions provided by the director's cut are forgettable. The last forty-five minutes are still the best part of the movie.Blu-ray helps with the visuals; but does not accentuate the storytelling. Unless you are an avid Blu-ray fan like myself, Watchmen can be viewed in regular DVD Video format."
2,Beware: NO Digital Copy. Misleading.,"I bought this product for the digital copy, but when we opened it, there's a piece of paper that says the digital copy was only available through July of 2010. That was nowhere in the description or on the outside of the box. Now I can't return it because it's opened and I feel cheated. "" + Digital Copy"" is misleading and should be removed from the description."
3,Good place to start,"I read Plan Your Estate and was somewhat pleased with what it had to offer. Then I reviewed it with my financial planner and he was very impressed with the content of the book and the depth of information available.It has been very helpful in setting up my own Will using software and has helped me document my bequests in an appropriate manner.So, in reality it was much better than I had expected it to be and better than I'd originally thought it to be."
5,Book on estate planning,"I wanted a book which would lay out the basics, and which would have information about a specific case--what happens if one's spouse is not a US citizen, and one dies--there are issues about the marital estate tax exemption and whether it applies or not. This book discusses this topic and others in a clear way."
5,C.J. and The Fish,"Country Joe and the Fish was our life savers when i was in Vietnam, Funny as heck!! of course they we banned on a lot of Radio stations because of some of their songs, Glad you still their cds. Thanks!!!!"
3,A glimpse of the past for Country Joe & The Fish fans,"Country Joe & The Fish's first two albums - ""Electric Music For The Mind And Body"" & ""I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die"" - are packed full of numbers such as ""Section 43"", ""Magoo"", ""Janis"", ""Thursday"", ""Pat's Song"", ""Bass Strings"", ""Grace"" and ""Colors For Susan"" that capture the swirling, ethereal essence of Bay area psychedelia. Their third album ""Together"" failed to deliver any more, with only ""Susan"" coming near to recreating the ""feel"" of these early tracks.By the time of CJ Fish (released in 1970) most of the band had gone, but Country Joe McDonald and lead guitarist Barry Melton manage to rekindle their original, quite unique sound on ""She's A Bird"", ""Mara"" and the superb ""Return Of Sweet Lorraine"" (psychedelia at its best) - intermingled with some enjoyable rock & roll and folk numbers, in particular, ""Sing, Sing, Sing""If you're looking to repeat the experience of their psychedelic masterpieces then here's a couple more."
2,"Not the Original band, don't waste your cash.",I'd forgotten how bad this one was. Joe is with a new band and it just doesn't work. Maybe one or two songs worth listening to.Forget it.
1,Another reviewer Agrees... REALLY BAD MOVIE,"I'll second the other reviewers here... but first let me say I have been a Full Moon fan for years... this is not only one of their worst films, but one of the worst films by any large video production company I have seen. Zero redeeming qualities... bad acting, inane script, crap directing, and heck, even bad background music. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
2,YO CLOWN! WE KNOW YOU IN HERE.,"This is a low budget African-American horror film that develops into a better franchise. Michael (Jamal Grimes) has a crush on Jada (Vera Yell), who in turn is the girlfriend of bad boy Lorenzo (William L. Johnson). Lorenzo and his gang are bullies and thugs. Michael attempts to use black magic to conjure up something called ""Killjoy"" which we know nothing about, or him as there is no character introduction.Things don't go well for Michael and we jump to a year later where the remaining cast must combat Killjoy, a magical killer clown with an ice cream truck transporter. The acting and lines were fairly bad. There is a magical homeless guy that really isn't explained. The clown was rather repulsive, and that was by design...I think.Parental guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Napiera Groves, Miss District of Columbia 1997)"
1,worst movie ever!,"this movie has to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! it is very low budget, and just about everything about it sucks and is just all around stupid and worhtless and i hate it!i admit that this movie may look interesting, but is definetely not even worth viewing. i rented both this movie and the sequel, and they both blow. the sequel is a little bit better, but still low budget and horrible. so in other words this movie is not worth watching, unless you want to laugh at how bad it is. and it IS NOT SCARY AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Just stupid -- real stupid!,"You purchase this at your own risk, but you have been warned by me and several others. This is just stupid -- real stupid. Acting is awful, script is awful, direction is awful. It's just plain awful. You have been warned."
2,"Corney, stupid, and plotless.","Killjoy is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. None of these actors could act their way out of a paper bag. The only one with any talent is the clown. I have to agree that he is a combonation of Tim Curey and Jim Carey. Yes he does get rather annoying, but so does all the useless cursing and the pointless nudity. The little nurd boy bringing a killer demon into the world to avenge him is so cliche, along with the being consumed by flames and run over with a truck. The gangster in love with the good girl made sense, but I believe a gang consists of more than three people. I think this is the worst Full Moon Pictures can do and I hope if they make any sequels for it, which they left it wide open for them, that they are better than the first one."
3,Not as bad as your think,"Yes, at times this movie doesn't make sense at times, but it's worth a look. Nice to see some Black horror movies being made for once. Plus it was a bonus to see what the guy that voiced Destro and Iceberg in GI JOe and Devastor on the Transformers. If you're wondering who that is it's Arthur Burghardt."
1,What can I say...,"That hasn't already been said? This movie manages to take what seems like a simple yet intriguing plot and turn it into a 90 minute festering pile of dog s**t (sorry to be so descriptive). The acting is extremely poor. Be sure to emphasize the extremely. The characters are moronic. A lot of the film does not make sense, for instance, towards the end of the ""movie"" when the three main stars of the film are in some sort of Satanic-Killjoy circle, one of the kids tells the others that they can't leave the circle. How the hell does he know this? It's stupid. This is horrible. And not so horrible it's good. Just horrible."
4,Third times the charm,"This is Full Moon's third entry in its urban series now known as Big City Pictures. Right off, let me say this is the best of the batch. This time they chose a 21 year old script writer who knows the street lingo and is up to date on the horror genre. The Killjoy character is a combination of Jim Carey and Tim Curry and the guy from Sgt. Kabukiman. Of course he has all the best dialogue. Beware the profanity is blunt, but isn't that what you expect in urban life. Not much in the way of extras. There is a twelve minute documentary thrown in with the trailer, but no other promos. Still, overall a great package. And if you know Full Moon, you know you will see a Killjoy puppet in stores soon!"
4,"KATANAS,BATTLE AXES,YA DA YA DA YA DA.","I'DEPPRESSED I NEED A CLOWN,BOZO NO!,RONALD NO!,KILLJOY...HELL YEAH!THIS MOVIE IS NON-STOP FAKE BLOOD & GORE FULL-MOON GOODY!"
1,What happened to the demos?,"There were 4 demos that originally were supposed to be released. But now they have vanished, with no explanation whatsoever from the label or the band. What gives? Is Eric Carmen so insecure that he refused to release something that wasn't polished and perfect? The tracks DID appear on the hits collection that never came out (except very briefly via a record club). In place of that carrot that was dangled in front of fans of the band, another collection of previously released tracks is issued again. I guess fans are expected to buy this for the cover art. Well, even that stinks. The cover art for the aborted hits collection with the demos was quite nice, however. This is altogether a really lame set of circumstances."
5,Raspberries Greatest,"This review is pretty much on the mark except, the reviewer refers to John Aleksic as being part of the band. This is a major faux pas as John left the group prior to their recording career and the bassist/rhythm guitarist is Dave Smalley. All the songs on this album feature Dave on either bass or rhythm guitar, as well as co-writer on some of the tracks."
3,it's OK,"There is only 1 song on this album I recognise, the rest are just ? questionable and never heard of or liked. Sorry."
2,Superflous Berries,"Sometimes you just wanna choke the execs up there in the Capitol tower, who have continually disappointed and ripped-off Raspberries fans with countless repackagings of the same established, reknown hits of this arguably very important group. With a couple of exceptions, this collection has been released (in nearly the exact sequencing) at least twice in the last fifteen years, and there are a number of import compilations sporting similar track listings. Furthermore, rumors of the inclusion of unreleased demos (e.g. ""I Saw The Light;"" ""Overnight Sensation"") on THIS particular release proved false. Damned if I can find a BMG copy of the 2000 compilation with the four demos; thanks again, Capitol! My rating is based on the gall of this self-absorbed record label, and not the beautiful music contained on the disc. It gets a 2 instead of a 1 only cuz they included ""I Can Remember."""
4,Good 1970s Pop-Rock,"This type of rock flew against the prevailing musical trends of the early-mid 70s. Not prog rock or metal, but concise, catchy pop songs. If you like The Raspberries and Badfinger, be sure to check out the best of them all, Big Star. #1 Record/Radio City (1972/1973) belong in every rock collection, right next to those other groups, and any others that matter at all."
2,"not what the doctor ordered, alas","Interesting, thought-provoking, sometimes even funny, but in the end, you're better off buying Kevin Kim's ""Scary Spasms in Hairy Chasms,"" which deals with the subject more humorously and less (ahem) maturely."
1,YOU CALL THIS A MOVIE????????????,"TIS IS THE WORST THING TO EVER HIT THEATERS!!!!! The plot was lame, it goes from beloved train models to a world that was good when it was in shining time station, but is so horrible now. And to top everything off, ALEC BALDWIN is in it, that totally wrecks the whole thing. I just have one more thing to say: BOO! THIS THING STINKS!"
3,WHAT!!!!!!!!!????????,"The Island of sodor is real. But in this movie the island is ''Magical And full of wonder'' PLLLLHHHHH. I just thought that it WAS an island of the coast of England. I own this and only Watch it Occasionally. IT does not even have much island of sodor.It just Mostly Has an 'Adult' Cast. My favorate engine Charactars (including thomas) did not even take up half the movie.It Doesn't even have bill,ben,edward,mavis,boco,Stuart,duke,Etc. Overall Movie is half good and half bad. Only buy it for people who like 'adult themed' movies."
2,"I rented this video, and want my 0.49 cents back!","This video was a great disappointment for my 4 year old Thomas fan. Mommy, what was the point?Exactly. There didn't seem to be a very clear connection between the Conductor and his Cousin who used up all their golddust and Thomas and the Island of Sodor. So these two have used up all their gold dust, and when it's gone, can no longer connect the world of England with the world of Thomas. Why should Thomas care? Why do they need ""Cus"" and ""Mr. C"" in the first place?A very slow moving movie with no real point.The annimation of Thomas and his friends is very nice, well done, and of the quality one expects with Thomas."
3,scratched,This movie was scratched pretty badly. It got to the last few minutes of the movie and froze. I tried it on several different dvd players thinking it was just mine and it did the same thing at the same part if the movie. I guess that's what I get for buying used....
4,Cheesy!,"This movie is as cheesy as anything I've seen in my life! That being said, my 3 year old can't get enough of it. Its everything we've come to expect from Thomas--great values & a happy ending. Thomas fans who are kids will love this movie. Alec Baldwin is great and convicing as Mr. Conductor."
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could,"I was appalled at how horrible this movie was! My daughter loves Thomas (and so do I) and she has all the videos of the series. We were really looking forward to the release of this movie in the theater. WHAT A LET DOWN!! This movie seemed like it was written as they shot it, (suddenly they need a well, and by gosh there it IS! Funny how it wasn't there in previous shots!) and Peter Fonda goes through this movie as if he's embarrassed to be seen in it (and with good reason!) You get the impression that he was hoping his costume called for a paper bag to put over his head! This movie was a real stinker! BLAH!"
2,How can something kids love so much be SO BAD?!,"My 2-year-old loves this movie, and subjects us to it once a day. Normally I can overlook the bad parts of a child-oriented movie, but this one has SO MANY! I think the reason is has struck such a bad cord with me is that the other Thomas videos are so GOOD! I really have to say that Peter Fonda's performance in this move was just plain HORRIBLE! I mean, really, just BAD! The plot was terrible, and the cast (other than Baldwin, who tried really hard) held all the charm of manequins.For a 2-year-old child, this movie is fine. However, if you're a parent who will be forced to watch this move OVER and OVER and OVER again, PASS ON IT!"
4,My kid adores this!,"My son just loves Thomas the Tank Engine, and he practically has this one memorized. Because all of the engines refer to Alec Baldwin as ""Mr. Conductor,"" he's always called this ""Mr. Conductor"" instead of ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"". :)"
2,Forget it,"A mishmash of a movie, with too many subplots that don't seem to get tied up at the end. Just didn't make sense to me. Nor to my 5-year-old grandson, who spent most of the movie patiently waiting for the magic railroad to appear."
3,difficult to assemble,It's very difficult to assemble since the information provided is not enough. You have to try different combinations to get it right. They should have some coding on each track as to where it goes with the towers. Once assembled it works fine
3,"Good for Thomas fans...otherwise, pass","My son,who is 2, loved this movie (which we rented first), but mainly because he is crazy about Thomas. My daughter, who is 8, always enjoyed the Shining Time Station show, which used to play on PBS. She also enjoyed the movie, but thought it was (in her words, ""kinda cheesy!"" The story is sort of ridiculous, and I wondered how they got Peter Fonda and Alec Baldwin to sign on for this, but since my son loves it so much, I have to give a 3 star rating. It does keep the kids enthralled, and there is enough of the train parts, (not the live actor parts), to keep my son from getting bored. All in all, I would say, that if your child is a big fan of Thomas, the movie is a must-have."
2,Not enough Thomas,Nothing against the seller but this is not at all what I expected. Too much live action and the plot is just goofy. There was not enough train footage. It was a little bit depressing too. Clearly not like the cheerful TV shows.
2,The voices are the best actors,The acting in this movie is horrible! The best parts are played by the trains them selves. My son loves the movie but is only 3 and only sees Thomas. The story is okay and I like that they use the original look of Thomas but that's the only good points of the entire movie.
5,"Excellent, one of a kind family film!","I can't say enough positive things about this awesome film that unlike many other popular children's movies, the whole family will enjoy. My 4 year old daughter loves it (almost as much as I do) and so do her friends. This live action film has all of the magic of Thomas and the Island of Sodor complemented by charming performances by Peter Fonda, Alec Baldwin and other top notch actors. My husband and I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite gifts to give. We miss riding the trains on the northeast corridor. This film brings some familiar sights and sounds into our home."
2,This movie is unwatchable ...,"except, apparently, if you are a 3-year-old boy. But my son's taste has always been a little suspect. He also likes the My Little Pony book his grandmother was suckered into buying him at the drug store. Ick. However, I'm giving the movie two stars because it got us through several plane trips (along with Babe, which is a fabulous movie) on a portable DVD player. Gotta love technology. I haven't gotten through the whole film yet, so I suppose I should reserve judgment. But what I have seen borders on absurdist theater. It makes little sense and appears to be one non sequitur after another. I love that Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda signed up for this one. Though, it might be Peter Fonda's best work yet."
1,Even if this film were FREE it wouldn't be worth it!!!,This has to be one of the worst films ever made! Painfully bad. No plot. Some of the worst direction and acting! This doesn't have anything to do with the UK or Americanized version of the BBC/PBS series.
3,What?,"As an adult I would like to write a horrible review of this movie, but for some reason my kids like it. This was the reason I bought the DVD, but man this is hard for a grown up to sit through!"
3,"Painful to watch, but my son loves it...","I have no idea what happened to Peter Fonda in this movie, but I swear he couldn't have been worse if he was reading cue cards the entire time. The story lines are difficult to follow, and make no sense. BUT my soon to be 3 year old Thomas fanatic LOVES this movie, and much to my chagrin, requests it quite often."
2,Mara wilson. 4th may 2004.,"By looking on the advertisements, it looked fairly good. Mostly wanted it cos mara wilson was in it, i like her films, she is a good actress. I don't think it is amusing for any older kid, after watching it myself i know that older kids might get a bit bored of it. Not just for those who just like thomas the tank engine, it is kind of an adventure too. People who don't like thomas might absolutely hate this film, for me there is too much talking trains and it is great for an ill kid,especcially young ones."
1,Really useless movie,"Awful; a disgrace to the Thomas tradition. Poor Rev. Awdry, the late author of the original corpus of Thomas books, would not be pleased by this disastrous new creation. Thomas the T.E. is a wonderful creation, and I have greatly enjoyed the other videos produced by Britt Alcroft, but this turkey is a disaster.The plot was incomprehensible. Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda gamely delivered their moronic lines. For some reason, Peter Fonda seemed to be chronically depressed. I'd like to say that the script seemed as if it had been produced by a committee of illiterate schizophrenics, but that would be an insult to schizophrenics.My 3 year old son loved it. Although he only saw it once (in the movie theater) he continues to talk about it."
1,Terrible - Save your money!,"Worst Thomas movie we have seen. My kids were yawning after 5 minutes and did not even make it through the first half. And of course communist Alec Baldwin is horrible, what a loser."
2,bizarre,"I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here. This movie is so unlike any other Thomas movie. My husband and I laugh at the acting and the storyline...it's horrible. However, my son loves it. So be prepared. If you want something your kid will like to watch...get it...but beware, you will want to poke your own eyes out."
4,some very scary scenes for your toddler,"Like all Thomas videos the characters do not model the best behaviours and Diesel 10 in this one is particularly scary. At least, other than the villains they seem to have made the behaviour of the characters milder and more pleasant. I give it a four since I can sit throught this one with my son -- more of a semblance of plot and so on. We usually end up using the sing-along portion of the video. So *do* buy it on DVD."
1,Tremendous disappointment for Thomas fans,"My 3-year-old daughter adores Thomas, as do her mother and I. We looked forward to this movie for months, but were all tremendously disappointed. Instead of seeing an entertaining Thomas adventure, we saw a film with a confused plot involving a parallel world in which a very depressing Peter Fonda was featured. Even in the Island of Sodor scenes, the Thomas action took a back seat to miniature conductors and magic gold dust.This may have been entertaining to some, but was grossly out of touch with the elegance of the original stories. The Thomas mania is due to the charm of Thomas and his friends, not the bizarre magical Shining Time Station. The makers of this film forgot what made millions of children adore the Thomas stories."
2,Not like the original--at ALL!!!!!!,"Although I understand the story all right, it looks like it would be confusing to very young children considering that it needs gold dust to get into the Island of Sodor. Compared to the original Thomas, this is a horrible movie. If you are considering getting it, I recommend that you get one of the original Thomas videos because I believe your child will enjoy that much more. Although some kids may like it, I personally don't like it at all. It takes ideas away from the original Thomases and it has real people which makes them become the stars and not the trains. The Diesel 10 guy wants to bite up all the steams engines with his pincher claw--and that would be scary to little kids."
2,Alec Flips the Bird!! No one ever noticed before?,"Alec baldwin, while in the jaws of the diesel bully, in a close up of his hand grapping for his cutters, very clearly flips everyone the bird. He extends his middle finger in reaching for the tool, and pauses a second. I'd go so far as to call it flagrant. Of course, my two year old has no idea what it means, but I had a good laugh. I wonder though, what older kids (and their parents) might think?Anyway, my son loves Thomas, and loved the movie. I thought there were so many holes in the plot that you could drive several steam engines through them side by side. I actually found the plot difficult to follow at times. There are many better kids movies than this."
5,My son loved it!,"My son recieved this for his birthday since everything was Thomas this year. My assistant had it for her grandsons and thought my son would love it. Well she was SO right! I've had to listen to it about a million times, but that's why he now has a DVD player in his room! When he's not in the mood for the other 800 Thomas movies he has he tells me he wants the ""real live"" one. Took me a while to figure out he meant this one, but he loves it and like I said before that's all that matters to my husband and I."
1,Should be zero stars,"Honest - I think this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I agree with the previous reviewer: kids who are young enough to be interested in Thomas won't sit still for the live-action scenes. And an adult who doesn't mind watching a typical Thomas video with a child will find this movie just excruciating. The ""plot"" is extremely tedious, and the acting is just plain awful. I have no idea why Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda took these roles unless (1) they never read the script or (2) somebody backed a truckload of money up to their door. I would have rated it a zero if I could. Just plain bad. Don't waste your money."
2,Very scarey,"I bought this for my son cause I heard it was good and he loves Thomas. I also wanted to introduce him to new trains. Well, as soon as Diesel 10 came on the screen, my son was screaming and crying cause he was so scared of him. That night he wouldn't go to sleep by himself either. I have put it away for now. I'm getting him the trains, including diesel 10 so maybe he won't be so scared of him when he see him next. He was enjoying the movie until he was scared."
2,Not like the original Thomas--at ALL!!!!!!!,"Written by Dan Nelson age 10 (2002)Although I understand the story all right, it looks like it would be confusing to very young children considering that it needs gold dust to get into the Island of Sodor. Compared to the original Thomas, this is a horrible movie. If you are considering getting it, I recommend that you get one of the original Thomas videos because I believe your child will enjoy that much more. Although some kids may like it, I personally don't like it at all. It takes ideas away from the original Thomases and it has real people which makes them become the stars and not the trains. The Diesel 10 guy wants to bite up all the steams engines with his pincher claw--and that would be scary to little kids."
2,How can something kids love so much be SO BAD?!,"My 2-year-old loves this movie, and subjects us to it once a day. Normally I can overlook the bad parts of a child-oriented movie, but this one has SO MANY! I think the reason is has struck such a bad cord with me is that the other Thomas videos are so GOOD! I really have to say that Peter Fonda's performance in this move was just plain HORRIBLE! I mean, really, just BAD! The plot was terrible, and the cast (other than Baldwin, who tried really hard) held all the charm of manequins.For 2-year-old child, this movie is fine. However, if you're a parent who will be forced to watch this move OVER and OVER and OVER again, PASS ON IT!"
3,Great for Thomas fans only,"I just purchased this video for my son's 3rd B-day as he is a Thomas junkie. He absolutely loves it. It has been the number one request for the last month. He really enjoys acting out the scenes from the movie with his trains. However, I wouldn't recommend it for older children unless they are Thomas fans. The plot is pretty bad with very choppy story telling. The acting is even worse. I've watched is quite a few times with him and I can't help feeling that they just didn't even bother trying to write a coherent script. I keep picturing the writers going ""ah, it's for a bunch of kids, who cares"". So, definately buy it for your Thomas fans but not as an introduction to Thomas for an older child. Thomas the Tank Engine is an absolutely wonderful world for children to play and learn in, I would hate to turn a discriminating child off by watching this first."
3,Great for your toddler.,"I am thirty years old, but I really do enjoy watching the animated Thomas and Friends videos with my three year old son. This video however, was more difficult for me to get into and hasn't grown on me over time. Now the animated scenes are delightful as usual, but when the film goes to the live-action scenes, things begin to deteriorate. Most of the acting is sub-par, especially Fonda and Means, although Baldwin does act enthusiastic in his role as ""Mr. Conductor."" There are also some areas of the film where the storyline seems disjuncted, hopping about without a clear line of progression. There are also a few scenes that can be frightening to very young children. My son seldom fails to hop on my lap when the ""Bad Engine,"" as he calls it, appears on the screen.Recommended for your diehard three year-old Thomas fan."
1,Just really bad despite Alec Baldwin's best efforts,"Alec Baldwin is the only bright spot in this dog. Well, okay, the trains are good, too, but there are far too little of them in the movie. Peter Fonda is just awful, and the plot is truly befuddling. Of course, my 3-year-old loves this movie so I'm forced to watch it a couple of times a month. It took several viewings for me to figure out that the Conductor and his cousin were Lilliputian unless they were on Sodor. What happened to Tasha? And what about that little bluebird? Why not make it turn into a real bird at the end? Don't let your kids watch this--they might like it and then you'll be stuck with it. The Best of Thomas is a much better choice!"
3,"""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder""","If you are a 2 year old, chances are you will love this movie.Unfortunately, the movie's script is awful. The acting is bad, but to be fair I'm not sure how much of this is due to poor direction/script writing? Consequently, as an adult you will most likely find this flick very annoying (unless of course you value the ""quite time"" from your child being glued to the screen).The 3 stars is reflective of this mixed review, perhaps a more accurate rating would be 1 star for adults and 4 stars for young children."
1,Not for kids used to the TV series,"This movie is quite a departure from the TV series. What is all this magic railroad stuff? Too scary, too much of an exercise in 'that sounds good, let's put it in the movie'. Stick with the TV series........"
1,Inane and unwatchable,"My 3 and 4 year olds are devoted to Thomas, and we counted down the days till this video came out. Peter Fonda gives an abysmal performance, Mara Wilson is insolent, and the entire film is unbearably confusing. We saw this film three times in the Theatre until I revolted and refused to sit through it again unless I could bring along a book and a booklight. It is unabashadly horrible and I would avoid it at all costs. Do not allow it into your homes."
1,Definition of tedious,"The print version of the story hardly makes sense and this film even less so. Esp with Peter Fonda and Alec Baldwin popping up randomly and endless mentions of ""gold dust"", the movie is like a really rotten drug trip. The only way I could enjoy this mess would be on MST 3K. Misery in a box."
2,The trains were cute but this movie's awful,"For some reason I can't fathom my daughters love this movie, but sitting through it is painful. The little boy in the movie should consider another career, and Peter Fonda is more wooden than the trains (although if you're in the right mood his performance is almost funny, but mostly it's just painful). Alex Baldwin tried, but the script and the direction kept this movie from being anything more than dismal. The Thomas series is much more entertaining and well-written. Do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this dog."
2,OK for a 2-year-old (but that's it),"First, the positives: my two-year-old son who is a major Thomas fan absolutely LOVES this film! It's a cute little film for little kids. If you're an adult, however, get ready to be confused and disappointed. The plot is virtually non-existant and the direction is poor. Conductor (Alec Baldwin) is far too over-the-top in his role, while Grandpa Stone (Peter Fonda) is so depressed I don't think even prozac could help. Most of the numerous other ""live"" characters that pop up (Billy, Patch, Stacy Jones, etc.) serve only to confuse the story. Thomas and the other trains actually seem to take a second-hand role, being supplanted by all the ""sparkle"". This film is definitely NOT in the same class as the Thomas Videos which are gems- So why did I give it two stars and not one? Because my son likes it and that must count for something."
3,"Our toddler loves it, we hate it.","This has to be the most poorly acted movie ever made...but my 2.5 year old loves it so much that I'm now buying a second copy because the first one is that worn out. I do whatever I can to talk him out of watching this because everything about it makes my skin crawl but it's his go-to favorite 50% of the time. It almost literally hurts to have to sit through it!I gave it a 3 as an average because my son would say it's a 5 and I would say it's less than a 1, so that's how I decided on 3."
2,Mixed from our household,"Took my kids to see this at the theater when it was first out. Of course we had to see it, my son has been a huge Thomas fan for 12 years. Both he and my 10-year-old daughter loved the film, though we were all disappointed that the familiar music themes had been abandoned for this movie. I wasn't particularly disappointed with the film, as I had expected it wouldn't prove to be as magical as the ""real"" Thomas videos are. I was amazed at what a poor actor Peter Fonda showed to be in this role. Oh my! He and the young boy both seemed to be so stilted. Thank goodness for Baldwin as Mr. Conductor, the guy in the Mr. C Junior role, and Mara Wilson for bringing some energy to their roles."
5,What is with the 1 stars on this movie???,"My 19 month old loves this movie. We have watched it over 100 times. I bought another Thomas the Train dvd and my son didn't make it through the first 2 minutes. This has real trains in it, plus actual people in it. I like watching this better than all the Elmo movies!!"
4,Good for Toddler Thomas Fans,"My toddler loves this movie. Don't get me wrong--the negative reviews on this site are not incorrect. There isn't as much train action as in other Thomas flicks, and the human acting isn't very good. I think Alec Baldwin is great, but Peter Fonda sleepwalks through the movie, just collecting his paycheck, and the kids look like they're reading their lines straight from the cards. Still, the music is catchy for toddlers and the storyline is straightforward and uplifting for kids."
2,...could have been a lot better........,"Right off the bat I have a complaint- It is absolutly stupid that the title character gets only what can be best refered to as a cameo.Are kids really going to like that? Get a clue. I didn't see any improvements over the TV program, either... IS IT SO HARD TO ANIMATE A TRAIN'S MOUTH!?!? The acting is just so-so. It looks like the actors sleepwalked through this, in paticular, Peter Fonda. Not to mention the villain- an odd looking bulldozer whachamahoozet. It's painfully obvious that, unlike the other wheeled characters, ""Diesel 10"" has no prototype. All in all a halfhearted atempt at a family flick that could have been dramatically better."
1,Thomas has lost his touch,"Well, two of my cousins saw this movie and enjoyed it because they like anything to do with Thomas. Well, I saw it on video and I was disappointed. I think Thomas and Barney are the worst film and TV characters on this planet. Even worse, this film had an utterly vague concept, and I couldn't even follow it and I'm 11 years old! Even worse, it has corny lines. This film nearly destroyed my intellegence! I will NEVER EVER SEE ANOTHER G-RATED FILM AGAIN! TAKE YOUR TODDLER TO GO SEE THE MATRIX!"
2,Why on earth does he like it?,"OK, I am a huge Thomas fan. (So is my 3-year-old son, but I am the one writing.) I had heard this was a horrid movie, but we were going on a long trip and I had to get a new movie for him to watch. He spotted this and there was no convincing him otherwise.It's as if they all took acid when they put this together. I agree - the plot is hard to follow and the acting, well, STINKS! Peter Fonda looks as if he took Valium the whole time. Perhaps he did - it might have made it more bearable for him.I will say this - my son loves watching this, but I am convinced his taste is suspended in order to enjoy the temporary ""demise"" of Diesel 10. If not, I have no hope for his future in the creative arts.Buy the new Thomas movie. It's not great, but at least it's close to what we all know and love. If you are forced to watch this one, you might want a beer or two handy( - and a designated parent within earshot.)"
1,Waste of time,"We bought this for my 3 year old who is a Thomas fanatic. He can't even sit through this boring embarrassment of a movie. Apparently the writers took two different (bad) scripts, shuffled them together randomly and made a film from the results. I would have to use that same adjective: embarrassing, to describe the acting job of Alec Baldwin & Peter Fonda. The storyline is hard to follow, even for my older kids and the adults who have suffered through it.Thank the gods it wasn't JUST a mediocre film; then I'd have to sit through it over and over with my son. But since he didn't even like it the first time I doubt I'll be asked to ""play Thomas again."""
3,Worst movie ever...but the kids love it anyway!,"I inwardly groan whenever my kids ask to watch this movie. But while my husband and I don't like it, I'm giving it 3 stars because my kids LOVE it and let's face it, we're buying this for our kids, not us. My 3-year old son wants to watch this movie again and again. He's even been known to sleep with the DVD at night!"
4,For the Love of Thomas,"We first viewed this movie by renting it. My 2- (almost 3-)year-old was petrified by Diesel 10. We had to turn the movie off until he went to bed so our 4-year-old could watch it. After reading the stories of the Magic Railroad and playing with the Diesel 10 and Lady toys, our 2-year-old is insisting we buy this for his birthday. I think Diesel 10 is a little frightening for younger children, but it is a refreshing change for mom and dad to have more than just animation in it. And mom doesn't mind Alec Baldwin either!! The movie does show how bullying does not get you anywhere, so it is a movie we like to watch to also teach our children something valuable. Thomas Rules!"
1,This movie stinks,"This movie stinks. The story stinks, the writing stinks, and the characters stink. The Thomas stories, while presenting conflict, are essentially good natured, but the villain in this one was so scary that my toddler ran out of the room when it came on. My toddler loves to play with his trains and can't get enough of the ""Thomas"" videos, but this movie was a complete failure. Go with the story collections: they're short, but they're not scary."
2,A MOVIE!!!!! MAKE ME GAG A LITTLE,"I use to watch this show every Sunday morning ever since I was very little now I'm 14 and when I watched this movie it was very disapointing the person who did Frenchy on Grease on this hasn't changed a bit since I watched this on t.v. when I was little Mara Wilson is one of my favorite actors but I don't like her in this I liked her in Miracle on 34th Street,Matilda, Balloon Farm and a Simple Wish this one is just disapointing it may be okay if you were 6 or 1 but not for teenagers like me. you can get this for your 6 or 1 yr old but not for teens like me."
5,Keeps em' Occupied!,I love this CD and so does my 3 year old who's a big Thomas fan. This is an excellent buy.
4,"Efficient, fast-paced, and well written","Norton weaves another fine adventure, with gem specialist Murdoc Jern and mutant Eet at the center. They are brought together by chance, and work together to survive when Murdoc is pursued by the Thieves' Guild and the Patrol. Murdoc possesses a mysterious gem stone, called the Zero Stone by his murdered father, so named because of what is known about the stone - virtually nothing. The source of the stone is sought by the Guild and the Patrol, who suspect Murdoc has information to assist them. The adventure is well told and imaginative, and the story is a fast and very enjoyable read. This is another example of competent science fiction by Norton, who can turn almost any story material into something special."
4,joe's review,"Shani and her friends decide to go on a weekend adventure to Mexico. Cute boys make the girls nervous. Many secrets are revealed when they find things such as guns, knifes, and stories. More secrets keep popping up out of no where until Shani puts the pieces together. The terror lasted till the weekend was out. When they got home they decided to never go on another vacation because of what they had went through on this vacation. I liked the book very well."
3,A weekend of sun and fun OR one of terror!,"The weekend in Mexico sounded like a dream vacation for the high schoolers.There 4 guys and 5 girls and a gorgeous oceanside mansion all to themselves,Except that someone had an axe to grind. Someone wanted revenge. Who in this group of friends really wanted venegance?The story was well written in that it was meant for the teenaged reader.The characters were well developed in that you came to admire Lena. She was a ball buster but she loved her sister and would do anything to protect her. You see some of the characters grow and come of age. realizing high school is over with and you are responsible for your actions no matter how bad you may feel for how they turned out.On that note, the story was predictable. You already had an idea of who did what and which guy would end up with which girl.It is a good read and over before you know it.I read this back in 1986. It was an excellent book by the standards then."
4,A Weekend Of Vengeance,"Saturday they were working on their tans. By Sunday they were working on staying alive.A group of high-school friends arrive at a seaside mansion in Mexico for a weekend of fun. Beyond friendship, they all have something in common - nearly a year before classmate Robin was poisoned at a party, and now slowly wastes away from kidney failure. None want to believe this act was intentional, but someone does. Is it Robin's sister Lena, who arranged the weekend? The mysterious Flynn? Or is someone desperate to keep a secret buried?Weekend is a great thriller that hauls the reader through a nicely crafted maze to an excellent finish. The epilogue, which is a bit sappy, could have been left out. But in a young adult novel perhaps it was necessary to mollify any complaints about realistic portrayals of what teens do when left to their own devices."
1,Be careful what your kids are reading,"We would give this zero stars if we could. Our 12 year old checked this out of the library because he likes reading scary stories. My wife and I decided to read it also, and we were shocked. Don't let your children read this book if you are concerned about teaching them good moral values. The characters in the book are not well developed and are not realistic. They promote casual sexual relations, and are obsessed with sex. We certainly don't want our child being deceived by the garbage being pushed by Christopher Pike and Scholastic Books, which we previously trusted to publish good childrens literature."
5,"Edggie, Capturing, and Mysterious","A must read! In this book 9 friends go on a vacation in Mexico but once they are there it ends up to be a nighmare where they have to relive a horror to find out the truth about who poisoned one of their friends,Robin, who is about to die. You really have to read this book! Its my personal favorite and ever since I read it Ive been addicted to Pikes novels!"
4,A mysterious thriller that pulls you into its twisted plot.,Being the first time for me to read a Christopher Pike book I found Weekend to be a mysterious thriller that I just could not put down. Pike created a plot that pulled me into the story. I felt as if I was one of the characters going through the same deadly experience
5,Deserves more than JUST 5 STARS.,"Christopher Pike pulls you into the world where a girl was poisoned by a friend. You are feeling for her the whole time. The main character was so real and such a great person. Pike does another AMAZING job. Read it, its great."
4,"Hard, Dark, Scary","The tracks are menacing and rough with enough kick-beats and crazy samples to make your head freak. The mixing style is in-your-face and to the point, which complements the angry tracks. Tracks 14-20 are headbangers and overdose-freakout oriented. This CD isn't made for college-clubby or rave-social... The CD takes you up and and keeps you up. The techno-like depth of the tracks will keep you replaying too."
1,"Bad, does not work with the new nokia phones","This charger is for the old models. The pin is big - the older models of nokia used to have it. The new ones have a slim pin and this does not work with my model. As soon as I figured that, I put it in trash."
3,Mainly for Eiseley enthusiasts,"While I think this is a very good book, I would not recommend it to someone who has not read much of Eiseley's work. There are fabulous essays in this volume; on the other hand, some are not so good and some are unfinished. If you want to get acquainted with Eiseley's work I'd recommend ""The Star Thrower"" before you read anything else. If you become a real Eiseley enthusiast, then this book will be worthwhile to you."
5,Great 80's compilation,"I've been collecting the Rhino New Wave Hits series, which is great, but after stumbling across the Sedated series I have to say it's superior. There are fewer CDs in the Sedated series so the selections on each CD are a bit more focussed. This first volume has a great representation of the best of the era - you get the fun lite stuff like Mexican Radio and the Go-Gos, along with more artsy cuts such as Romeo Void and The Smithereens. Classics like the Ramones I Wanna be Sedated and People who Died. Really just a very enjoyable CD to listen to again and again. I look forward to adding more of this series to my collection."
2,BUYER BEWARE - RECONDITIONED UNITS not new !!,"For a used, reconditioned unit, it's a mighty fine saw. Too bad it was advertised as new, and too bad there is no mentioned of ""reconditioned"" except when it arrives on the doorstep in a box marked ""reconditioned"" and you see the wear & tear on the unit.So, BUYER BEWARE ! Amazon is not selling a new unit. These are old, used, good condition reconditioned saws, which are fine, but worth $$$ less than Amazon is selling them for....USED ..... RECONDITIONED ..... NOT NEW !!!POORLY SHIPPED ! The very heavy saw was just thrown into a big box with a bunch of air filled packing cushions. It is no wonder that many people have noted damage to their saws in the other reviews. So, again, WARNING WARNING BUYER BEWARE !!!And AMAZON, I thought your standards were higher."
5,WOW!!!,"I have thousands of dollars worth of tools, barely fit in my ton-and-a-half Dodge. But, wow, this is really nice. I removed it from the box and started to set it up. The booklet was weak, but I've done it before with other tools so I wasn't worried. Nope. Nothing to do. The blade was square and plumb as was the bevel as was the miter. Every nut and bolt was tight. Right out of the box it was fully set up and perfect. Perfect. I've never bothered to do this kind of thing before, but Makita done good. Jim.PS No, I do not work for anyone but me."
1,Good for a used saw that was suppose to be new!,"Ordered this saw from Amazon.com UPS showed up and unloaded the box. Box had clearly been opened, and retaped. I looked in the box and the saw was there and looked new, but upon inspection later it was clearly a used saw. The blade had small wood chips in it and the plastic guides on the table had tooth marks in them, as well as the channel below in the base had tooth marks. There was fine sawdust in the oil of the dual glide rods as well. The accessories were just laying on the bottom of the box along with the factory staples that were originally used to staple the box shut. There was no parts-list which is typical there and there was no plastic bag that usually covers new products. I am not sure why amazon is sending used equipment, but buyer should beware."
1,broken,"When the UPS man delivered my saw, I asked him why the box had been opened. The staples holding the box together were popped, and he had taped the box shut. When I unpacked the saw, I saw that the rear handle that locks the slide was smashed, and the saw was unusable. I have sent for a replacement."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD BOOKS,"When I was a little girl, and my father would take me to the local public library to pick out a book to read, I always picked Corduroy Bear.My father would always in effect say, ""you pick this book all of the time; is there anything else you want to read?""My answer was no. As an adult I purchased this book, not only because I loved it so much as child, but because of the fond memories of holding my father's hand as we would up the local public library's steps. My father was special and I miss him. He worked two jobs, but was never too tired to spend quality time with me.When Corduroy Bear was not available, I would pick out a Jack Ezra Keats book (e.g., Hi, Cat, Peter's Chair, The Snowy Day, Whistle for Willie etc.)"
3,Cute!,I love this book but it takes a lot to get my almost 2 year old to sit down throughout the whole thing.
4,Childhood classic,"I grew up with this book and had to order it so I could see it again. The story is simple and sweet, as are the illustrations. Tugs at the heartstrings: I recommend to anyone who has a heart or wants to have one. :-)"
5,A classic loved by children and parents,A wonderful story for older preschoolers - a great gift accompanied by a teddy bear
4,"Charming, Gentle Tale","My 2 1/2-year-old son loves this sweet, gentle story -- as do I. It's great in that the characters aren't all cookie-cutter children's characters. The little girl lives in an apartment in the city, the mother initially rejects the teddy bear because he's missing a button in the store, etc. If it's possible for a book to be both realistic AND whimsical, this one did it."
2,Fine,I was a little disappointed because I thought the bear was going to be bigger. The book was nice though.
2,Big idea; Small book,This book is a classic. My daughter remembered it from when she was little and was excited to get a copy to read to her little girl. I was disappointed with the physical size of the book. It was about 1/2 the size of the copy I had years ago!
4,great gift for a little one,I was very pleased with the book and bear. It was a great gift for my little one and the bear is small enough for her to hold when I read her the book.
5,A timeless classic,"It's hard to pinpoint exactly why Corduroy is such a beautiful book; its story is simple, its illustrations are pretty and its premise is good. Taken individually, none of these elements are strong enough to put this story over the top. Put them all together, though, and you've got a great book that kids will return to again and again.What I remember most about this book is the sweet, honest, slightly battered teddy bear who longs for a home. Although he lives in a grand shopping center filled with fabulous wealth, this is no substitute for the warmth and affection of a mother. When Lisa empties her piggy bank and takes Corduroy home, you feel happy for them both. I like this story because it stresses the importance of not only receiving love, but giving it. Kids want to do both."
5,Review,Corduroy and his book were very cute. My son loves it! It shipped quickly and it is very cute. Corduroy is his favorite.
4,Perfect sized gift set for toddler,"I bought this set for my niece who just turned 5 in hopes that she would enjoy this as a bedtime story and be able to take Corduroy to bed with her. She LOVES this story and Corduroy sleeps with her every night. The bear is small to me, but perfect sized for a toddler! This story is a classic! I definitely recommend this set for any child!"
4,Very Cute,This story is a great one to read to a little girl because it talks about her wanting a teddy bear and we all know that little girls love teddy bears. I think the pictures in this story are great because they are very detailed and very realistic. As a little girl I loved this book alot because I thought the bead was adorable. I think any young girl anywhere from ages 4 to 10 would love it. I would highly reccomend it to them because I know they would enjoy the wonderful story and exzilirating pictures!
2,typos,"Anyone notice the poor editing? On the second illustration, the passage reads: ""...but no one ever seemed to want to small bear in green overalls."" Then on the next page, a passage reads: ""Not today, dear. Here mother sighed."" The story reads well and the drawings are great. But this could not have been there for 40 years."
5,just as i remember,we read this to our 10 m old when we were flying to india and she liked the matching doll
5,Great book!,I recommend this Corduroy book and bear to any toddler and child. My son loves to hold the soft Corduroy bear while we read the story.
5,A home is not complete without Corduroy!,"This book is simply one of the sweetest books available. I carried the memory of this book with me all while growing it has a lovely lesson of kindness with the reminder to not overlook things just cause their imperfect. So when I finally became a mother and set out on my quest to find the best books available for toddlers I revisited ""Corduroy"" and just seeing my daughters face as she snuggled up to her own teddy bear captivated, I simply fell in love all over again with the story. Don't pass this book by!"
5,Great Gift,The bear is very small. My nephew really liked the bear and of course this is a classic book. No problems.
4,A Very Sweet Story,"This is a very nice story of a teddy bear in a store who has a missing button and goes off in the middle of the night to find it. It's a very simple story that really any age child can understand, and the illustrations have that feel of the 60s, at least to me which makes it charming. It's not too long, or too short, so it's the perfect bed time read for my 2 year old. I also liked that the human characters appear to be African-American which is not something you find too easily in most children's books. Overall, this is a classic and one that will be around for awhile and won't be outgrown."
4,"Collector's item/memorabilia for adults, pages upside down","I purchased this for my son, but I'm going to get another copy that ISN'T the anniversary addition. This version contains eight pages of information about the earlier version of the book, letters between the author and publisher, etc. This sort of stuff is more for those of us who remember the book from our childhoods than it is for the kids themselves.Curiously, the first four pages of my copy of the book are bound in upside-down. Does anyone else have this in theirs? I might have a real collector's item indeed...As for the story itself, it's a five-star kid's story. Wonderful. But if you are buying it for your kids, I'd get the other version."
3,but corduroy is so small!,"This is a fine product--except corduroy is so small. I guess maybe I didn't read the description too well. However, for 10.00 I guess I couldn't have received a a big plush stuffed animal and a nice hardcover book as well!! I would recommend it, but just beware that corduroy is like 4 inches tall and 3 inches wide approx, and for a real enthusiast, I would buy a cheaper book, and a larger bear!! Especially for a child who wants to actually play with their toys--I don't see this bear holding up too well, unless he's on a shelf."
4,An oldie to be loved all over again by the next generation,"I bought this book for my grandson (8 mths old) as his dad had loved it when he was a boy and we had a teddy who wore overalls who we called Corduroy in honour of the little bear in the book. Even though the clothing of the little girl who rescues Corduroy from the shop is very dated, the story line is classic and my granddaughter of 2 and a half loved me reading it to her so obviously children don't take any notice of things like that. Because I love small bears as much as books I felt it was a bonus to get bear and book together. Recommended as an oldie but a goodie!"
4,Good book,"I remember reading these books as a kid, so I wanted to get it for my son. It has been really nice to have it in the board book format so I don't have to worry about him ripping the pages. However, there are a few too many words on the pages and the pictures are a little too complex for him to really like it yet. (he's 10 months now) Hopefully he'll enjoy it more as he gets older!"
3,"Cute story, but too long","My daughter is 13 months and I'm sure when she gets older she'll enjoy this book. I bought it because it was high up in the list of 100 best kids books and it was rated for 0-3. For her age right now, it's still a little to verbose for her. She likes shorter stories."
5,Same lovely story from my childhood,"I just got this book today and read it to my daughter. It's the same sweet story from childhood, and would be a great Christmas story for any child."
4,Beloved book,I loved this book as a kid and my 2 year old loves it now! I was a little disappointed when it came because the bear is smaller than I thought (so is the book) but it is perfect for her. She doesn't mind that it's small and we have to read this every day. She's got it memorized for sure!
3,I guess we're in the minority,"This book bores me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of children's books, but this one just doesn't have the magic of the other classics. My kids rarely request it at story time.However, the story does have heart and there is nothing harmful in it, so I gave it three stars."
1,huge and stupid,"This book is gigantic, so huge you could use it for a liferaft.I read through it at my local bookstore recently (only took me ten minutes!), intrigued by the gigantic size. The story contains some simple art in the style of curious George, but nothing about it justifies the absurdly huge size.If you're gonna buy it, buy it as a gift for a friend. That way, figuring out how and where to store it is their problem."
5,Beware - you'll soon know it by heart,"This is one of those books that adults, in desperation, soon need to hide. At age two, my nephew so fell in love with Corduroy that he constantly requested a re-reading and soon knew the text by heart. The kids will love the tale, which is great fun, though it will leave the reader wishing toddlers could read to themselves."
5,Adorable Book!,This is such a sweet story about a bear and a girl who gives him a home. My preschoolers really loves hearing this book again and again.
5,Excellent,I loved this book growing up so I bought this for my nephew I also got the corduroy teddy bear and he had hours of fun playing with it and listening to the story
5,book and stuffed corduroy set,A great gift if you are planning on buying the Corduroy book anyway. Practical packaging is easy to wrap and looks nice.
5,My favorite book,"Corduroy was one of my favorite books from the time that I was four years old. Recently, I was sorting through the basement, and came across it once again. I felt as though i was four again, reliving the amazement and wonder of Corduroy and his nighttime adventures. I highly reccommend this for any youngster!"
1,Don't buy the Kindle edition!,"I bought the Kindle edition yesterday when it was on sale. I was so excited to share it with my granddaughter at bedtime. Unfortunately, when I opened the book, it was viewable in landscape mode only, and the pictures were too small. I will definitely try to get a hard copy of this so she can see just how special Corduroy is!"
3,Funny--and brave,"Wilder's book is funny, not clever-sarcastic-funny, but the kind of funny that happens when you look closely at life the way it really happens. It's also a brave and generous book--he gives us an intimate look at his life as an truly engaged father, all sides, not just the funny stuff. I can't wait for his next book to come out!"
1,Concerned Parents Beware,"This is not a book to buy if you are searching for good, clean funny reading. I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day. I read some of it - more than enough to get a good idea of its bent - then passed it to my husband with an apology and another gift to outweigh this disastrous purchase. After he checked the book out, we both agreed the proper place for it was the trash can. If you want a decent and truly funny book to read or to give your husband for Father's Day next year, you need to look for another book."
4,Daddy Needs Arink,"This is a really funny book, which I can identify with having reared four children - 3 sons and 1 daughter. My husband did not get too involved with actual hands-on jobs of diaper changing or feeding; but, just imagining him going through the 'changing his daughter's diaper in the mens' room scenario' was hilarious. He can count one one hand the number of diapers he changed (four kids remember!!). I would highly recommend this reading for anyone - Mom or Dad - whether they are going through it currently or in past memories."
1,Reader Beware!,"Perhaps this book is hilarious - I only read the first 3 chapters, which I found to be mildly ammusing. I wish someone had warned me that it is full of vulgar language. I DO use lots of humor in raising my children, and was looking forward to reading this, but I don't need profanity in a book on parenting! I was raised by a brilliant teacher, who always taught me that ""an intelligent person can express what they need to without offending anyone."" My copy went into the recycle bin. I don't need foul launguage filling my thoughts and possibly slipping out of my mouth as I work with my children, whom I love. If you don't enjoy vulgar language, don't read this book!"
