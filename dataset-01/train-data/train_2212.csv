4,"Quick, efficient and easy to clean","My old Mr. Coffee grinder stopped working after 5 good years of service. I used it mainly for spices. This one does the job very well, with the added bonus that it is easy to clean. Hope it lasts longer than the previous one. If you are looking for a spice grinder, I would recommend this one, because it is easy to clean, and the smell of one spice will not affect the others."
1,Don't pay more for nothing; mine stopped working after 2 months,"I bought this coffee grinder based on its rating and reviews, and I paid more for it than I normally would for a coffee grinder; however, not only was this coffee grinder nothing special, it was poorly designed, difficult to use, and then it stopped working after only 2 months of moderate use, and I had to go and buy yet another coffee grinder! Only this time, I learned from my mistake and simply bought the cheapest one I could find. My lesson: A coffee grinder doesn't need to be fancy; all it needs to do is grind beans, so don't be stupid like me and fall for a bunch of whistles and bells that don't really do anything. The second coffee grinder I bought was a Toastmaster 1119, your basic no frills grinder -it was half the price, it's much easier to use, and so far, it's lasted twice as long (I've had it about 6 or 7 months now and it's working fine).I hope this helps someone! :)"
3,Disappointed,"I have had this for several years. Not to long after I purchased it the bowl scraper broke, but I kept on using it. Now a part broke off on the lid under the button labeled press to grind. It pushed down to make the coffee grinder grind the coffee. I know that it is cheap, but not worth the money."
1,"If you're a coffee lover, look for another grinder!","This grinder is not worth the low price I paid for it. Unfortunately it was the only one in stock at the store I was shopping the night I bought it. The grind size selector and cup selector are useless as it grinds all exactly the same. I repeatedly got a grind that ranged from powder to half beans reguardless of the grind size I selected or the amount of beans I put in it. When I first pushed the start button, nothing happened. I only got it to start grinding after removing the grinding chamber and lid and replacing them several times. It's advertised as being ""hands free"" but that is false. You must hold down the start button in order to grind. I'm pretty disappointed as I feel as if it wasted 12 cups of my favorite expensive coffee."
1,This coffee grinder stopped working twice in two months,We bought this grinder after reading the reviews. The second time I used it the grinder did not work until after taking it partially apart. I ground up a couple of pounds to have on hand. When I tried to use it this morning it once again would not work. I will try contacting the manufacturer and see if I can get a replacement but I am not pleased with the performance so far.
2,Bad for grinding finely for espresso machines,"the ""fine"" setting doesn't grind it fine enough to make decent espresso, so you are stuck guessing how much extra time to add (I haven't yet figured it out). Does a good enough job for drip, though. Very messy, the flip top doesn't help at all. Would not recommend this product."
2,Not great.,"This grinder has produced increasingly inconsistent grinds. It's not a burr grinder, and it's not meant to be. But I get whole beans along with fine powder, no matter how long I grind it for. In addition, the cheap design of the scraping blades means that they break and the scraping function becomes useless pretty quickly. Overall, I'm not pleased."
1,Miserable design,"I don't often write a review of anything, but this morning after the usual suite of inconveniences centered on this otherwise eventless activity, I thought I should share my experiences. Short cord. Yes, you can pull it out. Mine only comes out so far. I have tried everything short of breaking the plastic cover. Consequently can only stand by a wall socket. Biggest complaint: it makes a mess. The top flips open. When removed, the top tends to dangle in course of removal, spreading grounds everywhere. The motor is weak, or maybe the combination of cheap cutting edge and weak motor causes uneven grinds. Cannot fill very much in cup to grind, otherwise VERY uneven grind. Was an impulse buy. Too many pieces should make buyers wary. Go for simplicity in design and efficient cutting edges. Make it all happen in one move. Recommend paying more for satisfaction and longevity."
4,Great mid-range coffee grinder,This was my first coffee grinder and I'm happy with it's performance and features. I would have given it 5 stars if the material quality felt a little better. It feels like the chamber might break or wear out but only time will tell that for sure. I really like the settings for the grind and how that is automatic. You can wrap the cord inside the bottom of the device so that you only have the length of cord you need available and you can wrap the cord back up each time if you wanted and it makes storage in the cabinet easy for me. That auto timing and settings make this grinder worth the extra over a regular entry level grinder. Much better price than a mill grinder and in my opinion the assortment of settings makes this unit better.
3,Used in a coffee club - lasted about a year,"This grinder is nothing like the one I have at home, but it was great for the auto-off feature; as long as it didn't reset the # of cups and course settings!!!! It never really ground the coffee fully, even at Fine / 12 (for a 10 cup maker).Lastly, the grounds release twisty feature the basin includes got one break after about 9 months, and now is totally unusable - leaving grounds / dust in the bin. Overall, looking for another brand to replace this one."
1,Broke after only a few uses,"I got this to replace a cheap grinder I've been using for many years which still works but is very small. After 5-6 uses, the Chamber Maid cleaning system detached and was destroyed by the blades. This happened on the same day as a new Mr. Coffee French press broke, also after only 5-6 uses. I got these both in late December and neither lasted through January. I'm done with Mr. Coffee."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was not expecting a whole lot from a grinder that I paid twenty bucks for at wallyworld. It grinds coffee well enough for a drip coffee maker, but the grounds are not terribly consistent.I did get a bit more than a year of near-daily use out of it, but now it's broken. The inner plastic chunk of the grinding chamber broke off, and now it's useless. The motor assembly works fine, and it feels like such a waste to throw away something that is 90% functional. But seeing as that extra 10% of functionality is the entire purpose of this product, it's time to find a new grinder.I would only recommend this if you're strapped for cash and need a grinder quick, or if you don't grind coffee with any regularity."
3,Chambermaid can be helpful if you know how to use it and timer not that good,"Coffee grinders...Just buy your coffee out! LOLThis Mr. Coffee is different with the CHAMBERMAID SYSTEM! I just wanted to sound dramatic with that term. Basically, it's a plastic insert that scoots the coffee into piles, thus making it easy to fall out. You just move grab the top of the insert and move in a circle and you wil see little indivual piles of coffee where the plastic nodules used to be. I like it I think!The timer didn't gind 6 cups on ""fine"" fine. It was more like course. It takes somewhere about 50 seconds to a minute to grind beans fine. It might depend on what type of beans it is too. Anyways, ignore the timer.The blade doesn't look that good. I wish it was better.I perfer a plastic bowl to a stainless steel bowl. Coffee really sticks to stainless steel.The flip top lid kind of sucks. It's flimsy."
1,I hate the short power cord,"I hate this grinder because of the really, really short power cord. I keep spilling grinds because I can't pull it closer to unload the grinds. Constantly spilling everywhere. Hate it!!!"
2,Broke after a few months,"I bought this machine because it was a Mr. Coffee and for the price. My Mr. Coffee machines last until I HAVE to throw them out just because they're so old. No so with this grinder. After a few months of grinding one cup of coffee a day, it broke. While it lasted, it did a pretty good job but the beans were not always ground completely. Plus it was a bear to clean. Now I have to buy another one which means that if I had spent a little more money on it initially, I wouldn't have to go out and buy another one. You get what you pay for."
1,Disappointing coffee grinder,"I bought this inexpensive coffee grinder because it had some nice features: grind settings, removable grinding chamber, clear windows, etc. The electrical cord only runs about 12 inches, not enough length away from the wall socket. Even with the finest grind the grinder shuts off before the beans are sufficiently ground. Worse the beans at the top of the cup aren't ground at all, leaving whole beans in the cup. I was so disappointed and dissatisfied with this grinder that I went out and bought another one just a month or two later. I've read where others were satisfied with this one, but for grinding large quantities of beans or for fine grinding, better try another model. This is the least satisfying grinder I've ever owned."
2,Not worth the time....,"We actually returned this grinder, because it's just a fancy mill grinder...the other Mr. Coffee Burr grinder (not made anymore?) was MUCH better. I found one on ebay and still have it. This is just a mess to use. Don't bother."
2,Adequate,The electric cord is exceptionally short and the grinder must be within a few inches of an outlet.
1,disappointing product,this machine was to replace myold Mellita which had finally stopped.I tried it two times and couldn't believe how shoddy it was.I put it in the Goodwill box and quickly ordered a new Mellita whichI should have done to begin with.
3,Big red dog,This cute book really touched me. Clifford is so adorable in it. I reccomend this book to little kids. My sister used to hate dogs but when she read this she began to love them. Thankyou for writing such a nice book mr clifford writer.
4,not good for expierened gamers,Hi I am an expeirenced gamer. FIFA 2004 is a very good game but it is to easy. I can be the worst team and beat the best team with the skill level on world class. Also in order to do an international tournament you have to connect your GBA to a Game Cube with FIFA 2004 in both of them and the game cube has to have so many points. Overall good game to easy
1,whoever made this game must have da same IQ and Shoe size,"This game is without a shout of a doubt overated. All the keepers seem to be the best players in the game. and who the f**k is Pascal Zuberbuhler da best player on this game at 98 skill we have no proof that this guy is the best player in the world!And what were they thinking in underating Ruud Van Nistelrooy at 84 when he shud be more like 93 skill, and they done the same thing with Roy Keane only at 78 skill. id say this game is pretty screwed up when comes to rating the players. Overal id say whoever made this game needs to have their head cheeking"
2,The title of this book should read creative vases,The entire book is devoted to most unusual vases which would be used by very few people. The actual floral designs used do not require a great deal of creativity.
4,Grap it!,"I was and still is inpire by the Mark of the East. These brothers got spirit, skills and heart.God Bless you.P.S. Mark of the East Chapter II?"
2,We didn't click,I have searched for months for a good commentary on the Gospel of John and it looks like the search continues. I got it based on the reviews I have seen on the book from readers. I guess its different strokes for different folks. I am more of a greek and indepth detials on new testament words. My type of commentary is the classic on Jude&Peter by Bauckham. I didn't get that type of exegesis from Brown.
5,BEST CD I've Bought THis Year!,"This is one of the most outstanding CD's in my collection. Since purchasing it two weeks ago, it has been played at least 30 times. I must agree with the first review that repeated listenings reveal nuances and subtleties that were missed on early listenings."
4,A breath of fresh air...,"This is an excellent contemporary jazz album, moody and atmospheric, yet very unique. The piano playing is lyrical and pleasant, with plenty of tasteful space interspersed to ""let the music breathe."" Much of the album is soft and haunting, like a soundtrack to deep recollections one might have at 3 AM, though certain tracks, such as the stand-out ""Dodge The DoDo,"" kick in with monster drum beats that could fit right in as a loop at a drum'n'bass club. Frank Zappa said, ""Jazz isn't dead, it just smells funny""... this is a new form of jazz that is brilliantly alive and smells very fresh and sweet. I have listened to it over and over and have increasingly enjoyed its depth."
4,Mesmerizing,"I concur with those who have given this CD positive, even glowing, reviews. (I'm not swayed by the comparison to Kenny G that one reviewer makes.) This music evokes the early work of Pat Metheny and Lyle May sand even Ralph Towner's solo Blue Sun, which is obliquely odd considering there is no lead guitar.Rippling keyboards command one's attention, but it's the interplay of all---keyboards, bass, drums, assorted percussion and a few effects---that creates a hypnotic blend, a jazz mind-meld. Nuance and subtlety play a key part too, for the phrasing and spacing add to the aural tapestry.Although the songs cover a variety of tempos and employ distinct ideas, the music, save for a strange, unlisted bonus track, is never strained or discordant, though full of energy and vibrancy."
5,Nice sense of direction...,"I listened to EST's latest album ""A Strange Place For Snow"" before listening to this one - This One's Better!Somewhere Else Before has a strong sense of direction toward eclectism - not weird, ecletic. A very nice combination of fused (not fusion) traditional trio jazz, electronics, 4/4 rock, and strong melodic lines. All the players have chops, but impressively stay within the melodic structure of the tune - a real compliment to them as musicians/composers. To me this album represents the direction EST wants to go. Unfortunately, A Strange Place For Snow is where they currently ended up. And while it is by no means a bad album, it is not the next logical progression from Somewhere Else Before."
5,Another Jazz Classic!,"This is one of those discs that you'll play years after you buy it. It never loses its charm. The way it builds from simple piano themes to complex experimental productions (with various samples, radio noize, etc.) it captivating. I've listened to this for more than 2 years, and still enjoy it as much as the day I got it. It's a classic. And one of the best by E.S.T."
2,Not very comfortable for walking,"I purchased these because they were touted as walking shoes, but were the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. The do seem to be built well but lack the cushioning necessary for extended use."
3,"beautiful, but a little too easy for me","This book is full of beautiful pieces, but unfortunately they are a little easy for me.I play at an medium-hard/intermediate level, and have taken piano lessons for nine years.The music is still beautiful, and fun to play through. It sounds almost exactly like the soundtrack, which is why i still play through it. I love the soundtrack, so this piano book is alot of fun for me."
3,"A certain theme is very pretty, but the rest of it is dull.","I used this as a sightreading book, and I think it served me pretty well.There's a certain theme which is very pretty. We'll call it `A'. Several of the songs are variations on this theme A: ""Never an Absolution,"" ""Rose,"" ""Unwilling to Stay, Unwilling to Leave,"" and ""Hymn to the Sea.""Then there is the famous song ""My Heart Will Go On,"" which is ok. The song ""Rose"" also has this ""My Heart Will Go On"" theme.The rest of the songs weren't fun to play as there's no melody really or no compelling melody: ""Southhampton,"" ""Take her to the Sea, Mr. Murdoch,"" and ""Hard to Starboard."""
3,it was ok--but OLD,"This item is ok if you're a big collector of old Friends collectibles. BUT I bought 2 of these and the small ""collector"" trays on both were old and cracked and the small thing of coffee was old and hard. Guess you have to take into consideration that Friends ended many years ago & these types of collectibles are going to be worn & old. I love the show though so that's why I said the stuff was ok. Live & learn I suppose."
5,Wonderful CD.,"This CD is one of two which Mireille Mathieu recorded in Spanish. As you would expect from a Mathieu CD, the songs are excellent with good to great arrangements. The singing is superb, and the supporting musicians and supporting singers are top professionals. Another winner for Mathieu. A wonderful CD."
1,Horrible game,"Star Ocean 2 was a very bad game in my opinion. It's battles were dull and I felt I jus had to keep pressing the X button to attack. Characters have no development, I have no attachment to them, they're just there to fight, the only people who have a story are the two main characters and maybe a few supporting characters. The story is dull, translation isn't that good, very boring game. You are better getting Tales of Destiny, Lunar, FF8 or Suikoden 2."
2,ocean,"WARNING:This is a game with annoying music. The plot is alright but a little confusing.The graphics are bad also.This game is 2 cd's long and has lots and lots of different endings.In general the game is okay, but there are better games."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!,"This is by far the worst game I have ever played! I rented it, thinking that it was gonna be so great I would have to buy it later. It was just so boring, the dialogue was not translated well, the story is stupid, the characters are morons, the jokes are awful, and it takes an hour just to get into a battle. Don't get this game!!!..."
2,Dont waste your money...,"When I first saw this game, I thought it would be really cool...and it is...for the first like hour or so. The story line is pretty good, but the narrative parts are just way to long. And the battle system is horrible. The graphics are pretty good, but that really doesnt make up for how bad this game really is. If you want a good rpg, get one of the Final Fantasy games, just dont wast your money on this game, I wish I didnt."
4,Star Ocean Series,This RPG offers a lot of options and ways to increase the status of the characters. I am playing it through for the 2nd time with the Male Lead character in order to open up the Universe / Galaxy version of the game. This is a good game to buy if you like to replay a game.Not too violent or gory. I am anziuosly waiting for Star Ocena 3 which is supposed to come out on Playstation 2 next year.
5,A Great RPG,I love this game. It's a classic. I played this game ten years ago. Wish they had a better sequel because Star Ocean Til The End of Time was not that great.
4,I was......taken in,"I must say....this game is alot of fun, there are many many many endings so replay value is great. I thought I would hate it, I don't care much for the ""sprite"" type char but after playing for just a hour , making your own weapons, food, goods........ well it was a blast. I would buy this !...... an well I have :)"
4,Great Sound and Great Graphics,This game has some of the best sound that I've ever heard from a playstation game. For instance near the beginning is a scene where it's thundering and raining and if you have a decent surround sound system the sound of the thunder rolling across the speakers is truly quite amazing. The graphics also I think are even better than Final Fantasy VIII granted they are much more anime like and not so realistic as the FF7 and FF8 graphics but I like them better they are more colorful and seem to have more detail as well. As for the gameplay the game seems to have an okay storyline with a pretty sweet battle engine and nice interface. Overall if you like RPGs this is definitely worth it.
4,my quick review,"Game was in very good condition, it wasent as good as Star ocean 3 in my opinion but it is a great part of my collection."
5,a VERY COOL GAME,even tho i have yet to beat it. i love it!i acualy have but it is so fun. i have everything and the voice thing is so cool!
2,the typical generic rpg,"yeah, nice intro, cool begining, you have 80 different endings and 2 characters to play; but there it stops in hype. The story is so typiical, the script or what they say its aweful and the action battle scenes are clumsy to use, and who would play this game 80 times to see the ending i could barley do one before going crazy with the slow and corny dialogue of the sequences, it just didnt stick to you...save your money, buy lunar trust me.."
3,A great idea that needs a little more work.,"The concept behind Star Ocean 2 is great. The plot is long and involving. Private actions offer a lot of flexibility in the plot as well as determining the type of ending you get. How many other games can say they have 80 endings... NONE! I like the real time battles where your allies act on their own. Unfortunately, sometimes your allies act dumb and you have to tell them everything to do, which gets mind-numbing quickly. If they souped up the graphics just a little bit more and did a little more with the music (which wasn't bad to listen to, but wasn't exciting), the game would rate right up there with the Final Fantasy games. I love the character interactions and the voices."
5,OUTSTANDING,"When I play this game a few choice words come to mind,innovative,beautiful,and wow. I love the item creation though it may be random it still is very cool. The graphics are very lush and well green. The battle system is one of my only complaints, you see the battle system no matter how seasoned you are in the world of RPG's(I personally have been playing RPG's since I was 6 yrs old.) all those skills are now useless. You control one character while the CPU controls the rest of the people on screen kinda like Tales of Destiny. Now as soon as a battle begins you have two options [1.Go into a button pushing frenzy and hope for the best.] or [2. Try to think logically and lose the fight.] You see the game does not reward game skills like FF's or other RPG's instead you have people like my brother who press random bosses and succed where I failed.Other than this one disguting flaw I feel no reason to really play anyhing else."
3,Not as good but still interesting if you like Boston History,This book was basically a rehash of O'Connor's Boston Irish book. The book revolved almost exclusively around the Irish Catholic experience to the almost virtual exclusion of all other Catholic ethnic groups. Still the book is a very interesting portrayal of the evolution of Boston's culture. I would suggest this book to anyone with an interest in Boston history
4,FOR HYDRATION AND PLUMPING,"How wonderful to be able to enjoy the benefits of a dermatologist without an office visit (or the bill!) This is an easy to use two-step treatment that serves to plump wrinkles and fine lines as it thoroughly hydrates.Once a week works well for me, and all I have to do is apply the intense Hydra Mask to my face after cleansing. Follow that with the Self-Heating Mask then relax for about 15 minutes.Each box contains six applications, which shows how very cost effective these treatments are.Thank you, Dr. Gross!- Gail Cooke"
5,very well-told story,"I read this many years ago, so this purchase was for a second reading and to suggest to my bookclub. Since it is a book that I've remembered from so long ago, I thought it would be a good book to discuss in book club. The main character of the story is from ordinary stock, but experience life much differently, extraordinarily. I need to reread to refresh details, but am eager to do so."
3,Ruined a great series!,"I spent almost a year playing MAOH 1, and I never got bored. When I heard about Rising Sun, I couldnt wait, I knew it was going to be as good as the first one. I was wrong, while it is a great game to play and just as much fun as the first one. It is WAY WAY TO SHORT, I was in shock when the credits came rolling only after the 7 or 8th misson. They save system wasnt very cool, but it made it more challenging. I would recommend this game, I am just VERY disappointed of the shortness of it."
4,One of the worst!,"Ok, I thought that since it was Medal of Honor, The game would be much better then what it looks like on the internet. So I purchased it at work [I work for EB Games]. Anyways, The game its self is HORRIBLE!!!! The walking animations makes it look like you're made out of rubber, It takes 3 shots with a stupid sniper rifle to take down the enemy and the levels look cheap! This game is terrible. It's very unrealistic and isnt worth 50 bucks! Come on EA Games, GET IT TOGETHER!"
2,Needs better gameplay,"Being a fan of MOH, i was rather disappointed with this installment. The game just seems like it was rushed to the shelves. The levels aren't as extensive as i'd have liked, such as the missions and the amount of freedom you have to choose your own routes during each mission. The graphics at times are so darkened that you can't even tell where you're going. The AI also seems lessened then Frontline. On a high note, the co-op play in this addition instead of just the usual one-on-one is a great addition. Overall this game is a good rental but not worth the asking price of 49.95."
2,Huge disappointment!,"I loved MOH Frontline and still play it frequently. MOH Rising Sun is a HUGE letdown. It's short, the AI is terrible, the weapons are boring, there are very few extras, the levels are underwhelming, and they messed up the grenade function, which seems like a small thing until you play the game and can't really use grenades strategically as you can in Frontline (see other reviews for more specifics about how the grenade function changed). Also, the graphics are nothing special, with the exception of the opening sequence, which is where the makers of this game seemed to have spent all their efforts. Too bad they didn't put more time and effort into gameplay itself. This game is worth about $15; unfortunately, I paid $50. This game is a bummer. Don't waste your money."
3,A weekend rental... don't buy!,"Although I didn't think this game was totally awful I was definitely disappointed. The ability to have two players is great. But the graphics were average or less and the entire game took a friend and I only about 6 hours to finish! The cut scenes were nice but the gameplay was fairly repetitive and obvious. Even though they say you can ""choose your own path"" what that seems to boil down to is going around the rock on the left or right side. The game is still very linear. So rent it, beat it in a night or two and then you won't feel the need to ever play it again."
3,No Men on team,There are no men on youre team pretty much. I would strngly suggest Frontline which is long and has men on youre team. I do like the bots in multiplayer. I also like co-op mode. Bottom line: TOO SHORT AND NO MEN ON YOURE TEAM.
1,A Terrible Game- worst ever,"This game would take about about an hour to play if the controls and weapons were at all responsive. Some of the environments look pretty, put the enemy fighters are straight out of a windows 95 first person shooter.People complain about suppossed racism in the GTA series, but our group of racially mixed gamers found the asian enemies in Rising Sun to be offensive stereotypes beyond anything in Vice City. Unlike Vice City, which is violent with an obvious tongue in cheek sarcasm, this game wraps it's racial violence with themes of patriotism, making Rising Sun truly disturbing."
3,"FUN, but a little unreallistic.....","Overall, this is a great game. Nice graphics, good immersion, great storyline, (perhaps the best in MOH history). And great multiplayer. But, theres always been something wrong with the moh series, the fact that it can take up to 4 round out of an m1 to kill someone! Weapon AI has a serios problem in this game. This is emphisied greatley on the last level. A tipe 99 light machine dose damage like a 22!, taking up to 6 rounds to kill someone! the last time I checked an 8mm 150grain put someone down CLEAN. And the springfield is a joke, the enemy can take take a round in the torso and come back up shootin in seconds like nothing happened!!"
4,A great but too short of a game,"To start of, I am thirteen years old so you know I am a video game freak. When I played this game, it was an OK game. By OK meaning it was an average satisfying game. The best thing about the video game was the graphics and settings. The worst thing about this game was that it was too short. If you're a person who doesn't play many video games and just likes playing two times a week, get this game, but if you're a person who loves intense video games and you can't stop playing, you might want to rethink about getting this game, (I beat it in 5 hours.) If you played Medal of Honor Frontline (the game right before this one,) you would not want to get Medal of Honor Rising Sun because of its length. Don't get me wrong, it was a great game, but the designers ruined it with the shortness of the game. I hope this review was helpful to you."
1,do not buy,it is a horible game me and my brother got it for christmas and it was horible ours didn't eve have english instructions i highly advise no one to buy this game so microsoft never makes it agein-assasain
4,Frontline was better.,Maybe I am not looking at this game as it should be. Granted I just bought 5 games at the same time.1. Rainbow 6 32. XIII3. Project Gotham 24. True Crimes: Streets of LA5. (this one)I got this thinking it would be better then the one before it. I thought the intro would knock the socks off the other but I still think the D-Day scene was way better. The only thing I can say good about this game so far is the sound. Make sure to turn on your 5.1 Surround sound! The AI still looks 2d.
3,Call it a 3.5,"This is a fun game, but its standards aren't as good as some other shooters. The graphics are so-so and no blood or anything and the whole bodies disappearing right in front of your face is still strange to me. The 2 player was an improvement over the first xbox medal of honor title and as I said the game is fun but not very ""free"". It is so funny not to be able to jump a fence or climb a small rock etc. My recomendation is to buy the Ghost Recon games, Splinter Cell, original Medal of Honor, Halo, and Hitman 2....all under $20 now except Halo or to keep playing them until this game goes down to $20.00. Definitely buy it, but buy it cheaper .....rent it for now."
2,A let down after MOH Frontline,"I'm not a big FPS games fan, but I got hooked on to MOH Frontline which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I bought MOH Rising Sun expecting it to be even better...what a let down it was! The game was way too easy and when it abruptly came to an end, I was very disappointed. The storyline and missions are not bad, but the level of difficulty and the dumb soldiers are ridiculous. The graphics are mediocre. In the single-player missions your comrades sometimes get in between you and the enemy, and your enemy can still shoot at you but you can't! I think two pluses for this game - it now costs only 15 bucks or so, and the game has save points all along the various missions (a big improvement over Frontline)."
2,Stupid Saves,"I have been reading the other ""bad"" reviews and aggree with them. Its a fun game, but it could have been much better on the the XBOX. What about saving the progress... Am I the only person who has to step away from the game to run an errand or whatever, and has to wait until I find a stupid ""save spot""? Is it really that hard to have a save option on the menu, to allow you to save whenever you want? Games have been doing this forever."
2,Not Worth The Money...,After playing the last 2 fantastic Medal of Honor's this was a horrible outdated lack of technology version. Maybe was not bad for the time it was made but if you are used to todays new games then do not go here.
2,TO SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Way to short bad graphics boring a flat out wast. DO NOT BUY RENT.
2,It's over?! What a waste...,"I loved the first MOH game. Needless to say, I was excited when Rising Sun was released. I was completely dumbfounded when I was able to complete it over the Thanksgiving weekend in less than 6 hours! When the credits started rolling after the aircraft carrier scene I truly thought that it was the end of the first half, not the ENTIRE GAME. It is a truly stupendous waste of money.It is too bad that the folks living near me at Electronic Arts couldn't have done a better job of living up to a reputation, rather than cashing in on a name.Don't waste your money."
2,Graphics so bad you'll get motion sickness,"I bought and played this game when it came out in 2003, then sold it, and got it again in a collection recently, so I'm posting my review now after playing it again. Wow, I'd forgotten (but now recall) that the graphics were so bad. Any indoor scene, the graphics are SO BAD that they gave me motion sickness. It seems to be a framerate problem, with a blur when you turn. I have component HD cables and a 1080P 46"" LCD, so it's not my hardware. Other games, like Fable, look amazing. The models and everything in the game are so bad it looks like a Dreamcast port. I think it was a PS2 port...if I'm not mistaken. That explains it. I was a big fan of Frontline, so I'm not bashing the series. All later games really rock on newer systems. This one, for retro purposes, just fills one's collection but is mostly unplayable unless you just want to waste hours of your life."
2,Rising with a little dropoff.,"With the newer FSG available, this game has shown its age. Glad the used price was cheap and I could resell it to someone else. Can't say too much more and the other reviews said it all."
3,WAY TOO SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love MOH. However, this game is NOT worth the $50. The game ends with you blowing up a Japanese aircraft carrier and the co-pilot saying, "" we have unfinished business, let's go find your brother."" Then, the credits. I was dumb-founded. The first MOH seemed 2x as long. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!! RENT IT FIRST. It will be your wisest investment."
2,"Do you like trimming your toenails, grasshopper??","The Medal of Honor games have always been great. Until now. This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline. It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game. The ""Pacific Battlefield"" looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud. Real pretty it is. I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?) The gameplay is a little tedious, as well.Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-.If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200. That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer. Send all payments to:Raoul Drake515 Pensacola Hooker Ave.Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999.Stay sober!"
5,WOW! This is a GREAT game!,"I just got this game a few days ago and i was blownaway! this is an incredibly fun,action packed game.the levels are just like real WW2 combat and thegraphics are great. I highly reccomend this game toanyone who is into WW2 or James Bondish type of games."
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most horrible WW2 game I have played yet. I have played much better games such as Brothers In Arms. Its a total waste of money. The only good thing about is coop and Multiplayer bots. Trust me it SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
4,Its no Call Of Duty,"I got this game as a gift. Its not a bad game at all. All gamers must know every game has its flaws. The pearl harbor level is really cool. It captures heated moments in the attack and makes you think. MOH has always made great games.MOHAA is the best in the series, hands down. If you guys want a good WW2 game, buy Call of Duty for the PC you wont be disappointed"
4,fun game,"This game is the best game ever. I hope EA games makes more medal of Honor's. But that will probably be a while. I suggestes that you buy this game and what ever else u want. You are big kids and some of you are girls. That reminds me for all of you hot momas out there that are reading this to decide if you are going to get this game for your kids, this is a must have game."
2,Okay in a pinch,"While it works okay, this adapter has its share of issues. It is only adequate from a performance standpoint - and not as good as some less expensive models from other providers. When I upgraded my wireless router (to an 'N'-compliant unit) this adapters driver crashed the computer it was on. I had to go to another machine, download an updated driver, and install that before I could continue. Just okay - in a pinch."
2,Lost in translation,"I'm going to give the Lady Sarashina the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is a lot lost in translation, particularly when it comes to Japanese poetry. While the preface was interesting, the actual tale was not. There really was not much even historically interesting about it, as you don't get much detail about anything happening politically nor even how women lived in the time period. Sarashina focuses on landscapes and her feelings about her experiences. Perhaps in the original Japanese, this is more effective as you could admire her wordplay and style. In English, none of that carries through. Although this volume is short, I would give it a pass unless you have to read it for a class."
5,Violin for Relaxation,Excellent selection of violin music and its performance. Relaxing and meditative. Restful and uplifting. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes violin music.
5,Just What I Wanted,"The title is apt. It's not just dreamy, but it is relaxing. And of course for those of us who love violin music, it is truly fine. Many of the pieces are familiar, but many more are not (to this rather newbie classical lover), which helps expand my experience. I've played it quite a few times already, mostly while doing otherwise boring data entry."
3,Look closely,"I'm replacing a 12 year old Saco I charger with the fi-shock 505. I overlooked the fact that this charger DOES NOT have an indicator light, which means checking it everyday with a probe. How much would a light add to the cost of this thing, a nickel?"
3,Not bad,"Camp Blood- The title is actually from ""Friday the 13th series"" thats what they all called ""Camp Crystal Lake' Anyways, this movie isn't so bad, it does look like someone used a camcorder and video taped it, but it's ok. I would say if you are a ""B"" movie fan, this one is worth checking out. If you are looking for serious horror, then look away. The story follows 4 kids who go camping @ ""Camp Blood"" they find out why it's called that, when they meet a crazy man in the middle of the road on the way to the camp site. Apparently there was a massacre, completed there a few years back by a killer clown."
1,????,"How is this series getting a 3 star average. these movies suck, and no they are not funny, they suck to much. i got a hernia just watching the first one let alone being forced to watch the next 2 by a friend. AHHHHHHH."
1,*Not Horror*,These movies just remind me of people being videotaped while in the woods.I do not recommend them at all.I do love horror movies.But these are not what I call horror.
4,Clowns in the B horror genre? Say it isn't so!,"This is one of those superbee campy slasher films. You can see the dollar signs go up though on the budget in subsequent films. The third one has at least one attractive person in it that looks like they may be a real actor. The 3rd would appeal to most audiences, but you have to be a true fan to really enjoy the first two. My suggestion is to get some friends together, fill up the ice cooler with some adult beverages and NEVER shush anyone that comments during these movies, their comments are the best part!"
3,THE CLOWN IS NOT JUST A STORY,"In the first film 2 couples go camping in the woods only to meet a killer clown. In the second film, a survivor from the first movie (sorry about the plot spoiler) teams up with a movie crew to film a movie about the incident, only to meet a killer clown. The third film involves a reality show going out to that same spot, only to meet a killer clown. I think you get the idea.The blood and body parts were very fake looking. The acting and dialouge were bad, but it wasn't ""campy"" by design. What was funny was when someone got socked (film 2), it made a large artificial popping noise, that was just a moment behind the punch. But even as a ""bad"" movie I can't see more than 3 stars.The first movie was perhaps the best, appearing to be shot in super VHS.F-bomb, nudity, and sex."
4,ha,Ha ha. These movies are hilariously bad. Do you like cheesy horror movies? You'll love these if you do.
4,Perilous Road Review,"The Perilous Road by William O. Steele is a deep detailed story set in Tennessee during the Civil War. The story is about a teenage southerner who hates Yankees. One day he finds a Yankee wagon train so he tells the Confederates when and how to attack. Later on, he finds out that his brother who joined the Union army as a wagon driver could be on one of those wagons! Has he caused the death of his own brother?The Perilous Road by William O. Steele is an action-packed suspense book that keeps you turning the pages yearning for more. The details given in this book were so deep it made me feel like I was there running through the woods with Chris and Silas. In one part of the book Chris is hanging over the side of a cliff for his life while Yankee soldiers chat overhead. If you're a reader who likes to read war novels or just likes to catch yourself worrying about the main character, this is the book for you."
2,Why Did I Pick This Book?,"Before I tell you about this book, make sure it's the book for you. Chris Brabson really hates the union troops. The book takes place in the mountains of Tennessee. When the union troops come down yo Tennessee they steel the peoples crops before they can be harvested.Chris is already furious with the Yankees, but when the terrorize his small, little, country-town that's the last straw. Chris goes through some close calls with life and death, but still manages to realize that war can't solve the problems he has, and that it only makes it worse. I wouldn't read another book in this saga if someone offered to pay me."
3,"Not that Bad, but not that good","I think that the book was sorta boring and definetly not great. I mean the theme is pretty good, but I've read books that were a lot better."
2,"Album okay, but not as expected","I was led to believe by a review elsewhere that this album contained a specific performance of a song. Unfortunately this wasn't the case, and I couldn't verify it prior to purchase. I would not have bought this album otherwise."
3,"Looks good, but not comfortable...","I ordered a size 9, and while I was quite pleased with the appearance of the shoes- simple and chic, I could not even walk forward. The shoes were so tight! I returned them. Not sure if these shoes are available in half sizes, but Id say, you may want to be careful with the size you order, in case they fit too close.They'd look GREAT for work though, both with skirts and pants. Casual, but still dressy enough to be chic."
1,Naturalizer Vesta Flat,I ordered a 7 1/2 AA. The shoe was not true to size - much too wide. I have worn Naturalizer shoes for years and was always able to depend on a proper fit. The last couple of years their shoes have varied greatly. I might try one more order before I give up.
2,Wide is too tight!,"I ordered a size 7 Wide. This was way too tight. Not your usual Naturalizer fit. Returned. Such a cute shoe, too bad."
2,Fell apart...,"I bought this as a decently priced alternative to second hand. I knew it wasn't going to be a super thick wood from the description, but was disappointed within days of the quality... It was hardly full of clothing when we tried to move it a few inches to the side and it fell apart. The back came off and it was a huge mess moving everything out to fix it. Will keep this item for awhile longer but intend to replace.BUT it is a pretty color and does look attractive."
2,Dresser difficulty,The dresser has too many pieces and took forever to put together. For a few bucks more buy one already assembled. Not worth the time.
4,I should have bought a Bunn,"I just wanted coffee quick and easy, and yet taste great. I had a Bunn before. The coffee is wonderful and you dont have to wait very long. That was 15yrs ago, I thought maybe this one would be great or better. The Krups machine is super easy to use, the one and only thing that matters to me is strength. I wasted a whole bag of pods thinking I was doing something wrong. I even went and bought some dark roast pods. I finally figured out its the amount of water. Now I have to use 2 pods to make one cup or I use the pod containers for the espresso and lattes. I just set the machine for two 6 oz. cups and it taste great. I like coffee strong, but the specialty setting is on the tad too strong side. The latch was stubborn in the beginning. Not a machine for someone without full use of their hands. Overall I am happy with it"
3,Almost the perfect 1 cup brewer,"Ok rather than tell you whats great about this machine I will tell you what few flaws it has:1. It does not produce as good of Coffee as the Bunn My Cafe, but it does produce a lot better coffee than a Senseo.2. This machine will unfortunately make some 10g and all 14g pods explode. Which is just a low down dirty shame due to the fact that podhead.com produces some of the best pods out there and they all have a tendency to explode in this machine."
1,Krups KP1010 - Bad choice,"I recently purchase this machine and have used it several times over the past few weeks. I have found that it leaks from around where the lid closes and the water does not flow through the coffee evenly. Frequently, the coffee package is pushed down in the holder which causes the water to flow around the coffee. The result is weak coffee. Frequently water/coffee spatters over the counter. I tried several different brands of coffee.. all suposedly compatible with the machine. I did the research and thought I had made a good choice but I was wrong. I'm tempted to just toss it in the garbage and try something else."
1,Did Not Last,"Was fine for a while but after six months has become defective--constantly blinking blue light, spews steam and nearly burnt me. I'm sure it's still under warranty but rather than the hassle of packaging it up and going without a coffee maker for an extended period of time, I'm throwing it away and buying a Keurig."
1,Damaged,This item was sent to us damaged and missing pieces. It looked like it had been used prior to them sending it to us. I dont feel the company made it easy for us to return it and it was a gift which was very embarassing.I will never order this way again!
2,Not really worth the price,"This pod brewer is convenient and efficient, but at what cost? TASTE! The only pods that work with this machine are Home Cafe (Folgers) and the taste ranges from weak and watery (medium roast) to bitter (dark roast). I've tried various combinations of pods and water levels but the taste is just not the equivalent of a fresh brewed cup of coffee. Not all pod brewers are the same...we have a Gevalia pod machine that accepts various brands of pods and can fit two pods at once for a more robust flavor, offering a taste that is closer to fresh brewed. However, I still prefer to make a whole pot because the taste is just much better."
4,No Hassle Coffee Pod Machine,"Purchased this item right before Xmas. It's the 1st coffee machine of any type that I have ever owned. It makes 3 different size cups, easily cleans up and has a higher then normal clearance from base to spout so it will accomadate most smaller style travel mugs and larger coffee cups/mugs. You won't be disappointed with this unit."
5,Single cup server #2,"This is my second single cup server. My first was an ok Black and Decker that died - multiple plastic failure after a year of use. But that year convinced me I REALLY like getting the coffee in the amount offered by a single cup server. This unit is GREAT. I've had it 11 months already - an not a bit of problms with it. The coffee is great - and I can easily adjust the strength. I have tried the Tea pods - they are all right, but abit weak. I dislike the taste of the cappacino pods - but they act like they were advertised. I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants the convenience of low mess of a single cup server."
3,Easy to use,"We've been using this for a week now and it is very quick and easy to use. I like that the large reservoir doesn't have to be filled each time you want a single cup of coffee.I guess the biggest drawback to the machine (and any of this kind) is whether you like the coffee in the pods that fit the machine. My husband rates the coffee as average, but that is purely a matter of personal choice.This was quite expensive compared to other models but so far we are pleased with it."
3,Krups KP1010 Home Cafe Single Serve Coffee Machine,"Too bad they don't make this anymore. It is a great product. The pods are a lot less then the K-Cups. I finally had to move on to the K-Cups because I finally ran out of parts to fix these things. The other issue is that if you use good pods, the top does not close all the way and it leaks. You have to use the cheap one from the local supermarket for it to close right. I think 95% of the supermarkets have now stopped selling these pods. I finally ended up throwing it away."
3,Krups kp1010,Makes very good coffee but be careful not to use over sized pod as the top will be stuck shut.
4,Enjoying this new pod coffee maker...,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it. First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience. I'm still trying different varieties. The French Roast is so far my favorite. By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes. I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers. Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited. But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee. I find it of good value."
5,happy,Was a gift for my uncle - he was very happy to receive it. I'm glad it was available at a great price.
3,HATCHET JOB,"MOLLY HATCHET-GREATEST HITS: With its trademark triple threat axe attack, MOLLY HATCHET always came off as a harder rockin' but ultimately poor man's cousin to fellow Floridians LYNYRD SKYNYRD. GREATEST HITS conveniently ignores the fact that bloozey growler JIMMY FARRAR replaced original good ol' boy belter DANNY JOE BROWN for two albums, substituting mediocre DJB-sung live versions of two FARRAR chestnuts, BEATIN' THE ODDS and BLOODY REUNION. Early radio staples FLIRTIN' WITH DISASTER, GATOR COUNTRY, and DREAMS I'LL NEVER SEE (a cleverly reconstituted ALLMAN BROTHERS oldie) appear here, but FARRAR-era ballad THE RAMBLER and the band's catty cover of MOUNTAIN's peak MISSISSIPPI QUEEN would have been smarter choices than most of the other tracks. Even with three extra ditties (including a feisty remake of IT'S ALL OVER NOW) tacked onto the expanded version, this so-so collection is hardly the bawdy boogie bash it could have been.RATING: THREE BLADES"
4,A good collection,"A good collection of hits. If you don't have all their albums, this is a good one to have (although ""Flirtin' With Disaster"" is still the best one)."
3,"Ahhhhh, high school memories...","Molly Hatchet was a band I liked back in high school. We used to listen to music before football games (ostensibly to put us in the right frame of mind to inflict maximum pain upon th eopponent), and Fall of the Peacemakers =, incredibly, was the song I remember most vividly. That was the primary reason for my getting this disc. Beatin' the Odds, Flirtin' With Disaster (lot's of aostrophes in Molly Hatcher titles), and other tunes bring me back to the early 80's. I enjoy the double lead guitars, the simple lyrics, the hard driving rhythms. But not very often..."
3,Indulge Yourself,"I'm embarrased to admit purchasing this CD now that I'm a more educated man, but for around ten dollars it took me down a great memory lane from my high school years. No One really needs to know, and my car windows didn't break from the high decibles. Go ahead and indulge yourself, its got great guitar riffs and zero calories......."
3,Del Monte School of Recoding,"I will not quibble with the track selection or number of tracks. Song selection was just fine. But the recording? I think the engineer used the Del Monte method (two tin cans with a string). I'll try it in a couple of other devices, but there was very little middle and almost no bass at all. Molly Hatchet used to grab me in the deepest recesses of my red-neck cockles. But this was just noise. 5 Stars for the album, 1 star for the recording."
4,Good Country Rock,"Extra tracks are nice, many tunes on Greatest Hits that is not on the 1st Molly. Really need both to kick it off right!"
4,Molly...,They seem to mesh it all regarding southern rock and roll. A little of this and a little of that. Sound quality is very good.
4,Singalong Alone,"The fifteen songs on this debut album offer everything from bouncy, hook-laden rock (""Heartbreakin' Man"" and ""Evelyn Is Not Real""), to lonely heartbroken strummers (""I Will Be There When You Die"" and ""They Ran""), to nostalgic (but not novelty) updates of old-time rock n' roll (""Nashville to Kentucky"" and ""The Dark"").First of all, the band is about enjoyment - the only thing they're out to prove is that writing a good song to cry over a beer to is better than most things in this world. Second, Jim sings his heart out, in a voice that has always reminded me of a James Taylor/Thom Yorke hybrid (if you can imagine that). Third, I think it would be more proper to call his lyrics ""mantras"" in many cases, as they are often repetitious but never stagnant. Last...well, do you really need another reason?My Morning Jacket are a great band, and there is no better place to start than here."
5,FRESH AND RAW,My Morning Jackets first album is unlike any that follow it. Its totally stripped down and many are songs Jim James playing solo. James' voice is most distinguished and highlighted on the Tennessee Fire and switches between heavy rock songs and beautiful acoustic music. MMJ has been steadily gaining popularity with every album and are headlining Wakarusa June 2-5 for the first time.
3,Spirited if unexceptional majority of songs,"Heck of a debut from these sincere alt-country emos. Before they began tweaking their now successful multi-pop prowess, MMJ came out of nowhere with this raw, at times hard hitting introduction into rough acoustics, jangly reverb, and of course excellent vocals. Although the mixing leaves much to be desired, a humble and sincere power behind even the simplest of ballads makes some of the lackluster material shine brighter, although few if any songs predict their up and coming songwriting evolution ala ""The Bear"" as a strong opening gives way to lees distinctive fare."
4,Debut? Sounds like these boys rediscovered their roots...,"hardly a debut album from these Kentucky boys, considering they've sporatically toured the midwest for nearly a decade. this is more, in fact, a return to the bluegrass roots these boys were weened upon. less a burning of bridges, as a shedding of hard rock veneer (must we forget their now out of print 1991 album ""Alabama comin' clean"" - brilliant though a bit hard edged for my likes). though the production of ""the Tennessee Fire"" does waver from studio to garage aesthetic, the haunted memories that linger in your mind are all the proof you need to realize this is Americana at it's finest."
3,Eeek and ahhhhh....,"Ok, I'll start out this review by saying that the music on this album is fantastic. The singer's voice is truly impressive and I loved the guitar lines going along with it.The production values however, are another story.I can't think of the last time I have heard recording quality this [poor]. Take for example my favorite song, ""I will be there when you die."" You can hear some sound feedback in the recorder as well as someone actually DROP something in the 'studio' (possibly a guitar stand?). They might have wanted to consider doing a second take on this track?Now before I come off as too harsh, I will say that it is sort of refreshing to see a band do a recording where it is done in one take, as opposed to the ""studio magic"" recordings of most today's pop/rock stars.I just hope they can find it in their interest to re-release this album with upgraded sound quality."
3,Half Finished?,"My mourning Jacket are half alt-country and half indie, but when you're an indie band you end up sounding indie. I'm a bit baffled by the indie movement, why make albums that sound like they aren't finished? This one sounds like a live album, the problem is that most live albums aren't worth owning."
5,Human Sexuality Solid Book,"This book is quite good, covers a lot of pertinent material relevant to Human Sexuality.The information is presented in a student-friendly manner and is a very interesting read, especially for those interested in the topic of Human Sexuality."
5,The Problem With Sequels...,"...is that what a reader wants and what the author wants are often at odds. What a reader usually wants is more of the same -- more of the characters introduced in the first book, more of the world, generally MORE.What an author often wants to do is something completely different. S/he wants to explore completely different characters, a different timeline -- anything to distinguish the first book from its follow-up.I ended up reading this series out of order. I read CAGEBIRD first, then WARCHILD, and now this one. I could see how BURNDIVE might disappoint if followed on the heels of WARCHILD, but I loved it. I thought Lowachee took a huge risk giving us the point of view of spoiled Ryan Azarcon and forcing us, page by page, to care for him. In a way, we were like the Captain... who comes to truly care for his son by degrees.It's a good book, and a true testimony to Lowachee's writing that I could read them all out of order and not feel like I missed anything."
3,Good,"If you read Karin Lowachee's first book Warchild you will probably like Burndive, although this book was not as good as Warchild. I loved Warchild. Burndive is well written, the characters well developed, the story moves along well, but I loved the main characters in Warchild and wished that they played more of a role in Burndive. Overall I would give it a thumbs up."
2,Disappointing follow-up to Warchild,"This was a very disappointing follow-up to Warchild. The former book had an interesting setting, deep characters, and a fairly unique plot. This sequel has none of those things. The protagonist has got to be one of the least interesting characters in any book I've ever read. You know its bad when you're looking forward to the scenes with his bodyguard because that character has some personality! The entire book is much ado about nothing; little happens, the descriptions are vanilla and repetitive. The only thing it has to recommend it is how it offers a different perspective on events in the far-superior first book, and that's not enough to carry it."
5,Another compelling read from Lowachee,"Warchild was such a gripping book that I feared Lowachee would drop the ball on any sequel. But this one is as compelling, if not quite as haunting."
2,Price rip off!,"Charging $47.00 for this import cd is a rip-off. I ordered this from Amazon.UK, the cost of the cd & shipping is less than half of what Amazon is charging here. Why can't we buy this cd for the same price everywhere?The other thing is that Amazon states there are ""extra"" tracks. The cd sold in England has the same tracks as the one sold here."
3,Great read,I enjoyed the historical context mixed with the southern romance. All in all a great read. Would recommend this read fir any one who loves historical romances
2,Forgettable,"I read this about a month ago and had to scramble my brain to remember what it was about. When you forget the plot of a book a few weeks after you've read it you know it was not worth your time. The book details way too much history of the civil war in Florida--this got tedious and boring.The romance just didn't work. It was unrealistic that Jarrett McKenzie the hero hunk had to win a wife in a poker game. The dialgoue, writing and plot were predictable. This is your typical, lousy, run of the mill romance novel. Better than the worst i've read but i would not recommend this book. Definitely not worth the overall 4 star rating."
2,"Dry history, plain lusts and no real love -Disappointing-","I am very disappointed with this book. Normally I love Heather Graham's writing but without those surprises and thrills of a mystery, reading her writing becomes painful.The history parts of the story are so dry I barely skim over them.This romance novel has no real love and emotions. Despite its so many sex scenes, all of them are about Tara and Jarrett's lusts and not their feelings. Throughout the whole book, it seems like they never really care for each other, so I don't feel anything romantic about the story at all. I am glad I have finished the book and can move back to Graham's suspense novels."
4,A runaway who can run no longer,"Tara Brent is on her way from city to city running from a man accusing her of somethimg she didn't do. When she meets up with a card shark and he and he takes her as his payment. In his Florida eden she escapes only to find herself in the hands of a half-breed Indian, Jarrett's brother. She is now controlled by someone who has higher authority on her in the villiage. JARRETT! It was a goood book but in my opinion, not the best of the McKenzie saga."
2,Simple - straightforward - obvious,"This book sets out in the familiar US tone of self-help books on what to do and avoid saying to children involved in a divorce. It is a clear, straightforward instruction on how to behave as an adult in a stressful situation.Being newly separated with a young child, I was hoping for some insight and guidance on childhood responses to stress and sadness.This book provides an overview of that behaviour, and addresses the superficial responses an adult can make.It's a simple book with straightforward assistance. If that's your bag then this book is ok.If you are looking for more than a review of adult commonsense- although that is lacking sometimes- this is not the scholarly work you're seeking.But to make sure, in times of mental stress, that you're still behaving as you ought, then this is a decent guide."
2,Not what we expected,"We were looking for a book about children who were adults when their parents got divorced. Instead this book is about adults who were children when their parents got divorced. So it might be a great book for the right audience, but it did not apply to the situation we were looking for."
3,not a practical guide,"This is not an easy reference guide, but a textbook that gives lots of information that is not needed for daily design use. It is also filled with lots of pictures which would be nice if they were really helpful, but they seem to take up a lot of space and act as fluff."
4,Good overview for textiles,"If one is studying interior design or one wants to learn about textiles, this book is very informative. This was used as a textbook for a textiles class in an interior design program.I recommend this book."
4,Very helpful book on fabrics,I ordered this book for a class and though I have not read through it enirely I plan to keep it for many years into the future. It is an extremely useful book for either fashion or interior design students needing to learn all there is to know about all kinds of fabrics. It might even be useful to avid sewers who desire to learn more about the differences between fabrics and their uses.
4,Very good general overview,This was a great book for an overview but did not go into great depth for some of the topics. The book does have a lot of great picture and I think it is well worth the read.
4,school book..,"This was one of my book assignments for a class of mine. It really helped me get a feel of fabrics when I was unable to go to a fabric store. IT has a very nice glossary in the back to get me more acquainted with the different names of fabrics and everything. Over all, a very informational book."
1,They've got a lot to learn,"I saw this band at Ozzfest, while they were real heavy, there songs were boring and lacked structure. Maybe in 5 years they'll improve. Oh, if you go to Ozzfest this year definetely check out Pushmonkey, they rule."
2,"bent outer blades, twice","This product has been quite a disappointment. On the first try, I used it once and then noticed the outer blade did not sit flush against the base of the arbor, and when I tried to remove it from the arbor it required considerable force. It did cut a nice dado, but I was concerned about safety and possible damage to my saw. So I sent it back to Grizzly, which has great customer service. They paid my shipping and promptly replaced the dado set.Sadly, the second set has the same problem only worse -- the blade simply is not flat. I am not sure whether I will just return this set and buy a more expensive but better made set or perhaps just cut dadoes with a router from now on. It's a shame since so many others seem to have found this a good product. I wonder why I've gone 0 for 2."
5,Only need one as armature hobbist,I bought for my home table saw after using the sets at the shop I use for my projects. The sets at the shop were sometimes in need of sharpening so I bought my own. Very reasonable price. Cuts were true and clean including the bottom. Sizes flexible as expected. Nice case to carry and store. No complaints. Don't think I'll need another.
5,Enjoyable to work with,"I've owned this 8"" stacked dado set for a couple of months and I enjoy working with it every time. It comes in a nice plastic case with several shims for adjustment. The set cuts clean, flat bottomed dados and rabbets and has a precise fit over my arbor (Bosch 4000 table saw). It's easy to install and easy to use."
2,GET OUT THE BLACK FLAG OR RAID..AND POPCORN,"INSECTICIDAL is one of those cheesy bad movies that is ALMOST bad enough to be campy, but it's really a pretty bad movie.The story revolves around a nerdish female student, Cami, whose experiments with bugs to support her thesis goes awry. She asserts that prehistoric insects were bigger and smarter than men; when her snooty sorority mate, Josie, kills all of Cami's specimens, she unknowingly causes them to grow bigger and meaner.The movie's budget shows, and the CGI effects are pretty lame, but there are moments when the cheesiness shines through and INSECTICIDAL almost becomes enjoyable. For fans of giant bug movies, though, you get big spiders, beetles, slugs, scorpions and a big praying mantis with the bluest eyes since Paul Newman.Worth a rental on a snowy night."
3,"All Bug Eyed Monster fans,please stand up.","This is one of those delightfull throw back monster movies. In the 50s,no matter how dopey the situation or how unbelievable the special effects,the cast was professional and played it straight. They sold the movie. Now,as often seems to happen,these independant companies have the skill to create good monsters.But they lack the forsight or tallent pool to get a decent script,or professional cast.So you get a plot as thin as paper full of disposable charecters being eaten by great looking monsters. I am easily entertained,and a serious student of special effects.So the giant insects are the selling point for me.But this flic is not a classic. I like it. But I have no illusions as to why.It is just a fun monster movie. Thats all.Might as well face it,I'm addicted monsters, John F."
2,quickly fell apart,"The 4th time I used this disk, the two plastic parts of the disk separated. The metal disk remained attached to one of those pieces. Glue might fix the problem. I used this disk only for grating Parmesan cheese. I now use a hand-held microplane or a hand-held Zyliss rotary grater for grating hard cheese - both are cheaper and way more durable than this disk."
4,Parmesan/Ice Grating Disc,"I used to grate the cheese myself, but had a couple mishaps with my hand grater. Didn't seem to matter how careful I was, I would still end up cutting my fingers, and boy does it hurt. Now I just put this disc in my KitchenAid food processor, and I can shred the whole block at once and put it in storage jars. Nice and fast, and now I only have to worry when I'm washing the disc, but (knock on wood), I haven't had any mishaps so far. I haven't tried it with ice yet, but I saw a video where someone used theirs to make their own iced coffee. Will be trying that next summer."
4,The Best Christian Band since P.O.D.,"Hey for all you people who haven't heard this CD, you need to. This album could be the best Contemporaray Christian. I myself am a Christian, but don't care to much for Christaina Music, I lke this album some Audio A and All P.O.D. But anyway these lyrics are very heart felt, and there singer has a good voice but maybe tooo reminincent of Bush and Guns n' Roses but they are still good. Besisdes this They are awesome....P>1. Use Me- maybe the heaveist song on this album and an awesome solo! 10/102. Out of my Head- This song is sounds like Nirvana to much! 5/103.Alive- The best song on hear! 10/104.odigal Dad- Good song but the lyrics are pretty sad. 7/105.Kaleidoscope eyes- Third best song on this album! 10/106.Proverb Doll- Good song but easily skipped. 6/107.Electric- Good strong heavy song! Sounds like a more optimistic Alice in Chains Song! 9/10"
2,What's all the hooplah?,"I've heard GS Megaphone and I've been to a concert, so my judgement should be pretty balanced by now. These guys are terrible. The singer's voice gets old fast and they try to make it seem as if they are hard rockers. It's not that way at all. To put it all in one word, hype that can't deliver, and music that isn't that good."
1,DVD Quality A Let Down,I was so looking forward to receiving this DVD - it's a TV movie i can remember from the early days of Alec Baldwin's acting career and was a good thriller . The quality of the DVD was absolutely apalling - it looked and sounded like it was taken from a very poor quality VHS video .It's time that manufacturers of DVD's were made to state on the cover that the quality is poor and has not been digitised .
3,STANDARD TV MOVIE FARE,"SWEET REVENGE is a talky yet involving made for tv movie from the mid-80s. Kevin Dobson (Knots Landing) is cast against type as an opportunistic womanizing major who gets a young Helen Hunt pregnant and arranges for an abortion. When Hunt dies as a result, he shifts the blame to an earnest young soldier (Merritt Butrick) who comes to a tragic end. 14 years later we meet Butrick's sister (a young and engaging Kelly McGillis) who falls for Alec Baldwin, who just happens to be in Dobson's command. McGillis plans revenge on Dobson but when plans go awry, she must confront him from a different angle. Hindered by an amateurish transfer, the movie suffers from its datedness, but with its tight plot and some convincing acting, it manages to be mildly provocative entertainment."
2,A bad copy spoils plot,"I first saw this movie on the shelf and looking at the cast, felt that it would be an engaging event. Sorry to say, the copy looked like it was copied on a $ cheap machine, so the sound is barely audible at times and it winds up and down like a Godzilla horror festival. Sad to say that I will take this movie back to the store for a refund and write the distributor to let them know.. Good idea, bad copy...."
1,Extremely Disappointed,I was so-o-o-o-o disappointed and upset when I received this DVD. It was taped from the television and it was done poorly. Do not buy this dvd. It is a waste of money. The one star is for actually RECEIVING the dvd -- nothing else. A shameful misrepresentation.
2,Walk on By.,"I obtained this movie by accident as I was looking for a UK movie of the same name published some three years earlier.Having got the movie I settled down to watch it but was immediately put off by the poor quality picture and sound.The plot was quite interesting and could provide the basis for a compelling drama along with an examination of the code of honour of officers in the armed forces and the dark reality of the underlying forces of repression in a largely puritanical society.Sadly, this movie was not to provide that drama and although it does have it's moments it is largely a dissapointment but which could do with a large budget remake with an independent producer.Could do better."
3,Written From a Very Academic Point of View,"For the non academic reader like myself I found the style in which this book was written rather frustrating. It uses very upper crust type language and the flow and information gets lost as you plow through the verbage. At the end of it I am left with the distinct impression that we still don't know that much about this subject. Had the author addressed himself to a more general market it might have been more enjoyable. But then, perhaps, it wasn't meant to. Being written in 1927 this may well have been the style of delivery of an academic. Anything I learn on this subject to add to my general interest on ancient Britain is however, appreciated."
3,The book gave me a good introduction OOPs and Pascal,"The book was good for the first few chapters such as building records but going along to the final chapters, lots of codes do not work. Like in the printing portion, searches on the database, code does not work. The author should also emphasize how to build stand-alone applications and make them work on other machines that do not have Delphi on them. But it seems the book does not stress Borland Database Engine scenarios such as how to deal with this utility for installing built applications using Delphi on other machines"
1,"Not only useless, but actually harmful.","It amazes me that Borland would include this book with their Delphi package. Even the easiest examples are error-ridden. If a person can make the examples work, he or she is advanced enough in Delphi not to need this book. The rest of us will consign it to already over-loaded landfills."
1,Typos..typos..typos!,This book would have been pretty good if someone would have done a better job at proof-reading! If you follow the examples as laid out in the book your programs will not work. This book is littered with typos and incorrect screen shots. Someone needs to be fired!
1,I want my money back!,"Worst programming book I have ever seen. One cannot learn how to program Delphi by reading this book because it almost doesn't teach you any. I have been programming for the past eight years. But after reading this book two weeks, I was still clueless on how to program in Delphi. I don't even want to mention all the errors in the book. All in all, you cannot teach yourself Delphi 3 in 14 days. Not by reading this book!"
4,"Nice, with great examples","This book is great for lerning Delphi, if you have some programming skills. It's got great examples, but it won't do for reference."
2,No important points were really hit,"I think the main point while learning to program is to get a full concept of the techniques and skills of application programming. The book does cover this okay. But most features weren't clearly specified, especially whenever a new command or function was introduced. Besides that, too much of the book was used to cover the basic language, not to mention an entire day talking about software engineering, which isn't directly in touch with the learning of Delphi 3. Although it was informative in some ways, but it could have been just a part of the appendix or someting else. The only part that I really thought helped me was the chapter on databases. Other parts were just scratching the spot.I think this book has a lot to improve!"
4,Teach Yourself Delphi 3 in 14 Days (First Edition),"Very EASY to follow. Found a mistake on page 257. Strings must be entered completely on one line. The, "" Button1.Click Memo1.Lines.Add('ListBox String #' "" should be entered on one line."
2,Too many errors spell trouble for the beginner,"A book of this nature has to teach via a useful, comprehensive set of examples. This is not the case with this book. Quite simply, the example applications do not work when programmed acording to the instructions in the book. In many cases, steps needed to get things to work properly are completely ignored. Controls that show up in the code examples have never been placed on the forms, etc.I've been programming close to 30 years, so I was able to eventually sort things out, but I feel if I had trouble getting stuff from this book, a beginner would be lost. I suspect anyone who finds this boook valuable has had some previous Delphi experience, or has programmed similar tools."
4,Nice for setting up databases.,This book is what you need if you want to create a simple application with some database elements. Great examples and explanation.
2,Inappropriate for DIY homeowners,"It's a great cutout tool. I can't argue with the professionals, who love the quality.But for a homeowner, the quality is severely limited by the lack of attachments. As a homeowner, how many cut outs are you ever going to do? Other brands don't have the same quality, but they have a lot more attachments, making them not quite as good for basic cutouts, but much better suited for a lot more jobs.Dewalt doesn't even have a circle cutter or side handle attachment for the DC550. No circle cutter? Are they kidding?While it is fun to have professional class tools, this is clearly one case where a DIY homeowner is better served by spending their money on a more flexible consumer class kit."
2,Not a helpful tool,"My needs are not such that this tool was not necessary, but I needed some new batteries, and for a few dollars more, I received a tool. I suppose others will find uses for it. It is a good tool as most Dewalt tools, but it is quite bulky, and although not the tool's fault, this is a messy tool."
5,Pump it up with the Pocket Pump,"I got my first Pocket Pump free with a subscription to Volleyball Magazine. That was back in 1997 and it lasted me until 2008, so enough said about the quality.It isn't great for pumping up a lot of balls (altough by necessity I have done this), it it is excellent for topping balls off.The neck is flexible so I don't have to worry about the needle bending when I am pumping up balls or when I throw it in my sports bag with all the other equipment.The release valve is very simple to use. You just twist to release air or twist back to add air to balls."
3,It's All Quite Familiar.......,"Take a dash of SARK, mix in some Simple Abundance and Short Guide To A Happy Life,add a splash of other self-help works filled with platitudes and you have ""Life Is An Attitude."" It is a positive book, don't get me wrong, but as I read through it, I thought time and time again, that I had read similar words before. It would make a great gift to a friend needing a boost, or for yourself(as long as you haven't read too much self-help literature), but it's a bit too ""re-cycled"" in my opinion......"
4,High 5,Discovered this band a few years ago whilst in the Cayman Islands and was really taken with them. A great collection of songs which have a unique blend of rock and soul. You will want to play this album again and again .Add this to your collection.
1,A man who used this material would NEVER get my interest..,"I read this book as a joke,,,yes to see how bad the information floating around about women could get and couldn't believe what I read.I doubt 90 % of women would fall into their catagory of nesting instinctual gold digging passive clinging vine verbal fools that this book makes women out to be..I was actually insulted to think that any professional would believe their own recipe for disaster which they wrote. Men,save your money and just be yourself and if a woman doesn't like you there probably is something wrong with her,,she's probably a shallow gold digger or a clinging vine."
2,A great disappointment,"You would think advice coming from a woman would be of great value to a single guy. THIS ONE ISN'T! It has some good advice, but nearly all of it is something that would come from a materialistic woman. She says things like: If you are short, go to a Spanish bar, because the women are generally shorter, women do care about the kind of job you have and what you drive... Talk about damaging advice! This is just her thinking, not all women's. I'll pass."
3,Recommended with reservations,"Portions of this book are just laughable, especially the statement that women ""don't notice"" if men have lost all their hair. Any woman who can't see that is brain damaged or comatose or worse. The truth is, women are extremely conscious of hair, and will not date any man who does not have it. Chrome domes of the world may take comfort from this author's silly bloopers but they shouldn't. Jama Clark's position is that women are in business, plain and simple, and that they will be ""attracted"" to the man who offers them the most profit potential. There certainly are women like that out there, and if you are looking for a bought-and-paid-for concubine, this book is for you. If you have some other idea of a relationship, it may be of less value. Still, it is the best of a bad genre. If you have hair and can't get a date, give this one a try."
1,"Oh, please like none of us knew of this information?","What a circus and what a show, another book on dating for the undateable if they need to read a book about it. The book is a composite of her views, likes and dislikes and guess what, simple manners, self styling and poof you are ready to date! Anyone buying this bull is in deep trouble and anyone selling it is a Witch Doctor of the Third Kind! There are already several books on the subject available and you need not buy this one. Try being polite, attentive and persistence and guess what....you will date sooner or later. The book won't help anyone except those who think they need it and if they need it why read a book whereby you already lack the confidence to be on your own? No one needs to be told how to date, just date, it is like life, there is just life so live it"
5,Good book to understand what women want,"It is an interesting book to read. It is not only informative and contains a lot of practical tactics in stealing a woman's heart, it is also very entertaining to read. From a woman point of view, many of the tactics appears constructive.I have read other comments about this book, it is unfair to discredit this book if the author is divorced. A successful marriage cannot be brought about only by one party, right? Both parties count. This is the book that I recommand in any event."
4,A book for men who want to win.,"This book is the sole resource for understanding why women do the things they do and make the choices they make. Did you ever wonder why a woman will go home with a grungy biker type when you're standing right in front of her in a $400.00 suit? The answer is in here.Dr. Clark has studied this subject in great detail. As an attendee of her seminars and a reader of this book, I find that her theories are accuate most of the time. This book explains how to appeal to a woman's ""subconscious hard-wired biological needs"" in order to establish a rapport with her. It works!Generally, women who read this book are compelled to deny it's validity because they see it as a tool of exploitation. I suppose that's one way to look at it. The men I know who read it just want to find a mate worth keeping and live happily ever after; which is a much better tenet to operate under than that described in books like ""The Rules"" (AKA ""How to Find a Hen-pecked Yes-man for a Mate"")"
2,Not as good as I hoped,"These little seed things dried out too quickly, and did not give the yield I got from more traditional seed starters. The ease of use was not worth it."
3,Good product,"The factory puts a tie to hold the compartments in so when you cut the tie there is a permanent bow to the frame, works good, Should be packaged with a wrap."
1,Sections pull apart.,"I don't fish, but love using Plano boxes for organizing. Unfortunately, the dividers in these boxes do not stay connected. They pull apart making the box contents get all mixed together. I have many other Plane boxes, and none of them do this. Too bad."
1,should have listened to the other reviewers,the item arrived with the back right corner broken on EVERY one of the plastic cases. It's hard to see how it happened in shipment considering they were in the rack. I did get a return label quickly to send it back but I ordered this online so I wouldn't have to run out and get it. Packaging it and taking it to the post office is more effort than going to buy it locally. Don't buy it.
4,"Great Cover, Great Price - UPDATED","UPDATE: I down graded to four stars. I've been using this cover for several months and I still like the product; however, this cover is NOT waterproof and after a night of heavy thunderstorms the cover collected the rain water and funneled it in. Granted there was a lot of rain coming down but I expected the cover to offer more protection that it did. I'll try a waterproof spray on the cover.The cover was purchased for a Vespa GTS300 Super. Though it's a little large, I'm sure it will be perfect if I add a top case and windscreen to my Vespa. The elastic is sturdy and keeps the cover secure. There are grommets to further secure the cover if one is so inclined. The front of the cover has a fleece-type liner that prevent scratching the windscreen and heat-proof liner to prevent melting from the exhaust. The cover beaded the rain effectively and kept my scoot dry in the rain."
2,Does not fit Kymco People 50,This is just plain tiny. Had to tuck in the mirrors and it still doesn't halfway cover the wheels. It was very difficult to even get it to cover that much.
1,"should be marked ""small""","Very disapointed. This cover will not fit a Harley Davidson. It may fit a small sport bike but should not say ""cruiser model"". I am very disapointed. This cover only fits Half of my Dyna ""Low rider"". the x-large fits my ""Street glide"" just fine so i was very surprised. would not recomed this size for anyone who has anything but a scooter!"
3,its good,"i'm usually very happy with dowco products. this scooter cover is okay, but not as thick as i thought it would be and kind of a one size doesn't fit all. Its too big."
3,Hard to put over the scooter,"I really have to wrestle with this cover every time I place it on my scooter because of the tight elastic band. The cover itself is great, as it's thick and durable, but that elastic band is a pain in the ass. Also, it's too small to fit my Taotao 150cc scooter with a giant Bestem T-box trunk on the back. I went with another product instead: Pilot Automotive CC-6324 Silver X-Large Motorcycle Cover, which fits a 150cc scooter perfectly and no hassle getting the cover on!!"
4,Works Great; Very Water Resistant,"I use this cover with a Piaggio MP3 400 with top case and aftermarket Fabbri medium windscreen. The cover fits well and protects well. Rain stays out—even when the temperature drops or when it pools up on cover. I have yet to see how well it deals with the scorching heat and humidity of summer in the southeastern US, but it's going strong so far!"
4,XL fits my Yamaha Majesty. Works pretty well. Not waterproof.,"The XL size fits my Yamaha Majesty with room to spare. It's big enough that it'd probably still fit if I added a large topcase. It's plenty roomy.As others have noted, it's not waterproof, which doesn't bother me since I just want to keep the worst of the rain off the bike when I park it at work in the wintertime.And as others have noted, it'd kind of awkward to deal with when you pull it off the bike. It doesn't have any kind of built-in pocket or anything, so I have to fold it and squash it down to manageable size to put in my backpack. Not a showstopper for me, just a mild inconvenience.You do have to be careful not to put the cover on a hot muffler, even with the heat-shielded panel. After it cools for ten minutes or so, no problem.Overall I'm pretty satisfied."
4,More of a sun protector,"My scooter is still wet after it rains, but it keeps quite a bit of it out.PROS -Fits my 2012 Piaggio Fly 150 tightly (medium size)Keeps it out of the sun (the real culprit) and snowDoesn't balloon out in the windThe lock grommets are a great featureCONS -It's not waterproof (we must get different rain than other reviewers, IDK)Its doesn't store easily when not in use (I don't have a garage), it would be cool if it ""pocketed"" itselfOVERALL -I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their scooter for periods of inactivity (taking it on and off daily in the winter seems pointless as it still gets wet) and/or is looking for some sun protection to resist fading in the warmer weather."
1,Design flaw,"Purchased prior to a hiking vacation. Should have trail tested before leaving. Product has serious design flaw - soft material flap over main compartment zipper that is undoubtedly for rain protection is constantly getting caught in zipper unless one carefully holds it open with one hand while zipping with the other - not very convenient when digging for a ringing cell phone, etc! Also, water bottles leak. Too late to return product Amazon says. Not a happy camper."
5,Classic War Novel,"This book is about the soldiers who fought the initial Iraqi insurgency and their families back home. It is a book that seizes your psyche and compels you to read it through to the end. The author weaves a fabric of todays military including the soldiers, the leaders, and the families of the soldiers. She leaves nothing out of her story that can only be considered a modern classic war novel. She captures fear in its rawest form as experienced by the soldiers caught in an ambush and in the wives who shoulder the burden of being a singular parent of the family. As a veteran Viet Nam, I felt every page of this book as if I had lived it personally. It brought back an avalanche of memories and I am glad I read it. I can highly recommend her book to everyone."
5,Simply excellent,"This is a wonderfully written and compelling book about a fierce battle in Sadr City, Iraq. One of the best war-time books I've ever read."
5,Long Road Home,Excellent Book regarding the personal side of war. A must read for anyone contemplating an decision regard the war in IRAQ.
5,Interesting,This kind of book makes me appreciate what our sevice personal are doing for their country and how greatful we should be to them.
5,The Long Road Home: A Story of War and Family,"A very good read! I was a bit hesitant to buy and read this book,since it was written by a person , Martha Raddatz, who works for a liberal and biased ABC news network. I thought it might just be another ""Bush Bash"" !! It was anything but that. It is well written and very well describes the modern day battlefield that our troops face every day. I would highly recommend reading this book. Thanks Martha !!!! WELL DONE AL"
5,Family Readiness,Absolutely fabulous...being the mother of a soldier I was terrifed and yet strangely comforted by Ms. Raddatz's book. I run an FRG for my daughters group and never realized how important it is...Thank you Ms. Raddatz
5,Bought copies for friends.,"This gives you a clearer understanding of what goes on behind the lines of War. I read this while my husband was in Iraq for 10 months, and as odd as it sounds, it never left my nightstand. It was as if it were my connection to him. Martha did a fantastic job bringing the battles into our homes. I would recommend this any day."
1,Good at First,"I bought this buzzer for my husband just about a year ago and a few months ago it comepletely died! He never grows his hair longer than a half inch, which means buzzing it about every 4 weeks. Given the math, that would mean this buzzer died after 13 uses!I'm so disappointed in the quality and that we tried to ""buy the best"" and got barely any use before the motor died!!They market these as what soldiers use?!?! Do they get a new one ever week?I might write to the company, I'm very disapointed"
3,I guess it's OK.,I received the item in a box that was slightly faded.I wonder how long it had been sitting on the shelf before I bought it. It looked new but runs a bit clunky.I guess it's OK. I will see how it works after a few hair cuts.it also didn't have receipt or paperwork you normally receive along with a purchase.
4,Pleased with product,"Lockset installed without major problems, no modifications needed.Will purchase this unit for other storm doors in the future when the need arises."
5,Lockset,"High quality door lock set! Fit perfectly on my screen door, with about 15 minutes installation. My original set was corroded from the outside weather, so this was wonderful to find an exact replacement handle & lock! They look great, and I'm very satisfied!!"
5,FIT THE BILL,"I HAD TO CALL THE FACTORY TO DETREMINE THEIR RETURN POLICY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT THINGS WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.THE INSTRUCTION SHEET WAS A TAD DIFFICULT TO READ, BUT NOT BAD ENOUGH TO DETER ONE FROM NOT BUYING THE PRODUCT. I DO WISH THEY WOULD HAVE PUT SOME DIMENSION ON THEIR WEB SITE, BUT AGAIN, THEIR RETURN POLICY WAS GENEROUS ENOUGH I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THEY PROVIDE A NUMBER OF EXTRA AND VARYING PARTS TO ACCOMMODATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSTALLATION SCENARIOS. VERY, VERY GOOD VALUE.PAPA C"
5,Screen Door Lockset,"Product exceeded expectations. The quality is extraordinary. However, be prepared to do some carpentry/mechanical work to get it to fit (mortising, etc) if it doesn't match your brand of door. Non-the-less, I am extremely pleased with the result. A real class act!"
2,A dim view,This is the least expensive place I've found to buy these bulbs and I still feel it is less than a good value. THe bulbs put out a very yellow light and have a fairly short life span. I'd recommend a led or HID before I'd buy another light that used these
4,David Does America,"I bought this disc after seeing David live and I am glad to say that the music has long survived the post-concert infatuation with it. I don't know what to compare it to. Some words that come to find: america, folk, traveling, confession, acoustic, raw, sincerity. He rides Grey Hound buses and trains and writes totally uncontrived songs about the experiences that are definitely not sounding like ""folk"" songs. I sense that he really has a place in his heart for the unconventional stuff that he sings about. If I knew anything about Woody Guthrie, perhaps I would say that he is a modern punk-like version (?) He sings about love (strictly from the heart), too. Awesome."
4,half and half,the first 6 songs are pretty good and real metal sound then the rest are softer adding a little alternitive rock sound which i guess is all right. its like putting the old incubus with the softer incubus cds they have today together. so i wouldnt tell you to go buys this item right away but you should buy it when ever you have a chance
3,Typos Galore,"This is a comprehensive high-level book for someone who is familiar with, but needs more information on supply chain. It covers the major areas with a good level of detail.HOWEVER, there are numerous typos and misspellings. For example, a major table on p.36 has its headings transposed, which leaves the readers trying to guess what the author had in mind. If I'm paying $40-50 for a book, I expect that it would be well-edited."
3,"Decent book, but could be better","I liked the content of the book, but I have three complaints.1. Very large number of charts, graphs and photos which is great, but the book would be much better if they were printed in color instead of black and white.2. The author needs to create a companion CD to supplement the content in the book.3. I wasn't expecting to read a lot of Bible verses when I bought a book on Supply Chain Strategy. The author should have saved those for a different type book - not in a textbook. For this reason, the book is not appropriate for a corporate reading list in a litigious environment."
2,Hoped for more pictures of Swedish Houses,"I'd hoped for more ""Swedish"" and ""House.""The compositions of aged paint and abandoned objects in natural light are beautiful, but not necessarily ""Swedish.""It's mostly rooms. With some shots of fenestration, it contains only about 20 large photos showing the exterior of a whole ""house."""
4,WOW! What a read!,"Wow! I have read oh, 4 of 5 of these books and this was by far my favorite... I might be a little bias as Vaughn is my personal favorite character on the show but learning a litle about him from before he met Syd was a good break from the usual Alias story line, not that I don't love the show, I have never missed an episode since I started watching it mid-season 1, but getting to know Vaughn before Syd Bristow came into his life was a nice change. In this book you really get to know the real Michael Vaughn. I recomend this book to fans and non-fans alike. If you havn't seen the show, you might want to read this and recruited before tuning in. Happy Reading!"
5,Myth and Image in Literature,"Myth and mythic stories, which function to hold the belief systems inherent in all human societies, are the fundamantal elements of virtually all great literature... and all great literature usually contains core elements of multiple mythic systems. Few people are more skilled at finding the timeless myths hidden in the literature of the human experience than Dennis Slattery.Harvesting Darkness is a wonderful collection of essays that do just that: show us elements of the myth themes central and tandential to many of the great works of Western literature.For those who are interested in the such core themes, this book is a must read.Bob Wagner, Houston, Texas"
4,mommy baby body builders,"I realy like this DVD. I was super lazy and did nothing throughout my pregnancy so i found the excersise to be challenging but not impossible. I read a review that said that this DVD was gritty and looked like it was taped on camcorder. I disagree. The backround is calming and senic and besides, it's an excersise tape not Star-Wars, geeze. The only problem I had with MBBB was that i'm a total clutz and needed more time inbetween excersise to get into position. I just paused and got into position and restarted. I also think a person should stretch a little more than they have at the end.My baby realy enjoys this DVD for the most part but we do stop half way for a little break. She also hates tummy time so will get pretty fussy during that part of the DVD but I just keep on because it's good for her and is just enough time so that I don't feel bad about leaving her in that position."
3,"Good excercises, bad production quality","The exercises in this video are good, and the instructors clearly enjoy working out with their babies. However, the production quality is very low (like it was filmed using a low quality VHS video camera), and worst of all I can't play this DVD on my computer (unlike every other DVD I own). Since my computer is in the room where I work out and I don't have a TV/DVD player in that room, and there isn't room to work out in the living room where we have our DVD player, this is a big disappointment for me. Don't buy this DVD if you plan to watch it on your computer."
4,mommy baby body builders is fun,I like this video and so does my baby. It is fun to watch him smile and laugh while I work out. Working out is not chore time it is play time!
1,Not for parents with older kids,"I was really looking forward to this video and hoping it would help me shed some of the baby weight. I bought it too late. I felt that this video was meant for moms with young infants...ones that were not moving around and just want to be held. By the time I bought this, my son wanted to move around. I also felt that the movie was a bit old and not very current."
2,was expecting more,"Based on other reviews, I was expecting a lot better product. I wasn't concerned about the corny music and scenery if the exercises were good, but they did not meet my expectations, either."
1,Big let down,"I really had high hopes for this -- it looked cute, and the idea is good. But it really turned out to be a disappointment. The exercises are not nearly challenging enough, they're not instructed well, and the video is quite short.There are other similar products out there that I use -- and are much better."
5,Phoebe Snow is a First-Rate Talent,"It is difficult to categorize Phoebe Snow's music. Her repertoire encompasses elements of classic-era Motown sounds, smooth jazz, singer/songwriter music, '70s R&B;, traces of black gospel, and much more. Most of the songs she has written or recorded are smoother than urban blues. She excels at love ballads but never resorts to the artless category known as ""easy listening.""Phoebe's deep voice is vibrant and versatile, and her superior intonation allows her to glide through difficult melodies such as ""At Last."" And her improvising skills are considerable as well. She has a tremendous range, and can whisper sweet ballads (""Teach Me Tonight"") and growl R&B; (""Good Times"") with equal skill.The songs on this compilation CD are appealing and the musicianship is superb throughout. Phoebe Snow is a first-rate talent. Anyone who likes good R&B; music will enjoy this excellent recording."
5,The Very Best of Phoebe Snow is a must have !,The Very Best of Phoebe Snow is a wonderful compilation of some of her best songs..The live version of Harpo's Blues alone isworth the purchase.If you are a fan of Phoebe's music you will not bedisappointed.
5,Always with great and profound measages!,"Cat Stevens has always been a favorite with us 60's ... 70""s guys. He has always provided great sounds and lyrics to have people reflect on the establishments evil doings and that humans can be better than that. This CDwill lighten your heart and bring you to tears of joy. Thanks again Yusup."
4,Gentle music from a gentle man...,"Let me start off by saying that if you are expecting a Cat Stevens recording, you might be disappointed in this cd. Obviously there are many similarities; however, there are many differences as well. Yes, there are some religious overtones to a number of songs on this cd, but as I see it, this is a true artist expressing his true sense of being.Would I listen to these songs if they weren't sung by the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens? Probably not.I do, however, recommend this cd, but only to true die-hard fans. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is just new to Yusuf/Cat. Those recommendations are reserved to the albums of the 70s.Peace out."
2,Two stars for the remakes,"It does appear that Yusuf has found a peace in his life and in his music, but at the expense of the power and excitement of that I listened to continually throughout my college career and later. I purchased the cd after reading the glowing reviews but was disappointed after listening. With the exception of some remakes, all of the songs sounded very similar and fairly bland. One reviewer noted that the music got better for him, but I don't think I am motivated enough to listen too many more times in hopes of that solution. I SO love this man's music and this cd just doesn't measure up."
2,not the same,"I remember Cat Stevens as the poet of lyrics and yes the fast moving words to remember. Even though he tried to use some olden songs and jazz them up, it just didn't have the same feel. I knew it would not be as it was 20 plus years ago, but I was hoping for some of the same caliber of celebration songs or even a ""banapple gas"" type would be good. I found neither much. Although mellow and lyrically ok, nothing of the excitement of ""catch bull at four"". I will keep it and play if from time to time, but only because I don't have cd's of the others I have in album form. Sorry Cat, your meow was more ow to me."
3,Bland,"While it is good to hear Cat Stevens' voice again, one can ""feel"" that he is no longer the young singer he once was. The CD does not have any song with the old punch and flavour. It is rather bland, leaving no emotion for nor memory of any of the songs. Unfortunately disappointing."
2,"I'm happy for him, glad for those who like it, but.....","....but...I'm sad to give it just these two stars. I agreed with one of the other two-star commentators. The music is complacent. Pleasant, reasonably well-crafted, but really lacking in the bold uniqueness of vision that Cat brought to his early work. I was really hoping the spiritual focus of his life - and the public attention he garnered in ""coming out"" to the world as a convert to Islam at a time when many Westerners look at Islam with distrust and disdain - would give the music a quality of depth and insight that the best of his past work, as I remember it, held. Instead, he sings in the last song: ""let the wind blow hard, I don't mind."" The songs feel disconnected from the world into which he's sending them out. Perhaps his other Yusuf CD's are different, but I'd imagined more."
5,VERY COOL!,"What a blessing to have this guy,back in my life. He is such an inspiration! I thought I'd never hear anything from Yusuf- (Cat) again, and then, here he is! With the same, if not better music that he blessed us with along time ago.His message, his quality,his voice is better than ever. I am so happy I have lived to hear his ""re-incarnation. Thank you, Yusuf."
4,"It's great to have ""Cat"" back!!!","Although you can hear the inspirational influence in Yusuf's lyrics, the voice is still the same, and the music is like coming home again! Wonderful! Welcome back Cat! I can hardly wait for more!"
5,WOW - amazingly soothing,My favorites are Midday and The beloved (among others of course)Cat is still kicking folks!
1,Let Out the Cat!,"Never mind the weak material here. Cat's made that work before (remember ""Izitso?"") just on the basis of his great, passionate vocals. Remember that ragged edge to his voice pre-Islam? GONE. Remember the omnipresent, ""Ohh--Ohhh--Oh-Awww!"" he used to moan after every line? GONE.Instead you get something that sounds like his quiet voice (""Child with the Moon and Stars on His Head"") material, but more polite. Like a Sunday school teacher would sing.In short: Moood shallow, mood shallow...Footsteps in the dogcrap."
5,Absolutely Cat.,This is the best of the entire Cat Stevens Collection. He is so at peace with himself and his ideal of the world. You are immediately in the presence of a higher being and are awed by his happiness resounding thru his music. Vocals are chrystal clear.Music is soothing and real. All Cat Stevens. You can hear his soul.
3,"alias ""Cat Stevens"" or ""An Other Cup"" Yusuf","I saw Yusuf, nee Cat Stevens, interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning. I used to love the old Cat and having heard a few bars of music from the ""An Other Cup"" album, thought this would be a great gift for my wife. However, it's just another album, no great shakes."
3,Cat On The Rise,"I am a big fan of the artist formerly known as Cat so I was awaiting this release with great anticipation. Although the production here could be better and the track list is thin on purely new material, this album is a definite sign of a comeback. If he would move more towards a world beat sound as he did here on the track featuring Youssou N'Dour, and get away from the lackluster adult contemporary style featured in the pointless cover of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"", his next effort may be much better. His voice is certainly in fine form.Glad you're back Yusuf. Now take a cue from Peter Gabriel, bring back Youssou N'Dour and hire Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's ghost, play it less safe with your lyrics, and you may even surpass your former glory. The incorporation of the Islamic message and style with your personal vision is working fine. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise."
2,new Cat Stevens CD,"Was happy he came out with a new one after all these years, but it wasn't what I was hoping for or expected. My opinion."
2,The Cat Lost His Muse When He Overreacted to A Traumatic Event and Brainwashed Himself,"This album is evidence that although the man that once was Cat Stevens retains his vocal ability and the ability to play music, his extreme religious zealotry (born of an overreaction to almost drowning) has killed the thing that made his work special art, the empathy and appreciation that life is all about the struggle, is gone. We only have true inner peace,Yusuf, when we are dead -- but isn't life also a gift to be savored? Isn't the very essence of life about the highs and lows, sorrow, anger, love, joy, and relating to and sympathizing with your fellowman/woman's struggles and having compassion for human frailties. The music on this album sound like the work of a bland, brainwashed person that is ""so above it all"" that he is in fact the walking dead. Please, Yusuf, your muse is a gift from above, recapture it and your humanity --- LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG!"
3,It's a start!,"Cat Stevens, now Yusuf, was my favorite during the '70s. Still have about everything he's ever recorded. To learn that he had a new CD, I had high hopes. I feel this album is adequate, at best. He's back to at least an attempt at his prior quality, but seemed way out of practice. Some of the tunes tried to incorporate former songs. The fantastic depth of his voice range seemed ho-hum. I'm glad I bought the CD, but don't see any possibilities of hit singles here. But I hope he keeps at it, because when he's at his best, there's none better."
3,He's Back - Sort Of,"On first listen I made the mistake of anticipation and expected to find what would become another all time classic song from this artist and found myself skipping through the tracks waiting for that classic to appear.......unfortunately to me it doesnt.Then on second listen I simply let the CD ride and enjoyed it for what it is.Having listened to it many many times since my opinion is thats its a nice comeback CD that does sound a little cheesy and dated in places but by the same token its actually a very enjoyable listen. The voice is the same,the passion is back and many of these songs grow on you after repeated listens.I am sure we are in for more pleasant surprises in future releases but in the meantime this is a good start as long as you are not looking for a ""Father & Son"".Im glad he's back !!"
5,Another Cup of Cat Stevens,"Millions of fans worldwide cherish every lyric in his songs, dozens of his fellow artists and songwriters have covered those songs; so, whether you call him Yusuf Islam or Cat Stevens, the man needs no introduction.AN OTHER CUP, is a rich selection of twelve beautiful songs, all but one penned by the minstrel himself. Yusuf's rendition of the classic ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" --previously done by both Nina Simone and the Animals-- is poignant and a good one, considering the misunderstandings and bigotry over his conversion to Islam decades ago and the vilification he has had to suffer for naively supporting Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against author Salman Rushdie."
3,"Sad, Slow Sounds...","I became interested in the CD after seeing a news short on Yusuf Islam, formerly ""Cat"" Stevens. I was impressed by his honesty and sincerity, and his descriptions of his songs after his decades-long hiatus piqued my interest. I must confess that I was a bit disappointed. His voice is as rich and sure as ever, but his material is dirge-like. I guess I'm used to a mix of tempo and subject matter from an artist...the only exception is his cover of the song ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"" and even this song is slow and measured. These songs may reflect his contentment with his lifestyle and philosophy, but they are not the songs of a happy soul. Still and all, I will just consider this a first effort of a ""new"" artist, and hope that his next effort reflects the passion and fire I used to love."
4,Cat Stevens??,This new CD is enjoyable easy listening music. If you are a Cat Stevens fan it is not quite him. A different sound but not a bad one. I am ejoying it. But will always love Tea for the Tillerman.
4,Don't expect pop-star Cat....,"If you were expecting Moonshadow or Peace Train, then you're stuck in the ""pop star"" Stevens. True Cat Stevens fans were more about his message rather than the pop sensation. This effort will not enter the Top 40, but a refreshing look back at the singer.I tried to match this album to past others, and it was difficult. The front resembles Mona Bone Jakon and the inner jacket resembles the Buddha & the Chocolate Box sessions.In any event, his voice is about the same, just older like all of us. Nice first effort after 30 years, let's see the next."
5,peaceful,"I`ve been listening to this CD since it arrived.. Both the music and the lyrics are very beautiful, peaceful and uplifting... It is a great purchase if you want to uplift your moods and start your day happily.."
4,Glad Cat is Back,"I have always been a big Cat Stevens fan, and was sorry to see him disappear for so long. This is a worthy return, nice mellow melodies with hints of the old Cat - distinctive riffs and piano that reminds you of the old days."
1,Huge disappointment!,"Like other reviewers, I am a huge Cat Stevens fan and was thrilled to hear this was coming out. But not only are the songs weak, but even his voice doesn't sound very good -- in fact, he frequently sounded shaky and off-key to me. Even the best song was only decent, not great, and its main merits were good background orchestration, mixing and production, rather than good songwriting and singing by him! As someone else said, the lyric-writing seemed lazy, frequently just repeating the same line monotonously. I would have thought his record label would want his ""comeback"" to be a powerhouse, rather than this perfunctory and lame disc. I hope he does better next time."
2,An Other Cat,"Still the familiar sound of the ""old Cat,"" but this new cd doesn't cut it like in the old days. Nice lyrics and concept, but not what you'd hear on the radio all the time."
2,A Disappointment,"How I've missed Cat Stevens, and how I looked forward to this album as a chance to reconnect. From the reviews, I expected something of the old musical spirit, but the songs are forgettable, the arrangements uninspired, and most disappointing of all, the voice is weak. He sings all the songs in a half-whisper, and even sometimes a bit off tune. I will probably not play it again, but will return to the exciting and moving earlier albums, with the strong, passionate voice he sang in then."
1,Charlie from Mpls,"this was not good, in fact I gave it away after many plays, His voice is still great but he needs some one else to write his songs!"
3,Oh Very Old..,To be fair I must admit that I have only watched the video of one of the songs and was not impressed. I was a big Cat fan back in the 70's having seen him live on the MagiCat tour. His early works were amazing to be sure but when he did IzItSo things started falling apart for me. Back then it was obvious that he was involved in finding himself and seemed to run out of meaningful things to say. I guess we shouldn't be surprised that a release some 30 years later would prove to be very average. He would be better served to do covers of his old songs perhaps updated somehow and reincluding Alun Davies. Boy when Cat was on top of it there was nobody in the business any better...the cool cat indeed. I really miss those days.
1,Why not something new?,"After 30 years of being a Cat Stevens fan, I expected something wonderfully new and touching. Instead, I found revisitations of old stuff with an orchestral back-up, and not nearly enough of his sweet voice and guitar. The entire thrust of this album is ""Yeah, I'm spiritual, and I've got a girlfriend."" It took him 30 years to find that out? Paleeeeze...."
3,Makes a 5-7 team look half decent!,"I got the tape because I love the Rams. NFL Films does its usual great job of catching the incredible images. I sort of get tired of the music. They used it in their other team yearbook videos. This is a MUST BUY for all true Ram fans. The Team finished 5-7. In the future, how else are you going to see these highlights? ESPN will never show them. Better get them now, so you can enjoy them later. The tape tries to pump up the team, by just showing the good parts. Some good plays, they show from different angles, trying to pretend it was a different play! I buy the tapes every year. And at the start of each season I break them out and watch them all. Oh yes, the price is very good. If only the Rams were!"
5,Van and the Prelude in D,"I came across this recording long ago and have recently come back to it. The Sonata is good, the sound isn't. The reason to get this disk for me is the Prelude in D. Its a lovely piece, and under Van's hands and mind, a very lovely thing indeed!!"
3,fell apart,I bought the Silver Griffon and Black Griffon together last year. Good books but both fell apart before I was done reading them.
4,Brilliant!,I usually dislike murder mysteries because the authors can't do intrigue. Never would have guessed that all they needed was a little fantasy in the mix!
4,A good whodunit,"I agree with the ""reader from the Good Ol' US of A."" Just because it doesn't have action from start to finish doesn't mean it's a dud. It's a good murder-mystery set in an exotic location and just HAPPENS to have gryphons and mages in the cast of characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!"
5,It's very awsome and entertaining! I couldn't put it down!,"I got the book from a thrift store,surprised someone would giveit away.The best book I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Not bad, but not good","i loved the black gryphon, it was in fact one of my all time favourites, so i was estatic when i was about to read the sequel(thanx to my big bro'). well, i was a bit disappointed. there wasnt the drama or the pace of the first book, and i was looking forward to seeing more of aubri, who was my favourite character. i was more than a little disappointed to see how little of it actually dealt with wars, and much of the political stuff went over my head. there were the good points too though, including the prospects of change, and the flare of seeing the black gryphon back. all i can say is that i definitely wanted to read the silver gryphon after that! its worth the time though, and the 400 pages were great all the way."
4,Definately worth it!,"It was only a penny and there is only a page with a minor tear in it and everything else looks brand new. Yup, I am definately happy =)"
2,Very dull,"While the Black Gryphon was interesting and the Silver Gryphon outstanding, I found this book to be very dull. When people from White Gryphon go and meet the Black Kings they wind up in a mess of rules, regulations and protocol. This book is all about politics and has a very weak plot. It is like a third rate movie sequel. I usually love Lackey's work but she misses on this one. Better luck next time!"
1,waste of time,"After the Black Gryphon, I was expecting something better. This book strikes me as something churned out with little effort and less imagination. The narrative voice is so heavy the reader cannot suspend disbelief and get into the story! But there is not much of a story to get into. It may appear fresh to the 16 and under crowd, but anyone who can drive will be putting this down to watch sitcom reruns (and be glad they did)."
3,"Change, For Better or Worse","In this follow up of The Black Gryphon, the Kaled'a'in must convince the Haighlei that they are worthy allies. I thought this was a pretty good book althought I don't really enjoy murder stories. Although there is plenty of action, there are also alot more political issues and isites in to the characters views. Lackey uses a combination of the main characters to get different view points. This technique is also very effective in keeping the reader interested. Lackey also gives and interesting view on ""change"" and how humans react to it. The book wasn't quite as good as The Black Gryphon but it was still good."
5,This book is the bomb!!!!!!,This is a very good book. It is filed with lots of action and suspense. This book is a must for Star Wars fans everywhere!
3,It seemed like a good book untill the end,At the end it got confusing and it didn't seem like the book really ended. I think it was set up that way for you to buy the book LEIA'S COURTSHIP which is the continuation of the book. I would discourage people who would only read this book and no others not to read it.
3,Disappointing; not worth the wait,"Solo Command was not as good as ""Wraith Sqadron"". It just wasn't as funny. Still, if you've read the other Wraith books, you need to read this one."
4,A must read!,This is defenetley a good read. It follows in the tradition of all the other books in the X-Wing series.
3,Bre's,"This book follows in the tradition of it's tweo predessors. It is funny, but also meaningful. Allston has done a very good job in setting the stage for The Courtship of Princess Leia. The author sets the characters on their paths and pretty much leaves them to live their own lives. If you liked the X-Wing books, than read this one."
5,the funniest one yet,"This must have been the funniest and most enjoyable of the series. Keep up the good work, guys!"
1,Is this really the same Lilys??,"This is probably the worst album I've ever purchased. I don't understand how this can be the same band that made Better Can't Make Your Life Better, Services...., and The 3-Way. I am under the sneaking suspicion that it is not the same band... This album is completely boring. It is the wrost attempt at electronica/ synth I have ever heard. If you are a fan of the Lily's Kinks/Zombies sound, you will ost likely hate this with a burning fiery hate of fire."
3,We are born to talk and this book proves it.,"Most parents think that teaching their kids to talk is the one thing they got right. This book springs the knowledge on us that talking is as natural as walking. The book offers proof and even defines where in the brain lies the innate talking rules.The book is valuable for what it teaches, but it's explanations and demonstrations to prove its points are lengthy and repetitive. Unless there will be a test, feel free to skim many of the chapters."
5,EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE HYDRATION AND PROTECTION,"A dermatologist and dermatological surgeon Dr. Dennis Gross has introduced many products that have proven beneficial to millions - count me among the multitudes.I've been a huge fan of his sunscreen which I found gave my fair skin the ultimate protection and later tried his Hydra-Pure Moisture Cream. This is a rich, luxurious formulation for use both in the morning and before bedtime. It offers really intense hydration with absolutely no greasiness. Thus, makeup can be applied after use without blotting or removing any residue.Infused with antioxidants to promote collagen and an Essential Oil (Lavender, Evening Primrose, Olive Oil and Sweet Almond Oil), Hydra-Pure Moisture Cream not only hydrates but it also protects and soothes.A lovely way to begin the day and end it!- Gail Cooke"
3,More field of view,"these are good binoculars but for 7x magnification,it could have way more field of view.the bushnell excursion 8x36 243608 has more power and more fied of view."
1,the wiew quality is not as seen on adverts,the compass rewiew is on the left side of the binocular is making the hazy image....
4,Bushnell Marine 7X50 binocular,"I was hesitant to order these because binoculars are so varied in price and quality it is difficult to buy them without trying them out first. I have a pair of 12X50 Pentax that I paid over $200 for but these Bushnell binocs exceed them for clarity and quality, and priced at half the Pentax. I do a lot of fishing so I am out on the ocean waters of S.E. Alaska almost every day, and these 7X50 Marine work perfectly on the water. I especially like the built in compass which can be illuminated at the press of a button for near dark navigation. I would recommend these to any boater who wants a binocular that performs well, and doesn't put a big hole in your wallet.....thanks Bushnell!.....N. Smith Haines,Alaska"
5,great for on the water,"bought these as a christmas present for the boat. They really work very wellI was a little skeptical because of the price, but pretty much Bushnell has alway beena good product. I would recommend these for every boater."
4,Animation for the Post ADD generation,"Of the 4 tapes available this one has two of the funniest episodes and the best sense of what the charm of the series was really all about: From the random quotes from ""The Litany Against Fear"" to the whacked use of Fondu Forks this is Animation for those of us who thought Max Headroom was just our speed back in the eighties. -Manic, Random and Post-Modern, Highly recomended"
4,Good Read,I bought this for my lil brother but I read it first. Very inspirational to young men if you can get them to read it. I'd recommend it!
4,Great Writer,"I could only give it a four though because it seems to be directed specifically at black young men and that is a shame...it should be for EVERY young man to read. The reason I say this was I am in college to learn to teach art k. - 12 and as a white person I was given the task of acquainting myself with black culture so i could teach black children, per them, more effectively. I have a young son and 4 brothers, all white, and I can tell you that this is the same advice any color man would give to any color child. I also have cousins who are mixed. OUTSTANDING BOOK. ...and I hope the marketing changes to emphasis our similarities, not our differences. ...I am just speaking to the marketing because Mr. Harper presents men and women of all colors for young people to emulate, including John Kennedy...my black uncle was with Robert Kennedy the night before he died. Mr. Harper your book is just great."
5,Good book for any young man,"My teenaged grandson wasn't at all enthusiastic when I gave him this book. Even after I made him read a few pages, and gave him the option of finishing or not depending on if he liked it, he put it down. But then, a few days later, I noticed he was mentioning things in the book and bringing up subjects covered by Mr. Harper. He admitted he had been reading it and it was 'pretty good', which translates to 'excellent'. I like the fact that you can read a few pages or open it to anywhere and just start reading something of interest. It motivates them to go back and start at the beginning so they don't miss anything. It might also give parents a jumping off place to start some needed conversations."
3,- Okay for young male teens,"Purchased the book with the intention of giving as a high school graduation gift to 2 gentlemen. Wish I had read it myself first. The book has some salient points, but it's much too juvenile for a graduating senior. It's much better suited for young boys, 8th or 9th grade. I gave the books as gifts anyway, but I don't believe these young men will be able to glean a lot of good information."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR SINGLE MOTHERS,"I just finished reading this book and I am purchasing copies for all the males in my family. I have called everyone to rave over the greatness of this book. This will be the first of my sons summer reading material.In my opinion, this will be a book that young men should keep throughout their lives! Thank you Mr. Harper for taking interest in our young men and giving them something to reach for...Their own DESTINY!!!!"
4,good,I think was very informative. I can actually share some of the experiences to someone else. It perpared me for future experiences that I might come in contact with.
4,Hill Harper to the rescue,"This book was very informative as well as entertaining. What a positive role model Hill is for young men. I bought this book for my little brother but decided to read it before I gave it to him & I'm glad I did. I'm a woman and I found the book to be interesting, helpful & a sheer treat. Hill Harper gets 4 stars from me with this book!!!"
5,A Must Read for Young Black Men,I purchased this book to preview and pass on to the youngsters in my family.
4,I Appreciate...,"Hill Harper wanting to reach out and make a difference in young men's lives and minds. His doing so, says a lot about his character. This book, in addition to, Mister Mann Frisby's ""Holla Back, but Listen First"" are great gifts for young men."
4,Great Book,"Great Job Hill Harper. I purchased four of them, one for each of my sons, a male friend (Harvard MD) and myself. Full of reality and realism."
3,Odds and ends,"As the other reviewer mentions, this CD is the last of the Ligeti Project and collects several miscellaneous works and arrangements (with a wide variety of performers as well). I would've much rather seen a new work on here, rather than the 20 minutes spent on Aventures and Nouvelles Aventures again - nevertheless, it's a good performance of a bizarre 'vocal' work sure to have you laughing out loud. The Sonata for Cello Solo is excellent, and contrary to the other reviewer, I find the ballroom dances delightful. Artikulation for tape is short and curious. It's nothing on Xenakis.This certainly isn't a bad CD, it just isn't nearly as good as some of the other volumes. I'd get it just because I'm a completist - but I wouldn't regret buying it, either."
1,Disappointing,"I got this book immediately upon its release. Quite a bit of information in the book is wrong, and the lack of good directions and maps made this book difficult to use. I would recommend Rick Kennedy's ""Little Adventures in Tokyo."""
3,Almost,"This was more of a novel for me than an Introduction to Universal Mysteries. It was a good read, and I recommend it. But It did not have a lot on real universal Mysteries for me."
1,Silliness,"There are some books that are so simply elegant that they leave a profound and lasting mark, often quite beautiful, on your life.This is NOT one of those books for me.The writing is so poor due to translation problems, and the message is truthfully so banal, that it simply isn't worth the read, unless you view the book as humor.I hate to say it, but will anyway... I found myself laughing out loud because of the grammar of the translation, it sounds so stereotypical...I'm sorry, but this book really needs a new translation, it borders on silly to read it as is. I couldn't keep from laughing, and maybe that's the point after all.I gave it 1 star because it is impossible to give it no stars."
1,are you serious?,"You have got to be joking, how did this even get published? So we don't even exist we are all sound waves bouncing around off of each other? what a bunch of garbage! Talk about your blind faith!!!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"Don't bother wasting time on this garbage. This book needs to be labeled correctly to avoid innocent bystanders from being lured into the world of Allah. I'm surprised this trash doesn't give you a free trip to the Holy Land to complete your ""ritualistic"" transformation. Islamic recruitment at its best. Avoid at all costs."
3,"Incredibly fun,but Waaaaay too short.","Reviewer:AdrielThis 007 game has everything for a shooter,car chases,stealth action and cool gadgets.But waaaaay too short.Graphics:4/5Audio:very realistic,5/5Gameplay:Fun but short:4/5replayability:3/5fustration:2/5You should go for the longer 007 games."
2,"decent, but very short","This game is fairly fun to play while it lasts, but that ain't long. I spent between two to three hours playing the game and then it was over. Certainly not worth $30.00. I bought the game today and am trading it in tomorrow."
4,very fun!! but.,"this game gets 5stars because its interesting and better than nightfire which sucks (you cant aim,messed up graphics).the bad part of everything or nothing is that you only get three guns,theres only eight levels which are very easy(i beat it in three days)and there are gadgets you dont ever use.if you want an easy game thats cool and easy to control buy this one. p.s. if you get a certian amount of points you unlock a very fun blackjack minigame."
4,Great readings,What I like about this recording is that they are all by interpreted by one artist--Gerhard Oppitz. He is a fine pianist and I especially like his Brahms. Well done.
2,Not the best collection for piano music,"If you would like to try some piano music. Do not get this one.This CD is not emotional, not rhythmic, not insipiring, and, the most important, not relaxing indeed. I don't know what feelings this CD gives you!So try other piano albums, never try this."
2,This was very small,"This was very small. It was not as it is descibed 'large'. Otherwise, my dog loved it. He ate it up quickly."
3,Dog thinks this is so-so,"I've got an AmStaff/GSD mix that loves to chew. He likes this, but it's hard for him to get all of the filling out, so it's only something to decides to go after when he's really bored. I think next time I'll get him the smaller size so he can clear out the filling and I can refill it with peanut butter as others have suggested. He's had it about a month and there is still a lot of filling inside he can't reach, and at the price, it just isn't worth it. I'm not sure exactly what sort of dogs these really long filled bones are marketed for, but it's certainly not a dog like mine."
3,They don't tell you this is artificial bone which is why I gave both of these flavors 3 stars.,Although they don't tell you it is made of artificial bone it is very good if your dog's gums bleed from regular bones. This bone comes off in tiny round pellets which indicates they go through the digestive system safely and don't cut your dog. But the dogs don't get excited about chewing fake bone so once they get all the gel filling they can reach they stop chewing. My Great Pyrenees mix did manage to crack the bone as well as chew off both ends. He lost interest after that because he couldn't get to any more of the flavored gel the bone is filled with. .
4,Delightful blends,"As usual, the delightful blending of voices is most evident in this CD, I especially liked ""Symphony for Susan"" amd ""Touch Me in the Morning/The Way We Were."" Pure enjoyment and great memories."
4,Lettermen hits 2,"I did'nt care much for the Lettermen whenI was growing up, I thought their soundwas a little to Elevator musicish. But withall of the tension in the world to day,acually this music songs very nice. Theyare the original boy band. Their soundpreceded the Beach Boys. My fav,tracksare their covers of 'It's all in the game'and 'Venus'."
3,A parent counseling session,"This book is moderately useful especially if you are unsure of your parenting practices. The main content of the book seems to focus on the outlook of the parent toward the ADD child. There are many worksheets that can help parents to figure out where they stand on the issues at hand (especially the issue of medication). If you are confident in your parenting practices then...well, this is no more valuable than a counseling session."
2,Not very durable,"I purchased this desk lamp a little over a year ago. Within six months the plastic knob for the switch broke. This lamp was not treated roughly, just daily use caused the plastic part of the switch to break. The shade part does not stay put. With any type of movement, the shade part constantly falls off. I would not recommend this lamp."
3,A Little Disappointed,"The lamp is nice looking but the lamp shade does not fit very tightly. It can drop off with any movement at all, even a slight brush against the base. The lamp looks just like the photo and the price was right. Overall, okay but not super."
2,Won't stay attached,"This water filter worked fine for about a week. Then it started falling off the faucet. The nylon ring that attaches it to the faucet doesn't have the strength to hang on.I love the way this thing works, when it does. The auto shutoff for filtered water is very useful, as is the pressure wash feature. Too bad it won't stay on.Took it back to the store and we're looking for a different kind."
2,faucet filter makes a mess,"If I had reviewed this within six months of buying it I probably would have said it was ok. But, after a while it started spraying where the filter connects and made a real mess. Changing the filter worked for a few weeks but then it did it again. I gave one to my mother and hers did the same thing. I ended up ditching it and bought a counter top model by Aquafina."
1,Doesn't fit regular faucet,"I bought a new Moen faucet and tried to attach this filtration system. The system came with two attachments for the internal attachment of the faucet. Both were the same size but different colors, and neither of them actually fit the faucet. They were both too small. I didn't have this problem with other systems, so this one must only work for people who have external attachments."
1,Check the reviews for Instapure F-8 White Water Filter System,Check the reviews for the Amazon product Instapure F-8 White Water Filter Systemat the associated link (WaterPik just adds its name and boosts the price). It looks like this faucet attached system has the same problem as all the BRITA and PUR faucet attached systems ... the faucet attachment is not robust and starts leaking after a couple months of normal usage.Instapure F-8 White Water Filter System
1,Missing a crucial part,"Bought this for my daughter at Christmas, she didn't want it. I tried to install it and it seemed impossible. I wrote to the seller and they claimed it was so easy. I put it back in the box, and waited months till I just moved, and tried to install it at my new place. It is missing the part the adapts to the faucet, so it's worthless. Furthermore, it doesn't filter our fluoride, which is a poison. (If you don't know this, look at on your toothpaste tube--says if you ingest fluoride, to call poison control. Or watch some youtube videos about fluoride.) So with shipping and handling, I spent about $35 and it will be going in the trash. How hard is it to ship all the parts when there's only about 5 of them? Also, the directions are just drawings, so good luck figuring them out even if you get all the parts. There is some flat piece too that I wouldn't have a clue what to do with."
2,screw in part fel of,"I used this hanger entire bow season and seem to work fine untill at the end of season,when i hung my bow on it, fel down with my compound bow because scred in part came of disattached,crewed my hunting day at that moment))should stop making every thing in china, can't we make hanger in USA ? aren't we super poweR?piece"
5,great product!!,A great product.. every bowhunter should have 3 or 4 ..one for every stand. Very durable and easy to use
3,Nice,Good all natural product. Something new I'm trying after using Guinot Refreshing Toning Lotion for an extended period of time. Not sure how I feel about it quite yet. It's rose smell is much more fragrant than the Guinot yet still refreshing.
1,Digitally Remastered - A REAL LIE!!!!,"As a longtime devotee of Silent films (prior lecturer at MoMA), I was quite pleased to see this ""Digitally Remastered/Sound Enhanced"" disc available. Those in the know are aware that Betty is a take-off on Clara Bow, THE Flapper. Anyway, took the disc out to view and was appalled to see the faded/running colors, the scratches, the 'rips', and the dust balls on the frame edges. In other words - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I am writing to AMC and TV Guide to let them know that their names are used on the packaging of this shoddy item. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I would also advise everyone to avoid buying anything else from ""Genius Entertainment/Classic Cartoons"" as they are probably just as poorly made. Guess, I'll just have to play 'frisbee' with this disc as it is useful for nothing else, especially not any good for viewing."
1,He just rushed it out - jumbled and poorly constructed,The first book was well written and kept one's interest - but the second fell flat. Makes me think he had a deadline to make and just typed enough words to get the book published. The story disintegrated about midway through. I usually really enjoy Gene Wolfe's writing - I would like to see him go back and do a good version of this book someday.
2,Unlikeable characters,"This book may be better than it's first 100 pages or so that I've slogged through, becoming increasingly disinterested until - oh look, a shiny object in the shape of ANYTHING else - distracts me. I'm a fast reader and have omnivorous tastes. So far I dislike the main character, have no respect for his mentor, and find all of the supplemental characters dim-witted at best. I want this book to pick up and become worth having had faith that it would become interesting based on the odd juxtaposition of the two worlds the author is building, but it's just not happening. Maybe one day I'll be hard up for something to read on a plane and will finish it, but it's unlikely."
3,Not as good as the first book,"I like the first book in this series immensely. Unfortunately this one did not hold my interest as much. The story line switched between characters and sub plots in a confusing way, and after the first third of the book I found myself not caring what happened next."
1,a wandering mess,"I'm a longtime fan of Wolfe; the disorientation you feel as a reader when something unexpected and unexplained happens is refreshing. But I found this book to be sloppy in the construction of the narrative and in the proofreading. Apparently even his editor couldn't make it through a careful reading of the book and catch the spelling mistakes. The world and mythology that Wolfe construct are so confusing and uncompelling that I finally gave up on the book, even though I was only 50 pages from the end."
2,complete nonsense,"Ok, I admit it. I read the first volume and disliked it. So what made me read the second one? Well, I guess I wanted to know if the character of Able would finally grow up to be a responsible man and not just a teenager's dream. Because that's want it reads like. The interaction between the characters are just absurd. I realize that some people really enjoyed that book (I just don't know why) and that taste obviously very different..."
4,Loses a lot of steam but finishes strong,"This one is a good deal slower than the first.I didn't like the fact that Gene Wolfe leaves Abel's story in the beginning (after how wonderfully full of promise it was at the end of the first book)in preference of Toug's. The first half of the book is agonizingly slow because of this, and when Abel does finally make his return the book remains very slow during the Utgard chapters. Once they escape from the vortex of Utgard the story becomes ten times better and finishes very powerfully.Worth the read if only for the last half of the book."
1,Don't waste your money..!!,This video is old. Shows some of the things you can do. The hilicopter ride at Ocho Rios in 2006 was $380 US 2 people 30 minutes. Buy any of the Jamaican guide books for one third the price of the video.
4,Great way to get started on your co-op hunt,"This book has a lot of great details on how to think about buying (and living in) a co-op in New York City. 2 caveats come to mind:1) Book is much more suited for you if you're buying in Manhattan. Many of the co-ops in Brooklyn I researched didn't quite match what I expected based on this book.2) Though condos are mentioned in the title, the book is really more about co-ops... look elsewhere for details on buying a condo."
3,NYC Co-op,"This is a comprehensive, overly detailed, encyclopedia of what one needs to know before purchasing a co-op in NYC. Worth the read if you're going to enter the marketplace and spend a significant amount of money; but, it is not an easy read. The editors and author should explore ways to maintain the comprehensiveness of the book and synthesize the content."
1,Awful...,"I generally like the Countdown Kids, but I threw this CD away. It's a low-budget production. Not worth the money. Go with the Crayola Christmas production by the Countdown Kids."
3,Gentle Dolphin Movies,"I first saw these films when I was in elementary school. I saw them with my family at the $1.00 drive-in several years apart. We dragged grandma along. Seeing them again brought back more than just memories of the films themselves. They are very pleasant, realistic live-action movies, with enough adventure and gentle peril to keep them interesting. The family label does not mean saccharin or boring, however. Their message of protecting wildlife and ecology are perhaps more relevant today than when they were made in the early-mid 60's. Two for one packaging at a reduced price is also great. You can't go wrong with this DVD!"
3,Works Just Fine,"We bought ours at Target in December 2007. It only cost $11 there, not the $[...] that they're charging on Amazon right now.Works just fine for us. You can make a small cup of ice in less than a minute. The kids love it.However, it comes with 1 flavor-aid packet, and it tastes great if you follow the instructions. But I can't find flavor-aid anymore. I've followed the same recipe with Kool-Aid packets, but they Kool-Aid syrup just doesn't taste the same.It's a fun toy for less than $15, but if you pay $[...], you might feel like you've been ripped off."
5,Great Purchase!,My daughter and I enjoy making sno-cones with this classic Snoopy Sno-Cone maker. It is very durable and easy to clean.Please note: It is not easy for little children to turn the crank in order to shave the ice and will most likely require an older sibling or adult assistance!
1,"Do yourself a favor, Buy a blender","After 15 minutes of knuckle-busting fun trying to shave ice faster than it melts; you realize you not only have shaved ice but the added bonus of shredded red plastic mixed right in! (Wonder if that is for flavor or texture?)Luckily, we noticed it before the kids ate it.Buy a blender and put some Snoopy stickers on it and have fun enjoying a real sno-cone with the kids."
5,Wall mount projector screen review,This is an amazing screen and got it for a great price.Looks nice and works great. Was shipped fast as well.
4,Works well,Have used the screen only a few times. It has a good finish and the spring mechanism works as it is supposed to do.
2,extremely inadequate packaging,The metal housing for the screen was bent in 3 places due to inadequate packaging. The screen itself was not damaged but the metal case looks like I found it at a garage sale. I would be willing to pay a few more $ for a heavier corrugated carton to prevent damage.
4,"Serviceable, good for the price","It's a big ol' screen for a relatively small amount of money. A little too big for my projector setup, actually. It was easy enough to install with just a screwdriver, a stud finder and a level. Mine seems to be wrinkling a bit, developing the slightest waves in the picture, though that might just be because I leave it hanging all the time and don't roll it back up. Of course, I only do this because it's (initially) a nightmare to get it to go back in. The few first times I've tried to adjust it I became extremely frustrated. I think I'm getting better at it, though. The trick is to keep constant tension in the screen when you pull down and let it go back up at a constant speed. You have to be extremely smooth while doing this or the screen will catch and you'll have to try a couple of times before you can get it to roll back up again. Anyway, as I've said in the title it's a serviceable screen and when you consider the price it becomes a pretty darn good one."
5,Can't beat it for the price,"My screen arrived in perfect condition with decent packaging. The screen is nice and bright and, as long as you mount it level, it's a nice flat surface. I mounted it to my drywall with anchors and it looks to be sturdy enough. The room isn't large enough for my image to reach the edges of the screen where the black is but it's not a problem. At the current price this is a great deal. Pull down feels heavy and smooth. It goes back up with no problems. It comes with a cord to attach if you can't reach the handle."
5,Great Screen - Great price!,"The title says it all. This is a solid projector screen and was very easy to install. GREAT price, only cost me $50 and it's made in the U.S.A. so I'm putting money back in to my own economy. Win-Win-Win scenario in my opinion."
3,"It smells, liteally.",This product emits a strong paint-drying type chemical odor out of the box! It is good otherwise but I could do without the smell. -- IV
4,Great Screen,Great screen size and picture quality. The model b by DaLite comes highly recommended and for good reason. Very good price for the quality. The only downsize is that it is long and slender so it might come damaged in shipping as mine did. It will have a tendency to crease right in the middle. Just pay attention to that when it comes in and keep your paperwork.
4,Bright and Solid for the price,"A nice bright screen for the price. The screen is not 100% flat, but that does not seem to affect the picture. I am using this screen for a DLP Projector and it works just fine. For this size of screen this is the best price you will get. I paid under $60.00 with free shipping. You can't beat that."
1,Disappointed,The pulldown mechanism broke after just 2 weeks! I only used the screen about 10 times. Very disappointed.
5,It works,"Pretty straight forward; arrived in one piece, no damage and it works, although my wife has trouble pulling it to make it go back up, but she has trouble with window shades too so I think that's her issue and not the projection screen."
4,Stinky perfection,"I really do like this screen a lot although it has some problems here and there. The screen has what everyone already knows the ""new screen"" smell. It will wear off eventually so I would say that's a big problem. One of the more important problems is that the screen is a little difficult in rolling up. If you are a patient person that wants to spend a little amount of money, this is your screen."
5,Excellent product and price. Great quality!!!!,"I got this delivered in one day from Amazon via Ontrac(Courier service). Loved the item, was extremely easy to install. Works great and picture looks perfect. I have a 1080p projector and it looks amazing. Plus the price is amazing!!!!!!"
4,Thank you,There was nothing wrong with this product we had to send it back because it looked too small in our theater room so we had to send it back. I love ordering from Amazon and I will keep coming back.
1,An aggravation I don't need.,"The screen pulls down and work fine, but when you're done it stays down. Or acts like it might go up but doesn't. Maybe halfway and goes no further. Or maybe not.I don't need to ""learn"" how to make it work. It just doesn't. It you buy this, I suggest you plan on leaving it in the down position."
4,Sherri King does it again...,"Sherri L King, one of the undisputed QUEENS of Ellora's Cave Romantica publishing, does it again with this second book of a series. The MoonLust books (4 right now, with a 5th in the works) create a world of cross-genre fiction that pulls you into the characters and their lives. Her writing is cross-your-legs-attack-your-husband-do-not-read without-a-fresh-supply-of-batteries HOT, and even though this book can stand alone... you will want to buy the other three and start emailing Ms. King to finish the fifth NOW!! If you like Erotic Romance (or Romantica as it is being called), Werewolves, Alpha Men, Strong Female Leads, and happy endings... this is a book for your keeper shelf (or Keeper Document file as the case may be). Ms. King also writes ""The Horde Wars"" series (about a demon fighting race of men and the women who kick butt with them), and some Vampire tales (with some cool twists)! Check out her other series at Ellora's Cave"
5,Loved this CD!,I would recommend this beautiful orchestration of the Bible in song to every family! And no one is too young or old to appreciate this.
5,Evolution and what the top scientists think,"The struggle for Darwin's soul is an enlightening volume of the thinking surrounding top scientist in the field of evolutionary biology and the controversies encompassed within.Darwinism is presented here in this text in all its glory. The ideas of natural selection are put forth along with the ideas of the various 'players' in the field of evolution such as Niles Eldridge and John Maynard-Smith This is not a book focusing on the tired debate between creationist and evolutionists, but instead on the known facts and the actual process of evolution."
1,Can't see the forest for the trees?,"Morris' book is just another example of the worthless rhetoric that is put forth surrounding the controversial subject of evolution. Evolution, outside of limited variation, is NOT a fact. This book is dripping with ignorance. Invest your money in a coloring book - it's much more educational."
3,"Cheap as they get, but you're probably better off with spending a few bucks","Just bought this product and I am already looking to upgrade. The screen is fine, and it is not hard to install, it's just that the pull-back mechanism (so that the screen can roll up) is not very strong and it is quite difficult to get it to up all the way."
5,Good screen for the money,"I purchased this screen for use in one of our classrooms at church. It is a relatively small room so the size worked well. There was a bit of a chemical odor to the screen that was noticeable of a few days after installation. I was aware of this from the reviews here on amazon, so I installed it early in the week and left the screen extended to air-out some until the classroom was occupied on the following Sunday. The chemical smell had dissipated quite a bit by then and is no longer a problem at all after four months of use. There is a bit of a trick to retracting the screen, but it is explained in the owners manual. To retract the screen, you must pull it all the way down first. After learning that technique, retraction is easy.Overall, we're very satisfied with this screen.Dennis"
4,Great Screen for the cost,"I've ordered many Da-Lite screens for the school districts I support. out of all of them, i've only had one break on me(spring un-coiled) Even though buy.com was supposed to take care of the RMA(and did) the company offered to take care of it, if buy.com did not. Da-Lite answered their support mail withing 24 hours and communication was great!!"
5,Beautiful,"This has become my favorite title to enjoy when the day is long, the work is endless...or the evening is quiet, there is a great bottle of wine waiting and a wonderful meal. How I wish I had discovered Buhlig earlier, he is an amazing pianist."
3,Very good History on Tooele County,Wow was excited to see this listed on Amazon and to see here that somw are also available. Love this book as it has a wealth of information for me and my family history. My problem is the cost that everyone wants for this book. I had one and lost it to a massive wildfire that took out my entire neighborhood. I lost everything and my 25 years of Geneology research went with the house. I just can't afford to pay so much for this book. I also went to the Tooele Museum website to see if they still sold them and they don't. Very sad that the cost is so much and your price is the least amount of them all. So I guess I'm out of luck on purchasing this book. It is however the best book on Tooele County history that I have ever found.
2,No new information,I'm surprised this book received so many high reviews. It's not a bad book. It just seemed to me that all this information was previously available. I could have saved the $18 and found out everything with some minimal research on the internet.
3,"Good Book, Patterns Not.","Over all this is a good book if you want easy to sew dogwear. The only objection I have is that the patterns aren't your typical sewing patterns. They're just diagrams and you have to bring them to scale your self. Some of the projects are good though, so it wasn't a total waste. Very easy to understand."
2,Too Much Money,I payed around $48.00 for this and it wasn't worth it! I could get ALL the patterns at the fabric store. Waist of money!
2,Their best release,"TYGERS OF PAN TANG was always a pedestrian British band from the beginning of the eighties, one of the dozens of bands that soon disappeared after the New Wave of British Heavy Metal began to lose momentum. (and, like dozens of others also, attempted a late comeback in the nineties).Anyway, at least their debut was fresh and energetic, and not compromised by sell outs. This freshness led the singer to be fired, and things were never the same again..."
3,"Worthwhile, but overly simplistic","As the title says, Last divides overeaters into five categories. Personally, I have found it beneficial to know what makes me want to munch. Also, the book is realistic as it discusses overeating -- not necessarily eating a quart of ice cream at one sitting -- but making poor food choices. Last adds in personal anecdotes both relating to her own experiences and those of former patients.The biggest drawback to the book for me were the remedies. After intriging me by discussing my ""reason,"" Last gives overly simplistic problem-solving advice. For example, she suggests deep breathing for an anxious eater. Yeah, right."
4,A real workhorse,The Ames True Temper Splitter seems to be well made and does its job well.The handle-guard is well designed and effective.
1,"Not Universal,Doesnt Fit","This lock doesnt fit as universal replacement.Its holes miss by about 1/2 inch which might as well be a complete miss in terms of its claim to be universal.So you must than go down and get yourself some metal drill bits align new holes perfectly than drill in and hope it all lines up well.Any slight miss in drilling and the upper lock will be under enormous srain and very well might not operate.Further if the holes are off by 1/2 on the outside and inside of door the plate holes as well will be off.Only these cant be drilled new screw holes will have to be created in your door.Easy enough only problem is your existing holes are very close to where the new holes have to be drilled which will create one super sized hole as the screw holes cave in on one another.Garbage product and certainly mot universal.Hit or miss.A waste of time,energy and money."
1,2 already broken,"I normally never fill out these reviews. but i bought this thing to replace an old one. I love the way it looks. installed fine and worked great for one month, then the latch broke. i figured it was a bad one so i bought the same exact one again, also lasted about one month. same exact thing happened. looks great but product quality is crap. no i have to buy a 3rd one."
5,Becoming More,"For years I stayed away from devotional / self-help type books. I could not relate to them and never felt satisfied. So I was leary of buying ""Becoming More Than A Good Bible Study Girl"" at first. However, within the first chapter I was brought to tears, laughed and knew that this book was meant for me. I have already done the study once and have plans to go through it again this fall. I have also told several dear friends about the book and they loved it as well."
5,Just What Every Woman Needs!,"In Becoming More Than a Good Bible Study Girl Lysa Terkeurst offers humorous stories, practical insights and biblical truth for Christian women of all ages. Although I am married, I don't yet have kids and I've found many books aimed at Christian women to be written with the assumption that everyone reading them is a mother. Lysa's book wasn't like that. Even the insights she draws from being a mother shed light on issues we all struggle with like pride, insecurity or anger. The thing I love most about Lysa and her book is that she's real. While I was reading I felt like I was sitting down for coffee with a friend. I've recommended this book to my mother, my young married friends, a few single friends and even a college student. If you are female and you are a Christian, buy this book. There is something in it for you!"
5,Destined to be a household name,"The content of this book is destined to be a household name amongst women who are seeking to grow in Christ. Honesty, transparency, meekness, and insightfulness are only the beginning description of Lysa's heartfelt work. Looking forward to leading a study in this!"
4,"Interesting, if you're into that sort of thing","I haven't actually finished the book, but I've liked what I've read so far. I'm just not much of a non-fiction reader, which is why I struggle to finish the book. It's not really told me anything new, but neither has it annoyed me, as non-fiction how-to-be-better books so often do.On the other hand, I'm not sure why it's got a ton of 5 star reviews either. The author's writing style is nice but a bit silly sometimes (silly as to the point of ugh or ick; the sort where if you were her kid you'd have hand to head and be saying ""Moooooooommmmm, you're so corny"" all whiny-like). I'll definitely finish the book, just not in a timely manner."
4,Great book!,Not much more to add then the other reviewers have said. This is a great book and Lysa's style is very easy.
3,"Okay, not great","After seeing the overwhelming number of five star reviews, I hesitate to give a less-than-fantastic review... but here goes.I wasn't impressed. I love to read and rarely skim through a book, but this book was a ""skimmer"" for me.If you're looking to grow in your spiritual life, I recommend ""Instroduction to the Devout Life"" by St. Francis de Sales or ""The Practice of the Presence of God,"" by Bro. Lawrence. These are spiritual classics that will help you grow in holiness."
4,Base not that heavy.,We found the metal base not heavy enough to hold steady. We need to put a brick on it. Perhaps our water pressure is higher than the other reviewers. The base is hollow. I may try to fill it in with water putty (it is like concrete). The sprinkler head works great. The metal distance deflector can be bent by hand but is stiff enough to work fine.
4,Something Different,"Finally, an 80's collection without all the ""standards"". I thought the inclusion of The Firm's ""Star Trekkin"" was great."
4,"Excellent informative book, great service","Almost like a textbook, I have learned even more about the life and work of Artimesia nd her father. I would have liked to see more color plates but black and white renderings are clear and informative."
3,"Liked, but didn't Love!","I am an advanced exerciser and I have a few Jari Love DVDS. This is not my favorite. There are several good exercises in this video, but WAY TOO much talking and explaining. I has to occupy my time doing bicep curls and crunches to keep my heart rate up while Jari and the narrator explained all of the exercises. Once we got started on the exercises, they were good, but I don't have enough time or patience to listen to all of the explanations. I will continue to do this workout, but I will be adding in exercises for all of the extended breaks."
1,not worth my money,if you love to workout and lift weights this video is not for you. i did the whole video an did not feel no kind of burn. that is why i was so glad to send it back. can some one tell me about a good workout video that is worth my money
4,kicks (your) butt,This is my favorite of the ripped DVD workouts. It's a serious workout that genuinely fatigues your muscles - I get a better workout when I do this than when I actually go to the gym! It also has higher production values and better music than some of the earlier ones like the original Get Ripped which is a little dated and cheesy.
5,Great workout DVD,"I wanted to find a DVD that would give me a good workout without having too many different pieces of equipment - all I use for this workout is a set of dumbbells. I have this and ""Get Ripped"" and I really enjoy the workouts. Jari's voice is soothing, which I like, and she is very supportive while she talks you through the workout. The people in the workout are all doing the exercises at different ability levels and you are told to modify the workout to your own abilities and comfort level. I especially like that she counts the reps out loud so you don't have to look at the TV to make sure you're keeping up! I used Cathe something-or-other's video and hated it and sold it. I'm keeping these!"
4,Good but not Great,"In reading ""The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas"", I found it to be a good overview of the revolution in the South where my ancestors fought. I would have found it to be much better for my needs in researching family history if the book had more maps and a much better index. I would have preferred more maps and fewer pictures of the combatants."
2,A disappointment overall.,"The author uses few primary sources and rehashes the familair story of the British in the South. He misses many details, and provides only scant material asto why the Crown ever started the campaign. The biographies of the leaders are good, as is his treatment of the Whig vs. Tory struggle in NC and SC. Overall, however, the author breaks no new ground and failed to use some obvious (and readily available) primary sources. Why no American accounts of the Seige of Charleston? Why no description of the Hessians?"
4,Quite good,"The book has three facets that highly recommend it. First, the author has a mature intelligent voice that comes through in his writing enabling him to depict events with empathy and depth. Secondly, the work is comprehensive, describing small partisan actions that otherwise get short shrift. Third, I enjoyed his choice of assessing the command skills of the various combatants. His reasoning is sounds and buoyed well by the facts as he, admittedly, presents them. I also found his prose style engaging.My only criticism is that he gives equal time to minor engagements and major battles. He also describes so many skirmishes that without maps or illustration they tend to dissolve into one another. Furthermore, it would have been nice if he had chosen to chronicle the remainder of the campaign. Of course, my desire for the book to be longer only demonstrates my appreciation of it.I recommend it."
5,the Road to Guilford Courthouse,"great southern history written like a novel easy to read should be required in high school. We are losing our heritage,by not teaching our history . Our children don't know what we have achieved in this country"
4,Good product ... when it finally arrived,"Bought this screen to use with my projector. The idea was to use it the first time on a family party so I paid rush delivery. The screen finally arrived, 3 days after the commited date. When I called customer care, they said they will return to my credit card the amount of the shipping, this never happened. Do not pay rush delivery for this product, I understand it's not the first time this happens."
3,Another typical Microsoft product,"It seemed that Microsoft Press needed to fill many pages before publishing this book. It does do what it says, include info on how to get people into a help desk and what can be expected. It trains and gives ideas to the managers and I especially liked their grid on staffing the help desk and all the things to take into consideration.Still, it lacked info, like what were the best ways to create a knowledge base for the help desk, it just kept mentioning that it was important and left it at that. And the websites as reference at the back of the book are not that hot. The CDs could be better also.So in other words, it is a typical Microsoft product, something with great potential that does not live up to expectations but is expected to sell wonderfully because it has the Microsoft logo over it."
1,Not worth the price,"For the price of the book I was expecting some great tips and wisdom on help desk and support. Instead, the book only offered surface level information. Almost the last half of the book is a Resource Directory - Most, if not all, of this information can be found in simple web searches. To add insult to injury, the CD does not offer any usable templates or checklists."
1,Buyer Beware,"The Greens+ bars I ordered were inedible. I don't know if they were stored improperly or they didn't survive the shipping, but the consistency and flavor were way off. They tasted nothing like the bars I had gotten in the store which I just love. By the way, there is a problem with the manufacturer and they are very hard to find due to unavailability so maybe they were just old."
1,Do not compare to the regular Greens+ bars,"These bars were a disappointment. I ate only two of the box and ended up giving the remainder away. Compared to the original Greens+ bars - both regular and chocolate - these bars fall short. They go down heavy and sit like a brick in your stomach. I found that they have an almost sour flavor and similarly unpleasant aftertaste. I also don't like that they have whey in them, whereas the other Greens+ bars are vegan. I can't recommend these. For extra protein, you would be better off with a handful of peanuts. I prefer the original Greens+ bars - much better flavor, simpler ingredients, and better product overall."
1,Not helpful,I think this is for someone who is further along in the healing process. I found this book to be more hurtful than helpful.
4,helpful exercises,"I found the author's suggestions helpful in recovering from my rape. Of course nothing can substitute for counseling, but the author did a good job of not being patronizing."
1,Annoyed,Just hate that I had to buy it and I hate that I have to write seventeen words about it. This new thing is stupid. Made me angry and led to a bad review.
5,Asprin's War books at their best,"I have read Asprin's amazing ""Myth"" and ""Thieves' World"" series, and compliment him greatly on these fine works. One day, I was reading a list of Asprin books and saw ""Cold Cash War"". Normally a fantasy lover, I expanded my horizions and decided to see if this science fiction/war novel was any good.Boy, was I suprised. Asprin amazes me with grim detail and cultural changes in his ""corporate world"", where the country is run by feuding businesses. With mercenaries and Japaneese samauri, these corporations battle the US government in the ultimate battle for business freedom. Not for every Asprin reader (especially not a lighthearted one), but an intriguing book for any techno or war fan. The only depressing thing about it is that Asprin never wrote a sequel."
4,Wish there was more,"This book is wonderful. The only drawback is there isn't more to it. The entire novel took me less than a day to read. The characters were well developed and believable. The plot, though far-fetched, within this framework was enjoyable."
2,Blah Christmas jazz compilation,"Generic Christmas jazz compilation by no-name artists, good for playing in the background when you are wanting to focus your attention on something else. No vocals, completely instrumental. None of the songs stood out as special. I liked the cover artwork more than the CD itself."
2,So-so,If you can get past the instructor's annoying voice and the cast's silly wardrobe...the workout is not as challenging as I would have expected.
5,GREAT,"I bought Boot Camp Firm it - loved Tracey's energy so much that I got this one ""Burn it"" as well. This work out is good - I certainly feel like I got my money's worth! WOW It is inspiring - you can do as much of the exercise as you like and Tracey gives you good guidance and pushes you along. I definately feel a difference after ONE work out!!!! This will have me looking 17 again in no time. If you are up for a good workout that pushes you this is the one to get! I'm hooked."
3,BOOT CAMP style toning and cardio,"This is set up like a boot camp from their camouflage outfits to the titles of the workout segments Basic training, drill, power, etc. It's a good idea that the segments have the times listed for those limited on time. Ms. Mallett emphasizes to have fun in your workouts, and in this workout she successfully expresses that."
3,"If you've done one Tracey Mallet workout, you've done them all","I agree with the other reviews in that you will get a good workout from this DVD, but I found it boring. I have used the Tracey Mallet Boot Camp from the Method Series (which I liked a lot), and this workout is very much like it. However, in this workout, I found that the camera angles were not so helpful at times, particularly if you are trying to find the modified version of a move. I highly recommend the Shape Boot Camp workouts, as they have better instruction and more innovative routines. This is just my opinion, so if you like Tracey Mallet, then by all means, give this one a try."
5,Very Intense but effective,"I'd been trying to loose the post pregnancy weight with very little results until I found Tracey's Method show on Fit TV. This prompted me to get the bootcamp dvd. The first week I lost 4 Lbs.If you haven't exercised in a while it's a very intense workout combining cardio, strength training ( you need a set of 5lbs weights) and kickboxing with basketball and football drills, but if you stay consistant and don't expect to do it all at once you will see fast results. The DVD is actually split up in sections depending on how much time you can give to the workout each day but that also helps with determining your pace. The bonus Ab workout is awesome I lost the post baby bulge in a month!"
1,Superbody workout is a super disappointment,"Tracey Mallett is a talented trainer. However, her style doesn't translate well onto dvd. She wears these big palazzo pants that are very distracting and makes it hard to see the proper movement. It is obvious to tell that her team is not in sync and they don't reallly know each other ... it affects your mood & how well you engage with the workout. I purchased this dvd looking for a high intensity, fat burning workout. I did not work up much of a sweat at all. I followed the high reviews for this dvd and was seriously disappointed. My favorites right now at home are Crunch Boot Camp and Women's Health Total Workout in Ten ... I would highly recommend those dvds. I used Tracey Mallett's workout about 2-3 times and now I've already sold it on ebay."
2,A Decent Introduction,"Based on the other reviews, I was expecting a lot from this book but was disappointed after finishing it. The book's collection of papers provides a good introduction to the general concepts found in other books, but I found that it lacks many of the specific implementation details and calculations that I have seen elsewhere."
5,21 Day Fast,The book was sent timely and very affordable met above expectations. An excellent study and guide to fasting and prayer.
5,"One of the BEST ""BELIEVER'S"" FASTING BOOKS!","I have other fasting books, because I love to fast because the various benefits, especially the ""Spiritual"" kind of benefits are so wonderful and fulfilling, but this book is one of ""my favorites"" on fasting, because it is so encouraging ""Scripturally"" with the fasting. If you are a Christian and you need some encouragement to complete your fast, then this will help and inspire you."
3,Wow! Really?,"Mini Disks were very popular before CD-RWs became the rage, then they kind of faded into oblivion. Of course I jumped all in on this ""ground breaking"" technology. I am the proud owner of 4 of these devices among them the Sony MZ-N707 and the Sony MZ-RH1. I even had a disk changer for my car. The MZ-RH1 was one of the first (maybe THE first) to come with a USB interface allowing file transfers to and from the computer. Of course Sony's DRM restrictions prevented many files from being transferred once burned onto disks. It's hard to believe that these things are appreciating in value especially with the growth of IPODs and thumb drives. I have to admit I still break my old MDs out from time to time but come on people. Even my grand mother owns an IPOD now."
5,Geat sound. Beautiful design.,"I read all the reviews and, since Sony has stopped production, decided to buy this expensive toy before it disappears from the market. The sound is excellent (I listen to classical music and opera,) even if the player is connected to AA battery-powered, cheap Sony speakers (SRS-T55). The Sony MZ-RH1 is small, easy to operate, and very elegant looking. I agree, Sonic Stage software is hard to use; however, I have figured out ways of working around some of the problems other people have mentioned in their reviews. I'll be glad to share this information in another forum.I have owned two older Sony Net MD and HiMD walkmans, both still work. The oldest one, bought five years ago, had an input jack and I was able to record my classical music tapes on minidiscs. Unfortunately I gave it away. Now I'll be able to transfer the rest of my old tapes to minidiscs."
2,"Great for transfers, not so great for editing and recording","As other reviewers have noted, this unit at long last allows for the ability to transfer any minidisc to the computer. I really have to ask, though, why should we be so impressed and amazed by that? That feature should have been available all along.I have used many older MD, Net-MD, and Hi-MD recorders. This unit lacks the great ""track wheel"" of older models and has only a one-line display, so editing and moving between tracks and into folders is much more difficult than older bigger-display models. It also seem to have no option for an external battery pack.For recording, it works fine, although the T-mark button is poorly made and difficult to depress cleanly.In conclusion, I would recommend the older Hi-MD models, which also allow for transfer of at least Hi-MD recordings to the computer, over this newer model. The only benefit to this model is if you have lots of old minidiscs you need to pull onto the computer."
1,"Maybe I was wrong, the pundits are right, this device is basically perfect","I bought this hoping to speed upload of music (and also comedy) that I have on various media (cassette, reel-to-reel, LP) and painstakingly recorded onto standard minidisc using a minidisc deck (JE630).The range of features is very impressive. I particularly liked the ability to choose bit rate for conversion when transferring via sonic stage to Hi-MD. This enabled me to store 42 1/2 hour radio comedy programs (Goon Shows) on a single MD.I had some problems which I reported previously, and which report I now unreservedly withdraw. Something isn't 100% right for me but most probably it's not the MZ-RH1. (No - I wasn't contacted by anyone at Sony, this is merely in the interests of public transparency and honesty).I would caution all users to make sure that they check the sound quality of what is being uploaded and saved.Too bad, I can't give it 5 stars any more, the software wouldn't let me alter that for the review."
3,THIS IS NOT TO BAD,THIS C.D. IS VERY GOOD I RECOMEND YOU BUY IT IF YOU ONLY DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY
4,Fripp Meets Zappa (In The End),"I listened to a few tracks on the internet and was blown away!!So the best thing to do was to order it straight away.Please buy this EP,it's great.Don't download it if you want to keep this great music alive!!I Rated it 4 stars because the new 2003 album will be 5!!"
4,The King is alive .,"Well , the King is alive and well , this is definitive for open minded crimson fans , and those of you looking for innovation , however , if you miss the old days of the King , there is a band that I can truly recommend , simply unique and it may be the only one that I dare to compare with the big leagues bands, they blends the past , present and future of (the badly used label) ""progressive rock "" , but I can not change that , they are called ""Tempano "" and the release I refer to is ""The agony and the ecstasy"" , for me the revelation of 2002 , check it out , you do not have any idea of what you are missing here , you are about to get hooked , what a discovery for me."
1,Bliss,How wonderful it must be to be a psuedooriginal band surrounded by a majoritycloth eared public.
5,A DEMOCRACTIC KING,"There's a little of everything here: head banging, blues, metal, and poetry represent a wide variety of styles that would simply leave less talented bands adrift far, far out at sea. Crimson pulls it off brilliantly. This eclectic mix is stitched together by short vocal and instrumental vignettes that add a dose of continuity and coherence without intruding on the whole experience. This allows each episode to stand apart without ever falling apart.The jewel in the crown this time out is the latest installment in the ""Lark's Tongues' "" canon. Unlike so many imitators, Crimson is able to cut loose and stay together all at once. The compositional complexity is finally matched to a wild sense of freedom: nothing constrained, precious or small-minded about what's happening here. An incredible fury pointed right between your ears. No doubt -- hear this and you'll have the power to believe."
3,A step in the right direction,"After an album that was the worst that the band has ever done. This finds the band headed back in the right direction. While there are a couple of weak spots like the title track this finds the band rebounding quite nicely. Eyes Wide Open is a wonderful song and maybe the best on here. This ""acoustic version"" makes me wish that the band tried this sort of thing more often. Many of the other tracks on here are quite nice also. Several of the songs here would be on the band's next album The Power To Believe and I think a couple turn out better here. If you find a good deal on this I would recommend buying it."
2,Disappointing,"In one word: disappointing. I don't know why they bothered to release this CD. While the title track is pretty cool, the rest of the tracks are rather pointless throwaways. Belew goes overboard with rather trite-sounding angelic vocal effects. Eyes Open Wide is an interesting tune, but why Larks Tongues Part 4 yet again? I bought this at the same time as Heavy ConstruKction, and HC is great, while this disc blows. I hope this EP is not representative of the new upcoming KC release. Looks like KC hit their peak and are on the downhill side. Bummer since I have been a huge fan since the Bruford/Wetton days."
4,"Time to fly, went big time !!","This band is from WASHINGTON STATE, they are one of the best local bands around, this band is simply amazing, ive heard a couple tracks from this album already and WOW, this cd fits in with my collection with thrice,prevent falls, blah blah and all my other fav bands, i havnt followed this band that long, but i heard them on the local station KGRG up here in auburn,WA. EVERYONE if your a thrice fan pick this cd up and go to there mp3.com site and preview some tracks, also if you search on mp3.com go to the rocketstar records mp3 page and you can find 2 more tracks from their new album, check these guys out !! and get theyre older cd from their site, later>> drew"
5,Amazing Album,"I knew these guys when I was in High School. I will still sit down and listen to this album a multitude of times a year. They stay there because if you listen to the album, no one song is unrelated to another. They run in triads, duos, and ridiculously awesome sets. It sounds like it is a concert constantly building and crumbling under it's own weight but then lifting itself up each time it is reborn to a new, and higher height.A truly excellent album from the NorthWest."
3,meh,"this band changed their name from 'time to fly', which they rightfully hated, to 'creatures from africa'.click here to get some new songs from them.new stuff > this cd."
1,This isnt even listenable,"I think The Ataris are better than this band. And I hate the Ataris, a lot. Theres probably 50,000 local pop punk bands across the country that sound exactly like this band. The vocals are really horrible. the guitar's bland and repetitive, and the drums are a carbon copy of every other pop punk band. Unoriginality isnt the way to win people over, nice job guys."
2,Not representative of the others,"This was the first Travis McGee book I read -- it's recommended as one of the best 100 mysteries by Keating -- and it really turned me off. McGee comes across as bloodthirsty and hyperviolent; not at all the sympathetic character he is in the other books. Luckily I read another McGee book and found out that The Green Ripper is not representative of the series. If, like me, you pick this book up because of Keating's recommendation, all I can say is I haven't a clue why Keating selected this as one as the best. He also choose The Blue Hammer as one of Ross Macdonald's best, when it was definitely his worst."
4,McGee teaches terrorists a lesson,"Wow - where do I start? This is about the 10th McGee book I've read, and like the others, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Like so many others, it starts out with our hero's newest girlfriend, who you know will not live to the end of the story. Travis must avenge her wrongful death, which leads him to the strangest adventure he's ever had. Mysterious government agents enlist his help (who are those guys?). He stumbles into Camp Weirdo, a cross between Jonestown and Usama Bin-Laden's training center, where he isn't supposed to escape. Since the camp's residents are little more than automatons, I had little sympathy for what Travis had to do. You know Travis will be resourceful, since he has several more colorful adventures ahead. I would have given this the full 5 stars, except there were too many loose ends left unanswered. I almost thought (though I know better) that MacDonald left them on purpose to support a future McGee story."
3,Trav does Rambo,"Readers of John McD's previous novel in the Travis McGee series (Empty Copper Sea) will note that our hero is becoming aware that he is stuck in the sixties and may never grow up. In The Green Ripper we see a dark side of Travis that somehow seems misplaced. While Travis has committed the occasional murder in self-defense (Darker than Amber), he is transformed into John Rambo as he murders 10 or 11 religious cult terrorists while fighting for his own life. The Epilogue finds Trav committing adultery with a 40-ish moneyed wife,who is a totally new character. For my money, I prefer the lazy, real estate savvy, beach bunny/ Busted Flush Trav. This guy borders on being a jerk. But maybe that's just part of growing up."
4,Book review &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; THE GREEN RIPPER by John D. MacDonald,"This is the darkest of all the Travis McGee novels. Trav infiltrates a group of terrorists on a mission of revenge. My favorite parts are where Travis does a Rambo; kicks ass, takes names and anyone who manages (excuse me, *womanages*, see DAUGHTER MOON) to survive gets tied-up & turned into the Feds.I don't quite buy the build-up, with McGee mooning over lost love, but John D. is the consummate professional, the top notch craftsman; even if the spark of early John D. MacDonald genius is missing, the story still holds me. I've read it at least twice, three is my guess. @hg47"
3,I have the same problem.....,"with this book as other reviewers. As a story without the McGee character I'd go four stars easy. But to me it just isn't a McGee. I read all the McGee books as they came out from '64 on and I thought this book marked the end of the character as I knew it. I thought maybe MacDonald was purposely writing the book this way to signal us fans that McGee had been ""modernized"".That wasn't the case but there the book stands all by itself! I've re-read the series a few times and always dread this one. Again, it's not a bad book, to me and others obviously, but it's not a McGee."
5,Perfect paperback thriller; easy to read & exciting,"Although not written with the best grammar and has one cliche too many, it sure keeps you turning pages; intelligently plotted; builds suspense; A-plus in its genre..... Kept me up till 2 and 3 in the morning!"
5,love it!,"this was my first flatscreen/hdtv...its been really reliable, great tv, i dont understand all the other reviews about it not supporting alot of their other devices....i have hooked up alot of things to it n it all worked perfectly, it has such a clear picture...the only downside which i wish i had been better informed of when i bought it is that it does not have an atsc(digital) tuner, it only has an analog tuner...but other than that its a great tv"
1,Would have been a nice product 50 years ago,"This product is nothing more than an expensive computer monitor. It does NOT recieve digital or HDTV channels. That simple. I purchased an expensive HDTV antenna to capture the ""hidden"" channels. Forget it. It only picks up the ancient analog channels. I could do that with my 20 year-old tube TV. The HDTV logo on the front is misleading....no, it's an outright lie. If I could give this zero stars, I would."
1,Poor quality,"So I don't write many reviews, frankly I get sick of reading reviews that say, ""I bought this yesterday and I just love it!"" Of course you just bought it. Now if you loved it and it lasted for 20 years than that is a good product.This TV lasted me 2.5 years. It is a poor product. Today it went out, the image is blurry and the video doesn't work. I don't think a new TV should need to be purchased every three years. So you may love this while you own it, but you won't own it very long."
3,Audio,"I bought this tv and was very disappointed that it cannot be connected to a home theater setup. It has NO output jacks to connect it to an external sound system. I called Samsung about this, and was told there are output jack on the larger sets, but not on this one. Why not just put jacks on the smaller sets also."
1,Dissapointed,I recently ordered and returned this item because I was disappointed with the picture quality of this LCD. When watching the LCD I noticed it was slow to respond when there was any type of movement. It was most noticeable to me in the faces of the characters on the screen. I would not recommend this product to anyone that is planning on watching it for movies or television.
2,Good and Bad,"There is problem with this TV and I had to return. The price is lowest of somewhat 30-40% of in-store and free delivery. service of Amazom is excellent, fast, free and professional. I will stay with Amazon as long as they have the one I want."
5,Incredible If Set Up Properly,"I'm not going to lie, I got the not supported message myself. But after I set up my PS3 properly, everything was great. I use component cables and leave the resolution on 1080i. It plays DVDs and games with a wonderful picture with no problems. I use an HDMI cable to hook my HD STB and that looks great also. The picture is great at all resolutions except when hooked up to analog cable, then there is a lot fuzz. My only real gripe is that there is NO audio out. I think that is something that all TV's should have. Other than that, I am very pleased with this product and I don't think that there are any other comparable products with these features at this price range."
3,Good picture - needs better features,I use analog cable only with this unit in a bedroom location.Pros: Picture is very good given the analog signal source. Plenty of audio for our bedroom setting. Unit looks good.Cons: The remote must be pointed within a very narrow angle range towards the receiver for it to pick up the remotes signal. The onscreen channel numbers are very small and hard to read at a distance. I have found no way to increase font size. Long delay in unit turn on with remote make you keep pushing the power button and hoping you have it pointed at the proper angle. Would rate it at between 3 and 4 out of 5.
5,Excellent Value,"This LCD TV displays brilliant color when watching HD TV. It does not have the pip function for TV as advertised. It does not have audio out. You can defeat that by hooking up your cable box to your Home Theater System. I also would recommend using a HDMI cable to connect the TV to your cable box, it provides a superior picture than using the component cables (less image artifacts). I have an XBOX 360 connected and the games are beautiful. There is a problem watching XBOX 360 dvd on the LCD but I use the xbox for gaming. If using a Home theater system with a DVD make sure you buy Widescreen format DVD's and configure your DVD player accordingly"
1,Full of deception.,There is NO hypnosis and NO sex demonstration on this DVD.Picture on the cover is absolutely deceiving!Made very unprofessionally with static camera.In the form of lecture with no public listening.Very boring.Total waste of money!
4,Communism is not that scary,I liked this book. It made me think that people aren't scared of Communism but of what happened in Russia. In Russia it wasn't real communism because everyone wasn't equal. I had to read this in 10th grade History and I understood it. I think that the ideals of communism are very neat. Everyone is equal isn't that what America was going for?
4,this book is power and love,i am not cmmunist. but i love marx. this boot is my love'sstart. marx's book is always being (in capitalism)
4,Best so far,"This is the best instructional video I have for belly dance. I have two others. there is some stuff that I did not find relevant,but Jehan is a very good dancer and the instructions are very clear. It was also nice to have instruction on head movement, finger cymbals and using a veil."
3,Not a good dvd for a beginner,I have been dancing for awhile. I also own and work with a few BD DVDs. I got this one after reading reviews here. I was shocked at what I have seen on this dvd. Posture is wrong and with no real explantion. There is no intruction except for a brief like drop hip. Jehan might be a good dancer but this is not a good dvd for learning belly dance. There is no real breakdown of movements. Those just learning belly dance would be much better getting a another dvd. Look to Habiba or Keti for great learning dvds.
3,slow-moving and somewhat dated,"I am surprised by the unanimously glowing reviews. I wonder if the reviewers of this video are a self-selecting group of women of a certain age (my age, probably) with a strong affinity for traditional Middle Eastern costuming and heavy make-up--some of whom remember the bellydance craze of the 70s. The way she discusses the flow of energy in different movements is useful, and she includes a wide array of movements, but I found the DVDs slow-moving and somewhat dated. There have been many better ones since, including Blanca's Sensual Bellydance. The encyclopedia format would be useful for a beginner (it is labeled ""Level 1""), but most more advanced dancers would find it too rudimentary. Everyone has a unique style and while I'm clearly in the minority here, I just don't respond to this--I find it hard to watch. If you favor a more dynamic and sinuous style (or, obviously, anything in the tribal/fusion universe), this might not be for you."
2,Not enough Sydney,"I purchased this calendar because I love the show, and because I wanted some more images of Jennifer Garner. Unfortunately, she is only on two of the twelve months. I realize that perhaps many of you out there would rather have all of the other cast memebers featured, and if that's the case, this is the wall calendar for you. But, if you were hoping for lots of shots of Sydney, I recommend you keep looking. Also, for those of you who like to write-in various upcoming events on your calendar, the available space is very often taken up by lists of various holidays on that day."
1,really,"If you want a laugh - this is not it. Serious messages is not provided in a realistics concept of story telling. You know it, but sometimes need others to say it! All of the actors are on crack like Mr. Brown."
4,"Needed it for class, used it beyond","Priciest book I ever needed to buy, but it was well worth it. I split it with my project group, and I recommend you do the same."
1,Missing most of the last chapter in Kindle edition,"I've previously read this book in a print edition and would rate it with five stars. It is actually my favorite little booklet on this topic. The best part of the book is chart in the final chapter where Boettner contrasts the Five Points of Calvinism with Arminianism. However, that incredibly-helpful chart is entirely missing in the Kindle edition! I was so sad to see the best part of the book left out without any explanation at all. If you didn't know it was missing, you might just think that the last chapter ended rather abruptly.Until this missing material is placed in the Kindle edition, I strongly recommend going for the print edition."
5,Fingerprint Reader,Gifted Touch is about a girl named Rae Voight who starts hearing voices in her head. Her first impulse is that she's going crazy like her mother. Then Rae starts going to group therapy but all she wants to do is be a normal girl and go to school and parties. On her way to group therapy a bomb explodes in the girls bathroom that she is in and hears a voice in her head that sounds like she wants to kill Rae for something and wants to frame Anthony for it. Anthony is this boy in Rae's group therapy who is a slow reader and who helps Rae realize that she is gifted. Whenever she touches a fingerprint she can read your thoughts at the time you left the mark. Now Rae has to help prove that Anthony is innocent and find whoever wants her dead. This was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.
5,I'd give it 100 stars if it was an option!,"This series is an awesome spine tingling suspensful ride. Even my sister, who absolutely hates reading, loves these books and fights with me to read it first. Let me spare myself having to write two more reviews also- the next two are just as good and me and my sister are waiting impatiently for the fourth. My only complaint is when are Rae and Anthony gonna fiannly hook up? Their dragging it on like a soap opera but it also adds some drama to the mysteriousness so all in all it's a win-win situation if u read this book because you'll just as soon want to read the next. So go buy it and enjoy"
4,Interesting Concept,"Imagine being able to read the thoughts of others just by touching their fingerprints. Awesome, but freaky right? This series is about a girl named Rae with just that ability. This book documents the day she discovers her ability and how her lie changes afterwards. First of all, everyone back at her school thinks she's a nutcase. SEcond, she's being forced to go to group therapy (where she meets Anthony and Jesse who help her understand her gift). Third... someones out to kill her!Great storyline, a little slow and frustrating for the reader who understands Rae's ability even though Rae, the narrator, does not. And I must warn you, although the early books in the series hint a relationship between Rae and Anthony, it won't develop until later on in the series... so stick with it. (thats the only reason I rated the book 4 stars)Happy Reading!"
3,Murder on the orient express,This game was okay. It was not better than and then there were none. It keep getting stuck in some parts of the game and the women who was do the investing on the train keep move slow at some point of the game. It seems like it was glitches through the game.
5,Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express Review,The special effects are great. The game play is fun and keeps you thinking that you don't want to stop playing. It can get a little hard at times but that's what I liked about the game. It keeps you guessing. Agatha Christies' book also comes with the game. I loved that and read it in a day.
2,Not a thirty dollar game,"The PC game Murder on the Orient Express boasts beautiful graphics, a plot line provided by one of mystery's great authors, and rich narration. Yet these cannot make up for the fact that this is an incredibly boring game. The game is full of mundane tasks (retrieving this or that for someone) that require no real thinking. As another reviewer mentioned, the sequence in the game is off. The order of items and clues is incorrect, further adding to the ease of the game. As far as difficulty, it could be much improved. Game play was only about one week, playing an hour or two a day. While the game is entertaining on some level it is just priced much too high."
2,Very Disappointing,"My wife and I are fans of adventure games, but MOTOE (and it's previously released sibling, ATTWN) are sorry excuses for the genre. Much of the game play is tedious, and the puzzles are illogical (although slightly less so than ATTWN). After giving this 2nd part of The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series a chance, I don't expect we'll be wasting money or time on any future installments."
4,"A fun game to play, requires a lot of thought","The game comes with the actual book, so you could either read along with the game, or do one or the other first. The game does require a lot of thinking, and a lot of working with what isn't obvious. It'll help you out a little bit if you have a random ability to make something out of nothing."
3,"OK, but not great","I am used to playing Nancy Drew mystery computer games, and this is no comparison. If you want an enjoyable, sensible game, try those. This one left me stuck in a lot of parts, not even hinting to what I should do next. To sum it all up, I think it was a tad on the boring side. If you still want to purchase the game, wait until it goes on sale because it is not worth $30. Period."
3,"Talk, talk, talk","This game has beautiful music and pretty good animation. However, it is a game based on way too much talking and not enough action and puzzle solving. Took too long to load between sections and the puzzles were either super easy or completely out of left field. Had potential, but due to the lack of gameplay, I was pretty disappointed."
1,dislike the game,"I played the game three times and I cannot finish it because there is a glitch. At the end when I should get 3 endings, I get nothing and I cannot continue. I have not missed anything since I use a walkthru but when I check the journal there is one item not crossed out, but it was completed. I will never buy a game from the adventure company again!"
4,Refresher course,I knew most of the practices in this book but it was a good back to basics book it will stay in my reference library as with all singer books great quality I did learn a couple of new shortcuts
4,Upholstery Basics,"Great pictures, good over view of the subject. Arrived on time and in the stated condition. No complaints."
5,This book is tops,"I was looking for a book that would show me how to re-upholster antique French Provincial furniture. This book shows you how. It is so well illustrated, that I wouldn't hesitate to tackle the job myself. Complete instruction on how to install padding, liners or fabric, stapling the edge, then trimming the overage, then installing the braiding with brass tacks. To look at the outside, I always thought it was attached with the tacks, when in reality, the material is attached first underneath with staples. That creates an even overall attachment. Then you can concentrate on adding the brass tacks to the brading-cover evenly.That is just one example of the step by step instructions-something unusual in most books. A picture says a thousand words, so it is well illustrated with photographs.It is easy to be disappointed in how to books, this is not one of them. I don't have anything negative to say about this book at all. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
2,"Quick and concise, but incomplete","A book is good or bad depending on your expectations. This book concentrates mostly on how to do the covers of the sofas and seats, but it is incomplete in providing information about frames, springs and so on. Modern upholstery techniques are barely covered. I'm sorry to disagree with the rest of the reviewers, but I think that you need to know the other side of this book."
4,The basics,"As advertised, this text is basic. Probably the best book I've seen on the basics of furniture upholstery."
4,Shazam is so fine,I listened to the CD. He can sing and I just love the way that he makes me feel. I like the old school song 'Knockin' Da Boots' and among other...
2,Mediocre,This strategy guide is informative of what items you will acquire during the game. They do let you know when an inside scoop is coming up on the particular level you are on. That's as far as i can go though. Alot of info is left vague as far as step by step dungeon walk thrus which I think is why you want a strategy guide in the first place. So you don't miss key items in the game.
5,Excellent practise book in data quality,"David has written an excellent data quality book. He focuses on a real works around data quality. He presents a practical approaches how to solve a different types of quality defects and also pointed out main quality principles. But reader must think how to apply mentioned principles and approaches in reader's organization.Simply, good reading with application on a real cases."
1,Misleading,"This book is NOT about enterprise management, it's about SQL. If I had wanted a book on SQL, I would have bought a book about SQL. I wanted a book on Enterprise Knowledge Management. This is not it."
3,"YOU GET ONE PAIR, NOT THREE","In the review from June 2008, the customer states that she received 3 pairs for the price. Now, in 2011, it's one pair for the price. I haven't decided whether to keep them or not because of this; so, I haven't taken them out of the package. I have used Hanes silk reflections in years past and they were good. However, to me, over $10. is expensive for one pair."
4,Hanes Silk Pantyhose,Love the pantyhose. Wore them on New Years Eve and my legs looked great. I only splurge on good nylons for special occasions. These are great for those occasions.
5,Excellent Lamp,I purchased this lamp because it reminded me of Pixar. It has a beautiful finish and very easy to move where I need it and stays in place. I also have a higher wattage than recommended CFL bulb placed in it. It doesn't get to hot and it is so bright we can leave it on in the living room for my daughter to use as a nightlight.
2,Not that great a lamp,"Brightness is awkward, the lamp really does not have as many positions as you would think. I don't recommend this lamp for studying, and why else would anyone need a lamp?"
1,Wish there was a better designed closer,"This closer is a disappointment. The door is Very hard to open when it's installed. My wife couldn't even open the door so I had to ""chuck it"". I bought two so the other now sits on a shelf."
3,One of many,"One more textbook on econometrics on time series modeling. A good reference, but not all encompassing for most research projects."
2,You can get better,I have this book on econometrics together with other books. The others are far more understandable because more graphs and clearer formulas' explanations are given.
3,The Wayward Heart,"The Wayward Heart had all the elements needed for a good time travel romance. Unfortunately, the author went all over the place trying to add depth to too many characters and ended up stretching too thin on the main characters. The plot traveled along OK but wasn't developed as much as I think it could have been. More development of plot and less description would have helped. The ending was weak also, not resolving loose ends like does the main male lead ever believe the main female lead has come from the past, etc. Very unsatisfying, left me dangling. I hope she trys again though, definite potential if she keeps at it."
3,Fencing for Fun,"I ordered this for my husband and son, something they could do together. It's very informative...I've read other reviews that said the information isn't the most current, but since my husband and son aren't using the video to become ""professionals"", it's a lot of fun to do. The video quality is acceptable, my son says the music sounds like it was taken from the 80's, but it doesn't bother him..They enjoy learning the fencing moves; it's actually a good workout!"
2,"Amateurish, but not bad instruction","The instructor and his instruction in this video seem to be good, but the quality of the video is lacking. There is only one video angle used during the entire video, which makes it difficult at times to distinguish the details of his instructions. Other times the camera isn't focusing on the technique the instructor is describing.All in all a very amateurish video. While some of it might be a decent review for a novice fencer, everything in this video will have been taught in the first couple of fencing lessons. This video will not teach you how to fence. At most it will introduce you to some of the skills and terms, but without real training will not be much help."
1,Content was about sign language,"I bought this for my father. Unfortunately, the content of the DVD was about sign language but NOT fencing. He was very disappointed."
2,scrap,This is my 2nd screw gun and i couldn't be more irritated! I have used it twice and the gear switch drops out of gear in the middle of the screw process. great tool for making double work!
2,Fair item,I usually like Dewalt tools but I don't know if it was Amazon's fault or if it was poor quality from Dewalt. The switch for the speed control will not stay in the number 1 or number 2 position. I think Amazon sent me a tool that had been used and returned.
5,Harrowing,"Looking through some old books in my Attic, I happened upon this novel; first released back in 1995.It chronicles the down-ward spiral of a young Man with hopes an dreams, into a never ending slide towards his worse nightmare, a walking, Zombie. This is a harrowing depressing read, which I've often thought would make a great movie. It written in a very matter of fact way (Mr. Snell is an actor by profession, and it tells) but once you get used to his style, the novel opens up to you. Harrowing."
4,Life Changing???,This was a good book. Change your life good? Not mines. It's about a crackhead and you see things how he see and feel thing. You really have to get use to the writing style because some may call it artistic but for me it was mumble jumble. As you get into the book it become more coherent. It's always amazing the roads people choose to walk and what can be at the end of it. After wading through the mind of someone so grimy you actually look at your self and realize that could easily be you. As in life not all things are what they appear and this book is a prime example. This book also spoke a lot of truth concerning black people and why they not as together as they should.
2,Okay for Padalecki fans,"This is another film that didn't need to be made, which adds nothing to the franchise and has the usual predictable ending. There's also the usual collection of young sex maniacs and jerks who are just asking to be knocked off. There's not even a motive given for Jason to be attacking people. Nothing new here.The only good thing is the presence of Jared Padalecki, known to TV viewers as one of the charismatic stars of the series Supernatural. He is immediately sympathetic as a man who is searching for his missing sister and who is up against not only Jason but also a skeptical cop and an obnoxious, wealthy young fellow."
2,All Sorts of Awful,"A group of teens go camping in the woods. They smoke pot, drink beer, have sex, and end up dead. Then another group of teens go partying in their rich friend's house on the lake. They smoke pot, drink beer, have sex, and end up dead. I think at this point, if you're watching any Friday the 13th movie, you're watching it for either the boobs or the gore, not the plot. Or at least, that's what the writers were counting on, 'cause there are a whole lotta boobs and a whole lotta gore, but no plot at all. ""Who's Jason?"" my mother asked when it was over, that's how thin the mythology was in this one.If you're a die-hard B-movie buff, you'll get a few kicks out of this remake, but if you're a purist--or new to the genre--do yourself a favor and stick with the original."
2,"MORE OF THE SAME, NOTHING NEW","Here is a remake or a new rendition of the Friday the 13th movie. Seriously, there is nothing new here. Basically in a nutshell Jason kills and kills and kills and then comes back to life, big surprise. This movie offers no new insight about Jason or where he comes from. There is also no real suspense, just the run of the mill killings and gore. If you liked the other Friday the 13th movies, then you will probably like this one. But this is just another example of a Hollywood that runs out of ideas, so they rehash mediocre ideas to fill the gap. This is not as bad as the Halloween remakes, but nothing good either."
1,Friday The 13th 2009 Is A Disgrace,"This movie is the worst of the franchise.I was very disappointed. The scenes are too rushed, no cool kills, bad lighting, most of the actors (not all) are too boring, wheres the classic score?... and NO SUSPENSE."
3,I'll Give Credit Where It Is Due - But That's All,"The filmmakers were true to the look and feel of the original series but not ALL of the characteristics of Jason. Jason kidnaps Whitney because she bears some resemblance to his Mother. I had a real problem with that. Since when did Jason Voorhees ever, ever take anyone prisoner? That just didn't work for me. Derek Mears is great as Jason, props to the man, he did a fantastic job! But the story unraveled when it was discovered Jason had taken this young woman prisoner. Uncharacteristic behavior from the man in the hockey mask is the reason for my negativity towards this film.If they do another film (which I don't think they will) I would get another director and a storyline more in-line with the characteristics of its star character."
4,just get it,"this movie kicks the ass of the nightmare remake, I actually liked it, it tried to be it's own thing. Derek Mears is a good Jason, I like the scene with that Bree girl dancing haha so awesome"
1,Did not enjoy.,"There was nothing I enjoyed about this movie. It was everything I expected it to be, in the worst possible way. Some people might like it, but I really didn't, sorry to say."
1,Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1? Boooo!,This movie was shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Why are they releasing this cropped 1.77:1 version. They are cutting off the sides of the picture. I'd recommend getting THIS version instead:Friday the 13th (Extended Killer Cut and Theatrical Cut) [Blu-ray]
2,A Huge Letdown,"They had such potential with this remake. I find nothing original or memorable here. If you like pot and gruesome death scenes then you will enjoy this. If you are looking to be scared, this will let you down. There are no real jumps or scares."
4,Great Friday film.,"This film went right back to the classic and best Friday The 13th formula. Sex, gore, suspence, thrills, kills and Jason. The ending with the wood chipper could have been better, but before the credits the film and Jason make up for it. The lighting could have been a little better but again the darkness adds to the the realism of running threw backwoods at night while being persued by a psycho killer. Great film, Markus Nispel needs to keep directing these awesome redux films. TCM, TCM: Beginning, and now Friday The 13th are once again classics."
3,Pretty good for someone new to the series,"I'm going to preface this review with the note that I never saw the original Friday the 13th in its entirety. I did try a few years ago, but couldn't get through it.That said, I was pleasantly surprised. It kept me entertained. The dialogue is amusing and you'll find plenty of gore and boobs. Speaking of boobs, Julianna Guill (Bree in the movie) is simply amazing naked. That won't get me to like a movie by itself, but it sure doesn't hurt my overall opinion.If you have some time to kill and are in the mood for something you don't have to take too seriously, I'd recommend giving this a watch. It probably helped that I had very low expectations, but I also don't think it fully deserves the horrible rating it has on Rotten. There were several funny sequences and the suspense was reasonably well done."
2,"Ok, but not as good as the old ones.","This movie wasn't terrible as far as horrors go.. it had blood, boobs and Jason slashing up the campers, but I don't know. Just seemed like overall something was missing. It did not have the rewatchability of the old films in the series. I guess its better than Jason X and Jason Takes Manhattan, but didn't have the seriousness and scares of the early films like the Final Chapter. Fans of the serious should give it a view, but it doesn't have much to offer others. Check out the earlier ones, you will find they have more to offer."
4,Good remake,"While not a new thing, this latest remake is my first time watching the movie so I found it excellent and thrilling. Sure, some of it may have been a bit campy but I still found it enjoying to watch and thought that Jared Padalecki did a good job in this movie."
5,Updated slasher with guts!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie got a lot of negative reviews, but it's not all that bad of a movie. Friday the 13th remake is 1 thru 4 in one movie. Jason's mom gets killed like in the first movie, and for awhile Jason wears a sack over his head like pt. 2. Then he finds the hockey mask like pt. 3, and finally missing person search like pt. 4. The death scenes are very graphic compare to any in the series, and the nudity is way explore in the film as well. A bunch of teens going for a weekend getaway just to get slice and dice one by one just after a first set of teens got killed. But the one girl who looks like Jason's mother is held hostage, and this is where the search comes in. Friday the 13th remake is done more in a serious way then the last few movies in the series, and a movies that has a dude lusting over a Hustler magazine is a movie must own!"
3,Decent for a remake.,"It's not a total waste in the same fashion as the remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street,but it fails to add anything creative in the likes of what Rob Zombie accomplished with his reinterperations of Halloween . It's an alright film,but if you want to find better Jason stories the Friday the 13th comic books offer more story than Michale Bays big budget remake."
1,X-RATED VERSION OF FRIDAY THE 13TH?,"I have never been a fan of the Friday the 13th movies but this one was so bad I just had to write a review to warn others. I feel like the people behind the movie had to show as much nudity they could to keep the viewer's attention and by doing so they made it more like a cheap porn movie than a horror flick. Apparently since ""sex"" seems like the theme of the movie, the spotlight was never on Jason, or even if it was, he didn't have much of it. I'm very disappointed by this movie, I am glad I didn't have to pay to see it, because if I did you can be sure I would have waited in line with all the other people who paid to get my refund."
4,Now make with the murderin'!,"Correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that the only reasons anyone would watch a Friday the 13th movie are 1.) blood and 2.) boobs. This movie delivers both. And how! First, the blood. The murders in this movie are, more often than not, spectacular. The sleeping bag kill and the surprise bow and arrow kill, especially, are magnificent. Next, we have the boobs. Six of them, if memory serves. the first two are kinda weird looking. The next two are nice. The last two are unreal. UN. REAL. The rest of the movie is standard fare- obligatory pot references for street cred, cookie cutter characters and cringe-worthy dialogue. Jason's tunnels and frontier-style early warning systems were a nice touch, though. I dug it and plan to buy it when I can find it for $14.99 or below."
2,Friday the 13th,Good ideaBad movie from beginning to end lame !They should of stop after Jason x !!!!
2,Run Jason Run..,"Friday the 13th the remake combines the original two movies into one. It starts with Jason's mom getting killed and then we see Jason begin his rampage, first with a bag over his head and then a hockey mask. Very exciting stuff. Jason has also figured out how to sprint in this movie. Apparently he realized that his slow lumbering walk just wasn't closing the deal..He also was able to add some trip wires at strategic locations throughout the woods so he could be alerted to the presence of campers. Apparently this would allow him more time to sit around his cabin playing with the severed head of his long deceased mommy...Thats about all this remake adds to the Friday the 13th franchise. Jason is still a big brooding confused retard with a mother complex. And there are unfortunately still a load of stupid, stoned, nubile, annoying young adults who will offer themselves up for slaughter at Camp Crystal Lake."
3,Not as good,"I'm very disappointed, this movie should be called Friday The 13th XIV, and not a remake from the original Friday The 13th. It's not scary at all, like the other ones that keep you in that suspense mood."
3,Friday The 13th Killer Cut is a 3.5/5 Star DVD,Well after a long lay over from Friday the 13th movies Jason returns again with another slashing thriller. I have to say when I bought this movie I was looking forward to it because they had not made one in so long it was refreshing and did not seem boring. While the plot of the movie is much like all the other ones I think they still did a good job. There are two parts of this movie and this will fool you when you watch it so you have to pay attention. There is a lot of blood and sex in this movie so they tried to bring in two different type of movie fans. The killings were done unique as well and I enjoyed some of those scenes to. Overall I have to say that this was a thrilling movie. Jason delivers here and I would go 3.5 out of 5 stars and a good return to the big screen for Jason.
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"This movie is so bad, I don't know where to begin. I know this series of movies is not Academy Award material, but the previous films were somewhat entertaining. This feels like it was written by a 14 year old. It is moronic beyond description. Now, I have no problem with sex and drugs. Hell, I grew up in the 80's!! But that's all this movie is. Kids getting high, kids having sex, Jason dismembering kids. Not one of them is even remotely sympathetic. You will root for Jason all the way. At least I did. The killing scenes are somewhat well done, and the effects are pretty good. But that is hardly enough to make a good film. Now, I'm not a huge Michael Bay fan, and his company that does all these remakes has churned out some decent films. The new Nightmare On Elm Street comes to mind. That is a pretty good remake. But Friday the 13th??? As Archie Bunker would say: Crapola!!!"
2,Friday the 13th(2009),"This Friday the 13th remake from 2009 is either a piece of trash or a decent remake depending on your standards. It takes 22 minutes to get to the film's title. The sex scene with Julianna Guill is very dirty for a mainstream movie! Most of the characters are very annoying. There's a lot of scenes of brutality where Jason Voorhees stabs people or smashes them into cars and sharp objects! This film preserves many slasher movie cliches. Still, the movie is photogenic and the acting is decent.You can hear a few seconds of Manfredini's Friday the 13th music score. Watch this movie at your own risk!"
2,"5 star for the DVD itself, 1 star for the movie","Really pretty good DVD for a terrible movie. I am a Friday the 13th fan and a completest. I own this DVD simply because I am a completest, however I can't recommend buying this DVD or even the blu-ray. It is just a bad movie from beginning to end."
3,This Remake Was Pointless,"This Michael Bay production is a graphic homage to the series that helped turn simple slasher pictures into a formula for success. It may have Bay's big-budget sheen, and it's every bit as efficient and heartless as the original Fridays. But for all its attempted jolts, it's not all that scary. The genre is reduced to ""Who gets it next and how?"" and never for a second makes us care.*ZI"
1,so sad,"I have been a fan of all horror films since I was young and crazy about friday the 13th, I was so upset I went to go see this in the movies, it was HORRIBLE nothing at all like the originals nothing even was close to it. Such a disappointment, you are better off getting the original DO NOT WASTE A PENNY ON THIS"
2,WAS THIS A PARODY?,"I admit, there were some good kill scenes, but for the most part; this wasn't good. It wasn't bad either. It could've been alot more atmospheric and creepy. I didn't get scared at all. I like the remake of such old gems like HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and even TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. This can't come close.I was really hoping for Jason to be more in the background, to build up the suspense, but instead we get lame sex scenes and Jason running all over the place like he's a damn realestate agent.I liked a couple of the characters in this flick, more than in previous Fridays, but it was just lacking creepiness. Not worth buying, almost not worth renting....sorry folks, this lacks the scare factor."
1,That's Enough Now Jason,"It is a known fact that there are eight ""Friday the 13th"" films excluding ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,"" ""Jason X"" and ""Freddy vs. Jason."" Add those to the other eight and that makes eleven. ""Friday the 13th"" (2009) makes twelve. That's enough now, Jason.Horny, rambunctious kids just can't stay away from Camp Crystal Lake. They never got the memo in the 80s, and apparently not here in 2009. Just like you've seen before (in eight other films remember?) these kids were stabbed, slashed, impaled, and so on and so forth.Every ""Friday the 13th"" film has been indistinguishable from the last. So then what's new with the `09 remake? Other than a modern look, not much. Same old story, same old characters and the same old ending. No suspense, no thrilling moments because, once again, it's been done eight other times! At least the 1980 original is still capable of being fresh."
3,Guilty pleasure alert,"The Bottom Line:This remake/reboot of Friday the 13th isn't very good at all but I've seen every Friday film and if I can safely report that not one of them (except maybe the original IF I'm in a good mood) is legitimately praise-worthy film so that's hardly the issue--the only thing worth reporting is that this Friday delivers the gratuitous nudity (topless water skiing?) inventive deaths, and one-note characters central to the franchise about as well as could possibly be done with a (mostly) straight face.2/4"
2,Juggs and Serial Killin',Nothing like a good Friday The 13th movie. What could be better than mixing stupid teens lots of sex and nudity and gory murder by a serial killer all rolled into one. This movie was kind of funny to watch and the boobs and nudity were excellent but it was still the same tired old Friday the 13th saga. Enjoy it. Have fun with it but... don't stay at that summer camp... EVER!
2,GO BACK AND WATCH THE REGINAL AGAIN!!!,"If u grew up in 80s like me, U do have memory of original friday the13, back in the day.. as scary images, killing parts the music and cast, just the whole package was awesome to this day,watched it many times , so the others! Skip this remake,just trashy chezzy looks and cast ,Then Forgettable soon as movie ends! B.S C"
2,A cold and unremarkable remake...,"Although this may be a faithful remake something is seriously lacking in the execution. I would like to blame casting as each seemed to missed cast - especially Jason. The teenage crew is obnoxious and there isn't one that you don't wish to meet a horrible end. I think there was a movie here somewhere however between the casting, acting, writing, editing and cutting it just didn't make it out.The movie left me cold.See the original. Buy the original. This movie is a waste of time."
2,Unimpressed,"I could not wait to see this movie and when I did I was soooo disappointed. I am a huge fan of the original Friday the 13th movies, they are some of my favorites. This was written terrible. There's so much sex that it takes away from what should be a horror movie and makes it into softcore. I'm not a prude, I understand that for the most part horror movies have some nuidty and sex in them but this was excessive. I think the sex and nudity was a filler because the writer was at a loss for material. You'll notice in other Friday the 13th movies there's like 1-2 scenes of nudity and it's over with and on to the killing and gore. This movie was made for the sake of sex scenes, it was awkward and stupid. The kills were unlike Jason, he never ran like this, he never kept trinkets from his victims. This should have been a completely different movie. Sorry, this is not the Jason I know and adore. 1.5 to 2 stars, if that."
2,Stop After the Fourth Cut,"This CD is like two EPs stuck together, one good one bad. The first half of the CD is entertaining, but I never listen past that anymore. The second half isn't that good."
3,Shoulda been a contender...,"This ep just seemed like such a disappointment to me. Two great bands. One small cd. One standout track (the ridiculous, slit-your-wrists mixtape ender ""Believe""). There were too few rough edges, and it seemed like the strengths of both groups sort of neutralized each other, producing something that is merely pleasant."
5,Married to John Wayn's #1 Fan,"Being married to John Wayne's #1 fan, I must admit I have become his #2. We have nearly all of the John Wayne classics (not some of his real early ones) but the rest and this fits right in with the best of them. Love the western genre and much better than some of the stuff on t.v. these days - would highly recommend."
3,odd.........?,"Seems an odd mix here, a vintage Wayne film and one of his last. These films were released almost 30 years apart. Both are decent westerns, neither considered among Wayne's best, though the earlier one features Gabby Hayes and that is reason alone for aquiring.As for the Train Robbers, it's a decent but lightweight film with fun byplay between members of the Wayne troop and Ann Margaret is certainly attractive. It does have a bit of a twist at the end. But Wayne at the end of his illustrious career is just a bit too long of tooth to carry off the potential romance angle that's supposed to exist with Margaret, as evidenced by him telling her that his saddle is older than she is.Just wondering if we are going into a period of repackaging Wayne films ala Elvis and every song he ever recorded."
3,Definitely not Block's best Scudder novel,"While this book did have an entertaining plot, a woman is suspected of being killed by the icepick prowler, but turns out that she wasn't killed by him when he confesses to 7 of the 8 murders he was suspected of. Scudder is thrown into the mix to investigate whether Barbara Ettinger was killed by the Icepick Prowler or a copycat killer. While it is an entertaining and easy read, I felt at times that the quality of writing wasn't nearly as good as 2 of his best scudder novels ever: ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" and ""A Dance at the Slaughterhouse"". I just wasn't satisified with the quality of this book, I felt it could have been better. That tends to be the way Block's books are with me, they are either a hit or a miss."
5,Russell,"I have been a fan of his since the stylistics. He like charlie wilson are the old school kings. He has one of the sweetest tenors i've heard. Can't wait for another cd to come forth. I'm waiting patiently, and pray it's soon."
3,"The Voice Lives On,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,But","I felt that the production on this CD just did not cut it. I am a lifetime Stylistics fan and continue to support their (HIS) incredible sound. It is wonderful to hear Mr.Russell Thompkins Jr hit those beautiful notes I just wish he would (or will) seek additional ""Outside"" writing and production for this (or his next) venture. You Still Sound Fantastic Mr. Stylistic but you deserve much better than synthetic keys and drums. Ray, Goodman & Brown (The Moments) used the same approach on their latest lp with less greater results. You gentleman are a treasure and should be produced as such!"
4,That Sweet Stylistics Soul lives on with Russell!,"As a 26 year veteran of radio--especially Oldies and R & B--I've gotta say this voice is unforgettable! ""You Are Everything"", ""Rock and Roll Baby"", ""Betcha By Golly Wow"", ""You Make Me Feel Brand New""...Russell Thompkins, Jr. has given us some of the best-remembered songs of the 70's. You want romance? Just flip on ""A Matter of Style"". What Barry White does on the low end, Russell does on the high! This guy has actually improved over the years! Listen to the hooky ""No One In The World"", the smooth jazz of ""Jealousy"" or the Soul Groove of the sexy ""Summer Love"". The Stylistics are remembered most of all for their incredible vocals. This is the guy right here!A nicely produced contemporary sound from one of all-time classic voices. All I can say is--Gentlemen, do you want your lady to melt into your arms? This CD is sure fire! And Ladies...Russell has still got IT. With a capitol I and a capitol T! You know what I'm talking about!"
5,A Matter of Style,I love Russell Thompkins the lead singer of the Stylictics; this man can sing!!! This package arrived on time and I played on daily basis.
3,Interesting beginning,This very short guidebook to latex and leather clothing care is based on experience and some education. Frankly I was disappointed by the lack of details on how to care for items and how to fix items that are often quite expensive to purchase in the first place. Also I had unanswered questions which I had hoped the book would cover such as what do you do if you want a wet or slippery feel on the inside your latex outfit? Also it would be great if Thibault had discussed way the costs of many latex and leather goods are so high for some types of clothing and tools while it is cheap for others.
4,invaluable leather aid,"This book is a great little volume which all leather and latex devotees will find indispensable. Some of it is common sense, other parts of it very useful even to those who have been looking after their items for a long time. I myself found it very useful for tips on taking care of latex which for one reason or another some of us may be too embarassed to ask about in a shop (me included!). This volume is hard to get hold of but well worth the effort - buy it now!"
3,Great... if you have the correct headgear,"This chin strap is great on the kliff keen tornado headgear because the chine strap gives you two buttons to connect to both sides of the headgear.This chin strap does not work so well on the kliff keen clam shell headgear because it only has a button on one side of the headgear.This meant that I had to manually put in the chin strap. It also limits the length of the chinstrap, making it extremely uncomfortable especially when I wear a mouth-guard.The chin strap is also too big and can suck your chin while wrestling, which is annoying.Thumbs up if you wear this strap with a tornado headgearThumbs down if you wear this strap with a clam shell headgear"
4,Chin Cup,The only bad thing about the chin cup is it has no ventilation so sweat collects in the cup as you are wrestling.
4,Good deal,"I ordered this movie for my dad for Father's Day. The product arrived in perfect condition and on schedule. The movie quality is good with no complaints there. I will order other classic movies like ""Uptown Saturday Night"" again."
3,21st century Paxton,"It is an enjoyable album. However, the witty pointedness present in Tom Paxton's 60's and 70's albums, is gone. Instead there are relevant social comments, a tribute to the fire fighting crews attending the September eleven catastrophe and the odd love song, often performed in a country and western style not present in Paxton's earlier albums."
4,"Unique, fun to watch, simply delightful","There are four cartoons on this tape; the best one is The Three Robbers. It is a funny, charming story. Ever since we bought it we have watched it several times and it just gets better every time we watch it. The best part is that all of the sound effects are done by voice, no instruments, just a voice. It's like watching someone put on a one-man puppet show, doing all his own voices and sounds. The other three cartoons are unique as well; you won't find cartoons like these on TV. It's like a treasure from the past; and I know we will enjoy this tape for years to come."
2,Not happy with this hammer,"I am building a stone wall. I had wanted to buy an Estwing hammer but went to True Value instead of Ace. Saw this hammer and decided to by it. Looked like a great hammer. Went to trim my first stone ane noticed a big gouge in the chisel edge. Very, very disappointed. Isn't this supposed to be a hardened tool. Will keep it but really unhappy. Who cares if it doesn't vibrate when it won't keep an edge. Bummer."
3,Buy only if you have another spare ones....,"Hey...The device works good and sound quality is competitive but it has 2 negative points.1. The 2 buds may make the ear fitting perfect but if u are using them for long time(> 2 hours), they will really hurt you.2. The wire of device is packaged in circular way so it will always entangle."
4,"You will hear a good sound, but you won't feel it","It has a long enough durable cord, and its design makes it fit really good in your ear. The sound quality is high as is expected from Sennheiser, but it's a little bit low in power. The volume variation is also not too much."
4,Good but not great,"These earphones sound clear without the overdone bass and background noise. However, the locking system is awkward and a bit uncomfortable when you first put it in and when taking it out."
4,Deserves a 4 1/2,"Great price for the sound quality. The bass is deep and clear enough to hear all of Flea's intricate lines and all other sounds come at you well balanced and very clear. The design is a bit awkward at first, but once you're used to it, you realize that it allows a snug fit and therefore great sound. The only reason this product doesn't get 5 stars is because one of the main rubber parts came off and got lost easily, which is OK because you have replacements that can substitute. And speaking of parts, customization is good because you really want these buds to fit well to make the most of the quality sound they can provide. The volume control comes in handy too."
2,Not worth the money,I was waiting for this product but i was shocked !!! @@ NOT AS I EXPECTED .. the sound quality is as same as the iPod earphones. Doesn't look as nice as advertised. The price is very expensive for this earphones. The new feature doesn't securly fit in the outer ear. This is definitly one of SENNHEISERs mistakes !!! i was a big fan of thier product Now i'm NOT.
3,great sound... until you lose a bit,"I was really happy with these headphones for a few months. They have great sound when properly positioned, and are quite comfortable. But then I pulled them out of their little pouch one day only to find that one of the little rubber pads had disappeared. Luckily, they had included 3 of each size in the package. Which was great, until I lost another. Now I have to see if they will give me a replacement set at a reasonable cost, or I just have to find a different model that sounds as good, without the easily lost bits."
3,shipping was good but.......,The shipping was goodbut I hoped more for the productearphone good but no very goodis that allthanks Amazon for this.regardshector.
4,The values in the organization.,"It,s true that our mode of behaving in the organization depends greatly on our values we have in our life. Also how we think affect our attitude toward our personal role in the organizing process. it,s not easy to become selfless and humble to fit better in the teams set up in the organization. We need some guide to reprogram ourselves in order to smooth our role we play in the organizing process. The book ""Classics of organizational behavior"" could be a base to clarify those items mentioned above and many other still to be known. Anyone working in an organization should have such great book in his/her collections. Very Truly Yours, Rodulfo Geerman"
5,A fabulous knitting book!!,"This book is extremely well done; the sweater designs are superb, and there are several interesting techniques included with some of the designs. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I don't usually ""read"" knitting books, but the author's descriptions of her visits to the various farms are really interesting and fun to read. The accompanying photographs are excellent. I also really appreciated the inclusion of substitute yarn suggestions for those of us who might not have access to the specialty yarns used in the book. This book is a terrific addition to my knitting library, and I hope to purchase more of her books in the future."
4,A wonderful source book!,Great patterns by a master knitter emlivened by the most wonderful wool yarns searched out by the author from New England artisans. A definite must-have book for your knitting library.
3,A wonderful source book for beautiful yarns!,"The farms and wool producers visited by the author are really wonderful, and make the book worth buying. I found the patterns to be uninspiring and a disappointment considering the great yarns the author had to work with. I would buy this book again, but only for the source information on the wool producers."
4,Nice escape read,Very entertaining book. Well written but not a deep think type of book. I travel a lot and it was a nice relaxing read on planes.
5,Laugh Out Loud Hilarity,"If you are a lover of the absurd and are looking for a quick read, this is it. Don't judge the story as a simple gloss over of a typical supernatural battle plot. Witty dialogue, fully fleshed out characters and a compelling story line. It is a book not to start early in the evening because you will be up until 3 am racing for the end."
3,Wicked and Weird.,"I can't remember where I first heard of this book but I do remember being so intrigued by the blurb that I just had to read it. Fortunatly it was coming to paperback and I was able to get a copy. The book is about Duke (a werewolf) and Earl (a vampire) who are driving in the south when they come upon a small town diner Gil's. I'm not going to give the plot away but there are zombies, ghosts, and an teenage sorceress. Basically the town Gil's is located in is a magnet for the macabre. The writing is easy to follow and quite enjoyable. The story at times is funny and at others creepy and the book is so fast paced anyone could read it in a couple sittings. Martinez has an interesting way of writing and I am eager to find out what he'll do next."
3,Not as funny as I hoped it would be,"I guess I was expecting too much from this book after reading the other reviews, but I didn't feel this book was that funny. It's okay and has its moments. Book can be passed on unless you have nothing else to read."
2,A star for concept/another for cover--but the fat jokes sank it for me,"I don't think I've ever written a negative review on Amazon before, and I'm sorry to feel compelled to do so. But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover. I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly. I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people. As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes. Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor. This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47 I was offended enough not to want to read the rest. Life is short. There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women. I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying."
4,A nice mix of creatures,"Sure a werewolf and a vampire can have a lasting, deep friendship although their small quirks annoy each other. They can even work well together to save a town (and all known creation) from supreme evil and sure doom. And maybe one of them will come out of it all with a girlfriend..."
4,A Fun First Novel,"A. Lee Martinez displays a great sense of humor in his first novel. I liked the flow. It was easy to read and the characters were fun to read about. He sort of makes up the rules as he goes along, which makes for a work that doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters are not fully developed, but they don't have to be in this type of light comedy. It kept me reading to find out what was going to happen, and that is what I want from any novel. I kept wondering if Duke and Earl got their names from the old song Duke of Earl or if giving the current conditions in the world, the diner actually exists."
3,Two guys save the world.,"After reading (on Brian's recommendation) The Automatic Detective, I stopped in at Powell's to pick up something else by Martinez. Helpful staff pointed me toward this--he had also read Automatic Detective, and Gil's All Fright Diner was the other book he'd heard friends talk about.The characters are warm, well rounded, and engaging, but the story seems insubstantial and light (which is odd for another Cthuloid elder god summoning end of the world plot), and there's a bit too much 'tell don't show'. It's got a Douglas Adams flavor, but with half the calories and no fat. I enjoyed it, but I was hungry again twenty minutes later."
5,I HATE A. Lee Martinez - HATE!,"Then why did I give his book 5 stars? Quite frankly I'd give anything he's written 5 stars - and I've read them all - because they are great reads full of memorable characters and interesting and amusing situations. He has a weird and twisted manner of writing - I love that about his work.So why do I hate him? BECAUSE EVERY DANGED BOOK HE'S WRITTEN SHOULD HAVE A SEQUEL - THEY'RE JUST THAT GOOD!I guess what I'm saying is that you won't be sorry if you read ANY of his books, but you might start with Gil's All Fright Diner. It's a favorite. He definitely puts his own spin on vampires and werewolves."
4,Funny urban (rural?) fantasy,"This would be urban fantasy, except it's set in a rural town in the middle of no where. The book is hilarious from beginning to end. A simple plot, the characters really are the story here, and Martinez really brings the characters to life, even if half of them are already dead. Recommended for anyone with a sense of humor."
5,TAPPING HORROR'S FUNNY BONE!,"I loved this book from the first page to the last. Earl and Duke are by far two of the most ""human"" monsters I have ever encountered. This story rocks with a rollicking, tongue-in-cheekflavor that left me wanting more, lots, lots more! A.Lee Martinezgoes on my must-buy list from now on."
4,Much like Douglas Adams,"The overall tenure of the book is a lot like Douglas Adams' novels, but definitely more American-style humor. While I don't mind the cursing and sex-based jokes, I can see where some might find it a bit ""lower-brow,"" so to speak, than Adams' work. I think it's a relatively funny novel, and very interesting (like another reviewer, I started reading it and couldn't put it down).Overall, worth reading, but maybe see if you can get it from the library or from a friend - I don't know if I would purchase this book again, as it's just another paperback sitting on my shelf that I will probably not read again... Then again, if it were being sold used for the right price, it's probably worth it.EDIT: I should mention, in order to be fair to the author, that I purchased two other books by the same author, as I was entertained by Gil's All Fright Diner. So, by no means is this an admonition of the book as negative - I just wanted to let others know what to expect."
3,sledge hammer,The product I received is a JACKSON brand. I bought this tool because I wanted the Ames True Temper brand warranty.
4,Fast Danceing Drum'n'Bass,"CD 1 is 90's Jungle, CD 2 is Drum'n'Bass like today and is wery good and Mixed by Kenny Ken. This is incredible good CD's, i thing this is the one of my mix CD's but the traking list on Amason is not rhigt, Roni Size,Krust, Origin Unknown - Valley Of The Shadows ans many more trax are not ther."
5,"Perfect for your ""old school"" dance parties.","I'll let you in on a little secret. The Old School Jams"" compilation series is more than enough for any throwback party. Volumes 1-7 come with full 12-inch versions of those hard to find songs from back in the day! I wish they were available as digital downloads but it's worth every penny to order the cd collection. Whenever I play a live site, best believe I have all seven volumes ready to go! You can't go wrong with the funk of One Way, Parliament, or the likes of Kool and the Gang! Someone at the party is bound to ask if you have Vaughn Mason and Crew, some Cheryl Lynn, or Mtume. There are plenty of ""old school"" compilations out but this series is the most complete and the 12"" dance versions make for a DJs mixing delight.EnjoyDJ Come of Age"
3,old jams,"Pretty standard cd I only bought it for a few tracks , mtume,cheryl lynn gap band but most of all barbara mason another man CLASSIC TRACK"
5,Awesome retrospective!,"Finally a CD that covers all years of the Whitesnake catalog instead of just the ""Slide It In"" through ""Slip Of The Tongue"" eras of the band. The most enjoyable part for me is the addition of the 1983 video version of ""Guilty Of Love"" for the first time which so far is only available here (except the deleted VHS video). This CD is the best Whitesnake compilation since 1983's ""Best Of"" set which is now extremely hard to find..."
5,Best Corvette Stat Book You Can Buy,This book is stuffed with production numbers & codes to allow anyone to decide the rarity of any specific vette. Option codes can be deciphered & one can see if options present are original.Don't buy a used Corvette without it !
4,Good value,"Keeps food/drinks cold and ice did not melt during the 12 - 14 hrs we used it daily on a trip. Good capacity, sturdy construction with good handles. Only issue is that it is a bit hard to open, but perhaps the snug fit is what helps it work so well. I think it is a good product at a good price."
4,Good ice chest,"This ice chest is lower and wider than the previous model.It fits well in the back of a SUV along with 2 other ice chests.I am sure it is designed for casserole dishes, I use it for tailgating beverages.Easy to keep clean."
2,Disappointed,"I have read the 3 Edwardian mysteries by Marion Chesney before this one, and enjoyed them very much. This one is a great disappointment. It is extremely choppy. The story doesn't flow, and doesn't give a feel for the period. The characters are very shallow."
1,Worked For Only 2 Days,"I thought this was absolutely amazing when I filled it with water and watched it work. Two days later, it began to dim and I refilled it. Yet, the display didn't come back as bright. I read the instruction manual and discovered my water may have been low on salt. I added salt to the chambers and the display brightened. This only lasted one day. I refilled it again with tap water and salt, but it didn't come back as brightly. I tried several times to flush the system and give it fresh water and salt. However, the display just never lit up the way it did at Day One, and it couldn't maintain the time correctly. I was very disappointed as this seemed like an awesome clock."
1,Not worth it!!!,"This is just another item that looks good on paper, but does not work.I followed the instructions and was able to see the time for a minute or so, then it died."
1,"Nice, but it doesn't keep time....",I got this for my wife because she is into science. We instantly noticed that it doesn't keep time. Not sure what we're doing wrong or of the product is just junk. I wouldn't recommend.
4,Very cool idear,Very cool idear but run s slow or fast seem not to keep very good time. It is cool to have a different way of using water to run a clock. I bought it for a teck kind of guy and he loves it.
3,NICE ENOUGH,"This is an ok blankey, but if you are looking for a really soft and cuddlable one you will have to pay about $100 more. I returned this one and got a 75% merino and 25% cashmere one called ""Tuscany"" sold by an outfit lin Florida for about $250 (queen), and I am satisfied. Pure cashmere, of course, would be better--consult your financial planner."
4,Clear Tote,"This bag is the perfect size, not too big or small. The quality is good and is pretty much what I expected."
5,You have helped so many people with your book. You have changed their lives,"Nancy, God bless you! You have done unimanigable GOOD for people. You don't realize that you are a VERY VERY IMPORTANT person to so many people. You have helped and changed their lives with your wonderful book. Thank you for all you have done for my people and myself. Teresita Tinajero, Director Instito de Tanatology, Mexico City D. F. Mexico,"
5,Great for Exploring Rambles,"I get to New York often, though I am a Chicagoan. Done a lot of urban exploring throughout the five boroughs, but always knew I was missing lots of hidden stories--So last trip I got Forgotten New York, and learned more about New York. Read that cover to cover, and loved it. But I still was missing parts of the city.. the quirky little islands I caught glimpses of from the air, or on the ferry to Staten Island. This book does a great job of giving the history, feel of these places. Well written, full of great information. I am picking out an itinerary for my next trip as I write this review.Thanks to the authors for recognizing a gap in New York exploration guides and for filling it very well!"
2,I was disappointed,"I expected more projects and descriptions, not just a few masks. I was going to use it for my Spanish Club, but I cannot find anything useful, sorry."
1,Very disappointing,"The photos are black and white and very poor quality. The crafts themselves are not very inspired. I gave this one star because, for the price, the book was a definite disappointment."
4,It works,"As far as I know, It works. However, it appears that you can also use regular cheap miniDVs to record in HD format. I haven't figured out yet if the expensive ones (that come in separate cases) are really superior to the regular cheap ones."
1,Illustrator 9 for Dummies,This book was difficult to get information out of due to the constant attempt to make every thing humerous. Found it to be more frustrating than useful.
1,I'm no dummy!,"I only got 2 chapters into this book and closed it with the thought.... Why not give me step by step ways of doing what you show on the page. This book just has a glossy overview of it's features, but the author falls short in giving clear steps in the process of duplicating the book examples.I returned it and ordered Adobe's book. I'm hoping it's better."
3,Good Content,"The content of the book was very good. The proofreading of the book was positively AWFUL. I had to mark the rating down 2 stars because of the HORRIBLE proofreading. The layout, design and content of the book was definitely appropriate for a beginner, but it was sure hard seeing correct programming syntax with so many proofreading errors."
5,Doesn't Get Better Than This,"As an introduction to the topic, this book assumes nothing and guides the reader. It is simple and also deep. Have not found a better book."
3,"Book good, Kindle edition poor","I agree with the other review: this book is not good on the Kindle, at least not for me. The tables are hard to read, and the table text cannot be re-sized. Also, for me, it's too hard to flip back and forth to re-read previously-read material on the Kindle. I'd rather have a hard copy of technical books like this, in which I can flip rapidly through the pages looking for something I remember reading previously, but did not bookmark.Otherwise, good book for learning VBScripting. I'll probably buy the hard copy, and I'll bet I rate it higher."
4,Good 1st step for begin programmer.,"I was a VBA programmer with MS Access, I was excited with this book. I liked to learn about other aspects of the programming languages."
5,Good book for the beginner,I'm currently using this book in a college course. It's a great book for the beginner and it will be a great reference for the experienced programmer.
2,Not on the Kindle . . .,"Much of the core information is contained in images rather than text format. The images are not provided in high enough resolution to be readable. It may have been more convenient to scan the tables rather than input them, but the net result is that the reader has to get this information by researching on the Internet or referring to another resource."
5,"Used but in good condition, as advertised.",Book is in good condition and delivered quickly. Seller is a ***** out of *****.
1,Not what I thought,From what I can tell..this is a cheap beeping alarm clock with little chimes attached that you can manually stroke for the chime to sound. From what was advertised...I had the impression that you could set the alarm and the chime would sound...wrong.
1,undocumented battery,"I didn't have a problem with the clock itself, but the wind chimes never worked. I finally took the clock apart and found the arm with a magnet had come out of its position. I put it back and tried again to no avail. Re-opened the clock and found an undocumented button battery hard wired in. The battery is encased in plastic with no visible way of extracting it or see what kind it is. Not sure if it is a battery to work the articulated magnetic arm, but without documentation, it isn't worth the trouble it would take to find out considering its cost. A nice idea poorly implemented."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with my wind chime alarm clock. I got one from my son last year for Christmas and was very happy. I LOVE the hourly chime and so do all my kids! The bar that makes the chimes sound broke and I wanted to try to replace the clock without my son knowing it. I ordered another one and the hourly chime did not work. I requested to send it back and get a replacement. Customer service said to keep the original one I was sent and they would replace it. Somehow I managed to have 2 more show up and only one of those works on the hourly chime. I am thankful customer service did a good job of taking care of me however I am disappointed the product is made so cheaply that my original one broke after one year and of the 3 I have had in the last 2 weeks or so, only one of those works! The chime sound is fabulous if the product actually works!"
1,chime clock review,"I found this product to be virtually impossible to use. It was difficult to set and came with instructions that were so complicated I could not figure them out. I sent this back and purchased another chime clock from another source. They were very nice when I called to say I was returning this one, and were prompt in refunding the cost. I was responsible to pay return postage though."
4,Good Family Show,"Show follows the adventures of two brothers, that are gifted in their own ways. Math Genius brother, helps out his FBI brother and team solve cases with the use of math."
4,creative storyline,"This episode's storyline is creative, yes there are the usual gun fights and chase scenes, but all of those scenes are tailored to mesh with a comic book forgery. I thought the little twists on the guns and chases were delightful. And I won't give away the ending but watch until the very last frame, that and the last few minutes are fun if you like comic art. Oh and Colby has an unexpected twist this episode, should be fun to see it emerge."
4,Love the Product Not Pleased with Shipping,We were happy with the product and the quality that it was in..SHIPPING on the other hand took ALONG time...The items arrived almost 2 weeks after the 'expected arrival date.
2,Numb3rs Season 4 - Short season - Full price,"I love the series and already purchased the first 3 seasons from Amazon. But, since season #4 was an abridged season (writers' strike) and you only get 5 DVDs for @ 720 minutes of viewing why would I want to pay such a high price? I suggest that the cost of season 4 should be discounted by Amazon to account for the reduced quantity of episodes. Even David Krumholtz would agree with these numb3rs."
4,I thought in this episode that Coby played a strong & determined person to survive!,This show was one of the more intensified episodes & intruging as well! The mystery of the cyber person kept you on your toes!
5,Great service,Product arrived in a timely manner and was in the exact condition promised would definitely buy from seller again.
5,Numb3rs season 4,The DVD set arrived quickly and is in perfect shape. I am really enjoying it. There are lots of interesting DVD extras that are well worth buying the set and then the series is just great.
3,Maybe time to move on,I enjoyed the first two seasons very much but now the plots are getting a little thin on the ground maybe it's time to move on like some of the characters.
4,Numbers- The complete fourth season,I never got to see these when they first came on tv. It was very good. Really exciting.
1,Useful info surrounded by boring prattle,"This book is full of interesting facts but it is ruined by the way the author continually tells the reader that the average man in the street is always taken in by fallacious facts.At one point the author says ""Experts are valuable people in their own field but when they stray into other areas of knowledge ... they are as susceptible to error as anybody else."" I couldn't agree more, the author should stick to being a scientist and forget any notions he has of being a writer."
4,A Wonderful Story of a Bygone Era,"After reading this book on vacation, I wondered how much of this story is factual. A truly interesting tale; a romance novel...with enough technical jargon to keep me interested! If you can find it, I believe you'll like it. Seth P. Wissner"
1,Didn't help me much.,"First off the author isn't much of an artist and he doesn't even try to teach you anything. It is just a bunch of the guys work with a comment for each. It says on the back of the book that it teaches you how to hold a pencil properly which it does not do. The book is pretty much all based on composition not sketching. I'm sending this one back.I have just finished reading ""The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" and I totally recomend it. It took about a week to go through. After that week I was about 5 times better than before. No joke, I was totally suprised."
5,Just as Expected,This book was just as described. In perfect condition and arrived a little ahead of time. I'm very pleased with it and my experience with both Amazon and the seller.
4,Living Pilgrim,This is living the pilgrim religion yesterday and today. It's the story of a Russian peasant's search for the secrets of prayer. The real die hards fast until Thanksgiving. This should be required reading for college students.
5,Spiritually Invigorating,"This book provides as much cultural appeal as it does spiritual. The author is rich in his descriptions of 19th century Russia, and the experiences that he has when traveling throughout the land. The spirituality is rich for people of many different traditions, as it is a universal struggle of finding ourselves and how we relate to God. The author's angst and joy in practicing and mastering the ""Jesus Prayer"" is both sincere and fascinating. I have no doubt that readers will strengthen their own spiritual journeys when reading this book."
5,A simple text with profound insight.,"A wonderful Zen proverb says that ""when the student is ready, the teacher will appear."" This highly readable account of a Russian peasant in search of pure prayer crossed my path at just the right time. We readers follow the peasant's journey after he hears St. Paul's exhortation to ""pray without ceasing."" Through monastery and village, through rain and warmth, he follows that hunger that we all feel for a purposeful life, for a deeper awareness of the Divine in our mundane lives. The Way of a Pilgrim mustn't be read only once, but savored and mined with re-reads. The book offers a glimpse through one doorway that leads to a new life -- The Jesus Prayer."
4,Prayer changes everything,"Mr. C.S. Lewis once observed, ""Prayer does not change God, it changes me."" This is much the theme of this simple yet profound little book. It is the story of a young man on a quest for a greater intimacy with God and how he discovers it in the simple words of a simple prayer of confession. This book can help Christians of all persuasions look to the right source for intimacy with God. It's not just for the Orthodox to learn this humble but powerful lesson of a life changed by way of prayer."
5,Good! Everyone should read this.,"If you want to know the truth about the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, this is the source. The author was one of the eminently qualified people who pursued the study of the bombing and produced this book. It is well researched, well written, and quotes research by many extremely well qualified individuals, including several eyewitnesses and victims of the bombing. The only qualification I would add is that it comprises 364 pages of fine print, with an additional 184 pages of pictures and supporting documentation.You have not read the complete story until you've read this. The ""official version"" is nothing like this."
4,Tarzan/10,"These movies were great! I had seen Tarzan the Ape Man at the theater, but I had never watched 10. Great movies and great price!"
2,Only for Hard Core Fans...,"Since we see so little of Tower on conventional media (a head-scratcher for sure) I applaud the Germans for wanting to capture this great band--and if they had some audio folks that understood how to mix, this would be a very exciting disc.As it is, it documents a good performance with a good lineup on the band, but because the audio is so bad (it sounds as tho it was recorded with a cassette recorder at the back of the hall) it really brings the presentation down.I'm a fan, and would rather have something than nothing, but I really can't recommend this as a good representation of one of my favorite all-time bands.Sadly..."
3,not the greatest that I have seen,"Sound quality is not that great...wish that it had more options as well. I was very excited to see that this DVD was coming out and now I am disappointed of what I got. Good tunes, but not at powerful sounding as it could be. As I watched it for the first time I could barely hear the bass thumping through the band. Good for a collector, but not for someone wanting the power that this band should project."
2,just ok,i have to agree with previous reviews. i bought this dvd with such high hopes since it is the only live thing out there that i know of. i am a drummer/musician for over 40 yrs but it doesn't take much to know that the sound is SO bad which is such a shame for such a GREAT band - nowhere close to the energy of a REAL live show. it's good to have but you have to use your imagination to fill in the gaps of how great it could and should have been!!! we can only hope for something in the future - i certainly do. what is hip? this dvd ain't.
1,Blrk.!!!,"This is not good, great band but the sound sucks donkey!! Jesse McGuire plays great tough!! Vaste of money!!"
2,pick up a cd,Television recordings are destined for failure audio-wise. If you pick up a copy of TOP live at the Fillmore '98 you'll hear it's a shame this performance wasn't filmed/recorded in HD with audio to match. Whoever did the mixing on this CD did a wonderful job. Everyone bass note and snare hit can be heard. Seems so somebody out there might be interested in giving us a quality DVD!

5,Sailormoon,"I don't have this, but can someone who has it put down what the tracks are? I'm looking for the Neptune and Uranus transformation song. It rocks!"
4,Latin Jazz,Very nice Cd with a broad variety of classic latin Jazz. I like it in my collection and would recommend it .
2,approach with caution,"This cd is the kind of artefact that can give pop a bad name. The ""European"" pop it espouses is a shrill pastiche of a pastiche. Girly vocals and lots of synths predominate, so if that's your bag you're on safe territory."
3,"Okay, not really worth the price.","This set wasn't really worth the price. Those cardboard easel/frames are just garbage.The scratch sheets are all small, should have been a regular sized piece of paper.But the grandkids did have fun scratching to see what appears underneath."
4,My Daughter Like it,"It has got a real nice box but when you open it up you dont get that much for the kids to play with. With that said, my daughter did like what she got and was creating and singing while she played.So based on what I saw from her reactions I would say it would be a worthwhile addition to a young persons creativity."
4,Perfect gifts for birthdays.,"I saw these from someone's house and decided to buy this as a gift, it turns out to be a huge success and should have bought more as holiday gifts!"
2,Not happy at all!!!,"I am very disappointed with this product. I have bought scratchart before and love it for my 8 yr old. However, this product was sold to me for $27.99 and I was expecting a much higher quality of product. This product is not worth more than $10 at the most. In fact, a week after purchasing this product, it is listed for $13. I got swindled and am very unhappy."
3,Comprehensive analysis of satellite communications,"Perhaps THE best book I've seen that provides rigorous link budget analyses, all fully tailored to ground-air propagation. Introduces the Crane (ITU-R) rainfall model, as it applies to ground-air (as opposed to ground-ground) data links. Also provides a readable and informative narrative of satellite television broadcasting, and other commercial satellite services."
2,"Advanced, better know what you're doing before hand...","Book covers alot of topics within satellite comms and has problems associated for you to take. No solutions are provided though and on the examples in the book numerous ""shortcuts"" are taken with no explanation. There will be one part of an equation and then in the next step it's completely different. Only through my tutor did I learn the steps that were taken (such as trigonometric identities) to get to the next equation. Don't expect this to teach you anything unless you have a firm grasp on calculus and high level math."
1,Too complicated for no reason,"This book is too complicated for absolutely no reason. The author assumes every reader has a PhD in Mathematics. I work in the satellite broadcast industry and have this book in addition to ""Principles of Communications Satellites"" by Gary D. Gordon and Walter L. Morgan. If you are interested in learning about the satellite industry, dabbling with actual link budgets with formulas and examples that you can enter on your computer immediately to create an up/down link budget (via Excel), then do yourself a favor and buy the book I endorse above, you will be much happier."
1,bad ignition - common problem?,"Ignition component failed after third use...appears to be a common problem. Plus, watch out- it may cost a ""restock"" fee for return. Pick another product."
5,Awesome,"I love this cd it is awesome. I listen to it alot, I suggest you buy this cd and see how good it is!"
2,"Good For Relaxing, But Not His Best Work","The fact that Euge wanted to use equipment no later than 1976 did facinate me. However, even with the great collaborators he worked with, this was not Euge's best work, I'd expected way more effort than his previous albums. The only song I liked in the album was ""Chillaxin."" Other than that nothing else caught my attention.My biggest problem are the interludes in the CD's. While some CD's include just one interlude, there is no reason valuable space on a CD shouldn't be wasted on 3 INTERLUDES!!! To me, that's laziness not creativity. Because of these interludes, this CD is one of the shortest playing CD's I have.Other than that, this CD is good on a slow relaxing day if you don't mind changing CDs in a short time. I'd rather keep listening to his Livin Large CD."
5,Another flawless release,"In my opinion, Euge has a way of grabbing you through his music. He can do anything: he can relax you, excite you, dance with you, talk to you, all through the songs on his CD's. I cannot find, on this or any release he's had since his 2000 self titled CD, one track that I don't like. On this CD, Chillaxin', 12:08 AM, and Just My Imagination are the three standouts for me. Cantstopdafunk is a little ""out there"" for my tastes, but I like it. Just Feels Right and Get Em' Going are very nice tracks. I just can't find a single dud on this CD.As with every other release he's had, I'd suggest that you definitely get it. I would also recommend that you see him in concert. He's great,and after all this time, unequivocally, STILL my favorite jazz artist."
5,Just Feels Right,"I am really enjoying this cd especially the song Just Feels Right. It can pick up your spirit and get your day started on a happy mood. The other songs are very good, well worth the money for the cd."
4,Dry Martini,Euge Groove is one of the great Smooth Jazz artists. Most of Euge Groove's CDs are great so you can't go wrong with any of them. Two songs stand out: Get Em Goin and Chillaxin. Good driving songs -- peppy and interesting.
4,One of his best,"If you are a fan of Tower of Power, and loved their sax melodies, then you will love Euge Groove. He has toned down most of his songs for smooth jazz, but a few still remind one of his days with tower of power. I wanted to fill out my collection of his albums so I purchased two of his previous albums."
1,Disappointing!,"I listened to this record really hoping for something that lived up to how Euge describes the effort in his notes. Unfortunately, it sounds just like lots of other smooth jazz sax records and does not distinguish itself in any way. If this is supposed to be innovative, then I'm not hearing it. Instead, this CD predictably follows the Boney James and Dave Koz formula- and I don't need to own more of the same. Don't bother."
3,Great for big layouts - Overkill for small ones,"This book covers everything you need to know about building large scale model railroad benchwork. If you're looking for information on building a basic 4' X 8' bench, there are about 3 pages of information that cover this. If you never plan to get much bigger than 4' X 8', this rest if the information in this book is interesting, however, you may be better served, initially, by a different book."
5,The benchwork bible,"Dont be put off if like myself, your from the UK and this is an American book about railroad benchwork. All applys no matter where or what you model. It has all you ever wanted to know about building a very good base for a model railway. Ive seen some books on the subject over the years but this is the best ive seen and has proven to be a very valuable tool in my 'new build'. It will show a few tricks to even the more experianced builders. Good step by step instructions and many pictures and diagrams.Get it, you'l wonder how you got by without it."
4,Back to basics,"Great book to build layouts of all sorts. If just starting to build a layout, start with the 1st edition or something similar first. This book is an advanced version. Still, the plans or ideas will definitly give you insight for any upcoming or future product."
4,dogman,Should be a great book for a little more advanced player. I think a dvd would be a lot more helpful toa beginner
4,"Great book, but not how-to","This book is ok... but you will purchase it with ""Foggy mountain banjo"" CD to have some samples. The CD included show some techniques to improve the right and left-hand rolls and tips, and some licks, but that's not a how-to-play earl scruggs songs. Tablatures are right, and the history of bluegrass banjo and scruggs' biography is superb.This is a good book to get a solid right-hand, learning all the rolls and pattens used in Earl's songs, but remember to get a CD with the songs listed in tablatures."
2,no cd,well i ordered this from amazon thinking that it camewith the cd what a waste would not have ordered it with outthe cd
3,Not for beginners,"It's a solid book, but often criticized because the tablatures are just dictation of Earl's performances, which are very complex. When I first bought this book, I was a beginner. I had to put it down and come back to it 2 years later when I was finally ready to learn Foggy Mountain Breakdown. If you're just starting out, I'd strongly recommend Geoff Hohwald's Banjo Primer book/DVD. Then work your way up to the Earl Scruggs book."
1,This is NOT the book with the CD,"Just a note: Don't make the same mistake I did.This is not the version with the included CD, as one of the other reviewers mentioned. That is a different edition which says ""CD"", surprisingly enough, on the cover in the upper left hand corner. The cd is one of the most valuable things that comes with this book, and it's pretty useless without it.Pat"
2,Good book no CD,"I have had the original of this book for many years and only purchased it to get the CD that is in the revised edition. However, 2 books later,I have not yet recieved one with the CD. Does it exist?"
3,mixed bag,"some interesting perspectives on art and society, eloquently expressed. But too much about himself -- similar to how Thomas Friedman gets in his own way sometimes, only worse."
4,Intriguing and long at the same time.,"Dave Hickey's writing is saturated with culture, description, and intriguing ideas. In this book, he tries to make a stand on his beliefs, his personal history, and his cultural experiences. His 23 love songs are his passionate ideas on diverse subjects in his personal history. He has many beautiful and intriguing ideas that linger causing you to think deeply about life. However, the book is a bit long winded and reminiscent of a tangent, which I think to some extent was his purpose. And occasionally the book is a bit hard to follow, making it confusing. Overall, very engaging and interesting. It has a feel similar to sitting down and having random conversations with Dave Hickey about anything and everything."
5,Air Guitar-Dave Hickey,"As an art student I was instructed to read this book. At first Hickey's tone was troublesome and posed much trouble to me, yet once my epiphony came to life not only did my artwork take aon a whole new, more realized meaning, the once tunneled vision of the world that I had, expanded. If you are to do nothing, do it better than anyone else. To Artists-A MUST, To persons interested in expanding-A MUST, To everyone else-A MUST"
2,Air>>>>>>>D.Hickey,"Nowhere near what I expected. Soft, not amusing. A hard, somewhat boring read. Content is about a 1 1/2 out of 10 (ten) on an interest scale.Save Your Money."
3,A student's view...,"I had to buy this book for a class. I happen to disagree with a lot of what he says, but nonetheless it's a pretty good book. It really makes you think about things, especially the things you think you can't live without, and also those things you define your quality of life by."
2,BORING !,I had to read this book for one of my college classes and it was terrible. The book is filled with words found only in an unabridged dictionary! The book really has no substances; the book is just about some guy how is an art reviewer and has a bunch of stupid jobs in his life. Its not even interesting it's just a pain in the butt to read and did nothing for me. It was just a boring read.
1,very bad movie,"i went two my local libary and this sitting four rent.Ichecked out the movie and decided two watch it. What a waste of time. It takes a long time two findthe plot it is slow paces and very boreing. The acting is very very bad and the whole movie is a waste of time, i watched it four free andfelt ripped off.Two pay four this movie would be a sin"
5,Amazing,A movie about believing and not giving up...it was nice to see a movie with values and showing young people it is ok to have normal feelings...
4,A Different Perspective,"I view this book differently from the other reviewer. What I get from reading this book is not an abbreviated version of the Selu and Kanati tale, but a portion of it. Being a children's picture book, therefore, not very long or complex, the author has chosen to relate only part of the whole story. I don't see it as a misrepresentation, but a segment. And that segment, while reminding some readers of the Adam and Eve story, reminded me more of the Pandora's Box myth, when all the world's evils were let out of the box.Meanwhile, the artwork is superb and contributes quite effectively to an enjoyable experience. I would buy this book, knowing it isn't a scholarly treatise and was not written as such."
2,Product Pictue and Descri[tion dont match what you get,"The picture shows a blue guard under the hammer's head.The description says ""-w/Handle Guard.-With cushion grip.-""But all I got was a hammer with a hickory handle and without the guard. The polymer guard is supposed to protect the hickory wood in case some debris hits the handle instead of the metal head.I had sent it back to Amazon but the replacement which I received was missing the guard too. Both hammers had the right article number printed on them. So either its an old model or a new and ""improved"" version, or people remove the guards before they send them back to Amazon and then Amazon resells them without checking if the product is 100% fine.Since I have to start my destructive work soon I would not send it back a second time. I will attempt to protect the handle myself by wrapping some rope around it or fix a piece of plastic pipe wit some duct ape."
1,Great Band - Horrible CD,I don't have much to say. This is one of the best vocal bands I've ever heard. Their first CD is incredible! What persuaded them to make this piece of pap I'll never know. A real stinker.
3,Mediocre Product At Best,It does it's job in drying pimples and minimizing them but did not provide adequate results on my skin. I would probably not purchase this product again because it does not meet my needs but depending on your skin type (I have oily) I might just give it a try.
4,Works ...... at least mostly,"I've used this product for years. Whenever I see a pimple rearing its ugly head, I apply the gel on it. It usually gradually shrinks the pimple then makes it disappear (in 2 or 3 days), sometimes it just shrinks it.. and sometimes it doesn't do anything at all. After getting a couple of pimples that simply REFUSED to disappear after 5-7 days of applying the product, I decided to try out another product (Neutrogena on the spot treatment), I have yet to see if it will work. All in all, this thing definitely works most of the time. Though its transparent, people can see a ""shine"" coming from where it is applied. Be warned that it always leaves skin flaky where you applied it."
1,No Help at All,"Disappointing.I purchased this product in the hopes that it would reduce the daily increasing amount of acne appearing on my face and chest, but three weeks of use has yielded absolutely NO improvement.I have applied it morning and night, following the directions and rubbing a thin-ish layer on my moderate-to-severe breakouts. And with each morning inspection in the mirror comes frustration, for my acne simply will not go away.I do not recommend this product."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I used this stuff on a big red pimple near my jaw 2 years ago. After several days of applying Clean & Clear the pimple just wouldn't go away. In fact not only did it not go away it made the pimple worse. It just turned into this dark purplish mushy spot after a while. I couldn't even bring it to a head at least. After many weeks the mushy part subsided but I was left with this big dark spot that stayed on my face for MONTHS. I had to always cover it up. Even after a couple of years I still have a light scar from it.Anyway, that was just my experience. I am sure it probably does work for some people though that's why I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1. There are better products out there that I have used, but if you decide to buy this product I'd recommend trying it first in a hidden area to see how it reacts with your skin before using it on your face.About me:Fair to medium complextion.Somewhat oily skin.I am from the mediterranean."
3,Does not help with stress acne,"I've realize that when I'm very stressed, I get pimples around my forehead area and sometimes an odd one here or there on the side of my face. I purchased this after doing some research and hoped that an on-the-spot treatment of salicylic acid would help. Unfortunately, it only dries out the pimple and makes it look redder AKA more visible and worst than before!I'm really unhappy with this product, however I think it does help with pimples on the other parts of my face that may arise due to hormones or oily/combination skin and not stress. Those pimples eventually go away a few days after using this product."
1,Works for sh*!,I felt a small zit coming on 4 days ago - a little sore and a teeny bump. Put this stuff on 2 times a day for 3 days and guess what!!?? Now I have a full fledged zit. You'd be better off leaving it alone. This stuff really is sh*! - DO NOT BUY!!!
1,STINKS!!!!,"I got this stuff to try, and while it works at first within a week it doesn't, I know have even more zits than I did. So not cool."
4,It works pretty well!!,"It certainly doesn't make your spots of acne any worse, just be careful with dry skin!"
3,Work wonder,I buy this for someone else. I didn't use it myself. This item is not my brand to use. My sistr said it work much better on her clear skin. It take her awhile to get use to new product. Her skin become clear in 2 weeks.
5,It does what it advertises,"This acne treatment really works. If you feel like you've got a pimple rising, put some of this on the spot overnight and it will be much smaller in the morning, if not entirely gone. I think this has the best scent of all the acne gels I've tried. Also, pimples suck! Get rid of 'em :)"
1,Doesn't live up to its claims,"I usually get a few of those big, red pimples around my period or when I'm super stressed out, and I decided to try this out. It did absolutely nothing but make my skin burn for a few seconds, and the skin around the pimples got dry and flaky. I have had a pimple on my chin for a week and have been using this product as recommended - clearly, the pimple is just doing this own thing and I am rubbing clear...stuff...on it just for kicks."
3,Not as powerful as you'd probably like,"This stuff does an okay job of clearing up your skin but it takes a few days. It's not a one-time-use miracle cream. (see: Benzoyl Peroxide) and it smells AWFUL. I get self conscious whenever I wear the stuff because I'm afraid someone might be able to smell it on me, that's how bad it is.I'd say this is good for if you're skin is starting to flare up and you're going to be spending the day at home and want to treat it."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I tried this spot treatment for four months. I applied this salicylic acid treatment almost nightly to any acne blemishes. It burns pretty bad but, beyond that, I don't think it works. I ran out of this stuff a few weeks ago and my skin looks the same, if not a little better. I should mention that I may be finally adjusting to the ortho-tri-cyclen that I was prescribed to help with my moderate acne but, all I know is my skin didn't seem to improve at all with the use of this product."
3,didn't do anything,"it says that most people see results in 8 hours, try two days, i got no results. i say be cautious when taking this product and dont waste your money."
3,Okay-to-use!,"Its an okay to use product. I won't say that it made my pimples go away over night because honestly it didn't. But it reduced the redness and pain I was having. Made my skin extremely dry that literally when I washed off my face, skin of the infected area was coming off. I think the company should be more specific that what kind of acne does it work on. Definitely NOT for cyst acne!"
5,A comprehensive and beautifully illustrated compendium,I have only dipped into this comprehensive new publication but am pleased to have done so. It will become a valued volume in my library.
4,Some interesting highlights!,"While the audio quality is erratic (obviously these are not all studio recordings), there are some great memorable songs from the Asbury Park music scene on this CD. A crosscut view of semi-knowns and unknowns of the golden age surrounding the glory days of the Stone Pony in the 1970's and 1980's are represented for historical posterity. My favorites are Norman Seldin, Cats On A Smooth Surface, Glen Burtnick, The Acme Boogie Company, and Billy Hector."
5,Amazing Album,"This is by far the best punk album this year. I loved Miss Fortune, but this blows it away. Amazing!"
5,Very Awsome!,"I think this is one of my favorite albums ever... I can listen to every track...Well Almost every track. My favorite is California Girl. Just checked out the new video with Ali Landry... Now I gotta say, Im jelous. What I would do to look like that! LoL. It kind of reminds me of Blink 182 but better. I also think one of the guys cute are cute.. But I wont tell. I cant wait to see them on tour! Lucky 7 Rocks!"
3,Good Punk CD,"A good punk CD from start to finish. There are no poor tracks on the album, but nothing really jumps out at you either.// standout tracks //[02] where are you?[03] falling asleep[08] california girl[10] crash and burn[11] runaway"
3,Wish the lights were brighter,"The came in as I ordered, and very quickly. BUT for the price, it should put out more light. The plus..... They look great."
5,Video Sample from the DVD,Length:: 3:16 MinsHere is a sample video which is one of the 12 videos on this DVD. Hopefully it gives you an idea of what to expect.
4,A Great Little Camera,"I have been getting excellent results with this little beauty. I don't understand the comment on battery life, since I am getting 200-250 pictures on a charge. My only complaint is the size of the XD card that they supply with the unit. For a 6 Megapixel camera, you would think they would give you more storage to start with than 32MB. other than that the quality is excellent, pictures are high resolution and the Camedia software supplied with the camera does an excellent job."
2,Strange Photo Colors,"The colors are strange. I have other digital cameras, including another Olympus and they take excellent pictures. But the C60 colors seem to be overenhanced. I tried various settings, etc and nothing made a difference. The other thing I don't like is it takes a special battery pack. The other cameras take NiMh AA batteries and I've got a bunch of those so I can carry a lot of spares. If I kept the C-60, I'd have to buy 1/2 dozen spare batteries. But I'm returning it because of the odd photo coloration. If it wasn't for that, this could have been a great camera."
3,wonderful,"Thank you for your prompt service and the accurate description of the goods sold. I am very satisfied with what I got from you! Much better value, speed ... that if I had sent my old camera to Olympus for repair!"
2,Disappointed,"My initial oppinion was good but as I used the camera I realized that it did not funciton well, as it it takes a long time to become ready for use (warm up???). Also the order did not come woth A/V cable (merchant sent a memory card instead). However, now I have a battery charger that doesn't work. should have known...price too good to be true...you get what you pay for!!!"
4,Good camera,I have this camera for 2 months.Good quality photos. Easy to use.No digital zoom in auto mode.I can't buy extra battery LI-12B
1,"How to be Twit in Software ""Engineering""","This book is a great evidence of the infiltration of computer science by ""consultants."" I don't know that the author necessarily lacks any hard skills, but the book gave me that impression. This book is just a compilation of meandering buzzword babble that makes no point and warrants no confidence. The topic is project management with lots of IT-ish buzzwords thrown around. Do not expect to learn anything reasonably classified as ""engineering."" For the reader who is currently peddling management fads and looking to bother people who make software, then this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who programs or is learning to program and wants to know more about the process of creating really great software, then stay as far away from this book as you can get. Every second spent reading this is a second of life that would've been better spent napping."
3,Boring book on a somewhat boring topic,"I needed to purchase this book for a course I was taking in school.The book had some good information in it, but it was pretty bad overall. The reason I give it an OK review is because I've never really looked at other software engineering books, so I assume it's probably on pace with all of them."
1,"Pressman, you are not helping me","This book will bring you up to speed on all the buzz words for all the methodologies, but thats the extent of the book.This book covers very little of actually process, how to analyze and existing process, how to setup a new process or improve a process. It actually does a very poor job of explaining what sofrware engineering is all about and leaves you feeling that is about writing documents, not about creating reliable, verifiable software."
2,"Good information, presented poorly","This book has a ton of information, but the writing is so drab and repetitive that it's painful to read. I really wish that I didn't have to read this book for class, but what I'm doing is reading the main ideas from Wikipedia and the IBM UML series then going through the book and reading, because the book doesn't give a very good basis for a lot of their explanations."
1,This book sucks,"This book is a waste of money. I still can't understand why universities use this book as recommended text for software engineering eventhough there are great books with great examples and precise explanation about this subject.There is no real code in this book!, I really hate it"
4,The Good And The Bad,"This book is great for learning about different types of tests and models in the software engineering world. I do find the book too wordy in some parts though. Some of the sentences said are not necessary because they are common sense. Overall though, if you are not looking for a book dedicated to programming and looking for a book about practices in the computer industry then I would recommend this book."
4,Bird's Eye View,"The sixth edition is better organised that earlier editions. Its coverage is broad though not deep. For example the chapter on Agile methods gives a brief description of the different flavours, including their strengths and weaknesses and summarises what Agile methods have in common. It is targeted at a manager/team leader whose responsibilities do not normally include cutting code. Also it is geared towards enterprise architecture as the `Safe Home' running example amply demonstrates. So if you are writing parsers or numerical applications this is not meant for you."
1,Horrible!,I wanted read this with my iPad. I paid almost $100 and I can't read this with iPad! Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.
1,Unbearable,"This book is unreadable. I'm just three chapters in, and I can't bear the thought of having to read more. Nearly every paragraph is inflated with buzzwords, obscure new phases and acronyms. The author drones on and on about archaic software models when a simple table and summary of each would suffice. Pressman writes almost as if he is trying to fill a word quota.Before reading this book, I believed software engineering was dead. And after reading some of this book, I now know why: Software Engineering == Software Bureaucracy.Potential buyers of this book might want to read the article ""Software Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?"" by Tom DeMarco."
2,Minimally written,"I had no previous experience with strokes and in trying to get some perspective on what I would be dealing with after my mother's stroke, I found this book lacking. It touched on a lot of information in a minimal way, leaving me with more questions than answers. I was relieved to find other books with more comprehensive information."
5,Replens,"First of all this is not a lubricant, but a moisturizer, and so it is not ""slippery."" As a moisturizer on days that you aren't planning on a romp in bed, this is a wonderful product which helps keep the internal skin from drying out. Those of you who are past menopause or who have had hysterectomys should appreciate this. I have personally found that I like the reusable/refillable style the best bacause I can adjust the amount to my needs, which is considerably less than what they put into the prefilled applicators. I have also found that if I use a little less of the product, but use it a little more frequently (like 3 times a week), and use it right before I go to bed (to sleep!), that I'm not as bothered with any discharge. In my opinion, as a hormone-free moisturizer, this is the best."
2,Did they change the formula?,"I originally wrote a review endorsing this product, but the stuff I ordered from Amazon was NOT GOOD. It used to be the only lubricant that worked, but this batch (and I bought 6 boxes!!!) doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money."
2,Like having a feta cheese yeast infection,The directions say that with use there may be a discharge. Boy they were not kidding. I got this product so I could return to pleasant intercourse but with all the white chunks I couldn't bear the thought. I'll risk the side effects of the bio-identical estrogen gel instead.
5,Excellent Book about the authority of the Name of Jesus,"Clearly explains, using many biblical references, the authority in the the Name of Jesus - something the church dearly needs to start using more and more often when confronting sickness and demonic activity. Read this book and learn about the authority God has entrusted to the believer."
2,dougv,"I look hard for books on the names of Jesus and God the Father. Every name of Jesus, such as Commander-in-chief, Shepherd, Lamb of God, etc., are areas where He can and will help us if we ask Him to.This book is disappointing. It contains a list of statements on the name of Jesus, but I don't sense at all God's anointingon them. I don't see any real revelation of the beauty and power of Jesus' name. His name is above every name, which includes personal problems, disease and any concern you may have.The author's statements are mostly matter of fact and almost secular.I don't recommend buying this book."
4,"Pure, unadulterated Gillan at the top of his game",This album is one of Ian Gillans greatest releases since Deep Purple and Jesus Christ Superstar!
3,Girls,At first I was totally into it but after a while the book got boring and dull. I totally didnt finish the book maybe one day I will!
2,not worth the time,Plenty of stuff i already knew about girls. Lots better books out there which deal more with how the parent needs to act and treat the child in order to nuture growth.
1,"Rambling, boring, and scientifically annoying","I am simply bewildered at the rave reviews this book has received. Perhaps Dr. Deak is a better speaker than writer, but I have found little useful in this book, and (as a biologist) am frankly annoyed at her ignorance about hormones, dendrites, and even attachment theory. It's just a rambling string of stories from her own childhood and experience as a school counselor, without any original insight for handling my daughters. It also really bugs me how she under-rates girls' math and physics abilities, saying ""girls tend to like arithmetic more than mathematics""--whatever that means. I'll confess I'm only halfway through, but don't think I can stomach any more of the stereotyping, pointless anecdotes, and obvious parenting tips."
2,Not what I expected,"Not exactly what I expected. I was looking for something targeted to younger age (5-teens) to start with, and something with more practical advice on how to deal with certain stages and issues. This books deals with older gils and it is written in the language that is hard to read."
1,"Purchased this ink from RSs and was charged but it never arrived,","Sent emails to RSs and no response, Very poor customer service. took days to ship then it was sent to Georgia and I Live in California and still no comment from vendor about how or why or anything about making my order correct."
3,Where is the information?,Strange that this item has NO information about the actual toy. Nice sizing of the box but NOTHING on the Bop Bag itself. Would someone fix this?
1,Bag leaks,"My 4 year old son played with this toy for about 10 minutes before the bag got a whole in the bottom and it started leaking. The bag is not durable at all. My son was not even being rough, just a few punches and all of a sudden the bottom ripped. Don't waste your money. The problem is I have yet to find a punching bag that is durable."
2,Too old!,"Appel discusses a number of disjointed trading methods in this book, finally progressing to an exposition of the first version of his Time-Trend (T-T) trading method. This T-T method is momentum-based and has some useful filters incorporated in its methodology. However, it must be emphasized that this is an ""expert"" system which requires subjective interpretation on the part of its operator. If one is capable of making such trading decisions, then he or she does not need this book.If you are not a collector of 15 year-old trading books or outdated systems, look elsewhere!"
4,"Old, but still fun","I got this game along with some friends, and then played online multiplayer. I'm not normally an RTS fan, but I found this game fun, at least with friends. It's old, and friendly on the hardware, but is still entertaining. The basic premise of each match is to progress from the Stone Age to modern times and beyond. The progression keeps things interesting in multiplayer, and in singleplayer, the game introduces enough variations on this formula to keep things from getting too repetitive. I don't play many real-time strategy games, but this one is easy to get into without limiting more experienced players.If you are looking for a fun distraction, pick this up. It's only $10."
3,It's ok..,Released date was in 2006 and I was expecting a little more. For a $10 game it is ok. Gameplay is a little awkward. It's like playing a classic board game with some modern affects and modern stategy. I think they could have been a little more creative. There's 2 main modes. The first mode is like risk where you are in map mode. The second mode is where you control the battle front. If the maps were larger and the gameplay a little better the game would have potential.
5,Best Game,"I love this game so much. I had my hopes up on 2-day shipping from amazon, but it didn't arrive on time. But the game is really fun and I dont think it will ever die down completly. It's a combination of stragety and acton. It can be different everytime you play. Hope you enjoy the game as much as me!"
3,Um... Border line,"First off, the series was alright. The CD is small but IT CAN STILL FIT INTO YOUR BASIC CD PLAYER! Second off the singers are really cheesy. There are no girls singing what-so-ever. The best vocalist for Japan in my opinion are the girls. Third off, the non vocal tracks are great. Overall I have nothing else to say and I give this CD a 3."
2,Problems with this book,"I am one of few unfortunate persons who are not the students at Baruch College and but bought the book. The book is badly written and has a lot of mistakes. The asertion that you don't need prior programming experience to read this book is absurd! You need to know at least one high or middle level language, perferably in C++ to read this book. The reason I bought this book (can I get a refund?) is that I was attracted to by the book title. I give this book a reluctant 2 star! I don't beleve author has any formal training in computer science, it is extremely unlikely that she have a Ph.D. in computer science or enigneering even though she teaches in a college."
2,Not for newbies though an interesting read,Not a terrible book but my opinion is it is not for beginning programmers. I found this edition in a bargain bin and chose it for its focus on modeling of finance-associated object types and transactions. It has some detailed examples that are interesting and helpful. Some programming concepts do appear confused or in error but they are not difficult to discern. Will be useful for intermediate programmers. A CD with example source code would be helpful. Developing the book to suit the needs of a professional audience may be another idea. The cartoons are inconsequential and a waste of space. The diagrams are helpful. Would not recommend this as a self-study text to inexperienced programmers unless more comprehensive and accurate main text is utilized. Taken the way it as an introductory text it has a severe shortage of examples.
1,Gosh darn horrendous,i got assigned this book for a second level programming class. Its awful and confusing and at times bewildering. Most of the class is complaining abou t it right now and we will probably switch to a different text. If we don't I will probably drop the god forsaken course.
1,terrible,"I got this to get a feel of business related programming. I read through three chapters, chapters that I understood beforehand and it made me confused about what I knew if you know what I mean. The material is mashed together. Its hard at times to understand what the author is trying to say and at times it seem she does not know what is going on. I would say try another book although theres not much out there on this topic I think I did return the book though."
4,Very Good Introductory Book for C++ programmers,"This is the book I used to learn C++. I found this book extremely usefull. It gives you a very good understanding of the basics of Object Oriented Programming before going on to explaining how to write code. Can seem a little bit intimidating for the first time reader, but as you progress through the chapters things fall in place. I would have given it 5 stars in not for a couple of typos which need correction. Over all I would say it is an excellent book to start you on a journey into the great world of C++ programmingTini Korah Programmer/Analyst Goldman Sachs"
5,Its a good replacement,It fits like a glove and so far I don't have a problem with it.What I liked was it came in as pre-oiled and inside a closed bag to stay clean.The rubber fitting was a little bent when I got it but it posed no threat to my installation.
3,Detailed but kind of boring,"If you are looking for a book that is specifically about the ""men in black"" phenomena, I would suggest not purchasing this. The author goes on and on about specific government agencies that did surveillance on many UFO researchers but fails to connect many of them to MIB or is meeley suggesting that agencies like the CIA and FBI are the MIB. It's probably my fault for not researching the book fully or just reading the title...haha... before purchasing, but I found it ultimately disappointing. This is based solely on the fact that I wanted to learn more about the otherworldly theories about MIB and not how government agencies spied on UFO researchers. Unless you have been living in a cave for your entire life, you already know that the government keeps tabs on anything dealing with national security including UFO's! If this is the topic you wish to learn more about then this book does a good job."
5,Good read,"Redfern, you are quite the researcher. I think in twenty years UFOlogists will be quoting Nick Redfern on the internet and harping back to the good old days when researchers like him were doing the best work. This was a very interesting read.Jess"
5,One of the funniest comedy ever,"When I was in college, we had a guy that would bring tapes up... We will listen over and over...This is adult humor... But I would rank in my top 5, with Bill Hicks being #1...It a good slice of his humor, unforuately there isn't more available..."
4,I Finally Broke Down,"I have been wanting to order this for a while, and they tempted me with a low price. :)..It's a very nicely restore version, and have enjoyed being able to watch them whenever I feel like it."
3,Sound issues,"Well, I am enjoying this series except that somehow in the mastering of this they have managed to screw the sound up... sometimes loud, sometimes so soft it is ridiculous. Sometimes my tv is on 24 for the sound and the voices are fine but the music is loud, other times I turn the sound up to 44 just to barely hear the people speaking.That sucks."
3,Great for old sci fi buffs!,"All in all a pretty good show, if you like the 70's version of scifi. The show only has two seasons, the second season with a slightly different cast. The writing is better in the first season, and there a problem with the sound. When the music plays it is a bit loud. It is about as loud as when a commercial comes on when you are watching regular TV (other wise I might have scored it a higher rating). But all in all a good show."
5,Series to fire up the imagination.,"Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were responsible for stirring up and building my passion for space related science fiction when I was growing up in Uganda back in the 1960's. Series such as Fireball XL5, Thunder-birds, Captain Scarlett, Space 1999 etc. were and continue to be wonderful to watch. I fell in love with this series back in England in the 70's. Yes it looks dated by today's standards but the story lines and wonderful dressing and quirky acting make this a hugely enjoyable series to watch. I would have loved to have been stationed on the moon with Gabrielle Drake. Mamma Mia!"
3,UFO,"I should have checked all the DVDs before I started viewing them as I found the next to last one cracked. Other than that they were in fine shape and viewed very good. I have no way to prove that I didn't break it taking it out, but it was broken when I first opened the case. Gary A Pew"
3,A Real Hoot,"Fans of the Andersons will enjoy this collection. I remember it in black and white. In color it's even funnier (purple wigs on Moon Station for the girls, not the men). It is Thunderbirds without any strings, the acting very similar to our marionette budies. But it was 1969, before any real computer special effects. Taking that into account, it's not a bad piece of sci-fi TV history."
5,Good Ol' Sci-Fi!,"Great picture on my 42 inch flat screen! Looks like it was filmed yesterday! Very dated, but that is what makes it so much fun. This is truly a valued addition to my DVD library. What a hoot!"
3,A Great Vision ... A Nice Premise,"No regrets about this purchase. However, it has a large ""cheese factor."" I happen to LOVE sci-fi cheese. I remember, as a kid, all the cool hardware these Brits would throw against alien invasions -- not to mention the cool chicks who work in close quarters on Moon Base Alpha, at HQ, and down on the submarines. Goodness. Great retro television viewage. The plots aren't Star Trek worthy, but more than a few involve a nice look at the humans who work so hard to keep Earth safe and add some nifty commentary on what it means to want to remain unique and unconquered in this universe. Hmmm."
2,cave emptor,"I purchased this mega-set with great anticipation. however, it falls short of satisfactory for two reasons: 1) the video portion does not run smoothly- it is staggered 2) the audio portion is also staggered and broken. Unfortunately, I cannot exchange the item but I must return it for reimbursement and then order it again- very inconvenient."
3,was the ITC spinning diamonds intro included in each episode,"Before I purchase, I would like to know if the ITC spinning diamonds intro and the 'century 21/ Anderson' intro that immediately followed were retained in the DVD of each episode. Quite thrilling. Hopefully they were smart enough to have retained them because that alone would make the purchase worth while."
1,Not a Pretty Picture,"Like many, I bought the eponymous album for ""Kiss Me"". That album was very different to the taster track, yet well worth coming back to.This, on the other hand, is dreadful. There are a few good songs in there, but in the context of the others there it is just tiring to listen to virtually anything. The recordings are not top notch, and the sound quality varies noticably between tracks. This is what mastering houses were made for.Nothing sounds like ""Kiss Me"", and nothing matches the quality of the album it comes from.Highlight: ""Love Salvation and the Fear of Death (REMIX)""Lowlight: The AlbumDISSAPPOINTING. AVOID."
1,Not For Me,This collection does not appeal to me. I don't like the shrill shrieking on some of the tunes. This is just not for me.
1,"Yeah, right!","Okay, Leigh sings ""There SHE goes..."" What's up w/that? God's in Lesbianism now? I don't think so. Leigh, get out your Bible and read it."
2,Collage A Poor Sampling Of Indie Sixpence,"It is much more advisable for new Sixpence listners to buy Sixpence's first two albums, THIS BEAUTIFUL MESS and THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW than this hastily thrown together collection. Missing from this ""portrait"" are Sixpence classics like ""Trust"" and ""Meaningless,"" a song the band still plays live at epic length. The artwork is second-rate and goes against the artistic nature of a band. Avoid COLLAGE unless you just can't afford both of Sixpence's early CD's. One positive thing I will mention about COLLAGE is that whoever selected the tracks for the album (and it was not the band) had the forsight to pick the best songs from the TICKETS FOR A PRAYER WHEEL EP It is still unforgivable that the same care was not taken in selecting LP tracks. It sounds as if the compilers of the album tried to find as many ""Kiss Me"" clones as they could in Sixpence's back catalog."
4,To Betsy from kentucky,"Betsy from kentucky, get over it. It's called a ""cover song."" And its not necessarily a love song. Judge not, lest ye be judged."
4,For Old Fogies Like Me,"A good family entertainer from an era gone by. Stewart Granger has stunts and sword fights galore, with a sweet but devious love interest, starting with dislike of each other to their appreciating each others values and falling in love.One to enjoy for one like me, otherwise out of date for the in generation."
3,Not his best.,"Steward Granger was always one of my favorite actors. I enjoyed his roles in King Solomon's Mines, The Wild North, Scaramouche, The Prisoner of Zenda, Bhowani Junction, North to Alaska and others. But this wasn't one of his better movies and it may not have been his fault at all. Movie studios have been known to coerce actors into taking roles that they don't want to take. Directors have been known to royally screw up a movie. This was a B-movie: unbelievable story line, weak supporting cast, and Granger himself just looked tired and jaded. I saw on a biography webpage that he once said of himself, ""I haven't aged into a character actor. I'm still an old leading man."" I think that said it all. I just wasn't able to get through this movie. My opinion."
1,Book lies here unread (pun intended),"One need not eat the whole egg... Continuing in the tradition of the enterprising journalist who first diverted readers with the Sally Hemings saga, regurgitated here of course, yet again, this book invents more history than it explains."
1,Fiction!,"I feel certain the author of ""Duel"" is also a great supporter of Bill Clinton. This says it all about what I think of the subject matter of this book."
4,Very Detailed Telling of the Tale,"The details of the political world of Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton are both the triumph and the undoing of this book. Thomas Fleming has obivously put a lot of energy into his research, to the point where all of the politicians mentioned and the events they are related to becomes a little overwhelming. Many of these details are fascinating as well, however.The various schemes that Burr was involved with are fascinating, as is the precarious state the Union itself was in at the time. And of course the telling of the duel itself is extremely well written. The retelling of the deadly contest between Burr and Hamilton by Thomas Fleming made me sympathize with both of them.The author does a very good job at sketching both protaganists in a fair, objective light, and steers clear of demonization, especially of Burr.A great, if sometimes complicated, read."
4,much to think about here,"""Duel"" is especially rewarding for the manner in which it reminds us of the persistence of the competitive heroic code from the time of Homer's Iliad even to the present. Burr and Hamilton engaged in mortal combat because of the importance to them of ""fame"" and ""glory."" Hamilton's final, farewell letters to his wife are as touching--and tragic--as Hector's farewell to his wife Andromache in Iliad 6. The hero pleads with his wife that she would not want him to live in disgrace rather than to die gloriously. (I'm sure the wives knew better.) My only criticism has to do with the inordinate length of narrative leading up to events surrounding the duel. The book could easily have been shortened by 150 pages or so. Highly recomended."
4,America's Duel,"This is a very exciting, fast-paced narrative that details the rivalry between Hamilton and Burr for control of the Federalist Party during the early days of the American Republic.While both men shared an animosity toward President Thomas Jefferson, their rivalry for control of the Federalist Party led them to a dueling ground in New Jersey where Burr shot and killed Hamilton.I liked this, but I loved Ron Chernow'sAlexander Hamiltonand would recommend that over The Duel as a portrait of Hamilton and his times, but this is very well done book that looks at the two rivals."
3,Election,"This book is more about the gubernatorial election than the duel. Of course the election is important as context for the duel. But for my tastes the context-to-event ratio was way too high. The book should have been advertised as a book about the election, with the duel included as one of its dramatic outcomes."
4,"Excellent Follow-up Reading after ""John Adams""","David McCullough's book, John Adams, and the HBO special based upon it, sets the stage for this fascinating book. After an interest in Jefferson's administration and its role in the Lewis & Clark Corp of Discovery, my attention was drawn to ""Duel"", but somehow it seemed to be with a proper context, until McCullough's bookJohn Adamsseemed to draw the stage lighting upon the intense figures of Hamilton and Burr. The book is a look at their personalities, but much more it shows the continued fractious nature of the young Republic after the death of Adams. Simply put, if you enjoyed ""John Adams"", you are ready for ""Duel""."
3,ok,"These were cute, but I was expecting them to be a lot bigger then they were. They are very small and kind of cheap looking. Kind of expensive for what you get."
3,misleading,the goodies in side were nice but the overview of the product isnt clear. I thought i was buying a package of 8 goodie bags
5,SO CUTE!!! MY ONE YEAR OLD SON LOVED IT!!!,"For my son't first birthday we decied to do a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse theme for his party because he absolutely loves Mickey. When I saw this pinata I thought it would look so good with all of the other Mickey decor and sure enough, it did!!! It's a nice size and I am so happy that I ordered this product!!"
4,Was perfect for us.,Although it is not one you can take a bat to (always fun) this still works really well and no one gets hit instead of the Pinata.Everyone loved it and it held plenty of candy.The only thing that is a bit negative is that it was a little too durable. I had to pull at the bottom even after it was open.I think most of them are like that though.I also was able to take the picture off and put it on my son's wall for decoration after we were done with it.Good purchase.
4,My boyfriend loves it,"I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend (who is 22 years old) and he loved it! I was scared it was going to be too small because I assumed it was for kids but it's even a little loose on his 6'5"" frame. He's worn it every day since I gave it to him a few months ago and there is hardly any noticeable wear & tear."
5,"Excellence has a name, and that name is","If your looking for a Great Modern Rock CD look No Further!!! This CD has everything!!! Stupendous Vocal, Fabulous Music with some great guitar licks, and Mix all that together with the positive uplifting message in the Lyrics...and you have just created an excellent CD known as ""The Other Side of Fear"" by Old Man Shattered. Everyone in the household can enjoy this CD. Can't wait to hear more from these guys in the future!!! *****"
5,Excellent book,"A werry good book, excellent to have when you are restoring an classic Chevy. To have the right colors and comper with your own car."
3,"Big, Very Big","The price for this oven is very low considering the quality and features. It is basically a mini version of a high end oven. unfortunatley it is not a taster oven, too big, and cost a fortune to run if you are doing what the name suggests - making toast. So this is not your standard counter appliance"
1,"""New"" oven DOA","Great price, just what I wanted if it had worked. Supposedly new, the box was re-taped which was not a good sign. Plugged it in, no power, tried several other outlets, nothing.Amazon gets four stars for an easy return - UPS picked it up the next day. At that time, the oven was sold out, so my only choice was a refund. They lose one star for letting it get through quality control. Check the ""Used & new"" section for refurbished items from an Amazon subsidiary, curiously priced above that for a new item from Amazon. This model has obviously had problems."
2,NOT FOR TOASTING!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE FOR THE TOASTER FEATURE unless you have all the time in the world! Every time you want to toast, the oven heats up first even if you just toasted something. It took 10 minutes to toast 4 english muffin halves which came out too light the first time around! The instruction booklet is very basic. It does not contain a conversion table to use the convection oven feature.This toaster oven is also being marketed by Oster and Europro."
2,"lackluster performance, but pretty","This item had obviously been sold before and returned. It came with a note from preveious purchases complaining it was too big - but no instruction book. I made a casserole dish of roasted vegetables that ordinarily cooks in 45 minutes, and it took the entire 45 minutes. Of course I was unable to make the oven go higher that 400 degrees f., whereas I usually cook the dish at 425, so that might have been the problem. Basically, this was a waste of money for me. My two older portable ovens are better, actually."
1,TERRIBLE,"The first time I received the item, both Start/Stop buttons don't work. The second time I received the item, convection fan failed to function. They keep sending defective ovens!! Amazon failed at returns as well!! It's been a terrible experience."
4,Great Toaster oven,"I would purchase this product over and over. Talk about durability. This toaster oven was built to last. I would definitely recommend this product. I have nothing negative to say about this product. In fact, when I first received the oven it was damaged. The customer service handled the replacement without any issues at all."
3,Nice but not great,While overall pleased with the product there are a couple issues. 1) A bit large - the oven itself is substantially larger than the average toaster oven. 2) While I am not 100% sure on other toaster ovens this particular model does not go above 400deg while in bake mode. 3) For toasting this model is not particularly effective as it is so large it seems to toast rather ineffectively
2,"Huge, interesting features, strange provenance - beware.","I bought this at Costco under the Oster name. Previous reviews describe it fairly: Long preheat time for toast. I always ran a toast cycle before I actually needed the toast.I found the convection cycle to work well for biscuits, etc. The large size meant you can sometimes avoid turning on your big oven.Some annoying features: When it stopped, you still had to push the 'Stop"" button. If you stopped it, you had to push it twice! The top indicator is recessed so anyone over 5'6"" had to bend over to read it.I'm using past tense, because after 4 short months, the bottom element no longer works. A little research reveals that VillaWare, Oster, andSunbeam are all part of 1 big conglomerate, and this toaster oven is not listed on any of the websites, including the VillaWare website.That would make me very wary of this purchase, even if I had not had this negative experience."
3,Buyer Be Informed,"I was surprised to find the Sanskrit portions of this dictionary written in their original alphabet. Although a must for the student or scholar of the language, this feature was of no use to me. I hope this information helps future buyers."
2,This isn't a dictionary. It's a glossary.,"A true dictionary gives a word's pronounciation, lists more than one meaning of a word, and shows various examples of how speakers may use the word in a sentence. This book doesn't.Instead, this book was intended for the author's students.It's helpful, but very pricey for what it contains."
5,Excellent movie,"No holds-barred mockumentary on geeks, dorks, jerks, and losers. Very diverse group of characters that everyone can relate to at sometime in their lifetime. It was really 2 movies in one, the frozen dinner collector's club and the foul-mouthed Christian rock band who are in it for the money and the chicks. This was the funniest move I've seen in over 3 years. I look forward to more movies from the director-writer who isn't playing by Hollywood rules."
2,Two Stars Only,"This is a DVD which is true to the name of the production name - Brown Bag Productions. It is a compilation of very short scenes of different birds at different locations some of which are OK and most are only look like ""run and gun"". It looks like to me that the filmmakers travelled to good birding locations and took some short takes of the birds they found and are now trying to make some money to pay for the trip. It is not very well done with no sound or narrative. You have to go to another track to find the names of the birds unless you make a listing of the birds for yourself before watching the DVD. I know you are supposed to be guessing what the birds are than check the answers; but, it just doesn't work for me. I won't be buying any Brown Bag Production DVD's anymore."
3,not what I expected,"If you want a video of some of the same areas of the island, but from different angles, or to fall asleep to something peaceful, this DVD is for you. I thought the scenes would be of beautiful vistas all over the island, maybe with narration, but this was not the case. There seems to have been only a few specific areas highlighted, from many different vantage points."
4,nice.,"The camera takes great pictures. The only things you should know is that the flash is a bit slow, and the slider to change modes sticks and is hard to put into the picture-taking mode. Other than that it's a good deal for your money."
2,DRAINS THE BATTERIES IN MINUTES!!!,Double A batteries doesn't hold well with this digital camera. You literally have to changed batteries every 50-70 shots. Picture quality is ok for uploading pictures on the internet.
4,Reasonable Low Cost Second Hand Purchase,"This camera is a reasonable second hand purchase with good availability on eBay. US$55 including postage with a 128 MB xD memory card in Australia.The camera is small, yet solid. The functions are easy to use for basic requirements. The more advanced requirements take a little while to get used to. The flash and the zoom work well.When purchasing second hand cameras look for one that comes with a bag, if not, the camera is likely to have been exposed to some rough treatment."
5,Great camera!,"I got this camera as a gift from a friend. As my second digital camera this guy has been working hard taking picturesPros: Small and comfy in hand, simple to use, easy to put in new batteries and memory cardsCons: Like other before me it seems to use up battery charge quickly although I have solved that problem by buying new rechargeable batteries. Shutter speed is not as fast as I would like it to be.Overall view: Great camera for a beginner!"
1,The worst experience,"I'm sorely disappointed in my purchase. I trust in amazon and I was swindled by aa-wholesale (Chaya Korn). I purchased from it an Olympus digital camera by Amazon on the 1st of June. I couldn't use the camera because the zoom was not properly working. I wrote aa-wholesale in order to see how we should handle this problem, and they wrote me that I send the camara back to them so I did it. The camera was returned by USPS on the 22nd of August. Then on the 29th of September aa-wholesale wrote me that they were shipping my camera back to me but it never arrived. I wrote a lot of e mails asking the tracking number and aa-wholesale never answer. I called to aa-wholesale and they only put excuses and never send the camera back to me. I was waitting for 6 month and I don't have answers. It was the worst experience and it was the last"
5,Great camera for the money - vibrant photographs,"I was looking for a 3 megapixel camera in the price range of $150. This camera definitely fits the bill and is totally worth it. You'll just need to invest in a good set of rechargeable batteries because standard AA's won't last long. Other than that, this little camera is impressive.The D-540 is not the most stylish-looking camera, the body is plastic, but the pictures it captures are remarkable.I recently went to Aruba and took this camera. The pictures turned out sharp and vibrant.I've had experience with Olympus and Nikon digital cameras before the D-540. I think this is one of the most encomical 3+ megapixel point-and-shoot cameras out there. I highly recommend it."
5,I'm lovin' it,"The camera has exactly what I was looking for. The image quality is very good, its easy and simple to use and a great value for the price. The night mode is excellent, but be careful not to shake when shutter is open. Tripod recommended when using in night mode. Don't worry too much about the battery life, you will be ok if you have a two pairs of rechargeable ones."
3,"Great Pics, Terrible Battery Life","1. Pictures come out VERY crisp and clear. Love them!!!2. Size is fantastic. Can put in a small purse and carry around.3. Batteries get used up at a ridiculous rate. Even after I bought rechargeable batteries with 2300 MAH, they still get used up too fast!4. Price is great.5. Very easy to transfer pictures to computer.6. Sleek look.Overall: Although I really love the output quality of my pictures, I would not buy this camera again. It is just too much worrying about when the batteries are going to die so I always have to cary 8-10 batteries JUST IN CASE!!!"
4,excellent camera for the money,I have purchased two of these cameras at seperate times as gifts because of the excellent quality and easy to use features of this model. Only one drawback i have encountered is the battery life is relatively short if using standard batteries .Owners may want to think about upgrading to rechargable lithium batteries.
4,Olympus D-540 ( aka C-310) - SUPER MACRO !,"Although I've access to assorted digital cameras,a need for super close up work in electronics had left me frustrated, since most modern units max out at a handspan (~200mm. Grr !! BUT - this new Olympus C-310 (as it's sold here in NZ) fits the budget bill well, since it goes to just 20mm (~1 inch). Yah - see sample pix (itself resized to ~100k from original 600k)=> www.picaxe.orcon.net.nz/picnksm.jpg.* Top features - supermacro, 2 AA NiMH, large LCD* Downsides - rather chunky styling, no sound with moviesOf course all the ""normal"" Olympus features & user friendly software is included. But could be worth it for budget super macro alone I'd say, espec. in electronics, micro engineering, flowers, insects, medical, jewellery etc"
4,Great camera but some problem with the battery ilfe,"I have always love Olympus image quality, the colors are great and the lcd discplay shows exactly how the picture will look like when you get it into the computer, the pictures look alive, i compared to other digital cameras such as HP, Kodak, and there is no point of comparison, Olympus Rocks!!, the only problem with this model is the battery life, i recommend that yo turn of the display, disable the flash when you dont need it and get rechargable batteries, and carry them with you every time."
4,D-540 zoom,"A x-mas present that blew me away. The camera is small and very portable. The battery problem is a concern. The low battery light came on within the first hour of using the supplied batteries. I put in new 2300mah batteries and had the same problem ,although they never actually went dead. The power-saver feature does work, despite another review I read. The xd-memory is a draw back, being new and $10-20 more than Sd media; xd is half the size of sd however.Overall, while I am pleased with the camera; a little upgrading would be worth it. The 540 takes short movie clips, but has no sound. The 560, for I believe $10.00 more, has audio."
2,My thoughts,"I think this book could have been better. It had action, but not enough romance. I will not read this book again. This is not the first book, I don't find these books interesting.Thanks,Kristie"
2,NOT what I expected,"I bought the CD, expecting it to be the GUNDAM WING CD, the music from the airings on Cartoon Network.. BOY was I wrong, so you'd expect me to not like the CD THAT much. This CD is titled ""Gundam"" but it happened to be not the one I was ordering.. The vocals and music are way too slow for my taste, and the singers really sound weak. But.. if you're the kind of person who likes slowwww music, with a BIT of loudness, then you might as well buy this. But they again, if you're like me (loudmouth and loud sound) then I wouldn't recommend this. And the CD is really, really, SMALL! I don't think it'd fit in your ordinary CD player. I hope this review has been of some help!"
1,Cheap,This hat is really cheaply made. I returned it immediately. Do yourself a favour and buy Zildjian BlackOn Black Flexfit Cap instead. More expensive but like 10 billion times better.
1,Cheap Hat,"This hat looks cool, but it's is so cheaply made I'm afraid it won't last too many wearings. I can't imagine something this poorly constructed would even be given out as a promo, let alone sold to the public. Zildjian- Great symbols, lousy hats."
1,Sucks,"OK. Why is there a picture of a Tshirt now? I ordered a hat, claimed to be ""fitted"". Turned out being a one size fits all hat with velcro adjustable strap. Hat didn't fit well. Ended up in the garbage can."
1,Disappointing personal reminiscences,"I was so disappointed with this book. Its egocentric conversational prose grated on me so much that it distracted me from its meaning. Buried deep inside the personal reminiscences is a commentary on a different rowing style but the book's preoccupation with a ""chatty"" writing style really diminished its credibility and, more importantly, failed to communicate clearly what the author was proposing."
1,Waste of time and money,"Someone earlier in these reviews called the author ""rude and self centered."" I second that. Plus he's a terrible writer with nothing interesting to say. Too bad the lowest choice is one star."
4,A brotherly perspective,"I grew up with the author and I can tell you that as he is in real life, his book is quite unique and challenging. Yes, it is a book about rowing with a very intelligent understanding of the physics of power generation (without equations!) but it is an allegory of a man who is still seeking meaning and justification despite a career and a life of coming in second more times than he would have liked. Read about rowing but ponder the complex man who has willingly tied a part of his life to the intense competition on water."
3,Very Poor Packaging / Flimsy plastic tabs to connect pieces,"The three primary pieces were challenging to fit together without breaking the tabs. Kind of made me ponder how hard is it to produce pieces of plastic which fit together. Once assembled, the tower does not fit back in the box (necessitating an alternate storage box). Indeed the packaging is bare bones.An adult needs to rotate the tower's base, as the product is too flimsy for kids to rotate it on their own (or the kids are forced to grab their own marbles after each turn so that each reservoir is shared by all players).The toy is fun but you have to be exceptionally careful when handling the product lest it break."
1,biggest piece of junk,"I would NOT buy this toy. If it was not a gift, I would return it. It is made so cheaply. There are barely enough sticks to keep the balls up. Once you put the game together, which I found hard to snap in to place, it will not fit back in to the box. So how are you going to store it with all the marbles and sticks without taking it apart? It's way too hard for a child to put back together. I am not usually so negative, but I have no idea how this product can stay on the market."
5,wart remover,I use it for healing anything having to do with the skin. Taste isn't bad either. It works great as a wart remover.
3,Eh .. I've found a better product for natural hair,"A friend was raving about this and Kimmaytube's leave-in, so I bought the gel (I previously used the juice) thinking the consistency would be thicker. Uh, I hold it for two seconds in my hands and it turns into the juice. :/I've moved on to vegetable glycerin as a humectant instead, but I'll hold onto this. Maybe I can use it in my smoothies or something."
1,beware of carrageenan,Before you buy google the side effects of carrageenan. It's associated with tumors and digestive system related cancers like colon cancer. We should not be ingesting it. Try a brand without this ingredient.
5,I have used this product for years,"I luv this product, I usually get this from Vitamin Shoppe for a about 8 dollars. I drink about 2-6 oz daily and it helps with my digestion and elimination. In addition my skin is always glowing and my gum are very pink. I notice many of the reviewers use in their hair routine, I haven't done that but I am sure with the results I get using it internally, using it externally should be wonder."
2,"NOT A GEL!! MESSY. MESSY, MESSY!!!!",I bought this product (because it was cheaper than the product that I normally use) thinking that it was a true gel. IT IS NOT!! It is only aloe juice with a gelatin thickener added to it. The consistency is part clumpy part watery mess. I bought it for my hair and it is not suitable for that use. Any TRUE aloe GEL should be suitable for use on skin or hair and this you cannot use on either without it running down you face or off your body into a puddle. NEXT TIME I will stick to the product that I normally use.Fruit of the Earth 100% Aloe Vera 12 oz. Gel
1,Item not described properly.,"I purchased this aloe gel to use as an ingredient in a topical herbal product I am making at home. The product description did not say that it needed refrigeration. The recipe I was using called for an aloe gel base, and I purchased this for that reason.I have had the product for over a month now, trying to figure out if I have another use for this much aloe. Now, I discover that Amazon will not allow me to return it - both because of the time duration, as well as the fact that it's opened (I opened it before realizing that it required refrigeration). I am very unhappy about this as it was not described appropriately, and I feel that I should be refunded for a product that I cannot use due to Amazon's negligence in description."
3,Gel or Juice?,"Primary Ingredients: Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Gel (99.5%), Carrageenan (thickening agent), Less Than 1% of the following natural, food grade sources: Citric Acid (oxidation inhibitor), Potassium Sorbate (mold inhibitor).I tried several different websites to read what the ingredients are,and should not have had to do all that.The complete listing of ingredients should be required on Amazon for a product like this,because it's all about what this kind of product is made out of,not the claims.I tried this product a long time ago,and it is meant as a medicinal beverage,not as a topical skin gel,it was just too thin for that purpose...In my opinion,this product is a juice,not a gel.As a/v [juice],LOTD a/v is true,the ingredients list is short,as it should be.Most other a/v products have a lengthy ingredients list full of lots of mystery junk."
5,Gold,"I use this in my natural hair-it tightens my curls and has helped my hair grow. I use this on my face along with green tea and apple cider vinegr as a toner my face feels wonderful its tight and bright. (I also use a baking soda scrub before and 2 dabs of jojaba oil after.)When me or my chidlren get a cut, I put some on it and it aids in healing. I want an aloe vera plant. Until then this is a lifetime keeper product. This particular brand is just aloe vera no dyes or additives like the stuff you find in walmart."
3,An outlandish cumulative tale,"""Hello, Neighbor,"" Pig says to Goat, ""Where have you been?"" ""To the bakery,"" replies Goat. ""What did you buy?"" asks Pig. ""An apple pie,"" says Goat.""Where is the Apple Pie?"" is Pig's inevitable reply, and so begins this circuitous story. The question is never answered directly, instead an outlandish cumulative tale unfolds when Goat reports that robbers took his pie.On one page, we see Goat recounting the saga of the pie. On the facing page, we see what transpires with the robbers and the pie. Kids will get a kick out of keeping track of the wayward pie and in asking, ""then what happened?""Gorbachev's illustrations tell the story even better than the text. His robbers are rapscallions, his goat is an innocent victim and his pig is a good listener. A winning combination."
3,"Good content, average quality","The content of this book is beyond reproach - good, detailed solid technical info. That's why I bought it. It's a bit beyond me as a geologist but I won't outgrow its content and that suits me fine. I was disappointed by the publication quality though. I knew it was a paperback, but it seems a particularly flimsy paperboard, and for a book of this size and density, it really needs a hardback or a stiffer, tougher paperback cover. This is a working book which might end up in a field camp, and for US$70, I would appreciate a hardback. More importantly, the text quality is poor, as are the photos. I compared it to the original (which our office has a copy of) and it seems they have scanned the original publication and digitally printed it. The text has an annoying blur, just like photocopies, and the images (never the best in the original) are furthur degraded and contrasty.A for content, C for effort. B overall."
3,Not as good as some medieval mysteries,"It's obvious to the reader that the author has probably read every other medieval mystery in existence..there are bits in here from Ellis Peters, P.C. Doherty, Bernard Knight, Michael Jecks, etc. Unfortunately, the first 3/4 of the book is standard fare that we've read before...except that it is a bit slow moving and boring here, with somewhat wooden characters. What saves this novel is the final rush to an exciting ending."
1,Wait for Warner Brothers DVD restoration in 2007!,"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs. You usually get rare obscure cartoons in presentable, if not good, condition for generally a dollar.But when it comes to Popeye, I must tell everyone that Warner Brothers is gotten the rights to restor the classic B&W; and Color theatrical Popeyes from 35mm master negatives for a 2007 release. So wait for that release.The Superman's are available elsewhere as complete sets from 35mm."
1,Ick!,"I bought this after having a tummy tuck so I could have some additional support as I healed. Unfortunately the leg openings were so tight that my thighs squished out like sausages. I was expecting the support to be in the abdomen, not the thighs!"
3,"Nice, but small.","These are very nice microwaveable containers, with steamer inserts so you can put water in the bottom and steam vegetables, fish, etc. They work great, they look great. The con for me is, they are really small, and there is only 8 oz difference in each size. Although they are 24, 32 and 40 oz dishes, that's the amount of WATER you can poor in. Not the amount of food you can actually cook. The large one MIGHT fit 2 small fish filets at most. A better way to imagine what you are going to receive when you buy these, is to get out your ruler and see how big 5"", 6"" and 7"" containers are. They are about 1 3/4"" deep. With the steamer insert, you have a little over 1"" space for your food. If you are cooking for one person, these are OK. And even then, you'll probably never use the medium or small containers."
1,boring,"If only ""complex time signatures, complex chord changes, and complex sounds"" ensured good music. They do not and this is not a good record."
2,Don't judge Kurt by this Album,In my opinion this is Kurt's worst album.(Sorry Kurt..) He's one of my favorite all time players but I just can't listen to this one. Its Ice cold and sounds mechanical to me. Go listen to The Next Step if you want to hear some good modern Jazz as well as a great representation of Kurt's compositions. If you want to hear him in a more traditional sense listen to Reflections or East Coast Love Affair which are brilliant. This guy is really talented and unfortunately for me this was the first CD I heard of him and I lost interest until many years later. Don't make my mistake!
5,"Brilliant, inventive, bold, unique","Kurt's work shines on ""The Enemies of Energy"". I have heard him as a sideman both live and on recordings--where his reserve is equally impressive. But this recording truly displays his unique creative process. The band members are household names by now, and deservedly so. We have a genius on our hands here; this recording is a must-have."
1,"DON""T GET THE KINDLE VERSION",I'm very disappointed solely because I chose to save a few dollars and purchase the kindle version of this title. There is no software available as promised and the text is riddled with syntax errors so it is impossible to know right code from wrong. I am now hesitant to purchase the hardcopy for fear that the same syntax errors are present. If you get the chance save your money and first go through the tutorials on the python.org website. If you are still having issues then consider purchasing this book but DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION.
5,The Mousekin series of books make for delightful reading,"My five-year-old daughter and I discovered the Mousekin series of books at our local library and loved them! They are beautifully illustrated and the stories are captivating, bringing the story of the woodland creatures to vibrant life. In ""Mousekin's Family"", young Mousekin finds a very young mouse and thinks its one of his own. The pair go off in search of a new home for the young mouseling, but it soon becomes apparent that the young mouse is not really interested in learning how to make a new home for itself, being distracted by the exciting things occurring around it. It is up to Mousekin to ensure a safe haven for the little mouse. These books about young Mousekin's adventures are worth tracking down - they will delight any young child and will enhance one's personal library."
1,"Not OEM, as pictured. This is a cheap replica","As others have noticed this is not the same one as pictured. It clearly says replica next to the part number on the back. If I wanted a replica, I can get one from ebay for $8 w/shipping. I will be returning it."
5,Great customer service,"Great customer service. I needed another part as well, emailed them and I got a call within an hour. I Will definitely use them again."
4,Nothing Wrong with Emblem but need Gromets,"The negative comment here seems like it was written by a competitor. I am an end-user. I have bought BMW parts from eLuka twice now and been very satisfied with the speed of fufillment and quality of the part. The only reason this review is not a 5 is that to replace the emblem, you should buy the grommets as well and the description doesn't make that recommendation."
1,"bad quality, missing parts, defective","I ordered 3 sets of string lights. One worked fine, though the metal frames that go inside the lanters to keep them open all the way are too large, and so the risk of tearing the lanters while installing them is really high.2 of the 3 orders did not work at all upon plugging them in. One worked after changing one of the fuses, but the other did not, even after putting in two completely new fuses. So now, I am left one set that does not work at all, and no fuses to replace the other two string light sets in case they go out.I will never buy from this merchant again."
4,A good introductory textbook,The biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life is an excellent text to provide some valuable resources for chemist.
5,Morse at his best,"Morse is at his best under three conditions: when he has a chance to utilize his education; when he becomes emotionally involved with women whose actions affect the case and when his interactions with Lewis reveal the synergy between them and the respect and affection which undergird it. In this case, Morse and Lewis are in Vicenza, Italy, investigating the death of a woman who has been participating in a self-help program run by an Englishman previously arrested by Morse. The con artist/guru is played by the superb Michael Kitchen, who attempts to outsmart and badger Morse (never a good idea). The location shots are excellent, particularly the scenes in a roman amphitheatre converted for use as an opera house. As the soprano sings and the tears moisten Morse's eyes and cheeks, we're in Morse heaven. The plot is complex, the dialogue poignant, the direction expert. Check it out."
3,A Trip to Italy,"This entry has many features going for it: beautiful scenery, opera excerpts from Rigoletto and Turandot, regional Northern Italian area atmosphere in Vicenza and Verona, customs and language of the locals, along with a very relaxed Morse and Lewis. These features provide enough color to pull the rating for this weak plot up to three stars. There are many characters, (too many?) who seem to run together making the plot difficult to follow and giving the viewer a convoluted take on the whole affair, until the last fifteen minutes when all falls into place. I was looking forward to the trip to Italy but was rather disappointed. There are few Morse cases that do not come up to par, unfortunately this is one of them."
3,Disappointing,Some what disappointed in this product. I purchased this product after Hurricane Sandy to capture the local radio and tv stations. I am finding it difficult to locate the stations on the dial. Everything seems so close that one station bleeds into another.
1,This Radio SUUUUUCKS!,"I'll be brief. If this radio (Ambient Weather WR-333 Emergency Solar Hand Crank Weather Alert Radio, Flashlight, Smart Phone Charger) does what you need, then get it. You'll be much happier. I have both the WR-111 & this Kaito...The Kaito is junk!"
2,Kaito KA-007,"looks like it came out of a box of cocoa puffs, doesn't sound much better. analog tuning stinks, very little band separation. i'd much rather spend 2-3 times as much for something i would actually use than this toy. it's junk..."
1,false hope radio,"hello; I bought this radio to replace an identical radio that was the same except that one had a digital display..which after some time, began to show very inaccurate frequencies...so i pitched it....then i bought this NEW in box kaito KA-009 analog radio..the FM was okay....some short wave was barely okay, but the radio refused to tune in ANY weather band stations..which are easily received where i live, and this radio would NOT tune in ANY aircraft communication bands..instead, it picks up confused and unclear FM stations...i even connected an 85 foot slinky long distance antenna to this radio's antenna via clips and still, NO aircraft bands....mixed FM stations appear there....If you are like me, and receiving aircraft broadcasts and some weather bands is important to you, then do not buy this radio...you wont hear any on this radio.November 22. 2009."
1,Penguin should provide a new version,It may read well but it is one of the worst translations of the Dhammapada available and you're better off finding any other translation but this.It is more an interpretation using poetic terms than a translation of the original which is often more grave or more subtle.The editors of Penguin should update their Dhammapada Penguin classics version without insulting readers' credibilities for too long.
3,Somewhat Lacking the Essentials,"Avid's treatment of an individual artist seems to be to take as broad an approach as possible, thereby producing a conspectus. That hasn't been altogether successful here, because this set contains nothing of Louis' playing with King Oliver, nor of his accompaniments to blues singers, and virtually none of his great recordings of the early 30s under his own name. Instead the first disc features the duet with Earl Hines, four Hot Five tracks and one Hot Seven, after which it's mainly mid-thirties recordings with his orchestra. The second disc kicks off with eight orchestra sides from the late thirties, then features a number of duets with Jack Teagarden, Louis Jordan, Ella, Bing, Velma Middleton, and Billie Holiday, concluding with a live recording of ""Mack The Knife"". Louis it may be, but it falls short of meeting its own criterion."
4,Quick and easy Piggyback Mount,"One thing i could say about this mount is that its very solid. Made from cast iron. Two sets screws came with the unit, one shorter for the smaller scopes and the longer for the larger scopes. The installation is a snap since all i had to do was to remove two screws that goes around the outside by the rear of the tube and attach the mount with the supplied screws. A word of caution is to make sure you're using the right length screws. One problem i had was that when I tightened the thumbscrew onto my Canon Digital Rebel, the camera body was still on the loose side on the mount. I put down a layer of rubber sheet on the surface of the mount so that the camera was tight and snug onto the mount. Oh by the way.. the rubber sheet also protects the buttom of the camera since the mount surface is pretty coarse. Overall its a good compact mount with the right price that gives me the tracking ability of the scope for my camera to get wide angle sky shots."
4,Can't wait for book four,Challenges moved much faster than the first two books did. The plot sucked you in and wouldn't let you go. But the ending is a total cliffhanger. I'm buying book four as soon as it comes out.
4,Is it too much to ask that one completes a series swiftly,"I confess, I am a fan. Every book enchants me and draws me in, yet leaves me filled with intense frustration as I have to create my own ending to a tale that ends abruptly with the reader (me)poised at the very brink of discovery. Green does this every time and has been known to leave certain series incomplete. The Blending looks to be a set of five and I hate myself for not having had the will power to wait until all five have hit the market so that I could sink into a world of fantasy, feast my mind and soul before leaving sated with the knowledge that the saga is complete. Each hero and each heroine deserves their own book and I would not have it any other way but a year is just too long a wait no matter how good the writer."
4,GOOD STORYLINE FOR AN ENJOYABLE READING EXPERIENCE.,"THE STORY MOVES ALONG AT A PACE THAT DRAWS THE READER IN, AND IT CONTINUES TO DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE INTRICACIES OF THE SOCIETY THE FIVE PROTAGONISTS LIVE IN. MORE QUESTIONS ARE RAISED CONCERNING THE CHALLENGES THEMSELVES. BY THE END OF THE NOVEL, THE READER IS PUMPED UP FOR THE OTHER TWO BOOKS TO COME. I ENJOYED THE PERSONAL INTERACTIONS THAT DEVELOPED BETWEEN ALL OF THE CHARACTERS, BOTH THE GOOD GUYS AND THE BAD GUYS, AND I EAGERLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT 2 BOOKS."
4,Good But Not Great,"I recently broke my leg and was unable to work for 6 weeks. During this time period I read the first two books of the Blending and was very impressed. Some of the plot twists may be a little conventional but I really like the characters. While some interesting plot points were revealed in this third volume, I thought the first two books in the series were much stronger in advancing the plot. Also I was really disappointed that there was no warning that this was not the last book in the series prior to the ending. I really liked the way the Belgariad by Eddings always listed the titles of the future books and gave information on whether they were published yet or not. In general I would recommend this book, but if it has two more volumes as I suspect, I will wait until the fifth is available before reading the fourth."
4,"Good, but not satisfying.","I am very much a fan of Sharon Green, and, having read the first 2 books in this series, was eagerly awaiting its publication. I was disappointed that this appeared to be just another installment of Blendings, instead of its conclusion. But, I still found myself caught up in it, and I certainly want to find out how our heroes get out of this one!"
4,"It's a good book, but leaves you frustrated","I personally hate having to wait for sequels to come out. Therefore, I was really glad when Challenges came out relatively quickly. The series as a whole is quite entertaining and the storyline intrigueing. However, imagine my frustration to find out Challenges is NOT the end of the story. The story is left completely unresolved. So, if you want a good book to entertain you, go ahead and read this, but be prepared to have to wait once again."
3,alright,"the books pretty good but its really predictable, i mean you know somethings going to happen to Tammrissa and Vallant, or Narnan and Rion are going to get back together. But when I started this series it was really confusing when they called each other different names like Rion was called Mardimil as well and kept forgetting who was who. The way the nobles underestimate the commeners is really over exagerated."
3,"Good, but not typical Aragones picture cartoons","If you're looking for the classic no-words Aragones comics, then don't get this book. It is more like the comics you read in the papers."
2,"evil man,book is ok..","Agree with above, except it seemed though at times the book was apologetic for this evil man."
2,Review of Moser's Lucas Cranach,"The book devotes 1/3 of its content to facts about Lucas Cranach and his life, and it devotes 2/3 to the history of the 16th century in what is now north-central Germany. There are some nice prints of Cranach's work, but very little detail about the works themselves. This was a disappointment. There is no information on how he mixed his paints, where he got his paints, when he transferred a work from panel to canvas. These are things one would expect in a work on Cranach."
4,"Good songs, but not enough of 'em!","Too many skits - not enough songs. Granted, some of the skits are hilarious, no doubt, but, these guys know how to write some damn good tunes - should have put a few more no kidding songs on the album..."
4,Actually a 4.5,"This is a great album. It is so much fun to listen to with some great emo punk with keyboard-electronic background music. You can't take this album seriously, it is meant to be funny. The lyrics are ridiciously simple but you don't care cause your busy doing the robot dance in your car to the music. You just can't help but rock out with this cd. Most of the songs are really good even though they are kind of kidding around. Some of the members of the Get Up Kids are part of this made up band. It sounds like no other emo or punk band you've ever heard but you should enjoy it if you like some of the more pop sounding emo punk style, especially if you like the Get Up Kids. My favorites are #13,2,3,8 and all other songs."
3,Reggie and the full effect are the best,Well I have their first cd.The first cd is very very good I like all the song very much.people i know have listened to their new cd say it isnt as good i have listen to some song which are good.So who wver likes the first reggie cd should get their newest cd
3,"3 and 1/2 Stars is what it actually deserves, still good","There are some really cool songs on here; songs that fit in with their emo rock sound, or songs that parody other musical styles: german rock, country techno, and then there are others that just stop this cd dead in its tracks, like number four, and elevan. I love some of the tracks on this cd, but I hate having to skip around annoying songs that don't fit in or entertain."
4,Birthday Party Fun,"I bought this video, but watched a friend's since she had also bought one for her daughters party. She found many good things in the video that helped her have a successful party for her child."
3,KT has done better,This songbook reveals very few gems that are attractively sung by Sullivan and Nader. KT has done much better (the Bart Howard songbook) and I long to see her find some great material and really shine again.
5,Sanity at last!,"I've been waiting for a book like this for a long time. It offers, at last, a clear-headed and incisive analysis of the whole scandal mess in today's media. It's short, to-the-point, delightful reading that I found tremendously entertaining. Anybody who listens to the daily diet of dirty laundry on the news will love this book."
3,"Peepshow, no more, now its more of a bloodsport!!","Sabato was writing this book at the end of the Clinton era. His basic point is that the media was too focused upon the personal scandal that Clinton brought upon the White HOuse. However, presidential politics has moved so far beyond that as the Bush administration ushered in an era of hate, or adversarial media coverage. The book is a good review of what was happening, but I would argue it is no longer relevant because things have moved beyond what he describes. Get it for a good review of what was occurring, but don't expect it to offer an insight into what is going on today. Why have things taken this turn? Well, simply because covering the more risque aspects of a president's behavior no longer bring in the viewers. Rather, hating the president with whom you have little in common is what draws viewers."
3,"Basic information, nothing more.","This book will save you time but offers nothing more.Was hoping that more effort was spent on the personallity of each casino rather than basic information that can be found in minutes on the web.In fairness, the writer never claims the book would offer an opinion of each establishment... My mistake!Save your money and do the web work yourself."
3,A Even Money Purchase,"I bought this product a while ago. I get to LV once a year and Atlantic City 4 times a year. Most of the LV coupons are for the downtown casinos which I rarely have time to visit. I did use a few of the Atlantic City coupons, which about paid for the book. I did find some of the articles in the book interesting and informative."
5,"US Casinos, the Games, and coupons","Excellent listing of US Casinos (commercial and tribal) in this book. This is the seventh year I've bought this book and I'm always happy to use it as a reference guide when planning my trips, learning the games and a few tips.I'd like to see more details of all the casino properties such as total size of the casino gaming area.The coupons are helpful whether your a first time casino traveler or veteran. The coupon card makes it easier to use the coupons than in the past editions where the book must be physically presented and coupons handled by the employees.I have about three more vacation trips with this book. I'm looking forward to the 2008 edition. Enjoy!!"
1,Missing pages,"I ordered this book for the coupons for my upcoming trip to Las Vegas. The book was missing about 30 pages of coupons, all of which were Las Vegas coupons. I think this was simply a manufacturing error, because I had bought another, and it was fine."
5,"If Your Going to Buy a Coupon Book, Buy This One!",This is an amazing coupon book. I was astonished to see such valuable coupons in here! Lots of 2for1 buffets (and not only at the mediocre ones) There were even a few 2 for 1 Hotle stays (although not on the strip that I could tell).I think this was a VERY wise purchase!Viva Las Vegas!
5,The informative Gambling guide!,"For a novice like myself, this was just the book I was looking for. Intricate details on every casino in every state.....from the price of the rooms, to the price of the buffet! A must have!"
4,A concise guide - must have for the casino enthusiast,This book is very descriptive and has plenty of insight for the enthusiast. If you are just beginning in this field or are planning a junket - you must have this as a guide.
1,American Casino Guide: 2007,"I purchased this book last month (Jan 07') and as I was preparing the coupons for a trip to Vegas (Feb 07') I found that there were """"""32"""""" pages of coupons missing from the book. Of course """"all"""" of them were for my Vegas trip and they were the ones that I """"was"""" planning on using. I didn't notice these coupons missing until just now and don't have time to return the book for replacement before my trip.What a rip-off!!!!!!!Beware customers.......check your book upon arrival. I noticed that some people were selling ""just"" the coupons from this book on E-Bay, so I'm assuming that sellers are double-dipping and getting twice the $$ for this book between selling the book and also selling the coupons seperately.I'm so mad!!!!!"
1,Overrated!!!,"From reading other posted reviews, I thought this book would have a lot of substantive coupons for Las Vegas. I was wrong. The Vegas coupons are a joke; most of them pertain to second-rate casinos off the Strip. The best coupons are the 2 for 1 buffets (only a few of those), but there's only one per casino and you really need to be staying or gambling at that casino for the coupon to be practical. If you're thinking about buying this book primarily for the coupons, think again. My advice: Look at the book's actual coupons before buying it, then you won't be disappointed."
5,Top value in Las Vegas,"For a Las Vegas resident, the Casino Guide is a delight. One ""2fer"" for a buffet at a local casino covers the cost of the book. My friends and I purchase dozens of the Guide and use them throughout the year, primarily for the buffets. The gambling tips, rentals, etc. are all extras. Note that ""Strip"" coupons, especially for the major casinos, is light. The book has major value for locals."
3,Not very useful,"The book contains a directory of every casino in the U.S. with address, phone numbers, etc... Nothing you can't already find on the Internet. It also contains some articles on gambling, most of which are on the book's free web page site. There are coupons, but they're mostly from older, second rate casinos and are of marginal value. You can find the exact same coupons in the free local magazines in that city."
2,Ms. Hagerman,"I wasn't pleased with this years guide. It didn't have nearly the amount 0f buffet coupons that last years guide had. We were looking for the Sahara,Rio, and the Palms especially since we really had a good time last year out in Vegas with them. We were really disappointed with this years guide."
1,American Casino Guide 2007,Do NOT buy this book used. I did and when it arrived a good portion of the pages had been torn out. I sent it back and NEVER received my refund.BUYER BEWARE!!!
3,Textbook,"As a textbook, it is getting outdated. It is wordy and redundant, as well as hard to understand. The book is not an easy read, but tortuous to plough through."
5,A must have,"Very fast paced music. Not only the it has great beats but there are vocals in it to so you won't get bored hearing the same thing over and over again. If you like to go to dance clubs or listen to techno music this is a must have. Another good example is there are songs that as soon as you play them you get all excited and start dancing, well this is like one of those. Look for their other songs too like ""paraiso"" and "" On Y Va "" all great songs. Buy it today and I'll promise you'll never get tired of it."
4,I'm Not a Mormon but I liked this Book,"This book presents scholarly arguments in favor of the thesis that the Book of Mormon is an ""ancient book,"" i.e., not a hoax. It certainly evidences a higher respect for scholarship than most anti-mormon rants."
1,Only have to have a modicum of critical thinking skills,"I am not a Mormon basher. That being said I find it amazing in the 21st Century that a man who teaches anthropology at a major university publishes stuff like this that is based on zero science or scholarship. There is zero historical, anthropological, archeological or biological evidence for anything described in the BOM having to do with ancient civilizations. Imagine living in a state where this lack of critical thinking pervades to such an extent that it controls the politics and educational system?"
4,Pinmonkey is an original surprise !,"Pinmonkey isn't another boring pop-country band but a hot country band with a good sound, a mixture of contemporary country and traditional bluegrass.When I hear this album, I think about Marty Stuart."
2,not as good as all the reviews said,"I bought this Cd on amazon.com after hearing ""Barbed Wire & Roses"" on the radio and reading all these great reviews. I was actually disappointed. A couple a good songs. I am now sick of Barbed Wire & Roses. Overall not nearly as good as I had hoped or expected after reading the reviews here."
2,For women under 40 yrs,"This eye cream is not rich enough for women over 50 yrs. Maybe because it is in the winter, but my skin around my eyes was still dry after applying. Also, my makeup accentuated the fine lines when using this eye cream. I will try in the warmer months and see if eye cream does any better."
4,Just what I ordered.,Product shipped fast and was just what I ordered. After the install was completed it sounds and performs as expected. Much better than stock and will probably out live my truck.
4,"This is an excellent reader, not a narrative","This is an excellent collection of documents relating to the lynching of Emmett Till. However, it should be noted that Metress does not provide any real commentary on the documents which he has selected. This is a good book for those interested in writing on the Till or the southern press, and for those with the background knowledge to put the documents presented in a contextual backgound."
4,I Take it Back,"Earlier I gave a lukewarm review of this book. In hindsight, the book just was not what I expected. I expected a more narrative history and was disappointed when I did not get it. But that was not the author's intent. What is done here, is done exceptionally well. Truly fascinating. I'm so glad I picked it back up so I can correct the record."
2,Not the best out there,"I was not impressed. What I thought would be a thorough treatment of Till's lynching was instead a collection of others' work. So many different points of view makes it impossible to read as a narrative or as history. Interesting, yes, and the book has its place as a source of accounts written at the time of the murder and trial, but other books do a better job of presenting a complete account. If you get this book as a companion piece to other works, do yourself a favor and skip the author's commentary."
3,Decent Overview -- Some Errors,"In HOLY FATHER, author Greg Tobin offers a concise examination of the new Pope Benedict XVI.The brief (140+ page) book provides a cursory history of the papacy, then shifts to a review of Benedict's life in a generally well-structured, readable prose.The book was rushed into print fairly quickly after Cardinal Ratzinger's elevation to the papacy and suffers from several errors that could have been avoided by more judicious editing. One in particular is with respect to papal infallibility. There was no Ascension of the Blessed Mother, for example. Rather, the proper term is the ""Assumption"" of the Blessed Mother.Despite this, the book will provide a decent introduction to the new Pope, a gifted theologian who will guide the church most likely for a few years at least."
5,Omnivoid ROCKS,"This band is fantastic! All songs on this CD are awesome. The guitar playing, singing, and song writing are exceptional. Pick up this CD, you won't be sorry.."
4,FOREVER GOLDRUSH MAY HAVE HIT A RICH VEIN WITH FIRST CD,"IF YOU'RE VISITING CALIFORNIA'S CAPITOL, SACRAMENTO AND ARE ANYWHERE MIDTOWN LOOK FOR FOREVER GOLDRUSH--VOTED BEST NEW BAND IN SACTO. IT'S SACPOP COUNTRY ROCK AND THIS CD IS THE BETTER OR BEST OF THEIR USUAL GOOD PERFORMANCES. THEY'RE BETTER LIVE BUT THE CD DOES THEM JUSTICE. I'D GIVE 'EM A FIVE BUT THEY'LL EARN THAT. HAVING MET THE BAND MEMBERS I'LL SAY THIS IS ONE BAND THAT WON'T LET FAME GO TO THEIR HEADS. THEY'RE HARD WORKING (AND ALSO WORK REGULAR GIGS) AND SEEM TO GET GOOD VENUES AND STEADY FANS. THEY HAVE A GREAT FOLK ROCK SOUND WITH THEIR OWN CONTEMPORARY STAMP. CHECK THEIR SOUND OUT! bob terry."
3,Derivative non-conformist story,"The Bottom Line:Evil, a manifestly undeserving Oscar Nominee for best foreign film, not only suffers from some lapses in storytelling (in the first scene the main character Erik is shown heartlessly bullying another student, but for the rest of the film he's almost saintly in his goodness with no explanation given whatsoever) but happily plunders just about every non-conformist-in-a-school type film there is, presenting a story that's a shade more brutal than most of its inspirations but much less inspired; it cannot be denied that this is a watchable piece of entertainment, but if you've seen three or four movies before you'll be able to predict the plot of this one 20 minutes in.2.5/4"
5,Excellent price $2.88 for 25,"I purchased three of these sets. The first was well made and zinc plated. The second was cadmium plated and not as well made, the retaining end was smaller and not sharply stamped out. The third was cadmium plated and well made like the first one. I assume the one was made in China as the 2 that were well made were made in the USA. Even with the price increase $5.76 this is priced half when compared to rock auto."
2,Disappointing,"The films were terrible, and you could hardly understand what was going on. I only watched a few, maybe they got better, but I gave the film to a friend. use your own judgment."
3,Just OK,I guess for the price its a good buy. Some fights are really good where others are kind of slow.
3,Its ok but needs a locking feature,"This is an ok item. The only problem is that it can swing to easy and throw the person getting up, off balance. You can use it to left yourself up but not pull yourself up. It needs a locking device on it to keep it from swinging."
5,Awesome,Had seen Larue perform on God TV and was excited to see the CD available on Amazon. All I can say is AWESOME Great messages in the songs but you dont have to be religiou to enjoy them Natalie has SUCH a great voice ! This is a MUST BUY
1,"Awful, Just plain Bad....","I am so so so so disappointed in this cd. I am/was a pretty big Larue fan. But this cd is awful. It is so slow and depressing there are NO, NONE, upbeat fast songs that I love. It is awful. DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,Useless while driving.,Youll never get a good signal while driving. Stop your car and youll have to move until you find a spot where the signal is good
5,Love this bk,I paid .50c and it was practically brand new. I used this bk for my nursing classes to help summarize my reading. I would recommend getting this bk to nursing students. The edition doesn't matter much because it has the same information.
2,move on up to the East Side,"As previous reviewers have stated, this camera has major battery drain issues. I Recieved the 580 last night for an early Christmas present and 24 hours later it's packed, ready to go back. After taking about 15 pics and messing around with the set up, the first set of Alkalines ran out. The second set didn't last one picture!! The third set three or four. It does state on their website that it doesn't recommend Alkalines but instead tells you to use a $13.00 one that lasts maybe 20 or 30 times more. And for rechargeble Ni's you'll probably need ten sets.I reccomend you move up to the Canon A95. For a hundred bucks more you get a much better camera. Check it out. It has dozens of better features including a state of the art processing chip, a flexible display, manual options, and a better focusing system. Save your self the trouble with this Olympus unless your daddy owns Duracell."
1,Worst digital camera ever,"Batteries: I bought Olympus Ni-MH batteries. By the time you go through a few menu items red light on battery starts to come out. When it goes dead, you cannot even close the cover.Usability: Everything in menus which eats up battery power. Menus are confusing, blink out instantly and I thought Hieroglyphics went out of fashion with egyptians. You make changes, but the camera like resolution of the picture but it reverts back to another resolution all on its own.Quality: snapshots of landscapes are OK, but the camera cannot focus anything closer than 10 yards.I think the name fits this camera: Camedia but I think it is misspelled it shoud read ""Comedy"" of a camera.I own 5 digital cameras, this one is a big dissapointment."
4,Great Point & Shoot Camera,This is a great little point & shoot camera. I paid $199 at Costco.It take really nice pictures and is VERY easy to use. The only downside is it's slow to focus in low light.I keep the flash off and the LCD off to save batteries.It's a great first digital or travel camera.
2,"Pictures themselves are good, design and value are poor","As the title would indicate, I really don't like this camera. I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $199 and got it for my parents for Christmas. The actual picture quality is pretty good. 4MP is certainly quite crisp. It is fairly compact as well.I ended up returning the camera, and here is why. First, needing to slide the shutter to turn it on is not intuitive, and annoying. Second, I had some problems getting the lens to retract sometimes when I did close the shutter. Third, I was also surprised that the camera didn't come with a rechargable battery. Most cameras these days come with one, and it basically felt like they were skimping on accessories. Fourth, the screen on the camera was very laggy and low resolution compared to nearly all others I have seen. I was not impressed."
2,Battery HOG! Just not worth it,"I had one of the first Olympus digitals - a 2.1 mp - and loved it. It finally broke after years of pounding - and decided to stay brand loyal.I'm getting ready to box the new one up and return it. I used rechargeables - as well as 6 other pairs of batteries to feed this camera - and it just burns through them like nothing. The ""free"" batteries it comes with lasted maybe 10 minutes - and that was just turning the camera on and playing with the settings. And I never even used it for video.The speed of the camera seemed just as slow as my 2.1 - and the quality was not as good for some of my shots. I'm not high tech when it comes to cameras - but this one just didn't seem to have the right speed or adequate lighting. It was too bright on some shots - and others WAY too dark.The good to the camera - it is small - but I guess in this instance - size doesn't matter - b/c I don't like this camera at all."
4,Worked great up until...,"I found this camera to be very easy to use right out of the box. The software installation went off without a hitch and I was able to view the pictures on my PC with ease. Anyone looking for a first-time digital camera would be very pleased with the package Olympus has put together here. However, after only having had the camera for four days, the lens would no longer retract when I went to turn the camera off. So now, the camera beeps and the indicator lights near the viewfinder constantly blink which if I read the manual correctly indicate some kind of battery problem (which it isn't). I'm planning on exchanging it for another one and hopefully, this lens problem is just with the camera I have now."
3,"Great Camera, bad battery life",This was a great camera for us. The only problem is we got about 24 pictures out of a set of batteries and they were done. We only kept the camera for about 3 months because of that. It was just to much of a hassle. We may have had better luck with more expensive batteries but after a year of buying them we could have just bought a camera with a rechargeable battery.
3,Was good in the day,"This was my second digital camera and while it was good for the first year, after that it began locking up. I would take a picture and the camera would freeze and I would have to shut it off and try again. I lost many good shots because of this and it led to me buying a new camera."
3,Don't forget extra batteries!,"The camera takes nice pictures but even with rechargeable batteries, they have to be replaced after about 20-25 pictures, maybe more depending on how often you open and close the camera. I always have to have extra batteries charged and with me because we never make it through an event without having to replace the batteries at least once, ofter more. Also, there is a long delay between pressing the shutter button and the actual taking of the picture. I have missed so may shots because of this!"
4,Another wonderful Olympus product,"My first digital camera was a Olympus D-390. It was great,but it was a fixed lens(no optical zoom). Then I tried a kodak cx6230 and really didn't care for it at all. I considerd the D-540 and Stylus 410. My wife sort of borrowed it,and seems like it very much. She likes the auto program mode and the sharp picture quality. I use rechargeable batteries and always have a spare set charged and use the LCD monitor to much to tell you how many pictures I get out of a pair of batteries. I have had this camera for a couple of months and shot over two hundred pictures and have not been disappointed."
1,Bad product; awful customer service,"I bought one of these as a backup to my more expensive camera, so I didn't use it much for the first 3-4 months. I took it to a company event about two months ago and the thing actually shorted out: I took a group photo and then shut the cover and when I opened the cover a few minutes later, the camera body was very warm and none of the LEDs would light up. I took the batteries out and they were too hot to touch.For the past month I have been haggling with Olympus. They do not seem willing to perform warranty repair even though I've still got 6 months left on the warranty. Every time I contact them via e-mail it is a couple of weeks before I hear anything again.This was my first Olympus camera and I guarantee it will be my last. Bad product, terrible customer service."
2,Eats batteries,"I like this camera a lot, but as other reviewers have noted, it eats batteries in no time at all. I orginally bought rechargables but found that they didn't have the power depth to last more than a few shots (like maybe 10 or 20). I switched to alkalines, which last a little longer, but what a waste of money to keep buying new ones.It seems like the problem is that there is a huge drain on the battery on each shot taken because if you let the camera rest for a while, the batteries will eventually allow it to take another shot (after you turn the camera off, of course).I bought this camera based on Amazon reviews, which were very helpful. Next time I'll wait until the product has been on the market long enough to find out about these kinds of problems."
5,Excellent,"I love this group's version of ""La Bamba"". I have heard a lot of versions of ""La Bamba"" but I love this version because I think it sounds like something out of Vera Cruz, Mexico.Also, if you love Spanish classics, I think you will really enjoy this CD. (I used to have the LP years ago and somehow it disappeared and am so glad that I found it on Amazon.com.)"
5,Relaxing and friendly,"Oswald is very polite even when his friends aren't. I would still give this five stars even though his friends Henry and Daisy don't truly take the blame for their part in things that go wrong. That can be the part the parents point out. Also the parents can point out the fact that penguins don't come from the ""Frozen North"". Oswald is very lovable looking and pleases my 1-year-old baby. She smiles as if seeing an old friend when I put this on."
5,"Omigosh, Buy this Oswald 2pak!","Oswald is such a breath of fresh air. I adore the quirkiness of Oswald's world, all the characters have character(hee, hee), and the plots relate to situations that young ones encounter in life. And the price- trust me, it's great- I had to stop myself from doing a cartwheel in a cluttered living room. Thanks!"
3,Oswald five book set,The books are in excellent condition but I only received four so I plan on finding out why I paid for five and received four.
1,Revlon Colorstay Disappointment,"I was eagerly awaiting my order as it was forwarded to me in Japan from my home in the U.S. I was so disappointed when I realized that the color was not the same as the product I had ordered a few months earlier. I`ve used Revolon Colorstay products for the last 6 years and Cappuccino was always my color. However, I think Revlon has changed the color (I compared it with the product still remaining in an older container) and now I`m out of about $40 (including shipping) as I ordered more than one bottle.My advice, check the color before ordering more than one even if you`ve used the product for some time."
2,Not worth the time,"'The Girls' is a cliche-laden view of four aged sisters I wouldn't want to know. The protagonist, Jenny, is annoyingly still the 'good' child at 80,and her sister, Flora, is beyond tolerating. The descriptions of Miami are hackneyed and Jenny's,(obviously the author's) philosophy is expounded in disjointed and unlikely places."
2,A word to the wise,"As with many philosophers, the words are more important than their meanings and in their futile attempts to out-vocabulary other intellectual ""elites"" they view as their competition, they totally lose credibility with their verbose flailings.Pretty much a waste of time."
3,Who Translated??,"This book has been an immense help, having read it along side the Kaufman translation. But who translated THIS version? To have any kind of legitimacy as a reference, the translator must be known!"
3,A List,"Just another list that I haven't started yet. Anybody can accumulate a list, but explaining an idea would help us all more."
3,Mary S.,I only read this to follow through with the struggle of the monster in Frankenstein and it was a knowledgeable book.
5,A Fun Read,"This was a fun read. I'm venturing into the world of Special Education and picked up this book to get one's perspective. This book taught me that things will happen and the best thing you can do is have a sense of humor about it. I would recommend it to anyone, in special education or not."
3,not the flavors pictured,"candy came fast but was not what was pictured. It was the new variety with mango and pineapple, NO lime or red apple things. bummer"
3,"Dichotomy, anyone?","This book of poetry is a declarative statement festival, mixing in classic and modern allusions with aplomb. Enjambment is copiously employed to heighten the stand-up line effect throughout the poems. Here hard truths are given glibly, yet offer majesty."
5,Great Read,Delightfully Playful and Dark! I couldn't put it down.This was my first experience with Dean Young's poetry and I am officially a fan!Check out my review at[...]
2,Tough to use. Doesn't cover baby,A blanket works better than this item. It is not warm because the sides leave large breezy gaps. Not good for cold climates.
4,Love it but..........,"I love the cover, but wish it was longer. My daughter is only 5 months old and is already kinda snug on the bottom."
3,Not as thick as I hoped,"I would have liked for this to be a thicker cover. I still felt like it I needed to put a blanket on my son with this on. However, a blanket did fit inside the cover which was nice. The hood is nice but is big and leaves room for air to get through. I used it without the hood. Not very easy to put on by yourself-need someone to help you get it adjusted. For the money, I would pass."
4,Kept the lil guy warm...,Doesn't hook on a good as I expected. But it works better then a blanket. Knowing this I'd still buy it.
1,Totally inadiquate for cold weather,"This cover is just that, a cover. It provides zero warmth and barely acts as a barrier between the cold and your baby. The paperwork included with the cover even instructs you not to rely on the cover for warmth and to dress your baby for the weather. I had hoped to use this while on a recent trip to canada as strollers are impossible on the snow and ice covered sidewalks. This was a huge disappointment."
1,does not enclose the back side,"I had hoped that this product would be more like a sleeping bag, when in reality, it is just a cover with a big open back. There was no closing mechanism on the back side (besides pushing against my body) and the hood kept falling down on my daughter's face.Tried it once, returning it.Looks cool, but not really functional."
5,Regrets that I didn't bought it for my first one!,"Great cover! I just regret that I didn't bought it for my first one!Easy to install and take of no matter if your baby is front or back facing. The baby will stay warm, dry and cosy in there! Also the washing is very easy always good with those little babys who spitting a little bit."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This product is great! My son absolutely loves it! This has given me more freedom to walk around, especially when I have my dog with me. My only issue was that it shipped through Amazon and it took FOREVER to get to me. Not sure why..."
5,great baby cover up,"This fits well over the BabyBjorn Carriers while reducing the bulk of bundling a baby. Very useful in cooler weather when you want to ""wear"" baby rather than use a stroller."
4,"great material, fits well, needs better way to clip on carrier","I love this cover except for the ease of use in clipping it to the carrier and taking it off. It would be better if it would snap on but you have to pull the straps through the 'button' hold and it's not convenient when you need to take it off and put it on quickly. I was walking around going in and out of stores and she just got hot in the stores. I couldn't pull it down and up for temperature changes easily. Apart from that, it's a great product. I recommend the carrier to all new mom's.."
4,Comforting cover,This cover is great. It is very comforting knowing my little one was always warm. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it's not real snug around the baby's shoulder area. There is a little space that you have to pull tight to make sure wind didn't get through.
4,Bjorn Cover,"It is great for the winter, since it protects baby from cold and wind. I wish it were waterproof. It is very easy to put on and take off."
5,Best sound to come from a local band in years,Incredible energy and sound. A great variety for all ages of modern roc
2,Noisy unless you replace the fan,"This is NOT quiet, as described... with the case closed you can hear it from 20 feet away!Bought it for a HTPC system... was very disappointed.Replaced the fan it came with, with a good 80mm fan (using cable ties), and it's very quiet now."
5,Total body toning,This is a total body toning workout in which a tube will be used for the upper body segment. Ms. Mallett is helpful in breaking down the steps for a kicking routine. She emphasizes having fun and you will sense that with her dynamite smile and her laughter throughout. You have the freedom to select your workout because there is a chapter selection and the amount of time for each. Good for beginners.
4,Good Low-Impact Workout,"This is my first Tracey Mallet workout. Cathe Friedrich is still my favorite, but Tracey does a good job with this workout. The only difficulty in the beginning was Tracey's accent. I really had to listen carefully to get what she was saying, but once you have done the workout a few times, you'll get it. It's low-impact but a lot of the moves are challenging and interesting. She demonstrates the moves slowly in the beginning, then picks up the pace. It's fun and enjoyable."
4,Happy Boot Camper,"I really enjoyed this workout. It's not a cardio workout, it's definitely a firming workout, focusing on abs and buns. You do need a tube, although you can still do the workout without it. I really like Tracey she's so upbeat and positive. I love that she's so versatile and has a lot of different excercises so you don't get bored, and the punches and kicks are fun. This is a good workout to do every other day, it would be challenging for a beginner, and a good workout for someone more advanced, but if you're looking for super challenging this isn't the workout for you. Have fun and enjoy!"
3,LO MEJOR DE LA CUMBIA,La alegría y la diversión de este conjunto musical trasciende las fronteras y las épocas. No debe faltar en ninguna casa.
2,"Standard art film, timing a bit off","This was a dark look at the daily struggles of daily life. I gave it a low rating because the editing is disjointed. This may be due to the heavy censorship because it deals with very sensitive subjects like drug abuse, prostitution, child abuse, and suicide. (by the way, this is not an erotic movie in anyway.)"
1,Not what I expected.,"It's cheesy. I haven't tried hanging my small watercolors with them because they don't look like they would hold much weight. If you want to hang a calendar I think they would work, fine."
3,Not as good as Me on the Map,"I ordered this book because I loved Me on the Map. This book was fine, but not really worth buying--just rent from the library.It isn't that there is much to criticize, although I understand some people's concern that Pluto is still listed as one of the nine planets. (I actually didn't mind because I was brought up on Pluto and prefer my children to remember it.) But it just wasn't that valuable as an addition to the library. Each planet is explained in order, with nice pictures and a couple easy facts which kids can appreciate. The distance away from the sun is included for each. But there is really nothing else. At the end the child asks the question is there could be another galaxy, solar system, planet, person like them, so kids get the point of the hierarchy. But I found that a kind of silly way to end the book. I wish it had been a little more informative."
4,Gift for a friends new baby!,"Brought this for a friends new baby. It's an old school treatment for infant colic, and every new mother should have it on hand. Five drops in six ounces of water and instant relief for the baby!!"
1,A great... book?,"This is truly a fantastic resource for the ever increasing number of ""jumpy jumpy elephants"" in american households. If your child is an uncontrollable hyperactive mess of energy, order your copy today. However, I feel it is incorrect to call this listing a book, as that would require at least 2 pages. This might be more accurately described as a ""hardcover pamphlet"" or a ""cruel joke for people with too much money and bad parenting skills""."
3,Solid but disappointing,"An extremely intelligent and valuable book. In my experience of teaching it for several years, undergraduates find it overly dense and off-putting. Its strongest points are the numerous brief but well thought out summary ethnographic examples from the !kung-san to the Inka. Weakest point is the authors' conviction that school of Marvin Harris cultural evolutionism is the only useful key to thinking about human history"
5,Contains many useful recipes for different ailments,"I have some Black Cumin seed from a website called www.blackseedusa.com and the book contains many wonderful recipes to use the Black Cumin seeds and oil for different ailments. I am eagerly waiting for the authors to write another book on the subject. To be sure you have the true Black Cumin always look for the botanical name ""Nigella sativa"""
1,DO NOT BUY FOR DIAPER RASH!!,"Do not buy if it is for your baby as diaper rash cream!!!!! The formula (and product packaging) has changed as of Feb 2011!!! I am posting this to forewarn all parents. I had been using the ""original"" formula since November 2009 and just went out and ordered 5 more 14oz tubs. Guess what? not only has the packaging changed, but the formula is totally different and WORSE!!!!It is now 30% lanolin (as opposed to 50%) and now contains a chemical called Disodium EDTA which is likely NOT good for your baby. STAY AWAY and don't buy anymore!! I'm so mad, b/c the original formula worked and i was going to use it forever. Warn your friends the formula has changed!! So important!!!"
3,I thought it was a strange book but good effort.,I know quite a bit about the author. The book is good but very strange
5,Absolute Conviction,"A perfect Morse adventure. Plenty of twists & puzzles with an unusal backdrop. A modern English prison with a female Governor; 3 partners, all in the same prison one of whom is murdered & Morse is called in. One of Colin Dexter's very best."
5,Wonderful Fun,"I love Inspector Morse and watch it everytime I get a chance. This episode of the series was the best because the story kept me guessing. Plus it had Sean Bean in it. He plays a fun charsimatic character. You will really enjoy this, I know I did."
4,Proof Your Parents Loved You,"Seriously? It's flavored sugar with candy that you lick and dip in the sugar so as to eat sugar with your candy that is mostly pressed sugar.That said. It's sooo good. And if your parents let you have it they obviously loved you because no one ACTUALLY wants to hand a kid a bunch of sugar and say, ""GO FOR IT!""At least that's my take on it.-Mike"
5,Great candy! Super-fast delivery!,"This yummy candy, which is hard to find in our area, was delivered super-fast -- much to the delight of my child (and my inner child)."
2,I like it,This is a book that is simple enough for my kids to get something out of and is general enough to give a good understanding of chemistry.
3,Reviewing a Calendar?,"Well, yes! I loved this calendar because I collect old world style, antique maps and this calendar has 12 great photo's of maps that I can frame after the year is over."
1,Item received damaged,"The item had been removed with a pair of pliers by a previous customer and was crushed in the middle. I had removed my previous oil filter and did not discover the problem until I had changed my oil, and did not discover the damage to the new filter until I opened the sealed box to install the filter. The employee who packaged this filter had to know it was damaged, so this was sent in this condition intentionally. These people are dishonest and don't care about their customers. Do not do business with these people."
4,shows the real Patty,"Shows the human side of Patty, and what it was like from the Hearst family POV. Enough has been written about the abduction, this is a necessary personal view of Patty.. Although a little self-serving and may be cashing in on the abduction, it's accurate.Ends too abrubtly and leaves too many questions as to what happened after the shoot-out."
1,My Search for Patty Hearst,"A Disappointing, self serving attempt to cash in on the abduction. Spends too much time discussing a blissful relationship with Patty and not enough about the abduction, etc. Completely ignores the time Patty stayed with the Harris' following the shoot out in LA.Spends way too much time wallowing in his own self-pity.No wonder Patty wanted to stay with the SLA."
4,Celestron Polar Axis Finder for CG-s Mounts; Short hex screws!,"Celestron Polar Axis Finder for CG-4 and CG-5 Mounts. by Celestron: I don't have a CG-4, mine is a CG-5... I think most of peoples complains have to do with the 3-hex screws, the reason for this is to center the reticle's X as you spin the mount. I removed the 3 scews and got larger ones from Home-Depot and centered as described in the scope enclosed literarure-Fig-2 page 1. As for polar align of the mount esentially once you adjust your latitude, while polaris is place on the ""reticle circle"" that sorrounds the X, the scope will rotate at most 180 degrees about the X point within the rim. Thats all.. The scope is of fine quality and a good product, the instructions need to be revised. I give the scope 4-Stars only because the hex screws were to short."
2,Needs lighting,The product is well made but it's VERY difficult to center the scope in the mount - this is well before you even point it at Polaris... The adjustment screws are three TINY TINY hex-head screws and there is no consistent way to only slightly move the balance one way or the another. ASLO - I would not buy a non-illuminated alignment scope again. There needs to be a red light behind the diagrams and lettering.It's a good deal if you've the patients to use it and a dim red flashlite held in front of it...Steve
5,I truly recommend this book!!!!!!,"I first read this in the 3rd grade. I'm 29 now, but I still oftentimes browse through it to relive those childhood memories!"
3,just ok,"It functions fine. Hard to find the type of staples it uses, but it is printed on the side of the thing.Biggest complaint is that it doesn't have a very good guide rail in the front. Some staple guns have a guide which helps with accuracy...especially good for putting up electrical cords. This stapler does feel good in my hands though."
5,Excellent,A high quality stapler that is cheaper than the standard walmart/home depot varieties. Easy to use and appears to have the possibility of lasting years of use!
4,Takes good photos..,"..but has some drawbacks. One is that it's too easy inadvertantly to open the aku cover while holding the camera for a snapshot. Photo quality is very good, can enlarge to 8""x10"", but not as good as the C 300, which is no longer produced (the C 300 is the cat's meow). The successor is the C55 in Europe, the C5500 in the U.S. The 410 is smaller than the C 300, water tight and very light, good for long distance hiking, is light because it uses an akku rather than 4 standard heavy batteries. If you're not concerned with weight and watertightness, buy the C 55. I find the 410 a bit too small to hold comfortably, it's about the same size as our Olympus all weather mu-II film camera, but one has a better grip on the latter. With the Olympus quality (I'm told they bought Leica's lenses), film is out unless you want to make slides."
3,Weak Flash ruins an otherwise good camera,"Most of the comments I have about this camera are positive. Fast focus, quick shutter release, nice interface and sharp lens. Great quality photos/color in good lighting.But there are two flaws that stand out:* The flash is incredibly weak. Forget group shots or anything that's not 8' from you or in bright light. It is just awful.* Slide-open cover prevents sticking it in your pocket with the strap on top. Every time I stick this camera in my pocket it slides the lens cover off and the camera powers up in my pocket (lens extends, etc.) Yes, I know I could simply turn the camera around so it'll power up when I pull it *out* but then the strap is on the wrong side. Olympus... move the strap to the other side, or at least give us an option of where to mount the strap.I recommend the Canon A85 over this camera. Yes it's bigger and not weatherproof, but it's 14' flash power is worth the sacrifice."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I owned a 2.1 megapixal Olympus - loved it! I bought the 410 - hated it! It takes terrible pictures indoors, great pictures outdoors. I worked and struggled with this camera for 2 years and then threw in the towel and bought a Canon A620. I love, love love it! It just works! In every situation. It's easy and intuitive to use."
2,I wish I had shopped around more,"I purchased this camera based on my satisfaction with an older Olympus film camera, Generally good Amazon reviews and the metal body. It is a nice looking solid camera. Since I have purchased this camera though, I have not been happy with the image quality. I've adjusted settings, cleaned up photos afterwards but I've tried a couple of other peoples cameras that were comparable to mine and the pictures are noticably better, sharper and better color/lighting right out of the box at the default settings. If you are just looking for a decent point and shoot camera that takes great pictures right out of the box, I think there are much better options out there."
2,Time delay,I agree wiht the other review. The delay is ridculous. When I take a picture of my 18 month old twins and I press the button they are doing something cute. By the time the picture takes at least one baby is not even in the picture anymore.
2,Horrible low light / night pics,I loved this camera when I first got it but there is one flaw that just makes me say that it is not worth the buck. In any low light or night setting the LCD does not show a thing and the view finder is too small for you to see anything in low light or night. So it makes this camera completely useless in low light or night time pics. I have called Olympus 2xs about this thinking there has to be something wrong with my camera but I was reassured nothing was wrong it is just how the camera works. I was very disappointed and would never recommend this camera to anyone.
1,The item i never recieved,"After patiently waitng the entire month for the camera to come by 10 /20/2009 and 10/20 coming and going with no item in my mail I have really become apprehensive about further buys online.I emailed the seller twice and never recieved a responce from them.and amazon's complaint page is difficult to navigate or non exhistant. can someone offer any suggestions as to how to resolve this non delivery of my item ,.FHoward"
2,Not up to Olympus Standards,"My camera broke right after the warranty period was up.The slide mechanism that covers the lens I thought was so cool at first ended up being the weak link. It triggers a switch when slid open to power-on the camera. Either the slide or the switch broke and the camera refused to take pictures when I slid the cover open. I could preview the pics I already took, but nothing else. When it DID work the picture quality was about fair. My friend has a Kodak 5 megapixel that cost about half the price of the Olympus that takes considerably better pictures and is much easier to use."
1,Very disappointed.,"I do not recommend this camera. After a short time, the barrier slider came loose, and I had to continually tighten the screws. They finally came out on their own and I had to pay $25 for the entire slider from Olympus just to get the screws. All I needed were the screws! After replacing the screws, the flash died. I got screwed, huh? And, as many of the other reviewers mention, this is a problem that many owners have. Same with the barrier slider. WHAT'S UP WITH OLYMPUS? I paid a lot of money for this camera and am very disappointed. I will never buy an Olympus product again. I recently purchased the Nikon D40 and am extremely happy with it."
2,I don't love this camera,"We received the 400 model as a Christmas gift about 2 yrs ago and I have to say I've been fairly disappointed. The flash is way too much and blows out most of the photos...the slide mechanism to open/close gets stuck sometimes and overall picture quality is not so good. I'm trading it in for a Cannon SD1000, I think we will get much better results."
1,Do not buy this camera,"I have had this camera for a year and half. Just recently the flash decided to stop working. Upon looking at other websites to try and trouble shoot, I found at least 100 other people who were complaining about the same problem. When I called Olympus they said that I would have to pay 100 dollars to fix the problem plus shipping. When I told them about the fact that there were 100's of people with the same problem, they said it was not there problem. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA"
2,Washed out colors and a low light faliure,"I am seriously disappointed in this camera.I purchased it thinking that it would take better photos than my old Stylus 1.5 Digital. WRONG!The colors are washed out and in low light forget it. You will get blurry pictures. The flash still produces blurred pics. What do they expect you to do, use a tripod constantly?What a mistake I made.Don't you make one too."
4,Cute,cute book I bought for a new dad it is kind of corny but it made him laugh and I'm sure he'll enjoy it with his little girl
4,Solid product,"I have been using this foundation for a number of years now and really like the dewy aspect that it lends my complexion. I only wish it was a bit cheaper. That said, it does last a fairly long while, since only a bit of product is needed to achieve a glowing, even skin tone."
5,Provides good coverage.,I like this foundation because it provides good coverage. It is slightly creamier and heavier than most foundations. The pump is a nice feature and prevents any mess. I apply the foundation with a sponge. I prefer to use this foundation in the evening. It can be used in the daytime but I prefer a lightweight foundation for the day. Use with Chanel loose powder for a flawless finish.
4,"Very Lively ""Ramainz"" of the Ramones!!!!!","I bought this live album only because I wanted to hear how Dee Dee sings his own ""Chinese Rocks"" and..... It turned out to be bad! But the energy of the band is so raw and lively, and makes you dance just like original Ramones live albums do. Dee Dee's then wife Barbara is singing half of the tunes and she does pretty good, and the drummer Marky Ramone, who's the best thing happened in this album personally, shows absolutely fabulous play, keeping Ramones metronomic rhythm yet really dynamic on tums and cynbals. Actually Marky keeps this band together.Anyway, I'm content that I bought this album, it's still quite a heavy rotation in my household!"
5,"Wow, What an Interesting Story","Like everyone else I had heard of this event in the news. Reading about what each miner was thinking at specific times was super interesting. I like that the author included the families in the time line. For me it was the perfect amount of information. I learned what was meant by ""building walls"" and also about the code that is printed on the inside of the miners hard hats, that's information I would have never learned about without reading this book.I definitely recommend this book."
3,"An amazing story, but lacking...","First and formost this is a good book. It really brings to life a situation people who are not miners can barely understand. I myself picked the book up on a whim to read a good story and I got just that.I did however feel the book was lacking somewhere. Maybe it was the lack of detail or maybe it was the way in which it was written, I just felt it could have 'bowled me over' a little more than it did.If you would like to read an amazing story about an amazing group of people this is a book you should read. Just don't look for anything too amazing on the pages."
3,Good Writing but Bad Attitudes,"I appreciated hearing the miners' own words about this terrifying experience. It was truly inspirational. I feel compassion and understanding for the emotional roller coaster experienced by their families as a result of these events. However, I was ultimately disgusted by the words of some of the family members criticizing and complaining about how management and public officials handled the rescue. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent and an enormous amount of people devoted expertise, time, and energy to the rescue effort. This work documented few or no expressions of appreciation and thanks from family members for these efforts, only ongoing and constant criticism and complaints about people that were doing their absolute best in difficult circumstances. It's one thing for a distressed person to be freaked out and disappointed when a rescue is not going perfectly. That is forgivable. What is documented in this book goes far beyond that."
3,It's a pretty good debut album. Nothing special though.,"This album is pretty good. But I, personally, like their newer stuff better, like Bliss & Death, Primitive Parade, Broadcasting Vol. 1 & 2, Already Gone EP. Don't get me wrong, there are some really good songs on here, but for the most part, nothing that really grabs your attention. If you're a fan of National Skyline, check it out. If you're new to the band, check out some of their newer stuff first."
3,Neat,"This c.d is really nice, the only reason i don't give it 4 stars is because the price is way too much for just 7 songs. Jeff Garber and Jeff Dimpsey can create some really spooky atmospheres with their music. Overall a decent debut ep, for perfection you should check out the Exit Now EP, it's only 4 songs but they all blew me away."
5,A Great Read,"As someone who occasionally writes travel articles myself, I thought this was a brilliant and engaging account by a man who set out to, well, to be himself, once and for all. The birding is woven together with the author's sweet but apparently doomed romance in a way that kept me flipping pages. A wonderful read for any birder."
4,stylish yet practical,I have a two year old and a 10 month old. I also own the Graco Quattro Duo. The Graco is very sturdy and the seats are bigger to accomodate a larger child but very difficult to push and steer. The Kolcraft Contours Tandem is much easier to steer and push. The seats are smaller and I have a tall 2 year old I don't anticipate it will fit my two year old next year. Overall a good stroller at a good price point.
4,Good Buy,Over all this is a very good stroller. We have a 2 1/2 year old and a one month old and this is the best way to get them to our local park. Very well built stroller.
4,DOUBLE STROLLER,This stroller is the best. I have a three year old and a 6 month old. I have had the stroller for about 4 months now and use it all the time. I get stopped by stranger wanting to know where I got the stroller and how well does it work. The only down side to this stroller is that its weighs more than the average stroller and that you have to take one seat off to fold it up. My children are very comfortable in it and it is easy to push. Just make sure you have a large trunk it you want this stroller.
3,Good for the price!,"Good stroller, overall. My kids (3 & 1) likes to be carried by us, but now prefers to be seated in the stroller. Having them facing each other doesn't work; legroom is way too small and they start complaining that one of them is touching the other! It gets kind of wobbly when turning at times, especially when walking on a steep or curvy sidewalk. Storing it in our SUV does take some time, but I can't complain for the price."
4,Love this stroller,"I love this stroller I have a 1 yr old and a 1 week old and this stroller is very easy to push. The only thing I wish were different are the sun shades, my 1 yr old sits up straight and the sun shade is great for her, it keeps her face shaded most of the time, however, my 1 wk old has to recline and the sun shade doesn't cover much of him at all, we are constantly having to take his seat off and turn him the other direction every time we turn a corner. Other than the sun shades not being big enough, we love this stroller, I am very happy with my purchase."
2,Not pleased!,This stroller is way too heavy. My husband literally threw his back out moving it from the car to the house. Also the seats are not big enough for my child. She is very tall and she can ride it in but not comfortably. Plus with an infant seat attached there is no room to recline her chair. My advice is keep looking and good luck!
3,"Good Concept, BUT.....","We bought this intending to use it for our 2-year old and newborn. I thought it was great that you could attach the infant seat. The claim that it ""fits most infant car seat brands"" is misleading. It does accommodate many brands, BUT NOT all infant carriers within each brand. Unfortunately, this info is not available on the mfr website, but only in the assembly instructions. And our infant carrier (Evenflo On My Way) is one of the car seats that the stroller doesn't accommodate.Second, you have to remove the rear seat every time you want to fold the stroller. UGH. Once again, this isn't something you learn until you read the instructions.Third, this thing is HEAVY.We ended up returning it to the store and are still searching for something else, probably a side-by-side since they seem to be lighter."
5,Great for twins,"Fantastic for twins, I use it every day. The infant seats (graco snugride) attach easily and with no problems. We use the toddler seats occasionally now that the twins are older, and have no problems with them either. The car seat attachments are easy to install and use. The straps are sturdy, we have never been concerned about the seats and their safety.The seats can face any direction you like, which is nice when you need to calm the babies down.The stroller is light, I can fold it and lift it with one hand. I'm pretty petite and not strong at all, and have no problems carrying this by myself.It is very easy to push, manuevers corners well, no problems getting in tight spaces.I love this stroller, can't say enough about it."
5,Very nice stoller,I bought it for my 2 years boy and my new born... I have to say that is very heavy.. but you will get used to it... beside that I liked a lot.. you can turn the seats around so your little ones can play together... i will recommend this product ....
2,So big it cant fit my 3 year old.,"This thing is so huge, it takes up my 3rd row in my mini van when i take it with us. it's seats are also to small to fit my daughters legs (and she is really short for her age) it also takes a litle time to unfold.Good for big trips like the zoo,when the kid gets warn out and wants to nap (kinda)but not something for every day. Be sure you have somewhere to store it."
2,three major issues,"I returned this stroller because b/c of 3 major issues:1. the car seat must be strapped in after snapping it into the adapter, and the adapter does not hold the car seat unless it is strapped in VERY tightly which is difficult to do. Our car seat almost slipped out on several occasions while walking on a bumpy path. The strap just adds one more step to the process of loading the kids in the stroller.2. The big kid seat(s) must be removed in order to fold the stroller flat enough to fit it in a standard trunk - I have a VW Passat with a large trunk and it barely fits. Again, one additional step in loading the kids into or taking them out of this stroller.3.The seat is too shallow and too short for my 30lb toddler. He barely fits and if he grows any taller he won't fit at all. This stroller is not designed for kids over 2."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I thought I might have problems getting around in the stores with this stroller, but I was amazed that I didn't have anymore difficulty than I did with my single seat stroller. I love that I can change the seating around to whatever configuration I need. Again I just LOVE IT!!!"
2,Keep shopping!!,"I bought this stroller for my two year old and newborn. I loved being able to change the seats around and it steers like a dream. Then, I had to put it in the car. To fit in the back of our minivan, I had to completely remove both seats. The fold down is awkward and lifting it over the Odysee's lip is nearly impossible. I read one review that had the weight listed at 40 lbs, but the shipping weight is 53 and I think it has to weigh 50 pounds. Our now almost 3 yr old weighs 24 lbs and the seats were not deep enough for her. After 2 months I found that I would rather carry the baby and chase the toddler than deal with this stroller, so I sold it and I am looking for a replacement."
4,Kolcraft tandem stroller,"The stroller is awesome. Drives well over rough terrain. It is heavy & large. You need a large trunk to carry it in. My only complaint is the bar for the seat. It should be a tray with a cup holder. After looking at the Graco, thinking maybe I should have purchased it."
4,I really like this stroller,"Having 5 children, I've used a lot of strollers. So far I like this one the best. It is the most versitile stroller I have ever used. My only complaint is that it's a little on the heavy side. Also my Seat2Go won't work on it (for my toddler). A buggy board probably won't either, but it does have 2 rubber handles for toddlers to walk next to the stroller.My twins are 22lbs and 1 yr old and they fit in the seats just fine. Everything on this stroller, just about, is adjustable. The price is very reasonable for what you're getting."
5,Perfect for twins,I am very happy with this stroller.. It fits easily in the back of my trunk.. I bought an additional car seat attachment since the stroller just comes with one. I always just put the babies in the carseats and put them into the attachments on the stroller and we're good to go! It has a LOT of room at the bottom. Enough to store the diaper bag and my purse (and bags if you are shopping)!! I keep my keys and phone in between the cup holders (bottle holders). I would highly recommend. Just remember to light the handle bars UP before trying to close the stroller.
3,Contours Double Stroller,"I was excited about buying this stroller because I thought it had everything I wanted. When I started pushing my 2 month old son in it, I realized the canopy wasn't covering him in the layed back position. The sun was in his face almost constantly. When I pulled it forward the back flapped open and the sun was in his face again. Very frustrated with the canopy. I wish it extended much more, so I'm going to have to buy an extender to add on. Other than that easy to push and everything else I expected."
4,got space,"I t is heavy, but your kids are going to have space.They love it!I hope you have space in your car, make sure."
2,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Wireless (or switch) sucks horribly. Tons of issues with it dropping connection. Driver for wireless incredibly limited. Charger died out in months and Sony refused any warranty repairs on unit unless I provided my original receipt, credit card statement and other documentation (and I purchased this on an air force post). I would not buy this system again. When it works it works fine. But if I could do it again I would have waited and bought a Dell, HP, emachines - anything but this. Heard Sony made decent systems and had good support, boy was that a lie. I'll stick with Dell."
2,Not impressed at all...,"Bought this laptop in April of 2007. As other reviewers commented it does look very sleek, however there are many issues with it. First of all after using it for almost 2 years I have 4 minutes of battery life. 4 minutes. It is ridiculous that I am a slave to my power cord. Second of all, it is so slow. I do not have many additional programs loaded onto this computer but it takes forever to load up a program. The internet frequently crashes as does Windows Media Player. Recently I've had to restart my computer several times a day because of the crashes. I thought it might be a virus so I swept it using an anti-virus program but nothing was wrong. I wish I had chosen a different laptop, this one is very disappointing."
3,"Do what it is supposed to do, I would buy a cheaper one next time...","Regarding the product, It does what is supposed to do, but with the Barlow attached there is too much ""flare"" (not sure if this is the correct term).Positive point: the barlow can be removed. And can be used with other eyepieces.Celestron Customer services is terrible. They take a long time to answer and dont provide even the simplest information replying:""As a policy we cannot provide such information."""
5,New Spin on an Old Idea,"For years I've been challenged to read a chapter of proverbs every day and repeat it each month. (Read Chapter 1 on the 1st of the month, chapter 2 on the 2nd of the month, etc). This allows you to focus a little more slowly but more deeply on the truths. You focus on just a little bit each day but the extra devotioanl thoughts help you apply and personalize the truths more deeply."
4,High Voltage for DVD,"Now this movie had bad acting, and bad music, but did it deliver on action ! The shootouts in this movie seem straight out of Hong Kong. If you want to see a ""B"" movie with ""A"" Quality shootouts then this is for you. ( When did Bruce Lee's daughter look so good)?"
2,OKAY,I am a fan of Antonio's but I will speak frankly - this movie was cheesy. It was okay. It is always a thrill to see that hunk -- and an extra thrill to see his father (Good Lord! He is more built than his son! WOW!)-- but the movie was not very good. Sorry-- it's really only for hard core Antonio fans. What's with the marriage scene! That was lame! But overall it is okay.
1,What a Joke...,"Pitiful casting, dreadful action scenes, abysmal dialogue, and the worst storyline I've seen in a long time. Scenes in the apartment (the action scenes) have someone giving a grunt to let you know that the shooting's about to commence:grunt: bang, bang, banggrunt: bang, bang, banggrunt: well, you get the idea.MST-3K would have had a ball with this film: wait, did I call this a film? Doesn't even come in 5.1, and the shots sound like balloons popping.""Are you staying?""""Perhaps""""Can I get you anything?""""If I want anything, I'll let you know.""So happy that I got this from Netflix and didn't invest anything. So bad, it's hilarious, hence the one star--for laughable moments."
3,Not quite what it purports to be,"My initial impression was that this was going to be a serious work about historiography. Instead, it is more of a personal journey to confront the issues of guilt, memory, and reconciliation. Yes, there are many thought-provoking interviews and recollections, but the author is clearly too close to the subject and it affects her objectivity at times. I was hoping for a more serious study. It's not bad for what it is, however, its just more of an Oprah's Book Cub book and less of a book you might want for, say, a graduate school course."
1,Didn't make the most of my time!,"I was pretty excited when I read the title. Finally, a book that would help me figure out all the gadgets that accompany my sewing machine and serger! Unfortunately, this book was not the answer. It didn't provide any information on presser feet that I couldn't find in any sewing notions catalog. The rest of the book contained home sewing projects with instructions that applied to sewers who own Elna machines. I wish I had known that before I ordered the book!"
4,Works fine,"The mic holder works fine--although it does slip on a slim mic. Fixed this with a couple of rubber bands. Muffles any vibration sound, keeps the mic where you point it, what more could want?"
2,inferior quality compared to other Maisto models,I generally love Maisto Assembly Line models and buy them for my 9-year old daughter; have 5 of them overall. This particular model is inferior to other models as far as quality of pieces and their matching. My daughter actually insisted on leaving this comment for other people to know.
4,A fond return...,"Shared worlds often suffer from the problem of a major theme emerging and all the stories turning to that theme, even if that means sacrificing something along the way. Somewhere around the sixth book or so of the Thieve's World series, I felt that some of what I enjoied most about the stories had been lost as an overall story arc developed.When I bought Sanctuary, I was not optimistic, but I remembered the early stories fondly enough to take the risk. Boy, am I glad I did! Not only did I enjoy the book once I got into it, but the flashbacks to Sanctuary's past make me think that I should go back a read all the stuff I mssed in the original series."
2,bulova alarm,"This Bolova watch has an attractive appearance. The alarm feature however, is so faint that it could not be heard unless one pressed it to one's ear. I bought the watch because of the alarm but had to return it because for me the alarm was inadequate."
4,"No joke, this is truly worth four stars.","What a fantastic album. Volume Three of the Zimbabwe Frontline series offers an intriguing glimpse into the world of Zimbabwean music during the mid 90's. Featuring the reggae-inspired tunes of John Chibadura, the always-danceable band The Four Brothers, the mbira-inspired work of Max Mapfumo and Knowledge Kunyati, and guitar and bass extravanganza of the Zimbabwe Cha Cha Kings, the album is guranteed to make you move. Zimbabwe Frontline Three is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in guitar-based African music, and is a great choice for the first-time buyer. No joke, this CD is truly worth four stars."
4,Speaking of Love/With Love From Hollywood,A delightful compilation of songs sung by two excellent singers.Favourites since I acquired the initial LPs this release givesa bonus by providing some of the tracks in Stereo. Thoroughlyrecommended to anybody who enjoys this type music.
5,Joey' fav movie!!,This was one of the best investments! My grandson loves this movie! Hope to get some more of the other episodes also! The best price around too!
3,Okay but nothing great.,"My son enjoyed playing this game, but my wife and I were disappointed by how little there was to it. It claims to be educational and teach ""life lessons,"" etc., but the claims are pretty bogus. If you want a game that's moderately entertaining and innocent for your kids, go for it. If you really are looking for something that will teach, don't try this one."
3,It is ok.,"It's a fun game that is for sure! My son is enjoying it but I think it is better for a younger child, at least in our case.There is only one game to really play and the story line is the stame all the way through. So after the third time my son was kind of bored with it. But it is really neat how it is set up. I wish there were more like this with a bit more of a challenge!"
5,"Kitty Wells CD ""Dust on the Bible""","This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon.com, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I will have to say that the service was excellent! I had a hard time finding this CD and was very pleased with the quality. Both the selection of songs on the album and the quality of the recordings were very good."
3,very secure,"Very good, fantastic metal cover for your fragil ipod, BUT when you put the ipod inside the jacket you loose your ""necklace"" (because the ipod's bottom must goes out). I'm also concern about the ipod ""USB connection"" is exposed (the jacket's bottom is opened-I just dont know why!!)."
5,A great album!,"I highly recommend this album of Daniel O""Donnell's. The man truly has such a beautiful voice. The song selection is lovely and this album is well woth getting and deserves all of the stars it can get. It's truly beautiful!"
1,Where is it?,I ordered the Greatest Hits CD (Daniel O'Donnell on March 18th it was to ship in April it is now July 29th I have not received the cd so it is hard for me to rate or review
1,Vegas here we come,"I bought this disk very cheap used as it's out of print. I was on a very short Dorian binge. I recovered rather quickly. I did find a few good disk. I thought ""Crossroads of the Celts"" and ""Celtic Wanderers"" are fine recordings. No doubt there are others that I would like. But this recording reminds me of all that I dislike about the Dorian label. It just all so over the top. If you can imagine someone doing a Los Vegas show of early music you may get some idea of how distasteful this cd is. Think Elvis in his late years. Think a large stage with smoke and mirrors and lots of flashing lights and scantily clad dancing. I think I need a drink.There are far better recordings of this type of music that are much more satisfying on every level."
2,Breaks easily,I've had two of these and both are broken now. Screws that hold EP in place break or loose threading really easy.
1,"A little better than the first, but still bad...","Karinka brings a little more light to the series (since they already dulled Saki's character down to nothing) but this is pretty much a lost cause. The characters don't get any more interesting, the last minute addition of the mystics seems bizarre rather than a throwback to the old series, and the ending is terrible. I kept hoping that what I thought would happen wouldn't, but it did. What a cop-out. Burn your money and write a fanfic."
3,Nice Adaptor,it does the job as explained in the descriptionI have connected my Canon 40D to Celestron C90 using Celestron 93635-A T-Adapter and Adorama T-Mount for Canon EOS.I took nice photos for the moon :)
5,Fram PH8170 Oil Filter,"It's an oil filter for my vehicle. It fits, it works. It doesn't leak. It's all good. I would highly recommend it."
5,Fits Husqvarna YTH2348,"This fit my Husqvarna YTH2348 with the 23HP Briggs & Stratton Intek V-Twin OHV Engine. Works like a champ.Boring Story: It took me 20 minutes, a plethora of tools, and skinned knuckles to remove the stock Briggs and Stratton oil filter from my mower. The whole time, I was cursing at the print on the original oil filter that stated ""Finger Tighten Only"". I guess Briggs and Stratton had Hulk Hogan working the assembly line that day.I put a little oil on the rubber seal of the Fram filter, finger tightened it, and there are no leaks. Works like it should."
3,Good low end filter,"A little light in the construction and cheaper internals - but still a good, cheap filter."
5,Perfect fit,I have heard that you can get a filter that will fit at the auto parts store but why risk it? You don't have to change it that often so why not go with the real thing. I think it is cheaper if you get all the parts together as a kit.
3,Magic and Hype demystified,"The author succinctly relates the past to emerging interfaces in the library of future. Such a futuristic dimension is best reflected in the last chapter, i.e., Giving up Prophecy. Billings has summarized, in this collection, his extensive experiences, and presented a summum bonum of his 25 years career - from grassroots to the bureaucratic heights, building infostructures that sustain any hurricane. Herein, intangibles are so nicely presented that even a novice in the field does not have to re-read the text or find much left for imagination. His thought provoking essays challenge information professionals to accept needed change. He is of the view that those who forget history will be forced to repeat it.Given the strength of the book as a good assessment of successful ventures in information-sharing I recommend it to practitioners in academic / research libraries, as well as, library schools."
2,Dreamweaver 3 book review,"I'm sorry to disagree with the others who have reviewed this book, but as a new web person, I do not feel this book is up the the other fine dummies books out there. I'm back on line now to search for another one that will go into more detail of why and what I'm doing."
3,"Great photos, so-so text","Visually great, wonderful to see so many Easter island pieces in one place. However, text has a lot of errors, many Rapanui words are misspelled. The reference list is so selective that most important references are not listed.Most who read the text probably will not know the difference. Advice: look at the pictures, skip the text."
3,Excellent photos and good overall info,"I purchased a couple of wood figures (moai) from Easter Island recently, and then ordered this book in order to learn more about the artistic traditions of this remote island. This small folder presents the most important types of artifacts from Easter Island, and includes some brief but good information on its history and tribal traditions. All the designs, whether they be wood, stone, or barkcloth, are striking and unusual. Recommended for all readers interested in art from the Pacific Islands."
3,Along way from Sparky's garage,Templeton blends catchy rhythms with awe-inspiring lyrics. A perfect Cd to relate to when feeling down. Forerunners of the Columbus music scene.
3,overrated,"Not as good as his Blue Horizon output. You wouldn't even know Peter Green attended the sessions, if the sleeve didn't mention him. I bought this to complete my Peter Green collection & have barely played it. You have to be in the mood for piano music. Some songs feature Eddie only. Would recommend trying the Complete Blue Horizon Sessions of both Eddie Boyd & Otis Spann first."
3,Chunky,"This book by its size is obviously meant as a pocket guide, but at over 700 pages will be a snug fit in most pockets. A quick glance shows that its illustrations consist of full-page line-drawings. These drawings show the general appearance of a flowering or fruiting twig and some highlighted relevant details: flowers, fruits, leaf scars, etc. Considering the overall size the drawings would seem to be of decent quality."
5,Lovely,"I needed something subdued and warm for me and my husband's bedroom. This poster is perfect, inexpensive, placed in a nice frame, warms up the formerly blank bedroom wall."
2,Size,What was I thinking? I did not check the size and now I have a gigantic version of a poster I really like. I'll have to try to order again and pay better attention.... Mea Culpa:-(Pamela Olson
2,Don't Bother to Pay for the Framed Portrait,"I ordered the 1.25 black framed print. I just received this & the poster is bubbling inside of the frame. I expected much better quality for a $50.00 dollar framed poster. To call this ""professionally framed"" is false advertising. I could have purchased the poster alone & framed this myself for half the price & I could have made it look much better. In fact, I am sending this back now. It's also worthwhile to note that the thumbnail picture shown in the search results for this item does not have the same color scheme as the picture shown on the item's actual page. Consider yourself warned & don't get scammed by this seller.On a more positive note, I would like to commend the seller for doing an excellent job of packaging this item."
