5,One Of 2Pac's Greatest CD's,"This CD is so good. I bought this a while ago, and I still listen to it. Its a good CD to cruise around to, and to play ball with."
5,This is my favorite album of all time,"2Pac is one of the best rappers of all time if not the best. This album stands out as his greatest in my opinion. There are great songs not only on disc 1 but also disc 2 allowing both discs to be listened to. A lot of the songs on 2pac's greatest hits come off of ""All Eyez On Me"" and that proves that this is a great CD. Anybody that likes rap should purchase this masterpiece and most likely won't be disapointed by the album. Trust me on this one, if rap is your style and this CD isn't in your library put it in there and love what others already have and still do."
5,MAKAVELI DA DON TIL I'M GONE...AND THEN ON AND ON...,"Sorry guys, ALL EYEZ ON ME, is only the second greatest album of all time, falling only to the Makaveli album. ALL EYEZ ON ME, is made up of the tightest prodution you'll ever hear on a album. Tell me DeVante did'nt lay down the law or what 4 NO MORE PAIN. Daz, Johnny J, the cuban millitant, and eveyone else blessed the album to the highest degree. No one compares to Pac, our generation's great musical mind. Pac trancended Hip Hop. He brought enlightenment to the complicities of thugism. Don't hate him for his duplicity, that's what made him the GREATEST OF ALL TIME. p.s. tell me the production on LIFE AFTER DEATH didn't stink something terrible."
4,tha bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i think this is his best album but i cant give it 5 stars cause it aint just great i mean good yes but great no!!!!!!!!!!!
5,thug for life,like i was saying this is the phatteset joint and everyone should have this in their tape deck cuz for one pac is the stuff two pac was and is the realist rapper of all time. from the early days of 2pacylesses now to makaveli the seven day therory. you watched him grow from his first album into what I call the best rapper of all time. if you don't have this cd you need to have it cuz without it you ain't no tru rap fan so like i said go get this cd ya heard me.......
5,Pac at his Death Row finest,"All Eyez on Me is in a shell what Tupac expressed while at Death Row. Money, jewels, alcohol, and sex. While Me against the world might have been his most introspective album, and The seven day theory the most intense this is Pac in his Death Row phase at its best. So if you are a fan of Pac period go cop this album, it is great, and espically if you like his Death Row songs the best."
5,Thug Story,"All Eyez on Me is the first cd that Tupac recorded while on Death Row Records. From the start the producers Johnny J, Dr. Dre, and Daz provide the sonic for 2pac to verbally unleash on a variety of topics. From ""Ambtion Az a Ridah"" where 2pac takes on all challengers with to hometown love and pride ""California Love"" with Dr.Dre and personal reflection ""I ain't mad at you"" this two disc set is a must for all rap fans for opportunity to look within the soul of a truly great artist."
5,2Pac Still Rules!,I was looking to replace CDs I lost and this came in perfect time. I love 2Pac's music still.
3,What is your opinion?,"2pac's intellect was clearly of a high level- you can tell thisfrom the thought of his lyrics-----they spoke the truth, rather thanthe usual type of rap submitted by many rappers. This is clearly illustrated on this album. This album also gives 2pac a chance air his frustration at the negative energy of others. If you like dark rap, with fecculent language,then this album is perfect. You will particuly enjoy 'ambitionaz az a ridah' 'no more pain'. PUT YA MOUTH ON THA PISTOL he screams in 'no more pain'. Obviously an angry man as he had just been released from jail when recording began for the album. In conclusion this album ain't tha best from 2pac but still good!"
3,Pac has done better,"I'm a big fan of 2pac, so I don't want the three stars to seem like a negative review. This is a good album, and 2pac definitely brings it: gritty lyrics, passion, great beats, quite a bit of rage. However, as a double album there is a lot of filler, and when I play either disk in my car, I find that I can't listen to it over and over they way I can with Me Against the World.There are some very good songs throughout, starting from the get go with ""Ambitionz as a Ridah"", and ""Only God Can Judge Me"" is a masterpiece. Being a double album unfortunately inflates the price, but I still think it's worth buying. Just keep your stereo close when you listen to it, because you'll likely be using that skip button quite a bit."
5,best album ever made bar none,"c-bo, meth, 40, redman all made it the great big all time best. I love this album. All songs are great except whats ya phone number"
5,I LOVE TU PAC HE IS MY IDOL!!!!,I LOVE 2PAC SO SO SO MUSH HE INSPIRED ME THROUGH HIS POWERFUL WORDS AND HE IS FINE I LOVE HIS MUSIC MY MOM DOSENT BUT I LOVE IT SO SO MUCH HE IS SO NICE AND IF I EVER CAUGHT THE GUY WHO KILLED HIM I WOULD DO SOME DAMAGE I HATE THE GUY WHO DID THAT SO MUCH WELL THANK YOU 4 LISTENING TO MY REVIEW AND GET HIS CDS THE KICK
5,BEST OF DA WEST!,This album is DA BOMB DA BEST OF DA WEST TO DATE all of the songs is Phat and all have the best rappin you will hear anywhere! this album is the only thing which kept Death Rizzow alive his best album by far and if you dissagree you aint no Pac fan!
5,10 YEARS ALREADY!!!,"This album is probably the best album ever layed down in the history of rap. It is a timeless classic and will never be forgotten just like the player himself. He died ten years ago tommorrow, but it seems like just yesterday.R.I.P Tupac,FAN 4 LIFE"
2,Overrated but still very good!,"Personally, I don't think it's a 5mics classic album. But it has a lot of good tracks, good collaboz and more. But 25% are filler tracks like the weak ""What'z Ya Phone #"". I gave it 4 stars because it's a solid CD."
2,For Personal Reasons,"On every album of his I give him the same rating because I really didn't like Tu-pac. Every body on his jock but I don't see why. I mean he was a great artist, he had a couple of songs that I liked on this album but when he started to seem foney to me that's when I stopped liking him. Plus he is sort of the reason why my brother is dead right now(Biggie). Sorry to say I am not one of Tu-pac's fans ""like everyone else is"" but those are my reasons and for anyone who doesn't like my brother go to hell."

2,Did I get the same copy as everybody else?,"This ... was pretty weak. The beats were some of the worst I've ever heard, and 2pac's got a terrible flow. I really don't know what people see in this album. There's only like 10 good songs on this. I can't believe some people think this is the greatest album. This isn't even the greatest double disc."
3,Not what i expected,"Thought i was getting both cds didn't realize it was going to be just the first one, i have the first one that's why i bought it for the second one. Cant go wrong with a 2pac cd, just not what i expected."
5,"it's 2pac,what else should i say?",i was super excited to get this set to add to my collection. everyone loves a little 2pac. this is a great 4 piece set that is for sure to turn your lame party into a dance party.
5,do not order from caiman.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is prolly one of the best rap albums of all time. The lyrics are great and the beats are tight. But if your ordering it new do not order from caiman.com the products are damaged a lot. My cd has a lotta scratches on it and the case came cracked to. Peace.
4,This CD rules,"This CD is Awesome! 2pac's voice is mezmirizing! A must have for all rap fans! Almost all of the somgs are good and have a nice beat to dance to. Some songs are sad (Life Goes On), some are great to dance to (How Do U Want It?) others are just plain good (California Love, I aint mad At cha). Get this CD, it rules. And although 2pac is dead, his mustic will always live with us. RIP 2pac"
3,Good Not Great!!,"This album is a good album. The production is pretty good, the guest appearances go well with Pac( Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Outlaws, Daz, Kurupt) and Pac maintains a decent flow. However his subject matter on this album strays from a more focused and serious Pac to the full fledged thug. The subject matter of All Eyez on Me does not equal up to the level of his previous efforts such as Me Against the World, and 2Pacalypse Now. Once again, a pretty good album for beats and to bump in the car, but Pac left the focused, thought provoking lyrics in exchange for the thug."
4,2 Pac's Back !,This two Cd Set is a must buy for 2 Pac fans !!! It has 27 songs in total and brings Tupac Shakur back to his best form. Long live Makaveli. 2 Pac is rocking da house !!
3,"Good, but not 'Pac's best.","All Eyez On Me is a fly album, but it's not as good as Tupac's first three albums. Compared to his masterpiece, Me Against The World, this is not that good. It still contains some gems though. We got classic cuts like ""California Love"", ""I Ain't Mad At Cha"" and ""Got My Mind Made Up"" (an ill possecut with Redman, Method Man and Tha Dogg Pound), but then again we also have boring songs like ""No More Pain"" and the horrible ""Check Out Time"".So, if you haven't got any of Tupac's albums, I recommend you buy Me Against The World, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z or 2Pacalypse Now before you buy All Eyez On Me. If you already have those albums, then you should look in the bargain basket for this album. It's not really worth full price."
1,Very bad release,All Eyes on me is a simble of what tupac's style was after getting out of jail and i guess he wanted the anttention from thw world but he didn't impress me with this album cause I've never really was into his music due to the fact that it wasn't that good but that just my opnion and millions others.
1,hes amateur at best,"oh cmon anyone can write rhymes if they spend hours and hours..get life after death or any of BIGs material if u want real rap..BIG didnt write any rhymes, str8 off the top of the dome..BIG is the Greatest to ever do it..pac is a joke and always will be..the fool is probly alive and he still cant match BIG..BIG was flat out better and you all know it..BIG FOREVER"
1,will smith,2pac is a a terrible rapper who pretends to be gangster. If you want to listen to a real thug with good music listen to will smith.
5,I love tupac!!!,Tupac is the best rapper of all time...hands down! This is one of the first tupac albums that I ever owned. It in my opinion is also the best to date.
5,Makaveli tha don,"This album is classic. Songs like Got My Mind Made up, all about u, and how do u want it, make this album a must have. If you want a collection all classic production, then this album is for u."
4,22s,"plain and simple......................the essential! 4 ever if u dont have this cd in ur collection, ur losen in the rap game! i dont care if u listen to bitch ass rappers like puff or lil wyte. All real rap collectors need this. So crack a beer light a splig LISTEN. It all makes sense!"
5,The Amerikaz Most Wanted,This one's on the top 5 albums of all time list. 2 discs full of classics from the fallen soldier. How long will we mourn him?
5,His best album EvEr!,"Tupac has shown his true fans what rap means, he is my favorite rapper and god bless his soul! he will be remembered and love from relatives, family, friends and fans. You will really enjoy this cd."
5,give it an extra 100 stars,"That's 105 stars. Yeah, this is the greatest cd of all time, no matter what type of music. This is the greatest mc of all time on his best ever cd. There isn't a song on here that I wouldn't put among the greatest tracks of all time. He has features from the Outlawz, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, KCi & JoJo, and others. Like I said, all the tracks crack, but the top five are Ambitions Az A Ridah, 2 of Americaz Most Wanted, Picture Me Rollin, When We Ride, and Life Goes On. If you don't have this, go get it, I don't care if it's 2 in the morning and you gotta break into Sam Goody to jack it. GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!"
1,Got half the cd!,"When both cd's are advertised I assume I get both, guess not. Amazon I want half my purchase price or the other half of my cd."
3,Strong entry for his catalog,"Tupac did not get the love that he gets now while his career was blowing up...a true poet, who expresses feelings not seen in most rappers or poets."
5,One word: CLASSIC!!!,"What's there left to say? Simply one of the greatest albums of all time. Pac recorded this in like two weeks, unreal. Buy it, steal it, borrow it and never give it back, do whatever you gotta do."
2,blah,If you ask me Tupac is very talented but i'm not really feeling this album I flet that his other one's were better.
3,Good but NOT GREAT,"Being a Pac fan from Digital Undeground and his days in Juice, I can honestly say this album was a success because of the circumstances around it.2Pac had just got out of jail. There was high curiousity on what he was gonna do or profoundly say. The answer wasn't much.Most of the best songs, with the excepttion of Checkout Time and Skandalouz, made it to the airwaves. The other half was just filler. (Do like I did and burn it to a single disc for maximum enjoyment).Lyrically, it's the same Cali-stuff, cars and ""ridin"". The beats make this album. After all, the duet with Snoop and Dre is what most remember. However, there's a few here and there that sound recycled. So..There you have it. An HONEST and fair All Eyez On Me review, beside just repeating how great Pac is. Thanks for reading. :)"
5,Classic,"All I gotta say that this is a classic, I mean I've been a fan of Tupac since he dropped his first cd, and now when I pop this in the cd player almost 10 years later after it dropped, it still is better then most of what is out there today. Thats why I consider it a classic. Ya some may say that Tupac is overrated, and that his lyrical skill isn't that good. Ya and it maybe tru, but Tupac is a leader with his words, the content of his lyrics and how he expresses his pain, is something that a lot of people can relate to. Tupac was more than a rapper, was one of the most influentual person that rap music has known for a long time."
4,Hip Hop Genuis,This not 2pac's best album or even is best work. but it still stands as one of the grestest Hip Hop albums of all times. Is mixture of trash talking the East Coast and still bringing the messege to the community is umatch by any MC of his times!! R.I.P 2pac!!*L* ~
5,Awesome,This album is the best on the rackz of amazon.com or any other store in the USA!!!! I love this cd. It sums up all of his talents onto 2 disqs. If you don't have any 2Pac cds start wit this one. That's what I did...
5,Impact Of Importence ... Pure Entertainment,"Dang has it been three years since this album was released ? Well it may not seem so , but it has been .Full of twenty seven tracks with production from Daz Dillinger , Dr. Dre , Johny ""J"" , and Devante' Swing . The first disc is full of nothin but hits , after hits , after hits . It spawned three to four hits by itself and if this was a one cd set , the first disc by itself would have gone 5 times to six times platinum . The second disc is almost as as good and may seem a little repetitive , but it is full of hit material as well . No single was released from the second disc , but why should he when the first disc is full of potential hits . Also on top of the ""California Love "" single going three times platinum , this album sold ten million copies . That's right , ten times platinum . Go cop this album . Who cares how old it is . No other album has beed able to touch the consistency that this album did over two discs ."
5,The Paul McCartney of rap music,"2Pac is probably one of the greatest entertainers to come in a long long time. He has turned around rap in alot of ways. Nobody else can rhyme like this guy. He is stunning. All Eyes On Me is perhaps his greatest album he came out with. Their are elements on this record that are still bizarre and amazing. It would be amazing if anybody else could catch up with this. Its so good. But it probably wont. 2Pac is just like the Beatles. Their will be no other rapper out there who can become as good as he can. Not Master.P, Juvenile, Puff Daddy, nobody. A definete must buy."
2,tupac first album after leaving jail for death row records,"It was sad that tupac was incarcerated in jail and that he was abused also but in this album he showed everybody that it was not going to get to him and he took out his frustration on other artist including the record label Bad Boy. I listen to this album and I now understand why pac was so upset at his music mates. To sum it all all eyes on me was a dramitic album about the time that pac was going thru and what happens when you turn on a whole coast. It's sad what happened in jail to pac,but pac knew that he was gonna keep his head up and roll over his past and continue making music to make money for his label"
4,"Great album, just cut down on the background divas.","This is one of 2pac's better albums. The only thing wrong with it I can think of would be the excessive poppiness of it, especially on singles like 'California Love'. I could do without the 'shake, shake, shake'...makes me wince every time I hear it. Otherwise, it's chock full of interesting lyrics that cover just about any topic. The music is what you'd expect from well produced, mid-90s g-funk, and I like that...especially on the track with E-40 on it."
5,Goz 2 show Pac can't be replace or even matched,"This is, without a doubt one of the, if not, the best rap album of all time. A few songs off this Double disc CD have been sampled like ambitionz az a rhidah(Cam'ron leave me alone)(Fabalous Y'all can't deny it(Hook)), I ain't mad acha(Blackstreet Don't leave me) All eyes on me(Nas street dreams). But those songs weren't better than Pac's songs. My favorite songs are, Anbitrionz az a rhidah, All bout u, Got my mind made up, How do u want it, 2 of Amerikaz most wanted, No more pain, Heartz of men, life goes on, California love, I ain't mad acha, U can't c me, Shorty wanna be thig, wonder why they call u..., All eyes on me, ain't hard to find, and heaven ain't hard to find. Some of the other songs are good too, but not as good as these in my opinion, but if u don't have this album, u gotta check it out and see why pac's the greatest.Peace out"
5,All Eyez On Him,"I don't need to say much abut this one, exsept everyone who still hasn't bought it or is new 2 rap this is a important record for your collection. 2 discs of mind blowing beats, flows, lyrics. Is has it all. No songs to skip, of course some songs are better than the other. No weak material here and that's unbelievable for being a double disc. This will go down as one the best records ever. If you want rap lyrics visit : www.ohhla.comDefinitely recommend this for the collection if you don't have it yet. Is has plenty of guest and much stuff you can't bump at a party, in your car, at your system wherever you want. If fits everywhere! Be sure to check out ""Ressurection"" the soundtrack when it drops.One."
5,Pure Classic,"This is the best rap album ever. 2pac's best work features classics like ""California Love,"" ""2 of Americaz Most Wanted,"" ""Ambitions az a Ridah"" and ""All Eyes on Me."" Both discs are great. Worth the price and if your a fan of rap you won't be let down."
5,Read this,"2pac in general puts poetry to beats, albeit with a large amount of profanity. Regardless, this CD truly is awesome. Seriously. The songs on here like ""we aint hard to find"" are lame because I hate to hear 2pac rap about killing instead of loving. On the flip side, how many other rappers dedicate songs to other men (life goes on) and make it sound beautiful, while keeping a ""ghetto edge?"" None. ""When you see me you better holla at me"", even if you ""Can't C Me."" 2pac r.i.p."
5,IT IS AWSOME,"ALL EYEZ ON ME IS AN AWSOME CD. ALL OF THE SONGS R GOOD. MY PERSONAL FAV IS WHEN WE RIDE. U CAN LISTEN TO IT AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY. MORNING NIGHT OR DAY. WHEN YOUR FALLIN ASLEEP OR JUST WAKIN UP. ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK OR JUST CHILLIN IN YOUR LIVIN ROOM. ITS GOT SONGS FOR EVERYONE. HARDCORE GANGSTER, MILD REG. RAPS. AND SOME WHAT SLOW SONGS (HOW DO U WANT IT). SO I RECAMEND GETTING THIS CD."
5,Amazing.,"This album is my favorite album of all time. I decided to purchase the album rather than just download the songs because I wanted to have something to hold on to and take with me everywhere this world takes me. I definitely recommend this album to any Tupac, or rap fan, it is definitely more than worth it's cost even after 15 years of its release. Keep supporting amazing quality music and artists."
5,Great Album By The Greatest Man In Hip Hop!,"All Eyez On Me is a classic album by the late Tupac Amaru Shakur, even though there are 2 tracks that i really didnt like that much (California Love Remix & Whatz Ya Phone #) i think this is an album that every Hip Hop fan should have. It's very sad how kid's nowadays get ""inspired"" by artist like Lil Wayne,Kanye West or Drake, and even compare them to the late 2Pac and to other Legends of Hip Hop. It's incredible how Pac could make 3 powerfull classic in a row (Me Against The World,All Eyez On Me & The Don Killuminati The 7 Day Theory).thankz 4 the good music you left to us.R.I.P. Makaveli The Don"
5,LYRICAL GENIUS,"TUPACS ALL EYEZ ON ME ALBUM IS DEFINATELY A CLASSIC ITS NOT HIS GREATEST TEACHING BUT IT IS HIS GREATEST WILD SIDE CD. PEOPLE LATELY HAVE BEEN COMPARING 50 CENT TO PAC BUT ITS NO COMPARISION. MAD PROPS TO 50 BUT ALL HE REMINDS US OF IS PACS THUG SUPER EGO WE MUST NOT FORGET PAC WAS ONE OF THE MOST POLITICAL PEOPLE OF HIS TIME THATS WHY I URGE EVERYONE TO HEAR HIS EARLIER WORKS AND CHECK OUT HIS NEW MOVIE. RIP TO A POET, A THUG AND ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE MEN TO EVER LIVE. TRACK NINE LIFE GOES ON IT HELPS ME TO COPE. PEACE"
5,ALL EYEZ ON ME --- THEY STILL ARE,"THIS CD IS ANOTHER CLASSIC RECORD BY THE INFAMOUS 2PAC/MAKAVELI. THIS 2CD SET FEATURES OVER 25 SONGS (27 TO BE EXACT) THAT NEED TO BE HEARD. IF YOU CAN'T FIND THIS CD ANYWHERE, YOU CAN GET THE ""DIGITALY REMASTERED"" VERSION, WITH THE ""2 OF AMERIKAZ MOST WANTED"" VIDEO. THIS CD SHOULD ALSO BE PICKED UP IF YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE. I HONESTLY ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN TO DISC 2 BEFORE DISC 1, BECAUSE DISC 2 EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT LIFE, DISC 1 EXPLAINS ABOUT DEATH ROW FEELINGS. BUT WHATEVER. BUY IT WHEN YOU CAN."
5,"tha best there was,tha best there IS,and tha best 4 ever","Tupac Shakur is my best rapper,musician etc.His album ""All eyez on me""was the first I heard.all eyez on me is tha only double cd with no intro or interlude.it gives you about 27 tracks of quality lyrics by just one man.compare it to life after death which is just a party album with no true sense.this cd should be used to rate other hip hop albums as a tribute to this genius(2pac)."
5,Makaveli is born,"this album has no flaws. it's the bible of the rap industry. I think that Makaveli:7 day theory is the only other album that is slighty better than All Eyes On Me. before this album, 2pac dominated the rap game, but this album put him in a whole new league. U can't step to Pac's deep lyrics and poetic flows covering the album. The rap game won't be the same without Pac, and i have never gotten sick of this album in the 4 years that i've had it. It's just one of those albums that just knocks u off ur feet. If u like rap or even if u don't, pick this one up. U can't be dissapointed. Period."
5,A Definitive Album in Hip Hop,"2Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" stands out among countless other hip hop albums as a classic, and for good reason. It's very hard to make a 27 track album consistently enjoyable, but 2Pac did it. While there are some tracks that aren't as great as others, even those songs are light years better than anything out now. I've owned this album for years and manages to get heavy play to this day. Legendary album from a legendary artist."
4,These 4 stars are just for the first cd.,"I think if they would just release the first cd of this album, it would have much more succes. The first song ""Ambitionz Az A Ridah"" is not so good, but is is followed by a couple of exellent songs: ""All About U"", with Dru Down, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Nate Dogg, then again Nate Dogg on ""Skandalouz"", and ""Got My Mind Made Up"" with Daz & kurupt and Method man & Redman. Then on the same cd, there's ""2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" with Snoop... this song is one of the best on the cd with ""California Love"" featuring Dr. Dre. The second cd is not so good, I don't know what to say about it.. :)Peace."
4,NOT A Classic It's Made Out To Be,"All Eyez On Me. Often called Pacs greatest work. His Magnum Opus! Definetely not the case. It has so much filler, and does things that most artists are criticized for nowadays, has WAY TOO MANY GUESTS!!!! And they add nothing to the album. Only Method and Redman were any notable features. Also Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg. Otherwise, everybody was a huge waste of space. Lyrically it wasn't always on point either and quite frankly this was his worst album easily. His older political stuff was much better and far more inspiring. This album was great to listen to but when brought up against all his other albums, this is considerably weak... Not a bad album at all, but not a classic by any means."
2,a dissapiontment...not a classic like lil jon's crunk juice,"2pac is alrite but lil jon is a lyrical genious. 2pac didnt rap about any thing good he just rapped about money, and bling bling, and his hoes...lil jon raps from his heart his rhymes are pure genious..i also recommed fabulous..fabulous is a real gangster 2pac really wasnt at all a thug... all he did was start beef with other not so good rappers... this album is a dissipointment from deathrow...DEATHROW TOP ALBUMS..DPG dogg food, JEWELL, and kurupt....DEATHROWS MAJOR DISSAPIONT ABLUMS WERE DRE AND THE CRONIC, SNOOP AND DOGGYSTYLE(PRETTY BAD LYRICS) AND THEN TUPAC WITH ALL EYEZ ON ME WHICH IS THE BIGGEST DISSAPIONTMENT TO DEATHROW. I STONGLY RECOMMEND LIL JON WITH CRUNK JUICE RATHER THAN THIS BADLY PRODUCED AND NOT-SO-GOOD LYRICS CD."
5,T.U.P.A.C.S.H.A.K.U.R.I.S.A.D.O.P.E.,2pac have a most powerful rap style...... I like that too much...... his lyrics are so.......real.....so..tough.... dat's his own creative....... P.L.U.S........... 2.P.A.C. I.S 4.E.V.E.R.
5,More than o.j.,"Florida isn't just Disneyworld, you guys! And it's not just a place where all us New Yorkers go to retire. A lot of important history went down here, cultural and scientific institutions abound, and this book will tell your students about it.The ""Portrait of America"" series is a wonderful introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This ""Florida"" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The ""Culture"" section is especially good and is very inclusive.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."
3,No frills functional,"This feeder lasted me almost two years.Pros:- It has nice capacity.- I've had hummers fighting for a chance to use it.- Low price.- Did not leak, even after the base cracked (see below).Cons:- Low-grade plastic. Hanging in full sun, the clear plastic bulb yellowed within weeks. And recently, it developed an inch-long crack. It hadn't been dropped, but I believe the sun weakened the plastic over time. Also, the base cracked maybe a year ago at the spot where the bottle screws in (I didn't tighten it THAT hard).- Not easy to clean. The base has nooks and crannies inside that no brush seems able to reach.- Has to be overturned to fill. Which is a pain and means anything left in the bottom bowl will spill onto your hands."
2,Disappointing,"This was the worst of Poyer's books. When I had to resort to speedreading part of it, I knew it was going to be boring. He spent too much time on the tedious soul-searching self-pity and self-doubt end of it, and failed to supply enough action. He seems to be drifting into the same bog that Conroy fell into in his later books. Hopefully his next book will improve, but unfortunately I find this seldom happens."
2,Plot is a bit shaky,"Aside from being a boring read, the plot is also a bit hard to believe. The central character is working on a secret weapons project, but is allowed to hang-out with a group that has destroyed Naval property and is fighting the military, while at the same time he expresses his own doubts about Naval weapons programs.....would not fly in the real world."
2,"Illuminating, yet with glaring incongruities",The insights into weapon system development are fascinating. Yet a sub-plot and it's deriviatives require such a degree of naivety on the part of the protagonist and some of his associates made it difficult to suspend disbelief.
2,David Poyer turns left!,"""Tomahawk"" was a major disappointment to this fan of the Dan Lenson series. ""The Circle,"" ""The Med,"" ""The Passage,"" and ""The Gulf"" were outstanding and authentic, written with great skill by one who had ""been there, done that."" But it seems that Poyer underwent some sort of social/political rebirth just before writing ""Tomahawk,"" for the book is filled with a boring mish-mash of alcoholism, girlfriend woes, and Lenson's highly unlikely involvement with a radical pack of peaceniks out to sabotage the development of the cruise missile. Too bad, for this could have been a fine tale if it had been crafted in the style of the previous four books in the Lenson series. If you subscribe to turn-the-other-cheek pacifist theories, you might like this novel. Otherwise, save you money and your disappointment--this is NOT the Dan Lenson you knew and loved in the previous stories."
1,"If you believe this, I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge","One of the worst books that I have read.Nothing in the story seems real. The story about the missile is over 15 years old, but Poyer wants the reader to believe that it is set in the present time. The main character, Dan Lenson, is truly a work of fiction. Lenson is an alcoholic, developing a missile, falling in love with an anti-military freak and befriending her colleagues, saving the world from spies, etc.... Poyer's imagination is very vivid to have anybody believe that all of this could happen to one man.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,"Good, with some reservations","Overall, I liked this book, as I like the whole Dan Lenson series. Dan is not the typical hero of a military novel -- which is refreshing. He's basically a well-meaning doofus whose love life & career are invariably in the toilet. But he's good-hearted & he perseveres & he recognizes his own weaknesses. The plot & characterizations were good in this book, better than in the previous Dan novels. But, unfortunately, there's way too much techno-jargon. (I just skip over these parts.) ...if a naval officer ever behaved as Dan did in this novel, his career would be over, kaput. .... ...the novel makes it quite clear that it takes place in the '80s. I'll keep reading this series...."
3,What Happened to Dan?,I realize that Dan is mixed up. He was supposed to go to OP-O3 and ended up working on a cruise missile. He becomes sort of a wimp in the book and his choice of friends even for a lonely guy is not very smart. I am a retired Commander and grew up and worked and drilled in DC. It is unfortunate but true that if you want a successful career and you have a fairly high security clearance you really need to keep away from the groups like the one that Dan associated with. His senior officers understood this and cautioned him.The book IS fairly realistic. This scenario could happen to a Naval officer but not to a very smart one.Dan needs to go back to sea. He can't hack Washington.
5,"Crude, Vulgar, Funny!!!","This is a very funny show. It is similar in characters to The Office US but the language and obscenity is much more common in this one. I would only recommend this show to adults as the content is not suitable for children. If you like the US version, you will probably love this one too."
2,How things have changed.......,"I grew up on classic Britcoms like ""Yes Minister"", Are you being served"" and ""Fawlty Towers"". English creations of that era had a certain reserve but effective sense of humor.My expectation for the ""Office"" was similar; however, imagine my surprise to find otherwise. The humor is ""in your face"", crude, painful to watch and clearly beyond my generation. British humor appears to have changed.A bit of a disappointment....Update 2/9/08:I just finished ""the specials"" episode and found those two episodes very enjoyable. Excellent tying up of loose ends. I tried upgrading the review to 3 stars (from 2) but had Amazon does not seem to allow this."
3,Office Politics = Funny if it wasn't so true,"The Office has produced outstanding critic reviews, and with good reason. The show has been the freshest television comedy I have seen in quite a long time. Characters are deep and well written, especially David Brent (Ricky Gervais) as the boss that means well but self-destructs because he thinks too highly of himself. This comedic freshness was in part why I did not give this collection 5 stars. Although the first season DVD was hilarious, the next season, as well as the christmas special fell exceedingly short. After the first season it seemed that the show relied on the same cringe-worthy gags to produce laughs which grew increasingly predictable and boring. If you have watched a few episodes expect much of the same for the rest of the series. In fact, unless you want to see how The Office crew ends up expect most of the shows freshness to become repetitive."
2,Too painful to be entertaining,"The main character is such an unrelenting jerk that I wanted to get away from him just as I would in real life. I don't need to be reminded of all the horses rear ends that people have to work for. If you tend to really get into the programs you watch, you may find this one tedious and uncomfortable."
2,Disappointed!,"Normally, I love British shows. And I love the American version of ""The Office"". So, I expected to love this show even more. It starts out with funny bits, but soon becomes painful to watch. The characters, especially Ricky Gervais' David, are fairly unlikeable. By the end there is no one to root for, only a feeling of voyerism... like watching someone in a very uncomfortable and embarrassing personal situation. You feel sorry for them and almost hopeless. I am sorry I bought this set."
5,Funniest Ever,This is series is much funnier than the American version. Don't just get the First and Second Series without the Special. It is key!
5,Absolutely incredible,"I read one review on here that wasn't very complimentary. If you don't find The office funny, you simply just don't get it and I would suggest watching something like ""Friends.""The beauty of The Office is that it's subtle. It is not 'in your face' obvious humor. Actually, a lot of British humor isn't. I find American comedy a lot more obvious. The office is quite possibly (in my opinion) the best comedy ever written. You can identify with a lot of the characters and you can't quite believe what comes out of David Brent's mouth. Rickey Gervais is nothing short of genius. Not sure how many American awards The Office has won, but its won quite a few in the U.K and watching Ricky Gervais accept an award when he's in character is bloody hysterical!"
4,"Worth watching, but I still like the american version better","I have been a fan of the american Office for years. My favorite show of all time. Decided to give the British version a try. Took a while to get used to it. After a few episodes I really started to enjoy it. I still prefer the American version, but give this one a try as well."
2,Yawn - with a capital Y,"I have heard so many things about The Office. Let me start out by saing ""NO"" I have never seen the American version and ""Yes"" I love British comedy.I rented the first season after someone told me I had to see it.I watched the first episode and said -""It's going to get better.""The second episode I started taking down my Christmas tree and let the DVD play in the background because that was better than watching it.The third episode, the fourth, the fifth - more and more boring. YAWN!!!!None of it was funny. The two male co-workers who hate each other. The boss that thinks he's funny - and isn't but thinks he is -- how is that funny?The hot chick boss who oversees the un funny guy, Finchie - the receptionist - all so not funny.After reading a couple of reviews, I see I am alone in my opinion. So be it.Instead of wasting my time with this silly lot - I'll go find my Are You Being Served? DVDs and watch them.Mr. Humphries are you free?Yes, I'm free.(chuckle chuckle)"
2,The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special),"I did enjoy some of the episodes, but I like the American version better because they have so many more out takes."
3,Not so much,"I prefer the american version of the Office. The characters, specifically Dwight is much better in the US version."
2,I don't get it,"I found this unfunny and very slow moving. This must be a limey thing. The Brits, reportedly, don't get Seinfeld. I don't get this."
5,Starts slow but funny as hell,This series starts off slow and makes you go wonder if it's worth spending the time to watch...but do it. Because it is. Each episode is funnier than the last and you will laugh until you nearly pee your pants. The special has a great ending.
5,The Office BBC,"Rickey Gervais is the funniest man in the business. A forward, innovative thinker, with a great laugh. This original version of the current USA hit ""The Office"" is even more funny when you consider that many of the gags are copied right from the original series. We laughed through every episode."
5,Hilarious. Intimate,"Everything feels so real and raw.The opening shots show nothing but dreary looking office buildings with the blinds closed amid the grey morning sky.You've seen them. You may have ventured in, but you never want to work inside of In this mundane little world filled keyboard clickery. . . for years. . .Hours and hours and hours of copying things, inputting file informations, faxing, staring at screen savers. . .It is: ""the office""From a cubical-ridden hell that Gicky Gervai, Stephen Merchant created we get to know the personalities of many characters. Characters that we love AND hate=The Office Poster ~ Exclusive U.K Import ~ BBC Edition 24"" X 36""The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)They feel so real and raw. They strike that chord,Watch this show alone in the dark.Watch all of it. Don't skip the christmas special."
5,Awesome set,"This set is great. If you are a fan of the original series, then I highly recommend buying this set."
5,Best TV comedy since Seinfeld and The Simpsons,This is one of my favorite shows. Its a show that allows the audience to laugh and care about characters who are quite a bit more profund then those of the average tv sitcom. Highly reccomended.
4,Hurts Too Much,"This series is so great I can't watch it.We sometimes talk about passing a violent car wreck on the interstate and not being able to control the impulse to slow down and look. That's what this series is.People are suffering under the boss' virtually unconscious pursuit of leadership. His ineptitude, though, became way beyond unfunny to me when he tells an employee in front of an outside consultant, as a joke, that she's being laid off in a round of staff cuts.Her classy reaction is redemptive, but it was just way too real for me. There was a choice: continue to watch this wonderfully written and acted series, and suffer in the watching, or just quit. The DVDs have stayed in the box ever since.No harm no foul - it's a monumental achievement. And, if it has any chance of teaching managers the exactly wrong way to act, it might actually do some good somewhere. But I can't take it as comedy.Guess I need to toughen up some..."
4,Fantastic Series,"Speaking as an America, I think this version far exceeds the American version. This is the complete package, with all the British episodes and the special finale. Bloody hilarious."
5,Best series I've seen in a long while.,"The Office (Complete Collection) is the best combination of humor, drama, and ""reality"" I have experienced. It is unfortunate that it did not get more air time in the United States during its prime. It may take 2 or 3 episodes to grasp your attention, but after that I think we watched the whole collection in less than 2 weeks. We were completely overwhelmed at the genius of the writing, and we even watched all the extra features. One thing that is a must is to watch the series with the subtitles so we did not miss anything that sometimes would be missed due to British dialect. The American version of ""The Office"", while funny, does not do the original justice AT ALL. This would be a great Christmas gift for anyone, especially yourself!!!"
5,Friggin Funny Show,"This show is really one of the funniest, clever shows out there. Ricky Gervais is hysterical and he kind of reminds me of my own boss. If you like The Office w/ Steve Carrell, then you'll love this one. This one is the originator. It takes a minute to get used to the accents but after you jump that hurdle, it's all laughs from there."
5,Was a Great show,"This was a great show. If you like dark humor, you will love this show. Unfortunately, it did not run longer, but the DVD's make it live on. Definitely worth adding to your library."
5,Painfully funny...,"This show is a symphony. A perfectly constructed one, at that. The acting is spot-on and deadpan, as the cast maneuvers their way through one comedic/horrific scene to the next. The writing and directing for this TV comedy shines and lifts the product up to, dare I say, legendary status. Dare! Dare! Overall, this is one subtly brilliant television offering. This show, more than any other show that I've found (Seinfeld included) makes me want to watch its episodes over and over again - and never tire of them.The true power of the show lies in the fact that only 13 ""episodes"" exist. And what does exist feels volumes and volumes deeper than the total of 13 could ever communicate. In short, it never wears out it's welcome.Highly recommended."
1,Find something else,"The BBC Office and US Office are like body piercings. Lots of pain, a little novelty, but in the end they aren't art. This video is boring in the extreme."
2,British Humor Is Not For Me,"This show was highly recommended by a handsome chap I know named Liam. Like me, Liam is a prisoner of love. He swore up and down that this show was funny, but I just don't really get British humor or British people for that matter. Except Liam. He's got ""it"", whatever ""it"" is. This show however, does not have ""it."" I would still welcome the challenge of representing a British actor (or actress) at my PR firm.[...]"
1,Excruciating,"I looked forward to seeing this after reading four years' worth of reviews detailing the genius of the show. Maybe it's because I viewed it under tired, hormonal conditions, or was simply expecting something else--like to laugh--but one episode of this was enough for me. I'm off to watch something more high-concept, like ""Father Ted""!"
1,BBC OFFICE Review,"The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)Terrible! The main character is virtually impossible to understand his English.About got a headache trying to listen to his ""foreign"" language. Most other characters were tolerable. On a scale of one to ten, the u.S. version is a 10 and the BBC version is a 2. We watched three episodes and will not watch anymore!"
1,Holly Molly!,"I purchased the First Season and watched disks 1 & 2 (there are 6 in total). The rest of the disks (3 to 6) will not be viewed because it would be a waste of electricity, to power up my entertainment centre. Hydro is too precious to be floundered on this kind of tripe.Getting right to the point, I've never viewed anything as boring and lackluster as this show. All the characters are mundane and require acting lessons, in the worst way. There is absolutely no chemistry or spark that gels these bunch of rookie actors. The script and lines are neither funny nor entertaining. I was hoping to say one positive thing about the show but there isn't one to give you.Rather than burdening yourself by watching this lame show, do something constructive. Clean your toilet bowl or change the oil in your vehicle. You will have at least spent the time, worthwhile."
4,No difference in speed btw H and M for Fuji cameras,"I called Fujifilm technical support (1-800-800-3854, option #1) today and their tech support said there is no difference in speed between the H and M xD cards in-camera for Fuji cameras, including the F30, which is what I have. The Fuji rep also said that they do not sell Fuji H-speed cards in the U.S. for that very reason, and any cards sold in the U.S. are grey market, probably from Japan, and Fuji will not support these cards in the U.S. if they malfunction. Of course, Type H cards will be 2-3x faster once you take the card out of the camera, e.g., if you have a card reader and are downloading to your computer (but you will need to make sure your card reader reads H speed xd cards). Fuji did not think there would be a speed difference if downloading from your camera.Update: The above review was written in January 2007, and Fuji now sells high capacity Type H xD cards in the U.S."
5,Great memory card...excellent price!,"I bought this memory card in addition to a 512MB and 1GB Olympus cards I had. I wanted to get a high speed one for a change, and this one has been working great. Now i don't have to wait a while for my picture to load and i can work in burst mode without a problem. I work a retail store in South Florida and we sell the slow version of this (Type M) for $75 plus tax...needless to say, I was very happy getting mine here for total less than $65 and is high speed! Would recommend it if you can find it :-)"
3,Is not Fast. I have a trouble With This Picture Card,"I'm not clear but my Camera brand Olympus Just Don't work after insert this picture Card. Maybe was a desperpect of my camera, maybe was the picture card. Buy i 'm warning you about this picture card."
5,It does it's job!,"This card is beening used in a Fuji S6100 and it is plenty fast for this camera. Works great, would buy more!"
5,Santa Remembered,A beautiful collection of Santa Claus cross stitch patterns taken from antique post cards. Includes side-by-side photo's of the original postcard and the finished cross stitch project. The best illustration's of all the Leisure Art's Santa book serie's I've seen.
3,"Santa,Santa and More Santa","This 1989 book is pure Santa. From the introduction, with a well presented discussion of the evolution of the mythic figure through out history and religon to the current icon with a jolly laugh there is nothing but Santa in this book. And that isn't bad if you want a Santa book. However, all the portrayals are large scale portraits, and pictures. There are no ornaments, stockings, or Santa Remembered type of themes. No old time ornaments, toys or family scenes. On the plus side, each picture is beautiful, would make a family heirloom and is historically accurate to some period. There is a photograph and a short descriptive piece next to each figure that would be nice to include with the finished design if it is given as a gift."
1,Uncomfortable Chair,"This chair is very uncomfortable. It leans forward so that one feels as if one will slide out of the chair. At first I thought that this could be easily adjusted, but not so. I contacted HON customer service and they were useless. It's a sturdy chair, unfortunately the lack of adjustiblity makes it a pain to use."
3,Pretty Good... but could use some improvements,"I really like the size of this puppet. But should point out that you controlling both of Ernies arm's and mouth will require you to have 3 arms. The mouth also takes a surprising amount of force to open and close. The hand that controls the mouth will also get sweaty since that area does not breath.Visually, it looks great. For some extra fun, use Ernie's arm to slick back his hair. The hair, when brushed back, stays that way and it's funny to look at."
5,"Stand Ye Steady, West Point Cadet Glee Club","This is the famed West Point Cadet Glee Club at its very best. The DVD was taken at the Cadet Chapel with professional direction. The songs ""Into the Fire"", ""Via De La Rosa"", and ""Christmastide"" are particularly spectacular and uplifting. ""Mansions of the Lord"", a tribute to fallen soldiers, and now a standard piece with the Glee Club, is bitter-sweet. The DVD was recorded in 2005, and the cadets featured are now leading our young men and women through harm's way in the Middle East. The music is somewhat spiritual at some points but very uplifting. Director Connie Chase has done a wonderful job bringing the traditional and popular music of the Glee Club into the 21st century. This a DVD that can be viewed over and over by anyone with pride in America."
4,Excellent Performance,"The USMA Glee Club is a great performance group. Taping this performance in the West Point chapel was a very nice touch. The acoustics in that chapel must be marvelous, judging by the sound here.For anyone who appreciates inspirational music, this is a keeper."
5,Top-notch recording!!!,"The West Point Glee Club has a winner. This is a great collection of songs, using the Glee Club alone or with a soloist, plus excerpts from speeches of great West Pointers like General Douglas MacArthur. The sound technicians did a superb recording job as well. This DVD is definitely a keeper. I shall listen to it many, many times. My favorite is Ms. Lea Salonga and the Cadets performing ""Via Dolorosa."" Her English is as accent-free as her Spanish; no wonder she is a Walt Disney favorite. Goose bumps and tears -- are my reactions when listening to this song!!!"
3,A Passable Story,"I had been reading fantasy novels for about 10 years or so before I read this book. I found the book quiet tedious to read on some occasions and quite easy and exciting during others. The book never really drew me in. I did feel some affinity with the main characters but they could also be quite frustrating at the same time. I would advise this book be approached as just an average book with some above average moments. All in all, not a bad read but it could have been so much better."
3,"Great optics, but that's all","I had this camera for over a week. I took pictures daily and rounded up about 300 pictures all around Norwalk, CT. Did inside shots of nuseums, malls. Did outside shots of gardens, parks, fall colours in sunshine and fog. All great shots. Macro parallelx problems on closeups in Macro mode was awful. The center of the view finder cross-hairs puts the center at the top of the LCD screenTook it to the harbour to grab some shots of speed boats, cars. WRONG! The shots between writes was for-ever (it seems). Missed some shots of kids water skiing (COLD kids). My DSC-F55 grabed some shots thatyou cannot tell between the DSC-S70 and the F55.I'll wait until they improve on the performance by adding a bigger buffer."
5,"Even after 7 years, this camera is an A+","Even after I have purchaced my new A100 10 mega pixle SLR camera I still find myself takeing this 7 year old DSC-S70 with me on day trips, the picture quality is amazing even for todays standards. It wont accept my new 1 and 2GB memory sticks, but that is expected. Awesome job Sony!"
3,questions,"I am looking to buy a compatible video and still camera and think that the sony pc-5 and the DSC-70 would be compatible. The pc-5 is stripped down to the basics for a consumer camera and is small enough to carry in a pocket without looking bulky. If I'm buying a good digital still camera, I don't need the pc-100 which is the same video camera with a slightly better still function. My question is, can I take the memory stick out of my 3.+ megapixal still camera and put it in my pc-5 digital camera, download the pictures onto the digital tape and maintain their high 3.+ resolution, thereby circumventing the need for multiple memory sticks on an extended trip, for example? I have not seen this question addressed anywhere and would like to find out."
1,Super Fragile,I used the camera twice and found the viewfinder cracked. Sony refused through various channels to resolve the issue. They wanted more than I paid for the camera to repair it. Good luck if you have any troubles.
1,Sony Cyber shot SDC-70 Digital Camera,"The Camera works great, but the accessories need improvement. I never could get the USB cable to work. After trashing my hard drive I tried to load the driver on another PC and still had the same problem. (Both systems win 98) The 8MG mem stick is a joke. The reason I bought the camera was for higher resolutions and improved picture quality over the floppy disk cameras. Had to fork out 200 clams to fix my problems. If you just want pictures to send for email to friends, buy a cheaper product. The fix solution for the USB cable, consult PC manufacturer. Bogus... Be prepared to pay more in accessories that you will need for your complete package. Sony needs to give me the option to upgrade the mem stick and pick an option of download transfer. (I had to pay 70 clams for a 3X5 card adapter.) Total price paid 1000 clams. You can probably find a better camera that has all these accessories available."
5,"Looks like a very good camera indeed, but it's a 6X...","This is not exactly a review, as I am thinking seriously about getting this camera...However, someone made an error and/or typo regarding the zoom specs, including those that reviewed it. I cannot believe some folks don't know their own camera! Sorry, but this model digital camera has a 6X digital zoom, NOT a 2X! It plainly says it on the right side of the camera in big bold black letters, and also in the technical specs.Just an observation, and not my own humble opinion...Seriously though the DSC-S70 looks like a very good camera, and I am not a camera guru, but for the average user, it should be more than adequate, and then some. Thanks as all of the reviews were quite helpful. I just may get this camera indeed...."
5,My wife's eye problem,It helps my wife'e eye problems (Fuch's Syndrome). It is much cheaper than buying it at the local drug store.
1,constant clogging of tip when bottle is half full,I have been using this product for many years and it works well except for fact that tip clogs I need to use needle to unclog. This usually happens when bottle is half used and can be difficult to use remainder of solution. Last time I unclogged tip the cap flipped off and I lost the solution .
5,Excellant temporary relief,"My doctor recommended this after I started having a soreness in one of my eyes after surgery. He advised me it was good for a temporary relief. I used the product four times days and the result has been excellent. Expect a slight burning sensation when the drop hits your eye. that sensation will quickly disappear. As for price, I paid was too much at the drug store. Could have gotten a bottle twice as large for less money had I gone to Amazon."
3,Item could be fine...seller is a disaster,"These drops were recommended by my ophthalmologist, so I assume they're fine. My problem? The seller, Dh Medical, which can't seem to ship me the right product. The first time, they sent me totally wrong drops; the second time, they sent me ointment! Phone response is laggard, in spite of a stated 24 hour turnaround time. The company also takes weeks to respond to email. Avoid this vendor!"
1,The CHEAPEST place to buy Muro 128 5% solution,"Amazon is the CHEAPEST place to buy Muro 128 5% solution. NOT from the two Canadian sources quoted above NOR from drugstore.com. You can check them out yourself, which I have done recently. Check the shipping costs; buy two or more from Amazon and the shipping is FREE! Not so with the other sources."
4,Hardy Boys 03: The secret of the Old Mill - review,Very good. It had a excellent mystery and I loved the part when they discovered the counterfeit money. I thought that was a very good idea!
3,Good Book,"This was a story about the Hardy Boys trying to solve a mystery about catching countefieters. It has interesting people in it like Ken Blake, a kid who in the story who becomes a friend to the brothers. There is excitement and mystery when they find a secret tunnel in a cave. This tunnel ends up being part of another hidden room that the boys find leading them to more clues. I enjoyed trying to figure out the mystery by the clues that are found in the story. Their stories are kind of predictable sometimes, but I still enjoy them. The story is exciting and makes you want to keep on reading."
4,"nice looking, but uncomfortable for long periods","I bought this bench to go on a small balcony. I found the assembly easy. However, I find sitting on it for more than 20 minutes uncomfortable. There is little or no back support. If you are considering this bench, I would suggest finding some cusions both for sitting on and for the back."
3,Well built but beware the filler,"Normally I'm a little nervous ordering something that requires assembly, but the bench arrived with all the pieces needed. Though the assembly directions were minimal anyone with some experience can put the bench together in a matter of minutes. The bench is sturdy and reasonably comfortable to sit on. My only disappointment is that the wood has many filled holes about the size of a pin head. I assume that this isn't a problem if you let the wood weather. I chose to use tung oil as a finish. The wood takes on a beautiful brown color, but the filler doesn't absorb the oil and the filled spots are very noticable."
5,English Garden Bench,"This is a beautifully made bench and was a breeze to assemble. It looks great, but wasn't built for comfort--seat should've been a bit wider front to back. It looks very sturdy. I feel good just looking at it in the yard--that's worth something."
1,What a disappointment !!!!!,"This bench was a disaster !!! None of the dowel holes lined up. The front rail was warped so badly that we could do NOTHING with it !!! I do not recommend it at any price. If I could get the thing apart without using an axe, I'd return it immediately. I intend to write the company for replacement and pick up of the mess we received. We ordered this bench along with another one made by Gardenside Designs at the same time. Thank goodness we assembled the Gardenside bench first....otherwise we would have been too frustrated to attempt a second one. The Gardenside bench went together without a hitch and was beautifully made. I highly recommend their product over Oxford's."
2,Aluminum not a good buy,"The burner provided with this unit will burn a hole in the bottom of the aluminum pot very quickly if there is not any water or oil in it. We're talking a matter of about 2-3 minutes here. I have a pot with a hole in it to prove it. I have subsequently ordered the Stainless steel pot. The aluminum pots are very soft and it is also possible to scrape them with stainless steel utensils. I am used to commercial cookware mainly. The only aluminum pots I have have a 1/4 inch of aluminum on the bottom. As this thing was a gift, I will take it to a welding shop and have a large aluminum plate welded to the bottom after the hole is cleaned-up, the wife will never know. It is my fault for not putting in the oil before placing it on the burner, but I was just boiling away the water from cleaning it out, which is standard kitchen procedure. Plenty of heat, which is what you need, but buy the stainless rig."
4,The Climbing Boy - A Revelation,"A poignant read depicting the harsh realities of life for a small boy employed by a chimney sweep in the 1800s. The story does not glorify or embellish the child's plight, rather it show-cases the trials and tribulations of the era in a way that is both knowledgeable and sympathetic, yet does not hide from the extremes.This book kept me captivated from start to finish."
5,Great book,"You can really feel like your part of the story. The people in the book are so real.Also, it wasn't hard to use. I just clicked on a little icon after inserting the cd into my computer. I think this is a good e-book for people who are new to their computers.The author Mark lictermin (spelling?) is on my list of good authors. Not too many make that list."
5,Anointed book,"This book is one that you won't read just once. I first read Temple Builders a few years ago and have sent it to other friends. God used its insights to confirm so many things that He was speaking to me. If you really want to get an eternal perspective, this book is life changing. Every believer should read this one."
5,Not for the Faint-hearted!,"Had I read this book even two years ago, I am certain I would not have comprehended the Temple Builder message. The author John Robert Lucas presents his ideas in a dense and intricately woven text--most assuredly strong but necessary meat for any Christian. To avoid indigestion, however, I suggest reading no more than one chapter at a sitting! I believe the message contains a spiritual imperative for the contemporary church. The path toward true maturity in Christ is not easy, not cheap, and not for the faint-hearted. I highly recommend this book to those (especially) who find themselves in the ""dark night of the soul"", and are searching for understanding and hope for tomorrow."
3,Boss RC-20XL,"The only problem on this pedal is to setup the speed bit, it is really hard to setup the time bit (speed). If fact it is not easy at all."
1,Horrendous waste of money.,This thing is absolutely god awful. It's only use is a recording device to remember melodies. It is impossible to time this piece of trash correctly it has a terrible delay when you hit the pedal. Waste of money. So if you are wanting to play live don't get this garbage pedal as the timing is so off there's no point.
5,A great Solder Reflow Oven,"I don't know how well it cooks food, but let me tell you with a controller it out performs a 2000.00 reflow oven.You can easily control the temperature +/-5C with a K type thermocouple and an external controller that can be had for less that 100.00.If you need to make SMD pc boards and are sick of long hours on a microscope this product is for you. Check for auctions on ebay to get the controller, but the Amazon price for the oven is the best I have seen."
3,"Hard to clean inside, needs better directions (cook book)",The black and Decker infrawave oven is not all that I had hoped for. It is not easy to clean and it does not cook food evenly. I think it is as good as a toaster oven but not spectacular as I had hoped : (I agree that it needs a cookbook deperately.
4,Great little oven,I have had this oven for awhile now and I really like it. Brownies and cakes are easy and rise a little higher. Pizza reheated in this oven is crisp and like when first baked-fabulous. If nothing else it is great for reheating pizza but I find it good for baking and other things as well.Great product-I am getting one for my daughter and her husband.
1,Countertop Oven,"I got this oven around Nov 20, 2007. It worked ok at first, but it does take longer to cook most items than advertised. Now it only works in the ""toast"" category. All other categories start but then all the lights go out, the display goes out and the oven turns off immediately upon touching the ""start"" key. Pretty expensive ""TOASTER!"" Also, the racks are very cheaply made."
2,I've had mine for 4 months!!,"I ordered mine from tv. As soon as I got it i started cooking everything in it. It does cooks just about anything faster. I bought it to save some time. It really does make french fries crispy, left over pizza new again, muffins take a little longer though, i cooked christmas dinner in it & just about anything else. I thought it was gonna replace most my cooking appliances, but AS I SAID BEFORE I'VE HAD IT FOR 4 MONTHS & IT DIED THIS MORNING!! IT'S A LOT TO PAY FOR A COUPLE MONTHS OF USE, I THOUGHT IT WOULD ATLEAST WORK FOR A YEAR, BUT NOW I'M BACK TO USING MY OVEN, TOASTER, & MICROWAVE!! BUT IT WAS THE PERFECT KITCHEN ADDITION, OTHERWISE!!"
3,bacelor cooking,"I have not cooked a meal in this appliance as yet but have tried the toast and reheat features.The toast done was superb without any burning, however the reheat feature was useless as the food which came out of the refrigerator, took forever to get hot I finally used the toast feature and increased the time to get the food to a reasonable temperature.I will review again after I have attempted a full meal over the weekend"
2,head of household,"Oven capacity is too small, oven racks and pans are cheaply made. I don't think B&D intended to make a quality product, just one for tv promo's."
2,Be careful - examine before buying,"We like Black and Decker products and bought this one using our past experience. A mistake. While the unit does cook things quickly as advertised, it does not show temperature making it difficult to judge when something is done. Choosing the correct cooking setting is a real pain. Toast is done on one side and not done on the other. The toast settings are inconsistent. One day I used 2 as a setting and the next day I had to use 5 to get the same color of toast.My guess is that we will continue to use this oven for a short while until we are so frustrated that we buy something else."
3,Good but over-priced,"I have had this InfraWave oven for a couple of weeks and it pretty much performs as advertised ... couple of comments(1) would be a great value at half the price.(2) external top gets very, very hot"
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Items take longer to cook than advertised. Also, toast unevenly. If you put a roll in to toast it catches on fire!I miss my old Delonghi."
1,This is a joke,"When I purchased my first oven I was pleased. It did cook some minor things well. After about of 2 months it died. I did get a replacement, but replacement unit would not turn on. It was a brand new unit that was dead on arrival. Very disappointed. I paid $150 on piece of scrap metal. Thanks!"
2,Disappointing,"We do not like to use a microwave, so we hoped this oven would cook faster than a regular toaster oven. We could never get the timing right for anything we wanted to bake or broil. The menu is supposed to make it easy to program what you want to accomplish with specific types of food (""reheat pizza"" for instance). But what we had to cook never matched the pre-programs on the menu, so we fiddled and fiddled to adjust the settings. This is not easy to do, with no back light in the setting window and unnecessarily complex procedures. We ended up using it mostly for toast, but the toast would always get darker on one side than the other, & it took up a lot of space as a 4-slice toaster! After 15 months the upper elements quit working, which was both a disappointment and a relief... Now we can look for a simple toaster oven to replace it."
3,slow cooking times,Had to add more time to cook items in most cases. Food cook well. The display does not have a back light making it difficult to see without a lot of light.
5,Nice chimes!,This is the second set of bamboo chimes I have purchased and they are great. Love them.
5,Forbidden Relatives,"Very enlightening sociology. I have a particular interest in this subject because my late husband came from a culture that arranged marriages between first cousins as a matter of course and tradition. When I did his genealogy on Family Tree Maker software, it reports that he is his own second cousin. This book is a ""must have"" for every amateur genealogist's library."
1,How did a major publishing company approve this?,"I bought this book at a used book sale at the library for $1.00, and I didn't get my money's worth. I hate to be mean, but this may be the worst book I've ever tried to read. On page 24, the word ""necklaces"" is spelled ""necklesses"". Twice.Some of the narrative is absolutely preposterous. The citizens of Butte standing around placing bets on how long a teenage Bobby Knievel could elude police on his motorcycle? Please. This book reads as if it was written by someone who watched a bunch of television shows about Evel Knievel, then just made up a bunch of stuff to fill in the gaps. I finally gave up about 40 pages into it. I'm thinking about taking it back to the library book sale next year, and just leaving it on a table somewhere.I'm sure that author Ace Collins meant well. His writing style indicates that he probably spends a lot of time watching Glenn Beck. I feel kinda sorry for the guy."
2,"Should have named himself ""Conceded Knievel""","I can't say the writing is bad, just the subject. An American Hero ? A womenizing, boozing, petty thief and con-man a hero, I don't think so, probably a fun guy to hang out with.. but no hero."
2,Kaplan Emergency prep SAT,This SAT guide was difficult to use and had mainly games that were good but not much for prep. Maybe I just didn't figure out how to use it. I wouldn't buy or recommend this product.
1,The Digital Remix is awful!,"To my great sadness, and after years of pursing this CD, when it came in the mail, it was so full of loud pops and static that it is unlistenable! I understand that these are old recordings--I did have a cassette tape of this same release which is what drove me to find CD. I'd been looking for either a CD or another cassette since about 2002. I was so excited to finally find one, and then so sad to actually hear it.I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a digital remaster."
4,Filters,"Cooking Oil Filter Pump (Works Great)Item #38084How can I buy replacement filters?What is cost for 5 (3-pack replacement filters, Item #38085)?What is cost for Shipping?Thanks, Art"
5,KEEPIN KALI REAL!!,"If your a fan of Underground Northern Kali Gangsta Rap,you need this CD. All of woodie's compilations are tight,but this one tops um all!! Support all Underground rap by gettin dis Album,Killa Kali stay real!!!"
2,Adrian Brody?Gimme a Break!,"This is a tough guy movie so why put in Adrian Brody?What a disapointment. Like putting Jack Black in King Kong. Who told that guy he can act? Stick with the original 2 predator movies for tough guy action, and the first AVP."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of the first 2 films, but this one was missing so much it was ridiculous. Let's try and keep this short, but it's the truth - dialogue was pathetic, serious lack of gore and creative deaths was just sad, story was too plain, and the predators themselves have completely LOST all of the personality of the previous films. Plus one of the lamest attempts at a ""twist"" ending I've ever seen, totally fell flat on its face.If you're a fan of the originals, this was like some PG-13 watered down mess."
1,The folks behind this film should be ashamed!!!,"Unbelievably disappointed! Not once, but several scenes show a 'predator' removing its cloak and simply standing there and growling all mean like instead of immediately slaughtering whoever it may be. There's a scene where Laurence Fishbourne's character is talking about how they've gotten 'smarter, and changed up their hunting tactics'. These tactics include standing around, un-cloaked, and growling. They've tried to turn it into a horror film. The main actors fake voice reminds me of batman in 'the dark knight'...He 'growl-talks' and it makes me want to kick a hole in my TV.The people who are leaving 'good' reviews are simply trying to justify their unfortunate purchase of this monster pile of crap. Yeah, the monsters 'look' good and all predator like...but the simpletons who wrote the story are weak souls and very likely on sedative drugs."
1,Movie sucks,"This movie had such a good set up.. and then fell flat on it's face. It just wasn't good. I'm a hardcore fan I've seen all the movies and read many novels based on the alien and predator franchises and I've never heard of this other race of predators. To me, that ruined the movie (among other things). They took the original predator, the icon of badassery from my childhood, and had him b*** slapped around like a ragdoll. They took the most bad ass thing in the universe, and made it into a big p***y. Why would they throw a screwball at us with this random new race of predator? I just don't get it. No need for that, stick with the original. It wasn't broke don't try to fix it.Yet another fond child hood memory.. raped. Indiana, predator, star wars.. all ruined. I wish I could be more specific but I don't really remember much of the movie other than I started hating it 20 minutes in and wanted to walk out of the theater. This movie sucked and everyone giving it above 3 stars has no taste."
3,Very Good action but falls a little short,This is best predator movie since the the original. I love the premise for this one. But the movie does not add anything to the mysique that the other movies did. This is basically an action film that stands on it's own. Nothing original happens. Basciacally a retread of all the spills and thrills of the original. That's not to say it's a bad film. I enjoyed it. It was cool to see ex-UFC champ in the movie and there were some unexpected twists. If you like action give this a try and is fun. But Don't expect anything original.
4,AHH BATTLE!,"I am a fan of the franchise so it stands to reason I should have this. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as it left a lot to the imagination but I have to believe, at some point, some of the questions I have after watching this will be answered in subsequent movies. It let's you know that the Predator franchise is not going anywhere and there is more to come. I can hardly wait."
4,Interesting twist on original theme.,"I enjoyed this movie a lot but I am a Predator fan. It is an interesting spin/twist on the original theme that possibly helps give more insight into these bizarre creatures. I like the special effects and the cast of characters is very interesting. Yes, this is SciFy, but I like it."
3,Rip Off of a Movie,"Watching this movie was like watching a handful of really great sci-fi movies. A lot of this movie was taken directly from Aliens; some of the dialogue, the music in the beginning was similar, the ship where Noland lived looked just like the Nostromo or Sulaco. Give me a break, if I wanted to watch Aliens again, for probably the 75th time, I would. When the predator ship was about to take off from the forest the camera shots and lighting reminded me of E.T.. Come on! I can't say the movie wasn't entertaining because it was. Fishburne gave an outstanding performance, and he always does, he is a great actor. That crappy drawing of the surrounding planets, repeating the ""F word"" every other sentence, the casting was off, and what really gets me is how the doctor knew the name and particulars of a plant on an alien planet, doesn't make any sense, the plot is full of holes. Remaking the original had such potential. What were the makers of this movie thinking? Maybe they weren't."
1,Unsolisted junk,"Ordered a DVD and also got stuck with video crap on demand, with no option to rid my computer of unsolisted crap."
2,horrible,"This movie was a let down for me. I love predator and predator 2, but this should have never been made. Horrible story with characters you don't care if they live or die. The biggest problem in this movie is that they ruined the actual predators. They aren't cool in this film. I know that sounds silly, but seriously, this movie makes them out to be wanna be tribal hunters or something. They're supposed to be technologically advanced hunters. The movie was just random and had no direction. There are a few twists, which were completely unnecessary. I'm not a judgmental or uptight movie watcher, but I have to admit, this movie was horrible."
2,movie didnt work,I received the movie and went to play it in our blue ray player and it wouldnt work. Couldnt get it past the menu. Our other disks worked in the player.
2,Save yourself the trouble and watch the original instead,"File this one under ""useless"" sequel. Director Nimrod Antal and producer Robert Rodriguez essentially recycle every halfway decent idea from the original film with less than satisfactory results. The film tells the story of several mercenaries and killers dropped onto a an alien planet game preserve as they are hunted down by the title creatures. Plenty of people die, the visual effects are lacking, and the whole thing seems like a waste of time. Kudos must be given to Adrien Brody, however, for effectively conveying an action hero without the usually requisite tough guy build. Still, he's no Arnie or Carl Weathers. Through the film's runtime, I continuously found myself wishing I could just watch the original. 2 out of 5 stars."
5,Very good! Must see!,"Just finished watching this movie. Very impressed! I personally watched it because of Adrien Brody and he didn't let me down, as usual. ;) The movie itself is very entertaining, fast developing, exciting, I definitely had fun watching it!Rent it of buy it, you won't regret it!Awesome movie, awesome played Mr. Brody! Bravo!"
1,Pathetic,"Another great opportunity at ""finally"" making a decent sequel to the original Predator gone to waste... Talentless, boring and borderline stupid, Nimrod Antal and Robert Rodriguez deliver a disappointing movie. There's not a shred of originality in this frantic sci-fi sequel.Oh and that shot in the trailer of multiple laser sights trained on Brody is a cheat! Starts out with a bang but ends up with a thud..."
2,Where did the plot go?,"Total disappointment. No plot, no redeeming characters, no ending. A bunch of not so nice characters mysteriously land on a planet and are hunted by some ugly creatures seemingly for the fun of it. Ends with 2 left and looks like no way out. Stayed to the end but really wasn't one. Skip it - not worth even sending back and forth to Netflix."
2,I didn't like it,"I didn't like Predators at all, I honestly think it's kinda dumb. The plot was interesting I suppose, bringing the characters to the Predators' planet rather than going to earth. But the characters themselves weren't all that great, I didn't care about any of them. Some of them just felt wasted, too, like they were there just to fill up empty space. The action was decent, but not great, and I didn't really feel any thrill or suspense. Meh, just not a very good movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,samurai,"the only thing that I enjoyed in the movie was the scene when the japanese guy fight a predator with a katana. since I pratice also with it, for me it was fun to watch :) ........and the katana killed the predator! so much about how do you need a high-tech weapons to fight (a billions of dollars to spend for so-called national security nonsense)."
1,Horrible...AVOID.,Everything about this movie was awful. Brody as an action guy purposely deepening his voice to sound more macho. Were the Predators even in this movie? They were so lame I can't even remember. This makes Requiem seem like a Masterpiece.AVOID
1,why was vit made,"Piss poor movie making.. Ate my popcorn cuz I was hungry...terrible story, worse acting, no suspense, worthless plot. I am ashamed I paid $ TO SEE IT IN THEATER. What a sad, disapointing waste."
3,...good attempt but not good enuff...,"...Pros: new predator designs are kool. movie takes place in the jungle where it belongs not in the city like in P2. I like the variety of different ""victims"". Adrien Brody was very good in this movie even though i dont think that he is leading man material, they should of gotten someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson or Gerard Butler....Cons: Adrien Brody is jus not a tuff enuff lookin actor for this movie. an old overweight Laurence Fishburne survives 10yrs in the predator game world and even learns how to use the predators equipment but then is quickly killed off in 15mins? LOL! in Predator 1 & 2 one predator killed loads of people yet the 3 more advanced predators in this movie gets killed pretty easily."
3,"Good action for the series, but copied too much from part one","For all the fans of the Predator series this one may disappoint. I liked the action, but this movie literally copies part one with Schwarzenegger. First off the story is entirely in the forest as a rag tag group of various people (criminals, soldiers, and doctors) try to figure out what they're doing in some random forest together, and knowing most of the lines from part one, Adrian Brody copies lines and for some reason he copies a lot of what Schwarzengger does at the end of part one (you need to see part one if you haven't). This is probably a script/director mess up so I don't fault Brody.Another poor part of Predators is that it doesn't take the series anywhere. So from a pure sci-fi action film, its good, but you won't get anything out of it as far as watching all three movies from the Predator series because it doesn't give us anything ""new"" (Not counting Aliens v. Predator series)."
4,Not bad for a Predator sequal,"Enjoyable, and twisty. As with all predator movies, the audience is placed in the shoes of the hunted, but this time it's not a team, or at least the group doesn't start as a team. Each character is allowed to get a little of their history out in the open for the audience. Some are still curiosities. A few unsuspected twists add some new story drivers to the ""Predator"" series, making this third film a bit of a stand-alone in the trilogy. This is not a sequal to AVP or AVP2, but a sequal to ""Predator"", and ""Predator2"", and worth adding to your collection. 4 stars because it was short, or at least I expected more maybe..."
2,Digital copy,"The shipper did not say it was just the digital copy. So when i actually went to play it, I couled play it on anything other than my laptop. The movie is cool, but since I can't watch it too often because i use my laptop for other things, I don't get to watch."
3,Excellent bluray...an alright flick!,"I didn't go in with high expectations considering some of the reviews I've read here. To be honest, I thought the movie was alright. It's not exactly non-stop action from beginning to end and it can drag a bit in certain places. Nevertheless, I didn't get bored.The bluray is first rate in all regards. It was very impressive in terms of picture and sound. 10/10 for the disc and 6/10 for the flick itself."
4,Predators,Not a Vacation spot you would want to end-up at!Fast action and with good actors.4 stars because they should had more actors left at the end than only 2.
4,"Great Entertainment for a Lazy, Summer Afternoon","I went to see this movie during a Saturday afternoon matinee, where I had a few hours to kill. I enjoyed this movie so much and there was so much going on with the story, that I went back on Sunday evening, the next day, to watch it again and was just as entertained looking for the nuances and details in the movie. Similar to Avatar, which I also watched twice during a 2 week period, I caught a lot more information the second time around. I fully intend to purchase the movie as soon as it is available on DVD. I hope there is a director's cut with additional footage. I went in with low expectations, but was throughly pleased and surprised. I also enjoyed the new twist in the story between the two Predator species...I am sure this will lead to more interesting sequels:)"
2,Be careful of the Blu-Ray....,"I'm going to leave the review of the movie itself to others. I'll merely point out that this particular BD does not play well with many BD players. Of the three BD players I have, it won't play in two of them, even after firmware upgrades. It's not just the disc I bought, as I returned it and the second one does exactly the same thing...nothing. The player reads the BD a little bit (just enough to give you the first warning message) and then stops dead in the water. One of my friends had exactly the same epxerience (both of us have an older Sony BDP-S350), but it also wouldn't work in a newer LG. Very frustrating and a waste of money."
2,Not Good At All,"I remember being so excited to see this movie and as I watched it, I kept waiting for something to happen, something interesting, something intriguing, something that made me gasp or scream or was interesting but it never delivered. This is one of those movies where you could care less about the characters, and you just sit through it waiting for it to be over. Very disappointing movie and nothing like the original. In fact it's a shame that this movie has a similar title and is associated with the original Predator movie."
5,Tops!!,"I loved this movie. Action all the way! The ending was a little disappointing, but left an opening for a follow on episode."
3,Better than expected,I kind of had my reservations about this movie but it was better than I expected it to be. It's an okay movie if you were into the first one.
3,Won't play in blu ray player,"Good movie, I watched it on DVD from netflix, but I also bought it on this blu ray format and it will not play in my Samsung blu ray player, irritating. I have not had any problems playing perhaps a hundred blu ray titles including new releases, until this title."
3,JUNGLE BOOGIE,"You gotta admire Adrien Brody...the Oscar winning gent has gone from KING KONG to SPLICE to this sci-fi actioner and he has acquitted himself well. This film is more like the original than a mere sequel and it has some great action sequences and the cast is overall very good. Laurence Fishburne's cameo seems a little superfluous and overdone but helps in an expository fashion. It took a little too long IMO to get to the predators but once there, the film maintains good pacing.Overall, Brody made a good action hero and Topher Grace's surprise ""twist"" nicely done. Let's hope the inevitable sequels are as well done."
4,Good Movie,"I am an absolute fan of anything Predator, this movie was no exception. For those of you who haven't seen it I definitely suggest watching it. This isn't the best Predator movie out there but it's pretty good."
1,awful,adrien brody has slumped to an all time low. topher grace is terrible again. the only reason I give it one star is because predator movies are classics. why they are making these new ones idk. dont waste your time.
5,Back to being a great movie,"If you likes the first two as I did , you will like this one. You could never replace Arnold , but this is back to the original formula . My favorite science fiction movie of 2010. It is much better than the last one. Just don't expect the 1st one...you could never match it.....you already know the premise now....so don't expect surprises as you had in the 1st one. If you watch the details of this one , there is a lot of subtle info that you are probably missing. I went to the Predators website and it gave a lot more background info that you may not realize unless you are extremely attentive in the movie. Like there are 2 different types of predator in this movie and they have different weapons. One is more advanced in a lot of ways and bigger. A lot of people missed this , but it is obvious if you pay attention."
3,Not as good as the original,"Not really sure how some of the other reviewers can favor this one over the original. Unless they are basing it solely on Laurence Fishburne's small role in the movie, which he portrayed perfectly. Overall, I would choose the original over this one any day."
5,awesome!,"Predators is a really awesome thriller, along with good actors. I've always liked the Predators series especially the first 1 with Arnold Schwarzenegger."
3,Well Received Gift,"My boyfriend is a collector of all things Alien & Predator; books, comics, sculptures, films, you name it, so I got him this missing piece of his collection for Christmas. Unfortunately all the special features and collector's editions are now only on bluray. In spite of this being nothing but the bare bones I am assuming it is good quality in both sound and picture, as he would have told me otherwise, lol. The case did seem a little flimsy."
3,"Nice new try, luke warm results","Intereseting new ideas and backdrop with this new episode in the series. It is not really a reboot or sequel so much as an exploration of a new story, even though it does have roots referrenced back to the original movie. The cast is capable but not matched up to their roles well and the director does not use them wisely. He is the reall problem, in that he does not have a clear vision of what this movie should be and the direction it should go in. It is slow in the wrong places and too skimpy in others where it needs more depth. Overall this is not as good as the first movie. As a home rental it was okay and had its moments. But at the theater, it was a disappointment. This new trip to the hunting grounds of this sci-fy series was under developed and left a watered down taste in your mouth. I was always looking back to the origin thinking this was better, that was more fun, etc. when I should have been caught up in this new movie's flow and excitement."
3,could of been so much better.,"requiem got slaughterd by the masses but they realy had a chance to make this a classic,how on earth they got it wrong so claustrophobic silly stupid one liners,oki dont mind hero being a skinny pimp but the rest of the clowns inc,they had a great opener and i believe yeah this is it with all the tech cgi effects this has to be 2010 letdown in my view reqium would easily piss on this this crappy movie,nolands character never really kicks off i mean the hunters being hunted,the preds are just as bad the russian japanese the rapist the black muslim,then in the end he beats the pred with a log/predsword,i could of written a better script such a letdown my god such a awful film the crew the whole crew writers directors should be sent to guantanomo for 10years,dony buy it if you do email me il pay u but before smash it up the dvd/bluray and send in post to the makers."
2,Shockingly Bad,I really liked the original Predator and thought after seeing the preview that this version would at least be interesting.Its not very and the acting was poor. Brody looked great but his tough guy drawl just didn't work. This homage to the original just failed on too many levels to be entertaining. A rental.
1,VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First I would like to say the picture quality of this blu ray is amazing. The reason why I gave it one star is because when I poped the disc into my PS3 I had to sit and stare at a black screen for about 10 minutes. This is insane!!!! Why the hell is this disc taking so long to load? I have never had this problem with any other blu ray disc, EVER!!!! I googled and found others were having the same problem. I loaded all the extra content like one viewer said to do but I still have the same problem. I am thinking about returning this piece of crap."
2,Give it a rest,"Predator: Great. Alien: Good. Aliens: GreatAfter that it all went to crap. A whole mess of books and comics came out for both franchises, even a series of books combining the two. Aliens vs. Predator was AWESOME - in books. When it came to Alien3 and AVP the movie... it seemed like the writers of the movies had all this great source material that the fans loved, but decided to ignore all of it for the sake of originality.Good job.The sequels were all original, and horrible. Because all of the good stuff was already in the books, so by ignoring it all you had only one direction to go, make a bunch of crappy movies. Congratulations, hollywood, this franchise is officially dead."
1,My First Blu-ray,"Just received my first Blu-ray disk ""Predators 2010"". It's really a great experience watching the show ... It's so sharp & clear."
1,This movie made me want to skin myself,"Horrible movie. Worst casting ever in the history of ever. No matter how much Hollywood wants me to believe that Adrian Brody is a leading man / action star, I just cannot willfully suspend my disbelief. He is to action star as Arnold was to comedic actor. All around bad acting with weak plot and despite the couple of recognizable faces (L. Fishburne, D. Trejo), this movie is an affront to good entertainment."
3,"Pretty good movie, bad acting","This movie is pretty good so far. I just got to the part where they show the Predators. It's basically just all demons hunting the group of like 8 guys. I only saw bits and parts of the original predators, but Arnold did a good acting job in that movie. I heard good things about this movie so I thought I'd watch it. I was afraid it would be too gory, but honestly it's not bad at all compared to Ninja Assassin which I just saw. Ninja Assassin had an awesome storyline and superb actors, but the gore in that movie is pretty much unbearable. Anyways, if your afraid of the gore in this movie, don't be it really isn't as bad as you think. There are a few spots where it is, but nothing horrible."
3,a bit too short,not as strong as the first predator - and the sound is a not too dynamic for a blu ray
3,Decent action flick,"I like how the infinite ammo supply gets dropped when required by the plot. Oh well, it's not a novel. It's a movie. I enjoyed the characters. The action scenes weren't too bad either. I'll still take a book over a movie though."
2,Predator or Prey,"I'll try not to mention any spoilers. Let just say that this movie is to the other predator movies, as....Cousin Vinny is to serious drama. I would recomned seeing it as a Netflix, or some friend.It is slow, the plot is poorly generated. the characters are forced. All in all, if I hadn't scene it would have been better. This really needs to be flushed for what it is."
3,Weak,"So, I gave the movie three stars. It was better than the two AVP movies, but not by much.Rather than adding anything to the 'Predator' series, this movie was basically a remake of the original.Yes, there are some small differences, but overall, its the same movie, 20 years later.An appearance by Laurence Fishburne added Zero to the movie. Don't look for a 'Matrix'-worthy performance fromhim in this movie. It just isn't there."
3,It did it's job - to entertain,"This latest installment of my favorite film franchise is actually pretty good. Come on people, it's a predator movie, so let's not turn our IQs on overdrive and scrutinize every bit of movie.I have to admit that Adrien Brody as the lead tough guy was a little contrived, but this wasn't my major issue with the film. My major issue was that they killed off Danny Trejo so early in the film; that's borderline unforgivable. The character development is fairly well done, and the tension between the characters was a good ingredient for the plot.The deleted scenes include some good stuff, and they were entertaining to watch. I've watch the movie twice already, and I only got the Blu-ray 3 days ago."
2,One big step back...,"This film took one bug step backwards. The original one was the best and they began going downhill from there. This was no better. Yes, some cool FX, but story was pretty much idiotic and too far out there to even be believable."
3,"Facinating Underwater Photographs, Unremarkable Text","The creator of this book is a marine biologist, and the colorful overlays of his underwater photographs are so interesting, they make the text's general lack of flow (hence, the three star rating) seem less important. Both rare and more familiar fish are showcased, and notes in the back of the book identify them all. Some of the more fierce-looking fish presented are so intense they might be scary to sensitive younger readers, but they were not so for my two-year-old, who really liked puring over all the pages of this book."
3,product dimension,"I ordered this product as a replacement for the same book that my brother accidentally ripped. It turned out that this book was smaller compared to the original; it would have been better if the size was indicated. But overall, the contents was the same and the book was crisp."
3,mixed feelings,"This book manages to be a good read in spite of its flaws. At times the plot seems too transparent and contrived. There are numerous inaccuracies that interrupt the flow of reading. But, there is enough good writing and character development to offset this. It is not a masterpiece but can give you a few hours enjoyment if you're not too demanding."
1,Nancy Drew is for kids.,"I'm always looking for new authors, so I was excited when I read all the great reviews about this and other Heggan books. I was very disappointed. The reading level of this book is just a cut above Nancy Drew. The characters are predictable, and I had it solved before I was halfway through (and I don't even try to solve mysteries -- it was just that obvious). I really enjoy female mystery writers such as Sue Grafton, Patricia Cornwell, Sara Paretsky, and so on. This book is not at all in that league."
2,"Where's ""The Minstrel Boy?""","This is a fine CD, though it would be hard to top the actual sound track of ""Gettysburg,"" which is every bit as good as the posted reviews say it is. My one complaint is: where is ""The Minstrel Boy?"" Recall the scene in the film when Hancock and his staff come upon the Irish Brigade about to receive the blessing of their chaplain, Fr. William Corby. ""The Minstrel Boy"" is the march being played by the Brigade's fifers.It's one of the movie's many stirring scenes, and I can't for the life of me figure out why the producers of these two otherwise fine CD's could not find room for this ancient Irish march on either one."
5,INSPIRING! GREAT FOLLOW-UP SOUNDTRACK!,The second GETTYSBURG Soundtrack is almost as good as the first. It has a lot of great songs and tunes from the film. Jeff Daniels' recitation of the Gettysburg Address is stirring. My favorite tune is AMAZING GRACE. Buy this album! You'll never regret it! Grade: A+
4,"Good, but not without problems.","Just like one of the other reviewers, I must ask the question - where is ""The Minstrel Boy""? There was plenty of room on the CD for it and it was one song I was especially looking forward to. Also, the stero separation was a bit too severe when the song was played using only two instruments. I use headphones a lot and thus had one instrument in one ear and one in the other. Not the spacial set-up one would prefer. Other than the above gripes, it was a great CD and the tunes really stick with you."
2,The missing The Minstrel Boy mystery,"In seeking the song of Chapter 26 of the Movie Gettysburg, which is called The Minstrel Boy; it has been discovered it is missing from this particular CD. The artists who played this song are the Camp Chase Fife and Drum Corps. They have it on their CD #1. Apparently the studio dubbed The Minstrel Boy. The music credits are on the movie Gettysburg; that is how I found their web site and CDs for sale. I still would buy this CD as it is more professionally recorded and regret that they left off The Minstrel Boy--dubbed or not."
4,A very rare recording (in France),"An original and very hard-to-find recording of the civil war. It is what the first ""Gettysburg Original soundtrack"" should has been...I waited this item."
4,Very well done!,The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the original movie version of Kathleen Mavouneen had vocals and this soundtrack doesn't. Outside of that it is perfect for listening to on a Sunday morning as you read the newspaper. Soothing!
4,Well worth the headache,"This is a CD that demands to be listened to at high volume on a stereo that goes to 11. Not the very best of the Dolls, but still worth owning and listening to until your CD player self destructs from the noise."
5,Might as well be teak,"beautiful right out of the box, can be oiled but does not need it to look great...extremely easy to assemble, comfortable seat area, sturdy, looks just like teak at a fraction of the price."
3,The book was okay,"I am a teacher and thought this would be a good book to read to my 5th/6th graders. There were interesting pieces in the book, but overall, it was rather a boring read. I have taught over 30 years and love children's literature and this just didn't grab my attention or my students. I personally enjoy reading non-fiction and about animals and am surprised that this book didn't capture my attention as I had hoped."
5,new insight into wolves,Not only is this a great modern adventure story but it is a new way of looking at wolves and why they should be part of our landscape. An in depth look at family of wolves and their society.
5,Awesome!,This is by far one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard! Randy Edelman's powerful arrangements are so inspiring and motivating! This is definitely a must have CD even if you haven't seen the film.
5,Gettysburg is a great work of music for a great movie.,I think that the music for Gettysburg is powerful in the needed parts and beautiful in others. Randy Edelman did a wonderful job of composing and I couldn't hear any other music that could go with Gettysburg!-Matt
3,Not too bad,"This CD is made up of the music from the movie Gettysburg. Unlike the movie, you get to listen to the whole song and it is a good introduction to this type of music. It might be surprising to some that most of these songs were popular on both sides, many were rewritten (no lawyers out there then to scream copyright violations I guess) from eevn older songs, some going abck centuries. As music was so important to the men on both sides for moral and entertainment purposes, listening to them can enlighten you to what the common soldiers were thinking....However, if you like period (19th century) music and such, there are better CDs out there however. Check out Camp Chase Volume 1 (most of the musicians in the film ""Gettysburg"" were Camp Chase or 1st Maryland band members) The Irish Volunteers, or the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Tiger Band. The music rules and these guys are always setting up at the reenactments for free concerts!"
4,Almost 5 stars. A wonderful soundtrack.,"""Gettysburg"" was a wonderful movie, and anyone who enjoyed it will doubtless want to own and enjoy this soundtrack. The music of ""Gettysburg"" complimented the movie very, very well, and it is a pleasure to listen to in its own right. The battle music of ""Battle of Little Round Top"" is perhaps the most rousing battle music I've ever heard--unforgettable. The rest of the album is quite good as well. The ONLY reason I did not award the fifth star is that this album lacks a big blockbuster comparable, for example, to Mary Fahl's wonderful ""Going Home"" on the ""Gods and Generals"" soundtrack. That aside, this is a very very good soundtrack featuring excellent music which captures the Civil War theme beautifully and effectively."
5,music,Every time I listen to this I also want to watch the movie Gettysburg over again. I love the music and the movie.
5,Excellence,"Randy Edelman has created the perfect score. The music soars and plunges with the tidal waves of emotion that are set throughout the movie. While touring Gettysburg this summer, walking through the Devil's Den and up Little Round Top and standing on the field where Pickett's charge took place, I kept hearing Edleman's score in my head.Buy it... you won't be disappointed."
5,A wonderful Halloween-time Book,"I remember this book from when I was in kindergarten and always being scared, but loving it all the way through. It was filled with all the creepy images and stories that I could ever want, and when Daddy would read it to me in the fall it just put me in the immediate Halloween spirit. Witches, monsters, magic, ghosts, and everything else that any little kid would want in a scary book fill these 32 pages.This story deserves a 5 out of 5, for its nostalgia, ability to invoke a spooky feeling, and overall fantasy and storyline."
1,Little Insight,This book proved to offer on a little assistance in the understanding of the book of Ruth. The final comments (quotes) at the back of the book were actually the most helpful resource.
1,service not good,"I ordered a copy of this book, it said it had map in the back, no map, I wrote and they sent another book, the other one does not have a map either, so if I am paying for a map, I want a map or a reduction of the price of the book,also I cannot find out how to return the 1st or 2nd book.delilah evans"
5,Thanksgiving all year long!,"Easy to use, convenient and wonderful food! We started out with chickens and will graduate to the big bird turkey. Lemon Peper marinate injected (with a little hot sauce to spice it up) and we were in business. Also cooked french fries and breaded chicken strips. A car load of my son's friends showed up and we wound up having a party! NOTHING was left! Between the deep fryer and the grill, we won't ever have to use the stove again!"
2,Deceptive advertisement,The item received was not as advertised. Instead of a tall stand a short(lower than typical) was sent. Other items differ also.
4,Eastman Outdoor Kit,"I have seen this at work and was impressed. I cannot see how it can be a fire hazard, if used properly. I intend to buy one to use for when we are in the Nascar Infield, I am not too keen on deep fried foods but I think it would be excellent for steaming Lobster and clams."
5,Completely satisfied,The label tape was exactly what I needed and its price was half of the retail cost. It arrived in a timely fashion.
3,Resupplied my label printer,A little expensive to print labels but amazon was one of the few places that had these available. Work just fine.
4,Does the job,"Tape works as it should, don't have any complaints except that its a bit expensive. It could stick better maybe."
5,Works perfect!,"These work perfectly in my label maker. I go through quite a few because I use my label maker to make labels for my daughters bottles, etc. for her school. Makes life easier using these/label maker."
5,Label-maker tape,"I went to one of the big box office stores where I originally bought the label-maker - which works great, btw - and they didn't have replacement cartridges! Anyway, came to Amazon and there they were! They look, operate and produce as they should, so no worries."
5,Just as expected,Came on time and how I expected.nmeiu oapnevwap heviawonf vpoawnc ciewoapnc poiea vieo rwa mioapw rnmoien jdsi aon p rea
5,:LABELS,"As usual, this is a dependable product. I label my collection of DVDs with this tape. It is fun to use, easy to use and identifies my collection."
5,Runaway Ralph,...Runaway Ralph is about a mouse who runs away from home with his motorcycle and ends up in happy acres camp. Personally I think Beverly Cleary (the author) is trying to tell how bad it is to runaway from home. The book is so good I rate it a 5 out of 5.My favorite part is when Ralph is trying to escape from a cat and knocks almost everything in the craft center down. As you can see Runaway Ralph is a really good book.
3,My favorite mouse rides again,"Runaway Ralph is a pleasant journey provided by Cleary. There is both high action in the encounters with Catso and time for thinking in the introspection provided by Chum the gerbil. The only shortcoming is that I was looking for a little more solid of a change in Garf&#65533;s character; he starts off as a loner and I expected Ralph and him, through their bonding, would each learn to appreciate their peers more. Nonetheless an entertaining read."
3,GO Ralph go!,THIS BOOK HAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY & IT DOES END WELL BUT I THINK THE STORY SHOULD HAVE HAD VISUAL PICTURES SOMETHING TO ADD TO THE TALE OF RALPH & HIS MOTORCYCLE-ING! I REALLY DONT ENJOY BOOKS WITHOUT PICTURES TO HELP HOLD ON TO A YOUNG KIDS ATTENTION!I ALSO DONT LIKE BOOKS THAT JUST GO ON & ON WITH PRINT THATS JUST TOO SMALL FOR YOUNG READERS TO KEEP THEIR PLACE EASILY! IT MAKES YOUR EYES TIRED & MAKES YOU REACH FOR ANOTHER BOOK INSTEAD!ALL GOOD STORY BOOKS WOULD BECOME GREAT STORY BOOKS IF THEY HAD THE ARTISTRY TO GO THAT EXTRA MILE!
5,Runaway Ralph by Isaac,Runaway Ralph is about a mouse named Ralph and he lives in a hotel with is sisters brother and cousins. And one day Ralph got sick and tired of his siblings bossing him around so he thought he was going to run away. With his trusty steed his motorcycle. First he thought where he was going to go. Where was he going to stay? So he went out at night and he got on his motorcycle and was going to jump the stairs of the hotel. And so he got on his motorcycle rrrmmm. He was going speedy fast. Did he do it or did he fail to find out. Read the book!
5,Must see for everyone regardless of political beliefs,"How can you argue with the 9/11 volunteers whose medical issues have been ignored? How can we call them heroes, and then forget about them?If your house catches fire, do the firemen ask to see your homeowner's insurance before they'll put out the fire? Of course not, how absurd. The City road crew, policemen, teachers, coast guard, military, water and sewer department, etc., all provide a service, and are all paid through the government. Why not health care workers, including doctors, pharmacists, nurses, hospitals? Why is the level of health care you receive dependent on how much money, or how much insurance, you have? Why should companies get rich off of the sickness and injuries people suffer?Watch this movie, then take action to bring America up to the same standard that every other industrialized country enjoys. Our health care is substandard, and its a disgrace."
5,sicko,"Excellent documentary! Highly recommended for anyone wishing to be aware of the medical insurance crises in the United States and compared to other ""health care systems"" in other countries. Required for any debate or discussion on ""Health Care Reform""."
5,American Corporate greed,"I was working in the medical care field when highly paid administrators and insurance Co.s ""took over"" helth care in America.So many buy into the garbage put out by the special interests on this issue. America is a laughing stock to the industrialized world. Greed cannot be the only motivation for a country to exist."
4,Informative,"This film contains a lot of information. I used this in my high school anatomy and physiology course when I was going to be out for a few days. In an educational setting it is important to note to the students that even though this is a documentary, not all of the information regarding the health care crisis is represented. This film kept the attention of 17 & 18 year olds which is quite a statement for a documentary."
4,Kaiser,"""Sicko"" defines but a small portion of issues ingrained within Kaiser Permanente; the largest civilian HMO. This important film describes Kaiser's self-interested approach to healthcare in this country. Viewers are given a small window into that world, but allowed to see a facet of it deserving far greater expose'. Accolades to Mr. Moore's brave attempt to enlighten America to an issue long clouded with rhetoric and financial influence."
5,Michael Moore has done it again.,"As always, he gets in there where it's uncomfortable for those that believe that they are the elite and should be privileged. It is unconscionable that some have no health care. Good job Michael!"
3,SICKO,"THE COVER WAS ALOT MORE THAN A ""LIKE NEW"" STATUS. IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT SO IT HAS NOT BEEN VIEW AS OF YET."
1,Where is it??,"I placed an order for this movie on Aug 25. It is now Sept 5. Since when does it take 10 days to receive ANYTHING by mail!? Are they personally walking it to my house?!Seriously, I ordered another movie from another source and got it in 3 days!Not very happy with the shipping so far.Expected delivery date is supposed to be between Sept 1st & 17th?? Really, almost 3 weeks to get a movie shipped to me. Unbelievable. You can be sure that I will not be using the company again."
5,Don't get sick in the U.S. unless you've got a few million bucks laid by,"The U.S. is still a big, greedy kid that apparently won't grow up and become responsible, if it ever does, until it's undergone some real threats to its existence. The country is still playing at fulfilling the romantic frontiersmen image, and this is enabled because it hasn't yet used up all its natural resources, filled up its land with cities, and been invaded by marauding armies. European nations long ago went through all that and have realized that their survival depends on efficiency in using what resources they have. Michael Moore's film very clearly shows how this country's immaturity manifests itself in its outrageous ""healthcare"" system. If I were several years younger, I might well decamp to Canada and become a canuck."
5,The truth about American health care,"I don't buy movies often but after watching a copy of Sicko from my local library I just had to support the work that had been done on this documentary by purchasing my own copy. The dismal state of health care in America is not a pleasant subject and those who would have no compassion for others often denigrate Michael Moore's efforts at exposing the truth, but I am hoping that watching Sicko will open the hearts and minds of at least a few people out there who do not choose to keep their heads buried in the sand. Would that corporate influences in Congress could be eliminated so that all Americans could receive at least basic health services that EVERY other first world (and many 2nd & 3rd) nation on the planet provides to protect their citizens. There's no excuse for Americans suffering and dying from lack of care simply because they're American."
3,Interesting? Yes. Propaganda? Maybe...,"felt that this movie was very well done. The basic premise, of course, is that while we in the United States excel in many things, we are lacking in our development of a health care system that provides service to everyone. The film focuses on universal health care systems in countries like Canada, Great Britain, France, and even Cuba. It also shows many Americans who have had horrible experiences, even deaths, with the American Insurance and Health Care systems. I found the information in this film very enlightening."
4,SICKO,"I LOVED THIS MICHAEL MOORE documentary. I know a lot of people talk crap about him but believe me. A lot of what he said is really true. I have friends in Canada and in Cuba and it's really like that. Tyra Banks even commented not in this film but on her show, when she lived in Paris she use to pay 40.00 for a doctor to come see her in her apartment. Way different from the states. Universal health care not sure if it will ever be reality here in the states but I sure hope we the people can make that change. I am a self pay patient with no insurance and just to get a dermatologist consultation 200.00"
5,Best Movie of the Year,"This movie is one of my favorites. SiCKO is mostly about the American Health care system, however the greater theme is our GREED. I hate those who critizise Michael Moore for wanting us to have a better society. He does these movie for his love for America because he wants to make us a better country. Why cannot we learn from other countries and fix ourselves. We need to get out of our isolated world and look at what is happening around us. What works for them will most likely also work for us. Lets give it a chance. Lets live in a world without fear."
5,Go Michael!,"This is something that should be said during the Bush era (GW is in the film), but now we have Obamacare so we'll see. It's not as funny as Roger and Me but it says a lot about America and where we were compared to other countries that care for their sick. I would recommend it to people who think our healthcare is sufficient."
1,Does not play in Switzerland,"My wife is a doctor here in Switzerland and we always wanted to see Sicko. Unfortuntately when we tried to play the video we got the message that it does not work in our area. Another tiny problem is that Amazon sent us two Sicko videos instead of one. Needless to say, I will not be ordering any more videos over Amazon.Bob GriersonSwitzerland"
1,"If you like silly exaggerations, you will like this.","Filled with many well produced exaggerations designed to make a point and not necessary the truth of the situation. While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous. Anyone that's followed Michael Moore's work has learned to expect a certain amount of exaggeration in his films, but Sicko sets a new high bar for him. Net-Net: entertaining fiction presented as truth."
5,Excellent Revelation of Healthcare Debacle in the USA,"This film is an excellent exposure of the fraud being perpetrated by the insurance industry, HMO's, drug companies, the AMA and all of our bought and paid for politicians. A higher quality of healthcare at no cost exists in many modern industrial countries like Canada, France and the UK yet we in the USA continue to sell healthcare so that CEO's of HMO's become multi-millionaires while our political representatives are well paid to look the other way. Michael Moore tells the whole story with humor and compassion in this entertaining and informative film. I'm sure the healthcare criminals would like to supress this film."
5,An Important Public Service Announcement,"Michael Moore has done it again. This production --just like his previous works-- more than anything else, is a great service to the public, especially to the people of the United States. I hope every single person in the USA will make an effort to see this film and, all of them will take action to correct this outrageous disregard of the most essential right of every human being. It is hard to believe that the wealthiest, the most powerful nation on earth does not have a universal health-care system. By bringing this highly critical issue to the attention of the masses Mihael Moore has accomplished a great deal. I am very fortunate to live in Canada, one of the countries he visited to show how a decent health-care system does --and should-- work. Ted Kennedy tried very hard to make the same point several years ago; apparently his effeorts have not made any difference. I hope this film will create a positive change."
3,Bias,"I know some parts of this move were true but it soooo bias because of who directed it. Please don't let this be your only opinion on American healthcare. It's not perfect but this movie leaves out all of the benefit and successes in our healthcare system which is still one of the best in the world. If he hates it so much, he should move to another country, because let me tell you he is overweight and will need some healthcare in the future."
3,Sicko not a real documentary,"I like The work of Mickael Moore, but it's not documentaries where you expose different points of view...His piece is mainly about one point of view, that's a little awkwardI'm ok with the idea of universal social security but it's good in a documentary to hear from both sides, the ones who are for it and the ones who are against it (is there any??).And not all the french have a 8000 euros monthly income...so be careful about the foreign examples...they are not wrong but that's an easy example, it's like asking Paris Hilton if she can afford surgery!!!But beside that, i think the demonstration is quite good..."
5,Jesus -not crusaders- would love Michael!,"Mr. Moore sometimes gets attacked for being a fatso socialist who doesn't really make documentaries.In SICKO Moore leads a small film crew that shares the unravelled fate (of only a few of the 24,000) volunteered and desperate US health care victims who quickly replied to his call for attention.Moore, as an artful dodger, sheds light on some of the the most outrageously unfair cases upon an international stage. It is this staging that provokes the outrage of staid documentary consumers who feel easily threatened by health care systems which are less driven by stock market greed."
1,Im confused,"I dont usually take any type of advice from fat slobs. Luckily for Moore though, thanks to his pals movie 'Supersize Me', he now knows that stuffing his face isnt his fault, its McDonalds. Seriously though, if Moore thinks Cuba is so wonderful, and that America is so awful, it puzzles me why he still lives there."
1,Don't be fooled!!,"He makes a good point that health care would be wonderful IF it was free and readily available, but that is not a good idea for the US and the way it SHOULD be. It SHOULD be that the government stays out of the peoples lives here in the US. Government health care, i.e. Hilary-Care, is going to be MESS. It will cost much to setup, then after setup they will alter the way of it to save money, then it will be a very shody and risky system. Government control of most anything, in some ways even ""security"", is mostly always a bad thing for the citizens. This is a short and vague discription of why its bad but but beleive me this DVD has a sugar-coated, poisony message."
1,Split decision,"I actually prefer my fiction to be fiction and my documentaries to be non-fiction. I have never been a fan of taking the truth and stretching it to where it is no longer recognizable. And Michael Moore has taking stretching to a new art.If this was listed under fiction I would have given this 4 stars, it is colorful and imaginative but alas it isn't quite what it is advertised to be. Unfortunately the trend in Hollywood is to label the ""in"" thing as being factual and list it under documentary. If you are not familiar with the subject, you would be ill-advised to take Moore's word on anything and look for information in more respectable places."
5,A jaw-dropping experience,"We've always been brainwashed into believing that ""socialized medicine"" are dirty words and that if we had it here in the U.S., the quality of medical care would be far worse than it is now. (I don't know how much worse it could be than almost killing Dennis Quaid's twin babies.) Not so. Wait till you see this film! It'll make you want to move to France or Canada or England, or even Cuba, on the first plane out. The medical care that is offered in these countries is not only FREE, but also excellent, and apparently the doctors are not living on meager salaries like we've been told. One English doctor's salary has afforded him a comfortable lifestyle, with a million dollar home and a luxury automobile. And the cost of medication in Cuba will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. 5 pesos for the same medication that costs $150 in this country! If you haven't seen this film, do so quickly. It's excellent and a real eye-opener."
3,Good movie but quality was shit,The movie itself was great and I learned much about how screwed up our healthcare system is. Although the streaming was very crappy. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the quality of internet service or if their system sucks. Either way the quality was shit!
3,Interesting yet overblown,"I'm an independent who is somewhat put out by Michael Moore's phony poor-man pandering, and us-against-them mentality, yet there are definitely good and interesting features to ""Sicko."" It is informative and thought-provoking."
5,I'm Republican and give this 5 stars!,"Eye-opening. I'm not a Michael Moore fan in general, but this was a great documentary/movie or whatever you want to call it. I also watched ALL of the special features and highly recommend them. The private healthcare in this country is a huge failure overall... let's fix it so we're not the only western democracy without universal healthcare."
5,"Michael Moore's ""Sicko""","This film will open the eyes of all who view it regarding how the United States compares with other countries in caring for its sick. In a word - poorly. As Americans we must ask ourselves how we let our healthcare system get to this point and then be ashamed. We owe it to ourselves and our children to radically alter or replace the system with one that enables all citizens and visitors to receive affordable and quality healthcare. I purchased multiple copies of ""Sicko"" and gave them to friends as XMAS gifts as one baby step in doing my part..."
5,makes you think,"no matter what side of the fence you are leaning toward, this movie does make you think (and hopefully it's something more than 'Micheal Moore sucks! Micheal Moore sucks!). we really are in a health care crisis, and privatizing health care is handing our lives over to greed. But the problem is, I believe in our country, just not in the government. I think universal health care would work, I just wouldn't want to hand it over to our government to run. I've worked for the government- I know how it is.good movie."
5,This movie makes me SICK!!!,"Fabulous movie, but makes me mad as all get out! It is hard to believe that firefighters, paramedics, and police, that fought so hard for America on 9/11, have to fight to get medical care for the injuries they sustained they day! How awful that they have to go to Cuba to get treatment! America has some issues with health care and this movie brings out many of them!"
5,Sicko,"Excellent film! I am now retired after spending 22 years in the U. S. Air Force, Viet Nam era/error. I recently retired from a large American corporation. I was a volunteer at the World Trade Center disaster in September 2001. I simply toss out the surveys and other stuff I get from the World Trade Center Health tracking system as I know there is no sense in filling out the forms. Nothing will come of it.I shed tears of great sadness for my country, The United States of America.SEE THIS FILM!"
2,"Interesting, but Slanted...","Since Michael doesn't mind, I saw this movie for free. Hi, Harvey!!Michael raises some interresting points about our health care system, but like his other movies, doesn't offer any opposing viewpoints that are presented as just as valid as his. Such a thing would provide, dare I say it, CONTEXT.His visit to Cuba is complete BS. Wow, Cuba has fantastic health care. They also don't have to worry about pesky things like elections and free speach.Tell the WHOLE story, Michael."
5,What a treat!,"I would never have tackled this novel if my daughter hadn't given it to us for Christmas and kept asking if we had read it. So when we needed a good book to read aloud in the spring, my husband and I began Our Mutual Friend. What a treat! I am amazed by any novelist's ability to create an array of characters and circumstances and then weave them all together in surprising ways. Dickens not only does this with great skill; he is also a caustic satirist of great humor, an absolute genius of character study, and a spirited social critic to boot. When the wicked finally get their comeuppance, those who apply the verbal medicine do so with an articulate fervor that is deeply satisfying. Not always an easy read, this book is definitely worth the effort."
2,Haven't read yet print to small,For me the print is too small and I can't read it even with my glasses on. They should make the book a little larger.
3,To many subplots,"The main plot of murder and the person in disgust really drive the story, but all the subplots in the book is quite tedious. It makes you feel like u want to drive through those part, and get at the heart of plot. But all-in-all the novel ends w/ everyone deserving what they got, as a Dickens story should be."
2,Boring,"While the main plot is interesting, the book has about 25 other sub-plots that aren't. It is just too many characters and too many subplots to be enjoyable. Reading it and keeping track of everyone is a full time job. The book was critically known as Dicken's failure."
2,Boring,"Sadly, this book was just too boring for me to continue with. Not even the possibility of finding LOST answers can compel me to trudge on."
2,An Unhelpful Introduction,"The two star rating is aimed at the introductory material chosen by the editors of the Modern Library Classics Edition, not at all at Dickens' novel.An introduction should facilitate the reader's comprehension of the work. Particularly, one expects Modern Library editions to be demotic, helping keep classics alive for readers who are not up to speed on high toned literary criticism.The essay by Richard Gaughan which was chosen to ""introduce"" Dickens' most complex and difficult novel requires more effort than the work itself. Not a good situation."
2,Meh,Not a Dickens fan. Bought it for a reading group. Read about a tenth of it and just didn't feel like reading more.
3,Great imagination to bring new life to a familiar story,"Jesusgate warps time to bring the reader to the investigation of the death of Jesus as it would be done today (good and bad goverment officials plus journalists trying to beat each other to the scoop). Grayson Warren Brown uses his imagination to give a new slant on the Roman politics and the Jewish leaders at the time of Jesus. My only disappointment in the book is that the author did not give us a sense of what a Western world would be like if it had experienced all of the history up to the 20th century, but without having yet experienced Jesus."
4,Pretty good album,"The songs on this are pretty cool and enjoyable, but where is ""Bang bang to the Rock N' Roll""? which was played in the movie during the part when the FF are learning to live with each other. I really loved that song and they didn't put it on the cd. That's a huge bummer. So because of that I give the album only 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Not so hot.....no flame on!,"Mostly to my ears the same old stuff. I liked the vel. revolver tune. I did hear a cool FF theme song called ""the fantastic four song"". I downloaded it from iTunes. It seemed more in touch with the FF."
2,i bought this cd for one reason,"I only bought this cd for one reason...Taking Back Sunday. But even that was a disappointment. Their song ""Error Operator"" isn't really that great. But TBS is amazing so that's why this cd deserves one star. The other star is for just the other random songs that I enjoy here and there. I think the soundtrack is a really weird mix of songs and artists it doesn't really feel like any of it goes together. The rap songs are good for cruising around though."
4,That missing song is...,"This is to the reviewer, eric, that missing song you're talking about is called ""Counting Bodies Like Sheep To the Rhythm of the War Drums"" by A Perfect Circle. I actually stumbled upon the song when I was ripping it to my mp3 player and now I listen to it over and over and over again...it's an awesome song!"
4,Eh....it's so-so.,"I am not gonna say but the album, but again, it actually doesn't suck. If you compare it to the queen of the damned album, then it comes nowhere near it. It does have some pretty good voice talent in the way of ben moody, anastacia, lloyd banks, chingy, and others. You aren't doing yourself a favor by buying it, but it isn't worth skipping over. Look into it only if you liked the movie OR you like the artists. 'Nuff said."
4,A Treat For Your iPod,"This CD is jam packed with music, and all are great walking or running songs so throw this one on your iPod and go. ""Everything Burns"" with Ben Moody is a fantastic dynamic song and I expected it to figure more prominently in the movie. Ryan Cabrera, Breaking Point and Chingy are personal favorites for me with my top favorite being Omnisoul's song, ""Waiting (Save Your Life)"" - I am definitely looking for more music from this group."
4,Be the first person to say...,"I'll be the first person to say that this album was successful. Even though I didn't like some of the music, I like the album overall. You wouldn't be dissapointed if you liked the musics that were in the movie fantastic 4. A mixture of pop and ballard. 1 thumb up!"
3,sturdy plastic shovel,"Haven't tried it yet, but with my experiences in the past, I like the metal reinforcing on the plastic scoop. Handle is very sturdy too."
2,"The shovel that shows in the photo is not what was shipped to me. The shovel I recieved had no strip, and is not good con.","I was extremely disappointed. The item does not match description nor does it look like the photo displayed. It is not worth the price I paid.I will not purchase from this dealer again. It looks like something a child would play with, not something you would push or shovel snow with."
4,It works,"It works. I've never shoveled snow before, so I have no idea how it compares; but it's light; holds lost of snow; and made it through the snowiest, coldest Iowa winter in 30 years (so the locals tell me; I'll believe it when it's not this cold and snowy next year!:-)"
3,Not ready for prime time,Not a quality effort. Needs more background vocals and a professional arranger. Good regional effort but not yet ready for the big time.
4,Good Product for the Money,Good product for the money. Sometimes difficult to find things with the monocular and does not work as well with lots of foliage but the image is great when you do.
1,Read it... It's legendary,"I was very disappointed with my purchase of the Yukon Ranger digital night vision. I gave it 1 star due to being non user friendly. Although the unit works fine, I can't help but be completely blinded by how bright the unit is when looking at night, my actual night sight is destroyed. The picture quality is great when you are able to focus the unit but if you want something that you can actually be mobile with then this is not the unit for you. The viewing screen is extremely small to the point of not being able to see very well and trying to focus the unit in a fast and efficient manner is not going to happen, especially on objects within about 15-20 feet. In complete darkness you can see very well but then say try walking around or moving the unit away from your eye, you are then worse off than if you had nothing at all. I would save up your money for night vision that will be more mobile oriented and user friendly."
1,it was dum,"The giant hogan match, was the dummest match ive ever seen. The only good thing was that the dugeon of doom was in it, otherwise this pay-per view sucked."
3,Halloween Havoc 95 review,"The Giant Hogan war of the monster trucks was sweet, and the Giant falling off Cobo Hall was hilarious. Check this tape out if you want to see some funny stuff!"
5,Funny,"this PPV was so funny, it was probably the worst PPV ever but it gets a five because it was so damn funny. As a wrestling PPV it gets a 1 but as a comedy it gets a 5. oh god, i'm still laughing at the yeti."
1,Kindle Version - Poor Quality,"Just purchased the kindle version of this book. The visual quality of the content in this book is poor. I purchase almost all of my books now using kindle and I'm typically pleased with the way that most pages appear in kindle. However, the kindle version of this book is very difficult to read. I would advise potential customers to avoid purchasing the kindle version of this book."
1,Ridiculous product,"At $... on Amazon sale I ordered this product hastily--thinking I knew what a thermos was--without reading details. To my regret. A thermos that isn't good for travel? And isn't good for dairy, for juice, or for carbonated beverages? To me, this is as close to useless as a product can get. I mean, I suppose it looks fine in an iMac sort of way. But, I own two and they sit in my closet."
4,Meaningful upgrade...,"The Jawbone replaced my Motorola H-700 headset. In comparison, the Jawbone is better built and designed than the Motorola, which is incredibly flimsy and cheap in appearance (and also ages very poorly...mine died after a year's use).On the downside, the Jawbone is larger and heavier than the Motorola, but it works far, far better, providing a clearer call with higher volume. It's even better for those on the other end of the line due to the noise-reduction circuitry: I went from my office, outside, to my car and was driving for 20 minutes before I mentioned to my wife that I had changed locations; she told me that she had no idea that I'd been moving, and had assumed I was still in the office. Excellent performance.Battery life seems fine (bear in mind, I've only owned the thing for a week). I'm glad I upgraded: It's more expensive, but it's worth it."
3,Jawbone fit,"I bought the jawbone for two reasons; I saw it on a collegue and liked the looks, I read the reviews and was impressed with the noise cancellation technology. The reviews also had a lot of complaints about the fit and comfort of the headset and I probably should have paid attention. It is very uncomfortable - I worked with it a lot, as I was highly motivated to make it work and sometimes it did feel ok but I wasn't prepared for not being able to shift from one ear to the other as I could with my Plantronics and the earbud kept coming off until I finally lost all of them. Some reviewers recommend using buds from another manufacturer (sorry can't remember the name now) and I didn't try that although even Jawbone tech support made the same recommendation when I wrote complaining about the fit.I lost mine last weekend and was surprised to discover that I wasn't all that disappointed and have little inclination to replace it.Where is that perfect wireless headset?"
1,"ILL FITTING, AND NOT THAT GREAT LOOKING","I bought a Jawbone about two months ago after seeing the early reviews and commercials about the noise reduction technology and designer styling. After constantly struggling to have it stay in my ear far enough to hear on it, I'm giving up. I've tried all the ear loops and earpiece attachments, even tried attaching an additional Jabra eargel I read about to help keep it in place and none of them help achieve a snug fit that will stay in my ear. As far as the styling, it seems big and clunky to me, sort of a good looking design in the box, but a bit goofy looking on the ear. I've just ordered my third Plantronics 510, (I lost one and broke one)which is still the best fitting, best performing, and most comfortable for all day wear and heavy use."
3,not all its hyped to be.. works ok but is flimsy and always loose,"I gave it 3 stars because it does work, and is better than other bluetooth headsets, although:-flimsy construction-charging cap on back doesn't stay on-doesn't stay snugly attached, very loose always feels like it will fall off if you move your head-you can't play music from an iphone into it, its a headset only, so you need to carry around 2 sets of headsets, one for music and one for phone, this is kind of retarded, they couldn't just add another bluetooth profile? This isn't a big negative though because most other bluetooth headsets are designed just as stupidly.bluetooth headsets are an emerging technology, it just isn't quite there yet.I have kept mine so far and didn't return it because I guess its the best one out there but it really isn't that great. Unless you really love bluetooth headsets I wouldn't recommend it for you."
1,"Big, Poor Fitting, And Not That Cool Looking","I bought a Jawbone about two months ago after seeing the early reviews and commercials about the noise reduction technology and designer styling. After constantly struggling to have it stay in my ear far enough to hear on it, I'm giving up. I've tried all the ear loops and earpiece attachments, even tried attaching an additional Jabra eargel I read about to help keep it in place and none of them help achieve a snug fit that will stay in my ear.

I've just ordered my third Plantronics 510, (I lost one and broke one)which is still the best fitting, best performing, and most comfortable for all day wear and heavy use."
1,Worst Bluetooth I've owned,"To reviews by other disappointed users, I'll add only that it's supremely uncomfortable and that almost everyone on the other end complains that I'm going in and out whether I'm in a quiet room or in my car with the windows up."
2,"Won't stay in my ear, flimsy","This headset works pretty well with good noise canceling, but it won't stay attached to my ear so the part that rests on my face loses contact. At most it will stay on my head for 10 minutes. I find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place. The second one I got (the first was missing parts) came apart when I tried to unplug it from the charging cable. Jawbone does not seem to offer any other buds (not even spares) so I just ordered some Acoustibuds in the hope that I can actually use it. If they don't work I will try a hack I saw with a Jabra eargels product - that involves cutting up the supplied earbuds and gluing the eargels to the locking piece. I will update this review once I get it to work (or not)"
2,Nice theory - Poor execution,"My first JawBone stopped working after 3 weeks of light use. When I made calls, I could hear the person I called but they could not hear me. I guess the ""noise cancellation"" had its opinions about my voice :) Seriously, I tried using it with an iPhone and a Motorola V3c, then turning the noise cancellation on and off before I finally RMA'ed it for an exchange.My second unit appears to be working so far, but I've only had it a week...Now about voice quality: Compared to my 1-1/2 year old cheap low-tech Motorola HS805, the incoming voice sounds tinny. It sounds like the treble has been turned up, or the dynamic range is really narrow. To be fair, I have been told that my voice sounds OK and that the noise cancellation does seem to work well.In the end, I have second thoughts about spending this much on a product that delivers marginally better voice quality with a big question mark on durability and reliability."
2,Great when it works - a paint when it doesn't - it's sitting in my desk from now on,I read all the reviews and have tried to love this product. I purchased this two months ago and I can't get it to work for me. When I am in the car or in a rush and try to put it on I can't get it to sit correctly against my jawbone and this causes it to not hear me. The biggest problem is that you don't even know it's not sitting correctly until you are on the phone with someone and you can hear them but they can't hear you and they hang up on you.When it works - it's great. No one can hear your surroundings and the quality of the speaker is good. I just can't get it to work consistently.Long story short - I tried to make this work but cannot rely on it so it's now sitting in my desk drawer as I search for a new headset.
4,Much better than I thought it would be!,The Jawbone works flawlessly. Make sure you read the back of the manual first. The back of the manual describes easy ways to customize your Jawbone without breaking it. It works as a bluetooth headset for the PS3. Very pleased with my purchase and the Amazon price!
4,Don't take my word for it....,"This is the first Bluetooth headset I've tried so I have nothing to compare it to. I will say, however, that I am very satisfied with it's performance. The noise shield seems to work well, maybe not as well as they would have you believe, but people seem to have no trouble hearing me while I'm in my Jeep with the top down. The battery life is more than enough for my purposes. The ear fit is a little tricky. I use it in my left ear and there doesn't seem to be a perfect fit combination, which is a complaint I read when researching it. All I can say is: I like it, but I wouldn't pay full price for it, but then again I don't buy anything at full price...."
4,"Jawbone the best so far, but not perfect","We purchased the Jawbone to replace Motorola HS850 bluetooth headsets, as we found the HS850's to have volume problems on both ends. We compared the Jawbone to the BlueAnt Z9. We found each unit had pros and cons, but the Jawbone was the best of the bunch.It had the best sound quality, both for others to hear what was said, and to hear what others said. It was quite easy to use and VERY comfortable to wear.The one drawback we found is that sometimes at the beginning of a call the headset would not work. Specifically, we could dial from the headset via voice dialing, or we could pick up a call via the headset, but the voice would be on the hand set. The only solution that we found when that happened, was to turn off the Jawbone unit and turn it back on. In that reguard, the HS850 had the best operation."
2,piece of junk,This item falls apart quickly. It could have been that the OEM product that I purchased was used but it is a cheap POS for what you pay. A much better alternative that is similar in sound quality is the plantronics 520.
3,Disappointed Hubby,"After researching these devices thoroughly, I settled on this one. I purchased it for my wife who does a lot driving and talking on the phone. She hated it, claiming it didn't fit her ear. I ended up using and thought it fit perfectly. Unfortunately, the back-piece that plugs into the charger was loose. I was able to deal with it, but after a while, it just broke. I had it for five months. I ended up with a less-fancy motorola at half the price that is more straightforward, goes on the ear easier and others claim they can hear me better. Go figure. Great idea poorly executed."
1,What A Waste,"This is without a doubt the worst product I have purchased on Amazon. After reading the reviews AND going to the Apple store who said ""this was the best"" I have found it to be the worst. Other than getting it to pair with my iPhone it has never worked no matter what I try. There is a YouTube video that is quite clear about setting it up. However, what he shows in the setting up process my iPhone has never, EVER prompted me for. Not much response from Ailph. So, I have a $100 piece of plastic. Stay away. There must be other products that actually work. Here in CA we are not allowed to talk while driving holding a phone. So back to the drawing board."
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed in this product. It claims to have great noise reduction, but is not any better than my previous headset that cost half as much. The sound quality leaves some to be desired. It can be a pain to fit. It was not comfortable or very secure with the ear buds included so I purchased the gel ear plugs. This made it more comfortable but even harder to fit in the ear. My occupation is outdoors and very active and I fear losing the headset because the headset becomes dislodged from the earplug which stays in the ear. The ear hook is very poor. I wish I had made another choice."
4,Good buy.,"This BlueTooth ear piece kicks a**! I have tried a couple different BlueTooth pieces before buying this one. The Jawbone does a good job filtering out alot of back ground noise, as well as fitting comfortably in the ear. Not once has anyone I've been talking to on the phone asked me to speak up or that they couldn't hear due to outside/background noise. The controls could be better on this thing, but...ya can't have it all."
3,Jawbone,"I have purchased 4 Jawbones over the past 5 months...3 as gifts, 1 for me and 1 replacement when my original was lost. The first 3 were of better quality than the one purchased last week. The ear buds on the first 3 fit well and locked into place securely. The ear bud on the last unit fits poorly and easily comes off in the ear canal. Jawbone customer service promised a call back from the warranty department several days ago that has not happened. The call quality is great. The fit on the new unit is poor. I would avoid purchasing a Jawbone until the ear bud fit issue that I have experienced and others are commenting on in online reviews is resolved. The great call clarity is useless if the device won't stay in the ear."
4,JaWbOnE,I bought this for my husband and he likes it except sometimes itr doesnt work right because of his beard (it has to be touching your face to transmit) other than that it is great !!!!!
1,Bad ergonomics,"I can confirm what has already been said by numerous other people who used Jawbone - good looks, bad ergonomics. It's a shame that the company which designed such a beautiful product failed to do their homework with regard to practicality.Jawbone keeps falling out of my ear. Period. I tried different loops and ear pieces - none of it helped (as experienced by many other people). I asked my wife and several of my friends to try Jawbone on - all of them felt uncomfortable wearing it, for the same reason of bad ergonomics.Apart from bad ergonomics, noise cancelling feature ""clips"" the voice too - most of the people I called using Jawbone complained they cannot hear me well.My advice - don't buy it."
2,looking for a better bluetooth,"I think this operated about as promised but I just couldn't get it to stay in my ear. I tried all the different attachments, I switched from the right to left ear, but nothing worked. Perhaps I just have strange ears. I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use. It isn't a visible button, but a thin place in the plastic covering that you press to turn on/off. Amazon took it back and refunded everything, so I'm using a cheap motorola headsetNew Bluetooth Headset Black Hands Free Bulk Packageand liking it better (for now)."
5,JawBone Bluetooth,I puchased a Plantronics 665 and it was horrible for the person on the other end. Lots of noise. I tried talking with several people and they all complained. I sent it back and exchanged for a JawBone. The JawBone bluetoothe is amazing. People do not complain at all. Everyone says I sound really clear. I even have my radio on and the road noise in my car is loud. I would recommend this Bluetooth as #1 to anyone that talks on a cell phone while driving.
3,Jawbone,The earloops and earbuds included with the unit do not fit snugly. They take a lot of messing around to get a comfortsable fit. I've managed to break 3 of the 4 earloops included with the Jawbone.
5,Outstanding!,"This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. It filters out noise in most every environment in which I have used it: airport, car, street, etc. It could fit a little better, but it is so superior to any other headset I have used that I can overlook this minor annoyance."
1,Aliph JAwbone Bluetooth Headset,"Sent as Christmas gift to my brother, based on his review of product performance - product did NOT perform as advertised, static on calls, disconnected calls, etc. He returned for different manufacturer (Plantronics)and model. Bluetooth headsets MUST improve before they're ready for ""prime time""."
3,"Great sound, but only fair ear fit, and poor construction.","The sound and talk quality was great. This was my 4th bluetooth headset, and had the lowest noise of all. But after talking more than 30 minutes, the ear piece hurt the back of my ear. Also, the charger was challenging, and would stick to the unit. Occasionally when I pulled it off the charging cord, the plastic peice from the back came off. I now have the Platronics Voyager 520 and like it much more. Better ear fit, and sound is 90% as good as the Jawbone. The Jawbone could be great overall with just a few design changes."
2,Not for big ears,"I think this product is fine for most people. The microphone is good and the noise canceling filter is okay (tested during windy day + lawn mower in background). As far as fit, I could not use the around the ear piece nor the in-ear piece. In order to make the device work for me, I used a Jabra earpiece without the around ear piece. The Jabra earpiece is a tight enough fit in my ear so the jawbone stays in place. I think Jawbone needs to explore additional fitting options.I am interested to try the Cardo S-800, as a friend of mine (with big ears) likes it."
3,works fair to poor,long distant calls have an echopoor sound quality but little better reception in the car on the freeway
1,Don't buy it.,"Given the price, one would expect quality construction. However, despite the hype, sound quality isn't as claimed, with persistent echo. Also, the ear wire snapped off inside, rendering the unit useless. Having never subjected it to any abuse, I'm way less than impressed. Save your money."
3,Good and bad for the Jawbone,(pros)The sound quality is even better than the phone headset and the noise feature works great.(cons)The fitting for the left and right ear requires separate process.Put it on to the ear (for me at least) requires two hands at times or front of a mirror and the changable ear buds are loose and can come off when putting the headset on.
2,ALiph Jawbone,Well for the sound quality in the car it is great. Go out side and this thing goes to crap. It picks up wind noise and starts breaking up on both ends. I also had the ear loop break off at the base. I guess thats why they give you 4 ear loops because your going to need them. I tryied to contact the Company with no luck of any return calls. I hate to say it but buy something other than this item.
5,"So far, so good ...","This is the 2nd BT headset I've had and this one gets along much better with my Verizon-network LG vx8100 that my Jabra did. It doesn't turn itself on in my pocket, no-one complains about echoes or static and the noise shield technology seems to have improved the sound quality from everyone's perspective, including my own.What I'm waiting for is for something to break however since almost everyone asks if I've broken the clip or the earpiece yet but like I said - so far, so good.Finally, the price was the best I've seen and paying just a little extra for shipping got it to my door 2 days later. No complaints."
3,Kind of good...,"When this product works, it works well... However, it sometimes doesn't work, or seems to no longer be paired with the iPhone. Also, the earloops are cheap. I've broken two so far in trying to make minimal adjustments. They seem to bend too easily, and when one bends it back in place, it snaps off. I'd like to see aftermarket versions that I can customize to my ear better without worry of it breaking."
5,Wonderful!,Thank you so much for getting the book to me so quickly. My husband was so happy to get the book. It was exactly the way you described it and even better. He is enjoying the book. What a great experience it has been dealing with you! Thank you!
5,Quick & Handy,I love this saw. I have it sitting near my bench for the times I don't want to drag out a power saw to make one cut. It folds up nicely so you could keep it in a tool box with out worrying about damageing the teeth or your fingers. Cuts very quickly.
4,Tajima GK-G210,"I Pick this tool up every day. When I can't bring the work to my power saw, I bring this saw to the work. Folds up and fits great in my tool pouch, can't say that for other pull saws. Holy #$%^& is it sharp. Only gripe is the nose lacks the ability to cut clear thru if, for example, I cut baseboard which is attached to the wall, the nose hits the floor and can't make a complete cut."
4,G-Force Tuff,"This is one tuff watch and keeps perfect time. The only thing negitive about this watch is that it is hard to see the display in dim light.The data bank keeps just enough # of your important phone numbers (24).You can keep pin # or SS # in the bank instead of phone #S. If you are looking for a tuff as nails work watch with a little something extra, this is the one. It is well worth the money. jtabor3"
2,Too small!!,"First, we never received the injector or the thermometer. We cooked a 12.5 lb. turkey and barely had enough room. I feel it is too small, mainly too narrow. We do not have original package or I would return it."
2,low btu,"unit came as a mush waited for Christmas present. Too bad it came with the burner and regulator for a small pot. Took over 2 hours and 15 minutes to heat oil to 360 degrees. What a shame.I will be returning all, as I do not trust this product. Also there was no customer support on weekends (when most people would be using this porduct.) Very unsatisfactory."
3,Disappointed,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my parents, they were very happy with it. However, I was disappointed since my parents had to buy a thermometer and injector that was suppose to be supplied with the package."
2,didn't work,"Our husky just pulled and pulled, it didn't seem to help at all. And then he chewed through it. YAY"
3,"Good, but only if this is your taste in horror","The film is well done, but for me, unsatisfying. I prefer supernatural horror which this is not. _SPOILER_ It is pure sadism/torture."
3,TOUCH THE BEAST,"As a child Quaid (Shaun Evans) witnessed his parents murdered with an ax as a child. He has nightmares and hallucinations about it. In college he gets together with two other students, Steven (Jackson Rathbone) and Cheryl (Hanne Steen) to do a study about fear and dread. Once the interview stage is complete, Quaid wants to take his study to the next level by making people face their fears.The film has all the elements of a good horror slasher: decent build-up, characters, nudity, cute ending, and some originality. For some reason it didn't grab me like it should have. Perhaps it was the non-likeability of Quaid, or the softness of Steven's character.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Erin Gavin, Laura Donnelly + others)"
1,dread - ful,"I do not recall reading the Clive Barker story from which this was adapted. So, I can't tell you if this is a good adaptation or not. I can tell you if it is a good film, and the answer is no! It seems the film took quite a bit of time to make you familiar with and like the characters, (spoiler alert) just to chop 'em all up and destroy them at the end. The thing about torture movies like Hostel, that makes them worth watching, is the victim/hero finally gets revenge in the end, and we cheer when the sadist/torturer meets his demise. The ending of this film was just too dismal and after all that time (over an hour) of character developement, the ending just doesn't pay off. The dread comes when you realize you spent nearly 2 hrs. watching this dreadful movie."
2,Fairly lame,"Rounding out this year's lineup of the After Dark Horrorfest is Dread, produced by none other than Clive Barker and adapted from his own short story as well. Twilight's Jackson Rathbone stars as a college student who partakes in the documentation and experimentation with people's fears, as convinced to do by his unhinged colleague (Shaun Evans) who has a dark and shady past. You can probably see where things end up going from here. While the atmosphere of Dread is admirable, the pacing and scares of the film are pretty much off-kilter. The actors involved don't do much to help matters here either, and as a whole, the film is fairly predictable, albeit its conclusion does come off as somewhat of a surprise. All in all, as far as Clive Barker adaptations go, you could do worse, but you could wholeheartedly also do much better as well."
4,surprisingly awesome,"OMGosh, this was an EXCELLENT horror flick! We watch lots of DVDs and are always on the lookout for great horror movies. Mission accomplished with this one! I stumbled upon it and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Vegetarians are a pet peeve of mine, so I especially enjoyed the closing scene which involved steak, and later, Stephen. Good stuff!! (mwhahahaha!) Based on a story by Clive Barker and all-around excellent, quality entertainment. Highly recommended!!"
3,It was okay..........,Clive Barker is a genious but with this I feel he missed the mark. This movie has its moments but you cant help but keep thinking that there's something missing. One of the weaker films at this years horrorfest. If anything id recommend this as a rent.
1,HUGE LETDOWN,I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS THING HAS MORE THAN 1 STAR THERE SHOULD BE A NO STAR RATING.SEX AND NUDITY ALL OVER THE PLACE
2,DREADHEADS,"The After Dark Horrorfest IV has really been disappointing this year. DREAD is certainly gory and at times downright disgusting, but in spite of all its moralizing about our hidden fears and ""facing the beast"", it's ultimately a victim of its own self-indulgence.TWILIGHT's Jackson Rathbone does give a good performance, probably outshining most of his more well known TWILIGHTERS and Shaun Davis is frightening as the demented Quade; all the acting is good, but lost in the movie's self explosive script. Few Clive Barker transitions to screen have impressed me and this one is no different. I may avoid Horrorfest V if this year's crop is any indication."
2,dread? not the short story...,"Ok How many people read the short story from Clive Barker? Well I can tell you straight up the differences as I've just finished reading the story. There's no girl with a huge birthmark in it, no third unknown character that gets his eardrums exploded and a few other descrepancies oh and the psychopath actually gets what's coming to him.This movie is nothing like the short story except it's got Clive's name on it. Otherwise seriously read the short story. I found it a lot better then this movie."
4,A Glowing Partnership Chronicled,"DePalma's best films, excluding ""Sisters"", were made in collaboration with Venetian composer Pino Donaggio, and herein lies an overview of those years ('76-'93). Since then, DePalma has gone on to make some risible films with other composers.While these are RERECORDINGS, they are smashingly close to the originals, and the sound quality is STUPENDOUS.What makes this all worthwhile even if you have the scores to ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" is the inclusion of piviotal themes from ""Body Double"" and ""Blow Out"", two great scores that never saw full release on LP or Disc due to exorbitant union re-use fees (no label would cough up the costs). ""Blow Out"" gets the short end on this disc, though, whereas the original European release of this comp included more cuts from ""Blow Out"".However... ""Love and Menace"" from ""BOdy Double"", and the disco-oid ""Theme from Body Double"" with Donaggio's trademark female ooh-aaaaaaahs make this disc very valuable."
5,Great for Beginners,"I bought this book recently when I got into HVLP spraying. It's a great introduction to techniques, equipment and safety. The tip that the tip of a HVLP gun tends to get blocked quickly when spraying water-based finishes is worth the price alone!"
2,Review by AG,"This book didn't really open my eyes to a lot of things. A large portion of the book was on finishes and what they do ( the kind of info that you in book about finishes). I am not a professional but an amateur, most of the info was common knowledge/sense. The book was well written but I thought that it would have contained more detailed info like specific hose and coupling sizes,volume of airloss:effects/prevention, and listed sources for obtaining related products."
4,directions and applcations of spray finishing of furniture;,"I think this would be a great first, beginner book for the just beginning painter of home-made furniture. It could show more patterns for the experienced woodmaker, but overall, it's a good book."
1,Not worth buying.,"At first look this series seems to have a great idea. Basically you have a young man who is the god slayer and a mysterious magical girl!! Sounds epic when you just read that, but unfourtunatly the voice acting is terrible, as is the directing. It is not funny although it does try to be and it does not do enough to really grow the characters. I can not beleive that I wasted moments of my life watching this show."
3,Windows 95 Users Don't Buy This,"SONY only provides USB driver for Windows 98. Don't buy this product if you have Windows 95. Or you'll have the same problem as I do now. Your options are to upgrade to Windows 98 or buy the floppy disk adapter. Either way, you'll be spending more money. As for me, I'm returning the camera. Too bad, because I like the camera itself."
4,"Solid camera, but...","I just purchased this one for a trip to Greece, Egypt, and Israel. I was very pleased with the battery life. I'd plug it in every night and it would last all day with no problem. The picture quality is excellent during the day and night. If you make the purchase, you'll need another memory stick. I got the 64 meg stick (Ken Tracey) and could take 112 shots at the highest resolution. I blew up a few of my pictures to 8x10 and the quality was quite good. If your planning on doing that though, I'd recommend the 2.1 meg Sony. All in all, I'm a happy camper"
4,move over 35mm!,"This camera is an excellent mid-range product that is option-packed. Even the low rez pics are high quality; I've got an HP 952c printer, and unless you look close, you can't tell that you're looking at a digital picture. Editing pictures on the fly is a snap. The only complaints I would have is the low 4MB Memory stick it comes with, and it's a little slow when taking action shots (for an extreme amateur photographer like me, I need every advantage I can get!). Sony continues to have my vote for high quality electronics."
4,My Sony Dsc-s30,"I love Dsc-s30 digital camera it took pictures really clearlyBecause I compared to others same level camera no one I like it.The screen LCD is so greatest to view the pictures I took. It cancover to protect the LCD screen. Nice looking ,good style.But it can't take motion MPEG movie So ......I bought a new oneI still chose Sony dsc-P50....Ha Ha Dsc-s30 still my best one.S30 battery life is longer then s-50 . It also can play MPEGmovie in Dsc-s30. Greatest I love it..."
5,great camera,i think the dsc-s30 is the best digital camera sony has made. its the only one i know of with the flip screen.
4,A bedrock for serious Security Profesisonals,"I bought this book a few weeks ago while searching through the IT books section. Being in the IT Security field for over 7 years and remembering some of my earlier days, I decided to buy it. Overall I liked how Ms. Harris broke out the ethics and laws. Most of us in the field know there are laws, but never take the time to sit down and absorb them. The coding stuff was the best and more up my alley. I've seen too many security professionals who don't know how to code and coding IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL YOU CAN LEARN. This book cleanly broke down C, Assembley, and some sample exploits really well. I was able to brush up on my Assembley and learn some cool tools in the process. If you've read Hacking Exposed and want some more fundamental information, read this book. You'll really like it."
4,Great book,"What a great book. From no skillz to haxor writing shellcode, I'd recommend this to any academic institution wishing to teach on security. The first few chapters aren't overly exciting, but finding a book that gives fair coverage to topics like Linux shellcode development, client-side attacks on Windows, IDA pro usage, fuzzing, and more is no easy find!Great job guys!jrod"
1,NINETY MINUTES POORLY SPENT,"By now I have read several of Paul Strathern's ""90-minute"" introductions to individual philosophers, each no longer than the average magazine article. Strathern always sketches the philosopher's life and personality vividly, but there is so little detail or substance you wind up with only the vaguest idea of the man's philosophy. Such was the case here with Wittgenstein, whose work is skated over with laughable superficiality. Avoid this silly series."
5,grievous error!,"Adagio for strings never appeared in Full Metal Jacket, you are thinking of Platoon......................silly person. I never heard this soundtrack so I have said all I have to say."
1,Terrible...Just terrible,"werd y'allthis movie is badmur F is c U l werd but lil bowwowow has C orn rows, o KSERIOUSLYwerdpeace outmanwerdy'all"
3,Good movie but would have liked to have seen a more serious adult ending.,"I think if Lil Bow Wow's character would have died or been murdered with his corpse being shown in gory detail and his surviving teammates having to play without him in tribute it would have made for a better ending. That's just me personally, but if this wasn't a family film the lead character dying with the surviving characters carrying on in his name/memory would make for a better story."
5,I love Bow Wow's movie......,"I love Bow Wow's movie Like Mike because it's funny and he is so fine!!! I am one of his biggest fans and I will always support him. The movie had a lot of NBA stars. Morris Chestnut was in it which makes the movie good also!! I really love this movie along with the soundtrack which is tight.So keep doing what you are doing Bow Wow because you are very talented and so cute...Holla,Bow Wow's #1 fan."
1,VILE! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! 1 OUT OF 10,"This movie went down at #2 on my top ten worst movies list. This movie is devoid of all things good and fails in everything. The story sucks, the characters suck, the humor sucks, and the special effects are very cheesy. Not even the hot cheeleaders will elicit any excitement because of how bad this movie is. Don't buy it if you value your soul and don't want to lose it to the poisonous suckage. If you watch it have someone break the disc shortly afterwards and call a priest to perform an excorcism on your DVD player, your TV, in fact, your whole house."
4,Great fun for the whole family!,"This one surprised me. I expected it to be a little more hard, having Lil' Bow Wow as its main star. But BW, as I like to call him now, surprised me! He's a hell of an actor, and has a great career ahead of him.As the older rappers pull the young kids into their ""good 'ol boy"" network, I hope that the quality doesn't start to take a dive, as it did, when this behavior was prevalent in the White corporate world. But given that I have not seen that yet, I hope that BW continues in his career to Rap Stardom!Peace!MC White said: Ch-ch-ch check it out!!!"
5,I think the video was cool!@,I like how they put the real life basketball player and other people in it. It was cool to make Bow wow play like michael jordan. I think it is cool to have someone in it that is smaller than real life basketball player.
5,Reviewed by Joseph Tartaro in The New Gun Week,"Joseph Tartaro, President of the Second Amendement Foundation, reviewed Patrick's ""National Rifle Association and the Media"" in Gun Week. Says Tartaro:""Having read many of the books which have delved into the long public debate over guns and gun regulation, I can say that Patrick's book plows really new ground, and deserves careful reading by any activist engaged in that debate. The National Rifle Association and the Media offers an original approach that is backed up by careful research and analysis....This is not just a book on the NRA: it is about the role of the media in an age of enhanced public reliance on communication media."""
3,"Good cookies, bad shipping",Individual packs of cookies were packed into a larger box with cases of pop tarts next to them. Of course the cookies were smashed during shipping due to five pounds of pop tarts repeatedly smashing into them. One of the dumbest packaging mistakes I've ever seen.
5,I would recommend this coffee maker,"This is the second Black and Decker Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker we have owned. The first had a glass liner in the carafe. The current carafe is insulated metal. There is only a slight difference in the length of time the coffee stays hot. Our coffee is hot all morning and by early to mid-afternoon is starting to cool a little. The beauty of a thermal carafe is that the coffee doesn't sit and ""cook"" on the burner all day making it taste bitter and ""old"".I like this coffee maker and would recommend it to anyone. With all thermal carafes, the pot is smaller than a regular coffee maker carafe and one must take that into consideration when deciding on a thermal carafe. The quality is great and the timer feature is fantastic when we want to have our coffee ready for us when we get up in the morning."
4,Black & Decker Coffee Maker,"I originally wanted a different model (which was discontinued), but I like this coffee maker a lot. It really keeps the coffee hot for quite a while. We use it at work and everyone has been happy with it so far."
1,"Lukewarm, metal tasting coffee","I purchased this coffee maker for the size and style but was very unhappy with it. Even when first brewed, the coffee isn't hot and there's a strong taste of metal in the coffee. Several washings in hot soapy water and several pots of coffee did nothing to get rid of the metal taste. I'm definitely throwing this coffee pot BACK."
5,Amazing Value,"Incredible value & functionality! We love the thermal carafe and the autostop feature. It's also very easy to use. Makes better coffee than our old Delonghi at half the cost. The only nit is without any water indicator, and you can't see the water level in the carafe, you have to measure out the water you're putting in. But not a big deal for us."
1,Don't waste your money,"Unless you like cold coffee, this coffee maker is pretty much useless. Machine functions as do most except there is no heat plate to keep carafe warm. And the carafe does not keep the coffee warm but for a few minutes. Even if you preheat the carafe, which is a nuisance and waste of water and energy, the coffee is still cool within minutes. One must also use a measuring cup for water to accurately determine the number of cups to be brewed as the carafe has no markings for number of cups. Again, a nuisance. Useless and worthless."
1,Back & Decker Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker,This thermal carafe does not keep the coffee hot long enough to qualify for a thermal carafe unit - probably less than 2 hours and it was only luke warm. I would not recommend this item.
2,If you like the taste of plastic.....,"then this coffeemaker is for you. While my first cup is hot enough, it doesn't stay hot. The second cup has already cooled way too much. I find myself nuking at the second cup. The lid is very awkward, holds liquid inside that is difficult to get rid of, stains my sink if left to drain out. I do like the coffee basket, comes out easily to clean. Not too difficult to pour water into the tank, but the level indicator is hard to read. Makes coffee really fast which is the very best thing about this one. Bottom line, some pros some cons, as with all machines. But the deal breaker is, I can't get rid of the plastic taste. I've only had it a couple months and I'm looking to replace it. I have another Black & Decker flagged as it's gotten almost 5 stars, but I'm scared it may, too, have that awful plastic taste."
1,Ruined too many mornings,"Every few weeks, the filter collapses and coffee spills out over the counter and onto the drawers and floors. There is no predicting when this will happen. I finally threw it out. And yes, I am using the filters for the 8-12 cup coffee makers."
4,does exactly what it should do - not foolproof,"This unit does exactly what it is designed to do - make good coffee.The stainless steel carafe is very solid (that's why I bought it, so it won't break), and has very good thermal insulation.The lid can be put on wrong if you dont't follow the instructions, so it's not fool proof.Same can be said about the filter holder. You can put it in wrong, but it still works except for the ""steal a drink"" feature.Just make sure it is seated correctly before you use it.I have had this unit for about 6 weeks, and the only problem I have noticed is that the white arrow (alignment marker) on the carafe lid is starting to wear off.Otherwise, I expect this unit to last a long time.Also note that there is no heater plate because it will not work with an insulated carafe.Good unit for the money."
1,Leaks Water...,"I tried to use this three times, leaked water all over the counter every time. Threw it away. Horrible product."
2,Not worth it,"I don't recommend this product at all. I have to put every cup I pour in the microwave first. I think the fact that the lid has been designed to retain liquid, which you can't drain, says a lot about the lack of thought that went into this product by the designers at Black & Decker."
1,Worst coffee maker ever - will ruin your marriage,"In a word - terrible. Carafe design is deplorable - makes a mess when you fill reservoir with water, and when you pour your coffee. Although ours is the white model with the heated plate, the machine and carafe are identical, only glass, and with a warming plate. I tend to use the grab-a-cup feature, which causes a drip every time I do, which in turn has led to the coating on the plate to peel away. And we've only owned it for about 4 months!I hate this coffee maker more than I've ever hated any small home appliance I've ever owned. I'm not kidding, my husband laughs at me but is equally frustrated with it. We're going back to Proctor Silex or a Mr. Coffee."
1,"Don't buy it: leaks, leaks, and leaks",I strongly recommend against buying this coffee maker. Coffee oozes out of the carafe (between the metal and the plastic) both during brewing (long before it actually reaches that level) and during pouring. A puddle of coffee on the counter after every cycle.
5,Great coffee maker,"I just purchased this great coffee maker. I am very impressed with the speed of the brewing cycle and how hot the coffee is after the brewing process. It is definitely faster than the Mr. Coffee thermal this one replaces. The thermal pot does an excellent job keeping the java warm. It is set to brew at 7:30AM, but this morning didn't get to it until two hours later and it was very close to being as hot as fresh brewed, probably a combination of a hotter brewing cycle and efficient thermal pot. Don't overlook this coffee maker. BTW, this replaces my MC 10 cupper which I mostly had to throw away the last 2-3 cups everyday anyway."
1,DISASTER!,"We bought this at Target only 2 weeks ago, and already it has exploded coffee all over the kitchen counter twice. The instructions say if you don't attach the lid correctly, this will happen. So I take pains to insert the lid correctly (which took some practice after the little markers wore off after only a week). It explodes with no apparent reason. So, on top of having to clean up the mess first thing in the morning--without having had any coffee--I have to also bleach all the countertops because the coffee stains so bad.Don't buy it!!! If you must, at least keep the receipt (I wish I had)."
1,Avoid this model,"My last Black and Decker coffee maker lasted 15 years and made great coffee. This model is a disappointment. The carafe leaks and doesn't keep the coffee hot. The ""first pour"" coffee isn't very hot either."
1,Quit working after 4 weeks,This coffee maker quit working after 4 weeks of use. We called the service number and they want us to PAY shipping to send it back instead of issuing a RA number. I will never purchase another B & D appliance again. Worse customer service EVER.
2,Poor technology...,I bought this coffee maker 3 months ago and suspect I will be replacing it soon. The auto-timer/clock display feature does not stay fully lit. Parts of the numbers keep disappearing as well as the indicator light for am and pm. Several mornings it failed to automatically start brewing. Don't waste your money--this unit is garbage in my opinion.I've owned black and decker products before and have always been pleased with their quality and performance. Apparently they can't make good coffee makers. Lesson learned!
2,"it makes coffee, but...","Yes, it makes coffee, yes it is a stainless carafe. No, it does not make a superb cup of coffee and it wastes a lot of very exquisite coffee if you try to make a halfways strong cup of anything.Basically, the problem is that the water flow through the basket filter (if I had known it was a basket I wouldn't have bought it in the first place) is far too fast to allow for any sort of flavor to come through. It makes for watery, acidic coffee regardless of the bean or the grind.Very disappointing and ho-hum, but I guess I got what I paid for."
4,The product meets my requirements,"The coffeemaker performs as I expected, it meets my requirements. I do like the thermal carafe. I don't use the programming feature, so I can't comment on it."
5,The Truth about Christmas,"This new documentary is a surprisingly compelling look at the true story about the birth of Christ, and the deeper meaning of that birth and its impact on the world. With a fine cast of experts, teachers and authors, especially Peter Kreeft, Tim Gray and Fr. Mitch Pacwa, who offer powerful insights into the many important, but often not known, details about the birth of Christ, this film tells the ""story behind the story"" that includes the many significant events leading up to the Nativity, as well as those crucial details connected to this amazing historical event that have impacted our world ever since. Plus a lot of fabulous classical art, and some great footage from the Holy Land. This excellent documentary really does a great job of presenting a wonderful overview on this stunning event in history that we celebrate every year but sometimes forget the incredible spiritual meaning of it. Highly recommended."
4,"Great, but maybe a bit small","The pan itself is well-made and the nonstick coating is superb. I found it so easy to toss/flip food around in this wok that I didn't really need utensils. I cooked on the electric element on high temp setting, but the handle stayed cool! The flat bottom does away with the need for a fire/stabilizing ring. My wife seemed to think the pan was heavy, but I thought it was just right and well-balanced. In fact, I feel that the 10"" pan may be ideal for perhaps only 2-person meals. I stir-fried a pound of shrimp in it, but the pan seemed almost full to the brim. IMO, this pan is perfect for making fried rice because of its nonstick surface and the ease at which you can flip/stir the contents in the pan. Also, it would be nice if it had a lid..."
4,"Not the greatest for stir-fry, but useful nonetheless","It doesn't quite get hot enough for stir-frying on my electric stove, and there's no lid for it (unlike my 12-quart chicken fryer) but I do get some occasional use out of it."
5,Calphalon Magic,"As I have come to expect from Calphalon products, this pan is amazing. It heats evenly, and cooks very well. Highly recommend buying Calphalon products over other cheaper cookware... Even if you have to buy them one at a time to handle the cost ;)"
2,not very non-stick,I find the Cal. Comm. non-stick to not be very non-stick after a few years. I've had mine for about 8 years and my fry/saute pans are terrible for sticking though I have scrubbed them repeatedly with Soft Scrub and a Dobie pad as recommended. Save your money.
3,Awaiting final resolution,"After I ordered the Motorola Phone Tools package to use with our V557 cell phone in concert with our Windows ME PC, we went on a trip. When I returned 3/13, the package was there with the indication on the outside of the package that it contains the software and the USB cable I wanted. Upon opening the package, there is no cable!I have returned the product, requesting replacement with a package that actually contains the cable.I await satisfactory results."
1,"Good idea, poor execution","I agree with the music lover from Florida. That high pitched flute is annoying. I was very disappointed after receiving the 3 CD set. A CD that I enjoy much more is ""Mozart for Mothers-to-be"" by Philips Classics. The cover looks corny, but the music is wonderful."
2,More of a Mixtape..,Apathy's presence on the mic is one you won't forget but this particular album is. More of a mixtape and Apathy compilation- there really isnt anything that sticks out. More lows than highs. I will give his new album 'Eastern Philosophy' a good listen but this album is a throw away. Makes me wonder...Is Apathy just a good cameo rapper?
2,Repeated main music theme,"Very nice, but the main theme is repeated too much. Disappointed in that the sound track is incomplete without the Irish tune ""I'll Tell Me Ma""."
3,Chemical Immobilization Review,"Chemical Immobilization ReviewThis book explains how to tranquilize animals by the means of a blowgun, a tranquilizer rifle, or pistol. It explains dosages for all animals from bear to deer to dogs. The book also explains where to shoot the animals. The book also tells what needles to use and their sizes from a half to two and a half inches. It explains which drugs to use and which give the best effects for different animals."
5,BEYOND THE CLASSIC POINT OF VIEW,"If you wanna to read the Prophet's life but from a different perspective and in a magnificent way of grasping the issues,you are on the right way.Be sure!"
4,An easy read - historically valuable,I enjoyed the book for its historical relevance. Madiba speaks plainly and gets the message accross factually. This books makes you think if you are a white South African - even if you were to young to know.
4,Proudly South African,This is a book which every South African should read at least once in their lifetime. How can we know where we are going if we don't know where we come from?
2,Late,"Arrived in good condition, but I was told it would arrive between Dec 27th and January 12th--I didn't get it until January 19th. Can't necessarily blame WorldofBooksUSA though. Apparently it shipped from London the 21st of December. Who knows."
5,My Heart Soars,This book is a must have for any seeker of love or God. I carry it in my purse all the time. Any time I have a few minutes I pull it out for a delightful moment in the presence of God. I can read and re-read the poems and I never get tired of them--each time there is a different twist or something new in the meaning. It is like having my own secret treasure hunt of love. I would recommend this book to everyone.
1,DISGUST!,"Ladinsky admits in the introduction that he does not speak Persian and has given up studying it. What would you say about a translator of Shakespeare who does not speak English? However, if you prefer sweet new-age songies about the dolphins, go ahead. You'll love this.Such bull can only pass for real in this country."
5,amazing poetry,Hafiz writes with passion and sweetness. His spirituality and deep love of God pours out of him and into each line. I'm hooked on Hafiz! I will have to get everything he has written!
1,Skip Ladinsky - read Hafiz,"Once again, Ladinsky claims to be presenting English speaking readers with the work of the great Persian poet Hafiz, and once again, he hasn't felt the need to actually learn Persian or actually base these works on any previous translation of any poem by Hafiz. These are the poems that Ladinsky imagines Hafiz might have written had he been a twentieth century baby boomer Californian disciple of Meher Baba, instead of a 14th century Persian Sufi Muslim. Ladinsky believes (or claims to believe) that Hafiz told him these poems. If so, the afterlife hasn't done anything for the great poet's literary talent."
4,Reign of the Phallus,"I read this book for a seminar on Greek vase painting, it was the week of perceptions of women in ancient Athens. The book is well researched, if not well footnoted (similar to Zanker and his images of Augustus book). And like Zanker, she repeats information frequently. However, it is clear to see the attitudes of scholars in the 1980's from the way Keuls writes. Even if some of her theories has been debunked or improved upon, it is clear to see how foundational a work her book is. Keuls organizes the book in a way that is easy to follow and provides lost of picture evidence to support her theories. Definately an important book to read if you want to write about women in ancient Athens, or even in the greater Mediterranean world (it would be interesting to see her methodologies applied to other societies in the area)."
5,A Stunning and Finely-Crafted Book!,"There is nothing old here--this book is all new energy, confronting a much-ignored subject in American letters: interraciality and the politics of identity and gender. Kocher can't go wrong with poems like ""Braiding"" and ""My Mother as Daedalus"" which weave humor, wisdom and irony with the skill of a five-book veteran. I'm looking forward to the next one!!!"
5,nothing in previous literary work compares,"The poems and prose in this book make you want to laugh and cry,one of the most brilliantly moving things, I'veread."
1,Wrong product,"L'interdit was the product ordered, not Fleur D'interdit. I could not get through to the sender to make an exchange. Would like to receive explicit directions on how to exchange the product as I do not care for this sent at all ."
2,labeling tape hard to peal,The labeling tape is hard to remove from backing. You have to fold the tape to peal off but that usually is the place where it de-laminates and peals off the substrait.
4,A FUN COUNTING BOOK,"Here's a fun counting book for youngsters through the first grade.""One Cow Coughs"" is a rhymed counting book with bright collage-like illustrations sure to beguile those learning numbers.Taking place in a barnyard, we find after one cow coughs there are soon three sheep shaking and nine geese sneezing. And so it goes as the infectious wheezing and sneezing spreads.Not to worry though, a rib-tickling cure makes all of the animals feel better."
4,Easy and fast to prepare.,"We tried this product for our son who is 7 and gluten intolerant. It really is quick and easy to prepare. The servings are individually measured and comes with a measuring cup for adding water. The bread results are not really a whole lot like traditional sandwich bread. The single serve slices turned out with consistency more along the lines of a pancake and seemed a bit thicker than a regular slice of white bread. With that said, they worked out just fine for making PB&J; and my son had no complaints about the taste. (I didn't try the bread myself so can't comment on the taste personally).I recommend trying this out for yourself if you haven't found happiness with any other GF breads."
5,"Cool message, fantastic art","""He Was One Of Us"" is a rich and thought-provoking collage of painted imagery and handwritten notes depicting the life of Christ. As an artist, I'm especially enamored of the artwork: it's the best I've yet seen from Poortvliet, and in the same class as work by the likes of Frazetta and Pyle (no really!). Facile, concise brushstrokes, an almost peerless command of anatomy, and a nice sense of mood combine to make this one of the best ""art books"" I own. Check it out, and see why Poortvliet has been called ""the greatest living Dutch artist."""
5,Magnificent,"When the book first arrived, I just flipped through it quickly and wasn't overly impressed. Some of the pages looked like the artist was simply sketching ideas for characters. Then I sat down and read the book.The story is told through the pictures. The text is sparse, but amazingly powerful (albeit slightly difficult to see on some of the darker pages). By the time I got to the end I felt like I had been on a journey and had just returned to the present.I would not have believed that a book could be that compelling."
1,bad job,this is the second time I have been asked to review this purchase. It was represented as new but had a written dedication on the fly leaf! There also was a piece torn out of the inside front cover.If I had not needed to gift it ASAP I would have returned it.Alice
4,The Glove,"The Mizuno Franchise is a very well made product. I am a new First baseman, and I find the glove to be a great help at fielding this position. I recommend this Glove to any and all First Baseman........"
5,Great book!,"I thought that this was a really good book. I would have to say that my favorite charater would have to be Claire. (even though she can be really mean sometimes) My least favorite was Aaron, no doubt about it. Claire and Aaron are dating. But what Claire dosen't know is that Aaron sees this other girl named Mia when he is not with Claire. He never tells Claire. She finds out when Mia leaves a message on the answering machine and Claire heals it. Mia said on the machine that she would come and watch Aaron sing that night. (some of his friends and him have a band) Claire is also going to listen to Aaron sing. What will happen? Will Claire and Mia see each oter? And will Claire break up with Aaron? Read the book to find out! ..."
2,Quality not quite up to par.,"Purchased the gloves with new charcoal smoker. Although they work O.K., I felt the quality of the gloves wasn't quite up to par. Internal lining of the gloves around the thumb was loose creating issues getting your thumb placed correctly. Also, thought the gloves were a little tight on my hand."
2,They're not oven mitts,"I thought these would be good heat-resistant mitts, until I almost burned my hand transferring a cast-iron pan from the grill to the adjacent patio table. I guess I should have read the description better, for using them as potholders isn't really advertised.They may work well for what's in the description, but I need to keep looking for some good mitts for handling hot pans."
1,Where is it??,"Ordered this item on December 19, 2010 along with several other items from this seller. Estimated delivery on original order was between December 23, 2010 and February 11, 2011. As of January 1, this item has still not arrived. Granted I am still in the window of their promised delivery. However the availability of the item is currently listed as ""In Stock."" But on my order, the expected delivery date is now listed as between January 25, 2011 and February 11, 2011. Seller is not being truthful about availability of item. I plan to cancel this order and purchase from somewhere else, as everything else has promptly arrived. Luckily this was not a Christmas gift."
3,"Good, but not so heat resistant","These gloves are good because they cover the whole hand and wrist, allow for good manual dexterity, and stand up well to abuse.My only gripe is that they allow a lot of heat in, eventually. Sure, you can grab a hot cookie sheet from an oven, but if you leave the glove on your hand for 10 seconds that heat is going to transfer and make it very uncomfortable for your fingers. So if you use them, make sure to take 'em off right after you're done grabbing the hot stuff."
4,These are NOT fire-proof,"Don't get me wrong. I love these things. The only problem is that they're not entirely heat-proof. They're meant to be used when handling hot stuff, not to be confused with handling fire. I have several scorch marks on my gloves because I wasn't careful with them. Use them as the manufacturer advises; as an aid to handling utensils and food on a hot grill. If you want something fireproof, buy something made of asbestos, but be prepared to pay a lot more money for them."
3,just OK,"I bought these to do outdoor bbq. I had expected they would be more heat resistant than they turned out to be. will keep you from getting burned at least, and they are comfortable to wear and use. not too bad for the price..."
5,THESE GLOVES ARE HANDSOME & HANDY!,"These handsome royal blue gloves hang on a hook right by our patio door. They're safe for grilling over hot flames, and tending to a smoker, too.I use them for bringing wood in to the indoor fireplace - they serve as protection for all kinds of work that might leave splinters or thorns.Almost best of all - they're unisex - large enought to fit my husband comfortably, yet I can use them, too.Talk about going hand in glove!"
4,Wonderful cooking gloves - would be even better with hanging loops,"I love these thick, high quality gloves. I use them for the grill and in the kitchen. They protect my hands from heat really well. Also, we have a gas stove and we've burned many regular cotton oven mitts. These gloves seem flame resistant and have not been burned at all - which is why we purchased these.The only disappointment is they don't have hanging loops, so we have to leave them on the counter.Another thing that annoyed me some is the product description didn't indicate $14.95 is for a PAIR of gloves, not just one."
2,Used to be much better,I just want to reiterate the comments below that these gloves used to be much better. I just mildly burned myself moving a beer-can chicken from the oven to the stove - maybe 10 seconds at 350 degrees? The old ones would've never done this. I am switching to something else.
4,"Good story,Confusing Message!","I liked this story a lot! It was fun to read and the charaters were interesting. I liked Peejoe's character as much as I disliked Lucilles'. I wish the ending would have been a little different. I felt bad for Dove because he lost everything just for doing what he thought was right. I hated the way Lucille got off free. Overall,it was an enjoy- able story worthy of reading."
3,"Good, but not the best","Crazy in Alabama was an okay book. It had many interesting parts that were entertaining, serious, and humorous all at the same time. There was, however, a lot of boring, dull parts that counterbalanced the good parts. Even though I liked the book at the beginning, I thought it was a little drug out in the end. I was ready for it to be over. Overall, I liked Lucille better than Peejoe, because Peejoe was so boring. Lucille had a lot of interesting adventures that were better to read. This book was good, but I don't think it was great."
4,an off the wall story that kept my attention all the way.,"Crazy in Alabama is exactly that, crazy. I liked lucille's chapters better than peejoe's, but his seem like they could really happen. I didn't exactly like the fact that she was set free by the judge but I knew it would happen. I would recommend this to anyone looking for something funny."
3,"For being so crazy, it's a little dull.","This book is nutty.For all intents and purposes you're reading about a highly unstable and demented woman (Helllo. Driving cross country with your husband's decapitated head in a hat box...please pass the valium).However, Childress' character depiction is such that Lucille appears zany if not mildly schizophrenic. It's because of this that I was honestly more drawn to her story as opposed to Peejoe's. In my case, the dual storylines just created an overall dragging reading experience.In any case, if you're in the market for something a little quirky, this is worth the read.Rating: 3 out of 5 starsSuggested With: Sweet Tea"
3,Woman Scorned,"This is a funny tale of a woman scorned. Though I saw the movie before the novel, I was still pleased. This is a book for anyone who has been in an abusive situation and taken action against her abuser."
5,"forget the movie, read the novel","Wonderfully entertaining piece of work. If you see the movie after reading the novel, you will be sorely disappointed."
4,"Compelling story, very entertaining","This book is very fun to read. Even though it is a quick read, there's plenty of depth to the characters and the two plots. It's a form of literature that leaves you smiling and then after you've put the put the book down makes you think about its significance."
4,"Wacky, hilarious, outrageous ...","...but there's a solid message buried not too deeply in this book. In part it's another southern coming-of-age tale, but it's somehow greater than the sum of its parts. Terrific story telling and utterly outrageous scenes. The thought that even a little bit of this is probably based on something that really happened is too delicious to contemplate.Read it and laugh - and then think about it a little more seriously."
5,The Change,This book is a great portrait of life in the south during the change of segretation. Mark Childress really depicted a great tale of adventure and danger in this novel.
4,A reaffirming experience.,"Beyond the humor and eccentric characters is a nobel character, buried amid his insensitive, neurotic family. Dove Bullis is a good man with all the fine qualities that his family must have to survive Southern hypocrisy and bigotry and growing up. Although not everyone survives the oppression of the time, he rises above the chaos, and insurmountable conflicts to allow most of his family to escape homelessness, the death penalty, ridicule, dessertion and abandonment. He embodies humane and unconditional love and strength. Funny, yes! But it is so much more than that."
5,A classic American novel!,"This is a funny, witty and thought-provoking book. Aunt Lucille is now one of the great characters of American literature. I will be ordering every book Mark Childress has ever written -- hopefully they will be half as wonderful as I found this book to be."
5,Accurate and Entertaining...,"I grew up in Alabama during the 60's and ""Crazy in Alabama"" is so accurate in the details of the ""goings-on"" of that time. I loved the book. It was so entertaining and made me laugh, yet made me somewhat ashamed for being from Alabama. The prejudice that was depicted of was so true-to-life and that prejudice still, unfortunately, exists there. I am so looking forward to the movie and think Melanie Griffith is perfect for the part of Lucille."
3,Not so crazy about this book.,"I usually don't care to much for double sided stories but I wouldn't have been able to read this one without the chapters of Peejoe to help me along. I thought Lucille was a selfish slut who only cared about what she got. Peejoe on the other hand actually tried to help someone besides himself. I wouldn't reccomend only writing just Peejoe stories though, unless you like being depressed. Overall the book wasn't too bad."
3,Crazy in Alabama Review,"This book was entertaining and contained various moral messages, it held my attention and was an easy read, however there were two stories that could have been better if left by themselves. There was the profound and serious racial story and the morbidly funny Lucille on the run story. It was odd and original to see them combined, but I don't know if it was a good thing."
4,An entertaining escape,"Crazy in Alabama is an engaging, quick read. We follow two developing stories: One of Peejoe, a young boy thrust into the racial conflicts of the mid-sixties in Alabama; the other of his Aunt Lucille, a woman on the run in search of fame in Hollywood after she murders her husband. This is an amusing story, but I have one quibble. I felt the two stories just didn't mesh well together. Peejoe's story is serious (told, however, in a lighthearted manner). There are deaths, lynching, sit-ins, etc, in other words, much food for thought. Then we have the Lucille story. She drives cross country with her husband's head in Tupperware. She makes it big in Las Vegas and makes her way to Hollywood. It's like a warped little fairy tale that just didn't fit in all that well with Peejoe's story. Despite that quibble, Crazy in Alabama is a fun book to read and is ultimately satisfying."
3,Crazy is putting it mildly!,"I found the story of PeeJoe and his crazy Aunt Lucille to be a wickedly funny book with dark undertones.In the time of serious civil unrest in Alabama,the parallel stories both have moments of hilarious comedy and frightening truths about the way people see each other in their different worlds.Lucille decides that she's had quite enough of her appalling husband who,she's convinced,has been the sole reason for her not being a famous movie star.She therefore slips rat poison into his coffee and after cutting off his head(with great difficulty)pops it into a Tupperware lettuce keeper-I'll never be able to look at mine in the same light again!She then sets out for Hollywood,complete with the head and starts the great adventure.Meanwhile,PeeJoe is caught up in the civil rights confrontations and quickly learns that he will never again see life in the same way.I can't imagine anyone NOT liking this book and intend looking up the other things that Mark Childress has written."
2,Should have expected it......,"These are cheaply made and get very hot - once hot, dont respond well to water..... my fault. the KC's that rapidly replaced these may not be american made, but they are made more american than these!"
3,MORE BRITISH UNITS!!!,Och where are the Highlanders? if there were Highlanders this game would rock! If there were a whole frickin' Scottish playable country it would be the best.
2,unreasonably realistic,"the game is too realistic to produce any fun. there are lot of things which the computer knowns and the players don't. unfortunatly the computer gets a head start at things. the realism takes the fun things out of it. unreasonable things also go wrong in this game. characters don't follow what u tell them to do, it should be that way!"
4,Good cool Game But............ Need for Major Improvement!,"Ac Is 1 of the best games ive ever Played It has good Graphics. takes place in America,And preety Accruate in Historical Info.Dispite all of these cool and good things there is still some Major Improvement1. Ships move to Slow2. Cheap, Annoying Music3. Not enough Nations4. U Need a fast Comp 2 play if u dont have 1 then The Game Sux5. No Senario Editor6. Finnaly It is 2 hard 2 capture Cities and poor Statuse for Units"
1,Won't play on Vista or Windows 7,"I loved this game when I used to play it on XP: the graphics were beautiful, the gameplay intuitive, the campaigns interesting. But I can't find any way to play it on Vista or Windows 7. The colors are all screwed up, rendering the game essentially unplayable."
2,Outdated,"This game might have been good 15 years ago but it is far out of date now. The tiny little people rushing around are difficult to control and the game is just, well, primitive. Go for something more modern, such as Civilization."
4,can be a pain,"We like this playpen but it can be alittle more cumbersome to set up. Especially the sunshade. But we love that it has that and it has the rugged jeep look. Plus, it has a nicely padded pad.and the mesh sides. I like that it can roll while in the bag which my Graco can not do."
3,The rails drive me crazy!!!!,"This play yard is very difficult to set up and take down! Also, the pad in the bottom is an odd size. I don't know if the sheets that you can buy (like for the pack n play) will fit. I've been nervous to buy them and then have to return them.I would recommend trying out the taking apart and setting up part in the store before taking it home."
3,This is ok...,"We picked this for our son because it had the shade on top and also the drape on the side thinking it would be great for our trips to the beach in the summer, which would be often. NOT! This is not an easy playyard to travel with. If I have to go somewhere that I will need this I dread it! It is VERY easy to set up though its VERY HARD to take down it always takes both of our patience levels to take it down. By the time I get it down my wrists are sore and my patience is SHOT!Overall, we like this playyard if we use it in our own home as a playpen or as a bassinet when he was an infant but to travel with it is a nightmare. Though i dont know many people who have ever said that any of these things were ever easy to get down.Hope this helps!"
4,Can't find better,"I bought the playard as a travel bed and something for my son to play in when we visit friends.Pros: Very easy to assemble and clean. Changing table is great to have. My son loves the vibration. Pockets on the sides help keep everything within quick reach.Cons: vey heavy- but can't find a lighter one that is as good. I've been using the playard almost a month and it can no longer play the music / sounds. My son enjoyed these and they helped make changing time more pleasant.Overall- would buy again, and really like this. Buy mattress pad to keep everything soft for you little one and they help when the expected accidents happen"
2,Don't waste you're $$$,Initially I thought this playard was great....that is why I registered for it. It was easy to set up & take down the first dozen or so times but after that one side kept getting jammed & it wouldn't unlock and would take numerous attempts to get it to budge. That & the fact that this is pretty heavy made it more trouble than it was worth to take anywhere so in the trash it went & I bought a Graco which I love.
1,Do not buy this playard,"This playard is very difficult to open and close. My husband had a hard time putting it together and he is very good at putting things together. While he was assembling the playard, a bar broke. We finally were so frustrated, we returned it to the store and bought a Graco Pac n Play. The Graco Pac n Play was much easier to put together and much easier to open and close."
5,Excellent Purchase,"Me and my husband bought this play yard when my son was too big to fit in his bassinett. He is currently 6 months old, 27 inches & 20 lbs. He is STILL able to use the bassinett feature of this play yard. The material is very durable. The musical feature lulled our baby boy to sleep MANY times. And even when he is sleeping in his crib I remove the box from the corner of the playyard and put it in his crib with the music playing. I have purchased the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for his crib which is nice but he still likes the music of the playyard music box. And the storage pockets on both sides of the playyard are fantastic not to mention the shade to go over the top to protect them from the sun or other lights. It's a great purchase. You won't be disappointed."
4,Bought several sizes - suits me fine.,"I bought this pan to make bread and meat loaf, and it works just fine for that. The pans so far are holding up well. I bought mini and medium sized pans of the same brand, and I would buy them again."
5,I knead dough,"The item is two bread pans that are excellent products. I have used them more than a dozen times, so far, and they are in excellent shape, showing they will be so for some time."
5,An incredible book!,"I own over 10 different pinball books which I've bought over the years but none of them comes REMOTELY close to this one. This is an exhaustive book which has over 300 jam-packed pages of information. Every imaginable feature that has ever been in a pinball machine is documented in great detail throughout the book. There is even a chapter which talks about and lists every video pinball game ever made for home video game systems and PCs! If you have even a passing interest in pinball machines, you must have this book. Period. The price seems a little steep, but when you hold the actual book in your hands, you'll know where that money went...Stunning!"
5,"fantastic photos, enthusiastic writing!","the photos alone make the book worth the money, and the writing is enthusiastic, comprehensive, and very readableall time periods of pinball (except the most recent 1990s and new century) are well represented"
5,Pinball Wizard,"This is a great book to learn about the history of pinball and it's mechanisms. It covers past and present innovations in pinball plungers, flippers, coils, sound, etc. Lots of color photographs of classic machine's playfield and backglass will satisfy a pinball lover's appetite for pinball art. I highly recommended this book as a good introduction to pinball's colorful history."
3,Great coffee table book,"Great photos, looks great,but not much hard info. Good addition if you like pinballs and even interesting for the avg person but short on in depth details."
5,Worked out just fine - exact replacement,"Pay attention to the way your vehicle is assembled before you tear it down. The ""R"" and ""L"" stamped on these was opposite from on our S80 Volvo. (I suspect this product has multiple vehicle applications.) Otherwise, worked great without problems."
5,The first pre-dreadnought,"Monitor skillfully holds the reader spellbound about the ship, and her irrascible genius inventor. I also came to realize just how technically advanced this ship was compared to her contemporaries. This book is a quick and powerful read that you don't want to put down, and it conveys the depth and level of accomplishment achieved by John Erriccson in getting her built in the short time he did. An outstanding history replete with circumstances and entertaining anecdotes as well. A highly recommended book."
5,A perfect book for history buffs.,I am a seven and a half year old who is crazy about history and naval ships. I read this book and feel that it is absolutely the best book for naval history buffs like me. I can't wait to read it again and again.
5,Space and Writing,"I found this book to be quietly revolutionary in its very conception. The author and photographic collaborator set out to show how physical space influenced and stimulated various well known American writers. They look at both the writer's residence and personal writing space within that structure. As an archaeologist I spend much of my time looking at how artifacts once served to reproduce worldview. Much of that interest in my field has followed Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus. This book does the same in that it looks at how home and writing space might stimulate both thought and words. And this is done in an absolutely stunning fashion with thoughtful text, quotation of relevant passages from the writer, and striking illustrations. Any one with an interest in writing, writers, history, photography, architecture, or material culture (as well as the just plain curious folks) will welcome this book as a holiday gift."
5,The Tropical Fish Bible,"When I was raising (yes as in breeding) tropical fish & belonged to a club, THIS was The Book everyone had a copy of. It covers species, breeding, disease, plants, everything. You will never need another book on tropical fish if you have this one."
5,Oustanding reference guide for your aquarium,"This is kinda like my bible for aquarium shopping... want to know which fish is good for a community tank? which isn't? Which ones like conditions that are similar to the temp and PH of your existing tank? Really, you just can't beat this book. Get it"
4,You can't get a better reference for the money!,"Dr. Axelrod's Mini-Atlas is by far the best pictoralreference book for freshwater fish. With more than 1800photos of fish from every area of the world, you're sureto find what your looking for.Each fish is accompanied by a pictoral reference of itsfeeding habits, reproduction type, lighting requirements,temperament, tank setup and swimming habits.This is a great book to start your research into fish thatyou are interested in keeping."
2,Value is questionable. Not for a beginner,"There is no doubt this is a comprehensive visual encyclopedia of many, many fish species.If that's what you want, buy this book.If you want care tips for any of the fish listed, you probably better find another source. I'll admit I'm a beginniner at fish keeping, and maybe this book will grow on me, but I'd recommend you spend your money elsewhere.The care section for the different breeds is sparse to say the least. There is usually a key under each photo which tells what the fish eats, where it swims, whether it is good for a community tank. This might be all you need, but I felt I paid too much for what I got."
3,Mainly pictures,"If you want tons of pictures this is the book for you. My main problem with it was that it did not have any individual information on the fish other than than a small picture guide of temperature, size, ph, etc. I think it would be 5 star if it just had a few sentences on each fish for a little more information."
5,Anna Nalick is real,"Okay, so I had heard Breath on the radio but I was hesitant to buy the CD. How many times have you bought a CD because you heard the single on the radio and the rest of the album sucked? But I lucked out, I won tickets to a gathering that included Anna, her band, a DJ and about 20 of us around a conference table. We got to chat with her and she sang for us. She has such a sweet delicate voice, that one of the men who won tickets (he hadn't heard her before), at the end, just said, ""Wow!"" And we all agreed. She is a real person with a lot of integrity that truly values her credibility when it comes to song writing and doesn't want to be pigeon-holed with the rest of the 20-somethings out there. I then got to see her open up for Rob Thomas where I heard the rest of her album. Amazing, and a great performer. I think she sounds even better in person, and shouldn't have any problem breaking the mold!"
1,Very Disappointed :(,Although the artist of this cd is amazing the people I ordered it from sent me the wrong cd. I was very disappointed as I got shorted 4 songs in the cd they sent. And the artwork was different on the cd they sent me. I will not purchase anything from Newbury Comics again :(
5,"""Consider This"" A Fantastic Album","Buying cds can be hit or miss, and I was essentially flying blind when I bought ""Wreck of the Day"" (I had only heard ""Breathe (2AM)"" on the radio, but for $1.00 at Dollar Tree, it was worth the risk.)I can't tell you how ecstatic I was to find that there isn't a bad song on the whole album, and that the sound and styles vary pleasantly. Some are bright and catchy (""Satellite"" and ""In My Head""), while others are mellow with a little melancholy (""Wreck of the Day"" and ""Catalyst""), and the tracks alternate nicely. My two favorites have to be ""Citadel"" and ""Consider This"", and the only song I find a little stale, ironically, is ""Breathe"" (only because it was overplayed on my local station).Anna has a beautiful voice, and her craft for storytelling in each song is a testament to her talent as a musician (""Paper Bag"" is an especially touching, upbeat example.) If you're on the fence, give the samples a listen and buy it - this album is a gem."
4,Fresh POP!!!!!,"Anna Nalick have a sweet and emotional voice ""wreck of the day"" is a very good pop album to enjoy every day, in your car in your cd walkman in your home, ligth melodies and lyrics , no too complicated a true pleasure, i recommend , satellite, bleed, consider this and citadelHM"
4,An excellent debut... can't wait to hear more.,"I heard ""Breathe (2AM)"" played on XM Radio and I just had to know what else Anna Nalick had to offer... after snagging the CD (for only $9.99) I was pleasantly surprised by this great debut. As much as there aren't many other songs on the CD that are quite as ""pop' and catchy as the first single, there are some real gems on this recording. Some of the songs, especially the album closer, bring to mind the vocal talents of Fiona Apple - and that's quite a compliment. If there is anything the album suffers from (ever so slightly) is that a couple of the songs sound too alike as far as instrumentation and production goes. Overall though, a wonderful debut with no filler material. I can't wait to see Anna's talents blossom even further. Get this CD, you won't regret it."
4,She Speaks To Me,"She Speaks To Me... That's what I keep thinking when I listen to this CD. I enjoy listening to female artists who seem to relate to, not to mention have a knack for putting words to, all the things women feel. Artists who have that knack for saying what our hearts would like to, but often cannot. This is one of those artists. Other reviewers made the comparison to artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Alanis, etc.. and they weren't kidding. Anna Nalick is most definately going places and anyone would be wise to hitch a ride on her band wagon now.If you are already a fan of Anna Nalicks you may also like Martina Sorbara. I try to plug her any chance I get. She's one of the best new artists out there and hasn't been heard of enough.Cheers!"
5,I'll Take Another...,"I bought the original wreck of the day about a month after it was released and it is AMAZING. I was so excited for new songs that I bought this album too. Don't get me wrong, the new songs are REALLY good too. I just wish I would have known you can buy them on iTunes.My advice:If you do not own the original Wreck of the Day--buy this one insteadIf you DO own the original--buy ""Wreck 06"" ""more than melody"" ""drink me"" and ""soldier"" off of iTunes. (the album artwork is NOT worth your money).Also...If you like ""Breathe 2am"" and are not sure if you should buy an Anna album at all, my advice is DO. Breathe was the only song I had heard from her (and I only heard it once) before i bought the album"
3,First Two Songs are Great!,"The first two songs are amazing, but there isn't anything very memorable about the rest of the CD. I think there isn't enough variety. They are all soulful ballads. If you want to listen to ""break up music"" it would be a good choice."
1,Boring,"She is trying too hard to sound like other artists like another reviewer mentioned. This is nothing original whatsoever! The style, arrangements, songs are almost identical copies to other artists in this same genre!"
3,On the Fence,"I'm undecided about this album. I bought it, like many others, after hearing Breathe (2 AM) on the radio and being blown away. I've heard that she is supposed sound like Sarah McLachlan. Short answer: not really. She has a strong voice, but she needs to get her own sound, and grow a little more. A good debut, with potential, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I'd like to see Ms. Nalick get a little more originality, integrity: in short, to mature a little, and find her unifying own sound and style. With that said, this album has some good songs on it, like ""Breathe (2 AM), ""In the Rough"", ""Paper Bag"", and ""Consider This""."
3,Its a 3/5,"the infatuating song played on the radio (breathe - 2 am) made me buy the album, but unfortunately, most of the other songs aren't anything like it. I have come to enjoy a few of the songs, but some of them seem to be a strange mix of avril lavigne and britney spears...Overall, it's alright, but not my favorite."
4,"Great, in spite of over production","Agree with Moose that some of the production gets in the way. Actually, heard Anna Nalick for the first time Monday night on Leno, where she did Breathe with nothing more than acoustic guitar, bass and drums. I prefer that version to what's on the CD. All that aside, though, this youngster's brilliance as a poet and a songwriter still shines through. Hope Sony will favor us with a few less-cluttered cuts on her next album."
5,Great Music Beautiful Voice,I bought this cd after listening to Pandora and hearing some of Anna's music. Just off a recent break-up this is a great cd to listen to.
4,Anna Nalick Nails It,"A great album if you like a strong female vocal in your music. ""Breathe (2am)"" is a aprticularly great track."
5,"Strong, clear and pleasing","What we have here is a blend of Sheryl Crow and Natalie Merchant and the best of both. Great choice a material with Crow's strength and intensity and Merchant's smooth flowing voice, but without slurring the words of the song. This artist is going to do well. Buy it, you'll like it."
5,Hardly the Wreck of The Day!,"I rarely buy CDs, and when I do, I usually hate 3/4 of the songs. I bought Anna's CD after hearing ""Breathe (2 AM) on the radio. I normally dislike a song after a while if I hear it over and over again, but I noticed that I loved ""Breathe"" every time I heard it.Once I bought the CD, I realized it was the same with every song on the album. Every time I hear one of the songs, I feel as if I'm hearing it for the first time. Anna's songs are very easy to relate to, and they all show a lot of talent.I would definitely recommend this CD."
5,Pop at its best.,"If you had told me a month ago that I would later be buying any pop CD, it's quite possible that I would have... laughed in your stunned face. No, I'm more of an alternative rock kind of person. Yet, when one morning I threw MTV on and saw the music video on for ""Breathe (2 am)"" I had to know who this singer was. Once I found out, oh, it's someone named Anna Nalick, I was a little depressed, because I loved that song but I didn't want to waste my money on a whole CD of it. Then I used the thing to preview the songs and discovered that like 90% of the time I couldn't bear to see the 30 second clip end.Stand out Tracks: Breathe, Citadel, Paper Bag, Satellite, In The Rough, Bleed, Consider This.But all the songs would be considered Very Good in my book, at the least."
4,Amazing debut,"For a first release and being only 20 years old, this is an amazing CD. Nalick's voice and lyrics are what drive all of these songs. Her voice has a husky/dreamy quality when she's not trying to channel someone else (on 2 songs she sounds like she's trying to be Alannis Morrisette). The lyrics have to be listened to as they actually have something to say about life and how we get through it from one day to the next. Her grasp of language and phrasing is unusual for someone so young. The only problem would be with the music and a sameness that creeps in . Too often as the CD goes on, you wouldn't be able to separate Nalick's songs from a handful of other female songwriters. Overall this is a CD I haven't stopped listening to since I bought it a few days ago. My favorites are Breathe, Citadel and the lonely, sensual Wreck of the Day."
4,Soothing & Nice,"A lot of reviewers have commented that this album has a couple of good songs on it, and that the rest are just so-so at best. I disagree. Sure the first few songs are the best, so everything after seems to be a let down, but these are still very good songs. Anna Nalick has an exceptionally good voice. This is not regular radio drivel, nor is it 1-hit wonder material. It you enjoy lighter female singers - Tori Amos' and Fiona Apple's later stuff, Sarah McLachlan, etc - then you will probably like this CD.This CD may not be a 5 Star effort in many people's eyes, but I do believe that it shows that Anna Nalick has the potential to be a 5 Star artist."
4,Just Breath-something we all need,"This has some great songs. However, when you listen to ""Breath"" sit down, put your back, close your eyes and breath! Enjoy!"
3,Alanis like hit,"Bought this album on the strength of the US airplay hit 'Breathe' and was not disappointed, deserves to be a global hit"
4,Decent CD,I bought this CD because I could not get enough of hearing wreck of the day on the radio. I like half of the songs on the CD and love three of them.
3,Something to look forward to,"Anna Nalick has a great voice that conjurs parts Jewel, Amy Grant and Sheryl Crow. Like Jewel, though, her lyrics are a bit precious and as one progresses through this CD the music becomes a bit repetitive. It's well produced and performed and will appeal greatly to the college art student/poet set, but it wears thin as it wears on. That being said, I will predict that, like Jewel again, she will mature in her music and become quite the singer-songwriter in the future. That she writes her own songs is promise enough that she's no mere marketing gimmick. Check back with her when she's 30."
3,"Affordable set, but be careful","i bought this game specifically for knights of the old republic. all i can say is watch out. this game is so buggy. guess what, if you try to patch it, it wont work at all anymore. the version that comes with this set is still the very buggy 1.0 version. if you patch it to 1.3 it can no longer recognize the disk. there is no update for this version.i save every 10 to 15 minutes because at any turn it can crash and you will lose what you did.overall kotor is an awesome game if you dont mind waiting to restart every 20 minutes or so from a crash (literally), but i am getting sick of the crashes now"
3,"Decent game, with a major downside","The package is at a good price and has good games. It had one major downside for me though: More than half the games wouldn't work. The only two that i got to work were the galaxies and the empire at war. I didn't try the battlefront, because i have it on ps2. The games that work are great. I am really good with computers, and PC games, so i tried everything i knew. The games would just crash, or fail to load. It is a good price even if you only get 2 games that work, because you usually get each game for the price of the whole package."
3,"If you have Vista, save your money","Empires at War and Battlefront were good games. The others didn't work at all, even in compatibility mode. If you have Windows Vista, don't buy this. Just another example of why Vista is dumb."
2,Not Win 7 compatible,"Bought it, thought Lucas Arts would have a Win 7 patch, but nooooooo. It's is not backwards compatible either. Don't buy until Lucas Arts gets its act together!!!"
3,STAR WARS: THE BEST OF PC,"STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT & REPUBLIC COMMANDO ARE FUN BUT SHORT. I DIDN'T ENJOY EMPIRE AT WAR OR KNIGHTS OF THE REPUBLIC AS MUCH. I HAVEN'T FULLY EXPLORED THE LAST TWO YET BECAUSE KNIGHTS OF THE REPUBLIC'S TUTORIAL IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, AND EMPIRE AT WAR IS A GROUP COMMAND GAME, WHEREAS I LIKE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER GAMES ALOT MORE."
2,Problems and no support,"I have seen some reviews complaining about the quality of CDs and since I had this problem too, I wanted to make it visible. Tried my DVDs on 4 different computers which never had any problem with any heavier games, they would only work in one and only 2 of the 4 games. In fact the game behaves as if the CDs were not recognizable/authentic. It ""ignores"" them.Support outside the US is a subcontractor which basically makes you test the hell out of everything, upgrade firmwares and all kinds of stuff until you give up. And I gave up after 3 weeks. In the meanwhile you go to the forums and learn there were some bad manufacturing batches of DVDs but no one ever tried to check if mine were in those batches.My kid is very disappointed and so am I with this bad support. The 2 games I managed to start are fine though especially because the Star Wars magic is in there."
3,Does not run.,"It is true that the games on this DVD compilation frequently do not install and/or run. The compilation itself includes a layer of UI to install and run the games, so the binaries were definitely modified from the standalone. I am a computer guy and have multiple PC's and OS's at home, Win 7, Vista, XP SP2 and 3, even Win 2000. None of them worked, crashing at various points in either the install or initial game load. A couple of games crashed at random points - KOTOR almost getting through the first scene ebfore dying for example. I am not willing to sit through hours of support or download random patches from the Internet. Like everyone else, I bought it for my son, who was devastated as I struggled to get anything to work. Fail. I bought the Legos compilation and that works fine. I'm rating this a 3 because the games themselves really are good, just not this package. People probably ignore the 1 ratings - I know I did, and it would have prepared me for this. Don't buy."
5,"Star Wars: The Best of PC (Empire at War, Knights of the Old Republic",Picked this up for my laptop running windows 7/64 bit. It works just fine. Comes with multiple games. Was in great condition. Would highly recommend if the force is with you.
4,Awesome,This is an awesome bundle of Star Wars games. Well worth the price and you will not be disappointed as you play it.
4,Works on Windows 7,I gave this to my son for use on his new Windows 7 computer for Xmas 09. He enjoys the game and has no problems with it. Age 11.
2,Only playable once?,"I'm not sure if this happened to anyone else but it sure happened to me. I purchased the game and took it home..fine. I then installed and played each of the five games one after another...awesome. I enjoyed each one in full especially KOTOR. After wards i uninstalled each game so iI wouldn't have the excess memory taken up. But of course I am gonna wanna play these games again sooner or later but I didn't expect this at all. When I went to reinstall the Kotor/empire at war disc the drive wouldn't read it at all. No scratches no marks of any kind on the disc it just would not read. So I then tried the disc with the three remaining games. Well, the same thing happened. Overall I was only able to play each game once before the discs themselves wouldn't be readable. I give 5 stars for the games but 2 for the product"
4,Hey KOTOR will work on vista. :-),Just a quick note. I have a HP notebook model G60-230US with Vista installed on it. I had no problem what so ever getting the KOTOR to load and run. I dont know if a problem has been fixed but just so thought I would let everyone know. Being a huge Star Wars fan it was nice to this collection come out as I didnt get to play them the first time around.
4,star wars review,great game -wonderful effects and sound would recommend this game to any lover of the space games!!!
4,Great Teaching Tool,I bought this to use in my Kindergarten classroom and it has been a lot of fun! I want to order a few more tins and use it as an independent center for story retelling. The kids really enjoy moving the pieces around and changing the story.
2,Disappointing,I purchased this book for my 7 year old grandson who is biracial. He is having problems with classmates calling him names and I thought this book would show him that race has nothing to do with accomplishments. The book was a little to old for him. The pictures were very dark and not at all bright. He really didn't enjoy the book at all. I don't recommend this book for young children.
4,A Writer from another time,"Wright Morris is an American writer from another era, both in terms of his style of writing, his organization of materials, and his orientation toward the world. This book is in the style of High Modernism, but gently applied. Each chapter is written with the voice of a different character, and we return, in the novel, again and again to the character's voices. In the process, we learn more about them, and the central events which displaced them in their world. One is quaint: a kiss stolen on a porch in Nebraska forty years ago. That one kiss set this world on its end, and was a watershed mark in the lives of three people. This book is charmingly quaint, and its repetition, meant to add knowledge, never quite evolves beyond a few central points. That said, for those with the patience for a quiet read, will find much to like in The Field of Vision."
3,very average in terms of performance,I am spoiled I use the classic and buying this was a mistake...texture is drier and it left my lips drier....I vote for the CLASSIC...it is a 5!
1,Horrible,"Thought it was too good to be true and it was. The artificial sweetener taste is so sweet and it just overwhelms the whole drink. Regular Slim Fast tastes fine to me, but I am trying to go low carb..."
1,Tastes Awful!,"I could not get past the taste on these ones, I literally gagged. It's supper sugary sweet in that unnatural way. I don't know what I am going to do with the other cans & I won't buy this product again. I don't think it's the flavor because I like the Creamy Chocolate flavor in the SlimFast Optima cans."
4,A text commonly quoted in modern texts,This text is old-english style. It is commonly feferenced in modern texts. it makes a good comparison between modern techniques and their development...some exposures have remained unchanged for 50yrs.Many of the descriptions are unique; like the description of how to find the radial nerve in the arm around the deltoid insertion.
1,umbrella fan not as described,"The umbrella fan was a great idea. But, when it was slid down the umbrealla pole and the paddles removed, we could not close the umbrella completly and therefore could not cover the umbrella during a rain storm. Had to send it back and it cost twenty-some dollars to do so.!!"
4,The spirit of Glenn Miller lives on,"After the Air Force plane carrying big band legend Glenn Miller was lost over the English Channel, leadership of his crackerjack dance band fell on the shoulders of saxophonist Tex Beneke, who kept the organization humming at a fast clip for many years afterwards. These postwar radio transcription recordings show Beneke keeping the Miller tradition very much alive, with smooth, formidable and familiar charts, as well as a few new, modern touches that showed the band was more than just a museum piece. A nice 2-CD set that Miller (and Beneke!) fans will definitely want to check out."
5,Excellent compilation of information,"This is the most comprehensive volume of information I have found on manuals for the Corps. Most of the information on the CD is useful regardless of if you are a Marine or not. It contains 23 full manuals. They all appear to be the most current versions. A couple of the manuals are grainy (from older manuals), but all are perfectly readable. I would not hesitate to buy this CD again-I wish I had years ago."
5,The Sock For the True Sock Puppeteer,"I found these socks to be really comfortable on my hands. As a sock puppeteer it's difficult to find a pair of socks that are comfortable and don't chaff. These socks are perfect. They keep my hands cool during the puppet performances I give. They material is easy to write on using a sharpie. Craft glue sticks to it rather well, too. Most sock puppeteers prefer crew socks for their puppets. I like using over-the-calf socks because it allows me to not only make a puppet face, but an entire puppet costume for the rest of the body. These are the type of socks for the true sock puppeteer."
1,review jobst compression socks,"Item was still to small for customer..could not get it over the foot!Received the product in a very timely fashion, just not large enough for feet."
3,JOBST SOCKS - WRONG COLOR,"I ordered two pairs of Jobst Socks as stocking stuffers for Christmas. I paid $15 a pair, plus $10 for expedited Christmas delivery. When they arrived, one pair came was the wrong color. I ordered black and navy and got navy and the brightest WHITE you've ever seen. Now I have to figure out how to send them back, and there were no instructions inside the box....... not very convenient...."
3,"they were not fitting the same as the ones we purchased in a medical suppy store., they were to tight. Wanted to return them","Quality good just to tight, these are the same as we puchased in store but your product was just to tight."
5,Diabetic socks,Very good socks.....had to cut out toes because of sweating of toe areas......still worked for support of veins in legs......
3,Not bad,"The stockings are effective though hard to get on if your as overweight as I am. Once you get them on they were comfortable for about six to eight hours, then they seriously started to hurt abd I had to take them off."
2,Good information but too Microsoft-centric,"I really like the content in this book, especially the basics that it covers. I've never really understood some of the intricacies of PayPal, and I do need to know about it, so that's good. Unlike most O'Reilly books which have the opportunity to be somewhat language-neutral, however, this one fails at that important aspect. Many similar books from O'Reilly attempt to give examples in several languages, for instance, Perl, PHP, Python, Visual Basic, Java, etc. But this book only offers its wealth of examples in ASP.NET. Which is such a shame. Shame on you O'Reilly! It could have been so useful!!!"
4,Very helpful,"Like all the ""Hacks"" books from O'Reilly, this one is quite solid. There's plenty of info about the things you know about but don't quite understand, as well as things you didn't know anything about.Of course, it runs into the problem that any book of this nature runs into - which coding language to use for the examples. Personally, I'd like to see a bit less code and a bit more high level discussion about the concept of what the code should be doing (and thus be able to easily translate into any programming language).But overall, this is a solid buy."
2,not expected,"This product lays more at an angle than described, I thought it was more upright. Not sure if that is why when placing the bottles on the tray, they sit too close together where it's hard to see."
2,Overpriced Shipping and Handling,"Okay product. Not worth the $9 shipping and handling judging by the material of the item and packaging."""
1,I'm simply astounded,"I read this book because it was required in one of my classes since they wanted to give us something kind of light and fluffy to read. This book was not light and fluffy. It makes me cringe with how Blister conducts herself, and since I, a mere 15 year old, can't stand the attitude the main chacter puts out because it is so flat out rude and disrepectful I don't think anyone else could be able to stand it. This book is shallow to a new extreme. the chacters seem so one dimensional to me it makes me want to cry. I love books ,and I love reading and I think this book would have been a whole lot better if the author would have put some meat on the proverbial bones of this story so it didn't read like soda that's been left out: flat, stale, and leaves a bad foul taste in your mouth.Needless to say, I don't reccomend this book to anyone who would like something more than a shallow whiny preteen who thinks she has it bad."
2,"A Big, Fat, Red Blister","This book, is ok, I guess. I love my school library, and I was just browsing and picked it up and started reading. I was in 6th grade, then, and now I am in 8th. I used to think that that was the coolest book ever. Now that I read it again, I think it is a lot less. This book entertained me greatly. I could relate to her struggles to fit in. But i think that this book sends a good message to young girls (i.e. Self-Esteem, confidence) but also, not good ones (i.e. Lying, stealing, changing to fit in). So I think that people should read it and choose their opinion. Good morale? Bad morale? You choose :)"
5,excelent product,i have allways like the smell of gyvenchy hot and i will all ways like it. this shower gel is special for weekends
4,Labello lip balm,"I bought this years ago overseas, but it doesnt seem to be as good as it used to be. However, its still better than any of our domestic lip balms that I have tried, and I have tried a bunch."
5,The Best Lipbalm Ever!!,"I recently purchased this lipbalm while vacationing in Europe, and now I'm hooked! It's the best lipbalm I've ever tried! It lasts for hours, is very moisturizing, and does not leave a waxy feel! I am definitely now a LaBello user for life!"
5,Amazing!,"My sister let me borrow some of her Labello when we were in Dubai and as soon as I got home, I bought a couple sticks for myself. It's very soft unlike Chapstick which is great when your lips are extremely dry and I love the scent. It's very subtle and just smells like lip balm should - no flowers, no perfumes, just balm."
5,A great...absolutely amazing soundtrack,The original motion picture soundtrack to the movie Stargate is fabulous. I am a big fan of Stargate and the music by David Arnold is quite breathtaking and enjoyable to watch. The CD from the very first opening song to the last song is stunning. The music comes from the movie and highlights the plot and cast reactions.A great soundtrack for a wonderfully made movie. I suggest any fan of the movie or corresponding series get this CD for you won't be disapointed
5,Classic Score!,"Arnold really proved his worth with this score. He is one of those amazing composers that rose to incredible heights in an extremely short amount of time. Good grief, his new Bond scores are fantastic! But back to this score. Much of this soundtrack reminds me of what many score lovers would call ""the good old days."" Defined by prominent themes, melodic romance, blazing action, and horrific suspense, Stargate reminds one of ""Star Wars"" or ""E.T"" with a bit of ""The Mummy"" thrown in for good measure.If you are a fan of Arnold, film scores or the film, you can't go wrong buying this masterpiece."
2,Very disappointed: product deteriorated quickly and no tech support from Oregon Scientific,"For the first few months I had this mp3 player I loved it. It's lightweight and was great for swimming laps. Within five months, however, the sound quality deteriorated markedly (treble faded in and out) and now, at 7 months, the player will only work if I hold it face upwards and stand still(think of the way you hold an egg in the palm of your hand). Forget about swimming with it, walking the dog, or any of the other forms of exercise that you might want it for. Hitting the reset button solves the problem for about 10 minutes . . .Although tech support at the Oregon Scientific website promises a response within 48 hours, I have never received one. All in all, I would not purchase anything from this company."
1,EXPENSIVE JUNK!,"Wow, was I fooled. I purchased this to swim with. The pedometer button on top stuck within 3 weeks and would only unstick here and there. It was also difficult to see in moderate or bright light, and it would only recharge while the computer is active (stops charging when computer hibernates.) So if you want to charge for 2 hours, you have to be on the computer for that time...stupid. Do what I did...buy a 4GB iPod Nano for the gym and hum to yourself while you swim. (Rhyme is unintentional)"
3,Pretty good but too expensive,"Prompt shipping. But at $20 a jar? Are you kidding me? I used to buy multiple jars to reduce overall shipping cost, but they have changed the product listing by raising the price to include the cost of shipping now. Ridiculous. This stuff makes a pretty good pie, but not worth it. I tried the Amish brand to save money, but all it is is colored corn starch. I threw the other jars away. Yuk. Barry Farms is still the better of the 2 product choices on Amazon. If you want a $20 too-sweet, mediocre pie. I wish I didn't love hard-to-get black raspberries so much."
3,"Lanyard is Clunky, Weighs Down Neck","I like this lanyard well enough, but if I had it to do over again, I would go for something lighter and more flexible. Also for the record, the promotional materials say that this is a call lanyard ""with black mini duck ornament."" But it is not a mini duck ornament. It is a mini duck call ornament, which is a far different thing. Still, it seems silly to split hairs over lanyards. This one is functional, but so is a length of parachute cord. I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend."
3,Lanyard serves the purpose,"As an avid hunter and being a female, I appreciated the overall quality of the paracord lanyard. Its finish work was superb and unlike others, does not tend to weigh you down with useless cord weaving. It is sufficient, lightweight and just right for a woman. I could say more, but why ramble?"
4,Lanyard Review,"Picture here and Hunter's Specialties website show the lanyard as round braid, not zippered as it is. Everything else is correct. Would rather have round braid but the zippered braid is fine. The lanyard is bigger around than looks in the picture, but nothing a knot tied in the back won't fix. I like everything else about the lanyard. Would definately recommend it. Holds calls well and looks great."
1,Gloria Gooney Bird,"Product did not match photo. Did not have heart shaped bamboo. Instead it had round shape bamboo, same as Gilbert the Gooney Bird. I already had that one and was hoping to get the one that was pictured...."
4,A dream come true...,"This novel is no less than an evolution of the ""novel form"". There is not one word on the page that is superfluous. Ms Allen's <The Dreaming Girl> is concise; deeply provocative, probing and highly satisfying. This novel explores and transgresses the boundaries between lust and love, the body and memory, fantasy and reality. A girl of twenty-one meets a German man while traveling in Belize. Together and apart, their bodies, minds, and memories confront the jungle of life that surrounds them. Ms Allen's narrative is deeply hypnotic; this is a journey that as a reader you will not forget."
3,FYI: Half Oldies/Half Soundtrack,"The first 8 songs of the disk could be your intro to the Memphis sound but it is likely that you can find these songs packaged elsewhere with more Rockabilly, Blues and Soul goodness (I especially suggest you seek out more Bobby Blue Bland!). Songs 9-16 are from the soundtrack that are great within the film but might not work for all just as a listen in album form as they share the same musicial themes/may seem repetitive. Regardless, I find them enjoyable and they are the main reason I've given the disk three stars (I have the other songs elsewhere). These soundtrack songs are all penned by Johh Lurie and include guitarist Marc Ribot (seeY Los Cubanos Postizos) who I know through Tom Waits (no surprise as (both) have appeared on other Jarmish soundtracks (e.gNight On Earth: Original Soundtrack Recording)). Just didn't want anyone to be surprised."
5,The Amazon Synopsis is for a different Wilhelm novel!,"Wilhelm's unique ability to speak from her character's minds has never been more striking than in this tense story which sweeps from a university campus in the rockies to the woods of oregon. This is a haunting story, chock full of complex, interesting characters carried along in a gripping plot. Buy this book! It will be reread.."
3,Confusing and depressing,"I feel compelled to be the first to enter a negative review for this book. I generally like books that invite the reader to learn more about a related or tangential subject, but I found the descriptions of the Mandelbrot images extremely difficult to fathom. It left me feeling like an outsider and rather skeptical of the effects attributed to the images. And while I am often pleased and excited by surprise endings or ""twists"", I found this one (don't want to give anything away) very distressing. I do have to give it 3 stars for an engaging plot and great human interest, but a lot of it left me cold, or chilled."
3,Mystery About Mathematics,"This is a mystery novel about mathematics and the Mandelbrot set and new realities. It has good courtroom scenes but is ultimately unrewarding. The novel cops out at the end as though the author did not know where to go. In this sense, it is similar toThe Firm- - it never pans out with its promises."
1,Disappointment Qualified,"After reading this book (certainly not a story), I am now disappointed qualified. This book was difficult to follow, went all over the place and had the worst ending I've ever endured."
2,Glad it's ended!,"This book was just all over the place. The core story was engaging, but then the author decided it was necessary to take the reader off on confusing, unnecessary, ridiculous, and frankly, unbelievable side-plots. Why?! After dragging the reader through endless chapters of what I can only describe as a farce, she left off with an ending that was abrupt and dissatisfying! Very disappointing read."
2,Slow,"It took me forever to read this book. Usually I finish a good mystery in a couple of days. The book never engaged me,so when I finally learned ""who did it"", I just didn't care."
3,"good characters, weak resolution","the book was very well written and interesting as it went along, but the end was very disappointing. I don't want to give it away, but it was hard to believe."
1,Don't waste your time,"The solution to the mystery was flawed--motivation just didn't ring true. Plus, the whole philosophy of the main character--that everyone uses everyone else for their own gain and the innocent and good are the first to be mowed down--is such a downer. I expected Barbara (the main character) to come to the realization that life is better than that. Instead, the book was contrived to prove her point."
2,Tedious Read,"The author, in her attempt to provide evocative and thought-provoking perceptions of the Chaos theory, supplies the reader instead with a tedious and hard-to-follow story. The characters are stilted, and Barbara Holloway's sudden and intense affair with a mathematics professor is frankly unbelievable. It casts the lawyer into the role of a teenager with a crush. Also, it appears that Wilhelm loathes descriptive narrative of her characters; a concise description of Holloway is not given in any of the Holloway books. Being unable to bond with the characters creates a lackluster and confusing tale."
2,"Like Harper's mother, Mrs Sloane, I too, am without awe.",This movie is the male-fantasy of every photographer who has ever picked up a camera in hopes of bedding a bevy of pretty girls.
2,Sarah Polley Bringing Down her Career,"Crappy film posing as art. Older man, younger woman. Why does she want him? B/c he manipulates her constantly by promising to teach her the art of photography that throughout most of the movie she has no interest in learning. He calls her Guinevere, as he calls all his ""pupils"". She continues to let him call her that even when learning of all his other ""pupils"". Realistic in the way that the only way an older man could get a young girl to satisfy him and support his unemployment is through intense, cruel manipulation of a hopeless wanderer with the self-esteem of a gnat. The end was not realistic in the slightest. Loved Sarah Polley in ""My Life without Me"" but she did her career injustice by doing this film. And her grill looks so messed up."
2,"eh.. checks count, but inaccurate","If you are looking for count, i guess this works. However, you are better off doing the exact same thing, but for a DR. So you can get full reads (movement, etc).For instance, this said i have high count, but it took us a while to conceive. I am guessing motility was a factor (we used preseed lube, got preg next try)."
4,Useful Screening Tool,"This product was helpful when used as a screening tool, just to be sure things are working ok and to send you in the right direction if they are not."
4,Living in Canada,"The test came only 2 days after the date that they told me and i live in Canada, that is pretty good."
5,True Story,"The true story of a cop who knew too much.1978 hardcover. 311 page published by Houghton Mifflin Company.Author's note: All of the events depicted in this book are a matter of factual record, and the people are real. No names have been chenged. The dialogue has either been taken from concealed tape recordings made at the time the events took place or been carefully reconstructed through interviews with the participants."
2,Not Enough Original Thought; Too Much Name-Dropping,"I've always loved the fact that long-distance sports such as running and cycling have rhythms to them which allow the athlete to take a metaphysical journey along with the physical one. I liked Sheehan's articles in ""Runner's World"" years ago, and I liked his book ""Running to Win"".This one simply isn't as good. For whatever reason, Sheehan seemed bent on naming as many other thinkers as he could, without appearing to really assimilate much.If you have never read any philosophy yourself, you may find some value in this book; but if you've studied philosophy at all, I'd recommend you skip it."
2,Coulter Historical Romantic Fiction,"If I like the way an author writes, I give that author's genres, other than mystery, a chance. These stories have become boring. I am going back to her FBI and crime fiction. Her plots are still fine there."
4,"This is a fast paced, intriguing romance.","I found this book very enjoyable, with one exception. Though there were many entralling incidents, none of them went into great detail. This was a little bit of a disappointment, coming from such a wonderful writer. This book is perfect for a rainy afternoon. You won't put it down. I know I didn't. Please consider reading more books by Catherine Coulter"
4,ONE OF THE BEST,THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOK THAT COULTER HAD WRITTEN. HAVING THE DAUGHTER OF THE DEVIL GET ALL CAUGTH UP IN HIS WEB FROM THE DEVIL'S EMBRACE. THIS BOOK OF MANY BETRAIL AND HATRED. THE STORY CONTAIN TWO LOVE STORY IN ONE. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS WAS THE ONE OF BOOK THAT EVER GOT ME MOVING. I COULDN'T PUT THIS DOWN.I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE TO READ THIS BOOK. I RATE IT UP THERE WITH THE HELLION BRIDE. THE STORY HAS IT OWN TWIST AND TURNS AND I FEEL IT WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK TO SNUG UP BY THE FIRE AND READ. THE STORY ITSELF WAS QUITE MOVING FOR ME. I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD PICK UP A CATHERINE COULTER BOOK AND READ.
2,I really wanted to like it,"I read Oxygen and then The Fifth Man. I really wanted to like these books, but I found the characters to be very frustrating...all of them. I could write on and on about the issues I have, but the short version is simply to say that I felt I was reading about people with the maturity level of 11th graders. So, if you are in high school, I highly recommend these books as you will be able to relate to all the hormones and angst."
5,Loved it - a real page turner!,"This book was great. Very well written. These fine men did an excellent job with this story. Great mystery, romance and suspense."
4,Lots Of Fun! Good Sequel to Oxygen,"Although not quite the caliber of ""Oxygen"" this book is enjoyable and still contains that edge-of-your-seat story telling style. Again there's not much in the way of ""Christian"" fiction but it does ask some good questions and it clearly shows the effects of lying even if your intentions are honorable. I could have done without some of the romance but then again it does add to the character development. I thought ""The Fifth Man"" was a good title and not misleading at all. The story sort of leaves room for another sequel but I don't think it's necessary and I wouldn't want to see the characters undergo anymore hardship. I think they've been through enough.1 Star = I've been robbed!2 Stars = Why'd I finish it?3 Stars = Good4 Stars = Excellent5 Stars = Life changing"
1,Bug in the IRA/Pensions withdraw Area:,"If you take IRA withdraws and have a pension just stay away from this program. If you already have it and can't get hold of tech support, email me and I'll tell you the work around they came up with. The sad thing is we could not have been the first to encounter this, (the tech people acted like it), so who knows how many retired people overpaid."
3,No one likes to do taxes,I have read the reviews on all the Tax software. All I can say is that no one seem to have anything nice to say about any of them. I think that people are so upset when there doing there taxes that they cant say anything good about anything. I have always used Turbo tax but was thinking about switching to tax cut. I just dont think that its going to make it more easier.
1,"No support, $10 to speak to rep","Sirs, I bought TaxCut Standard on January 17 and found that it does not allow me to progress past ""do you want to download updates now?"" (That is bad because the existing software is said to be of November vintage.) When I try to download I am told that I do not have an internet connection. (I did.) So I took the software back and asked for a refund. BestBuy agreed that the software is useless as is. [...]No value to me. No software update. No refund. BestBuy (Atlanta, Perimeter Center) agreed that to continue to sell that product would only harm the good reputation of BestBuy.One star seems generous to me.CECoffey"
2,Does NOT fit on my Mossberg 500,"The rear trigger pin fits perfectly but the two front holes in the mount itself are useless. Only one hole lines up with anything (the ejector screw), and this cannot be removed or the ejector mechanism will fail. I even contacted Mossberg and they said that the product is faulty and shouldn't be used without smithing.Further more, if you do feel like using the ejector screw port for the front of the mount, the more you tighten the screw the further in it pulls the mount - COMPLETELY misaligning the mount as a suitable point for any kind of optic.Plain and simple, this mount doesn't work without proper gun smithing. I am now using a zip-tie to hold down the front of the mount until I have it properly smithed. I don't give many bad reviews on Amazon, but this is one of them..."
1,Saddle Mount,This Item is terriable for a 12 guage it lasted about a week then the screw popped the threads out can't even use it now
1,Missing parts,I wanted this to mount my scope but when it came a screw and nut was missing I had to improvise and that sucks
3,stolen wrench,The small bag where the wrench should have been didn't. A hole was made in it where someone pushed the wrench out to take it. The fit of the saddle mount is good but I though it was a bit too high in cost. I've heard other people who said Amazon has been raising prices.
4,It's nice once you get it on there.,This mount is good once you get it on there. It scratched my gun's finish a bit trying to get it lined up properly. The mounting hardware leaves a bit to be desired. The tiny screws don't match the bore of my Mossberg 500 & just penetrate into the mount.Once it's mounted though it's nice to use. The peep through makes it easy to roughly adjust your sights on the fly or just use your iron sights. I was able to mount & accurately use a reflex sight in a few minutes.
3,Dylanesque,"This is a pleasant enough effort by perennial Seattle folkie and old-school activist Jim Page, accompanied by Billy Oskay and Mark Ettinger. It's aimed at those who like their politics progressive and their granola crunchy. The album's title is an obvious reference to Bob Dylan, whose early songwriting and voice Page often attempts to emulate. Its centerpiece is the rather self-congratulatory anthem ""Didn't We,"" which is about the 1999 WTO protests. More of Page's albums are available at jimpage.net."
1,An absolute waste of money- don't buy this book,"I bought this book in order to gain some insight and information on how to battle the disease of compulsive gambling.What I got was anything but that. This book is poorly written, poorly constructed, appears to contain NO valid or clinically researched /proven information of any kind, and is more of some random person's person experience and OPINION about gambling. This didn't help me AT ALL, and I would NOT recommend you purchase this book."
2,A Way to Quit Gambling?,"The reader of this book would be better served by going straight to the back of the book and contact the organizations listed in the appendix such as GA or the National Council on Problem Gamblers. There is nothing in this book that would benefit the compulsive gambler and help him/her stop gambling. It is poorly written. There are numerous points throughout which take up page space. Example from Page 44: ""Consider the benefits of not gambling. You will not be able to lose. By not losing, your finances will improve in disbelief. Also, emotional turmoil and stress associated with gambling will vanish."" There are other equally simplistic points throughout. I found this book of little or no benefit."
1,Should be R,"The film is extremely innapropriate for minors. The constant sex himts, an old woman asking two boys to come help her ""make a sandwich"", a leasbian constantly chasing a girl, and several other putrid things made my rating of this go down."
5,amazing concert & DVD,"This concert DVD is simply amazing. I would recommend buying it for the sound alone - recorded in 5.1 at Wembley stadium for someone who is known for producing, so you know it will be good. The surround sound on the Art Of Noise track is incredible. Wonderful artist lineup, I just let this DVD run in the background sometimes when I'm doing stuff around the house.Consider buying it from your local PBS station as some of them have offered it in the past (KCET in Los Angeles for example)during their pledge drive."
5,"Triple Play-a great book for me, my team and my boss.","I checked out the website for this book and see it's a finalist for FAST COMPANY magazine's March 2004 book of the month. No surprise here! The authors ask tough questions that made me do some thinking, especially about my reputation. I realize when it comes to figuring out how other people might see me-in some areas, (I admit it)-I don't have a clue. The book doesn't leave you hanging. The stories are interesting, fresh and the authors give real world advice, not pie-in-the-sky stuff. Plus the research statistics are hard hitting! Ouch!But the best thing about the book for me? It made me want to get better as a manager and co-worker. Thanks for that."
5,Very good overview of the diferent stages of Awakening,This book help me to understand the many phases of Awakening we go through as we go inward to find and be our self's... As a student of the B.O.T.A. school it gave me another point of view of the many things I have learned over the years with B.O.T.A. and gave me new understanding of what to do to finish one of my stages of awakening in this life....
3,American Cheese?,"I remembered catching a few episodes of this series from the 90s, and decided to buy the complete series. It's fairly campy, but entertaining if you go into it with that in mind. The kid is adorable, and sometimes I think his accent is steals the show."
2,Element Missing,"I watched the early episodes of ""American Gothic"" when they first aired, mainly because I liked star Gary Cole's work on the unappreciated ""Midnight Caller.""He's great, and the stories were eerie and creepy, but I felt the show lacked suspense. To me, it needed a strong character to oppose Cole's Satanic sheriff. Watching him get his way each week got boring and predictable with no one trying to thwart him.I eventually stopped watching the series after about a dozen episodes because of this."
5,excellent series,"enjoyed this series when it first came on television, but, if I remember correctly, the series was 'pulled' from local television before the series completed. Now I can enjoy the series all over again AND see the ending!"
5,How did I live through the 90s and miss this gothic family cult classic?,"This series is addicting; only start watching it if you have LOTS of time on your hands because you won't be able to stop. I started watching it because I am a big fan of American Horror Story and I found this while Wikipedia-ing one day. Sarah Paulson is just as great in American Gothic as she is in Season 2 of American Horror story. The plot is exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The main character, Lucas Black, who stares at the child Caleb, is a well developed character and gives an extremely convincing performance.For those who are a big fan of V C Andrews, this plot line has a lot of the same themes as her novels. Family betrayal, deception, fear, and of course, a bad guy you love to hate. Highly highly recommend!"
5,There's Someone on DVD..Finally!!!,"I am soooo excited to see that this series has finally has made it to DVD. I enjoyed every minute of each episode, and was disheartened when the network didn't continue the series. Gary Cole is at his best as the sexy (somewhat evil) Lucus Buck, and the rest of the cast is perfect. Finally, a trip back to Trinity, where the storylines are excellent, and nobody is what they seem to be. Thank you, Thank you!!!!"
1,"Great series, but the 3 DVD Universal Release is FUBAR","The 3 double-sided disc series is out of order and on awful DVD-18s, which are more subject to damage and failure. Oddly though, NETFLIX is renting a 6 disc set of single-sided discs (DVD-9s), but these are NOT available for purchase from NETFLIX as previously viewed, or new anywhere else. Figures!My 1-star rating is for the FUBAR Universal release. I rate the show itself as 4 stars.Why is it soooo hard for studios to do it right? Paramount screwed up ""Keen Eddie"" (muddy, generic replacement music, and 1-2-9-12-6-10-7-11-8-5-4-3-13 FUBAR airing order). Warner Home Video screwed up Crusade (FUBAR TNT airing order). Universal screws up American Gothic. ARGH!!! This stuff must be rocket science, or monkeys are in charge of putting these releases together."
3,Not as good as I remember and ...,"The plots frequently fall into a victim-of-the-week rut, with someone new, about whom you don't really care, falling victim to Sheriff Buck's machinations. Gary Cole can't quite carry the load he has been given, and supporting roles are given less time because the latest victim must be introduced. The best 11 episodes make for a solid viewing experience, while the remainder seem like bland filler. And the picture frequently appears grainy."
3,American Gothic,I have only seen 2 episodes I admit most series take a min to pull you in so far just not a have to watch thing more out of something to do this guy playin the sheriff just really isn't doin it for me
1,American Gothic poor quality,"I'd been looking forward to this release, and upon first viewing, this pristine, brand new set seemed like a heavily rented used series.Instead of good quality DVDs, these are double sided and there were scratches and glitches throughout the 2 1/2 discs I tried to watch. It actually froze on one disc and had to be continually re-started.How Universal could have done such an inept job is beyond me. There was a ready and waiting audience for this series.Maybe if there are enough complaints, they'll re-release it.We can only hope!"
4,The Best Show Ever,"Ever since the show went off the air in the summer of 96,ive been waiting for this DVD. Its been a LONG 10 year wait but well worth it since the Sci-Fi channel dumped the series.American Gothic is by far the best TV series i have ever seen and i cherish all 22 shows-Gary Cole is breathtaking as Lucas Buck (Thats Buck with a B)and Lucas Black always chokes me up as a boy struggling to come to terms as his sister Merlyn is murdered.Paige Turco is very sexy as well as Brenda Bakke,both fine actresses.I would have given this 5 stars but like many others have said the episode order is painfully out of whack."
3,DVD episodes out of order!,"This was one of the most frightening shows ever created for television. However, while I would like to share it with some friends I'll have to warn them to not watch the series in the order on the box because the episodes are out of order which would only confuse them. I'm considering writing to Universal and complaining about this fact."
5,Totally Awesome Series and the DVDs work perfectly,"I may be one of the lucky few but my dvds are working perfectly. No skipping or freezing. The color is crisp. Picture sharp. The sound is exceptional. Never realized how good and effective the sound track is in this series. The series is a lot better than I remember it. Gary Cole, Lucas Black, and the rest of the cast do a great job creating an atmosphere, sense of mystery, and feeling of suspense rarely seen on TV. All of the episodes are excellent and the writing is superb. Very happy it came out on dvd. Very happy they did not make more episodes. The ones made were perfect. It is a rare gem that might have been ruined if it went into another season and the writing quality deteriorated."
4,Great fun!!,"Enjoying this very much!! This is a wonderful, fun set to watch. I am enjoying introducing my husband to this series."
5,One of my favorite series!,"When I watched the first episode on the Chiller channel, I quickly lost interest. Luckily, my son enjoyed it and kept watching it; I would watch it with him and try to figure out just why he liked it so much. It wasn't long before I started watching it because *I* enjoyed it, and I became addicted to the series.The only thing I didn't like about it was the last episode. The plot seemed rushed (and the end scene, with the battle between Caleb and Sheriff Buck seemed a bit hokey). As others have pointed out, this was because the show was canceled, and the writers needed to quickly tie up the loose ends. Even with the hokey ending, I still enjoy watching the American Gothic episodes over and over again."
5,American Gothic,"I dont care that they recorded on both sides. I am just so happy its finally on DVD. Played fine, no problems. Loved it, all of it. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Be sure to watch them in order per another review for the perfect viewing experience."
5,American Gothic-the Best Show!!!,"What makes this show so good is the acting skills of Gary Cole. He portrays the character of Sheriff Buck so well, that you have to ask yourself...Is he really as bad as he seems, or is there a good side to him!I'm just sorry the show was canceled on the first season. I would have loved to see the story line progress....Oh well!!!"
2,Don't Bother -- There Must be Something Better than this on Amazon,"I was looking for some music that suggested Easter Island, but this is generally too weird. (The movie is also historically distorted, so the music supports that -- think psycho.)"
4,The Very Best of Sting & the Polce,"Unlike many artists this very best of album has some of the really best songs from Sting and the boys. Actually my copy of this includes three other songs which include: Seven Days, Fragile and De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da (I live in Australia so it may have been the local pressing). Whether you like the ""Best of"" albums or not, this CD is well made and touches on all of the best songs around during the 70's and 80's."
4,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,GREAT PRODUCT FOR HAIR THAT IS VERY DRY. WORKS BETTER WHEN HAIR IS WET. IF YOU HAVE CURLY HAIR IT WILL STRAIGHTEN YOUR CURLS OUT.
1,Scalp breaks out,Grooms hair well and leaves it soft but my scalp breaks out. I should note that I have very sensitive skin and have to be VERY careful what I put on my hair.
5,A hard to find product,I have used this product for years and it is no longer available in local drugstores. So happy to find a source for an old standby.
5,Great Stuff - Be sure you order the right version,"I've been using Wildroot Hair Groom for over 50 years and it has always been the same great product. Not too thick, non-greasy, without alcohol, and easily absorbed into my hair(no too much left anymore though). I use it after throughly wetting my hair. It's a five star product.FYI, I just received a newly ordered bottle of ""Original Wildroot."" BEWARE - Evidently it's not the same product as this one, ""Wildroot Original The Natural Looking Hair Groom."" It is much thicker, does not spread as easily, and the scent is different. It's easy to make the mistake as the packaging is identical. However the names and UPC codes are different. I would give the ""Original Wildroot,"" which is decidely NOT the original formula, only two or three stars. Be careful as you shop around."
4,how-to achieve kindness,"THE HIDDEN POWER OF KINDNESS is something of a spiritual how-to guide for achieving kindness. The nature of the book can be discerned from the full title (...A Practical Handbook for Souls Who Dare to Transform the World, One Deed at a Time). It was for me more of a self-help spiritual guide than a testimony of the power of kindness.Mr. Lovaski's approach in this book is quite spiritual and religious in making the case for transformation through kindness. For a more historical (less of a self-help) proof of the power of kindness, you may want to read THE SEEDS WE SOW, KINDNESS THAT FED A HUNGRY WORLD.The Seeds We Sow, Kindness That Fed A Hungry World"
5,The Coal King's Slaves,"Wow, I loved it. What a story. My grandfathers worked in mines. It gave me a great insight to their struggles. The stories they told me in my child hood were explained in detail. I am not much of a book reader, but I could not put this book down. Gripping. All persons who work for a living should read this book. See what these people did to pave the way for all of us. Be thankful and don't let their stuggles go for not in this era of corperate greed. A must read for all union members."
1,Lacked impetus,"The story began promisingly enough, but was quickly bogged down by pages of historical information spouted by the main characters via completely unbelievable speechifying, or was worked into the text through the device of a character's reading. This had the effect of bringing what little action there was to a grinding halt.Much of the information was only tangentially relevant to the story; for example, the main character sits his young protege down and tells him all about the Molly Maguires - thirteen pages of infodump. Mr. Williams should have written an anecdotal history of coal mining and not bothered with writing a novel."
5,Life and Death in a Nineteenth Century Coal Mine,"The Coal King's Slaves provides an excellent overview of the everyday trials and tribulations of a Welsh mining family in the Anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The five members of the family are presented in a believable manner, and help to illustrate the dangers faced by underground miners. The tragedies presented in the loss of one son's hand in a mining accident and the death of another son illustrate the every day conditions faced in these under regulated mines. The concerns of the parents reminded me of my mother's narration of the death of her oldest brother in a mining accident shortly after his return from World War I.The book is an excellent read for anyone interested in pick and shovel coal mining in the United States. The book also offers insights into the hostility between ethnic groups in nineteenth century America."
3,Generation X ups and downs,"This Live album features two different concerts at two different periods in time.The first part-1978-is the true punk Generation x years on stage.A blasting performance, raw and ugly as it should be!Pure energy with a great sound.The second part-1981-is the beginning of the end, starting with the hit Dancin' with myself and goin' on with semi pop-punk uninspired songs.The sound is also very good but the performance is quite boring and the audience is pretty quiet too.An interesting cover of Bowie's Andy Warhol.A good cd on the whole thanx to the powerful first concert and the sound."
2,Not much useful information here.,Author spends too much time psycohoanalyzing the details of causitive factors from an unhealthy childhood (more than half the tape)and not enough time giving any useful information on what the adult can do to improve their self-discipline. He could easily turn someone off with his very spiritual and psychoanalytical way of speaking.I found his style a little too flowery to hold my attention. Bottom line is that I found very little helpful information on this tape.
3,"To Be completely honest,","I feel this album could of been a lot more like the movie than anything,the ending song in the movie sung by a female is sung by a male on the cd,and that was the reason I bought the darn thing,the rest is ok,I love industrial and trance and this just isn't real pleasing to my ears."
4,Inspiring as Poetry,"To begin with : I am not into this, I don't belong to this world. I just started getting into mathematics. However I can say that this book gives a very good account of history on one of the most diffcult mathematical problem and leaves you all inspired for the effort & ingenuity of the men and women in history who attempted to solve this...and also who actually made it. Very good indeed..."
4,Rekindling your interest in Mathematical proofing,"This is a highly intellectual piece of work in which any layman who has lost touched with high school Mathematics would not find it difficult to comprehend.It is quite fascinating to read some interesting stories of other mathematicians who are directly and indirectly involved in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. Simon Singh's insights and ability to relate Mathematics from the Ancient Greece to the present day developments have given me a deep appreciation on the evolution of math within a nutshell.Let me assure those who may find it tough to savour the beauty of Mathematics - This book will definitely dispelled such a misgiving. In fact, this book has rekindled my interest in re-examine Mathematics in different light and angle.Go for it. And I bet you will find this book both entertaining and inspiring."
5,Absolutely first rate,"I finished it practically in one sitting because it gave me no choice: it was gripping, informative and offered the best description of how exactly the Taniyama-Shimura conjectures related to the final solution of the problem. It also gave a few simple theorems along the way, theorems whose statement and proof an intelligent layperson can digest, the point of which is to understand what a proof really means in mathematics. In short it incorporates just the right amount of mathematics-- less of it and the book will fail to capture the real issues, more of it, it will needlessly excluded a huge audience that will undoubtedly enjoy reading about the solution of this outstanding problem."
5,Surprisingly fun to read.,"Who would ever have thought that a book on mathematics would include tales of death, murder, duels and suicide? I found the book captivating and fun. I highly recommend it."
2,An Enigma still Not Understood,"I read Singh's FERMAT'S ENIGMA after reading Singh's CODE BOOK. Unfortunately, the latter is by far the better book. Although the CODE BOOK manages to cover both the personal and the quantitative side of the recent revolutions in cryptography, FERMAT'S ENIGMA does not attempt to break into the actual mathematical proofs at all. The result feels like one of those NBC human interest stories that take up airtime from the Olympic Games. The essence is in the math, but we hear instead about the innovators' daily lives."
2,Not informative,"This book presents a lot of facts not related to math, but did not explain well the math used in the original solution, and how different solutions differ."
3,Fermat's Enigma,The book was interesting. I would only recommend it to my Math friends and to the friends i wish to get revenge on. But you really have to have an open heart and mind about before you read it.
4,Intriguing book even for those who aren't math geniuses,I loved this book. I bought it several years ago and have re-read it several times. It reads like a mystery novel. Its a fun and interesting read.
2,A Nobel Failure,"Simon Singh sets out to convey the drama, excitement and genuine suspense surrounding the solving of one of the greatest problems in math - the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Singh's challenge is in both conveying the historical significance of the problem, and in boiling down complex math for those, like me, who are not particularly knowledgeable in math. Sadly, Singh fails in both counts. FERMAT'S ENIGMA moves slowly through the history of number theory, while leaving the meaning math's meaning impregnable. Although this book is short, after a while I was wondering what the use was in going on. I suspect that those who know more about math than I could enjoy this book. Sadly, I could not - it was just over my head."
2,"Too much math, not enough personality.","The book reviews the mathematics associated with Fermats Enigma, but did not tell nearly enough about the mathematicians particularly Andrew Wiles and his search to solve the Enigma. At times, I felt as if I were reading a math book, or a somewhat dry book on the history of mathematics."
5,Don't worry about the maths.This is a detective story.,"If you're as bad at maths as I am you probably think this book is not for you. But don't worry about understanding the maths- just sit back and revel in the story. This gripping book tells the tale of how over hundreds of years the world's top mathematicians grappled with the toughest unsolved problem on the planet - and how the mystery was eventually solved. Author Simon Singh is a rarity - a mathetician who really knows how to write. His book is tremendous fun, absorbing, fascinating and compulsive. Leave the pulp fiction on the shelf and pick this one up - no matter how creaky your algebra you'll enjoy it so much you won't want to put it down."
4,This book made me want to know more about math,"This is not a math book, but a book which tells a story about math and mathematicians. It is thought provoking and entertaining. It is written in a clear and concise manner and is not hard to follow. Many of the ideas presented in this book were new to me, since I~{!/~}m not a mathematician, but they made me want to learn more about math.There were some cases where the author didn~{!/~}t explain everything thoroughly. For example, in the 8th appendix about the game theory riddle. It made me feel like I~{!/~}m missing something, probably due to lack of background. But in general, I really enjoyed reading this book, and it made me want to know more, which was probably one of the author~{!/~}s main goals in writing this book."
5,Mathematics and its pristine beauty,"This is a remarkable and engripping account for the search of a proof to a seemingly naive problem that mystified mankind for more than 350 years. I encountered this problem for the first time when I was 15 in a local Math journal in New Delhi, but never paid too much attention to it. It was the early part of the year 1992 and Andrew Wiles' proof was not yet known. But today I dont feel bad unable to solve the problem because the list of people who failed to prove this problem is astonishingly illustrious. The book is an emotional rollercoaster beautifully woven in the fabric of the hardships, frustrations, romance and genius of some of the best brains to ever live on this earth. The character of Andrew Wiles is beautifully portrayed and one cannot but fall in love with this mathematician. All in all, this book is a classic and definitely a must read for everyone, even for a person with no background in Mathematics."
4,"About the people/history, not math!","I found this book to be fascinating. The best part about it, was it is about the history of math, more than about math itself. You don't need to understand any math at all to understand and enjoy this book. It starts out with a brief history of Fermat's equation, then goes back to the Pythagorean times. I learned more about Pythagoras reading this book, than I did in the 16 years of math I took in school! It was fascinating to hear about the times, and how math was viewed as a religion, the pythagoreans were persecuted, etc. It moves slowly up to modern times, explaining various steps to prove/disprove Fermat's last theorem. Finally, it tells the story of Andrew Wiles: his obsession, his discovery, his fall, and his ultimate triumph.This was a great book. Don't let the subject matter fool you. It isn't dense at all; give it a try!"
3,"Perserverence, dread & triumph","This book is a remarkable 350 year chronicle of Mathematic's search for The Solution to Fermat's Last Thereom. The story is rife with brilliance & ego, fortitude & arrogance. Fermat's Enigma is the rare find that makes mathematics a joy to share with all. (Even the math-phobic.)At one point I literally wanted to throttle Fermat for his mind-boggling cockiness, comfort Andrew Wiles for not quite getting it (and hug him when he does finally get it) and to praise the universe for giving us Simon Singh. He eloquently and visually describes what is often perceived as dry, colorless and arcane."
4,Fascinating history of a long unsolved problem.,"I had only heard vague and off-the-cuff mentions of the problem of Fermat's ""enigma"". I very much enjoyed Singh's ""The Code Book"" and it prompted me to give this one a read as well. Again, excellent writing. As a non-mathematician, this book gave me no problems and did not lose me. I found that it was a breeze to read, and the story is fascinating."
5,Really good read!,"I am not a avid reader and I read for an hour 2 or 3 times a week i.e if the book is good and after I started reading this book I just couldn't drop it. In fact I used to look up every evening to the time when I can start reading it from where I left off the previous night.Its a great book if you are interested in history of math/science, the great minds, their lives, their hardships and frustrations back then and current trends. You don't need know a whole lot of math to understand this. If you understand the Pythagoras theorem you are good to go:)"
5,Satisfied Customer,The book I ordered for a Christmas gift was received on time and was in perfect shape.
4,Every mathematics lover should read,"This book is not only an account of the incredible journey to prove Fermat's last theorem, that made generations of mathematicians devote their lives. It is also an interesting story about the evolution of mathematics. At various moments Singh stops talking about the theorem and tells us episodes in history of mathematics and how that affected peoples' lives. That is what makes the book so interesting."
5,Interesting Story About Mathmatics,"Before reading this book, I had never heard of Fermat or his Last Theorem. However, now I have read about the 350 years of history behind his seemingly simple equation that baffled even the best mathmeticians. I really enjoyed this book because not only was it interesting, but I learned a lot about math itself and the people who studied it. I would highly recommend this book."
4,really nice embedded math-history,"The book actually study math-history related to this problem. I found it quite enlightening and educating. It's really good in that matter, and it's an inspiration for math-studies. But as a CS-student, I think he sometimes explained elementary math too much, which made it a bore for 2-3 pages at a time."
4,"Great read, even for non-math types like me","I read Singh's ""The Code Book"" before, actually re-read it, and found him to have a gift for making complicated things easier to grasp. Though I'm not a mathematics enthusiast, I was intrigued by the story line of this book, and since I enjoyed Singh's writing style I decided to give it a try. Having read about the mathematical component of codes and cryptography in ""The Code Book"", I was curious to learn more. It was great, not bogging down in complicated equations, gave me a new appreciation for the world of mathematics, and added a level of ""personality"" to the world of academia. If there can be such a thing as a mathematical ""page turner"", this is it."
3,a good summary that's a little too long,"Its merits: it's a quick read, there are some intriguing anecdotes about number theory (intruiguing for someone like myself who knows little about it), and the biographical information about the mathematicians is interesting. So was was the history of early mathematics. The appendices gave good short explanations.But It's a quick read because there were many spans with little substance. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably, but then the math-related events didn't mean as much."
5,For Anyone Interested in Math History,"A beautifully written book that traces the development of classical number theory in a way that its ""humaness"", if you will, makes clear that even the most abstract of thinkers in this most abstract of all human endeavors, is very human, indeed. Particularly to my liking is the author's covering of the important women in mathematics, especially his excellent coverage of the contributions of French mathematician, Sophie Germain. That she had to work and publish under an assumed masculine name says a lot about the way we were; perhaps the way we still are in some instances. But finally revealing her identity to the great Guass, and receiving his praise for her work is simply delightful to read.I cannot recommend this work too highly. A masterly performance that will reward the reader with at least a small appreciation of the power, the beauty of the human mind."
4,Great game and workout!,"This is my first time ever playing ddr. I have read several reviews on how people got into shape playing this game because it was so much fun and addicting. They were right! The only complaint I have about this bundle pack, when I bought it, the salesperson said it came with the eye toy. I was sooo disapointed to find out it didn't. My sister works in a music store where they sell the bundle pack, and she also thought that it came with the eye toy due to misleading advertising. In the fine print it says sold seperately. The makers of this game need to make it more clear that it does not come in the pack."
3,I would have given 5 stars when I first got it,"Now that I have experienced what this game should have been(extreme2), I just can't play it the same. That and DDR max, max2, extreme 2, and in the groove all have better music."
2,"Okay plot, awful writing","I purchased this book and its sequel at the same time on the strength of the back-cover blurb. I won't ever make that mistake again. The writing is deeply, deeply terrible. The character's actions are completely at odds with the way they are described - the battle-hardened Lukien, whose life is war weeps every time a minor character dies - and we are constantly told, not shown, how we should be perceiving characters. If you have an extremely high tolerance for Terry Goodkind's worst, most pedantic writing you could conceivably enjoy this book. If you're looking for an intricately plotted, well-written work of epic scale to rival George R. R. Martin or Raymond E. Feist...look elsewhere."
4,The Eyes of God by John Marco,"This is one of the best science fiction/ fantsy books I have ever read and in my time here I have read a lot of them. Currently I am in the middle of a series called ""The Wheel of Time"" by Robert Jordan. In the book ""The Eyes of God"" John Marco uses the characters in new exciting twists but don't blink otherwise you might just find certain unherad of twists in the book that you didn't even think of. The book has all of the suspense and the action you could want. Whenever I read the book I imagine that I am absorbed within the characters and doing what they are doing seeing what they are seeing."
3,"Less Pages, and it would have been perfect.","My main complaint with The Eyes of God is that some parts go far too many pages without any action going on. Marco wastes many pages explaining every minute detail in a scene. I often found myself skipping several pages and still be able to know whats going on. Also, it takes a while (part 2 of the book) before the plot to actually come to fruition. Before that, I'm barely connected to any of the characters and hardly feel connected to Lukien, the main protagonist, just because im told to like him. Once part 2 hits the middle though, I'm finally get interested. and it picks up after that, only with the extraneous pages bringing it down. It's not a bad story overall, but it would have been better with less pages and more concise prose."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this book based upon the positive reviews. I am an avid reader and for the first time ever I returned a book based upon poor quality and even worse writing/story development.The main focus of the story revolves around the actions of Cassandra and Lukien, two of the most shallow and selfish characters I've come across. I couldn't find anything redeemable about either. Yet, Akeela, who is quite admirable in the beginning, changes everything (and loses his own sanity) based upon these worthless individuals. Is the message that beauty or physical strength are more important than all other personal traits combined? Frankly, the story made me nauseous.Do yourself a favor- don't waste the money..."
3,A Bit Dissapointing . . .,"I've really enjoyed Marco's other novels, but I really struggled through this one. For starters, the actual storyline line seems forced and doesn't flow very well. For example why was Lukien needed to free Cassandra? Wouldn't it have been simplier without his involvement? And why wouldn't have Akeela just searched Koth for the second Eye? I know Marco gives his explanations, but I found them unconvincing and forced. And regarding the curse of the Eyes of God, maybe I'm missing somthing, but why would they have believed there would have been a curse? People saw the Kadar with the Eye and there wasn't any curse???The reviews for the second book in the series seem better, but I'm not sold on a second read."
2,A grim and meandering tale,"I don't have too much to say about this story. I felt like Marco may have been trying to create some dramatic tension for future books, but what we get here is largely awful people doing awful things and just a lot of misery with no payoff. If you enjoy disappointment, this book is for you."
5,Incredibly awsome book.,"This is one of the best books ever written. It has everything that makes a good story: war, magic, love, betrayel, and incredible places such as Grimhold, a place where people with something wrong with them go and recieve a sort of magic that helps them do things that they would not be able to do normally, like blind can see or the deaf can hear. All in all this is a great book that has plenty of twists and turns that makes the book exciting. I eagerly await The Devils Armor that should be coming out in the begining of November."
3,Okay,"The book could have been a lot better. The first section was entirely to sappy and boring. After that, it got a lot better and more exciting. I almost put the book down for good during the first part, because there was no excitement, and all of it was political. The next two parts were a lot better. I realized that the first part was just setting the stage for the later, and more exciting part of the book. The rest of the series is much better"
3,A decent story - but I was left wanting,"This was a big book - 779 pages. It bordered on becoming a page turner, but never quite grabbed me. I think the problem with the story was that the characters seemed generally one dimensional. I was hoping for some subtlety, but it seemed like each character was driven by one overwhelming trait. The story itself was interesting, but a little cliched with the main character Akeela driven like Captain Ahab. The story is setting up a sequel, and I'll probably pick it up at some time in the future -- but I'm in no hurry to read it."
1,Like Reading a high-school term paper...,"""...must finish reading incredibly boring and predictable paragraph...but characters are soooo annoying and stereotypical...dialogue is a joke...can't...go...on..."" To each his/her own, I guess. But I'm wondering if the rave reviews on here are from people who work for Daw Books. Tie this to a long rope and use it for a boat-anchor. W-A-S-T-E of money."
1,uh.. camelot?,"This isn't long but I had to post this. The first part of hte book is a huge rip off of the Arthurian legend. i felt like i was reading The Once and Future King all over again. Akeela/Arthur, Lukien/Lancelot, Cassandra/Guenevere. Prized knight falls in loves with new king's queen. queen loves him back. blah blah blah. Its slightly different but the characters seem to have no static traits and their actions are totally unpredictable and out of character. its interesting to read about Gilwyn and theres a few good parts but overall its pretty stupid. the only reason im still reading it is because I can't leave a book unfinished. this makes Terry Goodkind look like a good author."
3,"An Interesting Plot, but....","The Eyes of God was definitialy a book with a well-defined plot. However, the dialogue and portrayal of the characters emotions was not emphasized as well as other novels. In short, it was weak. The history within the novel itself was wonderful, and the brotherly friendship between the king and knight warmed the heart, but the thoughts and feelings of each character was lacking in depth. However, the plot does leave you wondering, ""What's going to happen next?"" Though the novel is truly not an award winning book, it is worth giving a chance."
3,Ok.,"This soundtrack is ok though not as good or as fun as the soundtrack for a Very Brady Sequel, some of the songs on this CD are good but some are truly annoying and nerve grating! I like how they included some dialogue from the movie and how they gave them their own seperate track instead of having them flow into the songs which can be annoying if you only want to listen to the song, though I like when movies include dialogue in their soundtracks not all the dialogue included on this are the best from the movie but it's worth having in my CD collection just for the novelty."
3,Casino Craps Review,"This book is fine for the beginning dice roller, but not for those who already have some knowledge about craps. The book has a VERY GOOD discussion of the basic rules of the game, odds and the different payouts. I like the chapters on special allowance for both right and wrong betters. I still use the book to refresh my memory sometimes. Other than that, however, the playing systems are nothing great. Pass or Don't Pass with odds. Nothing new here, but a good book for those just starting out in the game of craps."
5,Easy Reading,"I like this concise, easy-to-follow bbok. It's well-organized so you can skip sections that don't apply to you at your level."
3,Ever felt like you've been cheated?,"I honestly could care less about the sound quality or the lack of continuity of this ""rarities"" release. What is on this CD is well worth hearing and quite funny. That said, this CD is only around 45 minutes long and from the liner notes this CD was cut down from over 3 hours worth of material. I just have a hunch that substantial material was left off this disk for release later down the road. If you buy this CD just know you will not be getting a full 70 minute dose of Bill Hicks. This disc falls under a ""collectors only"" catagory. This disk has a lot of funny little quirks, antedotes, and slight variations of material released before. If you are looking for introduction to Bill Hicks please select another one of his other releases. Try ""Relentless"" or ""Arizona Bay"""
2,A two star Bill Hicks album?,"I never thought I'd give Bill anything else than five stars but I'm going to have to here.Every Bill Hicks article on the market is a work of genius and should be savoured but like the compilation CD ""Philosophy"",this album was devised bymarketing men off to make a quick buck off his death.The routines are spliced together with no continuity,the sound is poor and this means that the gags can't evoke the laughter they should.And it's way too short at 45 minutes.There are some hilarious routines,such as the Australia routine and kids on airplanes but there's nothing as vitrolic or provocative as there is in his other work.Just another reason to listen to Rant In E Minor,Relentless and Arizona Bay over and over again.And it makes you wish Bill was still around to make sense out of all this unsensible [business] that's going on at the moment;Bush,another Gulf War,I'm sure Bill's turning in his graveR.I.P."
1,"Bill Hicks is brilliant, this CD blows","This CD should be called ""Cutting Room Floor"" or ""I'm Dead and Have No Control Over The Release of My Material."" Don't believe the reviews that tell you not to believe the reviews that don't like this CD. Rant in E-Minor, Relentless, Arizona Bay and Dangerous are what you are looking for. This one is a compilation of not very good bits in no particular order. If you are just getting into Bill, this will make you wonder what all the fuss is about, and you won't look further (a big mistake).As for the reviews:* """"LoveLaughterAndTruth"" deserves more respect than it has been granted by some of the other customer reviewers.""No no no...* If anyone calls themselves a true fan, they MUST own all of his albums.Spoken like a collector, not a fan."
3,Great Bill Hicks Comedy but nearly same skits as Flying Saucer CD,"This Album is funny, and im sure i would have loved it more had it not been the same act as the flying saucer tour.. i know this one is older but still very similar material.. If you do not have Flying Saucer Tour this is worth picking up."
3,Adequate collection of rare clips; not for newbie,"The other reviews here are on the money. If you're new to Bill Hicks DON'T get this; buy any of his albums first. I would recommend Reckless as his most immediately accessible, Rant in E Minor as his most vitriolic, and Arizona Bay as his most original. While fans like myself might enjoy hearing some of the previously unheard bits on this CD, the colleciton is too scattered, abrupt, and hosrt to do Bill Hicks justice. Many of these clips here I've heard versions of on bootlegs, and they're much funnier and smarter in context; here, they're often just butchered. This is a collection for completists that won't even satisfy completists."
3,Picture was white; Got grey,What I wanted was a bucket with a lid. I wanted it in white so that it would blend in with its surroundings. Got grey which messed up that plan...didn't want to hassle with sending it back.Quality is very good.
3,Entertaining novel but bit limited,"Reading this old book was like reading a novelization of Shakespeare's play but Henry V in this book come out looking bit of a lightweight. I supposed since its fictional, author can take few liberties with the facts. I don't think the author understand historical period on which he was writing about. But the reading was lightweight as the subject, nicely paced and somewhat entertaining."
4,its ok,"its ok,this book shows some nice tricks, nothing fancy.a nice conversation starter and good for party's.enjoy! :-)"
3,Clear and Concise,"This is my first exposure to sleight-of-hand skills. The book is well developed, easy to follow and probably has something in it for everyone."
4,Worthwhile. Valuable checklists,"This book is a minimally-rewritten version of ""Taking Charge"" which Smith published a few years ago. The book contains useful and extremely pragmatic advice for managers and leaders. It is more oriented towards ""big shots"" than first line managers, but there is value for anyone who manages people. Biggest criticism--There is not an overriding theme in the book, it is a collection of chapters on individual subjects. Biggest attaboy--The book has a number of checklists that are useful. The author is a former military officer, and that shows in his examples, but the advice he gives is broadly applicable."
3,How is it so BIPOLAR?,"I haven't read the book, just the reviews... What is going on here? How is it possible to have such a love or hate perspective on this book? I guess I'll just have to judge it for myself..."
1,Don't believe the hype,Despite the author achievements (which he is quick to mention) he only seems to have a shallow grasp of leadership and management skills.
5,Outstanding down to earth guide for leaders at all levels!!!,"This is an excellent book for leaders at all levels. MG Smith makes it easy for one to adapt his suggestions to your own personal leadership situation and style. The chapters are independent in that if you want to read about creating a vision, you can go to chapter 14 and read about that without having read the previous chapters. It is written in an easy style. If you are not interested in a subject he covers, just skip it,but I found I read the whole thing cover to cover just to learn more. He also provides specific examples to explain points and he provides check lists for those of us who may need them. This is a must have book for leaders at all levels. I plan to buy a few for Christmas presents also!!"
2,"Great Pictures, Where's the Content?","I got this book in a class on MS Access, perhaps I went into it with too high of expectations, but the book is basically a wizard walkthru.If you have the basic ability to click ""Next"" on a wizard and select the basic styles you are already well beyond the scope of this book. Sixty percent of each page is full colored, often pointless, illlustrations about the task at hand. I recall one section where the book used three pages and three seperate diagrams to resize a text box on a form.Calling this book ""Comprehensive"" or applicable for the ""Expert"" skill level is like saying playdoh is the prefered material of master artisans."
5,very good buy,"this is the best book i have ever read in my life. it captures the true spirit of the untamable, and shows us all once we taste blood how can we stop ourselves."
3,"Entertaining, but not very real","Girlfight is a fun movie to watch, mostly because we have never seen a women in this role but half way through when the already obvious storyline becomes absurd, you start to feel that this movie is an insult to both men and women. While all the men in this film are laughable, it's strange that even the female boxer star of the film is made to look like a joke. We go into the movie wanting to believe in her but by the end it becomes impossible. If this movie really was based on the life of Lucia Rijkers, the remarkable women's champion who was so brilliantly depicted in the documentary Shadow Boxers, then they should have used Rijkers herself. At least you might believe she could fight with men, but then again, I doubt she's be interested in that."
4,Best of the three women's boxing movies I've seen..,"Out of ""The Opponent"" and ""Knockout,"" Girlfight was probably the best of the thre movies. The other two had more of a fight babe effect than an actual movie about a femal boxer. The acting and script is much better in this film as well. The boxing, however, is not quite there in all three movies though. Moves were kinda sloppy with all the dropped hands and rabbit punches. Someone definitely needs to train these girls more if they want to see more like legitimate boxers on the silver screen. But as a dramatic movie, Girlfight wins in the entertainment factor. Well, as some said, it does get weak towards the end of the movie. I was kinda left bewildered as to what direction they were trying to go at the end so I was left a bit unsatisfied. But I think the first 3/4 of the movie is strong enough to entertain someone that they'd still like to see movie despite the ending."
1,fast forward not fast enough,utter boredom. the fighting was more like lovers enjoying a passionate scramble. More American rubbish
1,"Terrible film, transparent, obvious and violent!","Viewing this movie was an incredible waste of time. Very contrived, very obvious, with a complete lack of plot twists and lack of a good script in general.This is just another ""feel good"" movie, that will not stand the test of time.Plus this movie embraces violence, and advocates boxing for women! I do not even believe boxing should be permitted for men! And where do women hit each other.... In the head, mostly!Two huge thumbs down on this one...."
2,Yawn . . .,"I really wanted to like this movie. I heard lots of good reviews about it and expected nothing but good.10 minutes into the movie, I could see that Michell Rodriquez was a pretty girl, but not a great actress. She acts and sounds like your average schmo on the street who's reading a script in monotone.The story itself could've been edited. Sometimes I completely lapsed out, it was so slow. ANd how predictable. OF course Diana was gonna meet a good-looking fellow boxer, fall in love with him, then when a big fight in the end.A movie about an angry girl who does good is an interesting idea, but sorry to say, Karyn Kusama did not try hard enough.I'm Asian, but that doesn't mean I'm going to lie and say I think Karyn made a good film."
3,girls can pack a mean punch too,"Having heard a lot about this movie for years, I was disappoint to finally watch it and see that it's more a love story than a true depiction of a girl, a woman, breaking through the barriers of a male-dominated society and getting into boxing. Although the movie does have a boxing storyline at its center, it often looses its way in its overall theme and stumbles. Michelle Rodriguez though, has a natural knack for acting (this is her debut role) and tends to make the best of her moody scenes. Overall, this is a good indie feature but it's hardly an earth-shattering film."
2,deceptively titled... look elsewhere.,"I'll keep it short; The book is hardly a ""guide"". It's a poorly written, unnecessarily opinionated overview of Swatches...That said, it does feature some interesting historical and production sections. The author glosses over various models, with nice photos and layouts. Unfortunately, worthwhile text in the book is overshadowed by tiresome blathering, as if readers need pictures described to them... Don't pay too much, or read too much, lest you regret it."
5,Jazz Without Borders,"Barret Martin has done it again! After experiencing ""The Painted Desert"", I hardly expected that the second CD could keep up and maintain the groove. Well, he did it! Earthspeaker is another jazz-o-matic experience into the altered state of global fusion. ""Earthspeaker"" combines past and present with cultural motifs set upon silky smooth surface. ""Earthspeaker"" is natural jazz with no contrivance. ""Earthspeker"" is jazz transcending the borders of time and culture. ""The Painted Desert"", and ""Earthspeaker"" are the kinds of CD's that find play under many conditions. Cleaning the house on a rainy day, a romantic dinner or cruising a desert stretch in Nevada, wherever you're going, ""Earthspeaker"" will take you there."
2,pleasant enough but...,"The music on Earthspeaker deserves four stars. But I have to take away two stars because of the inane liner notes. In the liner notes, Barrett claims to believe that Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad were all prophets. This type of statement is usually made by people who are lashing out against Christianity. (Putting Jesus on the same level with Moses and Muhammad is a transparent jab at Christianity.)In the liner notes, Barrett also says that Israel is some kind of holy land. This means that Barrett has probably been brainwashed by Zionist propaganda.He probably also believes that Muslim extremists carried out 9-11 (even though there is no real evidence to support such a theory).In fairness, Barrett Martin grew up in the foothills of the Tumwater Brewery. This could explain why he is susceptible to being brainwashed."
1,What Happened to the Rao's recipe,I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 6 months) the recipe has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe.Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.I would be interested in other opinions.Sign me an unhappy customer.
2,"too dated,slow moving","These books are too dated, being based in the fifties, that I found it really and slow moving and boring"
2,The Con Man (87th Precinct),"STORY IS INTERESTING BUT OFTEN PREDICTABLE AND DATED. REALIZING THAT THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, IT SHOULD BE RE-EDITED AND WHERE POSSIBLE, MODERNIZED."
2,Not his best,"Ed McBain is not at his best with this boring , dull book. The characters do not come to life., nor does the story."
4,Simple and entertaining,A very easy read. Kept me interested all the way through!I will probably read more from this author soon.
2,Boring,"I felt that the author basically used filler to make this story a book. The actual mystery was ok, but the off-track info did not add to the story. I was bored with the book and will not read another story."
3,A unique underworld read hi,Pretty good book about some people we hope never to encounter. The ending is very satisfactory and reached us to beware of strangers offering gifts.
3,Easy read,Likable characters and interesting enough plot to keep me reading to the end. Nothing unique but still fairly entertaining. Would read another McBain novel to see how it compares.
3,Slow start,"Lengthy introduction, when the story gained momentum, it was a jump start. I really enjoyed these characters, getting to know them more intimately creates a relationship that craves a sequel...."
1,short,I had just purchased my Kindle when I downloaded this book and didn't realize it was so short. I will try not to make that same mistake.
2,wheres the bass,i thought buying a DnB album would ensure i get my 2500 watt sound system to shatter the windows in my car but it simply wasn't there....the music was produced well and the beats were very eclectic but they simply lacked the bass in terms of mega hertz. not really much else to say. i'm a bass fanatic and if the music is good but the beat doesn't hit hard it takes away from the overall effect.
4,He's a genius,"Anyone who has the skills to combine rap, reggae, pop and dnb with this caliber of people deserves major props. Personally, I think this is the best Aphrodite CD to date. It does have a lot of lyrics, but somehow he brings it all together. I don't want to start a battle, but I think this slams Dieselboy's Project Human. It appealed to me probably because of my hip hop upbringing. This will be the future of hip hop as well as DnB. I gave the CD 4 stars because there were so many points he could have blown up my world with this CD. He is a build master, but doesn't make the builds Blow Up like I hoped he would. This is an excellent release. Well worth buying."
5,Reluctant Warrior,"This book is an outstanding account of recon battalion actions in Vietnam. It is well worth reading. I served with Mike before the war. He was a straight shooter then, and a straight shooter in Vietnam"
5,No one has done it better,"My husband and I have owned this movie and watched it 5-times. We originally had a TV copy, then we bought the VHS and DVD versions from Amazon.This movie is simply one the best, most under rated movies to hit the screen. Aside from the sheer volume of acting talent, writing and atmosphere...the thing that hits you immediately during the opening scene is the music. It is plain, haunting, not intrusive and I would consider it an extra ""character and actor"" in its presence.This movie is so moving, especially now that Paul Newman has passed. You owe it to yourself to see the movie and own the soundtrack to continue the warm feelings it leaves you with.Simply speaking, the movie, the music..fits together like a glove. What a wonderful experience!!"
2,Received free with another purchase...,"And that is about what it is worth. I purchased a small appliance and this came free with it from Amazon. After using it a few times I will return to my other crock pot. The lid is designed so the moisture is captured on the outer ring, and the lid tends to ""float"" on the moisture. When something is cooking the lid will start vibrating as if there were an earthquake.The ""Keep Warm"" setting should be labeled ""Overcook"". Not only did it keep it warm, but it kept it so hot that the contents overcooked. The Keep Warm setting is extremely hot, nearly as hot as the High setting."
1,hot cooker,"I love cooking meat in a crockpot because it breaks apart, but no matter what temp I try cooking at with this thing, even keep warm, it comes out like shoe leather. It cooks so hot the lid bounces up and down and the liquid boils. I don't recommend this."
5,Great value,The price was $4.99 when I bought mine. Can't beat that! I needed to replace my old 4 quart slow cooker and could not pass up this bargain. Add some bean soup mix or chili starter with a wooden spoon and a slow cooker recipe book for a nice gift. Like another reviewer stated... this is a series E and is not on the recall list. Tried it out last night and it worked just fine.
1,"Cooks Too Hot, Everything Comes Out Brown","No matter what I cook in this slow cooker, it comes out brown, tough, and overcooked. I would NOT recommend this AT ALL. Rival makes a much better line of products, and I CAN recommend those. Avoid this one at all costs. It's not even worth the $26.00 I paid for it."
5,Simple & performs as promised,"This is my third crockpot, and my first that isn't the Rival brand. For what it is, this a great crockpot. It holds enough for a small serving of meat (1-2 people), side dishes, or my favorite, cake! (Yes, you can bake cake in a crockpot, give it a try sometime). It does just have a manual dial, so if you want something programmable, that probably wouldn't work for you. However, if you're looking for a no-frills basic slow cooker, this would fit the bill."
4,"Purchased in 2003, and it's still going strong....","I am using this today to make stew. I needed to verify the size to calculate carbs for the recipe and searched through my purchases until I located it...So, thought, as long as I was here I would add my two cents...I received this as a premium with another appliance in November of 2003, even though I had a larger slow cooker, I thought the price was right, and it would make a nice secondary unit!Instead, I find I use it more than the large one.I knocked off one star for the noisy sloppy lid...;0))PK"
5,Great for Strength and Inspiration,"The actual title(I'm sure it's not Amazon's fault - I am really not trying to be insulting, seriously)is: ""Satan, the Blood is Against You"". I have owned two copies of this video. It is about the power of the shed Blood of Jesus against Satan. (The Blood is not against us.) Bishop Jakes gives a true revelation of God. This video was especially inspiring for me since it talks about the two sons, and a few examples of two brothers in the Bible like Esau and Jacob, etc. It helped me because I had two sons and lost one.True to life. If anyone does not believe, just ask Him to reveal himself and you will surprisingly pleased and happier than ever."
3,solid text w/ great detail,huge quantities of social history from a very specific time period. of particular note is the information on the role of women in the business/ social structure of the community. highly recommended for every english medievalist.
3,Standard reference,"Okell's grammar is the standard reference for Burmese and still the best description of the language. If you are a linguist, avoid the others and try to find a copy of this."
3,Does Sibelius get a nod here?,"I just saw the 1983 movie again, and looked to see if they gave any music credit to the true composer of the main theme, Jean Sibelius. The theme was taken from the second movement of his 2nd symphony. Does anyone know if credit is in fact given?"
1,Very Poorly produced cd-r,"Bought this soundtrack and have no issue with the music which other reviewers cover expertly 5 stars for music ..But unfortunately the cd/booklet cover art work is very poorly produced and instead of sitting proudly on a cd shelf it is in a drawer....Amazon please monitor production of these ""On Demand"" cds"
3,Funny But At Times Morbid,"Gideon Oliver's wife Julie takes a more active role in this story set mostly in rural Oregon. The story has elements of a good Elkins book with another lesson in forensic anthropology. At times it is very funny and in spots is quite morbid. Although the proposed motive for the killings is unconvincing, Julie's enhanced role makes the reading worthwhile."
3,"Spectacular setting & premise, poor ending & motive","I've had enough of Julie for awhile. Oh she solves it again, isn't she wonderful!? Not. And oh he loves her so much, isn't that wonderful?! Not. She so much smarter somehow than her highly-educated anthropologist husband and his experienced FBI agent friend?! Not.This Gideon Oliver mystery installment was wonderful in its idea of an anthropologists' convention, and that the anthropologists would have such vast knowledge, and such. And the bones turning out to be whose they were was a great treat too.But overall where was the mystery? There was no satisfaction as to the motive, no satisfaction for the reader as to the old murders themselves. The book just sort of ends quickly wrapping it all up in this lame excuse of a motive. This was probably my least favorite Aaron Elkins yet."
5,Gideon Oliver is my favorite of the Elkin's characters!,I adore Aaron Elkin's books. I especially love the Gideon Oliver mysteries. Elkins is one of my favorite authors and I really enjoyed this book! I would highly recommend this book to any fan of mysteries. it is well written and very attention holding. A great read!
3,One exciting happening after an other!,"After, the plot took shape, it was exciting and thrilling. There were interesting facts and good anthropological references."
1,Must remind myself not to spend time with books like this.,"Crappy mystery novel about a forensic anthropologist convention. Very poorly written. Uninteresting plot, not well constructed, full of characters that never felt real or were cared about. Completely not worth the time I put into it. One or two interesting points, and the fact that it wasn't actually offensive, are all that save this book from being awarded the lowest grade. Must remind myself not to spend time with books like this in the future."
4,Beauty,"This soundtrack is one that American directors should ingest into their systems. Why does one have to be subjected to Forrest Gumpesque film trailors in America when film music such as this exists in other countries. This is not the greatest music that Takemitsu composed, however that is not an insult. This music gives the young film composer hope that one day he may be approached with projects that demand these types of scores."
2,Good performance but you hear the players breathing,The performances are very good but they must have closely miked all the players because you hear them breathing which is very iritating. This is very apparent in all the works most of which are string pieces.
4,A Cute Little Story,"It's an interesting twist on the old ""the prince must marry!"" tale. The Queen insists that her son marries...he agrees though he's not big on princesses. One after another parades in front of him until Princess Madeline brings along her brother, Prince Lee. Love blooms and they live happily ever after.There is little to worry about this book: it's about two people who meet and fall in love. The fact that they are both princes is irrelevant. The book doesn't say that this is right or wrong, just that it makes them both happy. The Queen just seems pleased that her son is happy ~ again she doesn't judge the situation.Most of the kids I read this to never caught on to the political ramifications of same-sex marriage. They just enjoyed it. The multimedia artwork is a tad distracting, but the kids enjoyed seeing it.Teachers may want to use this book as an introduction to multi-media art and follow it up with similiar crafts"
1,Should come with a warning,"Imagine an unsuspecting parent of young children reading this book to them and realizing, at the critical point, that the the guy is ""into"" guys.Children who are old enough to ""get it"" are unlikely to be still reading picture books. Children young enough to be listening to or reading picture books are unlikely to understand why the prince prefers princes. Unless a child has a close relative or family friend who is gay, there is undoubtedly a better venue to teach them about homosexuality."
1,Poisonous to young minds,"While I was reading this story to my five year old, I was so shocked and enraged to see the obscene image with the vivid graphic illustration of two princesses kissing in their wedding on the last page of the book. As an adult, I do believe that each human being deserve the freedom to choose his/her partner. But for kids as young as those at elementary schools, this book brings no educational value but disturbs and poisons their minds when they don't even know what the love and the marriage is. I got this book from my local public library, and I regretted so much that I did not pre-screen it. To be warned, this book is not suitable for elementary school kids as the book suggested. I hate the author's intent to bring debatable sex issues in the adult world to the pure and innocent lives of young children!"
1,"Diversity = Man + Woman, Not King & King!","This book teaches kids the worst aspects of sex discrimination. The king says 'I've never cared much for princesses', marginalizing women and making it seem like it's macho to exclude women. Then the king rejects all kinds of women because of superficial physical characteristics. To top it off, the king selects another man as his 'prince' and then they kiss at the end.By definition, homosexuality separates men and women. It will NEVER allow gender diversity or equality in the name of 'love'. Why do we want to be teaching kids that love is about excluding and separating people simply because they are a different gender?""Separate is not equal!""One man, one woman is uniquely inclusive gender diversity and equality. Let's keep it that way! Let's not turn back the clock 50 years when same-race orientation (racism) was fashionable and separated blacks and whites."
1,Gay Propaganda,"This book aims at infiltrating young minds and indoctrinating children into the gay agenda. The story actively promotes homosexuality, with the purpose of steering children towards a gay lifestyle choice. This book represents gay propaganda at its most insidious. Don't believe a word of the fatally flawed rhetoric of the gay agenda, which amounts to a pack of lies dressed up in academic and politically correct fluff and nonsense. Keep your kids away from this book, and keep this book out of school and public libraries."
4,Interesting read,I bought this book to help with my grandchildren. They have a Gay Uncle and I wanted to help make them understand. The book was an opening for a conversation that answered some questions they had. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child that is curious.
1,What about it's merits as a book?,"Blah.This book wan't really very good. Not because it had homosexuals in it - but because the writing was bland, and the art made my eyes hurt. The art was like a collage where all the peices don't fit right.And the story... I just felt like ""who cares?"" There wasn't anything to give it much of a twist besides the homosexuality. That won't intrest a kid much, and it didn't intrest me."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I bought this Item and with shipping it was just under $20. You could rub a $20 bill on your calluses and get better results. It's way to under-powered for anything other than gluing feathers on it and using it as a duster (you want to use ""very small"" feathers or the wind resistance might stop the motor). Sorry about the 1 star rating but there was no -3 star ratingS Hayes 12/19/08"
2,product review,I was not impressed with this item. I do not recommend it. It stops spinning when the slightest pressure is applied. It did not work as I expected it to.
4,Driver problem but Good otherwise,"I was unable to get my IBM ThinkPad (P-4m,2ghz, XP SP2) to recognize this card when using the Adaptec drivers. A friend used it with no problem by letting XP install it without the Adaptec drivers. I had to re-install XP to get rid of the Adaptec stuff and then it worked great with the XP drivers. Card itself works good, just a driver issue."
1,"Won't work, no tech support from Adaptec","Just bought this product in June of 2008 and tried to use it. Got a message from my Dell Inspiron 600m running Windows XP that the Adaptec caused a power surge and that it exceeds the power limits of my notebook and I had to disconnect it. I asked Adaptec about solutions, but they tell me ""We are very sorry but the status of support period for your product has expired long back on 21st March 2007."" They refuse to give me any information. Guess I'll be sending it back!"
1,Foolish material by foolish people,"Quite simply, just reactionary foolishness from people who ought to know better but are hopelessly lost in religion. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, at least they have read through the material, but they don't understand the games. Very dated. Pretty much useless. The only reason I even saw the book was a local library had a copy. I certainly would never buy it."
1,BURNED UP,"I am ereding and collecting all this ANTI d&d literature trying to understand how they can ALL be so wrong. There are two good explanations, These authors never learn how to play the game from the rulebooks. They simply quote each others nonsense. Playing With Fire has the ""advantage"" of putting all the ridiculous and erroneous comments about D&D in one place."
1,Another waste of time..,"Basically this book has not given any values to a hobby so loved and played all over the world. A game that explores imagination, promotes arithematics, writing and literacy cannot be more bad then doing drugs and guns.This a game and pursuit, and like violent computer games who has their fair share of blame when it comes to teenagers going on a shooting spree, cult worship, satanism has been linked time again to RPGs.Whether as matured adults or teenagers, moderation is important along our education, and so is guidance. IF your kids is doing RPGs and you have no idea..it is bad..if they are reading it and you are not providing guidance and dismissed it straight away, they might even go underground and become more rebellious, and this is bad...If something is not of your taste then don't do it, but dont kill people because they dont share the same vision as you."
4,Flying Saucer Tour,"This is an album of one of Hicks' sets in it's entirety and shows how he carried on in the face of a lack lustre audience and with heckling. It isn't necessarily the best place to start if you're new to Hicks. I'd say it's more for die hard fans who want something extra. Parts of it are uncomfortable to listen to and yet it is compelling the whole way through. A worthy addition to Hicks' catalogue, but not the best example of his unique and outstanding comedy.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,A SEEMINGLY NEVERENDING EVENT!,i TRIED TO GET INTO THIS STORY BUT IT WAS ONE SCENARIO AFER ANOTHER AND i JUST GOT TIRED OF READING ABOUT THE SAME OLD BATTLE WITH JUST SLIGHT DIFFERENCES.
1,This is a bad buy,No on screen lyrics and no lyric sheet in the jewel case makes this a bad buy and a useless disk to own.
1,disappointed grease fan,This is a terrible purchase. There are no lyrics on the screen and no lyrics to follow along with in the CD itself. BAD DEAL!
4,Really relaxing,"I work at a coffeehouse and we have a jukebox with this CD in it. I am constantly listening to it while I am opening the shop up for the day and people are always putting money into listen to it. With the ecclectic mix of DnB and Acid Jazz swirled together, it makes for a nice relaxing CD. I would reccomend this to people who are looking for a chillout CD after a hard day at work when work has been really stressful. Stick this in the CD player, press play and pop a nice glass of zinfindel and sit, listen and relax."
5,A Must Read for All Southern Baptist Pastors,If you missed the original edition of this book in the 1980's then you have a great reading experience ahead of you. Dr. Bush and Dr. Nettles explain in this book why Baptists have changed their view of the Bible over the years.If you don't understand why there are so many opinions and disagreements among Southern Baptists today then read this book and your eyes will be opened and your mind will be stretched as you follow the history of Baptists and their view of the Bible from the 1600's to the present day.
5,Baptists and the Bible,"This book was also written by D. L. Russell Bush, good reading and study material. He was a local man from our hometown."
4,BEST SEASON.,"THIS SEASON HAS MORE BETTER EPISODES THAN THE FIRST. NOT AS BORING. THE BONUS MATERIAL HAS B&W AND COLOR. NOW US THAT WANTED THE 2ND SEASON OF THE MUNSTERS IN COLOR. SEEN IN THE BONUS FEATURES WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE AWESOME. NOT LIKE OTHERS SAW ON TV. THAT COLOR IS GONE. WITH B&W IT DOES NOT SHOW IT'S TRUE BEAUTY. I READ WHERE IT COST 10,000 TO AIR THE EPISODES IN COLOR. IT MIGHT OF COST MORE TO DO THIS SEASON IN COLOR. SO THATS WHY THEY LEFT IT IN B&W."
3,Censored Episode - How can you in the 21st century???,"This is the best TV series of my childhood. Needless to say, I was very happy to find it available on DVD boxsets. 2 stars must be deducted though because the best Episode ever is not on the DVD!After all this unaired material the producers could have lifted silly 1960s moral bans to make the fans happy. But no, that one was left out once again!Episode 55, Just Another Pretty Face is a corrected episode: Herman gets zapped by lightening in Grandpas lab and turns normal without makeup, Lilly fails to find him attractive anymore.This Episode has a censored predecessor, censored not to upset or enforce the gay community:Herman gets zapped by lightening and turns into a goldilock Heidi type, exchanging nail polish comments with Lilly on the breakfast table.Aired in Europe, I was able to see it!I demand this episode to be included, after all we live in 21st century! Shame on the producers to dissappoint the fans so vastly!"
1,2nd season of munsters dvd set stops at about 1hour 20 seconds,the second season of the munsters dvd set is defective. i believe AFTER the episode where lily and marliyn work in the salon the next episode it locks in the middle of the episode. i bought a total of 4 dvds (maybe the first 2 were defective but NOT the case no matter what dvd u purchase its defective you cant watch the remaining episodes of the second season. what a joke! My 4 dvds cost me about $ 70.00 can i get my money back should i call universal they are the seller i want my money. What recourse do i have?? big problem!! Not 1 second season dvd works they are all defective!!
4,Another great Munster Set,"Even though, i like this set, i didnt like it as much as the first. All the episodes were great to see again (and even some were on there that i've missed), anyways, the worst thing i hated was the way it was package...lets be real!..it sucked!, but, that didnt matter to me as long as all the episodes were playing good and not boring...which they were not, so, im rateing whats inside not out. If you a true Munsters fan, you'll love this set as the first as long as you can get by the way it has been packaged you'll be find. Recommended!!"
5,Herman is sooo funny~,"After watching The Munsters at my home when my [..]grandson would spend the night, I purchased this for him. He loves Herman! He started watching it at home and his sisters and mother started watching it with him. They are all addicted to the Munsters now! It's nice to know that you can allow a child to watch a show that is humorous and nothing offensive in it."
4,Great price,One of my favorites when I was a kid. On sale when I purchased it for a great price. Wish they had a sale on the first version.
5,Munsters were Monster Fun!,"This is my favorite season cause of Episodes like The Fergosi Emerald, Zombo, Grandpa's Lost Wife,Herman Master Spy, Eddies Brother and my favorites Will Success Spoil Herman Munster and JustAnother Pretty Face!!! Fred Gwynn without makeup playing Herman is pricelss. I like the bonusfeatures and Fred Gwynn story! If you got the first set buy this! Monster Good fun!"
4,A very humorous and educational Arabic language resource,"The proverbs in the book range from common, to downright hilarious. They are printed in Arabic with english translations. A fantastic resource for students of Arabic at all levels."
4,A small collection of Egyptian wisdom,"This is a fun book with a relatively innovative idea. It includes a sample of Egyptian proverbs accompanied with illustrations and written in Arabic with English translation. Most proverbs are quite funny, but they also reflect much wisdom in their meaning. This is a very pleasant book which can be a helpful aid in learning the language."
4,Zero Patience (the music),"I saw this movie and was completely floored at how much I liked it. Who knew that a musical, done in the 90's, about, of all things AIDS, would be so good. I found myself tapping dancing and wanting to sing to the soundtrack so off I went to buy a copy of the wonderful music.The music CD music recording quality isn't quite as good as that of the movie I've found though it was still good and I still enjoy listening to those songs I so enjoyed in the movie. Some of the remixes were very good and made the album worth to purchase price to get those wonderful pieces from yet another perspective. I recommend it if you've seen the movie and if not I recommend that you see the movie and if you, as I, enjoy it then it's worth the purchase price.Best to all."

5,Great Product,Protects my Treo 750 - sure does the job! A bit bulky for a woman - I wouldn't put it on my belt. But its good to place in purse and know that my Treo won't get scratched while getting tossed in there.
2,Great Idea VERY poor design,where do i begin. Great Idea and concept that was not thought out AT ALL. I was looking for a hard case that did not put pressure on my buttons due to the many auto updates and e-mail checks my phone does during the day. This case does that but wow is this case cheap plastic just waiting to crack and WAY to easy to accidentally open and drop your 300.00 investment on the floor into pieces. The device needs to be made of stonger material have a saftey cath that when you ope the case it holds your phone in till you decide to take it out. Finally this case needs a LOCK it is way to easy to bumb the clip open and have your phone fall on the ground. I am sure this won't last more than a week for me. Already cracked the clips to hold it open at 45 degree angle.
5,Interesting and authoritative,"Dr. Sullivan presents a fascinating account of an important--but often overlooked--era in the American Civil Rights movement. Days of Hope is an authoritative account of the roots of the civil rights struggle. The book is interesting, comprehensive, and impeccably sourced and researched. A must for any student of the movement."
3,Not what I expected,"I picked out this watch for it's features. I wanted an easy to read (day or night) watch that was waterproof and stainless steel. I guess I should have kept looking. First and foremost is the annoying clasp. The foldover mechanism digs into my wrist making it umcomfortable after only an hour. The band occasionally pulls on the tiny hairs on my arm, and the glow in the dark feature stops working after about 3 hours. This is not particularly helpful when it's time to feed the baby at 3am and I can't see the watch.All in all I am pretty disappointed in my first ""expensive"" watch. I never had these problems with my Timex."
2,It's just not good.,"Unfortunately, the episode on this DVD (Pisastro's Private War) is the SAME episode featured on Captain Fathom Volume One! So, if you own volume one, don't bother purchasing this DVD.""Pisastro's Private War"" is somewhat entertaining: these two leaders of small nations have a misunderstanding, and as a result they ""attempt"" to wage war on eachother. With the exception of Captain Fathom and his crew, all the characters in this episode are absolutely silly and even obnoxious. I simply could not take this episode seriously.This DVD does feature 2 amusing Clutch Cargo episodes, but you can get Clutch Cargo episodes just about anywhere. Besides that, the DVD is entitled ""Captain Fathom,"" not ""Clutch Cargo."" Do you see my point? I don't recommend this DVD unless you are absolutely desperate, and DON'T PAY MORE THAN A DOLLAR FOR IT! If you are looking for a variety of Captain Fathom episodes, then Captain Fathom Volume Two is better."
5,Turn this CD's volume up...and you are at the concert!,"Of the many tapes of live shows I have heard, ""Light Fuse Getaway"" offers the best in not only the best live-sound recording, but an excellent selection from the many songs Widespread Panic has to offer. This is the way Widespread is meant to be heard. If you can't see them live, this is the next best thing to it."
5,NEXT BEST THING TO LIVE.....,"Although you really have to see this band live to believe it, this album does a great service in giving fans a taste of it. The album truly captures the excitement of the live shows. I would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a tight-sounding band that jams long and hard....it's an honest tune with a lingering lead that's taken me this far."
4,At their best live.,"Widespread Panic is one of those bands who have put out good records but is really at their best is a live setting. These two discs feature many extended jams that only add to what was done in the studio. Although the songs are generally long, they are never boring because the rythm section keeps things tight and always in a steady groove. These songs do not meander. They lock into a groove and hold it there so that the solos are alowed to breath. It's quite a bit of music to sit through, but it holds up with repeated listenings. If your a fan of live recordings ang long jams, this is a good band to check out."
5,Better than Sliced Bread!!!,"I've been listening to the Panic since '90, when I heard C. Brown in the seventh grade. As a UGA student, 8 years later, I had the great pleasure of being one of the 80000+ in attendance at the Washington Street CD Release Party in Athens, marking my best memory with the band. This album definitely captures the live energy of the band, from Dave Schools' incredible base solos to John ""JoJo"" Hermann on the keys. There is also a little treat with Marsalis on Pickin' up the Pieces. After hearing this album, you'll never want to miss a live show again."
2,"Didn't know ""Excellent Condition"" rating meant skips","Awesome live disc by great band. Too bad both discs (despite rated ""excellent condition"") had multiple skips on them. Tried them on multiple CD / DVD players with same result. Returned item for refund - very discouraging."
3,I just wish they had a really nasty guitarist,"you know, one who could but out a nasty solo. the solos get a little monotonous after a while."
2,I just love them,"I never heard about them before I bought this CD. Now,I cant get enough of them.If you like The dead,Widespread panic are a band for you.Now Igot all the cd`s they hawe made."
1,a biassed book,"I read the Chinese edition of this book when I visited Hong Kong. It is just like many books on the Sino-Japanese War printed in Chinese language: a mixture of war-time propaganda and reports (Cheng is on the side of Kuomintang, and a very chauvinistic map that includes Mongolia as part of China is shown on the cover).For the best account on this subject, Dick Wilson's 'When Tigers Fight' is still the best choice."
4,A Tender Toddler Tale,"Grumpy. Stumpy. Lumpy. Plumpy. Little Bartholomew wakes up on the wrong side of his toddler bear bed. But a big gentle bear named George loves him just the way he is. George thaws out Bartholomew with a cozy scarf, a steaming bowl of porridge, a warm bath, and finally gentle words. Author illustrator Virginia Miller wrote this after her first book about the little bear with the big name, On Your Potty, grew in popularity. She enhances her spare text (only 109 words) with illustrations outlined in wide pencil and colored with soft, earth-toned markers. Ba is now out of diapers, but does not seem to be out of his &#65533;Terrible Two&#65533; stage. This tender tale of unconditional love is sure to warm your own heart. If you&#65533;d like to read more about this adorable bear, I recommend the book Bartholomew Bear, a collection of five toddler tales at a great price."
2,This Product didn't work for me,"This digital compass didn't work in my truck, Dodge Dakota. I couldn't get it to calibrate even tho I moved it several places on my dash. Also if left in the sun on the dash, it seemed to go haywire."
1,Must be mounted as shown,"If you try to mount it flush (base parallel to display), the unit will not work. I returned it for this reason, plus the display is too busy and the fonts were designed by someone without knowledge of the English language"
4,new compass,"Really like the new compass. Purchased it because it can be positioned on the dash of my RAV4. The new vehicle has the back up camera feature which takes up a good portion of the rear view mirror each time the vehicle is placed in reverse. Did not want a mirror mounted compass for that reason.Had a bit of difficulty getting it programmed, but it is working well now & seems to be very accurate."
1,"This ""compass"" is a piece of cr-p.",I only got a few weeks of unreliable use before this thing quit completely. A complete waste of $40 and a lot of aggravation.
1,Poor product set up!,"I purchased this digital compass from Amazon. The compass never was able to set up from day one. I followed the direction to the letter, but no go. Do not buy this product. It is a waste of $40.Happy Amazon customer."
2,compass,I wasn't able to calibrate this compass in spite of numerous attempts. I don't know if it was because of my car or the compass. It's also hard to read and the Velcro came off right away.
1,Dont buy this compass,This device is a decoration and not a compass. It is not accurate and will not function in an automobile setting. I returned the one I bought. Please save yourself the trouble. It is misnamed and in my opinion is junk.
2,Disappointed,"Great compact Design. Problems: 1) when you press the display light the light stayed on for only 2 seconds; impossible to use at night time; the light switch should have remained on until turned off. 2) No matter how many times we reset the compass and driven the car in circles, the directional indicator was always set between S and E no matter what direction we were headed in."
5,The Best....but,....they are now out of stock! PLEASE RESTOCK THESE SHEETS!!! They are the best flannel sheets for the money. They are so soft wash after wash. Where are they??
5,Great sheet set!,"These are soft and cozy; plus plenty big and don't bunch up after washing. Like another reviewer mentioned, they do come with King pillowcases. I ordered another pair. We plan on using them all year long, and we live in the desert! We love these sheets!"
3,Cozy,"Nice bedsheets, warm and cozy. Although they could be softer and thicker, I think it was a good buy for the money."
5,Amazing!,The best sheet set I've ever purchased...at an amazing price too! The Oatmeal color is also very soft and light. I love it in every way! I don't want to get out of bed in the morning because it's so soft.
5,Great Sheets! Great Price!,"After hearing many of my family and friends talk about how wonderful flannel sheets are, I decided to buy them for our beds as well as our two kids' beds. They are great! Nice and soft and warm as can be. With the high cost of heating recently, and living in Pennsylvania, I must say this was not only a good investment for comfort, but for saving money because now we can turn our heat down a bit.I had been pricing good flannel sheets for a long time, this is the best price available. Great Value!"
5,Very comfy,Good value and extremely comfortable. One of my friends even compared the texture to washable suede - v. flattering!
1,Disoraganized;Inaccurate;Bad Humor,"I did not enjoy this film. I feel like the film poked fun at people who are blind, and made it sound like some un-livable curse. Besides that, the whole idea of the procedure to make the blind main character see again is not believable; when he first ""sees"", he says he can see white and black, and a square shape. He's been blind his entire life! He wouldn't know what he was seeing at all! Let alone what colors or shapes he's seeing!I think his desire for a relationship was believable and realistic, but again, I think the women he dated were written into the story to poke fun more than anything, and the result was not in the least bit funny. His relationship with the Indian woman from the clinic was honest and believable, but I think her family problems were distracting from the main character's story, and that angle wasn't very interesting."
4,Winner for Chris Pine fans,"If you like Chris Pine, as I do, you'll enjoy this movie. It's a comical story. A little crude at times, but overall a cute movie. It's not a blockbuster but was worth watching. I thought it was endearing how Pine's character's family rallies around him as he tries to cope and mature with his blindness. Danny's (Pine) brother Larry is hilarious! He sets him up on some blind dates that are unbelievable and just cracked me up! And it was a new appreciation for cultural differences as Danny falls in love with an Indian girl. Like I said, comical and at times laugh-out-loud funny. Pine is a far cry from James T. Kirk or FDR Foster in this one, but certainly entertaining."
5,decent movie,"I actually was not that impressed with the story. It's very cheesy and cliched, but Chris Pine's performance just took my breath away. His acting reminded me of Emily Watson as Reba McClane in Red Dragon (:I know friend who is a little like Danny's character. I've never seen her use a cane, and although she's got a guide dog, the dog is more of a pet. Sometimes, it's hard to think that she's blind. Pine makes it seem as if he really is blind.Pine did a wonderful job as Danny, and his good looks and impossibly blue eyes make me like him even more.I'm a sucker for romance and a pretty face, and although this movie is not the best, the acting itself makes Blind Dating worth a watch."
5,Blind Dating,"I loved this movie! My son and I watched it as a rental downstream on my blu ray player. We both really enjoyed this movie. Chris Pine did an awesome job playing a blind man. This obviously isn't a Golden Globe nominee movie, but rather a great sit down and have family fun movie. I loved the plot, the comedy hit just right, even the little ""odd"" or ""quirky"" parts fit in perfect. My son even commented afterwards that he wished there were more movies out like this one. It's nice to sit down and watch a fun loving and hassle free movie every once in awhile, and this is that movie!"
5,Naughty but charming,"I enjoyed this romantic comedy directed by James Keach (The Long Riders) and starring Chris Pine (Smokin' Aces) and Eddie Kaye Thomas ( American Pie ). It's difficult to come across a film that not only makes you really laugh but also touches your heart on the journey. I could understand how hard it would be telling a story about a blind person and the odd humorous circumstances they may find themselves in trying to go on blind date (No pun intended) and being politically corrected as to distract one from the story. Well they did it perfectly here with this little gem. If you like Wedding Crashers and Sleepless in Seattle, you will love this story!"
4,Great Chris Pine Movie,"I saw the new Star Trek a couple weeks ago and it was awesome. I believe Chris Pine will become famous now because of it. So i went and checked out his few other movies. Princess Diaries 2 and Just My Luck were ok but im not into the Disney type. Then I bought Blind Dating and was glad i did. It is a very cute movie that has heart. Its funny, cute, and sad. I found myself laughing at parts and then tearing up later. Danny (Chris Pine) is a 22yr old blind man that goes on many blind dates to find a nice girl. Its also about how he deals with being blind. Eddie Kaye Thomas plays his brother, and Jane Seymour plays his psychiatrist. Both are believeable and great for their parts. Chris Pine is the best part of this movie and very talented in this role. I'm glad I got this movie because its a nice little movie that I will watch again and again."
2,My dog loves it,"This canned chicken doesn't taste too bad--but it is just mush (with tiny bits of bone). Pay attention when you are ordering. I accidentally ended up with this stuff. I tried to make salad with it and it was soupy, even after I had squeezed out as much liquid as possible. It is a funny color red, also. I've been mixin' it into my dog's dry food and he is thrilled!"
5,A staple in our house,"I am so glad that Amazon carries this product. We are no longer able to find it in the grocery stores, but it is an integral ingredient in one of my wife's signature dishes - Chicken and Rice. We've tried other canned chicken, but it just isn't the same. My wife's Chicken and Rice is comfort food for our family and without the Mixin' Chicken, the comfort is missing. Great product."
1,does not look like the drawing on can,"This product tastes ok, but pretty high fat for canned chicken-I ordered it too quickly without checking out the nutirional count available . It looks NOTHING like the drawing on the can, but a LOT like baby food , or pet food-my cats enjoy it! For me-I mixed it with some mayo and made a spread out of it"
5,I love this stuff,"I have always preferred this to the canned white breast chicken because it's more moist and flavorful. It's perfect for making chicken salad for a sandwich. However, if you like large chunks of chicken, this product will disappoint you."
3,Smart Parts SP-8 Paintball Gun - Night Ops,"This is a pretty good scenario marker, but it is not very good if you want to use it against other tourny markers. You want to get an electronic hopper, i suggest either a halo b, or diablo agitator. Smart Parts id a great brand, but get an ion, and skip the body kit.It's your choice, you can go with a scenario marker, or you can get a perfomance marker. If you want scenario, go with the Tippmann A-5."
2,amazed,"I bought this book, because i'm a home baker who is trying to get a business going. So far the word of mouth has been great. I'm always trying to find new ideas, and I try to buy all the books I can on cakes. Well this one really amazed me. I found it hard to believe that this person is a professional. Her icing is all rough, her scale in decorations are wrong and her desings are, for lack of a better word...funky. I have to say that my cakes look more finished than hers, and I work from home. This book was amazing in that it opened my eyes and gave me hope to someday being a sought after cake designer."
4,One of my favorite picks,I chose this band on blind faith alone and it remains as one of my favorites to this day. This band shows that it deserves recognition with its unique sense of style. From bluesy riffs to contempory rock and jazzy songs this band stands out among the rest. Looking forward for the next releases by Poems for Laila
1,5 star reviews are questionable,I have spent an hour looking at hard drive reviews. I noticed that many of the raving reviews for Cavalry drives come from people that post raving reviews for multiple Cavalry drives on the same day. Let the buyer beware.
3,Not our favorite toy,"We bought this for our daughter when she was around 5-6 months old. She really loves the balls, but when we take them out of the toy and just put the toys in a laundry basket, she likes them even better. So now, the balls are all in an old laundry basket, the big stuffed toy is in the closet, and everyone is happy. Consider buying a cheap laundry basket and bunch of balls- it may save you some money!"
5,Great toy. My baby loves it.,The only think you might want to know that other people haven't mentioned is that the included balls are soft and tend to dent. they are not like the hard balls in a ball pit at chuck-e-cheese. I consider this a good thing as they are safer for babies or toddlers when they fall on them.Great Product.
2,Nothing special-big disapointment,"I waited along time for this one and was disapointed with the half-hearted writing, performances, and production. I much prefer their jazzier less oversimplified R&B styles. The new singer didn't do a thing for me as she is all attitude and less talent. I like to hear different vocalists, but the band doesn't help her much because of the dull songs and arrangements. There are three songs that are good: Boogie, I feel Right, and How we do This. Those songs have real grooves. The rest is filler. If you don't believe me read the reviews on Amazon UK."
4,Return of DA FUNK with a Fresh Soulful voice,"The Brand New Heavies return from a brief hiatus with a funky album featuring the sassy Nicole Russo which is an a welcome addition to their catalog. What I like about this cd for those of us who long for the days that they work with N'Dea again or even cherish ""Shelter"" which they recorded with Siedah, BNH didn't try to recreate those recordings. What they did do is take their classic funk leanings and added more hip hop and club influences which adds freshness to the new material. Nicole Russo is another welcome addition. Sounding like a cross between Anastacia and early Teena Marie, Nicole brings accross the sass that is needed to carry these songs. My favorite tracks are ""Feel Right"", ""Boogie"", ""What do you take me for"" & ""Waste my time"", the other tracks are cool too, mos def no filler on this cd. I say check it out, but listen to it as if you have never heard a BNH cd before, trust me you won't be disappointed!"
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD, too bad Nicole Russo is no longer with the band. Very upbeat, funky and fun to listen to!"
2,just kinda there,I dig the Brand New heavies&Finally got to hear this album recently&felt a let down because the trademark grooves&arrangements ain't there for me. this album doesn't really have that One song that I gotta hear over&over again. Boogie&I feel right are cool. the rest feels like filler. I hope they ain't trying to hard to appeal because this ain't the right step.
5,Great Book. Every premature infant should have one,Great Book. Records the milestones of the premature infant while in the hospital until six years of age. It is a keepsake album which contains precious memories for the parent of the newborn to record. Better than a regular baby book. Every preemie should have one!!
5,Good buy,"Needed an ashtray for my new car (as they dont come with them anymore) This one fits the cupholder perfectly and does the job. I like the auto snuffer on it to put out the cigs, it puts them out right away and kills all the lit ashes so I dont have to worry if it is out or not. Like the lights. They are not too bright - just enough. Easy to clean. I have nothing negative to say about it. Its about as great as an ashtray can be."
1,Total junk,"The box states that it has real vacuum action, but it doesn't. It doesn't pick up ANYTHING. I bought it for my 5-year-old so that she could vacuum her own rug. She always wants to try with my vac, but it's too heavy for her. I researched toy vacs that work and found these reviews and was impressed by one marked ""Dustee"". I don't know how she gets hers to pick up things, but ours won't even pick up a small, light piece of lint. My daughter and I are both EXTREMELY disappointed."
3,my son loves to vacuum,"My son loves to vacuum. He had another one that he loved to play with. When it broke, we ordered this. Day one, he dropped it (mind you from about a height of one foot) and the electrical lead dislodged so it no longer runs. He still plays with it but he cant' understand why it doesn't make noise anymore."
5,FUN Cleaning,This has been a big hit for Christmas for our daughter she has cleaned the carpet several times today...FUN FUN FUN!!!Great Gift!!!
2,Hard to push,"This toy was purchased for a vacationing little girl who has a different brand of play vacuum at home which she nearly sleeps with. This one was very hard for her to push - even on very low carpet, and caused her a great deal of frustration. She rarely played with it even the first two days of her 2 week visit. I'd seen a review stating it was cheaply made and thought, ""it's a toy - of course it's not going to be sturdy"" but I too was disappointed. It was certainly not worth the money."
5,Fun!,"My daughter loves this! We bought it for her 3rd birthday because she loves to help Momma clean the house. The only thing I was bummed out about was I thought it really picked up ""real"" things around the house! It came with play white pebbles that the hand held vac picks up. We haven't used them yet because I'm afraid they would be more trouble but maybe when she gets older. However, she loves to play with the vacuum cleaner and it's neat that the hand held vac is removable from the overall cleaner."
4,overall nice vacume,i purchased this vacume for my 3 yr old son. i shopped around trying to find a nice vacume and something that wasn't girly cause little boys like to play with stuff like this too. it is a little misleading because it doesn't suck that well but he still plays with is and enjoys it i would reccomend it to anyone
2,5 Minute Facelift Review,"This book does not describe targeted area exercises very well. The book has less than 80 pages and spends very many of them just talking about faces, general face massages, and make-up. If you're looking for a book to specifically work facial muscles to tone and 'lift' your face this is not it."
2,The least expensive for the information given.,"The book is not written well, but it is the least expensive book with the needed information I could find."
1,Terrible,"Terrible interface, annoying as heck, woefully inadequate customization over what it does, apparently impossible to completely uninstall. Avoid."
1,Do not buy this program !!!!!!,"Cybersitter appears to be poorly written. The only way we could get this program to allow child access to sites was to disable it altogether. Time restrictions did not work. It gives no messages to say that sights have been blocked.Cybersitter support helpdesk was at least accessible but they could not provide any useful help. No wonder, I work in IT and would be ashamed to support rubbish like this. Do a search on google for people unhappy with Cybersitter they're are plentyI uninstalled the program and on reboot it killed Windows, boot up system files were missingBeware............."
1,Junk!,"If I could, I would give this item ""0"" stars. I was not even able to load it on my computer, and the vendor would not give me a refund. They stated that ""downloadable"" items can not be refunded. Buyer beware! Technical support was absolutely NO help.I ended up downloading Net Nanny from the Contentwatch website, and it works great.DO NOT BUY CYBERSITTER!"
1,Bad CyberSitter,"I bought one and installed it on my kid's windows XP, but my kid can easily disable it even just with his ordinary ""User"" account/privilege. I am an IT professional, but I can not believe this product is so vulnerable! It shows one file is not accessible once got disabled by my kid. Now I am looking for other and better parental control s/w."
2,doesn't block foreign language sites,"doesn't block any foreign language sites (languages other than english). kids can easily figure this out, then you have no blocker at all."
3,ATP Harmonic Balancer,"I searched high and low for a replacement piece. I thought I was buying an American made part, but no ... this part is manufactured in India."
5,Buffered Aspirin 500/BX,Aspirin is almost at the level of a commodity. This purchaser looks at price and availability. This product delivered both as advertised. A good buy.
1,Don't believe everything you read - especially this book,"This book is shockingly inaccurate. I gave up reading it after finding that 2 of the first 6 articles were just factual nonsense:- ""Do the British Own America?"" is based entirely on the Drake Plate, which was shown to be a forgery in the 1970s.- ""A Civil War Story"" is a mythical story of the origin of taps, one debunked in the 19th century.Don't even think about reading this book unless you're willing to follow it up with further internet exploration to separate the facts from the fiction. Obviously the author wasn't."
2,"If you are going to write a book, check your facts","I just purchased this book less than an hour ago, but I'm already annoyed. If you are going to write a book about little known events and heroes, it would be helpful to, at the very minimum, correctly name the subjects of your book.There is an entire section devoted to the State of Franklin, and it's founder, John Sevier, who (we are told in this book) was nicknamed ""Nolichunky Jack."" Uh, no. He was known as NoliCHUCKY Jack, after the NoliCHUCKY River. I mean, come on. Nolichunky?I'm not even that interested in reading the rest of the book if an error that screamingly glaring is not caught by the author or publisher. It's like writing a book about Richard Nixon and calling him ""Tricky Rick"" throughout. Or calling Lighthorse Harry Lee, ""Lighthouse Harry Lee"".Argh!"
2,Some weak logic on the author's part,Ayres writes about the 1930's discovery of a plaque in California of seemingly probable origin that it was made by Sir Francis Drake in the 1500's. Fine but Ayers goes on to say that Great Britain could claim California as theirs on the grounds of this discovery? Hello? It would take an awful lot more than even an authentic buried plaque by one royal-paid buccaneer-type in the 16th century for GB to be able claim California as theirs back in the 1930's or even now.
2,Kinda boring,I had to read this book for ap us history and most of it was quite boring...few sparks hete and there but mostly tedious. Would recommend reading if founding brothers is other choice... Lol
1,Wait for the patch or pass on this,A greatly improved version of C3 but with one of the worst interfaces in the gaming world. I even purchased a new hard wired custom gaming mouse to make the game playable...without success.Bottom line is don't buy this game unless Sierra/Tilted Mill improves the interface.
1,Troublesome,"Very pretty, if you can keep it working long enough.Before you spend your money, I suggest you check out the official forums for the game. They're flooded with technical fault reports.The ""fixes"" often include suggestions to roll back drivers, turning off graphics features (!), reformatting the PC (!!) etc. I've personally made numerous configuration changes, on a well above spec machine, and the game still crashes at clearly defined points, making the game unplayable.The game simply does not run on all machines above the required minimum spec."
1,Complicating what had been simply brilliant,"As a fan of Caesar III I was VERY disappointed with this game. The only noticeable improvement from Caesar III was a slight tweak to the graphics. Short of that, everything else is downhill. The central flaw of this new installment is that the designers overly complicated things. Each building has a different size, each sector requires a different type of citizen and nothing can be easily monitored. To someone who enjoys planning a large city beforehand, Caesar IV is a nightmare. Example: adding throughout the map rugged terrain where nothing can be built turns the map into a very small building area, limiting what can and can't be built. Perhaps if I had not played Caesar III before I would be able to rate Caesar IV as decent, but as a follow-up, it does not live up to expectations."
3,Great!,Everything was perfect. Except of course for the San Antonio UPS...butthe game came vacuumed sealed and was shipped out on time.I would definitely order from this seller again.
3,Have not used much.,"I have not used this game much, so the review could go either way. I have tried the tutorial a couple of times and noticed the graphics were weak with white splotches. Of course maybe my system is not powerful enough to run this. Basically I have to give a 50/50 rating due to lack of use."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","I've played this game for a few days now, and I find it to be clumsy and difficult to work with. I really liked Caesar III, as I felt I could really get a strategic sense of what I was doing in a mission. This game feels just too big to get anything done. Certainly it could be said that the graphic improvements are legion, but does it improve the play of the game? For me no, it makes it worse.I would download the demo and try it for yourself before buying this game!"
1,Unable to play,"Apparently, this game does not play we have tried unsuccessfully to figure out why, it keeps saying that it needs the original disk installed. We supposedly bought a new game and not a copy. When trying to research it others have had the same problem..."
2,Rome keeps falling,"I would like to give you a review of the game, but I can't. I've barely gotten to building the second city and THE GAME KEEPS CRASHING ON ME!!! Be warned. I've never had trouble from a game like this before. What little I have got to play it, I agree with the annoyance of all the submenus and having to click several times before a building stays put. It makes me long for the simple days of Caesar III."
1,Won't load correctly,"I bought this with much excitement as I love the other Caesar games.My system exceeds the requirements of this game yet I cannot get the game to play with graphics. I called customer service and they told me to upgrade my video card. I have the top of the line Nvidia GE Force 4, but I stupidly listened and after four hours of work and a system restore later. I can still Not play the game."
1,Don't buy this!!,"I have had this game for just 2 days. After finally getting it loaded it is SO slow I just don't have the patience. It crashed a number of times and the graphics are really awful as well. I have spent many hours playing other games (Emperor, Ceasar I and II, Pharoah and Cleopatra, Zeus, etc.) and loved them. I am really disappointed but I am giving up on Ceasar IV."
4,good,ordered as a backup because older game cd was going bad. would recommend to anyone who has played Caeser III
2,Caesar III was more user friendly,"I don't have a lot of experiance with it yet, so things may improve over time. It was a lot easier to place roads and buildings in Caesar III. It was also easier to move around the map. One good thing is that there is a lot more variety of things to grow, manufacture and sell, though it makes managing things harder, but that's okay. One thing I don't like is that you need a trade port or depot for each city that you trade with, if there are four cities that you can trade with and they are all water routes, you need four ports, and they take up a lot of room.I'm sure that I will enjoy it more once I get used to everything."
4,Caesar IV,"This game is so much fun and the graphics are great. Only one problem, if your computer does not have the latest graphics card and a lot of memory the game will play extremely slow."
2,Controlling Nightmare,"the graphics are nice, but the 3-D views are hard to control with the right click panning. i end up just building from the top down view, still with dificulties rotating.but as mentioned, this game has horrible lag. even with 2GB of RAM and a decent CPU the game is too slow to pick up on second clicks or sliders."
3,Served its purpose,"Let me just begin by saying: this is the most cheaply made and ugliest belt I have ever seen in my life. I would never actually wear it with anything that I thought someone would take seriously. I bought this belt solely as part of a costume. I needed something cheap, white and something with silver embelishments for a Princess Leah costume for halloween. I didn't pay much for it and I am so glad! The belt was HUGE! But it served it's purpose and it may come in handy someday in the future for another costume or the same one. I can't really complain about it because I had the intention of only using it one time. You get what you pay for here."
4,catsup,It is nice to have something a bit different than the bottled grocery store catsup. This goes well on burgers and hot dogs.
5,Why Oh Why,"I bought this album in vinyl when it first came out, and was addicted from the opening notes of the first track. Why oh why is it not currently available in music stores? The fact that it's selling for a minimum $67.99 for a used copy should tell someone in the music business something. Re-release this classic!"
5,Classic Among all Classics,"From 73 to 78 my friends and i wore out a couple copys of this album, and then like most other people our attention swayed to other bands and styles of music, Then in the early 90's i began my search for Drippin'Wet, Which was not to be found anywhere,When record stores told me it was out of print it was truly a sad music day for me, Thank You Amazon for bringing back one of the greatest albums of all time.I never would have found it if not for you."
5,"If you heard the original vinyl, you must have this....","This is simply an exceptional live recording of one of the most underrated and most skilled bands around. If you ever get a chance to listen to Jimmy Hall live, don't miss it. If you want a facsimile of the live Jimmy Hall/Wet Willie experience, buy this CD.I heard this in college in 74, and this album was wonderful then. Times have changed, but the power and talent of this recording by Wet Willie hasn't. If you want to hear rock and roll as God intended it to be played, this is it."
3,Sodium Chloride 5% Opththalmic Solution,This product is ok but not as good as the original by Muro. It is much thicker and leaves a sticky residue for much too long.
4,Good for their intended purpose,"These drops are good for their intended purpose--reducing corneal edema. Typically I have to use these in the mornings to improve my vision after sleeping. The only reason I didn't give them a ""5"" is because they burn, but that's because of the salt content--and that's exactly why the product works. But, still, it would be nice if the burn could be avoided. However, the short period of discomfort is worth the improved vision."
4,sodium chloride 5% solution 15 mi,Works well for my cornea edema and at a much better price than the major brand.I have been using this for a few months now. I will buy again.
5,good product,"I use this as an alternative to a more expensive brand, and have been using it for more than five years. It works the same as the higher priced product which saves me some money."
3,Seems ok,"I got these drops upon the recommendation of my eye Dr., The one thing that concerns me is they sting when 1st put it in. One fellow user said they aren't suppose too,but I tried the name brand version of Muro 128 and they still sting, so I believe it's just me."
4,does the required job,"I have an eye disorder and the doctor prescribed this product. This is the generic version, and is quite a bit cheaper than the name brand. It performs in exactly the same manner."
5,Great Buy....,I have to buy this for my dog's eyes. I have to put them in 3 times a day. This tiny bottle is $24 DOLLARS in the drug store!! So this is a real bargain at this price since I buy more than one at a time.
2,ok but not what i need,"i ordered these hoping they would work like a portable heating pad to use when i'm in the car or when I need one that does not plug in. (that was how item was described on another website) these do not work well for that. do not like need to soak in water before use and when i tried microwaving them 1 square got too hot and melted, making a gross smell and a mess. the other barely got warm. will go buy a normal microwavable heating pad instead.might work better as cold packs."
1,ineffective,no fault to Amazon but I used this product EXACTLY as described and it didn't even keep a previously frozen product cold for an 8 hour period. (do not buy ~ ineffective)
3,reusable ice & heat pacs,"Price was fair, but not impressed works like any other ice pac they do remain hot for a couple of hours"
1,Worse than most,"I have to agree with the other reviewer of this item. This DVD is a dud. At least with other motorcycle documentary-style videos there is an evident theme, such as being at one of the major rallies and so forth.There is no evident theme to this video. As the other reviewer said, it's like someone took a video camera and just walked around some rather empty-looking custom bike shows. If you listen long enough to what people are saying on the video you may be able to figure out that these are loosely connected shots from one or more tours sponsored by Easy Rider magazine and that the video is highlighting some of their ""centerfold' bikes. But there is no narration or anything that really makes that connection for you.I don't know why they have those girls on the cover of the DVD. They are nowhere to be found (no are any others like them) on the DVD itself.Overall, a waste of time and money."
2,Created a welt under my dog's front leg,"I loved the idea of this harness because I had tried the muzzle type of gentle leader and my dog (lab) still pulled. But I noticed after using this harness for 2 weeks that my dog developed a raised and bleeding welt under his front leg (where the harness loops under his chest). As a result, I am back to a regular collar."
4,No More Pulling,I have a 5 month old lab puppy that pulled like crazy. This harness reduces pulling greatly. She has chewed on it a few times but it has held up very well. I would recommend.
3,Dog harness,Don't know if it was just me but couldn't tell if I got it on my ten pound rat terrier right.
3,"Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness, Medium/Large, Black/Silver",I got this product for a cross of a daschund\lab mix and because he has short legs (he can get his legs out) this product does not work as well with him as my other dog.
2,works when it works,"I got a petite for my 8.5 pound chihuahua, which is what the sizing guide recommended. It fits fine, but it is not possible to get it to look like the instructions. (too small?) That's not a big deal. But a big annoyance is the fact that any adjustments i make do not hold. They loosen after about 2 minutes, so i think i'm going to have to make the adjustments permanent by stitching the straps together. Also, I need to buy a new leash or hook because most hooks hang too low and she ends up tripping on the leash.But, it does work, and she no longer pulls."
5,Easy Walk Pet Harness,"My boisterous young black Labrador Retrievers walked as mannerly as I wanted them to, right from the start! I did not really believe the claim and am really happy that it works every time I walk my two dogs! I highly recommend this product ,Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness, purchased at Amazon."
3,Didn't wok for me,"This may be a great harness if your dog is small or better trained than mine. My dog just pulled and the harness just pulled to one side and no matter how tight I tightened it, it didn't stay in place."
3,Didn't Fit,"Good quality product, but could not get it to fit my dog as instructions directed. The next larger size would have been way too big for my Lab."
3,Its okay,"My dog really did not take to it. I was hoping it would help with pulling, but almost came off the dog."
4,Great,Great product. Stops pulling. Makes the walk more enjoyable. Thank you. I highly recommend this collar to anyone with a dog that pulls.
1,Just didn't work for my dog,"I tried several sizes and none seem to work well for my dog. He has a broad chest. He's a mini pin/chi mix so not sure what is going on, but it appears to fit but when we go on walks and he gets at all excited, tries to run, even go # 2, after it seems his legs get caught in the harness. It's hard to describe in words, but it didn't work for him."
3,"It works great, but...","For my beagle/lab mix I had to get a medium and and tighten the straps all the way. When the straps are actually tightened, the harness works great. My dog hardly pulls at all. The bad thing is that less than a minute after tightening the harness and walking with the minimum pulling, the harness is complete loose again. So, I have to tighten it yet again or the harness can't do its job. If they switched up materials so that this didn't happen, this harness would be incredible."
5,A wonderful tool,"I LOVE this harness. Even with the Gentle Leader head collar, my dog would pull. She does great with this harness. My arms are not sore after our walks! Its very important that you get the right size,because my other dog got welts under his legs.He needed a larger size. Arrived on time."
2,leash connection in wrong place for smaller dogs,"for a big dog, having the leash clip on in the front would be fine, but for my little terrier it means the leash's metal clip bangs around his chest and leg area. Get a harness like the Sporn, that clips on top. If you did buy this one though, put part of the leash you are meant to hold, through the harness's medal ring so that it's reversed and the metal clip is at the end you hold. I did that for a while, now I am just going to get a new harness, though because this harness is also kind of awkward to put on and off."
5,MIRACLE,"We have a very sweet, playful, energetic 70lb retriever. She was impossible on the leash. She does not pull at all anymore on this leash. When I talk the leash off for her run she is not in anyway hampered by the narness. I am quite happy with this leash."
4,Great for Dogs that Pull!,"I have a 70+ lbs labrador retriever mix dog and she pulls when she's on normal collar-leash. When I use Gentle Leader, it helped but she really doesn't like the Gentle Leader where it goes around her mouth-muzzle area. She always try to roll around on the grass area and try to paw her way out of it. When I put this Easy Walk Harness on her, it takes a while to really get the correct position as there are quite a number of adjustments to do. Amazingly, she doesn't even try to walk in front of me when she's on the Easy Walk Harness. I do think that she feels more comfortable wearing the harness than the leader. Also, people have said that it's safer as it's not wrapped around just her neck and head. I very much prefer the harness and I would recommend it as long as you get the fitting correctly!"
2,not fitting,"The right buckle keeps irritating my dog's right leg. We tried tightening the harness, and its still not quite right. We have a feeling that this harness was designed for more 'typical' shaped dogs. Ours is short but long. Our dog also slipped out of it a couple of times which was quite dangerous.We have tried fitting it to him a couple of times, adjusting everything we could and following instructions, and it just isn't quite right. We bought a medium based on the girth size, and maybe we should have gotten a small. But this would still not solve the problem of the right buckle that is so close to the leg. (We noticed that the instructions with the images never shows the right side of the dog's body too with the not-so well placed buckle.)"
4,Easy lead harness,"This easy lead harness is good for relatively disciplined dogs. The adjusters do come loose aka re-adjust as the dog pulls. Overall, good product for the price!"
3,premier easy walk dog harness,the harness is ok....i purchased the xl and found it to be too big so i went with the large and with the straps extended it's still not fitting correctly.it has rubbed under my dogs front leg and its irratated.
3,Easy Walk -- Not So Easy,"I have an English Springer Spaniel pup, 6 months old, who always pulls on her leash. I was getting so frustrated, even with obedience training. Because of all the good reviews on the Premier Easy Walk, I purchased this. I tried it for a week -- she would still try to pull, she flipped over once, and I was afraid of her leg being hurt. I was ready to pay $400 for a personal trainer just to teach my dog leash walking. My pup pulled no matter what. I finally mentioned my concern to my instructor, and she suggested the pincher collar. I first tried this on myself, and it didn't hurt -- just a sensation. The minute I put this on my pup, she started walking great -- she still ""tries"" to pull every once in a while, but the walks are so much more pleasant now. Lesson is -- each dog is different, and you have to keep trying until you have found the right item."
2,Great customer service... call if you aren't sure about fit.,"Our dog much prefers this harness to his other leads and we like it too. We had some problems with the fit but the customer service rep helped get the fit right over the phone and through email. Good company. FYI: As others say, avoid using when wet."
5,Great for Boxers,"I have 3 boxers and 3 easy walk harnesses. They are great. I have used them since my dogs were pups. They know when they go on that they can't pull on their leashes and no longer even try. I will say that they rub under the arms if they are used for an extended period of time, but I seem to mind that more than the dogs. It is great for training and great for walking with multiple dogs."
5,best $$ spent in a while,"I have 60# lab. She pulls big time. Like she chokes herself to death on walks. I got one of these when she was a pup, then I forgot and she grew out of it. Way cheaper here than store. I use to not want to walk her, then I got another one that fit her."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased two of these and both have already broken. If your dog will play in this or run through woods or do anything semi aggressive with this harness on it will fail. I had one of these a couple years ago that tore and had it restitched, thought it was just a bad one. However, the new one I got seriously only lasted a week. Look elsewhere if you plan on actually using this thing on anything over 20 pounds."
5,AWESOME!,"I love this harness! We have a 75 lb. yellow lab that loved to pull anytime you put him on a leash. Any walk I tried to take him on turned into a run as he pulled me down the road. The first time I put the Easy Walk Harness on, he walked perfect. NO pulling, no running. I have used this for about a month now walking him every other day with the same result. The harness does not rub him either like some reviews said. Love walking my dog now!"
3,"Works ok, could be better","In my experience, the effectiveness of this harness depends on the size of the dog. Hence the rating of only 3 stars. I have a 12 lb poodle/jack russel mix, and a 50+ lb beagle/pit mix. Both are rescues, so they were never taught leash manners (I'm assuming based on their behavior). This harness works great for my little 12 lb, and now she rarely requires any correction. It doesn't work as good for my 50 lb dog. She still manages to pull anyway, especially when she is overly excited. At that point its feel like I am trying to wrangle a stampeding bull. Still, it works slightly better than a regular leash and collar combo so I'll be using this until I find something better."
2,not that great,"The harness does help, but does not prevent dog pulling. You do not feel the pulling as much but my dog still pulls on the leash and tries to be ahead of me, he still does not ""heal"" at all. He does walk better with the harness, but if your dog is anxious and is determined to walk ahead, chase squirels etc, this will not do much to help you as you will still have to restrain htem."
2,Doesn't prevent pulling,"This didn't stop my dog from pulling, tugging like it says. I have a lab/pit mix, his chest is big, so maybe I got the wrong size, or needed an inbetween size, it rubbed the skin off his legs just like all the other reviews said it would, from now on I will not buy anything that has poor reviews."
2,Big Design Flaw,"I read one review saying it injured their dogs, but since the majority of the reviews were positive I ignored it. I was so excited at the prospect of a walk with out the possibility of getting yanked off my feet I threw caution to the wind. My dogs are both 42lbs a Blue Heeler and a Scottie mix they are extremely active and strong and love to run, I prefer to walk. After adjusting the harness according to the instructions we went for an hour walk. I thought they worked great however when we returned home I discovered they both had been rubbed bloody under the armpits and the Scotty mix on top of his back he has very thick fur so I was amazed. I made covers for the straps with faux sheepskin and after their wounds healed I tried again it's working but I wish I had paid attention to the other review."
4,Great harness for dogs who pull,"My dog always pull when I walk him, even after trying to teach him not to do so. Before I bought this harness, we had a regular collar, and he would choke himself on it basically, but still pulled. I felt horrible, so I got this harness. It really does work. It helps with the pulling, and just one tug is enough to make him stop.The only thing is, he once managed to chew through it while it was ON HIM. And once he managed to slip out of it when my dad walked him. I dont know how those incidents are even possible since it is a snug fit, but they did.But it is a great product and will help with pulling."
4,Easy Walk Harness - Medium,This is a good product for just about any dog. The only problem I have had with it is that I bought the wrong size for my dog. A high quality product.
2,Not the best harness but good for training,This is not the easiest harness to use. It doesn't stay on my dog too well. I use it under his regular harness or I put on a sweater on my dog so that the easy walk harness won't come off. I plan to use the easy walk harness short-term until my dog learns to walk with me instead of pulling ahead of me.
5,awesome,"we have bought and returned several of these because either the plastic hook was broken enroute or it just didnt fit. we finally found the right size for out overzealous cockapoo and it's working wonders. He's more mindful during his walks, and when he does pull, he has a quick reminder not too.a word of advice. Alot of people have complained that this leaves red welts on their dog's underarms. This happened to us to until we tightened the parts that go around his ribcage and slightly SLIGHTLY loosened the part that attaches to the leash. that way it's tugging, not tearing. It's worked wonders."
1,Horrible product!,"These are a good idea, but they just don't work. I got two of the same size (based on chest measurements) for for my 80lb and 50lb dogs. I was unable to adjust either of them to fit accurately. On one dog the breast piece was too loose and got in the way of her legs. On the other dog the girth piece would not go back far enough and caused pretty serious scrapes and burns in his armpits. They would work a lot better if they were like a regular harness with this tightening feature in the front, but they have no support or neck attachment so they just don't work. I returned them and got Haltis instead. I later learned that Halti makes a harness almost the same as these, but is has a neck strap! I am sure they work much better than this one based on how great the Haltis are compared to other halter brands."
2,worn out in 3 days,it is not strong enough for my GSD. He is 11 months and 80lbs. this harness do some work like preventing him to pull somehow. But it just worn out in 3 days. I will upload a photo and return it.
4,Makes walking nice again,"I brought home a year old boston terrier / pug mix and he was a pain to take on a walk- pulling, trying to eat birds, distracted by every moving thing. This harness really does work. It keeps him in-line and helps control him when he want to run off. He does whine almost the entire walk because we wants to run off but knows he can't. The harness is great because you don't have to work up to using it (unlike the gentle leader - which probably wouldn't have worked because of his snub nose anyway). I only gave it 4 stars because it's not really teaching him better habits- it just makes him more manageable. But, with two small kids my time is limited and I will take what I can get until I get a chance to train him properly. Don't leave it where they can get to it- they will chew it up."
3,Returning it,"My hubby and I thought that it was hard to figure out how to put it on the dog. Then we discovered we had it on wrong, the part where you attach the leash goes below their mouth, not on their back, like most harnesses do. My dog has a 19"" girth, but the medium is too big, it fits my pug good. A few times my yorkie mix walked out of the harness, but he seemed to like it otherwise. So I tried it on the pug, great fit, but he kept sitting down and refusing to walk, I had to take it off for the rest of the way home, then he walked fine with the leash attached to his collar. I liked that it had 2 quick release areas and it was easy to put on the dog, once you know how. I am going to get a harness with the leash D ring on the top and a smaller size for the yorkie mix."
2,Unsuitable for running,"My dog and I run between three and six miles a day. This harness would tear him apart if I used it! I just received it, and after putting it on him realized that I had made a mistake in ordering it. This harness fits terribly, the buckle of the under strap sits directly in his ""armpit"" area. It does work well for walking, my large lab hardly pulled at all, but taking him for more than a brief stroll while wearing this would certainly injure him."
2,Terrible!!,"My dog definitely did not like this product. There's not much else I can say except he would not walk in it and seemed extremely uncomfortable. I did return it, and would not recommend this for larger, stockier built dogs as no matter how it was adjusted, it did not work out."
4,Helps alot with pulling,"My sturdy little guy weights close to 30lbs. I still think of him as a small dog, but ordered a medium and it does works with everthing adjusted as small as it goes. I ordered a used one and could see no sign of use. It really does help with a lot of pulling on the leash. He doesn't seem to mind it unlike the head harness I tried first."
3,sizing is not right,"first time i've used this on my 4yr old dog, maybe thats the reason why he walks funny when i put this on him. The sizing is not correct as well. I chose medium (my dog has 22 size) but its way too big for him. i like the design though, maybe if used on a larger dog, this works better."
3,"Great, but not for our Dog","When we put this harness on our Beagle he became a completely different dog and he pulling stopped almost immediately...The only problem is that the way our beagle is built no matter how tight or loose we made the harness he would get out of it eventually (not on purpose). His doggie elbows would eventually come under the harness and then a leg would slip out. He never tried get out it, and he did like walking with it, but it happened often enough that we could not take a good walk with him...we are currently working with the Gentle Leader instead, it takes a lot of ""baiting"" (getting the dog used to wearing it with treats and practice) but we can tell that we will be much happier with that product.If this harness will fit your dog properly, I recommend it. If your dog gets out of it, I would switch to Gentle Leader, but that takes a lot more work."
1,hurt more than helped,"this did not reduce pulling. he just learned to pull sideways. Could not get a great fit, medium too small, large too big. Had to readjust every time I used it. Will not use again, dog hurt shoulder pulling sideways the last time i used it. Seemed to hurt him more than it helped."
4,Prevents pulling!,"This ""collar"" stopped our 45lb dog from pulling on the leash right away... he just knew. He is a pretty well behaved 9 month old but loves to say hi to other dogs and animals.This is far superior to using a choke collar as it doesn't pull at the dogs airway and neck. They also aren't motivated to pull against it because they get spun around rather than a collar they can lean to creating a game like tug of war while they are on the leash.It was a little hard to get the right fit at first because he likes to keep his head to the ground sniffing but its working well now that we adjusted it!"
2,really chafes his poor little pits,"Being that Farley is a Doberman..he's not very hairy. This really rubbed his little armpits on our first walk. I felt so bad when I saw how raw they got. I now cover that section with fuzzy socks so they don't chafe.Aside from that it works ok. He does still pull but at least he's controllable.Don't think I'd recommend for a non hairy breed and not sure it really works for serious pullers...but like I said, it does make them a bit more manageable."
3,Might be a great harness - I did not get the chance to use it !!,"It took me longer to read the instructions and fit the harness than it took my dog to chew through the chest part of the harness. I was unable to try it ONCE!!! I was very excited about receiving it, because I am unable to walk my girl, as she is an abused, rescued shepherd (70 lbs of muscle) who is extremely aggressive toward people and other dogs. I have pulled muscles trying to give her a good walk that will use up at least part of her never-ending energy! Anyway, I received the harness in the evening, and while fitting it to her and reading the instructions to ensure that I fitted it correctly, she chewed almost all the way through it. Huge disappointment for me. I will save up and purchase another - watch her VERY closely - and try this out. I will update this review, because if it works for my girl, it will work for many others and their very strong pets."
4,"Pretty Excellent, except for one thing..","This product works very well on my small sized yellow lab. We had been previously using the gentle leader but wanted another product since the leader tended to inhibit her breathing a bit since to be effective it needed wrapped around her snout. The easy walk harness works and prevents pulling just as well! The only problem I found was that the straps going beneath her arm pits tends to rub and gave her a sore on one side that would bleed after our jogs.Fast forward to a month or so later and she no longer gets sores from this product. I'm not sure if it's because she has grown accustomed to it, pulls less, or I have adjusted it to fit better."
2,Quality is questionable,"The harness works well. My extra-large dog stopped pulling immediately making walks more enjoyable for both of us. As mentioned is some of the other reviews, this product works great when the dog is pulling; not when you are trying to pull the dog in a certain direction. I had no issues with hair loss or rashes on my dog's underbelly due to this harness.The bad thing is the quality is not that good. The harness has started fraying near the ring that the leash attaches to. I have had the product for less than a month and am disappointed that very soon the fraying will get worse and I the harness then becomes unusable. Bad quality materials used for this."
2,easily escapable,"My beagle has improved a lot with leash training but still pulls like mad when on the scent. This harness worked well, discouraging most minor pulling. I was pleased - until she caught scent of a rabbit and escaped in two seconds. Also, the straps loosened while walking. For safety we will be using a combo harness/martingale collar and two leashes.Update: Nope, even with the inescapable collar this harness is just no good. Even mild pulling/jumping when she is excited and trying to get at a squirrel etc. results in the harness coming right off. I won't be using this any longer."
1,Ouch!,"After getting home from a long walk, I noticed a massive red line running across my dogs chest. Under her armpit was an awful area of swollen red leash burn. I'll be getting her a better harness before we do any more walks."
2,Better hope your dog isn't too smart,"I purchased 7 of these collars. Have put them on 4 so far and 2 are missing already so I put one on another dog and watched. They pull on the tightener part around the neck until it's loose and step right out of them. I thought they would be perfect for leading, but now I have to go out in my 2 acre dog pen and search for 2 of them. Just hope your dog likes it because it was really simple for them to loosen it up and take it off. And just a note, it was 2 different breeds that did it.UPDATE: I have none of these left. Please don't waste your money on these. At least one of seven dogs should of been able to wear this but NO! Every one of them they escaped out of and tore up."
2,Not for us,I did not like the leash clipping in the front of the chest. Amazons return policy is very good and easy.
2,Not for Bichons,After much time spent putting this on my puppy and taking it off for adjustments I tried taking her for a walk with this and the poor puppy couldn't walk right. The distance between the chest strap and the belly strap somehow wasn't long enough even with excessive adjustments and she didn't get a full range of motion from her front legs. I did try one of the anti-pull leashes from this same brand and found they worked much better. They have an attachment that goes around the puppy's nose and kind of turns her around when she pulls. I'd say buy that instead of this if you have a Bichon or similar type of dog.
2,walking harness,"I bought this as a recommendation from a dog trainer, unfortunately it really doesn't work well with my big dog. She is still able to pull me. I can see how it might work if you have a dog that isn't strong bodied or strong minded, but if yours is, this product really won't work. It may work after my dog is better trained but that kind of defeats the purpose behind buying it in the first place."
1,THE HARNESS IS HUGE AND IT COMES OUT OF THE DOG.,"I order two harness for my dogs, I dont like it because it comes off of his bodies, both are huge. Much larger than a regular size large."
5,Love it!,"This is the best purchase I have made for my dog. She used to pull so hard on the leash, but instantly stops with this harness... and she doesn't mind wearing it. Would definitely recommend."
2,Premier Small Dog Harness,"Premier ECO Easy Walk Dog Harness, Small/Medium, Fern GreenThis harness will not stay on my small dog. Her legs are too short and come out of the harness frequently. Her chest is too low to the ground for a front hook up.The Premier Harness for Medium-Large dogs works better but is not adjustable for my medium Lab mix. I make them work by turning them over but lose the control feature."
3,Good for a while,"I used this for about six months until recently switching to the Gentle Leader. My dog is an 11 month old, 42 lb. shepherd-lab mix that pulls steadily on the leash. Switching to this from a regular collar really improved her behavior on walks. Unfortunately she got used to it over time and after six months the harness was not nearly as effective. One thing that bothered me while we did use it was that it needed almost daily adjusting, especially around the martingale chest loop. It would just loosen up over the course of a walk."
2,Not Good for Active Dogs,"Pay atention to the fitting, the harness actually wrap around the front legs closely & unnaturally. My dog got very uncomfortable in activities, and I believe it's unsuitable for active dogs. Just imagine put something like this on human bady under arms and try do exercises."
1,Worthless Gimmick,"I tried this contraption with my 75 pound golden retriever while training him to heel at my side and I was thoroughly disappointed. It is somewhat restrictive even when not correcting the dog, so it was not ideal for long walks, and I found the corrective action of the device to be substantially less than the more traditional ""spiked"" corrective collars.I ultimately was much more satisfied with the combination of a traditional harness and a corrective collar for occassional corrections, while not fiddling with this thing for 3 miles."
5,This is the harness to get,"Experience: one weekPros: immediately, our dog walks perfectly and is happier than ever to go on walks with us.Cons: none.Overall: before finding the easy walk harness, we tried many other collars and harnesses but they all had their problems. The Gentle Leader was great, but our dog HATED wearing it and eventually chewed through the over-the-nose strap (thankfully, they will replace the strap for 1/2 the price of the Gentle leader). The easy walk harness is just as effective as the Gentle Leader, but without all of the heartache."
1,Fits wrong,"It rubs my dog a, pitbul, raw right behind her front legs. I bought it so it would take the stress off her neck but im going back to a collar this time at least 1.5inches to distribute the pressure off her neck."
5,At Last I can walk the Dog,"I had purchased this harness after trying a choke collar, a prong collar, a slip collar and a different harness. My dog will generally walk well after having been through obedience classes but if there is another dog, I always had to wrestle with him. With this harness, if he tries to leave my side, it automatically pulls him around to me without choking him. I love it and he seems happier as well. He is a muscular cattle dog mix and is very strong. I always walk him with this and it is a pleasure. Sizing was a little difficult as he has a wider chest than girth, so he was an in a between size. I did need to cut and sew a little to get the perfect fit. These are sold at Petsmart for twice the price. I always check Amazon before I purchase anything. Very glad I found it."
3,Solution to the chafing?,"I bought this harness for my lab mix. She's about 6 months old. This is a product that her trainer recommended for her pulling, and it made such a difference! BUT. It caused a little red rash under her legs in her little doggie 'armpits'. Needless to say, she was upset, and a bit uneasy with her usual harness after that. Our trainer suggested I sew fleece 'sleeves' to the straps. Has anyone done this?? Does it work? I'll gladly do it if it will work, but don't want to bother if it won't or if anyone knows of an easier solution. Like another reviewer, I had high hopes, and I really wanted this product to work!! Suggestions? It did fit correctly. The trainer sized it for her."
1,Harness wears down and breaks,This is the only harness available at my local pet supply store so I've been giving it a go despite its flaws. Like most of the other negative reviewers I agree that the harness only works for the first week and then a dog gets used to it and pulls again.But perhaps the biggest flaw is that the fabric ring band in front of the chest wears down and breaks apart within a few months if your dog is a real puller. I've had to buy the same lead three times since it kept breaking.My next harness will not be an Easy Walk harness for this reason alone.
3,Easy Walk dog harness,Harness was well made and easy to install. However our pup dismantled it with her teeth in one week. Our fault. We left it on when she was in the house.The lead did not stop the pulling by our 15 lb. Welsh Corgi.We have since purchased a Gentle Leader which virtually eliminated all pulling. We are much happier with the new lead and would rate it a 5.
2,Did not work,This harness did nothing to stop/reduce pulling. I know it worked for a lot of people based on comments here but I bought two for m two puppies and they still pull on walks
2,Size Chart Not Accurate,"I was really excited for this harness to arrive because I'd read so many great reviews about it. I measured my dog (a mixed breed) before placing the order according to the size chart on the packaging and found my dog could fit two possible sizes. After debating between the Med/Large and Large, I opted for the smaller size. When I put it on her, I found that after adjusting it as small as I could it was still too big. I ended up returning it, but I must say that I was really impressed with Amazon's return policy. (This was the first time I've had to return anything.) Just a couple of days after sending it back, I already had been refunded.If I decide to buy another one, I think I'm going to buy one from a store so I can make sure it fits her properly."
3,Some adjustment required,"Product was shipped as promised. The packaging was excellent, from both Amazon and the manufacturer.The instructions are well written and easy to follow.Be prepared to make several fittings and adjustments. The thumbnail image for the XL is not how the belly strap fits under the arm pits. Be sure to read the instructions thoroughly for proper fit.My large dog likes to sniff a lot while walking, with his head low to the ground. The harness will slide forward, pinching the arm pits and leaving slack on the chest strap. I have to readjust his harness several times during our walk.Overall I like the Easy Walk Harness and it does what it says: keeps your dog from pulling."
3,"Better, but still pulls","I have a Morkie that loves to tug at his leash. This helps, but not completely. It's tricky learning to put this contraption on, but the color coded straps make it easier, but not easy."
1,Bad Idea,"I got this for my dogs because they pull at times. I got it in the mail today. I did what the instruction said and the fitting correctly. I took them for a walk and when I got home and took the easy walker harness off, BOTH of my dogs were bleed under there front legs. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,This has changed my life!,I used to dread walking my pulling monster of a pitt bull. He is now walking at heel. I can't rave enough about this product. We can now go on peaceful walks.
1,Did NOT work for my beast.,"Well made and quite sturdy but had absolutely no effect on my 60 pound pup. He still pulled as if he was part ox, perhaps even more so since he was able to put the full power of his chest into the pull."
3,med too small,After owning Rotts & a Mastiff I thought my Belgium Malinois was medium only to discover I needed a large harness. EZ exchange and now SAM does not like it because he can not put his leash in his mouth and walk himself or pull me on my bicycle. But the product is sound and I like it better than most I have seen of the style.
4,Great for pulling dogs,I bought this harness for my 2nd dog and it's been great. We had been using the head collars but I preferred this as it allows for more control and the dogs don't sweat through the collar when we run. Great product. Would have given it 5 stars if the harness had a little more information about what size dogs it would fit.
4,A great harness,"We have a husky puppy who we can't seem to train to stop pulling. Harnesses that clip at his back make it worse. He was fine with a collar for a little while, but when he gets overly excited he's almost not manageable anymore now that he's getting big. This harness doesn't solve the problem completely (nothing will solve pulling totally other than consistent training), but this is definitely a tool that makes it much easier on me. If he pulls, it turns him so he'll be walking toward me. And because of that he doesn't pull as much since he doesn't get where he wants to go!"
3,Tough to get the right fit for a small dog (Japanese Chin),"I am using this for walking the dog, and it does help with the pulling. However, I had to call the company to exchange it for the next size up because although I bought the right size according to the weight standards listed, I could not get that ""T"" shape that was indicated in the instructions. I still can't. I have adjusted it and adjusted it and even in the photo on the box, the ""T"" shape they are describing isn't there. Since I don't have anything better to help with the pulling, and I don't want my little Japanese Chin to hurt his trachea from pulling, I will continue to use it. One other note: It does seem to be really hard on his underarm area, making it red and pulling on the fur. So I always immediately take off the harness after walking - and use the harness strictly for walking only."
2,Easy Walk Harness,"Nope, doesn't work, not for me anyway. I have an Aussie Shepherd. She's a great dog, well behaved, obedient, but when she's out for a walk, and there's another dog, or another animal, particularly squirrels, she just doesn't hear me! I was really hoping this would bring her under better control, but it doesn't. :-("
1,slowest shipping ever!!,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS COMPANY! Slowest shipping ever. I ordered my products over a week ago and when i tracked them with the tracking number provided they are still 2 days out. I needed these and i am still waiting. I will never buy from this company again. I foster for a rescue and train them to help them get adopted faster. I am always in need of these kind of items and i will not be purchasing from this company again if this is the way they handle their shipping.
5,Amazing harness,"I don't know what makes this harness work, but it turned walks with my large poodle from a tug-of-war battle to a delightful stroll. No more lunging at squirrels and cats, but she still is free to sniff and enjoy our walks. It's great!"
3,needs improvement,"This harness works well for redirecting your dog, but...it doesn't stay adjusted. The sliders on the front of the harness loosen every time the dog pulls, so it has to be continually re-adjusted. I would give this harness 5 stars if they would use a different type of adjustment clip that doesn't slide as easily."
3,Dog walking.,Ended up giving this to a friend. Our dog is very head strong and really did not want to walk with this on. The gentle lead is better for her.
3,Its ok,"I have a dog that loves to tug and pull. This harness doesn't really help in reducing how he pulls when on a leash, at least it does not chock the dog when he pulls. This harness is relatively easy to put on and remove."
3,"Good harness, but it slips off","The concept of this harness is great -- I love that it doesn't pull the dog's neck. However, a basic design flaw enables my chubby little bulldog to wiggle out of it when he wants to.We definitely have the right size--it is as tight as I feel comfortable making it. Yet, he only has to wiggle his front legs ""just right"" to get it off and run away. Thankfully, he doesn't do this very often, but it annoying when it happens."
1,Beware which vendor you purchase this from!!!!!,"I purchased the Premier Easy Walk Harness in a M/L based upon the fact that the M was too small and the L was too large and couldn't find the M/L at a local store. It was sent to me from Entirely Pets - the harness was too small even though the size chart on the side of the package stated that it should fit. When I called for a return authorization I was told that if you tried on the item then you could not return it. I am shocked - PetCo, PetSmart, all local pet suppliers do not have this policy. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ENTIRELY PETS - unbelievable that they will not return items. I asked how you can know if an item fits without trying it out and the gentleman was unable to answer my question. AVOID THIS COMPANY!"
3,bad material,"The concept of the leash works. My dogs do not pull when wearing it. However, the material is too rough on my two boxers. It rubs off their chest hair and leaves a terrible mark right in front across their chest. Maybe because they have short hair that it is more obvious. I have to stop using it to let their hair grow back. I hope it does. Anyone know if there is a different material or padded one?"
2,Hurt My Dog,"My English Mastiff pulls and goes after anything with four legs, and takes me along with her. I had high hopes about this harness for my big girl after it was recommended by a trainer. It was pretty hard to fit to her, but I finally got it just right (and the trainer checked the fit). After about a week of use I noticed that she had a large welt across her belly and had oozing open wounds under her front legs. Right where the harness rubbed on her. The pulling never really got any better with the harness, but I was able to get her under control when she went after things. The search continues..."
5,Terrific Harness,"This was purchased to replace one that had worn out from use by both this dog and an earlier one. Excellent product, controls the dog's pulling, and makes walking a pleasure."
3,the right size,"As a product, they don't give as much control as the GENTLE LEADERS (by the same company) and the HALTI'S (different company). This is why I didn't rate the product higher. It really just ""hobbles"" the dog, which annoys & distresses me, but THE DOGS DO NOT MIND AT ALL. Yes, they would work better if my dogs were better trained! Still, the products that go around the nose are really annoying to the dogs and are leaving marks where they sit on the nose by rubbing all the darker fur off. Yes they are sized properly, it just happens. I had bought the ""large"" and ordered the ""tweener"" size to see if they fit better. My dogs are Vizslas and they ALWAYS fall BETWEEN sizes M and L so I was pleased to find this option. These CLEARLY fit far better so I returned the large."
4,Great harness for the price!!,"So far my German Shepherd Puppy who is about 38 pounds is easy to walk now! He used to pull me all over the place when walking, now that I have this harness it makes our walks much more enjoyable. I'm very glad that I made this purchase."
3,"great tool, but poor quality","I had purchased this over the summer and it really worked. However, after 3 weeks of usage, I noticed that it's having tear left and right. I thought my dog nibbled on it. So, I purchased another one and after 2 weeks, it starts having tear again.I wished they could make the quality a little bit better for larger dogs."
5,Great Harness,My dog pulls minimally to not at all while walking with the Easy Walk Harness. The harness is much more pet friendly than a choke collar and it works better also.
3,Okay product,"After reading the reviews on this product I was very excited to get it home, expecting that it would completely change the way my dog walks. Unfortunately it did not work as well as I had hoped - my dog still pulls while in this harness and has managed to get his legs out of it when he gets really stubborn. I am still giving it 3 stars because I love that it doesn't put pressure on his neck so he doesn't choke himself, and when he wants to behave he walks beautifully in it - but don't think that it is going to completely transform your dog and stop all pulling."
3,"Well made harness, may not be best for strong pullers","First off I have no complaints about the quality of this item. It may work really well for smaller dogs or less powerful pullers. Really, I was amazed at how well it corrected my Labs pulling issues... at first. However, he is a strong puller and no matter how many different strap configurations I tried the strap would always ride up under his right leg. After a week of use he developed an open bleeding sore. I have returned the item hoping to find a better -pain free- solution to his pulling."
2,"Work Great, Except for the injuries","I was very happy with this harness for the first two walks (a little over an hour each). Then I noticed welts under her front legs where the chest strap wraps around. For the most part she didn't pull hard, but it was enough. We did have some trouble fitting her (she has a medium sized body with a large build), so that could be the issue. Any way, we had to take it back and are now trying a Halti harness."
3,"Worked first time, but has habit of slipping off.","This item worked the first time right out of the packaging, but it has a habit of slipping off and down to his hind legs when he jumps or takes off from the sitting position. My dog stopped tugging on the leash and actually walked next to me, so the harness does what it claims. It's just the poor design of the strap placements. The reason I think why this harness slips off is because the front chest strap is designed to be lose and only tightens together when your dog tugs or walks ahead of you. Since it's loose, it tends to hang down below his chest when he's in a sitting position. Then when he gets up or jumps forward, his legs sometimes slips through the low hanging chest strap and then the whole thing slips back to his hind legs. The few times this has happened I was afraid my dog was going to take off running, leaving me behind holding the leash attached to the harness and no dog."
3,Ehh not bad,"It's not a bad harness, I just don't find it doing exactly what the description says it does. It has made walks a little easier, but it's just hard to find a perfect harness because different dogs respond differently to different harnesses. Also it seems like after a few months of use my 60lb boxer/retriever has stretched the material just enough that it's becoming a bit looser, and tightening the harness is very difficult. But it deffinetly has slowed him down a bit, I just don't think the pulling will stop"
1,Poorly Constructed,"I have had the Easy Walk Harness for 7 months and it recently broke during a walk. The black plastic clip broke apart so you can no longer fasten the harness. That is truly poor construction.On the plus side, while it worked, the harness did do the job of stopping my dog from pulling. They just need to improve the quality of the materials.Would not recommend this."
5,wally likes it,"this harness makes walking my leash-puller a lot more pleasant. a little tricky to fasten/unfasten, but worth it. wish it were cuter, but this situation called for function over fashion."
3,I don't like it.,"I don't like how this works. Maybe it would work alright if your dog always pulls forward, but my dog pulls to the side a lot to go sniff something or chase a chipmunk. And when she pulls to the side, this harness basically pulls her two front legs out from under here. She has done multiple face plants because of this issue, so I'm done with trying to train with this product. I'll look into a head collar instead."
3,careful of fit,"I ordered two of these halters because I'm going camping, and one of my dogs could get lost if he breaks free of the collar. I read all the reviews, measured carefully, and ordered them. When they got here, I noticed that even after getting telephone assistance from the company on fitting them to my dog, they did not fit correctly. I have a border collie and a mix. I ordered med/large. Neither dog is considered large, but this size was too small to adjust for proper fit. Too bad, as they look very sturdy and well-made. I'm reverting back to my tightening the collars when we go for a walk. If the border collie gets off leash, there will be no problem, but I probably have the mix because he got away from a previous owner and was never found. I don't want to take that chance."
4,Works as described,"My dog has a hard time pulling with this harness and it does what I want. The only thing I don't like is that you have to keep tightening the loops. For some reason they don't hold very well. It won't come off him accidentally, but it will loosen up. Its constructed in a way so it won't easily pop off over his head, but I would like the clasps to stay tight once they are in place where I like them."
4,overall satisfied.,I like how easy it is to put on. My dogs accept it. They don't dislike it like the head harness. They do respond to it and don't drag on the end of the leash. The only thing is I am not sure of the fit. They are 50 and 60 pound; boxer and boxer mix. I purchased the Med/Lg size. Maybe they are just on the border of this one and the next size up.
5,Amazinh,"My Belgian Malinois is a bundle of energy anf walking her or letting her run fullout is the only way to tire her out. The problem was her constant pulling. She would choke herself trying to lead. The only time she didn't pull was when she was tired. I have another dog, Chow Retriever, and when walking them together, one arm was in front being pulled and the other was behind me because he wanted to slow down the pace. My agility trainer told me about the easy harness and let us try it out. OMG! I had a new dog. It worked immediately. We even went to a pet store thirty minutes later and she stayed beside me the entire time. Got lots of compliments. I bought another one for the other dog and now they both walk beside me. No pulling. A friend has a dog that they never walk because she chokes herself, so I let her try my harness and the same results immediately. It works so well that when I take my two dogs for a walk I stop by and get my friend's dog too. Three dogs walking beautifully together."
4,"Good leash, could be improved","This is the first leash that has stopped my dog from pulling; however, I have to re-tighten it every time I take her for a walk."
3,Mixed results,"This does help me control my 130lb Great Dane while we're walking, but since it chafes her so much I don't have the heart to use it. If you only take your dog for short walks this could work, but for me it was back to a regular collar because she was developing sores from using this harness."
1,Don't waste your money,"This harness doesn't control a dog any better than putting your lead on the front ring of a regular harness. Also, it allows the dog to escape."
2,A gimmick harness,"This is poorly designed. The materials are strong and it is a worthy harness, but it doesn't work as advertised. Nothing will keep your dog from pulling on you except good training and a lot of love.I returned this harness for a refund. The refund was prompt and no questions were asked about my credibility.I have replaced this harness with a leash, compassionate training, and firm but loving eye contact. My dog behaves very nicely now, but he is still a dog, and dogs do what dogs do when they get excited. Never expect a gadget to make your life easier. It takes work, time, and a lot of love to get your dog to behave the way you want him/her to."
1,Broken chest piece strap,The Premier Easy Walk Harness was received with the chest piece strap broken. Had to return the purchase as the harness was unuseable.
5,excellent harness & price,"My dog, a terrier, it a little draft horse when out for a leash walk and literally chokes himself pulling, and pulling. This harness solves not only the potentially damaged windpipe to the dog from pulling and straining on the collar, but also, literally turns the dog back toward me when out for a walk because of the unique design; the harness hook is located on the chest instead of the back so pulling, by the dog's own energy is redirected to back toward the owner and thus, turns the dog left or right, depending in the side you walk on. It truly works from day one, minute one. Pricing was less than brick & mortar pet stores."
5,This harness works.,The truth is that this harness does prevent the doggie from pulling. Now I can walk my two Westies without dislocating my shoulders.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"It did reduce the pulling, but by causing my dog pain and misery! After one long walk, this product rubbed my Lab's skin RAW behind her front legs. I gave her a break from the harness to let the irritation heal, rechecked the fit and even tried creating a pad to put over the bottom strap and buckle to protect from chafing... She came home from the next walk bleeding. I will not ever use this again.Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness, Large, Black/Silver"
5,Simple and Effective,I have been using a Gentle Leader for my dog (who really prefers to be off the leash running free) for several years. I needed an additional leash set up and chose to try the Easy Walk Harness after reading the reviews. My dog and I both love it. The color coded strap makes it easy to get on right. Our walks are more enjoyable and the mark on his nose from the gentle leader have gone away.
4,Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness,"Great product for the owners of young and eager dogs. I always use it when we go to town. My boxer is too friendly and likes to meet everyone she passes by. This harness saves me energy and time. However, don't leave it lying around, plastic locks are not tough enough."
2,Disappointing....,I have a 11 month old lab and purchased this on the advice of my vet.It was recommended over the pinch collar I use. It is a lot of work to use and I find the dog to drift more with it on...
1,Broke within 6 hours,I had this on my 10 month old German Shepherd Dog. She manage to rip the harness apart within the first six hours that the harness was put on her.
1,Simply Doesn't Work,This doesn't deter my dog from pulling. It doesn't even make him think twice. I don't get what all the hype is about; all these reviews must be fake.So I payed 15 bucks for something that at best will cut up my dogs underarms. Great.
2,Lasted 2 hours,"It didn't fit well on my 9 month old Husky, and he tore it to shreds starting on our walk. We went back to his regular collar and leash."
4,easy walk harness,"I bought this harness not to solve preoblems whan I walk my dog! I bought it to couple with the walky dog to go for a walk riding my bike. I own a 90 Lb. Alaskan Malamute that loves to run, it was impossible for me walk her holding the leash while riding my bike, she is too strong and she pulls me out of balance! This harness works perfecly, my dog follom me and she cannot pull! WE enjoy nice bike riding togheter!"
4,works great and low price!,My big dog use to pull me at every walk but now he stops immediatly when I do. I don't feel like it hurts him as much as the neck collar and he acts like he doesn't even know its there.This strap is a life saver and I highly recommend it.
3,My 90 lb lab got loose,Not sure why this didn't work for me. He still pulled and one time he was pulling at seeing another dog and actually got loose and out of the harness. This was scary because I had no control of him. I tried the halte- the one that goes over the face and that seemed to work better- although he did not like it at all.
4,"Works well, but could use tougher material","I purchased this harness for my dog (lower end of medium size). It's a little tricky to get on the first few times, but easy enough to learn.The harness works as described. My dog usually pulls strongly against a leash attached to his collar, but turned into a perfect gentleman with the harness.The only problem I encountered with this harness was that my dog got the chest strap between his teeth and chewed through it in about 10 minutes. I replaced it with a short length of plastic coated cable that he won't be able to chew through.This harness would be perfect if the parts that were easily accessible to sharp, little teeth were made out of a tougher material."
3,Didn't deter our muscular bulldog,"This deterred our bulldog puppy from pulling for a few months, but once she started to grow in size... this did nothing to prevent pulling. In fact, I think she's apt to pull even more with harnesses. She would even pull backwards instead of forwards at times. She is 65 lbs now and we've since switched to a pinch collar which does wonders.I think it might be enough to deter a less muscular dog..."
4,"This seems to work, yes, it does work.","Our beautiful Pup Doggie......Fawn, is very strong, and when she pulls....you go with her.However, now that we purchased this Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness, the problem seems to be solved.It doesn't hurt her if you do it correctly. Meaning, don't pull on the leash or force the dog. It requires understanding, gentleness, and PATIENCE ! ! And when the dog understands what it is that you want, then the ""BATTLE"" is over.This ""Halter"" does the job. It's a Training Device. And it really works if it's done correctly. If you love your dog, then you'll get it right, with patience."
3,"Product is well made, fit an issue.","We purchased this for a 70lb Lab. We can't make the adjustments so the harness does not cut into the dogs legs. We have to be careful how long we walk her. From a control standpoint, it has eliminated the pulling."
1,"Premier Easy Walk Pet Harness, Large, Black",This harness actually cut the underarm of my dog's leg. The nylon straps have sharp barbs on it and it digs into the skin until they start bleeding. Very upset with this MFG and have returned the product.
1,not happy with it,"Its does stop the pulling but I can't use this harness because it hurts my APBT. His poor little armpits are scabbed up because of this product, and it wasnt even fit too tight for it to hurt him like that. I returned it after 1 try."
3,"not bad, but not perfect","I have owned three of these, upsizing as my dog grew. I agree with the other reviewers and hope the manufacturer pays attention. I do not plan to buy it again until the design is improved.The PROS:1) It does help with pulling.2) It is easy to put on.3) It comes in lots of sizes and colors.The CONS:1) The underside rubs the dog's ""armpits.""2) The sternum strap loosens up during every single walk and you constantly have to re-tighten it.3) If you leave the harness on before or after the walk, the dog can easily chew through the sternum strap. (Happened a lot with us.)"
1,"Did not fit well, chafed under front legs","As some people mentioned, the fit did not work for my dog. I have a small Beagle and she had grown out of her small puppy harness which was this same model (which seemed to work fine). I purchased the next size up and it fit well in terms of size and through my experience with the previous harness, it was mounted properly on her. As I took her on our usual jog, I noticed her legs didn't have a full range of motion. I immediately shortened our jog as I was concerned with the harness. We got home and I noticed the harness and completely chafed her skin raw under her front legs. This may fit better on your dog but it did not fit well on my Beagle. Returned the harness immediately for a better product."
1,Premier Easy Walk Harness,"Premier Easy Walk Harness is a great concept, but beware of the belly strap and it's connections which will rub off the fur from the dog's ""arm pit"" area, causing the dog to bleed. My partner and I have a male Pointer/Lab mix approximately 65 pounds, and a female white Shepard mix approximately 45 pounds. Both harnesses are being returned stained with our dogs blood after only two days of use. We followed the directions and tightened the harnesses pursuant to Premier's website instructions [...]. We might re-consider their product if the belly strap and it's connection points were heavily padded to prevent this extreme chaffing. We read the reviews and similar experiences other dog owners shared before we purchased the harnesses. Now we feel that dog owners considering the Premier Easy Walk Harness need to know about this damaging harness."
5,makes walking a breeze,The is an amazing product! Makes walking an enjoyable fun experience for our dog and for us. Highly recommend them.
4,great product,"This is a great product.Pros: It definately stops my dogs from pulling without choking them. Until now the only thing that would stop my 110 lb. american bulldog from pulling was a pinch collar. I was happy to see that the easy walk harness works for him. No more 'dirty looks' from other people walking. This harness has made training our 10 month old amstaff a breeze. No more pulling and choking, and it has made it easier to control her 'zig zaggin' while walking. Really easy to put on our dogs. Once it's adjusted, slide over the head and clip the belly strap and your ready to go.Cons: I'm not sure it fits as well on dogs with big chests (my bully breeds). Our Amstaff: Chest strap is adjusted all the way out while the belly strap is only 1/4 way out. Next size up, belly strap too big. She's still growing, we'll have to wait and see. It works for now."
3,works well until the dog flips out,"This product worked the second I put it on my 45 pound Carolina dog. She knew not to pull or else she wouldnt be able to walk normally. But then..maybe because my dog is so damn rebellious or because she likes to see me pulling my hair out from her antics, she decided it would be a great idea to act like a sled dog and pull me down the street while wearing her harness, despite the fact it squeezes her front legs together. So after a day of use, my puppy was able to rip the front strap in half from the insane amount of pressure she used to pull me around like a rag doll. i think if you have a normal puppy and not one who can be possessed by satan like mine, then this is a great harness. I think a dog that is so headstrong, impervious to pain, and obsessed with working her way up the pecking order, like mine, should use something else."
3,Not for every dog,"Although very well made, this was not the correct solution for our standard poodle. He still pulled with this harness, perhaps even more than with a standard collar. For him the best collar was the Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar. With the Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar he is like a different dog. As soon as we put it on he knows he is to be on his best behavior. No pulling, no walking in front of us. Perfect."
3,Sizing is large and rides low,"I bought this harness for my American Eskimo dog who has a girth of 21-inches, and it is just too big for him. If adjusting the straps to the fullest, my dog can still get his chin under the front strap. Also, the straps hit him across his shoulders instead of above them, so it rubs him as he walks. Maybe the smaller size will ride higher on him, but I've noticed that even on the package, the straps go across the pictured Labrador's shoulders.Otherwise, the construction seems very good, and the front lead is a great idea. I will buy the smaller size and hope for the best."
2,Too Complicated for Everyday Use,"I had high hopes for this harness because my dog takes off like he's a greyhound shooting out of the starting gate when we go for walks. However, after all of us fiddled with it, read the instructions and tried to adjust it for our dog, we agreed it was too cumbersome and probably none of us would use it. Maybe we just didn't figure it out correctly because the concept seems good and others seem to rave about it."
4,"Makes a walk in the park...well, a walk in the park","The tweener is just the right size for my standard poodle. Although nothing seems to control the dogs passion for pulling in chase of all the spring wildlife, the rest of the year, this works like a charm to civilize my puppy and encourage her to walk by my side."
4,Good Harness,"Good harness, works as expected, a little difficult to get exact fit on dog, but then he's a husky and the hair makes it more difficult. Does a good job of keeping him from pulling too hard.Glad we bought it."
4,American cocker spaniel owner,"this harness feels a little big for my spaniel, even though she is the medium size dog. All the straps are already on their min, but the whole thing seems to move all over the place. Overall it works, I don't know how comfortable it is, I can tell for sure she doesn't want to run along the bicycle wearing it.The harness served it's purpose and the dog stopped pulling immediately."
5,Highly recommended!,"First of all, Amazon probably has the lowest price for the easy walk harness. In most pet stores, they are around $30 or more. I wish there were more color options on Amazon, but at the great price, I cannot complain.This is my fourth easy walk harness purchase. I first purchased one by recommendation from my pet trainer because my dog would pull so much, and her collar would end up choking her. My dog was around 40lbs, and had a Medium harness then. Now she is around 53lbs and wears a Large. I highly recommend this to all dog owners who have trouble with their dogs pulling.Of course this harness does not magically make your dog stop pulling. It is an aid to help train your dog to not pull. I have been using this harness for almost 1 1/2 years with my dog. When I run into other dog owners on my walks/runs, they ask me how my dog is so obedient, or why my harness looks like it is not put on correctly- I tell them about the easy walk harness."
3,"It works, WELTS and all...","I would give it 2.5 stars if I could, but I'll let Amazon round it up to 3, since they don't do .5s in the ratings. I wanted to really like this item and even ignored some of that bad reviews. Like some of the other reviews, my dog got welts under her arms where the harness cradled her chest. She didn't pull too much, but I just didn't like the fact that she had these welts on her. I did check a few times to make sure that it wasn't too tight on her. It works, but don't be surprised if your dog gets welts, since the harness isn't made of smooth material."
1,Couldn't even try this product,"I was looking for a good, front clip harness to help train our little field bred English Springer Spaniel to stop pulling during walks. This looked like a great product online so I ordered it. I never got a chance to even try it - the plastic side release buckles were impossilbe for either my husband or I to open (and no, we are not invalids or weaklings). The only way the buckles opened was to use a pliers instead of our fingers to compress the little side tabs that opens the buckle. This is a serious product defect. Needless to say I immediately returned the harness and ordered something else."
1,Not for my Yorkies,"My two Yorkies would literally jump out of this harness. When they would lunge on their leashes, the clip on the front would make them do somersaults - not something that is pleasant to see. Hopefully it works better on other dogs."
1,Not so easy to use,The harness was not easy to use and it did not prevent him from pulling. I returned it to Entirely Pets though they delayed on getting me my refund back after 2 months. I would go with another vendor and perhaps the head collar instead of the harness.
1,Does NOT hold the fit,"This harness did not hold the adjusted fit position for one walk. We immediately turned back and switched to his old harness. The metal adjustment rings easily slide and there is really nothing from preventing the harness to reach its largest size. I guess you could sew it once properly fitted. Granted harnesses slip in their adjustment, but they should at least keep the adjustment for a block."
5,Best harness ever!,"I have a 8 month old female boxer/pit mix. She was becoming really hard to walk with all the tugging and pulling. At 65lbs and all muscle I didn't stand a chance and walks were not fun anymore. I had bought other no pull harnesses in the past for other dogs with not much luck. They always had the leash ring at the top. But I took a chance and I am so glad I did. This has made our walk fun again. It does take some doing to get it adjusted just right. She has a big barrel chest and a smaller waist but a large did fit with alot of adjusting.Also she can get out of the harness in the car and while not walking so just a bit of a safety warning. It works like a dream while walking her. Best harness ever purchased for walking, just don't think you can use it to tie them out or anything like that."
5,Great harness!,"I have 2 dogs - a 2 yr old lab/pitt mix and a 8 month german shepherd mix puppy. The lab/pitt mix usually walks without pulling but will occasionally lunge while on leash towards squirrels or new dogs. I like that this harness clips in the front, so that when she lunges and I pull - it completely pivots her body to face me - thus ending the engagement. While this harness doesn't stop the pulling quite as well as the gentle leader head halter, I feel it is safer for a dog like mine that may lunge. The puppy is still learning not to pull while on a walk and this harness helps me keep him under control without applying too much pressure to his neck/head. Overall, the halter makes me feel more secure and in control while walking my dogs, as each are 50+ lbs and quite energetic. One con - I measured the girth and weight of my dog and she fell in the overlapping region between the medium and large harnesses. The large is too big and will not fit properly."
1,Completely rubbed off my dog's hair,"Dog:Toy PoodleHarness:Small Red Easy WalkNegative:-Rubbed off hair on the upper backside of her front legs (armpits I suppose, as everyone else wrote) ... which means it is causing too much friction in that area.-Sometimes have trouble opening the teeny-tiny buckle, I'm lucky my fingers are small, otherwise I'd never get it open...Positive:-Wow, she went from dragging me across town to barely pulling at all...-I did like that it doesn't involve any pressure on the neck/throat, as toy dogs are prone to tracheal collapse.Conclusion:-Sacrificing her comfort for my own? I am unable to let her suffer so she can stop annoyingly pulling. I hope the pet store will take this back on the grounds of defective or unsafe... hey, if there was a toy out there that caused little children to lose their hair, there would be a recall, a segment on the news at night, and some lawsuits..."
1,Easy Walk Harness,Plastic snap broke in 2 months. We didn't realize it right away with our Terrier who like to chase things! Luckily we were in a park and not walking around Chicago where she may have run into traffic.Don't buy!!!
3,"Excellent design for ""tuggy"" dogs, but material is not strong","We have 2 tuggers, about 60 lbs each, with strong chests. We have tried everything, including (but not limited to): harnesses with leash attachments; on the back instead of chest; gentle leader; the Cesar Milan thing; dozens of training collars; etc.One of our dogs trained within days using this harness. The other dog, who is always a bit slower to learn, still tugs a bit, but when he does, it is not with as much force. He seems to be finally getting it. And when he pulls, I'm happy it is from his chest and not his throat.The only problem is that the material was too weak for one of our dogs, and the harness ripped the very first time he was wearing it.The good news: the same harness in the reflective fabric is much sturdier. I highly recommend that one."
1,Not a good idea,The way this item is constructed makes it difficlt for the dog to walk properly.Even if its tight he kept tripping on himself while wearing it.Im sending it back and getting a regular harness
3,Easy Walk Harness,"This harness definitely stopped both my dogs from pulling, but it does that by squeezing their front legs together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and is definitely better than pulling at their necks and choking them.I think I had it fit correctly, but the reason that I took away two stars is that this rubbed both my long haired Golden and my short haired Dobie mix raw in their armpits. The harnesses were used for running with the dogs, and they may have just been on too tight, but I stopped using them after these rashes developed. I still prefer this company's Gentle Leader, which is a head collar. It stops pulling just as well as the Easy Walk."
2,Sadly it didn't work - and then he ate it!,"I've had the other easy walk head harness so I thought this would help with the lunging and jumping. Regardless of how I adjusted it, it really didn't work. It just sort of pulled to the side. But it was easy to put on and the pup seemed comfortable enough. That is until he was annoyed at being hooked up at our lake cabin for TWO MINUTES and ate it off himself while I was inside grabbing a drink. So if your dog is a chewer - never leave him alone with this one!"
3,"Sizing is way off; if you can get it to fit, it works great","The width of the straps on this is tiny. It's for a very very small dog. It's like the width of cat leashes. It says it would fit up to 20"" but it doesn't.The medium also has sizing issues--it says as small as 20"" and it is too big. Very annoying! My dog is sort of compact and the area with the martingale loop is too long--I can't get it small enough. The girth around her chest is fine and will adjust as needed--it's the front that's the problem.If you can get it to fit (I can, at the very smallest setting in the front, but then it starts slipping as we walk), it works great."
