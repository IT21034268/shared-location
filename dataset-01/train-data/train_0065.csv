2,STP Shangri-La,This albumn is a far distant relative from the Core albumn. I am not as impressed whith where STP has gone but more where they started. I will always rate Core as #1.
2,Kind of disappointed,"I'm struggling to figure out which album the rest of the people have listened to? I read the ""critics"" reviews and expected some cool, trippy, mellow songs and some rock songs...I even heard reference to Bossa Nova music? I totally didn't hear that. Maybe I'm a throwback looking for something in particular but I loved all the other albums. I have to listen to it a bunch more times...but if you're looking for instant gratification, this album won't deliver. Maybe that's a good thing?"
2,Going going gone,STP has went down hill in the past few years. The first three albums are their best. The last two were decent with some good songs.
2,Easy to See Why It's Their Last Album,"I can't give this album one star because it isn't hideous... but its not good either. No wonder they broke up after this ""effort."" Bland, disjointed, and not at all in their character, this STP finale was a huge disappointment for me.Their pinnacle was 1994's ""Purple"" (album number two) followed by ""Tiny Music..."" then ""Core.""""No.4"" wasn't bad but hardly up to the first three they did.As for this stinker, as much as I love this band, I have to say: ""let it go."""
2,stone temple who?,"As a diehard stp fan, I must admit that this album should have never been released, or even recorded. This is the worst music that stp could have written, though one and the only bright spot on the cd is the opener Dumd Love. And no they will never make another Core or Purple but they have the talent to write songs that are not a disgrace to the fans such as Shangri-La."
1,Tasteless cd,"While it is a solid debut, ladeeda is not as engaging as Core. S.T.P. plays solid, album metal cuts here. However, there are some memorable moments. The Deleo-penned ""Coma,"" which is one of S.T.P.'s greatest songs, and Scott's ""Regeneration."" The most prominent feature of this album is a young guitarist named Rob, whose arena-sized guitar punch owes much to Backstreet Boys, Evanesence, and others. There is less about drugs and gloom on this album, except for the closing track, the collectively-penned ""Long Way Home,"" which chronicles (in a somewhat humorous/pathetic way) the life story of a heroin addict (Weiland.)"
1,Not their best attempt at anything..........................,"I am so sick of you 12 year olds writing about how much this kind of music rocks. This is 'N Sync with a guitar. Honest to God. It's only 40 minutes long, jesus! Some kid told me, when I confronted him about that, that ""well, lots of the beatles albums were only 30-40 minutes long"" well duh. back then they had VINYL. VINYL doesn't hold much more than 40 minutes of music. What's Linkin park's excuse? Oh that's right, they aren't musicians, they're deep fried pre-packaged music industry nonsense."
1,Couldn't give it away,"It is a shameful day when one of the fine bands of the 90's sells out to boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and Hanson. When I first purchased this album I was in complete confidence that this would provide many hours of enjoyment and in this confidence my friend was also excited about this find. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was marriage, but this, this is a close second. As soon as we bought the album it went straight into the cd player. 30 seconds was all it took. 30 seconds per song, and it was done. There is no rocking on this album. My friend is still shell shocked from this horrid, grotesque, disgusting, hell I don't know, whatever this garbage is, don't buy it. You will be ashamed of yourself, and the fact that you were ever a fan in the first place."
1,This is why you shouldn't marry and have 2 kids,"SW, after going to jail and releasing two sub-par records (NO4 and this one), has so much nerve to marry and father two kids, when because of the commercial failure of both, is going to find it a challenge to support his out-of-control, multiplying-like-rabbits family. There are heavy reasons this coaster of a cd hasn't even sold past gold status: because it's a pain. THat's why. Every song gets worse as you listen to more on the track list. You'd think it wouldn't be possible, cause the chances of one being good would neutralize all of 'em being horrible, but it's not to be. This is so bad that if STP back in '92-'96 would have heard of what nightmare they'd turn into, they would commit suicide; or at least would beat up their future degenerated versions."
5,Wonderful! Purple Days Are Back!!,"With reverential songs like A Song for Sleeping, and pure power in the brief Hollywood B**** STP is obviously back and just as good as ever. No. 4 had little popularity, but I attribute that to the fact Weiland was in jail and unable to promote that gem. The mansion effect worked for RHCP, and it worked again for STP. Buy It! Consume, consume, consume..."
5,Whether or not you like STP..........GET THIS CD!!,"This will be short and sweet. Picked it up today.....listened to it once........STP's best album yet.......????....YES, better than Purple!"
3,La Dee Da is correct!,"STP is back once again, with a newly clean and sober Scott Weiland fronting the band for their fifth album. Shangri-La-Dee-Da is a departure from their previous albums. The new album does not have any songs with that catchy pop melody we all love. STP recaptures the edge they had with their debut album with songs like ""Dumb Love"" and ""Coma."" ""Days of the Week"" was their first radio release off the album because it's the only one that's really radio friendly. If you're expecting to hear classic STP then you might be a little disappointed. If you like that the band is exploring new avenues of musical expression then you ought to give this album a listen."
5,Great Rock Album,Shangri-La Dee Da may be STP's finest work. Great lyrics combined with great music. It has something for everyone. The booklet that comes with it is very cool too. Buy Shangri-La Dee Da today!
1,Maybe Dave Coutts wants his old job back!,"Tool is the best band nowadays, for the one, sorely sensitive reason that stp are failures: as stp's career has furthered itself, their albums have died. Tool, on the other hand, only continue to get better with each release. STP NEEDS to stand to take a lesson from Tool's page, and stop putting out fearsomely abnormal pop garbage. To every mistaught, five-star reviewer: you should employ excessively MORE virtuous standards, like the Tool analogy, in your spitefully self-righteous, hidden agenda reviews, where you fake that stp's shangri-la is buyable."
2,Next Please...,"Okay lads, your lead singer happens to have one of the best voices ever to grace a recording studio, and the family connection are capable of writing EXCELLENT songs (this is not that common across the rock music board, otherwise we'd all be stony broke!)and you have FOUR brilliant albums behind you; the previous (NO. 4) album is hugely underrated in my opinion, I love every morsel! (Mind you Tiny Music, Purple and Core have the same exquisite taste...) SO!!! For the benefit of Mr. Kite and all the rest of us: please take your time with the next one, and regain a bit of perspective! By the way, the noises you make still sound great, but this aside - the less said about Shangri-La Dee Da the better.(Too Cool Queenie had potential!). Finish the bloody songs off!! Signed Still A Fan"
1,Let's blow some bubbles,"""Shangri-La Dee Da"" marks most likely a new era in the world of STP. The bubblegum era.Lost is the edge that STP has always seemed to maintain in their music. Be it glam, opiated, or just straight up rock n roll, STP has always kept it real. The music has always magically complemented the voice of Scott Weiland, where, of course, lies the explanation of why this release is a dud.I, like all other fans, am happy that Scott is off the smack. I'm happy that he is married with a new kid. Unfortunately, this isn't the same Scott Weiland that was a part of the previous four releases. His pain is gone for the time being. Perhaps his artistic edge has gone with it as well.True STP fans, or should I say, fans of the old STP, we have seen an era come and go. Let's just hope Scott and Co. don't ruin it too much."
1,"Failed, misjudged, desperate attempt at profoundness","I don't believe stp will ever live up to the standard core fanatics demand, but on this CD they barely manage a coherent standard at all. 'Hello, its late' takes what I can only call an 'orchestral riff' and repeats it for 11 minutes. 'days of the week' is catchy and genuinely swings, but is undercut by offensively dull 2-minute long drum solos. Half of these tunes make no impact whatsoever, except to suggest weiland wants to be a singer in a garage punk band. stp, we don't want you to be Johnny Rotten, we want frilly multi-instrument emotionally direct concise tunes. (Like what you did before this mess') I'm always a fan, but this CD is a career-killer. Only 'Long way Home' works well, and you can get that on the far better 'internet'."
2,STP goes out with a whimper,"Possibly the last album from Stone Temple Pilots, 2001's ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" is undoubtadly the worst album from the band. Most of the tracks featured here either sound too poppy or too generic, and the lyrics (""there's so much God can teach you..."") are trite and uninspired. Scott Weiland's voice sounds great though; when this album was being recorded he was cleaned up (for a little while anyway) and his voice greatly benefited. As for the rest of the band though, I can't understand what happened to them here. ""Coma"" and ""Hollywood Bitch"" are standout tracks, but that's about it. All in all, if your a new fan of STP, check out ""Core"" or the brilliant ""Purple"" before listening to this disappointment."
2,"Their first was bad, their last was bad.","Core (Stone Temple Pilots) first album is a terrible album and so is their last ""Sheeran Laa dee Da""What a lame effort, their are about 2 or 3 decent tracks on this albumthe rest is throw away filler.""Too Cool Queenie"" and ""Dumb Love"" (the first track) are the only stand out tracks.As for ""Days of the week"" being the well known single of the album, all I can sday is that is the worst song I have heard by the Stone Temple Pilots."
4,Hypnotically pleasing,"Well, I consider myself to be a pretty ""with-it"" kind of dude, and that's why I was surprised when this humdinger of a rock & roll album passed me by like a ship in the night. It used to be that I knew everything about STP, but it seems like you never really hear about them anymore, except when Weiland is in trouble with the law.Anyhoo, STP definitely deliver the goods on ""Shangri-La Dee Da,"" and that's an understatement. I especially like the ""hypnotic"" sounds I hear on some of these songs, be they slow or fast. And, it's hard to deny the sheer melody these dudes churn out with each album, on almost every song. Weiland's versatile vocals, and Dean Deleos' superb fretwork, add to the growing of this band.Definitely check it out..."
5,Yet Another Masterpiece from the Stone Temple Pilots,"The Stone Temple Pilots prove again that they are one of the most diverse and amazing rock groups with their latest release Shangri-LA-DEE-DA. With STP frontman Scott Weiland clean and sober he uses his lyrrical power to write some of his most beautiful and amazing artwork to date. As always the other band mates ( guitarist Dean Deleo, bassist Robert Deleo, and drummer Eric Kretz ) use their uncanny musical abailities to bring to life this musical masterpiece.With a wide variety of music ( from the soft 'a song for sleeping"" to the heavy dissorted guitar and vocals of ""Dumb Love"" ) STP proves they are a diverse and beautiful group. Shangri-LA-DEE-DA is the fith installment of the STP saga and it shows that it will not be the last."
4,Good Enough,"This was the first STP CD I had ever purchased, and I loved it when I got it. However, after purhcasing every other STP CD, this one falls a little short. Core is by far the best album, and if you dont already have that, go buy that first. However, if you are already a fan of STP, go ahead and pick this up. Its not dissapointing per se, its just not quite as good as some other stuff by STP"
3,surprisingly good,I not a real big stp fan so if you want the truth about this album you should listen to me unstead of someone who pretends to like an stp album when they realy think it sucks. when ever no.4 came out i was disapointed in stp and when i heard they were coming out with a new album i thought it would be crappier than the last. but i was wrong. its accually listenable. when no.4 came out it just sounded like they want some air time and the songs didnt come out very artisticly. but shangri la dee da sounds like more themselves. ive listen to the samples and i have to say days of the week and wonderful are the more catching tunes but they r not my favorite. i couldnt really pick my favorite. i dont really think this is the best stp cd but it is defanitly better than no.4.
3,Quite Different from the other Four,"I can see why some STP fans reject this album. It is quite a bit softer and more mellow than any of their previous four. And I have to admit that some of the songs sound a tad uninspired, kind of that, we are contracturally liable for one more album kind of sound. I think that political events in the band at this time probably prevented them from coming up with something great. Out of my love for the band, I will go no lower than a 3 rating. I just think it was hard to carry on at the level that they were at for so long."
4,Very refreshing and evolutive but still STP sound,"This album must be played a couple of time to get used to some of the songs, but when you get used to it their real good. Scott voice is in a pretty good shape. ""Too Cool Queenie"" is a top seller for sure and all the slow songs. The only drawback that i have is that they were supposed to make a double CD album this time and they didn't, they should have at least put a multimedia section, i don't like broken promises."
3,Starts out rockin' but ends up knockin'.,"I am a huge STP fan and purchased this disc as soon as it was released without first hearing it because I have faith that it wouldn't stink. This disc is comparable to ""Tiny Music..."" in that the band tries for a new sound and different arrangements than what you typically hear from bands left over from the ""grunge days"". The first few tracks smoke and I though that this was going to be their best album since ""Purple"" but then it quickly mellows and never picks back up. This disc is best lisened to in bits and pieces instead of all in one session. This is still a good album from one of the few genuine rock artists left in music today."
3,"Good, but certainly not the best.","I waited for this album with much anticipation considering the quality of their last album ""No. 4"". However, my first impression was less than stellar. In fact, at this point, I would consider this the weakest of STP's efforts to date. It took a couple of listens to get it to 3 stars. Tiny Music took several listens before I really began to like it, so perhaps it will be the same case with ""Shangri-La Dee Da"". The difference is ""No. 4"" and ""Purple"" were great the first listen--this one could take a while."
4,"Best since ""Purple""","Stone Temple Pilots are probably my favorite band of all time. Seriously, these guys are good at what they do, and their sound takes a different, more melodic approach on this cd. From the head banging, ear shocking, absoloutely incredile opener ""Dumb Love"" to the exquisite ""Wonderful,"" this cd really fits all moods and is a very good outing. Their first album ""Core"" is one of my favorites off all time as well as their second, arguably better album ""Purple"" but they started to drift a little with ""Tiny Music.."" and ""No.4"" Don't get me wrong, those are two good albums, but we all expected a little more, as I think STP did, but their completely back in full swing with this latest release. STP forever!!"
4,BAD TIMES FOR MUSIC!,"I just listened to Shangri La Dee Da and, to be honest, is not what I expected, I liked it though, but there's nothing to do with the STP I was used to.Lots of people say STP and other american bands are having a bad time,(maybe because Pop is everywhere) while british bands are taking the lead.Shangri La Dee Da is not usual coming from STP (personally that's what I think), but people should consider Scott is living a happy new life and that makes the difference.Good Work, I will always be proud to be a STP fan!"
3,HUGE improvement from No. 4,"This album is a HUGE step in the right direction for STP. I was greatly disappointed with No. 4, as were most other hardcore STP fans. The album lacked commercial quality, something STP has made their living on.Stone Temple Pilots are back on track with ""Shangri La Dee Da"". That wholesome sound is back and some of their best songs to date are on this album. ""Days of the Week"" is a fabulous song, and ""Wonderful"" is one of their best to date as well."
4,Great Stone Temple Pilots album,"I loved stone temple pilots the first time i heard ""interstate love song"", and i have followed and listened to every one of their albums since. The thing with this album is that its a lot easier than some of their earlier stuff. They are a great band but sometimes their hard grunge stuff proved to be a little unlistenable. And dont get me wrong, there is grunge on the album. But some of the mid tracks on the album are actually easy, and they are quite good. My favorite track on the whole album, if not the year, is ""Wonderful"". Ive never heard this side of Stone Temple Pilots- a vulnerable side. Its a love song. What a concept. Could this song drive them to mainstream pop stardom? i sure hope not--i dont like to think of them as a pop group. This album is pretty good- mixing some of their old sounds with some new ideas."
5,STP = SURVIVORS,"I have been a fan of Stone Temple Pilots since I started high school what seems like a million years ago. I'm 24 years old now and although STP are not my favorite band by any means, they certainly garner more respect from me than anyone else. They defy trends and have lived through a tidal wave of them. They refuse to be pigeon-holed. The reason bands all bands sound alike is because they are all striving to maintain or enhance some pre-conceived commercial image (and I love those bands as well, I'm by no means on a high horse of defiance). STP shrugs at this and repeatedly aspires to do their own thing. In a world of cookie-cutter uniqueness, they are truly unique. This disc is deep, introspective, mature, catchy, multi-layered, draws on a host of influences, and creates many moods. With 2001 halfway gone, I can safely say this is definitely one of the best efforts this year (along with TOOL's Lateralus)."
3,"Great CD, but not as good as some of their others",While it is great that STP finally came out with a new disc after waiting two years. The music is very good but not quite as good as 4 or Core or Purple. The music tends to be little to much Pop and less Rock. This CD is somewhere along the line of Tiny Music a little bit disappointing but still a very good CD.
5,STP does it again!,"When STP put out Core many years ago I was interested and bought the album. Now that is a hard album for me to listen to. With Shangri-La Dee Da STP has continued the right path to glam rock. There are some jems on this album that will stick in your head for a while after listening to them. ""Days of the Week"" cools it down a bit after the hard opening track ""Dumb Love."" I was singing along with the chorus of ""Days of the Week"" on my second time through and it is still in the back of my mind a week later. The other great song I recommend on this album is ""Too Cool Queenie."" I have liked STP from day one and Shangri-La Dee Da just shows they keep getting better and better."
1,Maybe Dave Coutts wants his old job back!!,"Tool is the best band nowadays, for the one, sorely sensitive reason that stp are failures: as stp's career has furthered itself, their albums have died. Tool, on the other hand, only continue to get better with each release. STP NEEDS to stand to take a lesson from Tool's page, and stop putting out fearsomely abnormal pop garbage. To every mistaught, five-star reviewer: you should employ excessively MORE virtuous standards, like the Tool analogy, in your spitefully self-righteous, hidden agenda reviews, where you fake that stp's shangri-la is buyable."
5,Read this before ordering!,"This is a DVD in the ""Classic Albums"" series, which has interviews with the band and Mutt and some other people tangentally related to the making of Hystera. This is NOT the ""Hysteria"" movie.When I got this, I was pretty disappointed that Amazon mislabeled it. After watching it though I am very happy that I ended up with it and it's one of my most watched DVDs.Strictly for music/recording nerds and Def Leppard fans, this is a well done documentary piece on what the band went through when recording Hysteria as well as the touring they did after Rick's accident. Musically it points out some of the nuances that one might miss through casual listening and some great bits which (thankfully, in some cases) never made it onto the album.The DVD has a whole lot of Phil and Joe but Rick really shines on this too and special attention is given to Steve's contributions."
4,How Did They Do That,"Def Leppard give their fans a treat into breaking down just how their most successful album was made. It is an interesting show and includes acoustic performances of ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" and ""Hysteria"", but could've been even better if they gave acoustic performances of songs that haven't been done acoustically before. But still a neat video and a ""must have"" for every diehard Lep fan."
2,okay,lots to be desired...to much talk and not enough music. disc was fine.i really wished there was more of a flow with the cd.
2,"Great Song, Bad Album","LA Song is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. A touching ballad that also has a biting edge. However, after that song I found the rest of the album to be pretty thin. I am not a fan of angst-ridden screaming being passed off as music as I feel so much of this album is. If you like LA Song, I would suggest buying the single. It really is not an accurate reflection of the rest of the album."
2,Uneven albums,"Beth Hart has a great voice for soul , blues and country but for every 3 or 4 great songs per album there are 7 0r 8 slow, melancholy stinkers. I like an occasional ballad but Beth needs to get with a producer who won't allow her to record songs which bring down and detract from her up tempo numbers. The record company should issue a collection of all her faster, blusier and rockier songs on one cd and I guarantee sales will triple. It would bring some much needed attention to her career and really showcase her strength as an heir to Janis Joplin."
2,Let the buyer beware...,"[...]. I wish I had waited and listened to a few of the sound samples and read a few of the more critical reviews as well. This CD is a disappointment. Mediocre songwriting, Top 40 production and oversinging that would be an embarrassment for a true master of blues, soul or R&B. I can't believe someone compared her to a combination of Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin & Melissa Ethridge. She doesn't come close to any, and I'm no fan of Ms Ethridge. Mabe some of her other titles are better bets, but I went to U-Tube and sampled a few videos of her live performances, and they were not impressive either. I'm puttin' this one back up for trade on Swaptree!"
3,Interesting,"Beth Hart sounds interesting, and not unlike the great Ellen McIlwaine. The sample cuts for Ellen on Amazon are not truly representative of how great Ellen was in her heyday. I will give Beth a try....but would suggest others also give Ellen a listen. They both have the same soul, blues and raw talent in their voices - not to mention,the vibrato."
1,"All Style, No Bite!",Beth's got a lot of soul and fire in her belly. It shows in her powerful delivery of these songs but the CD does very little to separate her from the rest of the pack. Not a very memorable CD - the kind you play this week and forget you bought next week.
2,Im screaming for better lyrics,"I bought this album because i loved LA Song thinking that the whole album would touch me like that song did. i was incredibly disappointed. Even though she has an incredible voice, i felt that she could have written more original music. Her voice is so unique that i expected more unique lyrics. Instead this cd sounded too pop. Her voice dosen't mesh well with the Brittany Spears type songs. Maybe her next album will be more original."
1,what's all the fuss?,"""L.A. Song"" is one of the worst and most repetitive pieces of songwriting I've ever heard. How many times can she repeat the same lyrics just to fill a musical phrase? Oh, and ""He lied like a salesman selling flies""?? What a stupid line. I just don't get the appeal. Based on this song I would stay away from the rest of the album, but that's just my opinion."
1,you've got to be joking?,"PLEASE? I don't understand how people can be soooo dense; BETH HART SUCKS! Worse than that, she seems to have gathered a trendy following?~?~? Why? Certainly not because she writes decent lyrics, or even sings well...*sigh* Come now, if there's got to be a new trend in singers, i'd just as well prefer listening to Nirvana again *highly dissapointed*"
5,A smart woman rocker who can SING,"Beth Hart has been getting a lot of rotation on Cities 97, one of the Twin Cities station. I enjoyed ""Delicious Surprise"" and ""L.A. Song"" so much I ordered the CD. What a fantastic choice on my part (patting my own back). The comparisons with Janis Joplin and Sheryl Crow are just, to a point; she's a whiskey-voice female rocker. However, her lyrics are more story-like and insightful than a lot of Sheryl Crow's material and Beth can sing like nobody's business, whereas Janis spent a lot of time truly screaming for her supper. If you like an equal mix of rocking (""Delicious Surprise"" and ""Get Your S**t Together"") and reflection (""L.A. Song"" and ""Mama""), you'll love this CD. And if you like Beth, odds are you'll like her Midwestern contemporary, the more acoustic Brenda Weiler."
4,A very good sophomore effort,"It's hard to believe I met Beth one night in Hollywood at my neighbor's apartment. I had no idea who she was. Well with that shameless groveling out of the way, here goes. I really like this album. The music is great as well as the lyrics... and yes there is a Janis Joplin influence. But thank God it is only a smattering. I would say she draws more from Ricki Lee Jones and Tom Waits. I am giving this album four stars because I would like to see Beth do something different than just follow the pack. There are too many Sheryl Crow and Alanis clones in the Woman Rocker world. I think Beth is capable of going way beyond them. How she chooses to go about doing that, I will leave up to her."
5,BETH HART SCREAMING--Y E A H I GIVE IT 10STARS++++++++++,I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS CD ITS INCREDIBLE SHE IS WHAT IV'E BEEN WAITING FOR--WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HER VOICE BECAUSE SHE IS SO UNIQUE AND IF YOU MISS OUT ON GETTING THIS CD--LETS JUST SAY FRICKEN BUY IT AND THANK YOURSELF LATER DUH! GET IT...BETH HART R U L E S..... I AM GOING TO BUY EVERY CD SHE COMES OUT WITH FROM NOW ON TILL THE END OF TIME--TOO DEEP FOR YA JUST BUY IT ALREADY--JG IN AK-- Y E A H ---------
4,My first big listen to a wonderful voice.,"I've been searching for her albums for a while since I heard about her through being a fan of Joe Bonamassa. I was very pleased with this album. As usual a few songs don't click with me, but this album has made me really look harder for more of her cd's. She can do soul, rock, blues, old school r&b,..."
4,very good! pleasantly surprised! Very soulful.,"I liked it! Bought it for L.A. Song, the rest of the CD is more fast paced and it has some soulful rock tunes! Overall a very good CD."
2,A great receiver if you like audio but hate yourself,"This receiver has two (2) component video in ports (SAT and DVD) but it only has audio out for one (!). Insane. It could have 200 component video-out ports but if only one of them is capable of audio then what is the point? I have never seen engineering this poor fron a brand known for quality. Advertising this as a product with two component out ports is blatantly lying to the customer. If you don't mind crawling around behind your entertainment center whenever you wish to change from cable to DVD, this is the receiver for you!"
2,Does not work with BOSE!!!,"Bought this receiver thinking it would give me incredible sound with myBose 2.1 system but was disappointed. I had an older sony str model and got great sound and deep bass. This model, however, does not push my sub to it its potential. It sounds like my bose computer speakers. Stay away!"
4,Great for the price,I shopped around for a while looking for a decent 5.1 receiver with HDMI ports. I was looking at this model at your typical electronics (CC) store for more. Thought it sounded great there but held off until further searching. Found it here for less.The sound is great. The surround sound is perfect. It has many features that I still haven't had time to play with yet. My old Klipsch Heresy 2's rock out with this receiver. I am very pleased with it so far. 4/5 until I give it the complete testing.
2,"Good sound, but not an A/V receiver","As an audio receiver it is decent, but if you are looking for an A/V receiver, don't buy this product. It advertises as a 2 hdmi passthru, but you only get 1 optical with video, and at 1080i and no audio thru hdmi. You will end up buying an hdmi switcher that can handle 1080p and audio thru hdmi to minimize cost/clutter in all the cables. (ie. might as well bought more expensive product.) In all the confusion consumers have on trying to buy a quality receiver, I wish Sony would stop making inferior products, and sell just 3 models that better fit an audiophiles profile."
5,"For a 5.1 reciever, this is the bomb......","If you want to start a system thats affordable, and has great QUALITY. THIS SONY WON'T LET YOU DOWN......"
2,difficult to set up - but okay for the price,I bought this based on the Sony name but after doing so it reminded my why I don't normally buy Sony products. The set up is very confusing and the biggest con is you have to use a TOS link cable to get sound. I eventually found this out after searching on line. The volume is not earth shattering but that can actually be a good thing as there does not seem to be any distortion.
1,Failed after 4 months,"After less than 4 months, I've had to return the unit. The front display indicates ""Protect"" and the receiver does not work. This is NOT an isolated problem, as there are numerous blogs on the internet regarding this issue. I had anticipated reliability when purchasing a SONY product, not failure. I've mailed my receiver to SONY's service center in Texas and awaiting its repair, and in the meantime, I'm without an amplifier."
3,Sony STR-DG510 HT Receiver,"Good Starter unit for a small apartment or for your lady. Be aware Sony has removed the S-Vid connection for HDMI, obviously looking toward the future. Be prepared to buy new component cables if you don't have a high end system."
3,a/b switch,"whoever heard of a receiver with an a/b switch that does not run both a and b speakers simultaneously! other than that, it seems solid."
3,Good Deal for the price,"So Amazon had marked this receiver down to $99 with free shipping, this is a great product for THAT price. Like other reviewers I was bummed about the HDMI was only for video, and there are only two HDMI hook ups one with the Digital Component Audio, and the other with Optical Audio. so if you had two devices that had optical audio connectors you have a problem. Setup was painless and I used the auto calibrate feature with my sound system sounds great."
2,I really wanted this to not suck...,"I hoped that this reciever would be decent quality piece of equipment for the price (not asking for perfection, or even close for that matter), but was truly dissappointed after the purchase. This unit's max volume was very low compared to the competition, and at about half volume I could already hear distortion on my fairly expensive Polk Audio speakers. I threw this thing on Ebay within 15 minutes of opening the box. Not bad for the price if sound quality isn't even a little important..."
1,Cool!,"I really enjoyed the book. I liked how the pictures were pretty clear. I've always like Batman and Supergirl. I think that they should've gotten together, like not argueing, but this is Batman. He suspects everything.dede"
1,AWFUL,"Loebs worse story, which is bad cause he is usually a great writer. Pluss the fact it is drawn by one of the worst artist in the business. Forget everything you know about the human anatomy, because it no longer matters. Everyone is this book is also Asian. Superman, Batman, WonderWoman, and every body else is Asian. Also SuperGirl has an eating disorder, you don't get the skinny by not puking up your meals. The story itself is awful, and all over the place. Pass this one up if you can. Espeicaly if you have heart problems, cause rhis will surely have suffering a heart attack."
5,Awesome,"If you love Superman and Batman, this is the comic for you. They happen to be my favorite team. The book got to me quickly and it is in great condition."
5,Excellent!!!!,"Esta coleccion de Superman/Batman quita el aliento, te cautiva y quiere devorarlo lo mas pronto posible, es super excelente la combinacion de dos grandes superheroes incluido el increible BATMAN. Supergirl....WOW!!!! Altamente recomendable."
4,A review by an infrequent reader of comics.,"First things first.I am not a gigantic comics fan. I've never been to a comic book shop. I know the big names. Basically, if they had a live action TV show, I know them.So, my opinion is not as well-informed as that of some.Take this opinion for what it is worth since I am not a frequent reader of comics but it is the silliness involving Supergirl that this collection tries to correct. Big fans know what I'm talking about - Supergirl is dead, she's replaced by an ectoplasmic being who is called Supergirl, yadda, yadda, yadda.So, Supergirl from Krypton is re-introduced here as a concept. Thank goodness.The story itself is good, but not nearly as good as Volume #1 in this series. The art is interesting - the men are hyperdeveloped to the point of silliness (their suits look like they are painted on to professional bodybuilders) but the women are wonderful - this rendition of Wonder Woman is the best I've ever seen, including Linda Carter!"
2,Only a cookbook,"I was disappointed with the contents of the book. I was hoping it would also serve as a field guide for finding the ingredients. The descriptions of the wild foods are not descriptive enough to help you actually find them. Also, there are no pictures of any of the plants. I found most of the recipes to be very complex in flavors. (Mostly Asian and Indian) Not that I mind complex flavors. My fear is the spices would cover up the taste of the wild ingredient to much. The first time I try a new food, I want a simple recipe so I better understand its taste."
5,"COOL, FUN, BUY THIS CD!!!","What a blast.No intelligent, deep or thoughtful dissertation here - just a simple and earnest command: BUY THIS CD!EVERYONE always asks me what I am listening to when this is playing - it is just a great kick in the pants. Have some FUN!"
2,a sorry movie,"I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version. They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie. AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married. Enter the Bride. She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions. Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me. The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung. Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress. So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf. It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time. Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie."
3,a victim of sequalitis,"this movie was a pretty good sequel to the first one. but it should have been better. i think that if it werent for the acting ability of brigitte lin this movie would have been a flop. dont get me wrong its a good movie but when you compare it to the first one you can tell it falls short and carries all the symptoms of sequalitis. the best part of the whole movie, which about 90 min. in length, is the end scenes. even though i give it a lower rating i would recommend getting this one, or you will never know how the story ends."
2,What was this,"Bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me. I like the story line and everything and it's pretty sad, but I wanted to see more fight scenes. Don't get this movie is you are expecting action."
4,Good Sequel.,"This film isn't up to the ""Bride with White Hair"" but its still worth your time. Brigitte Lin is positively riveting in the title role. The story moves along with a surprising zip and never really lags. Brigitte Lin has a commanding screen presence and carries the entire film."
4,Not as good as the original but damn good follow up.,"While Bride part two is not the powerful film that part one is, it is still a very good conclusion to a great story. The story paces very well and while Leslie Chueng should have had a bigger part, the ending made this flick worth the time and money I paid for it. If you've seen part one you need to see part two but in it's original form. Not the english voice over version, but the subtitle one and if at all possible, get it on DVD."
3,"COULD""VE BEEN BETTER","I expected the sequel to be as good as the first one, but boy was i disappointed. It totally changed direction and hardly focused on leslie cheung or brigitte lin. I think it could've been so much better! 1"
1,Completely worthless...,"Pretend this never happened. BWWH 1 was heaps better. This sequel is garbage... don't bother. For the record, I would rate Bride With White Hair 8.5/10"
2,Okay if you're a fan of the series and Bridgette Lin,"The story line is direction is okay. Action sequences are good but not spectacular. Fast-paced and confusing at times. It took me 2-days to watch, since I fell asleep on it the first time."
4,Good followup sequel,"It's always hard to film a sequel to a great classic like ""Bride With White Hair."" I agree that the change in directors is to blame. Poor Brigitte Lin really mopes around in this film. Even in her depressed state, Brigitte is stunningly lovely. Christy Chung's role was amusing. I think the actors did their best with the script. As a huge Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung fan, it's still a good movie. The chemistry could have been better but remember they only had the final scenes together when their characters come face to face. It's hard to be combustible when you have approximately 10 minutes of screen time together."
3,Where are the stars?,"A very disappointing sequel to a great Hong Kong film. A change in directors pretty much explains what happened--there is none of the creativity and originality of the first movie. Perhaps as important, Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung are completely misused in this film. The Lin character has become a caricature, and Cheung only appears briefly (and his only significant appearance is at the end of the film). Without the romantic sparks between these two, and missing the imagination of Director Yu, this plays out as a very tired sequel. However, a Brigitte Lin move will always be worth at least three stars to me; I also thought the Christy Chung character was amusing. The DVD version is a good transfer, the subtitles legible, and a lot of language choices. Still, one can't help but be let down after the superb first movie, which really deserved a sequel--it should have been made by Dirctor Yu, however, and used the stars that helped make the first film so compelling."
3,The Bride With White Hair 2,"I loved part 1 , but just to let everyone know before you buy it.The language says english and the cover is in english , but only the subtitle is in english.There is no where on the dvd to change it."
4,A well concluded sequel,"For those who have seen the original - don't expect this one to focus on Bridgette Lin and Leslie Cheung. This movie stars an all new cast of young actors who manage to carry the movie pretty well. The movie focuses on what happened after the 2 star crossed lovers separate - 10 years after the original 'betrayal' and now Bridgette Lin has become a powerful but evil martial arts master who is embittered against all men. I have to admit I was disappointed that Leslie did not have a bigger part in this movie, and that they did not focus on the 2 main characters as much but the ending is one that should not be missed."
4,Giving life to the sword,"Anyone who looks to a book to learn how to swing a sword will forever be disappointed. Those of us who have actually taken the time train in the sword know that direct transmition is the only way (yes, the schools still exist -- go find one).What this book presents (along with some very good subtle sword pointers) is the proper mental attitude you must gain in order to progress on the path. Mr. Wilson does a wonderful job translating a difficult text. If you are serious about sword, get this book AND go find a teacher ..."
5,Wonderful,"I give this book five stars simply because I love it. For anyone who finds Miyamoto Musashi's book a little hard to fathom at first, then maybe you could start with this.I have a number of translations by William Scott Wilson, the most recent being 'The Demon's Sermon on the Martial Arts', I love them all and have to say that I prefer his translations over any other."
5,great book of philosophy,"This book is a must have, lose the idea of a Samurai as a killer and find out how the teachers of the shogun looked at his job"
4,"interested in Zen and Kendo/Samurai/etc, worth the read",A good book on the way of the sword/warrior and the combination of Zen thought within this art. I look forward to reading the translator's (William Scott Wilson) bio of Miyamoto Musashi- The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi.
3,"WHAT??? ""PULSE"" not included?","I can't stand it when record companies put together a compilation and HAVE NO IDEA...what the good songs are! The fact that ""PULSE"" was left off of this cd is UN-BELIEVABLE!!!"
2,Canby's Legion takes a back seat to a seemier universe,"Baldwin has created a steamy universe with a debauched Emperor and crass commercial Empire. Though the hero, Canby, fights for right, the dark and debauched scenes of sexual orgies -- and in one case pedophilia, make this a book unsuitable for younger readers. Baldwin writes as if he was unhappy with the straightforward good versus evil in the Helmsman series and needed to make a universe reflective of everything that is bad.This is a step down in Baldwin's otherwise finely crafted space operas that are suitable for younger and adventurous teens.Canby's Legion is NOT Suitable for younger readers"
2,A poor book overall.,"Flashes of what could have been a great story, but ultimately disappointing. The final pages seeming attempt to turn the story into a fable were too little too late."
4,beautiful film,"Not so much erotic as nostalgic, in which it succeeded very well. An Italian man inherits an old bath house in Istanbul from his aunt who went to live there (and had a great passion for the city). He initially wants to sell it as quickly as possible, but slowly get sucked into the beautiful atmosphere, via the host family that still lives in the building. When his wife finally comes to get him back to Italy, it is too late. However, she too can't resist the temptation of Istanbul, even though it was painful for her finding out that her husband had an affair with the son of the family. The film deserves 5 stars, but somehow the subtitles don't work in the very beginning of the DVD, which is a shame."
5,WAOW,"this one is the most amazing movie I've ever seen. It's not really gay-lesbian movie. it explore a new sensation in movie industry. and director has the all success with this one. if you are open to see a new kind in this industry this is the one. see it, love it. C."
3,Tepid Steam,This isn't a bad movie yet I wouldn't consider it a great movie either. I would have liked to have seen more character development of its main actor as well as more development in the relationship between husband and boyfriend.Overall I thought the movie was fine but I should have watched it first before deciding to purchase. The only real disappointment was the ending where things were wrapped up just a little too predictably.
5,Fountain of Life,"This movie is beautifully shot. The story can be described as ""grace and intriguing"". It is so good that I don't know how to start. If possilbe I will give it six stars.It can be recognized as a gay movie. But in fact, elements of gay life in this movie is little. The most important subject of this movie is about discovering your true self (no matter male or female). Many metaphors appeared in this movie. It reminds me of those Arabic phylosophy I have learned. It reminds me of poems written by Omar Khayyam. The fountain of life never stop, we have only one time to experience. Live the life you want and be happy(mentally, not only phisically)"
2,Pointless movie!,"This movie is pointless. It's not erotic. It's not poetic. It's not passionate. It's not dimensional. It's not dramatic. It's just plain boring, and it doesn't even look very good. Most of the film takes place in dark, dingy rooms. The lead actor (Vittoria Gassman's son) is attractive, but not much in the talent department. Skip this movie."
1,"Drab, murky and uninteresting","Beware of the blurbs for this film which advertise it to be ""erotic"" and ""mesmerizing"" - unless you find glimpes of pot bellied men sitting around a steam room erotic and mesmerizing. The story line is minimal, the characters are dull and uninteresting, and the cinematography is awful! And if you are looking for a gay themed story line, forget it! I saw the dvd of this film and the photography is so dark you can hardy distinguish facial features at times. Not recommended."
1,"It was probably wonderful, but...","The ""language"" shown on the Amazon description page for this film was/is English. Before ordering, I read many of the reviews here. There must be alot of Turkish speaking viewers who thought it quite normal to watch a film in an unusual foreign language (excepting language selections made by Mel Gibson) because that fact seems to have avoided any mention. My reason for this bizarre review is to get Amazon to change their listing and to make it known that... THIS FILM IS NOT IN ENGLISH!!!Too bad too. It was probably wonderful."
1,Steam is lost in the fog...,"Steam's cover delights in telling us that it's a seductive film that ""affirms that happiness is possible in this life"". Whoever reviewed the movie can't have seen what I watched. As other reviewers have said, there is nothing seductive about this movie, and how these dull uninterested characters can be life affirming escapes me. The DVD itself is dreadful, it looks as though it was transferred from an old VHS tape, complete with a tape crease or two. Avoid it at all costs."
3,could have been better.,this movie was a little disapointing. the fact that it was filmed in turkey may be the reason. it could have been a little more sexual. but over all its not to bad.
1,Buy a Different Edition,"This edition was scanned from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost down, therefore, there are typos that resulted from smudged or worn pages. While this information is disclosed in the book as well as in the product description from Amazon, the typos can be distracting while reading. Also if you need to read the entirety of the novel, do not waste your time with this edition as it only covers chapters 1-31. There are many more than that (63 I believe). Overall, I would not recommend this edition to anyone. Do not waste your money on it!"
4,People Never Change,"I chose this book to use for two bookclub meetings, one for the American gilded age and the other for the study of Mark Twain. It's perfect for both. Although it's not the best book written by Twain it is his first full length book and very interesting from that prospective as well. I'll also add that it's not an easy book to read due to the style and language.What is interesting is the story which with some alterations could be written today. The story line explores the dreaming and scheaming of those who want to get rich quick, politicans who are less than honest and those too lazy to work or to have a desire for improvement. It could describe people and situations that we've all encountered (perhaps we can even find ourselves).I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in the age following the American Civil War."
4,The Brilliant Satire Of Twain,"""The Gilded Age"" was my first Kindle book. I read it along with a history of the Progressive Movement, which was enjoyable and useful for placing myself in late 19th-century America. Twain created a satirical tragedy that masterfully encapsulates the excess of the Gilded Age, and the distractions that drove our entire society into a ditch. It's brilliance is manifested by its relevance to our world today, almost 140 years after its publication. The story describes a fundamental aspect of human nature that we all need to examine more closely.Mark Twain is such an American treasure; I wish he had a contemporary counterpart."
4,Today's Headlines,"Senate Seats for Sale...Corruption in Congress...Speculators Losing Fortunes...Lawyers Making a Mockery of the Justice System...these are all things that Mr. Twain and Mr. Dudley poke fun at in ""The Gilded Age."" These are all subjects that Twain could still make sport of if he were still writing today.Most of the action centers on various parties trying to make a fortune without working for it. While this is not one of Mark Twain's better novels it is entertaining and at times reads like something out of a Marx Brothers movie."
1,Buy a different edition,"*** This review is for the cream colored paperback edition with the black lettering.***This edition of the book is extremely cheap. It's fraught with punctuation and printing mistakes that make it very difficult to read. The publishers of the books say that they used some computer software to scan and translate the text of the book to keep the cost low ""for you, the reader,"" But would it have really killed them to pay someone $100 to proofread the damned thing? The mistakes are obvious and numerous. Plus, the second half of the book is left out.It really kills me that such shoddy work is allowed to be printed and sold to the general public. Way to take advantage of lax copyright laws, guys."
3,"As anticipated, the finish doesn't last long ...","With oil rubbed bronze faucets and all, I knew that I had to get a strainer and drain that matched but anticipated that the finishes wouldn't hold up. While the product functions just fine and seems to be just fine structurally, the finish is already starting to disappear after just 6 months or since installing it. It's showing a copper underlying color (which doesn't look horrible at least). With the cleaning and all that goes on in a sink, I somewhat expected that this would happen ... but hoped otherwise. At least for now, it'll be fine ... it doesn't look bad enough to replace just yet."
4,Solid Sophomore Shoulders,"Big Shoulders' debut disc took a melting pot approach to a broad range of American roots music, creating a unique sound. On the 2d CD, they left the melting pot at home and put a broader array of ingredients on display. In addition to the core blues/rock/New Orleans influences, this album includes an Irish jig (""Big Jig""), a waltz (""Last Girl On Earth""), and a howlingly funny polka about everyday life among the working class white ethnics (""The Sout'west Side Polka"").Highlights include an uptempo blues guitar/harp instrumental (""At The Tracks""), a stomping rock attack on sanctimonious meddling fundamentalists (""Heal Yourself"") and Ken Saydak's soulful solo piano & vocal number, ""America, Meet Me Tonight.""Well written songs, well played & sung. It's not quite at the level of their astounding debut, but it's awfully good stuff that any fan of roots music ought to have."
5,Classic Cuisinart Quality,"I still use my 20 year old cuisinart work horse, and recently bought my daughter her first one for Xmas. I thought I'd spare her the one or two cheaper processors you always buy to ""save money"" which end up broken, leaking, dull blades, cracked work bowl, etc. This way-she can learn on the one that actally performs-and lasts.20 years and counting....."
5,Humour with a message,"This is classic English Humour the way only the British can deliverThe Full Monty - Fully Exposed Edition. Out of work, money and a way to support themselves and families these men decide to think outside the box and inside their shorts to bring some classic laughs and messages to a world where old jobs are disappearing and new ones aren't taking their place. Still relative to all of us today."
3,"""The Full Monty - Fully Exposed Edition""","I thought with the title saying ""FULLY EXPOSED"" that there would be a different ending than the theatrical version. BOY, what a disappointment! It was exactly the same!"
4,Overpriced Blu-ray!,What is 101 Distribution smoking? $52.98 list price for the single disc Blu-ray edition of a movie that goes for $15 on a regular DVD? How the heck can the Blu-ray format survive with machines costing $180 and software titles going for $25 and up? Earth to Blu-ray companies: Make the machines and the titles more affordable or say goodbye to the future!
4,Take it off!,"Funny, feel-good comedy about 6 guys who are unemployed and complain about their state of affairs. They agree to do a strip show for a few bucks, but with one slight twist--they'll take EVERYTHING off! Robert Carlyle (who was downright scary as Begbie in ""Trainspotting"") has never been funnier and so at ease onscreen, and the other supporting cast memebers (including Tom Wilkinson) are also good. A great movie about following your dreams, physical appearance, and beating the odds. So why the mere 4-star rating? Because there are virtually no features on this disc (just a trailer), plus the sound is not 5.1 surround but 2.0 stereo. It sounds good for what it is, but I would have like to have gotten a better audio presentation. But these are small gripes: ""The Full Monty"" was one of the better movies of 1997 and warrants your attention."
4,Classic,Love this movie. Careful...the default setting includes subtitles. The bonus DVD is okay but nice to get the movie you can't get in a store.
4,The Full Monty,An entertaining movie with a decent and believable story line about the characters. Good natured humor without being crude. Very enjoyable and funny!
5,A Great Laugh,"Being British I know the 'types' in this movie so well. They are brilliantly portrayed by Robert Carlyle and his colleagues. Also, being a child of the seventies the musical score brough back many memories as I'm sure it did for most viewers. A group of (girl) friends and I got together to see this movie for the first time and were wiping away the tears of laughter. Well done Peter Cattaneao (director) we look forward to more of the same. What can I say - it was excellent and deserves to be what it is, ""the best selling British movie of all time"""
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed, because I thought the DVD would show the guys with full frontal nudity. The title was misleading. I believe that it is the old ""bait and switch"" con. There was nothing different about this movie from what I saw in the movie theater."
5,Wonderful - a film for the REST of us!,"A most enjoyable story of your average guys with everyday problems. Filled with both laughs and heartache, this story and it's marvelous characterizations will thoroughly entertain you all the way to it's wonderful conclusion of self- discovery and triumph. ***** :)Kelly LibatiqueAuthor of ""Divine Knowlege Transfer"" and ""A Toast to the Holy Ghost?""[...]"
5,Robert Carlyle fans - grab this up!,You know you can't wait for TV just to happen to show your favorites. Buy this now and enjoy it whenever
5,This movie is classic British comedy,This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I know many guys who don't want to see this movie because they are strippers but it is just so funny that I didn't care. If you haven't seen this movie before you have to! The plot is interesting and its just hilarious.
5,Absolutely splendid movie,The Full Monty jumped to my top 5 list the first time I saw it. The movie is so well-made it never puts a foot wrong. The characters are so sympathetic and believable you can't wait to see things work out for them. I honestly have to ration myself to once a week viewings. I'm sure I've seen it 15 times already and laugh just as hard every time. What a winner!
3,the full monty,It was a good movie but I was hopeing it was more than what was in the movie. the credits was ok on the second disk
3,Not original,It's funny but you know everything that is going to happen before it happens. It's not original.
1,Not My Cup Of Tea,"I guess the only people who bothered to review this film loved it. I know I am not the only one who hated it, because other people have told me they hated it too.I could not wait to watch this video. I had heard so much about it. I was so excited. I was going to get to see the wonderful, funny, ""The Full Monty."" Ten minutes into the film I knew I was in for a long, boring experience. I had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying. The story interested me not a bit. The only thing I thought WAS interesting was when the guys were practicing their strip tease. Unfortunately, it never lasted long enough. I was so relieved when this film was over. I felt like I had just gone through an endurance test. And before anyone tries to tell me I don't understand the British ""sense of humor,"" my favorite book I had to read in college was written by a British man, and it was a funny book (The Complete Yes Minister). I just didn't like ""The Full Monty."""
2,Chuffing rubbish!,"This comedy (so it's called) became a big hit in 1997 and it seemed everyone loved it. However upon buying it on video I found it to be completely dull. Ok odd parts were funny, but it was'nt the funniest film ever, and it's beyond a joke to call it Britains best comedy. I can't see how Americans could like it because the characters talk in a northern accent."
1,A test of credibility,"THE FULL MONTY is a movie buff's test of credibility. It doesn't have the suspense to carry on as a drama. If it is a comedy, the film is a one joker. It is predictable to the nth. Scene A: We're off, we're going to get going with our nude revue--oh! oh! there is a problem that we have to sort out with one of the guys who is going to back out of dancing in the nude and that's funny! Scenes B,C,D etc. : Same as Scene A with a different guy ad predictalitum. What ever happened to those good British comedy story writers who gave us Wrong Box and Ladykillers?"
5,<.< >.>,5 stars purely because of Robert Carlyle.This movie is very lame and filled with silly gaffs. But I think that that is why I love it so much. One of my favorite movies.
1,Not Funny,"A quite stunningly overrated film. Blazing Saddles, Airplane!, Naked Gun and Clerks are all funny films. The Full Monty is just rubbish."
4,"Finally, a book to combat the destruction","After suffering through multiple ""renovations"" where art was destroyed, churches re-arranged and organs thrown out, it is nice to finally have a concise guide to combatting the unnecessary and in some cases, unlawful, renovations of our churches.A previous review said the book was completely out of context and served to divide. What the author failed to acknowledge is that the arguments explained in Rose's book are all real and all wrong. Division is good when the truth is brought forth. ""Consensus"" based on falsehoods is never right.The quotes used by Rose show that what we currently experience is not what the council intended. Even when adding the caveats to them that the previous reviewer did, the quotes still speak volumes against the church stripping we see today."
5,I knew2 this before I read it,"And this confirms it. Great job by Michael Rose. Of all the wierded out interpretations of Vatican II this one touched the people in the pews most most directly. Along with ""Goodbye, Good Men"" and ""Ugly as Sin"" he exposes the ""Spirit of Vatican Two"" to be much like the naked emperor."
5,Down the tubes,Michael S. Rose places in words what we American Catholics have been noticing for decades--our rich Catholic heritage has gone down the tubes!
1,Don't buy this book!,"Not because it's not worth it; quite the opposite: this book contains only some chapters of Walden. Penguin has a low-priced volume which includes Walden and Civil Disobedience.This (Walden) was one of the most important books I've read in all my life. I have re-read it and I will do so again in the future. Thoreau has some of the most interesting ideas I've read; you won't agree with him on many accounts, but he will force you to think.Don't believe or accept everything you read but do read (or watch or listen to) everything you can and then try to make some sense out of it all."
1,Not Hayworth's Voice,"Rita Hayworth was dubbed in almost all of her films by Jo Ann Greer and Anita Ellis - it's Ellis you're hearing in Gilda, and Jo Ann Greer in Pal Joey, for example. Hayworth did sing on the Carol Burnett show once, and it's on the combo CD of Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich."
2,I-caps,"My husband uses I-caps areds formula. This particular I-caps specifies 4 caps per day, where the one we bought from drug store was two caps per day. This was a less potent formula, so not a savings."
5,Icaps Areds Formula Eye,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UZU2FU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis item was recommended by a doctor for my wife. We found this site to have the best price with fast delivery, and you get what you order. Highly recommended this seller."
3,"These are not low rise, but still good breeches","These breeches are not low rise. They are mid to high rise. They are still nice and since I only paid $20.25 for them, I'll keep them despite them not being exactly as described. They are still nice breeches."
5,Great toy,"My 3-year old son loves these puzzles. Yes, the pieces have odd shapes, even round, but that is exactly what he likes. He can slide the pieces until they align. He never liked the regular puzzles with the regular pieces. It also helps to have a picture underneath. Although the picture underneath is different, it is similar enough to tell him where to put Thomas. It is much easier for him than those puzzles which have only a small picture on the box as guide."
5,This book is the reason I started reading books,"I first read this at about the age of five, while I was growing up in the Jungles of Colombia. The description of the jungle was so realistic and vivid. I continued to read it about every few months for the next ten or twelve years. Then I lost it and didn't read it for ten years or so. I finally found it on e-bay had to shell out some cash to add it to my collection of childrens books. It is as good as I remembered. It only takes two hours or so to read, and I still pick it up and read it a few times a year. I don't know what more to say about it; it is just one of those special books with an indefinable something that makes it great. Of course, if it was not an integral part of your childhood, you may balk at dropping a hundred bucks on it. I was able to get mine on ebay for a good price, but that was just my luck that no one else bid."
5,the change is quick,"the first thing i noticed on this album is that there is a differance between the sound on this and the sound on good mourning. normally this is a bad thing, but with tracks like ""hating every minute"" and ""sadie,"" it's hard to knock it. the alkaline trio is the reason i listen to punk rock."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"After reading all of the 5 star reviews, I bought this, but I was disappointed over the small sizes of so many of the reproductions. In fact, there's only one illustration reproduced in something resembling the actual size of the original pulp cover. There's a tremendous amount of white space on the pages -- a better layout design could have utilized this space to increase the sizes of the illustrations. The printing itself is just okay. As a comparison, the covers of the Nostalgia Ventures Doc Savage series look much better than anything in this volume. Obviously there's no other choice if you want to have a book of this fine artist's work, but let's hope that someday someone else puts together a book that really does Baumhofer justice."
3,Killer Nun (1978),"A mentally disturbed nun develops some nasty habits in this cult horror tale. Suffering from a brain disorder, morphine-addicted Sister Gertrude (Anita Ekberg) spins out of control.She tries to get help, but none of her colleagues at the mental hospital where she works take her seriously- until someone starts murdering the patients.Gertrude's erractic behavior makes her the prime suspect, so the Mother Superior has Gertrude committed- but the murders continue."
3,ONE bad nun,"She was bad but I wish she was meaner, I was wondering if all the nuns were lesbians sometimes. I am through with nun films."
5,Great product,"Looks great, was easy to install (if U R somewhat handy). Is a shinny glossy black but looks ok with my black composite sink."
3,Cheap,This product is cheaply made. I'm sending it back. It's all plastic and probably wouldn't last very long. Not recommended.
2,The Orange overpowers the Carrot Taste,"As the reviewer stated before, the orange is quite acidic and the carrot juice is not noticeable. Hopefully the benefits of the carrots will still be felt in my body though.I purchased the orange and carrot as the Lakewood brand's Carrot juice has lemon juice in it which is not truly carrots only. Carrots by themselves are excellent in a juice form I don't know why they can't stick to the basics or come up with a better flavor to mix than orange or lemon."
1,Wow shocked at the taste,"I bought this thinking that it would taste delicious, at Whole Foods.. It was $4.49 which is small for the size, also leading me to believe that I would taste delicious organic carrots and orange. It just tasted really watered down, and just ... not good! I barely tasted any carrots and I did taste orange but very acidic. I love sour fruits but this was just not good. The color of the bottle fooled me. Don't buy this item, save your money. Wish I went for Odwalla. Oh well lesson to be learned."
3,Organic Orange Carrot Juice,"A great product but a little too pricey. The product itself is priced right, but the shipping is way too much, in fact it almost doubled the total purchase price.I will try to find a similar product locally before paying these shipping prices."
2,overdone,"I'd get this book for the quality of the paper and type (at least that of the version I bought back in the early 90s) and the great presentation of the French originals. People with even a high-school knowledge of French can appreciate Baudelaire's ideas and musicality. It's impossible to translate the latter into English, so why even try?The best thing about the ideas in the poems is that they are expressed in very simple language. I would have prefered a similarly simple, immediate English translation without resorting to stuffy ""poetic"" language (as well as over-interpretation--many images sneak into the English that are just not there, or only suggested, in the French). The only way to really appreciate the intricately constructed meter and rhyme is to read the originals.I know this is probably a matter of taste in translation, but reading the English translations in this volume really brings me down sometimes!"
3,This book is in French!,"Don't be fooled by Steven McLeod's review. This book is not an English translation of the French poet's work. It is printed entirely in French with no side-by-side translation. Just don't make the same mistake I did and send it as a gift to a non-French speaking friend!(By the way, my three stars mean nothing as I couldn't read the book either, but was required to fill-in the field to submit this ""review."")"
4,A good reference,"When I studied in University, I have a chance to use this book to finish term project. Later, I find I can not leave this book. This book is not suitable for the design. But it gives a lot of information for you to understand the design mannual."
3,"Thorough history, but not the most exciting F1 footage","I think this is a very well put together history of F1, with some content that overlaps other DVDs I have but this title seems much more complete. However, in this video you will spend a lot of time looking at parked cars while listening to a narrative of their accomplishments, leaving a bit to be desired as far as seeing them in action on track from the cockpit or the tv cameras. The extra features include some text describing interesting incidents of various champion drivers - this is again the kind of material I would have preferred to see, not read about."
5,It's got Cult written all over it,"This is a great movie. It's very funny, spontaneous, & well acted. All the actors make each character memorable, no matter how little screen time they get. From a asian guy named 'The soul man' with an e, to a son who's parents think he's gay, if you give the movie a chance you'll love this."
2,Cheap meals but they taste cheap too,"The meals in this book are in deed inexpensive but they are very basic and somewhat bland. We've tried at least half the recipes. The recipes are also not diet conscience. Most of the recipes are pretty high in carbs, fat and salt and thus this book was given away. If you are a pretty heavily active, thin family who is pretty much steak and potatoes then you'd love this book. However, if you like variety, new and exciting things to try, this book will leave you hungry for something else."
5,Cheap But Delicious,"I have four kids and a husband with big appetites and our grocery bill was sky high.I have been able to substantially reduce my grocery bill using the guidelines in this book. Since I have used the receipes and suggestions in this book,my life has become easier because I always have ingredients on hand for meals.Jonni McCoy is a real blessing to Mothers and I have yet to try a bad receipe from her cookbook.As a matter of fact,all of her books are fantastic.She is a genius at getting right to the center of a problem and gives no useless information.With all my responsibilities,I don't have time to read useless info.I think that is what most Mothers need .I would buy anything she writes,sight unseen.Looking forward to her next book."
3,Nice addition to Recipe-Book Collection,"While this book as a ton of good recipes, I find I don't make nearly as many as I thought I would. Good addition to my recipe book collection but not necessarily a 'must-have'."
2,Find a copy to look at before you buy...,"I was not satisfied with this book. I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that it is very basic - I think it might be helpful to someone who doesn't have much cooking experience, but if you do it won't help you much. I doubt I will make anything from this book, and I have to say nothing really sounded that great. One of my main problems with this book it that every chicken recipe called for boneless, skinless breasts - how un-frugal can you get?? That is absolutly the most expensive way to buy chicken, and don't tell me it is the only healthy option - it won't kill your family to eat chicken legs once it a while. Give me a break! If you are new to both cooking and frugality, you might get something out of it, but otherwise, take my word for it - you already know everything the author has to say."
4,USEFUL!,Food tasty overall - being from TX did have to add some spice but didn't blow our budget. Introduced us to TVP - we mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with meat - love it! Really helped us think about food and money in a different way. Have given copies to friends for birthdays - reviews back are positive.
1,"Missed the frugal mark, no originality","I found very little original recipes in this book, if any. Recipes could be found online for free from most any recipe site. the recipe for SUN TEA is actually included! Most chicken recipes include boneless skinless chicken breasts. 12 days of turkey page is no help at all...mostly substitutions for the mayo on a sandwich.This book could have been much better. A frugal person would never spend money on this book because most of the info could be found elsewhere, or a frugal person would know how to make sun tea without the book.chicken nugget recipe can be found in The Freezer Cooking Manual from 30 Day Gourmet : A Month of Meals Made Easy"
1,Missed the Mark,"Not enough new info in book to make it worth buying. If you can make tea, you already know one recipe in this book! Recipes not really very frugal."
4,Good book,it arrived on time all is well not much more to say about it no complaints done with review done
4,All New Englanders will recognize the setting and love it.,"I loved this book, the descriptions of places and events were easily visualized. The format of each character giving his or her view of events was interesting. And most of all the stunning turn of events, all the while keeping you sympathetic to the book's main character."
2,RashoMaine,"I was intrigued at first by the four person viewpoint similar to the Japanese classic Rashomon. Although I finished it, the story began to lose me (I'll try and do this without giving anything away) when Beatrice responds as she does to Warrren. Nothing given to us about his character up to that point would seem to cause her doubts. Not to mention that what finally happens between them seems to evolve not out of the normal flow of their lives but more in the way of an author's attempt to write a potential movie. It had so many possibilities in the beginning but dwindled, at least for me, to hokey contrivances."
2,Not at all what was expected,"It may have all the songs from the air gear anime but, it doesn't have the full version of the opening credits. The music is very techno. The picture on front it good. In the booklet there seems to be the lyrics for the opening song but there in japanese."
3,Mediocre Gardening Book,"There's very little personal insight or wisdom here, but it's a semi-decent book that will teach you the basics of vegetable gardening within a very watered down and generic framework. If you really are a dummy, you might like that kind of thing, but there are much better choices available. I recommend The Vegetable Gardener's Bible instead for two reasons:#1: It's blasphemous.And #2: The author distils 30+ years of experimentation and trial and error (lots of error) into a compendium of useful and accessible knowledge. It has everything THIS book has and tons of stuff it doesn't, like the importance of deep soil and the disadvantages of roto-tillnig, and lots of functional, useful advice on compost etc. etc.Anyway I don't recommend buying this book. Try the library if you're curious."
3,Questionable effectiveness,"I can't say this herbal solution, while interesting, was effective as a remedy for my health situation. WHY it contains grain alcohol is, also, a little confusing from a a health standpoint. It hasn't harmed ME. But, since I've been using it, I've learned of and use something incredibly more effective to cure my skin infection. All I can suggest, to curious users, is try it and see if IT works for them."
5,This cable works flawlessly,"There isn't much to say, the cable does exactly what it's supposed to and is working flawlessly connecting the HTPC in the living room to my router in the bedroom. I'm able to send data across it at 100Mbps so I'm happy with it."
1,Martin Eden,I usally like all Jack London books but martin Eden was so boring I couldn't read it. It was a waste of money.
2,Not famous for good reasons.,Three chapters on doing laundry. 30 chapters on trying to get a story published. Stupid ending. Not worth the while.
1,what crap,"this book has it good points but it is someting one should not spend too much time looking into. this book has the most general plot that that you can get out of hundreads of other books. it is the good old "" guy wants girl but not good enough then gets better than she is then gets shot down to where he was before she dumps him hegets famous then she wants him for his money he realises this and that he has no friends so he drowns himself."" asl it seems that every chapter is just a bout her lips, or someting elso about ruth. he describes way too much an it takes 100 pages for anything to really happen. this book sucks i think martin eden should have realized that he was an idiot in the first chapter so that i didnt have to read the whole thing."
4,Martin Eden,"When looking for leisure reading material, I would definitely recommend Jack London's, Martin Eden. If you are not used to London's word usage, you might be caught off guard. Despite his word usage the reader can still get the main points of the story. This story is one that touches on many topics such as self discovery, tragedy, trust, and the evolution of one's being. As you read Martin Eden you cannot help but identify with the main character in some way. By connnecting with the main character you will find yourself suppporting him in every way. You will celebrate his achievements and console him in his many failures. All of which make for an engaging novel. Those individuals that wish to cheer for Jack London's ""Rocky"" should read this novel.Once you start this novel you will not want to put it down until you have completed it."
5,This novel will make you an angry young man again...,"And being an angry young man is not a completely bad thing. I guess its better than selling out. This novel is about class in America, ambition and the inevitability of selling out when success is achieved. It is also a classic study of the adage, ""be careful what you wish for because you just might get it"". The main character's discovery that upper class values are not what he imagined is chilling. As a Gen-Xer this book appealed to me on many levels proving that it is truly a timeless classic. Highly recommended."
4,Sidewinder and Beyond,"If you're a fan of the Lee Morgan ""Sidewinder"" and ""Rumproller"" sessions, you should give this disc some serious consideration. The pairing of Virgil Jones on trumpet and Foster on tenor strikes a similar note, though there are clearly differences between Foster's and early Joe Henderson's sounds. In addition to several tunes that evoke the classic Morgan/Henderson pairing, you may quickly become a fan of the extended version of Fats Waller's ""Jitterbug Waltz"" featured on this set. Definitely worthwhile if you are starting to explore the playing of some solid musicians whose names don't feature so prominently in the popular history of jazz."
1,"CAN""T TRUST THESE REVIEWS","Once again it seems the HOGARTH clan wrote the other reviews.....can't think of any other reason why anyone would write a good review for this cringeworthy offering......after the first vocals on track one my wife gave me a withering look and demanded that I stop that noise.....we don't always agree on music, but in this case she was dead right.....HOGARTH must be tone deaf....his singing is horrid and sends shivers down your spine for all the wrong reasons.....the songs are totaly cliche and his guitar playing is almost inaudible.....the mix takes the guitar into a far corner of another studio....taking the quality of the playing, this is not a bad thing......I've also travelled in elevators that provided far more interesting soundtracks than this insipid mix of pseudo soulfull tunes....this washes over you in a most unpleasant way and it is not an experience I ever want to repeat"
5,refreshingly original,"this is such an original, diverse CD. showing many different vocal and instrumental arrangements, hogarth has put together his best work since his days with the heavy metal horns. from a song about an online love affair to a stirring stevie wonder cover, this cd sucks you in and instantly will make you a fan. i've been a fan for years and as good as this latest cd is, it is all the better live. if you get a chance to see this artist in the boston area, you can fully experience one of local boston's best."
1,What is she thinking!,"This album that coco just released is really disappointing. Yeah, she can sing but there are a lot of singers in asia that can sing much better then her. It just seem that the record company just wanted to stick someone with an asian face in the market to attract the asian buyers. The album sounded the same from the beginning to the end and did you guys noticed the words! They were horrible! I like her asian cds so much better then this one."
3,Personally I'd give it 3 and a half stars,"I've heard of better songs by Coco than these on her other Chinese albums. Plus the lyrics were much more better than these cheesy love songs. However, she has a lot of talent and a beautiful voice so I give her a 3 and a half. Even though she does bring in a little Chinese with her (One of her songs in the bridge she starts saying something chinese but most people can't tell) overall, the songs you may tire out easily. It'd be better if it was more like her other albums. Oh well, good luck in the future, Coco."
2,Please stop the hype,"This album is no more than ordinary. I prefer her chinese albums.And please people stop the hype. Coco will not be the first asian to sing in Oscar, it's Lea Salonga. And the only undefeated asian songstress in music mainstream today is Jocelyn Enriquez. And, this indonesian contemporary ethnic artist named Anggun."
2,Okay Try...,"Okay, I admit that Coco Lee can sing a bit better than Britney Spears... But I think that her voice is rather thin although she can sing all the ""Ah""s and ""Ee""s in R&BThe songs in this album seems to be repeating itself... However, there are some nice numbers like ""Do You Want My Love"", ""Just No Other Way"", ""Before I Fall In Love"" and ""All Tied Up""... Other than that, the songs are just like variations of this or that tracks. Further more, most the songs in this album are in slow numbers except for the 1st track which is more exciting... The others can put you slowly to dreamland... As simple as that :-)People in Asia should not buy this album because it is not as good as her Chinese albums. Further more, since Coco Lee hit the U.S. market, she has become more cocky than ever. People in U.S. should buy this album because you would be able to hear a bit more better singing than Britney Spears."
1,Hohum....,"Another one of those pop albums.... not bad, nothing fantastic either, in my opinion that is! As bad as (or as good as) chris. aguill, brit. spears, etc etc etc"
1,Belongs in the Bargain Bin at Best,"I heard this album recently, while shopping at a local record store. All I can say is that there is absolutely nothing special about this album. Besides the fact that she's asian, she sounds like every other bubblegum pop singer out there. She has no niche in the market, and her singing isn't great. You know the phrase ""I've seen better, but not many?"" Well this doesn't fit! I've heard better AND many! There's nothing special about the songs either. They sound like every other R&B song out there. If she thinks she can make it with an album like that, she should guess again! This one blows chunks.All I can say in a nutshell about this album is, SONY MADE A BIG BOO-BOO promoting THIS one to compete with today's pop market!"
2,Hmmmmmmmm.........,"No one should support her just because she is Asian. That is being biased. Only thing I can say is that she needs to bringing in something new...as Jennifer Lopez introduced Latin/Pop/R&B, etc. She should have put some ""Asian"" flavor to her music. I don't know why everyone from all different race is trying to be more ""black"" than black people. What she's doing is everything that was done in 1998-1999. Plus, Kelly Price's song sounds just like Chuckie Booker's song...I mean ""Just Like It."" She can definitely use some new song writers. Her title track ""Do You Want My Love"" features an un-known rapper who is a cheap copy of Kid Capri...Anyways, for all of you interested in this album, just download it via MP3..."
4,Fantastic Lyrics,"Coco Lee is a fantastic singer. I love the R&B sound she has her voice is so exuberant. I have many favorites on her cd. I would of never guessed she was asia. I never heard of COCO Lee until I saw the movie Runaway Bride, upon hearing her voice on the movie soundtrack. I decided to purchase her cd and I have NO regrets."
5,HOT COCO!,COCO LEE HAS TALENT! SHE IS A WONDERFUL SINGER AND HER SONGS ARE VERY CATCHY! SHE COMBINES BOTH CATCHY SONGS AND BEAUTIFUL BALLADS. BUY THIS CD RIGHT AWAY!
3,Nice try!,"Coco's voice is sexy and it's suitable for most of the songs. However, it is sad to say that among the 10+ songs, only about 3 is nice like ""Do You Want My Love"", ""Before I Fall In Love"" and ""Just No Other Way"". The others songs sounds rather alike.... Just like Track 6 is just a variation of track 7... Not much difference, but it's a nice try since this is her first time in the U.S. market. I think the people from the U.S. maybe a bit prejudice against Coco because this is the first time an Asian actually break into the U.S. music industry and people tend to compare her with America's very own singers. Maybe wait for a few albums later and she'll be as good as other singers in America...."
5,Coco's up there with the best,Come on you gotta admit that she's got it. She's got the grove to her songs. If you listened to some of her Manderin songs it hits you like 'Wow'. This CD is one of the best that I've heard from her. I wish tht she would translate some of her asian songs into english though. But this CD is a pretty good CD for the states. Buy it if you want something to jam to.
4,NOT BAD! BUT SOMEBODY HATES HER BECAUSE SHE IS ASIAN!,"I don't think that this is a bad album at all (at least we like it)!Somebody (the same person) reviewed it a few times JUST to show how much he/she hates the Asian Music in the States (this indicates that his/her choice of listening to music is so limited) ! We do not like some of the Western Music too(not 100% from the west, some originally from Africa (especially the rap songs and the Latin Songs, it's all the same and the MTV is the worse!)."
5,New artist on the loose,Coco Lee is an awesome singer. Listen to her lyrics. Her voice is fantastic. Give her a try!
4,Poor Coco...... Sony could've done better,"I am a big fan of Coco. I bought her album before it was released in the US from am Asian CD store online. I must say that I was dissappointed of the album. I think many of her Chinese albums are actually a lot better than this one. Sony really didn't try hard enough to show her true talent. They didn't even try hard to promote her. I wish one day I can see her on MTV or VH1. As for the people talking about her hair..... Give it a rest, she had been doing this since she started singing. I believe it is her personal trait. How many Asian girls can pull of this look? Not too many. I think she looks great! Sony Music, please be nicer to Coco!"
4,not as bad as all you people say it is,ok so what if she doesn't have a distinct voice? ever heard of nothing new under the sun? anyway this album is pretty good. good songs and i'm glad to see that music is becoming more and more internationalized
3,"Coco is Coco, accept her or not, she's still in the business","Okay, after listening to the CD, it was a)not as bad as people might say it is, afterall, debuts from other singers are usually varietized in order to feed the entire market before deciding which genre to land in. Take an example, Britney has the very very cotton candy pop - Baby on more time, Crazy and the soulful - From the Bottem of my Broken Heart. An artist need a variety in their first album. If Coco released a single of all soul or country, she would be critized for being too specialized and Sony would not support her in advancing into the American market. For those who do not like her : Don't buy her CDs and ignore her. For those who like her : Support her. Ignore her race, skin colour and listen to her voice( isn't that what music is about? )"
2,DISAPPOINTING BUT SOMEWHAT A GOOD EFFORT,"After I listened the CD for few times I find it tiring. Lack of decent lyrics and the melody is pretty much copy of others. There was nothing special in her album. Her Chinese CD's were pretty decent I am just disappointed that this CD ain't as good as her chinese CD's. Maybe it's the U.S. marketing strategy, I really think this CD can be a lot better. Besides, she is not the best singer that I have heard. Try Shanza, Sandy Lam, Sally Yeh and others."
1,No effort,"Coco Lee may have talent, and her voice is incredible. Too bad it's not once put to good use. The CD is laced with recycled and boring R&B tracks. She may have a reputation, but it's meaningless unless the CD is quality. It's not. Sadly, she tries too hard to conform to American pop culture. Instead of introducing an Asian sound, she brings nothing new. While she has the talent, her lack of effort places her with the Britney and Christina wannabes."
3,"Ever see that movie ""Fear of a Black Hat?""","In that movie, they make fun of how Martha Wash didn't get video credit for singing on ""Everybody Dance Now."" One scene shows a small Asian woman being interviewed by Kurt Loder, saying, ""I talka like Asian, but singa like black girl...like Paula Abdul!"" *Okay, you'd have to see it for it to make sense...*Now, not to say that CoCo really belts anything out on this album, but I made the connection because I could close my eyes and easily believe I was listening to anything by Toni Braxton, SWV, or En Vogue. CoCo has a great voice and a lot of potential. The beats were good, and there may be a bit of bubble-gum pop sound, but she does sound more mature than Britney. Hey, I bought the CD, so I'll give her credit, CoCo can perform. Great for pumping in your car stereo on a Saturday night cruise, when the sound is more important than the lyrics. It'll be interesting to see what she does for a follow-up."
4,"Not Bad, Not Bad At All","CoCo Lee's English debut offers catchy songs, decent vocals, and even a nice looking person on the cover. However, that's about as far as it goes. There's nothing here to distinguish CoCo from other pop acts. I had the oppurtunity to sit next to Ms. Lee at a performace here in San Francisco, and she told me herself that she's very proud of her new album Exposed, but just a little embarissed about this one. I wouldn't be embarissed...I just wouldn't be too proud. If you're a diehard CoCo fan, then def. pick this up, but if you're just looking for good pop music, get Exposed, or the regular version of this CD. The bonus remix is nice, but not anything too special. I bought this in China Town, and this was the only version they had. If you like CoCo, also try Tata Young. She has a great, near-perfect album called I Believe."
3,This is not her best...,"Don't get me wrong, but her Chinese CDs are far better than this one... She is a talented singer and not many Asian singers speak English as well as she does (a huge advantage for her here). I have listened to her Chinese CDs and I must say that this CD is not as bad as some reviewers said. Okay, I admit this is not her best work...Sony should have done better! I mean, come on, you can even listen to the music samples here before you buy it, so why buy it and then talk trash about her just because she is Asian. CoCo being Asian has nothing to do with the fact that she can sing. She, as a human being, is gifted with an amazing voice. See, this is all we have to know, right? Let's hope her 2nd CD for the USA market will be better. :)"
3,There are still people living in a cave,"Although I'm not a Fan of Coco I still want to say that her voice is good and she's quite talented. The one bad thing about her is that she kind of lacks her own character. R&B is hit but it doesn't mean it's good for her to enter that category too. She should do what's more suitable for her.The one who has made more than 5 neg. reviews on the same CD obviously tries to show that he is so biased that he couldn't stop degrading others whom he views as a group of ""culturally inferior"" people trying so hard to copy(he said Americans are culturally superior), but actually it is that he's like living in a cave, never able to go outside to see how the real world is like, by only sitting inside the cave he feels satisfied. Since he never saw the real world, he doesn't know it and thinks that his own world is the best. If Americans are culturally superior there wouldn't be people who think like him ."
2,Talented Coco in need of better songs,"Coco is a major star in Chinese speaking countries and although not poweful, she can actually sing. Her first English album is a main stream oriented R&B, hip hop and I admire her guts. However, her problem with this album is very weak song writing and no originality. I only liked the first song and that's about it. She has a great potetial to have hits though, only if someone writes a good heartfelt song for her. I am not sure if R&B, bad girl image is the right track for her, since she lacks the attitude. Hoping everything will be better in her next album."
4,"Not known here in Holland, but certainly worth buying!","I've come across Coco when I was looking for music by Julio Iglesias on the net. Listened to a duet of them and was astonished by her voice. I did not know who she was so I searched the net and found some Chinese songs of her. A realy great voice (and a nice looking girl too :) ) Now I came across her first English CD and I bought it imediatly. I must say that she can do mutch better then this because althoug I do not understand Chinese, I like some of her Chinese songs more (Stay with me tonight etc.) but this is her first English CD and I think we will here more of her soon. I live in the Netherlands and there is almost no way to find any cd's of Coco here. I hope she makes it all over the world."
3,"It's the songs, stupid.","Coco has an amazing voice, listen to her in concert, like I did, and you'll realize this for a fact. The CD itself was disappointing only because she was given outdated and lame songs. If you were Sony, would you give your best works to an unproven(in the states) artist? Especially an asian artist in an industry dominated by white/black/latin artists? You all have to remember how political the entertainment industry is. Who gets the good songs? The ones that LOOK like they will sell. You ever see a non-asian buy asian music? Or anything asian for that matter, besides a toyota? Listen to the CD again, but this time, put all your bias aside, and listen to COCO, and not just the lyrics, or the melody, or the lack of whatever you're looking for. She has an awesome voice, and when given the right material, she'll prove it to the world. Get with it Sony, she deserves better."
4,"Beautiful voice, great talent","It's sad that due to her ethnicity, she might not be able to get any attention in the U.S., despite the fact she was born and raised here. This album is her first release on a U.S. label, although she has been adored in Hong Kong and Asia for years. I like her because she has one hell of a voice, and not one that is suited for the teens (although she does draw that type of audience in Hong Kong). There's a lot of soul and depth in Miss Lee, and she shows this on an album that is one part R&B, one part dance, one part ballads, all evened out. She just released a new album in Hong Kong, PROMISE, and if you like this one, you might as well search for that one too."
3,standard R&B/pop fare at best...,"As an Asian-American, after hearing all the hoopla surrounding Coco of how she's a huge star overseas, I decided to hear samples of the album for myself. All I can say is that she definitely has a great voice and talent, and her stuff's not that bad. As for the ""Mariah Carey of Taiwan"", well, in some ways that's stretching it a bit. Don't get me wrong, there's only one Mariah Carey and that's HER. If you like Jennifer Lopez, Christine Aguilera, Monica, or Brandy, then you'll like Coco. This is coming from a guy who listens to alternative (Smashing Pumpkins, U2) and heavy metal (Metallica, Soundgarden)!"
1,Coco will not be the first Asian to sing in Oscar,The one star I gave is not for Coco's CD. this is only to inform you that Coco will not be the first Asian to sing in the oscar its Lea Salonga.More power to coco although I don't hear her name here in the US anymore.
2,She didnt make it!!,"Sorry to say, She didnt make it here in the U.S. Her songs are just as generic as some other artist. Shes only popular to her own fellow asians(mostly chinese i suppose) Voice quality? unsurprising and not convincing enough to American Market. Here in America, competition comes first. Originality here comes first, and of course good music. one instance, Macy Gray, good music and creativity. not just by copying others craft. Shes not pretty but American loved her songs. She has an interesting voice may not be compared to Mariah, Whitney or Celine but you will know that she owns it. Its her trademark. And, one thing why asians will never make it here in US? coz they always compare theirselves to foreign artists. Its like they cant be what should they supposed to be and not taking ones name to gain popularity. Its either the artists will be blamed or the media. You know? Asian thingy!!"
1,nothing special at all,the music sounds canned and her voice is alright but it's not getting treated right on this by the numbers formula R-N-B of today.
4,"Finally, vocal quality","Why her album may not be the most original by touching on love. The songs do add some refreshing lyrics. The thing I like about this album the most is CoCo has very impressive vocal control. With all the artist out there that shouldn't be, it's nice to find an artist that can actually sing. Good vocalist are hard to come by now, so I totally welcome her voice. Some parts she sings just leaves you saying ""WOW"" Keep an eye on this one.-L.M."
4,Coco's fan!,i think the album is good..I dont know why some ppl are so mean to her!!no discrimination please!! Give her a chance..!!
1,pretty sad.....will not pave way for more asian singers,"for some crazy people to suggest that she isdefinitely in the same class as Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion is absolutely insane SHE COPIES AND SINGS ALL OF THIER SONGS! which is what all singers do in asia anyway..she trys so hard to be hip and urban on this album, and its pretty sad and corny"
2,Unfortunatly this CD is very unoriginal.,"I am a great Li Wen fan. I have every CD. So don't go bashing me. But come on let's be honest. This album sucks. I don't like any song here (maybe wherever you go) Of all the albums on amazon Didadi is the only one that should be bought. You and me isn't that great either. Coco is just following whatever is popular at the time. (dance, latin etc) Doesn't have any identity.Her old ones are on a totally differnet level compared to this bomb. The only reason I treasure this CD/ALBUM is that I got it autographed when she came here several years ago. Oh and I also hate the album photos. Who took those shots? Geez."
2,Mostly unfulfilling with filler,"It seems like most of the songs from CoCo Lee's US debut ""Just No Other Way"" were rejects that werern't put on Jennifer Lopez' album ""On The 6"". Thank God for that! CoCo even used some of the same producers that Jennifer used (a la Ric Wake). Other than the standout track and first single, ""Do You Want My Love"" (produced by one of my favorite house remixers, Frankie Knuckles), the rest of the songs are really filler. And a guest appearance by Kelly Price on this album isn't going to help make this album any better.I don't think Sony really marketed this album well enough before it was released. They should have at least allowed ""Do You Want My Love"" some major radio airplay and maybe some heavy video rotation on MTV. They could've even released ""Do You Want My Love"" as a commercial single before releasing the album. All in all, ""Just No Other Way"" isn't going to get far and it's just going to be another album with almost no worth or creativity in it."
2,Not her best work,"Coco Lee *can* sing. However, I don't understand how we're supposed to figure that out on this sugar-coated, overly-synthesized, horribly-written album. You'd think that Sony would have had the savvy to realize that this cheesy pop stuff (it's NOT R&B! ) would not be recevied well in the US. I wish Ms. Lee the best of luck and I hope that Sony will give her another chance at the US market -- maybe next time she'll be able to work on material that doesn't make me want to curl under my bed and scream."
2,sounds the same like all the others!,"This is not bad, but not too good either. I'd rather spend $35 on Faye Wong's cd and love all the songs than to spend about $15 to buy a cd that sounds so similar to all the others.--U want something worth your $$? Try Faye Wong."
4,COCO PAVING THE WAY FOR OTHER CHINESE SINGERS,"Lemme tell you guys the truth. I only bought the CD to support CoCo, since I luv all of Chinese CDs, and I bought it to still give sum faith for CoCo. I'm only 12, and lemme tell you, this CD is reely worth buying! Not only does it have beautiful lyrics, catch melodies, but CoCo has put a lot of effort into the singing, and it has certainly showed! I'm Chinese, and I think CoCo is paving a way for other Chinese singers to become famous not only in the US, but worldwide. People such as Jacky Cheung, VaLen Hsu, yuki hsu, and David Tao will guaranteed become reely famous here. In JUST NO OTHER WAY, I realy liked all the songs. They all had their individual specialty and were all good listening to. The only song I didn;t reely like was #9, Don't You Want Mah Love. Maybe the song titles could have differed a little, I admit, but overall it really is a good CD."
2,Nothing special,"Sure, it's good to see an Asian artist trying to break into the U.S. barrier, but this album won't do it. I have nothing against Coco, she has a nice voice, and while this cd somewhat demonstrated that with interesting voice ranges, it's not something to cling on. Coco's style is not very eccentric to be noticed really. Her music is R&B/POP, a dying and yet overrated market. If you want to listen to some backed washed familiar forgetful pop, this isn't a bad choice. It won't leave much affect though."
4,a pretty good one,Hi folks ! Just wanted to share my thoughts about this cd with you. This cd is a good start to enter the english spoken market. I really enjoy listening to it (for the first time I can understand all of the lyrics ;-)). And of course CoCo has got a great voice ! Nevertheless I must admit that some of her Mandarin cds (for example DiDaDi or Sunny Day) are better than this one - that's why it's only a four star rating.
5,Album of the Year!,"I don't know why a lot of you are putting Coco's new album ""Just No Other Way"" down? This album's got variety of styles (R&B, pop...). I think this is one of the best albums produced this year not to mention that she has a great voice and an amazing singing skill! I am personally a big fan of Mariah Carey as well, but don't you all agree that ""Just No Other Way"" is a much better one than Mariah's ""Rainbow"" album?"
2,Boring.,"I'm afraid the performance is neither interesting nor passionate. The story is contrived and incredible. After reading several disappointing books with raving reviews, I'm getting wary about buying books which are written by relatively new and unknown wirters."
4,Thin plot but great characters,"I have read several of Ms Leon's Venice based mysteries. I have never visited Venice, but find her descriptions of life there to be very satisfying! Her Inspector Brunetti is also satisfyingly drawn with a typical family and interesting perspectives on Italian government and society.I am a big fan of David Hewson's Nic Costa mysteries which also based in Italy and several in Venice. Hewson's work is somewhat richer, but a little bizarre.Both provide in-depth perspectives on Italian life that I find fascinating."
3,The Real Venice,"To be brutally honest: as a mystery novel, this is sub-par. It flounders around for almost two hundred pages where nothing much happens to advance the plot. As a glimpse into the mindset of Venetians, it was excellent. This is no gleaming Disney fantasy of sunken palazzos and romantic singing gondoliers - workaday Venice is a cold, gray, cynical place.Brunetti is struggling to do an honest job as a police investigator despite incompetence and corruption. His world is dominated by a public distrustful of the government, divided by classism, jaded by endless greed and collusion, and surprisingly, with a social stigma toward people with disabilities.No doubt these books aren't very popular with American readers - there is no Scooby Doo moment at the end where everything is tied up in a neat little bow. More time is spent on socio-political dissatisfaction than the mystery - however, as a lover of Italy, I look forward to reading more by this author."
2,This Book is where Leon starts losing it,"I bought all the Brunetti books through The Girl of His Dreams at one time (having just discovered the novels) and from Uniform Justice on, they get progressively worse. Leon has become wildly anti-American to the point of absurdity, pulling out every sterotype imaginable. Plus she focuses on the environment to the extent of forgetting what sort of book she is writing. Once, for a theme, is fine; time after time is just distracting. But most of all, from this novel on, she forgets that books must have an ending. From Uniform Justice through the next six books I read, she has no sense of justice and the books essentially end with the rich and powerful literally getting away with murder. Once, like in Uniform Justice, okay, but enough is enough. No matter how much Brunetti is a compelling character, his wife has turned into a nutter and the books are depressing. Read the series through Wilful Behavior, then stop."
2,Another disappointment,"This is the third and last of her books I will read. The other two were not all that intriguing and the endings were disappointing. At the end the question in you mind was: 'That's it? That's all there is to this?'This one was different. It is one of those books that keeps you up at night because you want to read a few more pages before turning out the lights. But then you reach the end and you are appalled. I won't give away the ending but it will offend your sense of justice.Donna Leon's books have two parts. One part is the mystery. That is fiction. The second part is about Italy. Because of her extensive experience there, that is fact. The picture of the venality and corruption she paints in her books has taken some of the shine off the impression I got from a three-week tour in 2012.I wanted to go back but now I'm not so sure I will."
3,Uniform Justice,I did not like the ending. No justice was served to the murderers or the schoolI felt the story getting weak towards the end.
4,A Web of Political Corruption,"The military, and political corruption are the targets in Commissario Brunetti's twelfth outing. Once again there is the lovely backdrop of Venice - that city of contradictions, yet it seems with each Brunetti novel Venice as a character is fading more and more. I wish Leon would bring it back to prominence. Although the 'whodunit' here is not difficult to guess, the ending still comes as a surprise. One of the pleasures of the Brunetti novels is in watching the workings of his mind, and how he deals with moral ambiguities, and those ambiguities are at the heart of this novel. Another pleasure is seeing the role his family plays as he solves the puzzle. His wife Paola is as integral to these books as Brunetti himself. The Brunetti novels are way above what one finds in other mysteries these days, and is highly recommended. However, I could have done without the presence of the author's subtle and not so subtle jibes at politics in the United States."
2,a political platform,"I was rather disappointed by this book. The mystery starts off as rather interesting, but one sees the solution quite early on. What gets very tiresome is the continuous political preaching. Ms Leon is entitled to her opinions, and I do not mind their being mentioned occasionally under the guise of a character's beliefs. But this was really too much: it is supposed to be a mystery, not a political platform."
4,Another Venetian winner,"Donna Leon has done it again. Yet another masterpiece. Few writers are so adept at describing the uniqueness of the locations where their stories are set. Moreover, she writes well about corruption endemic in Italian politics. We can see how a person such as Silvio Berlusconi can become Prime Minister in spite of his his many ""crimes""."
4,Great Series,"I did not feel this book was as good as others. However, this is still one of the best series I've read in a long time. The writing has reminded consistently good, unlike the Anne Perry series in which the writing deminished to such a level that I can no longer read her booksAlso, has anyone noticed that the books seem to get more and more cynical as the series moves forward -- Patta gets dumber and Venice and Italy more corrupt?S"
1,Terrible,This book was so disappointing. Leon writes fairly well but she yearns to write a political commentary more then a murder mystery. In her anti-american/anti-military bias she makes her chararcters look ignorant and provencial. Look elsewhere for a compelling mystery.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"In all, this is at best a mediocre afternoon TV movie or a straigt to DVD release. How did the film ever win the awards indicated on the cover? The latter by the way, unlike the flick, looks promising. The film has an innane plot that is banal to the max, pretentious even. The acting is flaky (yes, even Dee Wallace Stone and Udo Kier). There is a russian scientist/doctor who has such an unnatural russian accent, the unwitting may have thought they are watching a monty-python moment, really the segment was a hoot! Note - this film intends to be serious and gripping, not farsical. The special effects are creature of the black lagoon standard and the overall pace is erratic. Why waste resources and make a film like this? Actually, the discerning would have gotten a bad vibe right from the start when the credits appeared. No self-respectable fim maker would have approved the cheesy and annoying static effects, CHEAP!"
3,CEREBRAL HORROR,"For a low budget indie, HEADSPACE isn't all that bad..unfortunately, it's not all that good either...but it maintained my interest and relies on atmospheric spookiness most of the time with a few scenes of gory terror. Although it's plot is sometimes nebulous, it is a psychological thriller focusing on ""links"" between our world and the ""netherworld."" Christopher Denham is very good as Alex, a young man plagued with horrific visions, headaches and the incredible gift of an almost photographic memory. His search to find out what's wrong with him leads him to a superior chess player, a sympathetic psychiatrist AND murderous demons.Veteran performers Olivia Hussey, William Atherton, Udo Keir, Dee Wallace Stone and Mark Margolis are along for the ride and ultimately contribute to a better than average if not great thriller."
2,"No suspense, no scares, lots of cliches","The family dog is mutilated. The family is in danger so they jump into their truck to escape and it won't start. Two horror movie cliches within the first 5 minutes of the movie. I should have just turned it off and saved my time.Alex is a 25 year old whose intellect begins to grow by leaps and bounds. He can read entire books in seconds and remember everything he's read. He teaches himself to be a chess master in a matter of days. He also sees creatures in his dreams that begin to come to life, murdering people Alex has come into contact with. He goes to friends and doctors searching for answers to what is happening to him.The box made Head Space sound interesting but it wasn't. This was 90 turgid minutes of middling acting and bad plotting. The makeup on the creatures was ok. This movie wasn't exciting, suspenseful or scary."
3,The Playaz Court is a really great buy.,"I recently saw a post on [web address] about this movie by a fellow member on the board (I am a writer as well). And I wanted to show my support and went out and bought a copy. This movie is really good. I didn't get bored like I do in a lot of films that aren't big time productions. I loved the movie, the plot, the dialogue was excellent. I would recommend this to anyone. This is how you make a movie. You don't need all the flash and cash. Great actors, great director, but above all, a great script is all you need. Wonderful movie. Looking forward to seeing more!"
3,disappointing,A bit disappointed in the quality of the orchestral arrangements. Not my favorite c.d.
4,Excellent comforter!,"This oversize queen comforter is excellent for wintertime use. I'm not sure it will work for me in the summertime, as I find myself getting hot in the middle of a Michigan winter's night (I keep my room in the low 60's at night, and find this is perfect for such a temperature). The high thread count is nice, although a bit useless, since to maintain the warranty, you're required to have a cover on. The fill hasn't leaked out, and the baffle stitching keeps the fill from shifting out of place. This comforter comes with a ""breathable"" zippered bag for off-season storage.This is a quality product that should last you for years to come!"
1,DON'T BELIVE THE HYPE,"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT. THE MOST OVERRATED CD TO COME OUT TO DATE! IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT IT, I SUGGEST EVERYBODY SEND BACK THE CD TO THE RECORD COMPANY AND ASK FOR THERE MONEY BACK CAUSE IT'S GARBAGE! DON'T GET ME WRONG MOS DEF IS NICE, BUT THE NEW STUFF HE'S TRYING TO BRING OUT IS NOT HIP HOP/RAP."
3,"Expected better, but still decent, 3.5","Not much to say here, Mos Def is back, with good stuff, but not as a majority.Still, if you ask yourself ""is this worth buying?"" well, if you love Mos Def, yes it is. If you sorta dig Mos Def, yes it is. If you think he's okay, no, it's not. It's much better than Kweli's latest work, I don't know what happened. I think their needs to be a Black Star reunion to get their eyes of the stardom."
2,Mos Def,"Mos Def is one of the most musically talented individuals in the game today, but what happen to lines like ""lyrically handsome""? New Danger is really different when compared to other Mos Def albums. I think Mos Def is trying to bring a new element of jazz/rock into his beats. Some of it works, but most of it did not. I think I will have to listen to it more to really appreciate what Mos Def is trying to convey. But from what I heard, I am a little disappointed."
3,One Word- Unique,"Mos Def has some great songs including Sex, Love & Money, Close Edge & Champion Requiem. Unfortunately the whole album is not at all like those and it is just not my cup of tea. If you like blues guitar with R&B and weird screaming in areas then the rest of the album is for you. Me, I just like Mos Def the rapper and he would make some great albums if he would just stick to rapping."
3,Mos Def a decent CD,"If you are disappointed with the ridiculous pop genre hip hop has become, then buy this album.I seriously laugh out loud at the satirical elements this CD has."
3,"IGNORE MY RATING, MEANS NOTHING","i'm not giving the new danger a rating cause i have no opinion of it. i listen to hip hop. i don't listen to rock, this is rock. theres nothing wrong w/ that, mos is god and i respect whatever choices he makes cause it's good 4 him. it's just that i don't listen to rock. i also feel that mos is kinda abandoning his loyal fans by switching genres. please mos, come back. i'll let common sense speak 4 me: if i don't like it i don't like it that don't mean that i'm hatingholla if ya hear me"
2,Hurt Feelings,"I've been there with Mos from the beginning. I'm extremely disappointed in this jambalaya album. Do not buy this album. We can't encourage this kind of behavior from our better hip-hop artists. There is only one Andre. Advice to MD, get back to hip-hop. It needs you. Don't ever push Rock & Roll on us again. I'm just so disappointed.P.S. Minnesota is not new to the game....check Money Boss Players from the mid 90's. Minne's been layin it down for a long time."
2,WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!,"I REALLY LOVE MOS, BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM. THERE ARE 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS ON THIS SELL-OUT FEELING ALBUM. THE SONG WRITING LACKS THE SUBSTANCE, AND DEPTH THAT MOS FANS MAY BE USED TO. THE CONSTANT REPEATING OF; YEAH YEAH, UH COME ON UH, LEAVES ME WONDERING WHERE ARE THE LYRICS? IF YOU LOVE THE THINGS THAT SEPERATED MOS DEF FROM STANDARD HIP HOP DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."
5,Mos Amazing,Mos Def has taken RAP to a new level. New Danger is nothing you would expect from Mos Def....... MOS AMAZINGGREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com
2,"Mos Def is one of my favorite rapper, used to be.","I never expect that I will get sleepy while I'm listening a mos def album,I know he wanna make a diffecence music,he want to make some brand new stuff that the world never heard before,but it's a flop....I buy this album without listen,because itrust and love mos def,but I'm disappointed!"
3,Who is he?,"I'm a big Mos Def fan, I bought Black on both Sides 5 times. This albumn is good but I can't tell if he is hip hop, a rock star or the artist Prince. Definitely different and better than the Young Buck/Lloyd Banks crap out there though."
1,Mos Defnately Not,"Like the saying goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure. In light of that theme, let me just state that Mos Def's trash is most definately not my treasure. If I could give this album negative stars I would but alas, Amazon won't allow for that. Just because Mos is trying to break through and/or meld different genres of music together doesn't mean that it works. Just because it's something that hasn't been heard before doesn't mean that it deserves to be heard, and while I appreciate his ambition, I don't appreciate this nonsense from an artist I have loved, respected, and admired since Black Star hit the scene. These words can't even express how disappointed I am that I spent my hard-earned $15 on this mind-numbingly ridiculous collection of notes that tries to pass off as music. If you're feenin' for some real hip hop, get De La Soul's ""Grind Date."""
3,cold and experimental,"Mos Def's debut album moved me deeply. Not only was it a warm album with a lot of wit and emotion, it was also funky and mellow. This new effort is too self-consciously experimental. A bad move. I'm not feeling it at all. The first few tracks sounds like a jam session from a bunch of stoned students. And what's with the rock music and hard-ass militant attitude? The joy of the first album was that it was funny, clever, sensitive - friendly and warm - yeah I said it - friendly and sunny. Not many MCs these days dare to open up and show the sensitive side. Mos Def did - but now those days are gone. This album is just cold and experimental - or trying desperately to fit into that jittery, minimal modern R&B sound that will get a hit on MTV. So Mos Def has lost his way, along with Common. At least we've still got Talib Kweli and Guru producing good material."
4,Mighty Mos Deffffffffinatly,"Alot of times you really can't tell what an album is like simply from the Amazon reviews that are posted. I have made the mistake several times and bought or not bought CD's based on these descriptions. In this case...the last few reviews are right on. This showing from Mos Def is very different than Black on Both Sides. So don't expect an all out hip hop album. Mos Def brings a different element to his fans and I can appreciate him for that. However, I would be lying if I said that I didn't miss his old style. Also, I was a little disappointed with the track ""CLOSE EDGE"". I first heard this track on the Dave Chappelle show. It actually sounded better live than it does in the recording studio.In summary...this disc should defffffinatly be in your collection. If not...you are missing out on the evolution of Hip Hop."
4,Let an artist create!,"I am tired of reading reviews from so-called ""die-hard"" fans of artists who, when the new album doesn't sound exactly like the last one, are quick to dis what the artist has done. I commend Mos Def for making this album because it does tread on some risky ground for a ""rapper."" It is obvious that Mos is growing as a musician and a lyricist. If you are looking for another ""Black on Both Sides,"" or ""Black Star,"" I suggest buying those albums again. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the growth shown on this album and allow yourself to experience something that bends genres, expectations, and all labels. Sort of like Mos himself. Peace."
4,Solid sophomore outing,"Very pleased with this one. Haven't completely absorbed it, as I've listened to it a few times at this writing, but I can already tell it's very solid. Denifinately a lot better than most of the music released. Very heady and deep. I love the message the mighty Mos Def is trying to convey. Didn't give it a perfect five stars because of its raw edge in parts; but that's also what makes it so endearing. Have seen some reviews that state this record is boring and strays too far from hip-hop. It really reminds me of his first solo album in its originality musically, however. If you don't like hip-hop at all, this probably won't change your mind. If you have an open mind to anything, like me, you will probably enjoy this. Hope it doesn't take another five years to acquire another orignal album, Mos!"
4,A concept album in hip-hop??? Imagine that....,"This album rocks, If you like MosDef get it. If you like K-os get it. If you like Common, The Roots get it. If you think hip-hop is only four dimensional ie; emcee-deejay-beeboyee-writers - grow up. This is grown man bizzness. Play it loud, play it from start to finnish. It looks like hip-hop dun grown up. I think it's about time.PS. The guitar, if you old school boys can remember, founded the sound of hip-hop. Back to the essence yet right on top of thingsremember RUNDMC? Public Enemy?, Damn, the Beastie Boys did it in 92 - Check your head you wack MosDef fans who gave it one star - go home and listen to it again '....you know I got cha'/ know I got cha'...'"
2,Hit&Miss,"this Album is closer to a 2&half for me.I applaud Mos Def's ability to Channel in many various Musical Sources for this set. Problem is while He can play different Instruments He also trys to take on to many roles as a Artist. you are left with a Set that while it has upside it also has downside.I think if this set had have dropped 3-4 years back the Buzz would be stronger&I beleive the Set would have been seen on point with what He was trying to do with His Black Jack Johnson Project.""Black on Both Sides"" is a Good Set this set could have been even better with trimming some things off&If it had have dropped a few years back.alot of interesting ideas but alot also taking up space.""The Rape Over"" is a tight cut."
4,Finally!,"I'm a little shocked to see all these reviews saying that rappers aren't supposed to rock or sing. What the hell? Mos has been touring with a rock band for over three years now, and songs like ""Kalifornia"" he's put out for soundtracks and compilations have been devoid of the typical beats+rhymes formula.Mos is actually a better singer than rapper. The guy has got mad talent. New Danger has more emotion than any other album I've heard in a while. I like that Mos Def and Andre 3000 have decided to make good music instead of what they think is going to fit in on the radio. (...) Cop this."
1,MOS dissapointing,"This was my most anticipated album of 2004. I have to say thatit floped.....I've been a mos def and talib kweli ( blackstar ) fan for years. Im love thier style and the way they took hip hop back to the roots. Im all for being creative and exploring new sounds, but what i dont understand is why change a good thing if your gonna mess it up. When i purchased this album i wanted REAL HIP HOP not this mix of rock/hip-hop style that mos def has choosen to use. To me this was just a marketing gimic used to expand fan base. To me Mos def is one of the most talanted men in HIP HOP .... I wish he showed his skillz on this album.I just wanted to add that the TALIB KWELI album THE BEAUTIFUL STRUGGLE is definatly the best album of 2004."
3,Don't expect Black on Both sides.,"This is a very good album. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because its not really my style. As I suspected before purchase there is just way too much rock and other elements. I am a hip hop junky, and this album was not the 'fix' I was looking for. That said, Mos shows his skill and creativity and I have a ton of respect for him following a different path in music. There are some really good songs, Sunshine being my favorite, which takes things back to the more straightforward hip hop I'm used to from Mos. If you like his song ""rock and roll"" from the Black on Both Sides lp, then this is definitely up your alley. I'll give this one a chance and keep it spinning for now, but it doesn't approach the amazing emceeing I'm used to from Mos' previous work. Worth a shot."
1,Delusions of grandeur,"Attention, cd buyers, there's a ""New Danger"" in the world today: once-great MC's making horrible albums.I wanted to like Mos Def's album The New Danger. I really did. He was great in Black Star, great in his debut Black on Both Sides, and generally great on his guest appearances on other songs. However, this New Danger is a colossal failure.Half of the songs are not even songs at all. Most of the album is just Mos Def talking/ trying to sing over a good beat. The songs generally go nowhere.This album is 100% pure ego. It is Mos Def trying to make an epic album to span all of musickind.Hands down, this is one of the most annoying, disappointing, irritating albums I have ever heard - and I've heard a LOT of CD's in my time.Please don't believe any of these five star ""absolute classic"" reviews."
4,solid CD,"A new sound for Mos, worth the money if your interested in somthing new. heres the good songs on the cd:-Sex, Love and Money-Grown Man Business-Ghetto Rock-Life Is Real-Champion Requiem-The Rape Over"
3,Good but not what I expected,"mos def is one of my favourite artists, i understand that he wanted to experiment with this album, and that's ok but it's not what hip hop needs right now. with so many generic, fake ass mc's out right now mos needed to come with a real HIP HOP album and try to save the industry. anyway this is still good. i didn't like it at first but after a few listens it grew on me. it is not like black star or black on bith sides but is still a decent album. maybe next time we'll hear mos flowing over some good beatspeace"
3,it's hard to be different,"I listened to this once when I first bought it , a few times after that , it's good to hear something experimental , but it doesn't mean it's always a good thing , this cd pulls you in a lot of different directions it's a strong effort , but will be forgotten , mos is the mos talented mc I've ever hear in my entire life listening to hip hop , the match of the music is correct sometimes he needs a louder sound because his voice is so dynamic it cuts trough the track , it's worth a listen if you want to hear something different . check it out . but by far not a classic."
3,Wack on both sides,"Ever since I heard Mos Def on De La's Stakes IS High I have been impressed by his flow, mic control and subject matter. Black on both sides was a classic I still bump to this day. Fast forward to five years later to New Danger. I have been looking forward to this album for about two years. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I hear many people giving artist props by saying their music is ""different"". But different doesn't mean it's tight!!(with the exception of Outkast) There's an old saying ""If it ain broke then don't try to fix it."" Mos stick to ripping the mic."
4,Mos Different,"From the beginning, you know that you're in for something different. Mos Def delivered on this one. This is not for those who have no tolerance of diversity in what they want in hip hop. Dabbling in jazz, rock, funk, blues, soul and hip hop, The New Danger is just that--New and Dangerous. The Rape Over (which is not long enuff), Sunshine, Grown Man Business and War are my favorites. And don't sleep on Modern Marvel, a nine minute tribute to the legendary Marvin Gaye. Please support this brotha so we get more hip hop like this."
3,Greatness From Mos,"This album is grown, poetic and sexy although it isn't on the same level as Black on Both Sides its still hott but then again mos is hott I luv his lyrical genius"
5,Good Experimental Hip Hop,"Mos Def's second cd is a true classic. He does an experimental hip hop album that pushes the boundaries. This album has it all. Hip Hop, R&B, Rock, etc. I think people should show respect to an artist who would push the boundaries instead of just sticking to the formula. Favorites include Boogie Man Song, Ghetto Rock, Zimzallabim, The Rape Over, Sex, Love & Money, Sunshine, War, Modern Marvel, The Beggar, and Champion Requiem. Pick up a copy of this album. Recommended."
5,A man of all arts and sides,"I know a lot of people are not feeling what Mos has done on this album . Most people are so stuck on him doing one style that they are not opening themselves up to dealing with more than just his side of hip hop and what he has sone with Talib .I love this album , i can't not listen to this album at least twice a day. It shows so much of how one type of music can marry into another and have a sound that is as unexplainable as hip hop use to be.This album is wonderful ... but only if you open up your mind to the possibilites to how far music has come and where it is going."
1,This album sucks,"Terrible let down. Nothing really more to say about it, stear clear of this one like the plague."
3,not worth 5 stars,"im a big mos fan. I like that he touched on different elements on this album and you have to give credit where credit is due. but at the same time you have to do it right. i wasn't feeling the cheesy distorted guitar, or for the production in general for the most part. kanye puts down a pretty dope beat, that reminds you that mos' does actually rap over hip hop beats.Im a big blackstar fan and i think kweli's and mos' album show, that they do better as a team."
3,still trying to listen to it,"i really like mos def, but i'm not sure about this one. i've had it since it came out but i haven't really listened to it really good. i like him as an artist, so i'll really have to try again with this one."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"This album was sadly disappointing. Quoting Jay-Z, ""what more can I say?"".... Mos Def's newest album ""New Danger"" has fallen victuim to a TERRIBLE sophomore slump! I waited fro this album with great anticipation, knowing that Mos was a great lyrical artist. He is a part of the great hip hop group BlackStar, whose lyrics are only rivaled by maybe a Nas or 2 Pac. I thought this album would be great, sh** was I wrong! I wasn't even close, this album was so weak. Every track seemed to be rock-ish, I wan't sure if I was listening to Mos Def or AC/DC. Talib Kweli's album was far FAR better than Mos Def's. I think i was being kind giving this album 2 stars... i think it was out of respect of what he's done in the past. Mos better step it up on his next album, because Kweli is blowing up, and I like Mos Def too much to see him living in the shadow of Kweli's fame."
1,worst pile of poo ever,"I loved the black star cd - 5 stars, I really liked black on both sides 4 stars but if I could give this 0 stars I would.This is garbage. Mos is trying to channel dead jazz and blues stars and be them, not himself. This is no rap cd. so if u are looking for him to rap, do not buy this .again to make clear I am a fan of his earlier stuff, I have seen him and kweli in concert.but this album is a pile of dog doo."
1,Im Sorry I Bought This,"This Is Mos Def's Worst album to date, I don't know what the mission of this album was to fulfill. It had songs where sometiems mos def sung over a rock song, songs where he was singing, and songs where he was trying to accomplish reggae. This album was most likely experimental and it blows, mos raps on about 7 tracks which are the only good songs on the cd, he doesn't go back to the basic soul hip-hop like on Black On Both Sides Which is a great album. I don't know what mos was smoking when he made this and i hope it never happens again."
2,Identity Crisis,"There are a few tracks on this Cd that are pretty tight - but there are some where it's not at all classic Mos Def. I have his black on both sides as well as the 4 CD pack made by Sattan (not available worldwide) and this new CD is totally off, with a lot of rock incorporated for no reason - where Mos is screaming throughout the songs. Just meaningless yelling. And there's even a song that he produced that is all music - rock music - and he doesn't even rap at all. It just seems like he's trying to be too creative and not holding on to his roots."
2,Far safer than the name implies,"Mos Def can flow like no other as tracks like Close Edge demonstrate. Unfortunately, that track is a gem surrounded by tired, rap-rock garbage. I guess for some that's a good thing, but for me, blaaaah."
2,People are being dishonest if they say this album is dope,"I'm a SUPA DUPA Mos Def fan (I even like Mos Def BETTER than Talib Kweli!!!)...but you gotta be an official d*** rider to like ""this"" album. This album is HORRIBLE!!! Don't get me wrong...there are a ""FEW"" hot joints on this album (not enough to ""save"" the album though), but if you don't like to waste money...I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that you give this album a listen BEFORE buying it. If you don't know much about Mos Def, then DONT buy this album...get the ""Black Star"" album and/or the ""Black On Both Sides"" album instead. Those are SURE shots."
1,WHY IS EVERYONE BITING THEIR TONGUE???,"This was a disappointment Sophomore solo CD for Mos Def and at times very annoying. Everyone knows that Mos can go with the best of em and is probably one of the top ten MC's in the game today, however you wouldn't know this by listening to this CD. Let me just ask all of the people that gave this CD a 4 or 5 star rating, If you had never heard of Mos Def and you brought this as his first release, would you honestly give it a 4 or 5 start rating... I THINK NOT!!!"
1,"Garbage, garbage and more garbage","Mos Def spends a good portion of this album making gripes about something or another.Here is my gripe to Mos Def, thanks for wasting my $15 with this crap album.Now Mos Def not only makes bad movies, but bad albums too."
1,Message to Ziggy,Your feelings seem to be hurt that this album was not enjoyed. Everyone has the right to their own opinion. You must be a girl or want to be a girl. Stop crying like a little hctib.!!!
4,Not a complete Sophomore slump,"For those looking for another 'Black on Both Sides' this isn't it. This is a hip hop, blues, jazz, rock album in the truest sense. If he had excluded the pure rock tracks, not even replacing them, alot of the disappointed fans would be more receptive of this work. With 18 tracks there's enough to choose from to mix and match your favorite songs. It's much better to have those rock tracks than the skits that often lace the CDs of his contemporaries.From the soulful Boogie Man Song to the Kanye produced Sunshine to the pure-rap Champion Requiem, there are many gems. The misses include the very unimpressive Blue Black Jack and the annoying The Easy Spell.Overall, I'd recommend to Mos Def fans and those who have a taste for various music types."
5,NICE WORK,"WHEN I FIRST HERD THE MOS DEF CD I WAS BLOWN AWAY BECUASE I COULD'T BELIEVE THAT HE PUT ON THOSE DIFFERNT ELEMENTS INTO IT HE AS SOME BLUES, ROCK AND ROLL SOME POETRY HIP HOP AND HE SINGS ON SOME TRACK AND THINK THIS CD IS GOOD, IT'S A MORE MUTRE SOUND, SO KIDS IF YOU JUST NOW GETTING TURNED ON TO MOS, YOU MAY HAVE TO GO BACK TO BLACK ON BOTH SIDE, BECUASE THIS ALBUM IS REAL CREATIVE, BUT HE IS A TRUE ARTIST. THANK YOU MOS."
4,It Really Isn't A Bad Album,"Everywhere I turn there's people spitting on this album. It's NOT Black on Both Sides, but it doesn't suck. Let me put it this way; if you enjoyed Common's Electric Circus, then you'll like this. And I for one loved Electric Circus. This is different and set apart from the norm. I recommend it to give your ears a break from monotony. Get it."
2,"ehh,,,take a pass","I have to say that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. I was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one"
3,3.5 Cool Stars,"I'll be listening to this album for quite a while, if only to completely figure it out. But, that's a good thing in modern hip-hop. Although, this really isn't a hip-hop album or maybe it is...or maybe it isn't. Bottom line, it's damn interesting, and compelling at that, unlike the vast majority of the nonsense that continuously gets released on Tuesdays these days. I must admit that I've been anticipating Mos Def's latest joint for a minute. I heard that he came off-key on this album as far as hip-hop goes, but I had no idea that he would twist the game so tight. All-in-all, I'm really digging this joint. I like the fusion of jazz, rock, and soul. When Mos spits pure hip-hop, he's a sharp as they come. As for his far-out side, well, dude is way out there, but he's sonic and quite groovy. No, he can't really sing, but he is soulful, and when you're as multi-talented as he is, this type of stuff will invariably be evaluated on a genius level."
4,Interesting even to a nonhistorian,"I caught this on PBS, intending to tape it for someone else, and ended up watching it myself and enjoying it! I am not a history/politics person, and I still found it good. At times the Churchill actor sitting at his desk and smoking annoyed me, but there was still lots of original footage to keep it visually interesting."
1,Loud and annoying sounds & broke first day,"Bought this backhoe at Target last night. This morning, my son found it and was so excited. Very difficult to unpack. Had to use my electric screwdriver to take off 8 screws from bottom of packaging. The noises that the toy made irritated my son, and he asked me to remove the batteries (4 AA batteries). We have many battery operated toys that make noises, but this one is particularly obnoxious.Took the toy out to the sandbox today at the park, and son played with it about 5 minutes, then went on to other activities. It still had a tag on the lever reading ""pull to activate."" I pulled and the small plastic lever cracked. I noticed the whole toy was stiff and the buckets hardly moved at all, perhaps because of the plastic plates on sides that appear to have been added for finger protection. In any case, this toy was a major disappointment, and am returning to store tomorrow."
3,"Eh, its ok.","All plastic, not thrilled with it. I got a truck for him too that was from a different maker and much better quality. He does play with this sometimes, but likes the truck mnuch more."
2,"Somewhat informative, but not the best","I've been spending the past few weeks studying for the GRE. I've read the majority of the books out there that tell how to study for the exam. And I've found that the Arco book is not very good. While it may have numerous practice problems, it does not contain very much information about how to solve the problems. For example, when it comes to antonyms, the book suggests that if you don't know the meaning of a word, click (C) and move on. I advise reading the Kaplan book. It was by far the most informative of the lot."
2,Just to practice,This is not a study guide by any stretch of the imagination. Go through the practice exams and discard. CD-ROM is a nice addition.
3,My comments,"I think it is good practice book. Give you a lots of exams, but i agree that it does have many errors."
4,Enigma,"Enigma is a very interesting look at code breaking and espionage in Britain during World War II. The two main stars, Dougray Scott and KateWinslet do a wonderful job of portraying two intelligence people whouncover clues that lead to the breaking of the German Enigma machine whichhad been used to encrypt German messages between submarines. There isaction interspersed with suspense and a great supporting cast. I highlyrecommend it."
4,very good,I would've liked it more if they included more about the codebreaking and less about the romance. Obviously Katie was either pregnant or overweight by 30 lbs and looked nothing like the cover art.
3,Enigmatic Urban Legend,"I am not sure why people like this movie so much. It is a bit confusing as there are actually two separate plot lines going on at the same time. The actors and actresses try hard and do very well, but the characterizations are unreal. It is hard to imagine the mathematicians at Benchely Park could be so down-to-earth and humane as portrayed in the movie. I suppose there are shades of Alan Turing in Tom Jericho's character, but it is rather difficult to envision a mathematician being an action hero. The handling of codebreaking is a lot better than ""A Beautiful Mind"", though."
2,Could be better,"A film trying to emulate the best of Hitchcock, doesn't quite succeed. The plot doesn't make 100 percent sense. A reasonbly ordinary man is caught up in great events. He is charged with solving two mysteries: what happened to Clair and breaking a new German code. Somehow he manages to solve both mysteries at the same time. The best parts of the film are the police interrogations. Those scenes are crisp and dramatic. Wait for the DVD."
1,Horrible Video,"As noted in other reviews, the video quality of this dvd is horrible. Not to mention, the movie is a bit slow."
3,"Not bad, but the real facts are far more compelling than ENIGMA was.","Sorry....but when you know history,it is difficult to engross yourself in a film,albeit a good one,that is so full of inaccuracies.I commend Tom Stoppard and Michael Apted (whose recent AMAZING GRACE is a wonderful and reasonably accurate account of the 18th -Century Slave Trade) for doing their part to shed light on the Bletchley Park Codebreakers,but this film really is just loosely based on the facts.You will get a sense of the time period,and some government intrigue,but turning the real-life Alan Turing into Jericho was a bit much.Turing's real life personal drama was far more compelling than this film decided to reveal.I recommend the film BREAKING THE CODE (with Derek Jacobi) and BREAKING THE CODES (DVD set) in order to round out the knowledge of the Enigma decipherers."
5,Terrific historical thriller!!,"I live in Germany and so was able to see this at a theatre in Frankfurt which shows movies in their original English versions (which is perfect since I don't speak a lick of German and would also like to hear the original voices of these high-paid stars). The show was great! I didn't have many expectations but the acting was superb; Northam, Scott, and Winslet just made the movie. The settings were so very well done that I felt transported to that time and place. Its romantic and tragic with history and high drama. It never drags. One of the best movies I've seen in the past year."
5,"Enigma- Great Movie, Great Acting!","I saw this movie in the theater first and loved it and had to buy it on DVD. It is such a good story and the actors are great. Especially Dougray Scott, Jeremy Northam, and Kate Winslet!!"
3,Good WWII mystery,"The movie based on the Robert Harris book is quite intteresting and not at all predictable. Dougray Scott takes his three first names and breaks code for the British during World War II. His quest is to reveal whether his former lover used him to give information to the Nazis. Real life events play as a backdrop to characters trying to figure out who the good guys are. Kate Winslett plays the frumpy one this time, but she still looks cute if you watch closely. I liked it a great deal. The fine English actors rose it above the level that is usually expected in these films. The DVD, though, offered no goodies of any kind. A shame, because producer Mick Jagger is a total buff on World War II decoder machines. A documentary about how the real war was decoded would have been perfect."
5,No mystery why Enigma will entertain you,"Take a cast of Britian's best actors, add a dash of espionage with a touch of romance and you have the recipe for a fantastic thriller. ""Enigma"" starts slowly building it's characters up warts and all. The two mysteries encapsulated in the film slowly twist together to a dramatic, yet believable ending. For those of us addicted to suspense and mystery, ""Enigma"" is truely the elixur to cure our needs."
4,Tom Stoppard Story,"This movie was less about Enigma than it was about the main character's search for his lost love. The plot takes place at the WWII British decoding site and the race to find the new codes for the Enigma. The main character is a maverick whose extreme moodiness is a distraction for the viewer. Ultimately, the various plot twists do create a good story. Overall, the characters are rather superficial and yet the viewer is drawn into their interaction."
1,Leaves much to be desired.....,"After reading this book I was left with much dissappointment with Brown's description of ""sober living."" This books places a lot of emphasis on the negative and only briefly touches how truly wonderful living sober can be. Most information is slanted towards how difficult sobriety can be, and almost had me wondering why I didn't have many of the feelings and experiences she writes about. While there are twist and turns in sobriety, not all are negative. I would not recommend this book to a newly sober person as I feel it could perhaps have them questioning their own sobriety or worse, relapse."
4,This is a workout for the brain!,"The author starts out this book of logic puzzles with fairly easy stuff and moves the reader along so gradually that you are able to figure out solutions you never thought you could. But it gets REALLY complex toward the end and in fact lost me part of the time. So don't get too frustrated if you can't figure them all out. If you like logic puzzles, you don't want to miss this one."
1,A disappointing book,"I was very disappointed after browsing through a few chapters. For example the 2nd chapter, ""Ladies or tigers?"", is just way too easy and not much creativity is involved at all. Many puzzles are just some old junk. It's no fun to solve things like those."
5,"Good size, well printed, looks good.","A gift for my grand daughter, it seems to be a good book. I haven't heard her comments yet (it was a Xmas gift and she's still working through the rest of the gift pile)"
1,A Warning to Parents,"While this is a very high quality edition of the story of Pinocchio, I decided to return the book. Why? Because chapter 15 is entitled ""Pinocchio is hanged"" and includes an illustration of Pinocchio hanging by his neck from a tree with his hands tied behind his back. Although this may be true to the story of Pinocchio, I didn't feel that a book containing an illustration such as this is suitable for young children."
4,Well worth the money!,"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again. A few pages were damaged but I replaced them by finding a download of each page of this classic online. This is the real deal Pinocchio, not Walt Disney's version. It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!"
3,this ain't disney,"I read this book 20 years ago. I can still remember how convoluted the whole thing seemed to me when I was a child. This is the original Pinnochio story, upon which Disney based it's movie. In the book, Jimminy doesn't get past Chapter 3 as anything other than a ghost. The stories of Pinnochio turning into a donkey were very dark, and still leave me wondering about all the symbolism. If you think the story of Pinnochio can be summed up into a morality story about the perils of lying, you only know Disney. This is a book which is suitable for (my opinion) 12 through adult."
4,A great find,"I stumbled upon this album and immediately fell in love. The songs resonate in memory; the emotions expressed are universal experiences; the feeling way they're presented is unique. Nick Reifsteck has a rich baritone that has the same quality the great Ian Tyson possesses, evocative and lyrical. You can dance, you can just listen, you can cry--this album runs the gamut from giving opportunites to just get the old ya-yas out, or to reflect on the fools we all are for love."
2,If you like music.....!,"Like the previous reviewer, this film has haunted me since first seeing it at a Sacramento drive-in during the late 60's. But, not for the same reasons. The movie itself is interesting, but barely so. What is exceptional is the opening titles. A beautifully crafted montage showing the Monterey and Big Sur coastline while 's lush, haunting arrangements of ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" played in the background. WOW! Variations of the title theme are interwoven throughout the movie, making it a a worthwhile experience."
4,Liz Taylor Really Makes An Impression,"Whatever else you can say about this movie, Liz Taylor's presence in it makes all the difference. She was really a gorgeous woman in those days, and within the confines of the film, I thought her part was well-acted. That's not to say the film is believable, of course. But the movie is a great preservation (and reflection) of the culture of the sixties - in much the same way as another Burton film, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The Sandpiper is one of those movies that seems at first shallow and uninteresting, but then you can't stop watching it. Too bad it's not yet available on DVD."
2,the shadow of her smell,"ok, now THIS one is dick & liz at their most self-indulgent. even ""boom"" (not yet released on dvd, alas) is a better movie, if only because it is sooooo bad. it is amazing to realize that right after this, arguably her worst performance, taylor went on to give her best in ""virginia wolff"". i have given this a second star because the shorts about the making of the film (included on the dvd) are pretty interesting. only for dick & liz completists."
1,"Campy, like a mediocre SNL skit","The only thing in this film that has any merit is the exquisite cinematography, and musical score. So, if you'd like to get an eyeful of Big Sur go ahead and watch this movie. However, if you are looking for acting talent, good script, and meaningful story skip it! While some of the dialogue isn't so bad (it was a collaborative effort including the likes of Dalton Trumbo) coming out of Miss Taylor's mouth it is pure drivel. The film seems like a too long SNL skit. It's funny to think that Taylor and Burton were husband and wife at the time since there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between their characters. I so much agree with a previous reviewer who stated that in their next life they would like to come back as Miss Taylor's character and live in a beach house on Big Sur (talk about rich hippies)!"
5,The Sandpiper,"I've had the VHS of this timeless movie for a great number of years and all this time, when I saw other movies of both these actors were coming out in DVD I kept waiting and asking why this particular movie was not being sold alone.I love everything about it: the scenery (compared to what this area is at present), the clash of these two great actors and the never forgotten music."
4,About sandpiper,"Love Elizabeth Taylor, she is that much better with Richard Burton. What chemistry they had. Liked the story, it was a true life story that happens frequently."
4,The Sandpiper,"This one bought for a friend cannot comment too much but she liked it so I assume it was good.Again cannot submit without a certain amount of words, please change this format or I won't bother making the effort to do it."
5,One of my favorite love stories,"I was able to see this movie in high definition ON DEMAND USING XFINITY/COMCAST. The picture quality was equal to a Blu ray, however is was full screen. The movie titles were in 2.35 widescreen. NOW FOR THE QUESTION,SO................HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE TO CREATE A BLU RAY???????????"
1,Save your money,"This DVD was an almost complete waste of money. All it contains in a bunch of self-congratulatory young chefs running around frantically around a studio kitchen, and then eating their own cooking and praising their own abilities. There is very little to be learned on these DVDs. The one good bit was the chef making risotto, and it was good only for its comic effect, as he ran around the counter from pot to pot to pot. I don't think even an advanced chef has much to learn from this, and it's a total waste for a beginner. Instead, spend your money on DVDs by Julia Child or Lidia Bastianich or Jacques Pepin, chefs who actually teach something."
2,Disappointing Cooking Video,"When purchasing any kind of cooking video/lesson, you anticipate that recipes will be included with the lesson... There were no recipes included, and these cooking videos were extremely disappointing. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the instructors are all very young chefs who are VERY fond of their cooking. I did not learn anything and was not happy that I purchased these videos."
4,great video,"I have pleanty of cook books for recipes to fill in what was left out of the video. The inspiration, techniques and different product usage made the video well worth not only watching but owning. There was no disappointment for me and it was exactly what I expected. For what it cost it was a great deal. Thanks ever so much!"
3,How to - Cooking show.,I consider Americas test kitchen to be twice as good and easier to duplicate the menu items.RJR
2,disappointment,"No measured recipes, odd pacing and the music was distracting as were the chef vinettes. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!"
3,I thought this was Jacques Pepin.,"I haven't watched it, but when I ordered it, I thought it was about Jacques Pepin. I may have made a mistake."
2,Not One For Wedding Processions,"Adult literary techniques do not always translate well to children's books. Although there is some interesting insight into the lives of children that shows through this book, the writing is forced. Having not read the other Rootabaga Stories, I can't say if Sandburg wrote everything this way, but this particular story is probably one of the most annoying books I've read to my child. The awkward illustrations didn't help either.Having said that, a book is a book and everybody enjoys different kinds of books. I would simply recommend checking it out at the library before you buy it."
3,Really dissapointed,"Not my favorite at all.The characters were good and the details about the Damons and Apollites were interesting, but I guess I was expecting more from the book. I don't have kids, so the whole having-wild-sex-while-pregnant is a little bit disturbing, at least for me. Consider yourself warned."
3,Surprisingly not that good,"This is the first and may end up being only book I've read by Kenyon. There are GREAT parts of this book that I did enjoy. Plus, there are little winks, such as one character reading a book written by one of Kenyon's other pen names. There is also some good action in the book.So I don't think the book was a total failure, but if you like to consider the feeling of the whole vs. parts, it's... okay. When I got done with it all, I didn't feel any closer to understanding the mythology she was trying to build. The ending seemed hokey, and overall, despite some fantastic parts of the story, I had a general feeling of dissatisfaction with it all.If you like Kenyon, I'm sure this review won't sway you, but if you're new to her and think you *might* like her, I'd suggest starting with a different book."
3,Kiss of the Night,"I did enjoy ""Kiss of the Night."" Some of the plot was predictable, but, as with all of the Dark Hunter series, I love the strong heroines and loving yet strong heroes."
3,needed more,"I know that I'm in the minority, but I found this book not close to the other books. I found the constant ""I'm dying"" tiresome.I loved her other books and yes, I'll buy her next one. But I can't give this one but 3 stars. I felt it needed more action and more insight into the characters."
2,Daimon/Apollite Point of View,"Kenyon is a real ""hit and miss"" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - ""Buy,"" ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother."" This books falls between ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother"" book in the Dark Hunter series. The one good thing going for it, is that is gives the other side's (Daimons'/Apollites') point of view.The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 star rating, is because I just finished reading the first book in the Dream Hunter series which had to be rated 1 star since you cannot assign a zero value!"
5,Keeps getting better!,Kiss of the Night is an excellent book. Both Hero & Heroine have a lot to overcome. Their conflicts are twofold coming from external forces as well as their own inner predjuces. Sherilyn Kenyon keeps the heat on through out the story. Every woman needs a little Wulf in her life.Can't wait for Night Play to be released!
3,Fair..looking forward to Bride and Vane's story,"I would have to agree with those who say that this story just isn't up to the level of Kenyon's other dark hunter novels. After reading each of those books I immediately turned back to the beginning and started the book all over again. There was a depth to both the male and female lead characters that just isn't in this one. I found myself more interested in Vane and Bride (brief excerpt from upcoming book contained at the end of this story) I didn't particularly care about either Wulf or Cassandra and was happy when Talon, Zarek and Julian were brought back for brief moments. One possible problem may be the numerous side characters and the excess of detail about the relationship between the gods, appolites, daimons, etc. I wouldn't say don't read this book, but I would caution you not judge the entire series by this one book - the other stories are phenomenal!"
3,TMI - Too much information,"I love all of the dark hunter books. However, I didn't ""feel"" or enjoy this book as much as I have the others because I was trying to absorb the clues and details. Each book is beginning to feel more like a piece of a puzzle than a book. A little frustrating, but still worth it to read. I recommend reading the other books first or this book will be confusing. Since I think this book is a lead into another, I can't wait for the next one. I just hope the next book has more feeling and depth like the others."
3,Okay really 2 1/2 stars,"Can you say, bad? Okay not really horrible but I was disapointed in this book. It rides on the cliche of Baby saves the world. the book drags in places and i really didn't like that.I like Wulf but Ithink his storywas one of the most typical romance novel out of all the Dark hunter books.I just have difficulty with this story, i don't think it was written as well as the other books, but read because of Ash and the others that show up in it, and also because of future books in the series."
5,When enemies meet...,"Wulf Tryggvasen is a man cursed...humans who meet him forget him minutes after he leaves them. Cassandra is the first woman since he's become a Dark-Hunter who doesn't forget him. That's because, Cassandra's not quite human. Her birthday's approaching...a birthday that will either lead to her death, or her becoming Daimon. Wulf is a warrior who has spent centuries killing Daimons...but he begins to doubt if he would be strong enough to kill Cassandra, no matter what. But he'll never have to make that decision because Cassandra doesn't plan to become Daimon. She'll meet her fate. Unfortunately, the gods have other plans...Kenyon's built a world that seems straight forward...good vs evil, light vs dark. But with each new story, she adds more shades of grey and complexities. The result is each book just gets better and better. Kiss of the Night will keep you turning pages."
3,twisted up,"One customer said the author keeps adding more shades of grey in each book. I guess there's just gotten to be too many shades of grey for me. My brain synapses are getting all twisted up. I guess I really like this author's ""were hunter stories"" better, although there are only a few. I wish she'd write more of those in the same vein. They focus more on the romance less on murder and mayhem. The murder and mayhem are more in the background. The ""were hunter stories"" are more fun. This book actually became depressing, because they dwelt so much on the heroine expecting to die and how sad it was that the people of her race had to die so young."
2,Slightly disappointed,"I have to say this was the weakest dark hunter novel to date. Storyline way to conjested and complicated. Sometimes I had a hard time rembering the hero and heroines names so many new characters were introduced in this novel. And whats so bad about it is that all the external characters were more entertaining than the hero and heroine. The Phoebe/Urian romance was hotter than the main characters. Will chalk this one up to everyone has a bad moment, and its easy to do since all her other work was so great. I will just focus on next time and hope for better days."
4,A weaker link to the series ?,"SK has a wonderful concept with the Dark Hunter series, but this is not one of better reads. I enjoyed Dance with the Devil so much more. I couldn't fully immerse myself in the attraction between Wulf and Cassandra and struggled with it throughout the story. The physical attraction is hot, but I couldn't understand how sworn enemies could become soul mates. This book has some emotional parts and some good secondary characters are introduced. There is a reunion of sorts between Wulf, Ash, and the four previous Dark Hunters. Simi also returns for a brief appearance.This book is important to the series; however, because it explains more about the different Daimons, Apollites, and other creatures in the realm."
5,Wulf is great and NOT forgettable,Good book and very emotional one as well. The things we do for love
3,it was.... ok. not the best of her work,"i found this book... well boring.... after reading all of her books, i thought that this would be the same as the other. like how the male characters have a painful, dark past. i read half way then left it for a while. there were something missing in the book. there is no ""magic"" feel whenever you read her other books. i thought it was too fast. the only good thing about this book is that there was zarek. =]"
3,Couldn't Help but Skip around,"I just couldn't get into this story. Great imagery, I love the vikings, vampires too are pretty sexy when viewed from a romantic light. For some reason, I found myself skipping to the ""good stuff"". There was so much fighting, and brawling, I wondered if it really was a romance novel. Maybe I'm crazy. I picked it up from the library because of the cover and felt embarassed actually. Kinda feel like laughing now that I've ""read"" it.I reccomend some better reading if you're into some more sex imagery that comes with a romance novel, AND tough sexy vikings. . . Believe In Me by Josie Litton. Dream Of Me wasn't bad either. But better than Kiss of the Night."
1,Please stop the hype,The first two books were great. The rest are severly over hyped. Each book seems like its only purpose is to set you up to buy the next one. You expect super bad heroes but they are all crying babies. The heroines are awful too. Please stop the train and try something else.
3,Semi-Unforgetable :-D,I pick this one up as soon as it was available. I enjoyed the story and liked the prologue that added to the history of Sherrilyn's world. I didn't like the over lapped of the last two books. I will continue to read the dark-hunter series because I enjoy the character interactions.
3,"Good, but not my favorite","Okay, I know I'm going against the majority, but I just didn't like this installment as much as I liked the other ones.By the way I'm a huge Sherrilyn Kenyon fan and have devored all of her Dark-Hunter novels. They are on my keeper shelf and I re-read them every chance I get.Having said that, Wulf and Cassandra's romance didn't engage me as much as Zerek, Talon, Kyrain and Julian's did. I kept reading the book hoping for something more from them and never getting it. The part I did love about the book was it's prolouge, which gives you a deeper background on Acheron's orgins (which I think I have figured out!!!) and the apperance of the other Dark-Hunter's from her previous books and Julian (which, I thought was the best part of the novel).Yet, I'm still glad I read it, and I hope that the next novel about Vane will be worth me rushing to the store the moment it's released, like I did for this one."
2,Not so good,I felt this 5th book in the series that the author ran out of steam. It was extremely rushed and forced. I thought mortal enemies coming together would be more exciting. This stretched the impossible a little too far for me. I felt the 2 characters connected too soon and for no good reason. Too much discussion of the history of their race and not about their romance.
2,Doesn't hold drinks,"I'm not sure what I was thinking getting this. I wanted something that would hold my drinks (like my son's old sturdy stroller) and provide more storage. It does not hold drinks, they all fall over if you put anything in the drink holder. And the pocket is nice for keys and other things, but if my son is not in the stroller it is back heavy and falls over. I wish I kept the box so I could return it."
5,Good product,"It works and fits perfectly on the Maclaren Quest, and I would imagine on any Maclaren."
4,Don't forget it,It's a great cross selling item. Ask for a discount if you are buying the stroller together.
1,Pain in the Neck,"I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller). At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders. The only function that I actually used was the cup holders, which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would. While I used this bag, it caused more frustration than anything. It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it. The final straw came 6 months after using it. We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back. As a last attempt, I took the bag off, and miracle of miracles! The stroller folds up fine! In my opinion, don't waste your money, just buy a standard cup holder!"
2,Disapointed,"I really wanted to love this product, but I have to say I've only used it a couple times. It just isn't as practical as it looks. It's nice to have the cup holders, but they only fit bottled beverages. The netted portion is REALLY deep, making it very difficult to get items out of it."
4,very useful,"When I initially bought this item I also thought it was meant to be a cup holder, however its not. The two drink holders are for bottles. Most sippy cups don't even fit. Its a good idea, but I always kept my son's bottles in an insulated pack with ice since they held milk, so I can't say we've ever used them.The other storage usage is very helpful. Its very easy to throw extra diapers and a wipes case in the large section. We were overseas for some time, and I also used it to carry groceries home since we didn't have car.I'm glad I purchased this product."
3,Meh.,"Like others have said, this organizer is great because it is flexible. This means it can be left attached when folding up the stroller, and doesn't get in the way when carrying or storing a closed stroller. However it is very poorly designed. The cup holders are so floppy, most drinks (and sippy cups) flip over in them. The cupholders are also very narrow so only small drinks (maybe a can of soda) would work - we have had no luck with grande-sized cold drinks or bottled drinks. The middle compartment is so small, I hardly feel comfortable placing my cell phone in there. The large mesh pocket is a great size, but the velcro closure on top is so darn sticky, it's impossible to open with one hand. I am glad I have this organizer since my Maclaren Volo is bare bones, but I often find I mainly use it to hang things off of (hang a sippy off the edge of the top, throw a sweatshirt over it), rather than items inside it."
2,Cup Holders are Way Too Small,"I bought this for the cupholders. I haven't found a single water bottle, mug, cup, etc that has been able to fit into them. I have the Techno XT which already has storage, so this extra bag wasn't really needed, only the cupholders, which aren't useful to me. I wish I hadn't bought it :\"
4,Decent product,"Very necessary for carrying extra items and when having to fold up the stroller to jump in a cab or head down the subway steps. Cupholders mainly hold slim sippy cups and water bottles. Not made for travel coffee cups, etc... Very thankful that I have mine, although I wish the cup holders were bigger. Front small pocket is perfect for keys and cell phone. Mesh bag in the back with the velcro closure is great for all other items. Still worth it to purchase."
3,Just OK,"I was all excited when I got this. But now I find it's not super useful. I could barely get my water bottle to fit into the cup holder. The cup holder seems flimsy so I doubt it will work with disposable cups (the drinks you would get from a fast food joint that you would most likely be having with you). The storage pocket is hard to open easily with one hand as it velcros shut. But it is still better to have this than nothing at all, because I myself can not get access to the bottom storage basket in my MacLaren."
3,Only ok,"I bought this because reviews recommended it, but I haven't been impressed. The cup holders are surprisingly small, so I can't fit my travel mugs or water bottles in."
3,Very Dated,"This was an excellent book when written 30 years ago however electronics, controls and inverters has changed a lot since then. It would be a good basics book for today however most, if not all, of the companies producing components then are no longer in existence so much of the book is of little value."
5,windpower,"this is a great planning book if you are installing wind power for your place or barn or ect, ect"
3,Nice primer on tall ships,"I found this book to be a nice introduction to the topic of shipboard life. Overall, the book gives the feeling that you are sitting with an old salt discussing sailing. In many instances, drawings in the book have been made from photographs or museum pieces, I would have preferred to see the detail of the photograph rather than a simpler and less accurate drawing. It has some facts on ship life and fittings that I have found no where else, however, it left me wanting more than it could provide. For those interested in finding out a little about the topic (those looking for a primer) this is a nice book with interesting drawings and anecdotal references. For those of a more serious bent, the book will not entirely satisfy."
5,The words truly express a parent's heart,"The music is so peaceful and soothing to my baby girl and me. I was looking for a CD with songs that I could sing to her that would express my love and feelings. This was perfect! Turn it on and you will......sing, smile, and shed a tear as you cradle your precious child."
5,well worth it!,"If you are a fan of the Big Blue or have yet to see it, this is a superb add to your collection. 5 stars is not enough. I love it all."
5,Cool,"For those who didn't see the directors cut yet, this a must see. I saw the film years ago, & I'm happy I bought a copy of it. It's the type of film you'd like to watch more than once. Buy the soundtrack too!"
5,One of the most beautiful films ever made.,"What a gorgeous movie this is. It has become a cult classic in Europe and I wish it could be rereleased in the longer widescreen version. If anyone has a PAL compatable vcr, I would be happy to lend it to you. Jean marc barr is just about perfect. If anyone wants to discuss further, feel free to write."
5,other worldly,this has been my favorite movie since the first time i saw it and has made me a Luc Besson fan. i wish the studio still made it because i have all but worn my current copy down to nothing. you can watch it over and over and it only gets more stunning. the underwater scenes are unbelievable and make you yearn to go diving. the score is moving and the cinematography is unmatched.
5,In Memory,"I write this review after just learning that Jacques, the main subject of the movie, the first man to dive below 330', has died. I loved this picture when I first saw it in theaters, and always felt the ending actually gave the same impression as what one finds in the European version. Yes, the music and the cinematography are great, but what I enjoyed most about the movie was identifying with the idealism of Jacques' character. Enzo, his rival, pursues the sport of free diving, the only sport with actual limits to achievement, for the purposes of the competition. Jacques does it for the romance, and love of the ocean depths. The director, actors, and filmers of this movie bring this all out beautifully- a sport where one can truly become one with the ocean, returning back to our mother, brought into it's truest fruition by Jacques. Rest in Peace, Jacques."
1,Big Blue a Big Disappointment,"I sat down to watch a what i thought was going to be a fascinating and enjoyable film. It turned out to be an over long disappointment which doesn't seem to go anywhere in particular and soon becomes boring. I have now resigned this film to the trash can. If you are thinking of buying this film because of Jean Reno's fine acting and humour, in films such as LEON and GODZILLA. Then don't bother. Jean Reno is a favorite actor of mine but this film was a complete waste of time and talent."
2,The original version is much better,"The original 119 minute version of The Big Blue featuring the superb soundtrack by Bill Conti is my favorite film of all time. After purchasing Bessons Director's cut DVD (the only DVD version available) I found that it greatly slows the pace of the movie while adding very little story. The new accompanying musical score by Eric Sierra is bland and combined with the different ending, the feel of the original film is destroyed. I regret buying this DVD."
3,Original music changed from VHS version :(,"I first watched this movie on VHS video, and loved the movie soundtrack and recurring theme-- I *hate* the music soundtrack on the DVD, which for reasons I can not figure out is completely different from the videotape, the DVD music sounds like elevator music. Yuck! So if you own this movie on VHS videotape, do not dump it when you get or order the DVD version. Aside from the music, the DVD of course is nice because it is digital and is is letterbox format."
3,The Big Blue,"I wish I had not gotten the directors cut, it was way too long. The diving was amazing."
5,The Big Blue is a romantic adventure FULL of passion,"I first saw this movie in the theaters in France in 1988. It is such a moving, passionate story of a man, lonely and yet so full of passion for the sea. Jean Marc Barr is so cute and his quiet nature and gentle spirit are so attractive. The French generally provide a lot of insight to the personalities of their characters, and in this movie, you really become involved in each person's feelings and predicaments. It is an awesome movie that ""takes you in"" and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves LOVE and the complications therein! I am so excited it is coming out in the theaters again on July 14, 2000! Go and see it, then BUY the memory! I am so glad it has finally come out in DVD as I'll be able to see it in French and English! Enjoy - you really will!"
4,The Big Blue,"Big Blue is a joy to watch. The scenery, on land or in the sea is beautiful. The acting is very good. The movie is humorous and mellow. There is a spiritual theme that unfolds towards the end of the movie, but I will not be specific lest I spoil it for others to uncover."
3,Where is BILL CONTI?,I bought this DVD hoping to relive the experience I had watching it as a young boy and cinematically it is still beautiful but I now realize why they took out the cheesy French music for the American release. Bill Conti's score was much more powerful and I cant even watch the directors cut with the sound on because of the ridiculous Euro-disco-80's-synthesizer style score.What garbage..............GET THE OLD VERSION ON VHS IF YOU CAN FIND IT
1,Just a couple of guys holding their breath,"A friend and I saw this in the theater when it was released, and found that it compared favorably to Andy Warhol's ""Empire"" for ""movie where absolutely nothing happens."" The absurdity of ""free diving"" as a spectator sport is complemented by the surrealism of pianos on the beach, etc. As we were walking home, my friend asked, ""What was the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette in the movie?"" I coolly replied, ""Well, she's the love interest. Without her the whole movie would just be about two guys holding their breath."" That last line has been a running joke between us for 18 years."
3,I love this poster,"I love the poster more than the movie. In fact, I have the poster but it is now wrinkled. Who painted this poster of The Big Blue? If you know the answer, pls e-mail to BradleyWilliams@aol.com"
1,Pigs ear from a silk purse,"This is a textbook perfect example of the importance of editing and music score in film as an art form. If this is Luc Bessards idea of what ""Big Blue "" should look like, then it's time he left hollywood...(especially after the ""Messenger"" fiasco!). Mr Samuel Meyer, can we please have a 4.3 version of the original professionally edited film, this time without the cheesy 'porn flik style score?...tell me , would you rescore madam butterfly for the ""new generation""??"
3,Didn't get what I paid for.,I thought I ordered the original french version. The price was high and the information said there was an additional 4 hours of film on the diving. That was not on the DVD I received. I paid a high price for an average film. I would like someone to send me the original film. Why was the price so high for the Americanized short version with no extras? Was this a scam?
5,Neilen Tolmay,"There is only one way to describe Luc Besson's work and that is AMAZING! This movie is a must have for any scuba / deep water diving enthusiast!A brilliant movie that you will come to love as you will never forget the amazing scenery, under water shots, friendship and camaraderie.Buy it - this is a must for any DVD collection as you will just want to watch this again and again to wish you were there!"
3,MUSIC can make the movie....,"I originally saw the American release of this movie several years ago and it became one of my favorite movies. The Director's Cut restores some ""holes"" which were missing from the shortened American version, and this is a good thing. However, while the music in the Director's Cut (Eric Serra's score) is good, it is very 80s-ish and a bit overwhelming at times. I strongly preferred the timeless sounding music from the American version. I was such a big fan of this movie that I would have paid a little extra for both versions to be included in the packaging and am still hoping the American version will be released to us here in America, or at least the Bill Conti score on a CD, as it was quite good."
5,Serenity without compromise,"I saw this movie in France when it came out, and I finally found it at the videostore. No words will do justice to the feelings that this movie awakens. PLEASE RELEASE IT AGAIN."
5,A flawless saphire of magnificent blue...a truly unique gem.,"This movie truly stirred the deepest depths of my soul. The pure and simple goal of the divers, the rugged natural beauty of the scenery, and the passion of the the characters...creates movie magic. No multi-million dollar special effects budget could surpass the fire works ignited by the relationship between these two divers/ childhood friends. Wow!!!"
4,"Um, NOT an all-region DVD","The movie magnificent and magical. But I bought several as gifts, checking the product detail listing to see that the DVD could be viewed in N America. The listing says ""all region."" The DVD says ""region 3."" You CAN watch it in a computer, but I had to include notes of apology and explanation with each gift, which is not really ideal."
4,EXPLORE THE DEEP IN THE BIG BLUE,WE GET SO MUCH FROM THE OCEAN. WE ORIGINATED FROM THE OCEAN. WE SUSTAIN OURSELVES WITH FOOD FROM THE OCEAN. WE EXPLORE THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF LIFE IN THE OCEAN. WE CHALLENGE OURSELVES IN THE SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS AND NEVER ENDING SPACE OF THE OCEAN. WHAT MAKES THE BIG BLUE SO UNIVERSALLY APPEALING IS THE WONDERFUL IMPACT IT HAS ON EVERYONE WHO WATCHES THE FILM. IT NATURALLY CAPTIVATES THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE WE FEEL AS ONE WITH THE OCEAN AND WE ARE IN AWE OF IT'S MAGNIFICENT BEAUTY. WHAT A SHAME THIS MOVIE HAS NOT BEEN RE-RELEASED ON DVD IN AN EXTENDED LENGTH WIDESCREEN VERSION? COLUMBIA TRISTAR HOME VIDEO SHOULD BE CONTACTED VIA E-MAIL AT CTHVONLINE@ACCRADATA.COM AND ALL OF US SHOULD DEMAND THAT THE BIG BLUE BE RE-RELEASED IMMEDIATELY ON DVD AND VHS.
3,scenery,"For many people, this is a beautiful, inspiring film-a favorite in fact-but I have never really felt so drawn to this film. It has attained a kind of cult status, but I don't think it is because the story itself is so compelling. It is beautiful, particularly in cinematographic terms, but for example, the presence of Rosanna Arquette is several strikes against the film right off the bat. She alone can almost ruin the film, and she very nearly does. The cinematography is stunning and the lifelong competition between two very different men (Jean Reno and Jean-Marc Barr) with very similar purposes is fascinating to watch. Jean-Marc Barr portrays Jacques, a very sensitive young man with a deep connection to the sea; Jean Reno is more extravagant as Enzo, a more boisterous sort. Be sure to watch the director's cut; not the American cut up version. The added footage makes a more reflective film, even if not deeply ""action packed""."
4,Jean-Marc Barr is the real star...Rosanna Arquette is lame,"great movie if you are sensitive and intelligent. if none of these apply to you, watch it anyway, you could learn something."
5,"Emotion, imagery, style and power","This movie was magnificent. The beauty and power of each shot was overwhelming. I was amazed by the level of cinematography. Without one spoken word I would have loved this movie. When you add Jean Reno one cannot help but become enthralled by each scene, each new movement and dialogue. I cannot find the words to express how much I love this motion picture. I only wish I could find a copy of it."
5,childhood dream...,"Please, release that movie again! I'm French and I was 9 years old when I first saw this magical movie for the first time...it's been a lot more since then! But I've been in the US for 3 years now and I've been trying to get the long English version (which is about 3 hrs of dream) I've had the soundtrack for 11 years and I listen to it all the time, but please let me see (and possibly own) the English version again!!!"
5,Great In So Many Ways,"Very authentic Greek scenes and culture, gorgeous locations, very emotionally charged story with unexpected turns. Totally unpredictable. Timeless."
4,Beware Directors with Big Egos,"First off, allow me to say that The Big Blue is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it more times than I can count, and since I nearly wore out my VHS copy, I'm incredibly grateful that it's being released on DVD.I'm also incredibly grateful that, with the Director's Cut, we get to see the original ending for the movie, which is much more ambiguous and thus much more ""real"" than the tidy American version. My complaint is that 3 hours seems a bit much for this movie. Do we really need to see Jacques and Enzo on the oil rig? Do we really need so much of deaf Uncle Louie? Director's cuts can be wonderful things (take Bladerunner, for example). They can also be testaments to the egos of the directors, who seem to feel that if they shot it, it's worth going on screen. Sometimes a little editing can go a long way."
4,see the version released in europe,"i saw this movie back in '90 while living in paris. I was completely taken with the film, as was most of paris! after returning to the us, i was disappointed watching the american edition which had the most hilarious deep sea diving scene removed and replaced with more of the human romance story, which i found somewhat lacking. the true passion of the movie is the sea and it was a blow to me to have it edited in this fashion for american audiences. i still want a copy of the movie (preferably an unedited version) and i highly recommend the soundtrack. it still invokes the beauty of this movie for me after so many years!"
5,A wonderful movie about the sea,Big blue is the one and only movie that would be the best to view in the advanced digital video technology of today. But it is a shame that there are no versions of this movie even in VHS format. Please inform me if one day it would be possible for all of us to watch this movie in VHS
5,"Water, Water Everywhere","I have never been so blown away by any film's ending as I was by this one. It's worth it to sit through hours of the most gorgeous underwater cinematography (I've) ever seen just to get to the conclusion. I have seen a lot of visually stunning movies in my pursuit of an engrossing experience but this tops them all. Regardless of your opinion of the caliber of some of Luc Besson's other efforts (5th Element comes to mind) you really should at least rent this movie. It's a shame that most video stores that stock it do not stock the Director's Cut. It is the story of a man, a free-diver by trade, obsessed by dolphons. Allusions are made throughout to his supernatural connection to this special mammal. Rosanna Arquette falls in love with him and watches his attachment to the sea and the dolphins in it grow until it threatens to consume their relationship."
2,Le Grand Bleu Import,"I didn't notice the import when I ordered this item, it's factory made and is poor quality.The Big Blue: Le Grand Bleu (Director's Cut - Import)"
2,"CD quality not too good, disc skips",quality of the actual CD is poor and it's hard to watch the whole movie without skipping passage...
3,Stunishing!,This is one of the best cinematographed movies ever. When it comes to the plot it has some difficulties but overall this is a great movie and the DVD has decent extramaterial where the isolated score is the biggest extra.
2,I just love Bill Conti's music better,"I absolutely love this movie. However, I am American and I probably fell in love with it more because of the music than the actual movie (though I do love the movie also). Luc Besson did an excellent job. I am glad he changed the music from Eric Serra to Bill Conti for the American version. It would however, have been nice to see the full length with the Bill Conti music. I have heard both soundtracks and in my mind, Bill Conti created the only music for this film. I won't be buying the DVD since it contains the Eric Serra soundtrack but I finally found the American version on VHS (out of print now)."
3,The shorter US version was better,"I loved this movie, but it is unfortunate that the DVD version has only the longer director's cut. The shorter version released in America was a better movie, tightly edited, with a more interesting and enigmatic portrait of the diver, Jacque. They also, mercifully, replaced the original French new-age soundtrack, which drove us crazy when we watched the long version."
3,Disapointing new Music Score,I was trying to find this movie for long time because I had the first version on VHS. And I was very disappointed and mad with the Music score in this DVD release. The Old songs were perfect for this beautiful Movie. I think I will keep trying to find the old VHS version.
1,The Director Ruined His Own Movie,"And the only reason it got ONE star was because of the amazing photography and the amazing score. While I am usually a big believer in letting the artist express the story he wants to tell, this ""director's cut"" completely destroys a wonderfully simple film. As much as I love the additional underwater footage, you don't need to spell out every last beat in this story. The key to the film is the relationship with Jacque and the ocean - everything else is used show how important that is. Rosanna Arquette's part was raised from a supporting cast member to a starting role - WHO CARES ABOUT HER?!?! Nobody. As much as I have loved many of Luc's films, please be wary of the director's cut of this one. Bigger is NOT definately better. There's a reason that editors are hired on films - to cut the film down to what it needs to be. This version is a perfect example of how a ""director's cut"" can ruin a film"
3,Stick with the MSDN library and MS web site,These sources cover everything you need about this fairly small API
5,Excellent primer on WinInet and it's various applications,"Skonnard's book clearly explains the basics of using WinInet and provides useful examples that tie WinInet into other technologies that I use, such as COM, MFC and ASP. The author found a good balance between providing basic API details and contextual information for writing Internet client applications. Unlike some books that simply dive into the details with no context, this book contrasts WinInet with other options (e.g. Winsock), providing the right amount of context for real-world application development."
2,Not For VB,I arrived at this book when I was doing searches on a refrence to help me use WinInet with Visual Basic. The book is not really a VB book at all. It barely mentions how to accomplish the tasks of their projects in VB. Everything is aimed at C++.
1,Don't Try the COM Examples,"I used this book to navigate around the Windows Internet API and managed to put together a decent desk top application in C++.NET. Great. But the COM examples are so full of errors that they can not be compiled from the source code provided from the publisher. Now I'm not a super COM programmer but have put together COM applications with some success. However, it seems the author slapped together the COM chapter with little or no thought."
2,Flop-o-rama!,"Dear Reader,I usually enjoy Michael Stackpole books very much. It greatly pains me to write a poor review for one of his books. Quite frankly, however, The Grand Crusade stinks! At the risk of spoiling the novel I pose this question: Why ""kill off"" the most likable character of the series and then bring him back as an animated slab of lava? Another question: Is it really necessary to include the romance scenes between the old man and the hot twenty-something? It was sick enough to make me put the book down and watch ""Simpsons"" reruns. Worst Series Ending Ever!"
1,Very disappointing,"I've never read Michael Stackpole and was pretty happy with the first book in this series..couldn't wait until the second one came out. Of course, the ending was a bit of a shock (the author's own notes warn about ill will towards him because of it) but I still was hoping the story would pick up a bit of speed and resolve itself in the third installment. What did I find? Ho-Hum...I had to force myself to finish. Nothing is resolved to any satisfactory measure - the most important character is a lump of clay (literally) and the other characters just seem to start fading away. We can't always expect a happy ending, but there didn't even seem to be one at all! A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash. Next time one of his books come out I'll be sure to see if my local library has it first so I at least don't bother spending my own money."
3,"Pretty good, but it could have been better.","'The Grand Crusade' is the last book of DragonCrown War series. I loved the pace of the book, because it is as fast-paced as the other reviewers have mentioned. Still, the whole nature of the Norrington prophecy was not fully explained to my liking. Nor was Kerrigan Reese esteemed even half as much as Will. I did not feel as drawn to Will as I was to the character of Kerrigan Reese throughout the whole series. We see Will having a one night fling with the Princess, and people considered that to be love. Yet, there was love and that was solely found with Alexia and Crow. Plus, a more thorough explanation and psychological profile of Chytrine would have thoroughly boosted the book. So, these are my main criticisms about the series in general and the book in specific."
3,Not up to par,"The first two books in this series, and I'm including the prerquel, were excellent. This book was way to brief. We spent hundreds of pages building up to a final battle that was boring, over way to quickly, and didn't make alot of sense compared to the chain of events seen in the previous novels.The Will dilemna is solved in a very unsatisfactory way as were pretty much all the resolutions. It seemed as if Stackpole thought hey time to end it and just threw something together thtat tied up all loose ends. I didn't feel like the ending was given much thought."
3,So much potential....,"I read the first two books of the series and thoroughly enjoyed them, but was pretty disappointed with the third book.This book had so much potential, but Stackpole made the mistake of killing off the most interesting and important main character and while I'm sure he did this to shock the reader, it ruined the book.I read the third book to see if by some ""miracle"" that the character would be resurrected, but was disappointed. Once that character was taken out of the book, it totally ravaged the trilogy. It took the spirit out of the book. I had to force myself to read the rest of the book and instead of being entertained by the ending, it just left me feeling plain depressed."
3,A weak ending but not a bad book,I'm a big fan of Stackpole and it pains me to say that this book was a let down. The Dark Glory War was an awesome book and a great way to start the series. The next two books were great as well. However the standards are set so high and what he comes back with is a very anticlimatic ending. The ending is fairly predictable and the descriptions of the battles are probably the worst of any I've ever seen him write. It does hurt the series but the quality of the rest of the books makes the series well worth the read.
1,I won't buy this ever again,"This is not what I thought it was, is a book about how to become a writer, or learn how to be writer. I was reading just the first page and I was already bored to death!I returned it."
5,Great book,I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Bruce Hornsby. Luckily I did! Trying to find each Hornsby lyric that the author placed in each one of his poems was certainly very fun and quite challenging!If you're a fan of Bruce Hornsby.......and The Shawshank Redemption.......then you'll definitely like this book.
2,An interesting approach to the concept of Salem witchery,"I was lucky enough to find a first edition copy of this book in a local bookstore. I bought it for its date (1928) and the excellent wood-cut illustrations scattered throughout. Inside was glued a newspaper review placed there by (I assume) the first owner -- it was an interesting enough find. Of course I read the book, though solely out of curiosity and the fact that I had forgotten Esther Forbes' authorship of the lame novel Johnny Tremain. The book read quickly, though seemed more like a novel from the 19th century than one from the Jazz Age. The content was interesting, but neither 'engaging' nor 'vigorous' as its newspaper review had led me to believe. On the whole, though I admit my pride regarding the ownership of the unique 1st edition, I do not plan on recommending the book to anyone not extensively studying literature regarding early witchery or the behavioral history of early Salem, Massachusetts inhabitants."
2,alright,"not worth the price, you can get far better ones in India. The product was sub-standard, and chipped easily. We are a University group with no choice, however, and we went ahead. Mid-east instruments was very nice about it though, and sent us a new Ghatam free of charge. That had its defects too, but they're both alright, but not for someone who is a Ghatam maestro."
3,Decent CD,"But other than LL's tracks, there really isnt any other ones that stand out as ""awesome"" songs. It isnt a terrible album, however, and is worth a listen, especially if you like some of the other artists on the CD. I was a tad disappoined though."
1,OMG THIS CD IS SO GOOD LOL,"I CAN't BeLIEvE HOw GooD THIs CD Is. LL COOl j is da boom boOM BOmB.

3,Offensive,"I thought this movie was good in that it showed what causes violence from one to another, general dissatisfaction with one's own life and the feeling of inadequacy, as shown by both the men and the women in the film.However, as many of Fassbinder's movies, this movie was biased against Germans. Fassbinder, my opinion, was a racist and anti-semitic man. The movie Katzelmacher, for instance, concludes with Jorgos telling the German woman that Germans are cold and therefore bad and that Greeks are warm and loving and, hence, good. I find that very racist.Also, in Katzelmacher and other movies (ie. Ali: Fear eats the Soul), Fassbinder portrays Germans as being especially racist. I grew up in Germany, and have met people from all over. The Germans are no more racist than anyone else. Minorities and foreigners experience prejudice everywhere in the world.Fassbinder seems to think that the way to fight racism is by being racist."
2,"She must have been in another place and time, because this is definitely not Donna Summer at her best","Not one of the more distinguished productions by the great Stock-Aitken-Waterman team, this album is definitely one of the worst ever instances of a great disco artist trying to make the transition to 80s R&B. This album did spawn the huge hit ""This Time I Know It's For Real,"" which is by all means a great song. Unfortunately, nothing else on the album even comes close to it, and since the song is available on most or all of Donna Summer's many hits collections, I would just get it that way instead."
1,FALLIN' FOR SAW PRODUCTION,"It didn't work for Kylie Minogue, neither Bananarama, the SAW production it's the music that dated the less gratefully from the 80's music. So Summer take on this ill advice move, although yes we all know she returned to the top 10 with THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL, the sound on this album sounds extremely dated, and hearing the entire album it's extremely painful since I DON'T WANNA GET HURT and LOVE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE MY HEART sound extremely equally the same. This record does not differ from other produced SAW, who in fact could be say was pure 80's POP disposable music, no wonder they didn't promote Kylie's 80's music in America, it was like this Summer album painful."
3,synth-pop is good,"A lot of people don't realize that Donna Summer really doesn't do soul music; she does Euro. Her hits of the late 70s were produced by Giorgio Moroder who pioneered what is presently referred to as euro-disco. It's isnt suprising that in the late 80s she would team with Stock, Aitken and Waterman to make an album; they were the epitemy of euro-dance in the late 80s. This album is a collection of dance-pop in the style of Rick Astly and some of the songs are really nice. I liked this CD when it was big, I don't listen to it too much now."
2,bad reputation,"Donna Summer's 1989 album ""another time and place"" is a cheap attempt to break into the pop charts again by teaming up with devastatingly unoriginal British producers Stock Aitken Waterman, the team behind the bubble-gum pop of Kylie Minogue and Rick Astley. As a result, most of the songs on the album turn out similar, and totally lack originality. ""This time I know it's for real"" could have been sung by, say, Kylie Minogue with equal conviction. In other words, Donna Summer is really selling herself way too cheap to be working with these untalented producers. Stock Aitken Waterman has only produced 2 great albums in their time. The first is Rick Astley's smash hit debut album ""Whenever you need somebody"" and the second is Bananarama's 1987 dance classic ""Venus"" and ""I heard a rumor"". Donna Summer's album pales in comparison."
1,Worthless!,"This book is 50% old exams (old, and current exams are available for free on the USPTO website) and 50% snippets from the MPEP (also available for free on the USPTO). The snippets are have plenty of errors (both typos and in content), its outdated, and provides almost no useful information.It provides only the highest level of overview that doesn't come close to anything that will help you pass the patent bar. If you don't want to spring for the expensive study aids and think this is a cheap way to get some help, you're going to be very disappointed. You're much better off slugging your way through the old exams and MPEP on your own. If you write down the first sentence in every major section of the MPEP, you've just about wrote this book."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I was looking for a high-level tool to provide context as I studied for the exam, which I passed. This book didn't provide anything that wasn't already available for free elsewhere and represents nothing more than a slipshod attempt to make a fast buck. There is a need for such a book, but this isn't it. I'd recommend ""Patent It Yourself"" as a supplement to the various professional bar prep materials to get the big picture."
1,A disaster,"This book is just a disaster: the introduction material is completely worthless, and the old exams, are, obviously, old and outdated."
1,"Don't buy even if you think ""what the heck""","Idiotic book which tries to over simplify the complex rules. More than half of the book reprints the free material from the USPTO website Q&A. A total waste. I bought this book thinking that at the most I will lose [the money]. But after reading, I was irritated by the fact how can someone write such a book and sell it. Ridiculous !"
1,Insufficient prep material for Patent Bar,"The Patent Bar Exam is a very difficult exam and if one studied the first half of this book and memorized it, there is no way that a person would pass the exam. This book could have given some very useful tips on how to study the 3,000 page MPEP, of which the tester is responsible for knowledge of its context. The second half of the book has copies of exams that can be obtained free on-line. There is a need for a better book."
1,Patent Bar Exam Review,"This book is cryptic, outdated and does not provide a basis for understanding the neccessary analysis required for passing the patent examiners exam.There are analyses one must understand and recognized, such as obviousness and anticipation, and the associated tests, as well claim writing etc., in order to pass the exam. This text fails in these regards, and mainly lists portions of the MPEP and other patent law statutes, in a non-intuitive manner.I purchased two copies of this book; one for myself and another person. The purchse was was not worth the money nor the time invested in the text."
1,Unreliable,This book is not useful at all. This book contains past exam papers that are freely available online. This book underestimates the level of knowledge that is required to appear for the patent bar exam.Watch my YouTube video guide: http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bishalnepal&view;=playlists
4,A good supplement - Distills the MPEP into 65 pages,"This is a good supplement to study from, however its a bit out of date now (year 2000). While the book has direct quotes from parts of the MPEP, thats precisely what I needed to pass the exam.. (The patent bar exam doesnt allow you to take in ""notes"" but does allow you to take in sections of the MPEP.)The 4000 page MPEP is essentially distilled into 65 pages of the most commonly tested questions on the Patent Bar in this book. Its a great supplement to studing, and its easy to read question and answer form helped me pass this difficult test."
4,Patent Bar Exam,The book arrived in a timely manner and was indeed in very good condition for a used book.
1,LOW ON QUALITY,"shorts were ruined on the second day i wore them. the waist string broke. instead of being made by one continuous string, it was composed of 2 strings which were stiched into the waist band at the back of shorts and tightened in the front. as a result, when tightened, it came loose and was rendered useless. i believe i had the same problem with a pair of their sweatpants in the past. i will stay clear of their products in the future.let's face it- you get what you pay for. russell athletic has lost a customer. low quality"
2,not good quality,shorts looked and fit good but began unravelling along the waistband immediately.have had Russell apparel previously and had no problem
3,"they are good but wash weird,","maybe its the performance cotton but they have a weird texture after being washed a few times. & the elastic seems stretched huge, usually for big&tall I need to get him a 38 or 40 waist item, but this seems bigger... My husband likes them well enough to sleep in so they work but I will not be buying them again, its a decent value for the price, but if you want more of a work out short, you might want to look elsewhere"
2,Workout Shorts,"Bought these shorts for a basic pair to wear and workout at a sports club. The price was good, but the quality of the shorts is lacking. Very light cotton material - not much to them, and the elastic waist string doesn't have any strength or elasticity... wouldn't buy them again.... sorry :("
1,Russell Athletic Men's Shorts,"The shorts were HUGE and baggy, dropping below the knees. Not suitable for working out at the gym. They were returned for credit."
2,Not true to size,"I ordered these shorts to replace my husband's old pair of Russell shorts. Although I ordered the same size, the new ones were far larger, and the fabric was much thinner and lower quality than the older shorts. I sent them back."
2,OK For Around The House/Wouldn't Wear Them In Public,". . . but, that's just me.I think that these gym shorts are less than I have come to expect from Russell Athletic. Maybe Russell has a cheaper line of clothing to fill a low price niche.These shorts don't look very stylish. They are a boxy looking cut with no real shape to them.Material is just OK and not very soft feeling. Hems are OK, I guess, but don't look like anything special; I won't be surprised if the hems begin to unravel. The Russell logo is an iron-on as opposed to the stich-on that they have used on other lines.Be aware that they are an 8"" inseam so, depending on your height, they might not reach the knee.They look a size larger then tagged.I got these on an Amazon special price of $4.03. I wouldn't pay more for them after seeing them.For me they're OK for hanging around the house or for warm weather sleepwear. I won't wear them in public because of the boxy, short, oversized look of them."
3,"Nice Shorts, but they run larger that size.","I ordered these shorts in 3X. I should have ordered 2X or smaller. The 3X is really big. They are nice quality, but do not run true to size. Do yourself a favor and order a size smaller that you usually wear."
3,FUlly functional,"As long as you don't mind looking like a dork due to the gargantuan circumference of the legs, these shorts have proven to be durable and functional."
5,New Shorts,I wanted something comfortable at a good price and thats what I got with these Russell shorts. The comfort of cotton at less than half the cost of similar items.
4,"These are not always 100% cotton, or the right size","I ordered Black, Navy and Graphite, all the same size. The Graphite was 50% polyester & 50% cotton, and smaller than the others, even though it was the same XL size (the description says the color Oxford is 58/42 poly/cotton, but Graphite is supposed to be 100% cotton). I returned it and got another Graphite, which was also 50/50 poly/cotton, but it was the right size (made in El Salvador, whereas the smaller one was made in Pakistan). I guess you take your chances on getting the right size and material. Otherwise, these are good, comfortable shorts."
2,Terrible Sizing,The sizing of these shorts is a joke. Read all the reviews very carefully before buying - something has changed within the last couple years.
5,Athletic Pocket Shorts,"Ordered these for my husband after a knee surgery. The size was a little to large, but did not have any problems returning for the correct size. Seems to be good quality fabric, and were comfortable."
2,A real let down.,"Let me start by saying that in my past experience I loved the shorts that I purchased in the past. I previously ordered a pair in light grey, and the dark blue... they were well made, comfortable, and a real value. I was shocked to discover that by changing the color the quality would drop so drastically.They are very thin and poorly sewn. I discovered a large hole in the seam the first time I put my hand in my pocket. The Russell logo on the leg is a cheap iron on an d not the embroidered logo that is on the 2 previous pairs I ordered. Had I known they would differ from color to color I would have stuck to the colors I had before. These shorts are good for sleep shorts maybe but they are too thin and poorly sewn to wear out of the house. I am really disappointed."
2,disappointed,Nice fit and good price but they unravel fast!Thread comes right out of them.It is a dirty shame!
4,A little short on the waistband,"I have purchased Russell Athletic shorts before. They are quality products. As with other Amazon purchases, the price is right and the shipping is punctual. The only thing that would improve the shorts would be better / stronger elastic in the waist. If you load up the pockets, they sag a little."
4,Deep pockets,My husband likes the deep pockets and wears these shorts when he exercises at the gym. He has liked the Russell brand for years.
3,Great for Summer sleepwear,I love these shorts for lounging around the house on de-stress days. They are comfortable and soft and great for sleeping in during the Summer months.
4,Russell baseline short,"Exelent product!For all kind of weatherconfortabledurable!!I wear everyday to: go to gym, walk and to stay at home!!"
5,Excellent for me,"I ordered 3 pairs of these. I did not need anything heavy to run in, and I didn't want running shorts that were too short, and these were perfect. Great for running in and working around the house."
5,Great athletic shorts,Sized rather on larger size. Originally ordered an x-large and had to downsize to a large. Other than the sizing issues they're great shorts.
1,no happy camper,"I was very unhappy with this product. These are not the same quality cotton performance shorts that I bought a couple of years ago. The material was way too thin and the size was probably two sizes larger than indicated on the tag. I used to really like Russell products,what has happened to them?"
1,poor fit compared to the past,Russell is using yet another off shore manufacture and the quality is not the same. The shorts are sized different then the past that I have worn for years. The waist to crouch is 3 inches longer and the crouch to leg is yet another 3 inches. The Russell R on the side is not stitched any longer but an iron on.
5,Pretty good,"I owned a pair of the graphite (well I think that's what it started out as) shorts. The were made in Mexico and were great. So...I decide to buy 2 of these. One in graphite, the other in black.The graphite is a cotton/polyester blend which makes for a softer, more comfortable feel. The black is 100% cotton and it's not a soft cotton.Although the quality is good, I think Russell should go back to what made them a good company in the first place. They should ensure their product (same model) is made in the same place and of the same material."
1,"Sizing: 18"" rise with an 8"" inseam. Terrible fit.","I read the reviews about sizing and the shorts being too big but I didn't think that would bother me since I like larger shorts for working out. It isn't that these shorts are too big, the design is horrible.These shorts have an 18"" rise and an 8"" inseam that still takes the hem to just above the knee. Take a minute to imagine an 18"" rise ...you can pull these shorts up to your arm pits!"
3,Needs a better waistline,Good fabric for exercise. Hadn't really focused enough on the waist which is really just the drawcord so it folds over too easily.
3,Typical shorts at a decent price,There's nothing spectacular about these shorts. They're shorts. But they are less expensive than in department stores. They're comfortable enough.
5,what better than a christmas album sung by an angel,"i have been a long tome fan of Jewel's and her voice is just so amazing. she can take rudolph the red-nosed reindeer and turn it into a cute even more charming song. songs like gloria and ave maria are just beautiful. and unlike other singers when she sings o holy night she actually hits the high notes. it puts you right into the xmas spirit. there are even a few tracks where Jewel duets with her mother Nedra. even if you like it for no other reason other than it is a good xmas cd listen to it, because you will love it"
2,Not that great,Some of the songs are not that good - kind of disappointed in this one. Jewel has an awesome voice but this album doesn't show her talent as well as I thought it would.
4,"Beautiful, but......","I would have given this a 5 star if it was not for ""Winter wonderland"" and ""Rudolph""; they do not belong to this beautiful CD! I want to buy and send a Christmas CD to my friend, but - sorry - it will not be this."
5,An absolutely gorgeous album,"Okay, after begging my mother for oh, I don't know, a million and one times, I have failed to actually OWN the album. (hint, hint mother in case you're reading this) But I have listened to samples, and listened in the music stores so many times I've lost count. (yes I know, sad...) But truly, this album is a must, Jewel uses her voice well (yet again - 'Spirit' was great) making the already beautiful all-time-favourite carols even more. Personal fave is A Little Town Of Bethlehem, but others are just as good. The Christmas version of Hands is a well done too. Miss it and miss out BIG TIME!"
3,Expected More,"Like ""Spirit,"" I'm afraid this album doesn't have even a shadow of the Jewel that we saw on her first release. Don't get me wrong - this is an enjoyable Christmas album. However, given the extraordinary talent and potential of Jewel, I expected much more.In my opinion, Jewel didn't really understand why her first album sold umpteen-million copies. I believe that she thinks it has something to do with her ""message"" and ""deepness."" That's not why the vast majority of her fans liked the first album. It was because of the soaring and awe-inspiring vocal performance. Since that first album we've not heard any awe-inspiring vocal performances, but we *have* seen her showcasing her supposed ""deepness"" in everything she does. The poetry, the bizarre artwork... Jewel, millions and millions loved you for your voice. And that's what is missing on this album."
3,OK but not great,"I thought that this CD lacked some of the talent that Jewel is famous for and that it was not very deep at all, but everything was shallow."
5,Very Beautiful!,"I am DEFINETELY not a Jewel fan. In fact, I hated her other two cd's. I had to admit that she did an excellent job on this Christmas cd and her voice is very beautiful. I think she does better when she doesn't write her own songs."
5,Truly an Insperation,"Ok, I admit it, I was a fan of Jewel back in the day when her first album came out. Times however, have changed. I don't really consider Jewel one of my ""Top 10"" artists. She might not even make the top 100, but this album was truly an insperation. This is a truly magical album. If you buy ONE album this christmas, make it Jewel's! It is worth it!"
5,I've heard the voice of an Angel.....and it is Jewel!,"I wasn't overly familiar with Jewel before buying this disc, but picked it up based on reviews here. I own well over 100 Christmas CDs -- so I'm not easy to impress. However, Jewel's voice is a gift, and she uses it extremely well in this bound-to-become-a-classic collection. It's moving, poignant and, most of all, sincere. It's not overly done, so as to let her voice shine through. The arrangements are lovely.I highly recommend this disc."
4,"Gorgeous Voice, Very Good CD","I wasn't really a big Jewel fan, but this album has won me over. Give her credit...she is willing to try new arrangements on some tired old Christmas songs (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and it works. Her voice throughout is wonderful and the arrangements are first-rate.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I wasn't too enamored of her decision to include some of her own stuff and her inclusion of ""From a Distance."" When I buy a Christmas album I want Christmas music. That said it is still a great CD and will provide variety to you Christmas collection."
5,Rare Jewel,"Not being a Jewel fan, I was really surprised to find this Christmas album to be quite good and inspiring. An unusual mix (for a modern album) of holiday songs, I was struck at the simplicity of most of the arrangements and the fullness of Jewels voice on familiar carols like ""Joy To The World"" and ""I Wonder As I Wander."" Jewel makes us believe these are tunes that she is well acquainted with; nothing seems forced or untrue. The only ""light"" numbers on the album are ""Winter Wonderland"" and a unique arrangement of ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer."" As Christmas music goes, this is above average fare from a very popular artist. It's become part of my steady Christmas music rotation."
2,Joy - Not Half Bad,"The first half of this Christmas album is very good. Jewel does wonderful versions of classic songs. Beginning with track 8 (Rudolph), however, this album takes a nose dive. While some reviewers consider Jewel's Rudolph a ""playful"" rendition, my wife and I just found it dumb (one of those tracks you just want to immediately skip over). In the second half of the album, the best songs (or parts of songs in the case of ""Life Uncommon"") are essentially just remixes of ""Hands"" and ""Life Uncommon"". But you can get these - and many other great songs - by just buying Jewel's Spirit CD (which is excellent). So in a nutshell, the first half of this CD gets 5 stars, while the second half knocks the total down to 2."
5,Music That Touches The Spirit and The Heart,"This is one of the most incredible cd's, Christmas or otherwise, that I have ever listened to. Jewel's voice is so clear and pure it touches my spirit and heart in ways that only Pachelbel's Canon, with it's violins, has done before. The soprano voice fills the space around you with love and happiness. The ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" is just plain fun. I recommend this CD highly. It will fill your home, office or car with a rare beauty. Thank you, Jewel!"
4,The voice of an angel,"This album shows off the extraordinary clarity and depth of Jewel's voice. O Holy Night, Ave Maria and her own composition, Gloria are exquisite. The arrangements are beautiful. I don't particularly care for the odd version of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. It would have been better as a full scat version similar to how she's been doing Who Will Save Your Soul live. I saw Jewel in concert last summer, but this is the first CD I've bought by her. Worth every penny for both Jewel fans and Christmas music fans."
5,a new classic,"Jewel puts her own folky twist to the traditional Christmas classics and introduces a couple of tunes that should become standards as well. Her soft, sweet voice expresses the message of the hymns about Christ's virgin birth and His life here as our Savior. Her fun rendition of Rudolph is wonderful. You'll catch your toes tapping with ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"". Good job, Jewel. I love it!"
2,Insipid,"A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available."
1,Stick to what you know!,I love Jewel--I have all of her CDs and I love all of them--except this one. The same qualities that make Jewel enchanting and beautiful just make her seem whiny and annoying when singing these Christmas songs. I don't recommend this CD at all.
1,This album was so boring!,"I heard the album, and I'm grateful I didn't buy it! Not only were her renditions boring, but her range was pretty limited. In some of her songs, her voice wavered and she strained on the high notes. Her version of ""Rudolph"" almost put me to sleep! And ""Walking in a Winter Wonderland"" was dull. She sounded more like a choir boy, before puberty, than an actual woman. I think I'll stick to Bing Crosby. This one left me falling asleep."
1,"Oh, my!","When this came on, we said, ""What was that!?"" To us it was awful, which does not mean that there is probably someone out there who would like it. Just too crazy for us. We were not familiar with Jewel, or would not have ordered it."
2,Merry Jewel,"This is the closest thing to mainstream folk Christmas album anyone will get. Although there are backing vocals and an orchestra thrown in for extra holiday glee, this still sticks to a campfire sing-a-long feel. Jewel's vocals stray close to yodeling territory without getting too uncomfortable.A Holiday Collection remains not as exciting as other season albums, even with a helping hand from a jingled-up version of ""Hands."""
1,Who Would Have Known It Was Possible to Ruin Rudolph?,"If I could give this album 0 stars, I would have. This is probably the worst CD in the whole entire world. I previously did not believe that it would be possible to ruin 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer', but I was so, SO wrong. This woman takes every classical Chrismas song and turns them into her own rendition of 'Oh, Poor Me' with her disgustingly whiny voice and extremely lousy musical ""talents"". She tackles beautiful pieces like 'O Holy Night' and fails miserably. Her adolescent sound is fine on the sound stages of Lilith Fair, but she should leave the traditional Christmas carols and familiar holiday songs to people who at least SOUND like they enjoy performing. This is the single worst CD of all time."
3,not bad but not great,"I'm a huge fan of jewel's, but she can't really ""carry"" a lot of the songs eg.Rudoloph,Silent Night, etc...she has a beautiful voice, and this album is a must have if you like christmas music, but for somone [like me] who's not really into xmas music, this would be a bore...again beautiful voice and the best songs are ""Winter Wonderland, and ""life Uncommon..."
4,It's Cool,"This CD is awesome. I could only sometimes find recordings of Christian music that was satisfying. I would recommend it. I think Jewel is a really excellent composer. Key tracks are: Joy to the World, O Holy Night, Silent Night, Hark the Herald Angels Sing and Hands."
5,Blending the ancient and the contemporary,"Anoop Chandola stages the intersection of ancient Indian mythology and contemporary reality. From the vantage point of a migrant living in the United States, Chandola provides us a glimpse into the ongoing reinvention of tradition in unlikely circumstances, gracefully balancing contradictions even when they can't be solved. The past never disappears, but only a few can allow us to discern its evolving significance in the chaos of the present. Chandola's characters are routinely charming and endearing, insisting upon the possibilities of community, integrity and dignity over either blind ritual or capitulation to indivdualism. Here is a rare writer who gives us the benefit of wisdom born of careful, benign observation in multiple cultural locations, successfully addressing multiple audiences.Vik Bahl, Ph.D."
5,Typical Ortega!,I love Fernando Ortega and he did not disappoint me with this CD! It is easy listening and inspirational at the same time. Typical Fernando Ortega!
2,A little disappointed,"He has been exceptional in the past, but with this last cd I beleive he has lowered his music standard. A little to rocky for me! The words to his songs are superb."
1,Disappointing,"I ALSO ordered this item as a gift way back in Dec. I patiently waited for the item to ship out; first I received an e-mail confirmation saying this item is taking longer to get than expected etc etc...and they asked would you still want to wait or cancel...so I said yes, i'll wait even though it was already the middle of Jan.Then the next day I received another e-mail saying this is item is no longer available.....pretty disappointing =(the good thing is - at least they didn't charge me"
1,What a gyp!,"I've just cancelled this recording of ACL from a pending order here at Amazon. I've learned that this CD does NOT include ""And..."" --one has to go to Sony's Rhapsody to download it. (There's also some karaoke tracks that are available only at iTunes, but I can live without those.) This ommission is ridiculous as the running time for this CD is just over 59 minutes. They could have easily included ""And..."". This is just some kind of stunt to get people to join Sony's Rhapsody service. Feh, I say!"
3,Well . . .,"I like the more complete aspect of this recording. But, come on, a Broadway score is not a recording that deserves to have different editions of the same product available dependent upon the seller. It's very unfortunate ""And..."" is not included on Amazon's version.Using iTunes, I've created a hybrid recording using the more complete versions of the group numbers, but sticking with the OBC versions of ""I Can Do That,"" ""At the Ballet,"" ""Sing,"" ""Dance: 10, Looks: 3,"" ""The Music and the Mirror,"" and ""What I Did for Love."" That's an enjoyable listen."
2,"Idiotic Omission (AGAIN) of ""And...""","Why would they release a new recording of this musical, with restorations, and STILL exclude the song ""And...""? I cannot believe it. It seems like such a no-brainer to me that fans of the musical (and the revival) would want this song. It's annoying enough that the first recording, thirty years ago, eliminated the song, but the fact that it's happened a SECOND TIME is unforgiveable. I never would have bought the recording if I'd known this was going to happen because, frankly, the rest of it is just so-so. This is pure idiocy on the part of whoever made this decision. Way to go, geniuses."
1,"New, but Bland","Don't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have A CHORUS LINE back on Broadway. It is also wonderful to have this new recording, which is essentially the entire score. It be nice if ""And..."" could have made the cut, but the money hungry producers shouldn't be expected to include that. (Yes, that was sarcasm).The current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only PART of what made it so wonderful the first time around. Michael Bennett's choreography and direction are brilliant, and they alone are worth the price of admission. When the show fails, it fails because of the cast. Unfortunately, most of the flaws have been captured on this recording.Some of the orchestrations are bland and sound ""canned"" (just as it does in the theatre.) The opening number plays at a DEATHLY pace. Charlotte D'Amboise can't sing. It just doesn't work. Get it if you're a collector, but if you're not - save your money.Get the Original."
4,"close, but not superior","This new recording is, of course great because it's the new Broadway cast, but when you compair it to the original cast recording, it pales.Not seeing the show you can only judge the music, and having listening to the original recording for so many years, you get used to its' perfection.On the new recording: the opening number is slower, but then ""At The Ballet"" is too fast. ""Sing"" tries to be funny and looses the charm of the original. ""Nothing"" falls short of the original's performance. The montages are great here, and nice to hear more music than the original. What is good is the finale of ""One"", nice new instrumentation. Overall, the music is crisp, and technology has advanced to make it a good sounding recording, and not to put this recording down, it is a good companion to the ""gold standard""-- the original cast recording, but after listening a couple of times, I'll go back to the original when I want to enjoy A Chorus Line."
3,Full score 10 Album 3,Finally a full score of A Chorus Line. This is wonderful. Sadly the cast and performances fail to reach the sublime heights of the original. The only number that really pops is Dance 10 Looks 3. Worthwhile for the true thatre addict.
2,FLATLINE!,"I Loved this show THEN and NOW to experience live. But sadly the revival recording is not half as exciting as the original even if it does have more stuff. It's too clinical and studied sounding. Repeating the dialogue ruins the flow and becomes tedious after one hearing. It's also magnifies why Miss D'Amboise as Cassie never became a first string star. She absolutely sounds like a cat being tortured. Pinched, horrible nasal voice and there's no hiding it even ion the group songs. SAD. I saw this revival and felt the same about her in the theatre. But the album is worth it for the voice of Tony Yazbeck singing anything."
5,Best Revival 2006,I saw the original and I saw the revival. It was like going back in time. No major changes from the original. Superb
2,Always nice to have another recording of ACL,"Best: Original 1976 cast, #2: Japanese Cast #3 Norwegian Cast #4 Mexican Cast #5 Italian Cast #6 Revival Cast #7 Vienna Cast About the new one: I, for one am not a fan of the new orchestrations (saving money?...smaller pit?...too much synth). Love ""At the Ballet"" The additional montage is just rather tedious to me. As for Ms D'Amboise--boy that girl can't sing. Many vocal coaches in the city...she needs one...also just a tad long in the tooth for the role. Alas. As for them excluding ""And""...it is an amusing song...maybe it's a blessing that it's not included with this cast!"
2,DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT,the original stage production of this was never filmed???????????THIS IS JUST PATHETIC.
1,horrible nonsense,this cd captures all the drab mediocrity of the current mess on broadway-- i have never seen a worse offering on broadway in the fifty years ive been going to see plays-- not one person on stage was attractive to look at-- not one could sing well at all-- and the dancing was just ok i guess-- it was so painful sitting thru this i wanted to run up onstage and just make fun of it all like jerry lewis might have if he was still crazy like that----the idiodtic drama of these non talented desperate people who couldnt entertain their way out of a paper bag was painful to watch----and here it is -on broadway !!!!!!!! yikes-- the end of the world must be near !!!!! stay away from this idiocy the soundtrack and the play !!!!!
1,"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK",I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful. The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah. I don't recomend this at all. If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better.
1,I'll Take The Original Any Day,"The movie was trash. And this revival isn't much better. I saw the original both in Workshop at the Public in NYC and 5 times at the Shubert. AND ... this new revival though I give them all credit for trying ... it just doesn't cut it. There isn't any magic in the mirror. Ed Kleban ... are you rolling over in your grave??? Someone wrote that the arrangements et al were pretty close to the original. Not! There is just something missing here in this production. Perhaps it's the fact that everyone is trying to mirror ... er ... create (re-create) the original. Perhaps it might have been better had they had felt less restricted (in creating a historic theater fable) and had more freedom to get up the energy, drive and passion A CHORUS LINE must have to tell all the stories."
5,Superb 'tour de force',"This is a major contribution to the subject of Islamic law in contemporary Iran. Erudite and philosophically sophisticated. Provide excellent examples on the exchange of Western conceptions of philosophy, hermeneutics and epistemology in Shi'i intellectual debates. The book is indispensible for scholars and everyone interested in Islamic law, Iran and contemporary philosophy."
1,No Product Description,Pic's of bowels make them look like 20 oz. sizes. Bowels are 4 oz. size. No dimensions/capacity listed in description. Bowels are so small that I don't know what I'll ever use them for. Return shipping cost + hassle not worth the effort.
5,Great on cement floors,"I love my new stick vac. I had been using a traditional vacuum, and it was so heavy to lug around. The stick vac works great on our cement floors. We have three cats and it picks up cat hair great."
5,Another great cd from one of the best.,This cd is a remake of his underground classic.I recommend this cd to any fan of underground memphis rap or hardcore rap in general
5,Love It,"I have had to purchase this CD 3 times, I love it so much. The lead singer has a great voice and I never get tired of hearing it. Can't wait for the next one."
2,Disappointed,"Although the content is helpful, this book leaves much to be desired. It had no index and unless you added a bookmark, it was almost impossible to go back and review anything without scanning through the book page by page. I would not recommend this for your Kindle."
2,BEWARE! This is not about learning the language,"This book, while helpful to a degree, is not about learning conversational Japanese.It is more about the customs and mannerisms that are necessary when conversing in Japanese. Very little in vocabulary and grammar is covered, except only in how it relates to small talk and asking for directions and the like. You couldn't actually hold a CONVERSATION with the instruction in this book.If you want a book to help you understand some of the intricacies of Japanese customs (such as what to say when you're the first employee leaving for the day, or what grammar article to include if you're asking an unknown person versus a friend), then this book may help.If you're looking to have more of a long-term understanding of the language, and not intending just a stay of a few days in Japan, then you'll need something more."
1,"Good sound and features, but poor construction","Like others, I had the issue with these breaking at the ear piece swivel. This is from normal (light) usage. Having only used them on a few plane trips over the course of 6 months. These headphones are discontinued. So all Logitech could do is offer me a refund.I also was beginning to have an issue with the sound going in and out on the right side prior to the breakage described above. Too bad about the poor construction.The sounds was good, and nice features while they worked (which was not long). The noise canceling worked well to reduce airplane noise and passenger chatter. The ability to work as normal headphones once the battery is dead, which is a nice bonus. The case is nice as well, which has pockets for the (enclosed) 2-prong airplane jack adapter, and even a pocket for an iPod. I really did like these headphones, too bad they did not last."
1,The swivel/folding frame breaks easily,"I never liked the radio interference with this headset. It even picks up RF from my computer and nearby cell phones, but I continued to use it at my desk to reduce noise while studying. However, in less than a year, the small plastic piece that allows swivel of the ear piece broke when I was trying to adjust for comfort.I am an engineer by profession, so I looked at the joint and realized it was not sturdy enough - a very poor design. I never even traveled with these head phones. Logitech is difficult to contact for support and since I cannot find my receipt, I am out simply of luck.I also noticed this product seems to have disappeared from Logitech web site. Probably because they had so many customer complaints about these problems.This will probably keep me from considering any Logitech products again. I am shopping for different brand of noise cancelling headphones now."
1,Broke in under 2 months,One of the ear pieces broke of the band in less than two months. Very unhappy since these weren't cheap!
5,headphones for casual use,These are very nice headphones. They are very good on sound and also are very comfortable. I just used them on a trip over Easter on a plane trip and they worked great.
1,They broke after 2 days and it is a discontinued item,These headphones sounded great but are poorly constructed. The right ear piece broke after using them two times. I called Logitech and they informed me that it has been discontinued and I would need to send them back for a refund. Sad that it is not listed as being a discontinued item with no warranty support. Beware
4,Great for noisy office,"For the price, these headphones work well and they come with a great zipper case that holds my MP3 player and accessories. They will not work without the battery, however. I have a big head and find them comfortable enough to wear for 3-4 hours. OK, they're not Sennheisers, but the sound is very good.I haven't tried them on an airplane yet. I expect they will keep me from the pounding headaches I've had from engine noise."
4,Bulky but they do the job.,"These headphones did a good job of noise-canceling for the relatively cheap price. While they were pretty bulky, this actually helped to cancel the noise. Plus when you have the feature turned on, there is a red light that glows. This is particularly useful when you go to put them away and realize they are still on."
4,Great headphones,"For the money, I am very pleased with these headphones. They do a great job of cutting out exterior sound and the sound was very good as well. I use them both when I fly and when I mow and it really cuts down on the engine noise so I don't have to crank the music that I'm also listening too. The reason I gave these 4 stars and not 5 is that after 2 years, the sound went out on one side of the headphones so now I just wear my earbuds underneath, but they still do a great job of canceling background noise.I would definately recommend these."
1,Broke the second time I used them,"I think someone else mentioned this -- the connection between the headpiece and the right ear piece broke off when I tried to adjust the headpiece. This means that the right headphone piece doesn't sit up against my ear anymore, which makes them pretty useless.Aside from this problem, the sound quality is pretty bad....Wouldn't recommend these."
2,Great up til they stopped working,"I ordered these headphone on the recommendation of a coworker, and they do work great - at least up until the left side stopped working altogether. I imagine it is a loose connection inside, but I'm not sure I'm up to the warranty process, and not sure who I should start with. It would be nice to buy something and have it work for at least a few weeks."
5,Great Value,I am very pleased wiht these headphones they are a great value and rival the much more expensive BOSE phones. I have used both and rate these as good as the BOSE. I have put these to the test during several flights and they are truly a delight canceling most of the jet engine noise you would normaly hear.I highly recommend these to anyone who is not brand driven and just wants a product that works well and does what it promises.
2,I got these headphones for 57 dollars.,"For that much under the list price I thought, how could I go wrong?Fuzzy noise on high notes. If you enjoy listening to loud music, these are not the headphones for you. When it ""peaks"" on crashing cymbals for example, it buzzes like a broken pair of speakers. The bass notes are very good and the noise canceling is decent. I thought I could use these for monitoring sound with my videocamera, but the slight buzz (sounds like a slight wind) when you turn on the noise canceling feature is counterproductive.My brother has Bose headphones and they handle a wider range of frequencies much, much better. If you're going to spend the money, get Bose. Otherwise, just wait for a cheaper alternative."
2,DESIGN FLAW,"They are fine headphones, except that the swivel piece connecting the earphone to the headset is cheap plastic and breaks easily. I had to put mine back together with a metal bar and tape, so I look like a dork with them on and they do not fit into that cool carrying case anymore. I did not mistreat these things - just tried to extend the earpiece to fit my head and *snap*. I checked other sites and many reviewers have had the same trouble- one cheap piece of plastic ruining an otherwise fine product."
5,Logitech Headphones,"I love my headphones. The Logitech headphones are the first quality headphones I have purchased, and they are great. I use them all of the time, and they are great for the kids..as other headphones typically just fall right off their heads. These are perfect, and affordable."
2,Very Fragile!,"This is my second (and last) pair of Logictech Headphones. After reading a Wall Street Journal review, I bought my first pair. I liked and used them for about 6 months. Unfortunately when storing them in its case, I somehow twisted and ""broke"" the right headphone. The right headphone just dangled like a broken arm in air. Figuring it was my fault, I brought a second pair. Deja vu . On a flight at takeoff (I was requested to turnoff and remove this ""electronic device"") they fell off my lap onto a carpeted floor and again the right headphone disconnected and just like the first, dangled limp. Rather ticked me off. The poorly designed minimal plastic swivel connections are totally inadequate and unable to be reconnected.I like the Logitech Headphones when they work, but please don't buy them unless you will be extremely extremely gentle with them, as they are poorly designed."
2,"not bad, but cheap","got these headphones as a gift about a year ago and just started to use them more frequently. sound quality was better than I thought for what I expected from logitech although I feel the noise-canceling feature was weighted in one ear (the one with the battery) and that produces a hiss which is kind of annoying. Then they started to just fall apart. first a little black square panel. then another piece cracked off. actually have tape on them. Within the next year I'm thinking they'll just turn to dust. There are better headphones out there, but if you are dead set on these they don't sound bad."
4,Great headphones,"These headphones are amazing in how they block out noise. The sound quality is great too. When I turn on the noise cancelling while listening to music, it greatly enhances the sound and is like being in a room with an orchestra. There is a light hissing sound when the noise cancelling feature is on and no audio is input, but that is not bad. I compared these with Bose, and these are close in quality but far cheaper. They are comfortable for long term wearing also."
2,"Fragile, They broke real soon","I bought these headphones for $60 , i thought the deal wasnt that good but i wanted good quality headphones, they sound good not great though, and the worst thing is that they broke within a week or so , cheap plastic , so i would go with another brand like sony or pioneer"
3,Good Sound Poor Construction,"I've been enjoying these headsets for a couple of months. The sound quality is very good the battery lasts a long time and the thoughtful carrying case is perfect for my complete traveling audio needs. They seem to perform almost as well as my *very* expensive headsets I use when flying.One day an ear piece broke off somehow (I don't know how) and on examination, I found that the swiveling attachment point is a very small and lightly built piece of hollow plastic trough which the wires pass. I glued it all back together and the earphones still work well, however they will no longer fit in that nifty case. Too bad."
2,Better choices are available for the money,"I have been on a buying binge to find the right noise-canceling headphones. Sennheiser's PXC-250 sounded okay but the noise canceling was totally ineffective. Audiotechnica ANC7's audio quality and noise canceling were great but they leakage was such that you would share whatever you were listening to with whoever was within 25 yards of you. I returned both and tried the Logitechs after doing much research. The phones are comfortable and the passive noise cancellation works well, but the active noise canceling is nothing to write home about. The audio quality is mediocre at best. All in all, they aren't terrible, but they are way overpriced for what you are getting. At any rate I ended up with the Panasonic RP-HC500s and so far I'm very happy with them."
1,ir broke very easily but had great sound,it sounded and functioned great until it broke at the same weak spot others have mentioned.... the right ear piece swivel point.... I only used it about 8 times before it broke...
2,"Good sound quality, but poor build","Bought this pair of headphones before the Christmas holidays to use for my trans-pacific flights. I jumped on it because tigerdirect has such a good deal on a supposedly quality pair headphones from most of the reviews that I read. I have to say that I am disappointed. The sound quality is decent, but that is about it. One plastic piece covering the wire fell off the 2nd day of my usage. Then, the battery seems to run out fairly fast (I had to change my Energizer battery once every 3-4 hours!). I was thinking maybe I got a defective model or something. I already returned this model and will probably spend more to look for a better brand-name headphone."
2,Cancels noise Poor sound,Does a reasonable job of cancelling background mid & low frequency noise.But sound quality is very poor.I have some $25 old noise cancelling headphones which have much better sound quality.
5,Great Value,"For the money spent, I don't think there is a better value. I've used these headphones to mix music/voice recordings at my church with excellent results.Logitech Noise-Canceling Headphones"
1,humming noise in the right side of headphone,Careful with all the good reviews because I made the choice based upon them. The headphone has a serious flow on noise canceling part. I remember one professional review about this humming sound when you turn it on but did not expect this at all. It burns your ear out simply because it's so damm loud right out of the box. It works turn it off but don't expect high sound quality. My earbud came with HP laptop sounds much better. One star for sturdy case though! Other than that I don't want to waste my time on it. I have to return the same day I got this.
4,good product,I bought these as a gift for my brother who is an author and complained about distaction noises (gardners outside etc). He says they work really well as noise cancelling as well as regular headphones.
3,It has differences between earpieces.,"As others have noticed, the left and right side have different sound qualities. I didn`t find any loose cable, plug malfunction or even a weak battery associated to this problem. It was happening more often in the first day. For some reason, I haven`t noticed it lately. I think it could be something related to the power button. It feels flimsy, but really not sure if that is the cause."
2,"Its not a GREAT speaker soundwize, its just...fine","Its not a GREAT speaker soundwize, its just...fine. But if you are in an airplane or in a noisy environemnt, is gr8. In other words, if ur in a noisy place where listening to music is impossible, this headset is pretty great, but if you are in your room and feel like listening to music, you wont like the sound :)All in all, its a good headset, battery lasts for weeks. Am talking about like 8 weeks, not 1 or 2. Cheers :)"
2,"Good at first, but broke after 2 months","So, I was attracted to these earphones because of the price. They seemed like a great deal but the poor quality construction was evident right off the bat. The first pair that I ordered were broken during delivery (right near the top of the ""U""-shaped arm holding the phones in place) so I had to get another pair. They worked great for about 2 moths but after even gentle handling, they finally broke and are now not usable.I'd recommend them only if you get a *really* great deal, but even then, expect to replace them soon."
1,Buyer Beware...,"I had these for 6 months and they worked well BUT, the right speaker broke off. Since it was Logitech, I figured they'd stand behind their product but, after several emails it was sorta resolved. This is the feed back I got from Logitech's help desk...""I have been informed by the Warranty/Replacement Department that the Noise Cancelling Headphones are refund only.""So BE CAREFUL if they break on you, you'll be paying shipping costs again."
1,flimsy,I used this headphone for only one trip. It broke at the earpiece where you rotate.It does not sit on my ear now and therefore it is useless.I did not read the reviews of moany oithers who experienced the same problem. After spending 75$ I feel cheated and would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Mine Broke :(,"These worked great for about a year, then the frame broke just above the ear piece. That side just flops over now, not sitting snug against my ear and all sorts of sound gets in. They can no longer function as noise canceling headphones. They weren't abused, or dropped, just not much structure or strength in the design in that area."
2,Good earphones but fragile,I found these headphones produce reasonable quality sound and would recommend them except that the folding joint broke on my second flight and trying to get through to Logitech for repairs would make it seem that they are located out of reach of all communication systems.
5,silence in the air,I bought these headphones for one reason and that is air travel. When it is time to snooze and I want some peace and quiet the noise-canceling cuts out all the noise. I would recommend these headphones to anyone.
5,GREAT HEADPHONES!!,I found these headphones very comfortable.. even on long flights.. like across the Pacific. And I found the Noise Cancelling qualities BETTER than my Bose headphones. A Great Product!!
2,Broke after a day of gentle use at the office,"The swivel just above the left ear cup broke, leaving it dangling by the wires. Super glue should correct this, I can do without the swivel action."
3,"Good product, bad cord","For the price, these are excellent, but the low price apparently brought with it some truly cheap components. The headphone to input cord developed a break within the first 10 hours of use, rendering the otherwise excellent stereo sound into considerably less excellent mono sound. Getting a replacement looks to be a bit of a hassle too, as the recessed plug into the headphone unit requires a much narrower than normal jack housing."
3,"Great electronically, weak mechanically","The sound reproduction was very good and the noise cancelling feature worked beautifully. Unfortunately, as other customers have reported, after a year or so both sides broke at the joint just above the earcup. I taped them together as a temporary measure but the earcups are still floppy. If I want to do any serious listening, I have to press them against my ears by hand. There doesn't seem to be enough overlapping material there to make a more permanent joint, and whatever I used would have to withstand a certain amount of bending force as the headband pressed the cups against my ears.I'm hoping to find something from another maker that works as well as these did before they broke."
2,Poor quality,"I received this product as a gift and was very impressed at first. I listen to music at work, and being able to have the noise from other offices cancelled out was great. However, after a few weeks, the wire connecting the headsets to the Mp3 stopped working. I contacted Logitech, and initiated a warranty replacement. After a few weeks, which was too long in my opinion, I received my new pair, which appeared to be brand new. Again, things were fine at first, but after a while, I started hearing some crackling in the right ear. It wasn't that bad at first, but now, the headsets are not usable. I am very disapointed with the quality of this product. I was impressed at first, but now, I am looking at a different brand. I would recommend that you do the same."
4,okay,"I like these headphones. But you need to know two things that have already been mentioned in some of the reviews:1) The noise cancelling does not completely cancell all of the surrounding noise. It cancels the low frequencies...but you will still be able to hear other people when they talk to you (if your music isnt too loud). But I like the noise cancelling feature anyway. It also enhances the bass, which I like.2) These headphones are comfortable, but my ears get hot and red after about one hour of listening.Conculusion: Good value for 60Dollars!"
1,These are worthless,I do speakerphone testing and have noise files on my PC. So I play the noise file and conclude that these are pretty much worthless. They reduce maybe 3 dB of noise at best. And it seems to be lower frequency noise. I found these to be an absolute waste of money. I would do 0 stars if they would let me.
4,Decent headphones with decent noise cancellation,"With this product, you're getting what you pay for. Don't expect them to be as good as the higher end noise canceling headphones, but they get the job done. There's a major difference in sound of the music between noise canceling off and on. I would recommend keeping it on all the time, even if in a quiet setting because the music is much better. There's also a noticeable difference in ambient noise when in use. It reduces a significant amount of external noise (mostly in the lower freq.), but you can also here a small amount of static white noise, probably from the electronics in the phone. Overall, they are a decent set of headphones for both using for entertainment and blocking noise."
1,Bad Episode.,"The previous 5 episodes are well worth watching. This one is not. The plot is pointlessly offensive. It lacks delicacy and nuance. It goes out of it's way to engage in silly stereotypes that are so unrealistic they damage the credibility of the characters.As if that weren't bad enough, there's a bunch of badly edited scenes out in the woods centered around a tripwire that make no sense from any point of view. For example, are the writers so ignorant that they actually think freezers run on LN2? And then everyone runs around getting pretend-shot-at like a bunch of LARPers. Then the scene that made me stop watching: the one in which they decide to run away to beat the claymore tripwire... a bad idea to start with, and then made dumber by the fact that a guy who could have walked out at any time doesn't ... presumably so they can have their 'Lethal Weapon' diving away from the bomb moment. ugh. I'm going to pretend this episode didn't happen."
4,Wow--What a Strong Woman,Another great episode in this new series. This episode looks at a lady who was convicted of stabbing her husband 47 times and then escapes from jail but putting on an elaborate ruse through a Prison Pen-Pal system. She gets unsuspecting me to come visit her and essentially help plan her escape where she tries to reunite with her son and then escape more permanently. This show just keeps getting better and better in the first season. Jimmy Simpson as Dr. Lloyd really has come into his own in this show and this episode in my opinion was his real breakout in the series. The discussions with his mother on his cell phone are pricelessly funny. Very worthwhile series.
5,Great Show,"A probation officer I work with recommended this show and I have greatly enjoyed it. The characters are interesting, supsenseful. I particularly like the character of Lowery; childlike in many ways but a genius in others. His perception and then off the wall lack of common sense set up many of the best scenes in the show."
1,Like old pantyhose,"These pantyhose are terrible. They are ruff to the touch. They have no stretch to them. The band rolls and not because they were the wrong size. Because there's no stretch to them after awhile they were like old school stockings, bunching around the ankles. Yuk! I didn't purchase them through amazon. I found them at JCP. I bought 2 pairs and will be returning the second."
2,image,the image shows some print like on the panty hose legsbut the description does not say this item has any type of print on the legs
1,Actually deserves zero stars,"This book is full of glaring errors, and the testing software is ABSOLUTELY USELESS. Everything in the tests is incorrect. You're given questions that ask you to ""select the two methods..."", but are only allowed to select one answer. In addition, the test data is just plain wrong. The software gives explanations for your supposed wrong answers that have absolutely nothing to do with the questions. Complete waste of money.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn anything about Sql Server 2000 or want to prepare for the test."
1,Deserves 0 Stars,"I thought this was an OK book until I took the SQL Server 2000 certification exams. Total trash! Luckily, I had also studied Rob Vieira's book, Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming. Stay away!"
1,Book should be renamed as SQL Server for Dummies...,"I have gone through this book and the chapters are repeated with the same content and the book is just filled with screen shots. I think this would be useful for a beginner and not for someone who is preparing for a professional exam. Hence, the name should be changed to something like ""SQL Server for Dummies"". Also, the author just wanted to fill some pages and publish it in the market and I don't feel he is qualified enough to write a exam book for DBA certification as he himself is not a DBA!"
1,It is useless ...,The book is useless if you want to pass 70-228 and 70-229.*** The CD is worse than the book. The software is buggy. ***
1,Least informative reference book ever,"This book is the least informative reference book I have ever purchased. The book will not help you pass the MCDBA exams (70-228 and 70-229), nor is it a good reference book for your job. First of all, there are many aspects of T*SQL that are missing. For example, how can one write a book about the Select statement without such basic topics as ""Having"" and ""Group By""? Secondly, the information is frequently wrong. Not misinterpreted, but plainly wrong (i.e., SQL*Server will reject your syntax). Finally, the questions in the ""sample"" tests have NO relationship to the actual exams. I cannot think of a book that has provided less true information and more misinformation than this one. If I could rate this book with negative stars, I would do so."
2,Not -At-All-What-You-Need,"I wish I had read the other reviews prior to reading this book, because they are right. This book had me thinking I was ready for the exam, when I was actually far from it.To be fair, this is a decent ""Intro to SQL"", with plenty of hands on exercises. You do need to be able to trouble shoot however, because some of the examples won't work as written.I feel I'm better off having read this book than I was before I read it, but sad to say, I failed the 70-228 exam. And that's after getting a 98% on the ""Final Exam"" included with the book.Oh well, I guess I'll have to find another exam prep book and keep working with SQL. It least it's good to know the exam isn't a cake-walk, and certifications can still mean something."
1,absolutely horrible,"Why didn't I read the reviews before buying it? Because this is the book that the store had, and I wanted to start studying. Ugh. Yet one more reason to buy books at Amazon :)Anyway, the book is full of glaring errors, the questions/answers at the end of each chapter are often mismatched, and you learn very little by reading it. You might even be dumber after reading it. As other reviewers have said: stay away!"
1,Just forty more and we can have a REAL chorus,"1. The software DOES NOT WORK. The answers are often obviously wrong, the hints are not correlated to the questions, it appears the various parts of the exam were written by someone who lacked the knowledge to synchronize them (in a relational database book this is inexcusable). The practice tests have a hard time-out, and when you exit the test it locks-up your machine with an invisible pop-up window.2. The text itself is so unbelievably brief, and so lacking in concrete examples, as to be unusable as either a tutorial or a reference guide. No trace of documentation on any but one feature of DBCC is included; Query Analyzer docs are woefully brief.3. This book will help you FAIL the MCDBA exams. Beyond that, as the other reviewers attest, the content is so off the mark that if you buy it, you will wish you hadn't.4. ""No Stars"" is not one of the valid selections. That's my rating."
4,Sheryl Crow - Try Not To Remember,"I want ""Try Not To Remember"" from Sheryl Crow, and that is the ONLY song on this entire album that is not available for download... it makes no sense!Please make this track available for download!"
2,Disappointing DVD edition,"I saw this film first by ordering from Netflix, then decided to buy. This edition is all black and white, although the film was originally one of the first technicolor films, something Fairbanks worked very hard to achieve. The music score on this DVD is terrible - they play Grieg's Holberg Suite, which is totally out of character and has nothing to do with what's happening on screen. The film itself is great, one of Fairbank's best, but spend a few more dollars and get the Kino Video version."
3,"B&W, not restored color","Although this was one of the first films released in Technicolor, there is no color in this DVD release. The transfer quality is average, at best, and there are not any DVD extras (I was hoping for something about the color version).It's a good movie if you're interested in the silent era, and has some very good stunt scenes. I did find some of the situations unrealistic, not unlike many ""hero"" movies of today."
3,Mossflower,"Mossflower is a good book, but not quite as good as I expected it to be. The characters are fine and the plot is great, but just the way the author set it out was wrong. I think this book deserved a three because it didn't attach to me very well."
5,"Really, really, really, really, really nice!",Cool! I have read this book 3 times! It's so wonderful!
3,mossflower,"Good descriptive author, it is about a clever and greedy wildcat Tsarmina becoming ruler to all Mossflower Woods and is determined to govern the woodlanders with an iron paw. A mouse named Martin and mouse-thief Gonff meet in Kotir Castle's dungeon.The two escape and resolve to end Tsarmina's crule rule. Joined by Kinny the mole, Martin and Gonff set off on a dangerous quest for Salamandastron, where they are convinced that their only hope, Boar the Fighter, if he still is alive."
5,Michael Whatley's review for Mossflower,This book is an excellent thriller with mystery and non-stop adventure on every page. You just can't stop reading this novel of a lifetime.
5,Liked Redwall? This one's even better!,"In Brian Jacques' 2nd book --the prequel to Redwall, he improves on all the flaws of Redwall. He gives the reader a much better and a more believable plot. The adventures are still grand and will stay in your memory for many years!Martin the Warrior, the legendary mouse of Redwall must battle the evil Tsarmina who has done the peaceful villiage of Mossflower wrong. Though she isn't a savage beast, she is more of a ruthless power (like Darth Vader) who is a character you'd think that no mouse could bring down. A wonderful story that is full of surprises. It is also good reading for adults who want to journey back into their childhood!Definitely a reccomended venture for everyone; I absolutely loved it!"
3,Fair entertainment for a night or two,"Maybe I've come a too long way from my childhood to really love these books the way they should be loved. Still I thought Redwall was original and interesting, and while this, let's say, prelude lacked some of the anarchy and wildness, it was a good adventure - much more action-packed than Redwall, although I don't think that's so important in these stories. It all comes down to Jacques' writing style and great sense of humour. I'm not sure how many books can be drawn from this setting, but so far I have nothing to complain: if I had children, I would surely make them read these books."
5,I LOVED IT!,I love this book! I Hope to read more of the REDWALL series.I think there is an interesting plot and twist of characters.I wish the Mask wouldn't die.I really liked Martin the Warrior and Gnoff!
5,Best Book: Mossflower,"Mossflower was the best book I've ever read. Some people say things like ""Adventurous, exciting, and wonderful"" about other books but that's pretty much a perfect thing to say about Mossflower. Tsarmina was pretty much why it's better than Redwall."
4,Mossflower,"My grandmother gave me the first three Redwall books for christmas years ago. I avoided reading them until the car ride to her house months later (what if she asked me what they were about?)and I haven't stopped. With all of the rich details, thrilling fights and involving characters of a classic epic tale, Mossflower is an exciting and engaging story about the good, the evil, the weak and the strong. Don't fall for the adolescent male stereotyping that the Redwall books have often endured- this is a book for boys, girls, men, and women. (not for children under say, 6 or 7, the battle scenes are fairly realistic but suprisingly not disturbing as they are short and hardly gruesome)"
5,Marvelous!,"Mossflower is my favorite Redwall book in the series that starts with Redwall and as of now ends with Marlfox. Mossflower is the foundation for all the other Redwall books. It tells of the epic battle where the woodlanders of Mossflower Woods, led by Martin the Warrior, Gonff the Mousethief, Skipper the Otter, and Lady Amber the Squirrel, fight to gain back their freedom that was taken from them by the evil Queen Tsarmina the Wildcat. In this adventure, you will find that you get into the story as one of the woodlanders! I know everyone that reads this book will agree with me that Mossfllower is a great book."
4,Very Good Book,"Mossflower is by far Brian Jacques' best work. It is somewhat remenescent of Robin Hood with it's rebel heroes (remarkably warrior mice) and tyrannical villains (interestingly wild cats and foxes). The reason I did not give this book a 10 is that the charactars are somewhat shallow.The hero is a bit too heroic and the villain is a bit too villainous. It could use a few more 'shades of grey', but it's nonetheless a great book.Don't be fooled by the mice and cats in this book, this is a violent book, but somewhat lighter than Brian Jacques' other works.I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Absolutely Perfect! Completely original!,"I have never read a book like Mossflower. I got it from one of my friends for my birthday and I thought it would be too long to read. I had to do a book report and was reading Mossflower at the same time as my book for my book report. It ended up that I didn't like my other book at all and asked my teacher if I could change to Mossflower. She said that was fine and so I started reading more of it each day. One night I read until midnight! I loved how realistic it was. It really felt like you were right there. I could feel myself scared when Tsarmina plugged up the tunnels. I was curious when the hares took the four wanderers to Salamandastron. Some of the things that happened were totally unexpected, like at the end,but I won't tell what happens! You'll just have to read it yourself!"
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK!,"The woodland creatures of Mossflower have been under the rule of Verdauga for many years until the day his evil daughter, Tsarmina kills him and takes over the throne. She plans to make the woodlanders her slaves and treat them cruelly and ruthlessly. But, when a brave young mouse,named Martin the Warrior comes to Mossflower the woodland creatures realize he is their only hope. This is a great story and I think it's better than Redwall but maybe that's because I read this book before Redwall. A definite must-read!"
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!,"I haven't read all of the Redwall books in the series, but I have read most of them, and this one is definitely my absolute favorite! The other ones are just amazing with wonderful stories of good against evil and the Redwallers saving their abbey. This one, though, tells about how they freed their land from tyranny and claimed it for their own to make it a peaceful place to live and that is why I like it best. When people ask me what it's like, I tell them, ""It's kind of like Braveheart, only with animals."" Brian Jacques does amazing work on these books. They are all so descriptive that you feel like your standing in Mossflower looking around. It is truly incredible to read. And, just as a side note, I think the animation on these books is just so cool looking. It gives you a good interpretation of Jacques' description of the land and characters. Bravo!"
5,Mossflower is unbeatable!!,"Zack's Rating:99%This unbeatable tale takes off when Queen Tsarmina becomes Queen of a thousand eyes and rules Mossflower in her headquaters, the battered old castle Kotir. The woodlanders must try to liberate the beloved Mossflower from tyranny. Martin the Warrior, Gonff the Mousethief, and Dinny the mole make a quest to recruit a huge badger named Boar the Fighter from Salamandastron mountian to ensure victory..."
4,An All in All Good Book,"A good book and a must-read if you are planning to read the Redwall series, but not my favorite at all. I feel that even though it aquiants you with the characters, it was a tad boring in some places (not all of course) and Redwall itself along with the newest book, Pearls of Lutra, are much better. All in all, a great book"
5,My favorite book of the Redwall Series.,"Mossflower is an adventurous account of the woodlanders struggle to regain their homeland from the evil Wildcats. The lead character, Martin, is a mouse with a true warriors spirit. He comes to free Mossflower of the evil tyranny that has engulfed it. Overall, this book a great fantasy for any age, young or old"
5,THE BEST!,This was the BEST Redwall book I have ever read. It has the most fighting and action in it too. Belive me I have most almost all the series. But I really don't like the part Martin lies about his past. Still I guarrentee you this book is FUN!
2,Almost as bad as Legend of Luke...,"This book... stinks. This book... is not good. This book... I'll stop now. As you probably guessed from the title, I don't like this book. I never will. It is dull in comparasin to other of Brian's greats such as Mariel of Redwall, or Redwall for that matter. As one can come to expect, the baddies are helpless jerks. They attck each other in the middle of the knight, and rush out of doors that they know have arrows flying at them. The only half bright bad guy is Bane, a leader of a group of mercinaries. There is a totally needless insertion of a half blind eagle into the book who dies without doing any damage. [Well, he takes Bane with'im]. I fail to see how a giant wildcat can be scared into death by a mouse. This book is as exciting to read as it is to watch paint dry."
2,Inflated Reviews,I had read Redwall and enjoyed it greatly. This book was very disappointing. It was so slowly paced I have not read any others in the series despite strong recommendations from friends. I'll take Tolkien.
5,Jacques is a master at fantasy literature...,"The dominating (in my personal opinion) Redwall series has to be the best fantasy ever written! Jacques has a pure talent for giving animals human characteristics. This was the first book in the series that I read, and I absolutely loved it! Jacques' creativity was spectacular and the characters were witty and great. If you like to read fantasy books, DO NOT pass this book up!"
5,It was a master piece that had animals as main characters.,It was about a land that was waiting for a hero. A land that needed to get away from their evil ruler. The girl wild cat cheated her way into inheriting her fathers kingdom instead of her brother inheriting the kingdom.
5,"Very,Very Good! The best Redwall yet!","""You should have killed me when you had the chance, because I vow that I will slay you one day!"" Mossflower is a good book, with two storylines at once, one in Mossflower Woods where Lady Amber and the squirrel archers and Skipper and his otter slingers fight Tsarmina, Lady of a thousand eyes, and the other with Martin the Warrior and co. on their journy to Salamandastron to find Boar the Fighter. This book sets the stage for The Outcast of Redwall. I suggest that you read all of the Redwall books. All of them are 5 stars!"
3,A nice record for Clapton fans,"When I started listening to Clapton, I bought every record from the 70's and 80's with the exception of this one, which at the time I was unable to find in any store. So, when I saw it in the Amazon promotions, I didn't hesitate in buying it. In resume, it's definitly not one of his best records but it also isn't one of the worst. It's easy to listen and has some well constructed songs. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual Clapton listener, but if you're an admirer then it surely is a nice item to add your collection."
4,Yes.,"A very fine album. Judging from the reviews it is getting here, though, it apparently is very much overlooked!While Slowhand is better, this is DEFINITELY worth adding to your collection if you are a Clapton fan.Enjoy."
4,I Told'ja So!,"This is just another example of how Eric Clapton was a victim of expectation. The poor guy got slammed so many times by reviewers because he didn't record the kind of songs they wanted him to at the time. But this disc has weathered time very well and it supports what I told my friends back when it was released in '78: this is good stuff. Not his best, perhaps, but more than worth a listen. ""Watch out for Lucy"" is a catchy pop tune and ""Roll It"" is an interesting song that might not sound like EC to many listeners but I still like it. The highlights for me are ""If I Don't Be There By Morining"" and ""Tulsa Time"", both excellent funky tunes. It's interesting to compare these studio versions with the live versions on ""Just One Night"" which were recorded a year later in Japan. I actually prefer the live versions but these studio cuts are also excellent. By the way, the Cd also includes the full length version of ""Early in the Morning"", another excellent tune."
2,No.,"I bought a copy of the vinyl-disc version of this for one dollar at a used record store last year. It has two good songs, the country hit ""Promises"" and ""Watch Out For Lucy"". The rest is not worth listening to once. (Oh, ""Tulsa Time"" and ""Roll It"" are okay, I guess.)Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by JEFF BURNS."
2,not Claptons' Finest,"Not one of EC's best, the 1977 album, Slowhand is much stronger if one wants to hear some Clapton from this era. Just One Night is also a better option as it contains several live versions of songs from Backless."
2,Not EC's best,"Compared to his greatest CD's incl. Slowhand and others, Backless is little more than a mistake. Its title refers to Clapton's description of Bob Dylan, that he had eyes in the back of his head, that he was in fact ""Backless."" This CD is obviously under the influence of alcohol and God-knows-what-else and it shows. Only Golden Ring, again written for Pattie Boyd (ie ""Layla"") shows some heart. Skip this one for one of his greatest hits packages."
3,Classics from Hot Record Society,Great music but only 32 minutes? . . pity the Rex Stewart Big Seven titles from the samesource could not have been added . . poor sound on the P W Russells is probably thefault of the original recording.
2,could be great if only...,"-they hadn't designed it to attach to your phone with a coiled wire. why not just a shorter straight wire? i wanted a retractable thing so that i wouldn't have to fight with the wire anymore. i'm still fighting it.-it weren't as big as my phone-the earbud weren't so delicate. the only reason i'm still using it is because, after the first one i bought utterly failed after about 10 minutes of use... and i argued with customer service for an hour or two, sent it back to nokia, and demanded my money back... they then sent me a new one. this one still works after a year... but i'm careful with it when i argue with the wire."
2,Looks great but wont fit BMW keyfob,Well isnt the #1 job of a BMW key chain to fit a BMW keyfob? The slot in the keyfob is too small to insert the ring into it. You have to get a second smaller ring and attach that to to the keychain ring. Otherwise the keychain looks nice and is made with quality.
2,Not the best movie.....,"I had seen this movie before and I thought I really liked it so I ordered the DVD. I was pretty disappointed once I watched it again, though!"
4,howards end,"good pic, ordered it for xwife. she wanted it and is now enjoying it. it came as agreed. the price was good."
5,"A beautiful, truthful, faithful, perfectly rendered work of cinematic art","This is, in my estimation, the most faithful transfer from a novel I have ever seen. The acting is superb and the cinematography and direction gel into one of the most rewarding movie experiences I have ever had. I own the DVD and find that I constantly come back to it to see not just a good story, but one that is masterfully put together. I suppose Ang Lee is responsible for this. If this genre is to your taste, then ""Howard's End"" should be at the top of the list. See it and I hope that you come away from it with a similar reaction. Some people just miss the point of it all, and that is a sad commentary on the human race."
1,Disappointed,"5 stars for the movie. One star for this disc. I bought this to upgrade from the previous release on DVD which was a very good quality DVD. As this was Criterion and Blu-ray I expected the best print yet of one of my favorite films. To my disappointment this disc if full of snowy grain and flickering in any of the darker scenes. The opening shot of Vanessa Redgrave walking around the house in the evening is ruined with a blizzard of snowy grain. Some of the scenes have a grid-like band across them. I am assuming this is from a defective batch as I see other people are having similar problems. Yet other people seem to not have problems so obviously not all discs released are bad. I, however will be returning this piece of junk. If there is a better disc out there I would like a replacement otherwise I just want a refund."
5,Howards End DVD,"For those who enjoy period pieces, excellent movie and terrific cast. Hopkins and Thompson are always a terrific pair."
5,"Great Film. Actiing, Script & Sets-Superb.","THIS movie is quality film-making at its best. Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson (who won an Oscar for this film, Helena Bonham Carter & Vannessa Redgrave (in what's teally a cameo) star in this opulent film version of E.M. Forster's novel. The script is superb. The acting,, sets and everything e;se about this movie is wonderful. I wish Hollywood would STOP MAKING TRASHY FILMS LIKE ""Knocked Up"" and get back to making more films like ""Howard's End,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Ben-Hur"" and other classic films. This excellent, family-friendly movie SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RATED PG, as there's nothing offensive in the film. Beautiful movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,BORING!,"Don't get me wrong. I love period pieces. I loved ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""A Room With a View"", ""Remains of the Day"", etc.... This one, however, escapes me. I keep telling myself I need to see it again because so many out there seem to love it. It almost put me to sleep. I've seen Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, Helena Bonham Carter, as well as Vanessa Redgrave better in so many other films. I personally found Thompson's performance rather dull and Bonham Carter, I felt, was close to terrible. Oh well. I'll check it out one more time and if I was wrong I'll change my review. However, if I wasn't, I certainly will add to this pan. See ya."
1,2.5 hours of mediocrity,"***Full disclosure - I'm a film student***I just watched the movie, it was very difficult to force myself to watch the entire thing.I have never seen a more dull movie. I had to take several breaks to go do something more interesting.I really cannot fathom how anyone found this film to be exciting, interesting, or in any way memorable."
1,Pathetic!,"If you like watching a continuous downhill slide, this is the movie for you. The central characters are a bunch of pathetic, utterly passive and helpless victims who you know from the first moment are going to get screwed, and that is what you end up watching for the next 2 hours. Sure there's wonderful cinematography and acting, but the story and characters themselves are simply nauseating!"
1,Simply terrible!,"As an Anthony Hopkins fan, I rented this acclaimed film. IT WAS AWFUL! The acting was pretty good, but the story did not ascend, it descended! It was way too long, and, consequently, a movie that achieves only one good thing: MANAGING TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP!"
5,"Exquisite, enthralling.","This is not a dull film. It is subtle, and beautiful, glowing with color. From the first shot of Vanessa Redgrave's skirt trailing through the flowers, I was gripped. It builds upon layers and layers of the human soul, and leaves your mind reeling even after the movie is over. Merchant and Ivory truly understand the importance of all aspects in excellent film: beauty, coherence and subtlety. This is on my list of top ten films, and is in every way what a film should be."
4,Howards End,This movie gave me just over one and a half hours of blissful quiet time. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson are such wonderful actors who take you into the movie with them. I found the pure goodness that came from Emma Thompson's role quite special. There should be more movies like this one. I loved it.
1,Terrible blu-ray transfer of a fantastic film,"For those of you who already own this movie in SD, save your money on this Criterion release. It is horrible, nearly unwatchable in places ~ like watching a movie through a curtain. Criterion should be ashamed of themselves for resting on their laurels.Amazon should STOP importing comments from other releases and media when giving stars to a specific item. The well deserved 5 star ratings from the SD disc are making it look as if this blu-ray release is being well received, which is not the case. Of the 65 5 star reviews posted to date, I counted only THREE which were written for this horrific blu-ray release by Criterion. The other 62 are from the prior SD, VHS and Merchant-Ivory Collection releases.Buyer Beware with this Blu-ray release. Apparently we can no longer assume that Criterion = Good Quality."
4,Best-Looking Of The Merchant-Ivory Films,"Being a man who appreciates beauty and great visual movies, I have checked out all the Merchant-Ivory films. I found this to be their prettiest, just stunning in its beauty.Story-wise, I preferred ""The Remains Of The Day,"" but this was okay. It just didn't have the appealing characters ""Remains"" had and it was a little too soap opera for my tastes but the visuals made up for that, ...and the story, to be fair, was solid and involving.It also had Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, and those two make a great pair. I would never get tired of watching either of these great actors, especially when they are together.If you like period pieces - this is 1910 Edwardian England - along with fabulous sets and scenery, a solid cast, and an involving story, you'll like this. If you are a fan of melodramas then you'll really, really like this!"
1,Blu Ray image quality worse than DVD!!!,"I pre-ordered this BluRay and to my disappointment, at certain spots, e.g. at several outdoor scenes, I see severe pixelation and 'snow storm; artifacts. Why pay extra to see an inferior image? I wonder if it is the remastering or this particular disc I got, but this kind of quality is deeply disappointing. I certainly had no such problems with 'A Passage to India' and ' A Room with a View'. My BluRay player is a top of the line machine so I am sure it's not my hardware. So what's wrong?"
1,BLU-RAY IS HORRIBLE - NEARLY UNWATCHABLE!,"This is one of our favorite films, so were were naturally excited to be able to order it on Blu-Ray - particularly with the boast that the cinematographer supervised the transfer. Sadly, it's an absolutely atrocious transfer. We thought we'd just gotten a defective disc, and had Amazon send us another. But, the problems were the same with both discs. Basically, every scene that isn't in bright sunlight (and there are many) is nearly unwatchable. It's filled with the most distracting ghosting and video noise. Absolutely appalling. Furthermore, and equally maddening, the sound isn't quite synced correctly. It's not off enough to seem completely wrong, just enough to drive you slightly mad. I'm really shocked. I've never had this happen with a Blu-Ray, and never had to write a review like this. Do not buy this item!"
1,for the blu-ray. 5 stars for the film.,"Despite what some deficient Amazon reviewers and Criterion say, this blu-ray release is a disaster. There is ""snow"" (digital noise, NOT film grain) and image jittering throughout the entire film. Either the mastering or disc manufacturing was defective. I have played three copies on two blu-ray players and the problems were always the same. However, the real reason I am writing this review is to recommend that it be played at 720p instead of 1080p. The definition is not the same of course, but all the visual problems disappear."
2,"Yes, the blu-ray disappoints","I bow to no one in my love for this film, based not only upon its obvious merits but also the Forster novel it is faithfully based on. (Some reviewers don't seem to be aware of this original source.)But, having labored mightily to calibrate both my LCD tvs properly, I must add my voice to those who have problems with this transfer.None of my other Blu-rays seem to have such soft processing nor do they seems as unfaithful in terms of color.I remember an astonishingly beautiful film. Perhaps the actual film stock M/I used was subpar, turning many fleshtones pink and lacking the warmth one would expect from proper color temperatures. It's a disappointment from Criterion.It's always possible that a cost-conscious producer made the original decision to utilize inferior film stock, but I somehow doubt it."
1,Did not watch it yet !,"I bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She had been looking for it everywhere. I waited for the price to drop and it never did ..... why ? Is this movie that great ?? First of all, it has a few different names, descriptions and covers which confused me a bit, but she said it was the right movie and enjoyed it, which is all that matters."
4,Way better than the book,"I thought this movie was going to suck because I had to watch it for school. However, I was pleasantly suprised, the casting was great and didn't really have that old movie feel to it. This was one of the few cases where the movie was better than the book."
4,Still an interesting film just over long,"Normally I would not be interested in a film like this.I just happened to watch it on cable in the 1990's and thought it was interesting.Story really of three families. Yes, you do have to count the Bast's. I did not like those characters the Bast's. Feel sorry for them because they kept doing things wrong. Leonard was mad at the world. No, not for me.Emma did deserve her Oscar for the role.The whole story with these families based on a house in the country. You just have to watch it. Yes, everything in the film based on his house.The one thing I fault the film on is being over long.This is an early DVD so NO extras on it.Good to see the film wide screen."
5,A masterpiece,"Excellent in all categories, a real classic worth viewing over and over again when new perspectives surface. Anthony Hopkins is a master and one of my favorites in any genre."
2,Blu-ray transfer awful,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews, the picture quality of the Blu-ray transfer is abysmal- grainy with dark colors and snowy at other times as though viewing through gauze...Criterion should be ashamed. Otherwise an excellent period piece."
3,Digital Gliches,"Although Howard's End is a favorite movie, this DVD version of it is not. On a standard single play Sharpe DVD player, this DVD has sound and video pauses and hesitations throughout the feature. This is the first DVD I have ever had this problem with. Playing it on a neighbor's player resulted in the same jerky sound and video. I don't know the reason why this occurred, but it ruins the viewing experience of the movie."
3,an over-rated Merchant-Ivory film,"I have usually found that most of the Merchant-Ivory films tend to be over-stuffed, perfectly dull costume dramas which are usually redemned by a fine cast. This film ,unfortunately, is not the exception like ""Room with a View"" or ""The Remains of the Day"" which were at least compelling. Unless you're an Anglophile, there will be little to interest you except for the excellent acting of Emma Thompson in her Oscar winning performance and Anthony Hopkins. In fact there were very few scenes in this Best Picture nominee that resonated in my mind like the Oscar winner that year, another period piece, ""Unforgiven"". Better to watch ""Masterpiece Theatre"" than this dull film."
3,"Great film, splendid bonus features, poor DVD","Other reviewers have already stated that this is a great film, so I have nothing to add here.Most of the bonus features have been produced in 2005 and give valuable insight information. The double interview with Merchant and Ivory is sometimes funny to watch, both of them constantly interrupting each other - they were both very passionate about there work, even so many years later.It says on the DVD cover that the film has been enhanced for widescreen TV sets. Well at least my copy of this 2 disc DVD is definitely NOT enhanced. And it is a sad thing to watch this beautiful film on a widescreen TV set, if it has just been mastered in 1:1,33. Why restore a film but not presenting it in the best possible way.The film deserves 5 stars, but due to the poor DVD, I can not rate it higher than 3."
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","Dragon Inn ranks high among costume martial arts films, and anyone who enjoys kooky, gravity-defying action scenes will enjoy it. The middle sags and the cannibalism subplot doesn't add much, but the battle at the end during a sandstorm is a must-see, as well as a beautifully balletic scene in which Brigette Lin and Maggie Cheung spar. Unfortunately, this ""remastered"" DVD is really just another Tai Seng rush job with a really grainy picture. It doesn't look much better than VHS. This movie deserves better."
2,Drag On Inn!,"The description of this dvd led me to expect a movie like ""Musa"" or ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth""--I'd have even been happy with a movie comparable to ""Crouching Tiger""--this movie isn't up to the standards of any of these movies though. More of a farce than anything close to an ""adventure""-the scenery is wasted with a lame plot that drags on and makes the movie seem about twice as long as it really is. Perhaps if my own expectations had been lower--I wouldn't be so harsh on this movie--but compared to ""Musa"" or ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth""--it's defintely sub standard. Different strokes--as they say--perhaps you'll enjoy this movie--I didn't!"
1,Not pleased.,"I wasn't pleased with this film at all. It didn't have nearly as much kung fu as I thought it would have. It is mainly a drama/adventure movie. It is comparable to Crouching Tiger, but Crouching Tiger still has a better plot and more kung fu fighting scenes. Donnie Yuen is not even in the movie that much. He doesn't even fight untill the last 15 min. of the movie (which is realy the only 15 min. of the movie worth watching). This is one of those movies that you watch when you need something to help you fall asleep. Oh, and did I mention that it is a fantisy movie. The kung fu that they do in the movie is a bunch of flying around and throwing darts at each other. If there is anyone out there that wants a ""like new"" copy of this movie, E-mail me and I will consider a trade. $9.99 sounds like a reasonable selling price to me."
5,A fun romp in the desert...,"Brigitte Lin is beautiful and deadly as ever in this fun sword film. Donnie Yen plays the bad guy, a refreshing change from his usual roles. Awesome swordplay and a great (if brief) love story. This one's a nice addition to your martial arts film collection. Besides, it has Brigitte--isn't that enough? :P"
2,Where is the remastered picture ?,"This film is very good, one of the best produced by tsui hark, with a good martial art director and two of the most enjoyable actresses in Hong kong. So why two stars out of five. The editor say it's a remastered picture!!!!!!!! When you watch the DVD you know it's not true and that's the big problem. I was waiting for this film to be released in DVD to have a great quality of image and I d'ont have it. I'm very dispointed. So o out of 5 stars for tai seng."
3,B movie with Chopsticks,"This is not a Yuen Wo-ping masterpiece but a good cheesy throwback to the Shaw days when the audience in the theater and not the critics at the film festivals mattered most. Order the Chinese, pop the corn, stop trying to understand and enjoy."
2,Fun flick but poor quality DVD,"For a movie that is relatively new (1992), and for $17.99, I certainly expected the quality to be right up there with Crouching Tiger or Flying Daggers. Disappointed! I do have a number of older - seventies - Chinese movies on DVD that are much worse, mind you, but those older movies were usually less than ten dollars, often closer to five.The movie itself probably warrants four stars, but again, the price for this ""bootleg"" quality DVD is about double what it should be."
5,two words: awe... some,"brigitte is great. maggie is charming and funny as ever. the really weird thing is, the final sword fight in the desert, that cool, tracking shot down the dune, TOTALLY reminds me of qui-gon & darth maul fighting on tatooine. hmmm. RECOMMENDED. highly. otherwise, look for a lot of fighting/spying/misunderstanding/espionage-type shenanigans. really really good, and the NEW IMPROVED dvd format is much appreciated. the running commentary is really good. ALTHOUGH they still don't include cool printed booklets with the dvd packaging. which bums me out. totally."
5,Amazing,"I have been using this book to teach my 5 year old to read, she was having a hard time with reading until we started using this book. She is now excited about reading because she is reading the words on her own. It really helps build the childs confidence. Even my 3 year old is starting to read with this program. I highly recommend it to everyone teaching there child to read."
4,fascinating and challenging,Ada Moore has a deep voice that not everyone will appreciate. But she uses it like a musical instrument. I find what she does fascinating. Wish she had recorded more.
1,"Surely, one of Tal's worst recordings, very uninspiring.","You can't find find a more enthusiastic Farlow fan than me, but I couldn't wait for this CD to finish. All performers sounded very uninspired, almost as if they were playing the arrangements for the first time, and they probably were. The quality of the recording was atrocious -- it sounded as if it was recorded in somebody's garage, with a cheap recording microphone placed far away from the group. This is as bad as it gets."
2,Customer servive info WAS WRONG,"These pads are great - BUT WHO CARES IF THEY R ""PC OR MAC"" compatable - they DO NOT MAKE SOFTWARE FOR THAT!! _ Customer servive said this GAME ""software"" would work - I would have bought these pads but not this software - and as for WWD - World Wide Distributors - they were rude when I called about return - I had to eat my $$ and by a used Xbox or return the entire product at a loss of at least $40! I will never order anything that is coming from WWD again."
5,Very expensive-YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!! AAA+++++,"I have all of the Taylor as well as the Trumper creams, both I consider excellent. I also happen to have extremely sensitive skin. This said, did I mention, I severly dislike nicks which are hard to avoid during a careless moment with a feather blade. With this underpackaged product small mistakes are forgiven. The only cream I literally treat as a soap with my brush, (kind of hard) which I really don't mind because the Trumper cream, (which I also love) is the same weight as this product and shave for shave will last half (or there abouts) as long.This is a great cream and I fully intend to try there other products. So should you if possible, you won't regret it."
5,A Writer's Best Friend,"This book is the best guide to writing a book proposal on the market. It has been updated since the first edition, and contains all the information a writer needs to write a marketable book proposal. I edit books for a living, and have recommended this book to prospective authors for years."
4,Must be good--it worked for me,"I read this book through a few times and wrote a proposal loosely based on the guidelines therein (along with doing my own thing when my instincts told me that what was in the book was not going to work for me specifically). I sent it cold to 16 publishers. Two offered freelance work, and one made me an offer and is publishing the book. It's a travel guide--not fiction. In any case, I found the book helpful. It was a good resource to turn to since I didn't know anyone who had personally gone through the process. It kept me company, offered solid advice, and I recommend it."
4,Getting Beyond the Slush Pile into the Hands of the Right Editor or Agent,"From your ""subject hook"" right through to the ending prologue Michael Larsen provides valuable tips, examples, probing questions, and quotes from the experts to help the reader prepare a successful book proposal.I found the following topics especially interesting and helpful:* Test-Marketing Your Book* Making Your Proposal Stand Out* Promotional Efforts* Mission Statement and Platform* Suggestions for Creating a Proposal for your GenreLarsen's writing is practical, well organized, and clearly articulated. This is a book that will help you get beyond the slush pile into the hands of the right editor or agent."
4,Helpful guide,The book is an excellent step-by-step process for writing a book proposal. Now if I could just get my proposal written!
3,"I'm going to write ""How to Write a Book About How to Write a Book Proposal"" and give it to this book's author.","This book is full of helpful information, but man is it boring. Every chapter is about twice as long as necessary, the text is dry and bland, and whole chapters seem completely uneeded.If you are writing a nonfiction book, however, this would probably be a very smart book to read. If you can slog through it, there's a wealth of useful information hidden inside.And if you're writing fiction...eh...this probably wouldn't be so useful then. There's not too much on fiction in here."
3,beware,The music is great but don't be confused this is not the debut LP but a greatest hits collection
3,A mixed bag,"Van Morrison + Them were an excellent rock `n' roll team, 1964 - 1966, as demonstrated by 8 of the songs on this anthology. (Three of those songs are also offered on the very enjoyable original album Them Again - see my review if you like rock `n' roll!) On this album, their slow blues treatments of ""The Story Of Them"" by Van Morrison and ""Stormy Monday"" by T. Bone Walker are not very inspired. Their rendition of ""Richard Cory"" by Paul Simon is just plain weird. Especially good are Them's (first-ever, best-ever) lively rendition of Van Morrison's ""Gloria,"" the jazzy ""I Put A Spell On You"" (also on the CD Them Again), and their slow and melodic rendition of John Lee Hooker's ""Don't Look Back."""
4,Golden Oldies,Happened to be watching TV when I heard music from the British rock group THEM and brought back many memories of high school in the early 60's. Had to purchase the CD so I could reminisce in my own home. Love it.
2,The vinyl album is much better,"There is a richness to the original vinyl format that is not manifest on CD. In addition, someone fiddled with the album cover. It's not the same. They should not have done that. I've been a Van Morrison fan for about 34 years now. If you really want to appreciate THEM, try the original vinyl with a decent turnatable (maybe a Dual 1019).. a quality stylus (perhaps a Shure V15 Type II), and some Fisher XB7b's (Avery Fisher, that is, not the post 1975 garbage). Gently drop your tone arm on track two on side one, MYSTIC EYES, the best Van Morrison song ever, and turn up the volume... LOUD! Forget this CD they're pushing."
3,Inferior to the Annual,"This compilation is just like the Annual, it contains the same songs, but an inferior mix of them. If you like these songs, I suggest The 2005 Annual."
4,"Stellar musicians, mesmerizing music.","Before our self-styled culture vultures & Fachmaenner smacked us with ""New Age"" & ""ambient"" to describe music, there was Oregon. Tight folk melodies & ripping jazz improvs. I think the first tune I ever heard by Oregon was Tide Pool.Later, when I needed more than what I heard on the local jazz stations, I actually bought albums. The Oregon CD was one of my first CDs.It's standard Oregon fare, although if you connect the title Impending Bloom with the synth siren @the end, you'll easily wind up with goosebumps.I'll never understand why Oregon music doesn't show up in more movie soundtracks: listen to The Rapids.I have Roots in the Sky & Out of the Woods on CD. The two releases by Oregon alumni that I'd like on CD are Towner's (& Abercrombie's) Five Years Later & Introducing Glen Moore. You can't go wrong with Oregon, together or apart."
5,Sound Quality is Near Perfect,"ECM is a quality company, they care about how their products sound. Some record companies believe that the way to get people to listen to their products is to make them as loud as possible through certain mastering techniques such as massive dynamic range compression. Not ECM. This disk has been handled the way an Oregon cd should be handled: with care and respect. If you are at all concerned about sound quality rest assured that this is a quality disk."
1,What happened to Oregon?,"It seems that the great fusion band has given itself to noodling... There are only two listenable, engaging compositions on this album - The Rapids and By The Brook, which are classic Oregon - lyrical, expansive, melodic. The rest of the tracks (I won't call them songs) are little more than experiments in atonality, which exist on every Oregon album, but not in such great numbers. Usually there is more variety - you get three or four lyrical, beautiful group pieces, a couple of equally pretty duets, a piano or guitar solo piece, a jazzier tune, and a couple of noodlers which go nowhere. Well, this album is jam-packed with the latter, unfortunately. I am not against dissonance, you find some of it in many excellent Oregon tunes, but unless you love dissonance for its own sake, there is way too much of it here. Probably the worst Oregon album."
3,Strange duck,"Jonathan Richman is a fantastic, strange guy. I love a large percentage of his music, but this album was just a little too Raffi-esque for me. I adore You Can't Talk To The Dude, so I purchased this album just to get a good copy of that song.My favorite by him is Jonathan Goes Country."
4,Give it up,"Having worn out two original 1970 cast albums, it's hard for any other version to live up to comparisons. Whether or not you agree with the pared-down concept, the execution was eye-opening, fresh and contemporary. And no matter how high expectations were built, we still were stunned by Raul Esparza's Bobby - one of the most memorable performances of this generation."
4,Company Re-Imagined,"There are some stunning moments on this recording, especially Raul Esparza singing, ""Marry Me a Little"" and ""Being Alive"". The ensemble work is very satisfying. Beyond the vocal talent, the instrumental accompaniment that is provided by the actors is sometimes incredible (but at other times, mediocre).The least satisfying portion of this show is the deadening dialogue that permeates some of the songs; especially the otherwise wonderful number ""Another Hundred People"". At least this is a faithful recreation of the problem plaguing the Broadway show.The orchestrations by Mary-Mitchell Campbell are masterfully done, they have been crafted to fit the playing capabilities of the actors (and part of the fun of the live stage performance); listen to ""What Would We Do Without You?"" towards the end and realize that there are only a handful of actor/musicians playing instruments while the rest are singing. It is brilliant! I would highly recommend this recording."
3,Company is okay!,"This CD is okay. I was not blown away. It does not depart too far away from the original cast. I expected it to be more current, but it still feels very dated."
2,Disappointing Orchestration & Vocal,"Economics no doubt dictated the size of the orchestra and thats too bad. As someone who grew up on the original recording with Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations, I am forever disappointed with the sound of the revivals.The orchestras sound thin and don't have any of the magic coloring of Tunick's genius. Although I love distillations of big works by ensemble orchestras, the sound of the revivals have no appeal to me. Too, its a tough thing to match the voices in the original production and maybe unfair to compare them. It just seems that everyting was just so right with the OBC. Newcomers to Company, however, will no doubt be enchanted by this CD as I was 37 years ago by the original which is so burned into me that I am incapable of enjoying the revivals."
2,Doesn't Hit The Mark,"I have seen quite a few productions of COMPANY including the original on Broadway. Unfortunately, this one doesn't come close to hitting the mark. In fact, it's way off. If the director were trying, once again, to be innovative by imposing his concept for SWEENY TODD onto COMPANY it doesn't work. ANOTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE is perhaps a good example how this fails. Were the singer and the musicians really together? I heard not. It's a tough song and this singer couldn't keep up. Who could be better than Beth Howland anyway (grin). And unless my CD player is failing, a lot of the times the singers sounded quite flat.What surprises me the most is that Sondheim would sanction this. And the weird thing for me is that I enjoyed SWEENY TODD, directed by the same John Doyle."
3,Get this recording simply for Raul,Raul gives an amazing performance in this recording. The rest of the cast is fine but not spectacular.
4,Loved it,"Loved it as it reminded me so much of going to see the show itself. Had a lot of dialog, and bridges and made it ever so easy to understand whether you'd seen it or not. Everyone was in wonderful voice. Raul Esparza is the most moving Bobby I've every seen, and I go back to the original."
1,BADBADBAD,"This is such an abysmal show. Yes, Stephen, we understand that you can write music, but next time, try to get a lead who can actually sing that music. The first song I listened to on this soundtrack was Being Alive, sung by Raul Esparza, and I had to switch it off. Unfortunately, after taking a breath, I had to turn it back on again, 1. for morbid fascination, and 2. because I had to learn it. Needless to say, I decided to do a different song. If you want a good musical, go get [title of show], a brilliant new musical comedy. If it has to be Stephen Sondheim, try Into the Woodsor Assassins (the revival). And if you just want a musical in which people both sing and accompany themselves, the revival of Sweeny Todd with Patti Lupone is AMAZING. Save yourselves the pain that is this musical."
4,Company,Excellent production values characterize this latest Sondheim CD. Vocals and instrumentals came through with remarkable clarity so that the words could be understood and none of the Sondheim wit was lost.
3,Company...yes and no,"Yes to the great ensemble sound and the wonderful chamber-music arrangements.No to Raul Esparza as Bobby...a wonderful performer, but on disc at least, very mannered and dull. He over enunciates his words in several of his numbers and never really lets loose. It might work onstage, but on disc it makes Bobby sound extremely boring, and I wonder why these people say he has all of these wonderful qualities, but none of them are evident here (at least in the audio portion of the performance.)Live in performance can make a difference...but, on disc this is not the ultimate cast recording of ""Company"". The original still stands alone."
4,Maybe I am partial to Esparza,I love the revival of this show. I think its a beautiful version of Company with lovely vocals. I might be partial to Esparza but I truly think that this was a great revival. I think its a wonderful rendition of the Sondheim classic.
2,Pathetic,"This recording is passionless; phoned in.I love creative revivals, but this is horrible.The idea of using musicians as actors may have worked in Sweeney, but this is lame.Take some valium instead of listening to this CD, it will have the same effect.How in Gods name did Sondheim approve of this brilliant score being put through this meat grinder?"
1,Company?,"This recording is not great company. I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording? And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage? I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show. The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show. So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it! Some things are just perfect the way they are. Don't buy this CD. I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use."
2,Not so much,"I'm not much into the salsa stuff, and this album is full of it. There are only 2 or 3 songs that are straight up. That being said, I really like Vince and it was probably worth the 10 bucks just to hear him play ""On Green Dolphin Street""."
2,"Pretentious and empty, it's a hollow shell.",I have to offer a dissenting view. Jarrett's playing goes round in circles. He never delivers the goods. This is mood music with pretensions. His vocalized groanings as he plays are distracting and irritating. I attended a solo concert of his in the early 1980s and felt the same way. I think he is way overrated.
5,Simply the best,"Keith Jarret is a must for anyone who likes good jazz, and I find that concert special - the music means more and more every time I listen to it...."
2,Pass,"I truely dislike this solo CD, no matter that it is rated highly in all printed and Amazon reviews that I've read. Jarrett rambles on and on and on and grunts and groans his way to a long and welcomed end. And, it's not very good piano playing either. Were the other reviewers asleep when listening to ""Koln Concert""? I pride myself in being open minded and musically literate but I cannot in good faith recommend this disc. If you want to listen to 1970s Jarrett, please try ""Belonging"" or ""Expectations"". Neither are solo Jarrett but both are excellent. Jarrett is at his best coupled with other great musicians. Also, excellent piano solos by other artists from the same time period include Paul Bley's ""Open to Love"" (ECM/ 1972) and Chick Corea's ""Piano Improvisations"" (ECM/ 1971)."
4,Technically awe-inspiring but ... too many notes?,"It may be sacrilege to criticise the album that broke Jarrett into the jazz bestsellers league, but when I feel in the mood for listening to a Jarrett CD, I almost never pick this one. I love Jarrett's rapid right-hand runs in the group context -- e.g. in 1976's THE SURVIVORS' SUITE, recorded a year after KOLN -- but I find them dizzying in a solo setting.Compare the number of piano key depressions per minute on KOLN with a later work like DARK INTERVALS (1987) or THE MELODY AT NIGHT WITH YOU (recorded in 1999 after suffering the agonies of ME), and you'll likely get a hit rate some four times faster.Yes, I own some New Age CDs by the likes of George Winston and Philip Aaberg, and I rarely listen to those either. Jarrett is streets ahead of both of these, and other jazz imitators like Lyle Mays. But if I want to hear 1970s solo Jarrett, I tend to choose BREMEN LAUSANNE or even wade into SUN BEAR CONCERTS."
4,nice classic solo piano,"This CD made a lot of money for Keith Jarrett, and though I came to it late (recently), it's easy to see why. It's very user-friendly. Jarrett plays inventive phrases throughout, and you hear mini-songs and themes coming and going. You could almost break up ""Part 1"" and with creative editing and looping make 3-5 pop songs. There's almost no dissonance - my wife who finds Freddie Hubbard's ""Red Clay"" abrasive likes the CD. It's not easy-listening in the sense that Jarrett is going for the easy smile, you've got to listen. I can't methodically describe 76 minutes of solo piano the way I could describe a CD with 12 songs, other than to say I recommend this CD, it's a classic for a reason."
4,Inspired improvisations,"Not sure if this is the purported bible of modern solo piano but as far as spontaneous extensions skillfully rendered by powerful force, you'd be hard pressed to find something more captivating. And while it does not all tug at the heart, Jarrett finds his way through many blissfully enthralling segments throughout what is essentially for the love of the search."
5,After about 25 years,..After about 25 years I've come back around to listen to the Kohln concert. It still matches the visions in my brain. What a wonderful experience -even after Bill Evens...
2,Keith Jarrett The Koln Concert,"Dear Sirs,Some time back, I purchased Keith Jarrett, The Koln Concert from you guys. The CD I purchased is not the same as the album I used to have. The album is a double album that I believe is the whole concert. I would like to have the whole concert on CD. Can you guys help me find the whole concert on CD?"
1,Koeln Concert,Its not a review about Keith Jarrett neither his music. I am very disappointed about the recording. I wasn't a vinyl guy before but this CD makes me one. Owning part 3 and 4 since 2o years (part 1 and 2 were burned due to sun exposure) I thougth its time to buy the whole Koeln Concert again. But what I got is for the garbage can. This recording is dead. Nothing left of the spirit of this concert.Don't waste money. Don't buy it.
5,10 Stars,"for a Living Master of the Piano ... I love piano music , from Chopin , to Evans , to Beethoven and Mozart to Meldau and Corea and Hancock , to 20 years of Narada Piano , etc ... and this is absolutelly Fantastic to listen to ... Love It"
5,One great album,"If you ever, and then I mean EVER in your life want to buy a record that celebrates music buy this album. I have listned to it most likely more than 500 times and it just gets better."
5,He never ceases to amaze me,"well, how do i put it...he is as far as i am concerned the complete musician. The first track is I believe a spiritual enlightenment, not necessarily envolving a religious gesture, but a supernatural touch wascertainly over him that day in Koln!! Lyricism ...improvised in such a well honed way, leaving me in tears at the first to 100th listen of this album. Speaking from a much lower place, but still as a up and comming jazz pianist I would safely say this album shows not how he approaches jazz, but how he approaches MUSIC!!, his love and untouchable talent for it. Despite his apparent behaviours on stage or what not, i think if we just listen to what he's trying to say we will all understand a little better where he is coming from."
2,Winston/Storry,"I've heard and bought Jarrett's CDs before and thought them very good. However, there is always, it seems to me, a close link to folks that record on Windom Hill. This recording is joltingly like those on Windom Hill. I don't want to demean folks that record for that label. It's very nice music. It's not jazz!It seems that Mr. Jarrett goes between WH and jazz. To me he's much better in the latter. If I'd heard more of the Koln Concert I woulnd't have bought the CD. Maybe bought the ""The Melody at Night, With You"" again, and sent it to my friends."
2,Torturing a piano,"If you were curious how a verbalist egotripper sounds on piano, then this is the right material for you.Mr. Jarrett had his only bright solo moments at his very first piano parolas (Staircase, Facing you), some good orchestral compositions (Luminessence) and a triple of great jazz ensemble moments (not so incidentally all of them with Dewey Redman behind the sax). And that's all about him- or rather not: Lately he is teasing the ears of classical music fans with some of the most soulless interpetations one can dream about."
5,A highly versatile rendition of turbulent melodies.,"The only time you will hear an artist moan in estasy at the versatility of his own articulation. It's music that you will listen to again and again, from day to day and year to year. It is archtypical rhythmic jazz piano at its penultimate. It's a prize you won't regret...."
5,The Show that keeps on giving!,"This was an awesome season to get! It included the 1hr and 30min episode, ""Acorns, nuts, and dipey butts"" which also was the episode that came before the 2nd Rugrats movie. ""Rugrats In Paris"". This is also the season that introduces Kimi and Chuckie's new mommy, Kira! Its a bunch of fun and is totally reccomended to buy!"
3,A beefier second helping of Kotipelto,"After the musically so-so first album Kotipelto has taken a big stride forwards. 'Reason' the first single, is a catchy and quality song. I actually noticed this track first, entirely skipping the rather tasty lead cut on this disc. Hear it for yourself and make sure you read the lyrics which are a little harder hitting than you might of expected.The rest of the album doesn't stay at this level but there are a number of cool tunes and he has made far more use of the musicians in his band. Any third album will hopefully follow this trajectory because this is a guy who loves his rock and metal and doesn't resort to stupid gimmicks to get your attention, just a good - and still maturing - voice."
4,Not as exciting as Kidnapped; however just as good.,This sequel to _Kidnapped_ does not start out as well as _Kidnapped_; however it soon makes up for it. _Catriona_ takes up the story of David Balfour only one or two days after _Kidnapped_. He must now try to clear his name and the name of James Stewart of the Appin murder. This will not be easy because the Campells want James Stewart to hang.
4,"the ghost-like picture of the ""professional veterans""","Rommel's carreer has always fascinated me. He seems to personify the near perfect leader, although he of course has his flaws. His own account (Rommel Papers) of the Battle of Kasserine is a fascinating story and this book by mr. Blumenson adds perfectly. It gives a good account of the activities from the staff down to the common soldier, but only for the U.S. side. No personal German accounts are used and the scope of vision is never switched to this side, except for the commanders. This gives a rather impersonal ghost-like picture of these ""professional veterans"". Hence the four stars instead of five. Kasserine Pass has been a wonderful read and a thrilling experience."
5,Excellent book!,"The Myth 2 Handbook is chock full of goodies, and insightful information written by one of the most involved members of the Myth community. His clear and witty style takes you through the annals of MythII. From 3rd party editing to strategy and more, this handbook is the best resource a Myther could want."
3,Definitely Dark..,"Dark is right. The characters and the landscape are full of dreams that mock their inability to know what they want from life, let alone have the courage to strive for it. The girl is in the same mould - although more ""feral"" than the older inghabitants of the valley (portraying the reality that each generation is gettting less ""fit"" for any life). The fear of the other feral, the big cat, also drives the characters to even more callow behaviour.All the characters such pathetic creatures that their death or probable future imprisonment seems meaningless.Without one character to care about, I did not care for the book despite its powerful prose and clever swapping of narrator as the action unfolds"
1,WARNING: Product Rip-off !,"WARNING! The bridge assembly shipped is nothing like the photo. It is much cheaper in construction. The package is branded as ""Kluson"":- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT contained within the body of the steel bridge (as shown in photo), they just sit in open slots and so they pop out easily.- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT Phillips head screws (as shown in photo) but are cheap slot head screws.- the actual bridge saddles are NOT pre-grooved (as shown in photo), and grooving them yourself is a royal pain in the butt.- the holes in the bridge body for the vertical adjustment screws are NOT chamfered (as shown in photo) and so the bridge body does not ride smoothly when adjusted.Basically, the bridge assembly shipped by W D Music is total junk. It deserves a negative star rating."
3,L&M is quite a bit better,"If you have never had pure cranberry juice, then you might find the Lakewood exceptional. However, it is not nearly as good as L&M. Compared to L&M, the Lakewood tastes sort of watery and flavorless, as if Lakewood used a lower quality of cranberry in making their juice. The L&M is alot crisper and full of good cranberry flavor. The L&M color is also nice and bright red, whereas the Lakewood is considerably more brown. As far as I know, they are about the same price."
3,CD ROM is PC only and not PC/Mac,I purchased this to use the CDROM. I am a Mac user. The CDROM is made for PC only and not PC/MAC as the description state. Other than that the printed contracts are pretty good
5,best buy,"Wow, I never would of imagined that a collection like this would be so helpful around the house. I have one copy at the office where is serves me well so I thought that I should buy one for the home to continue studying these awful contracts at home, so I bought one and I found out that I could also do business from home, i would meet a client over a cup of coffee and discuss the deal while in the comfort of my own home"
3,Beware of false reviews,"Check the other reviews of most of the positive reviewers of this book - they're working for the publisher. These contracts may be useful for you, but compare them with other contracts and make sure they have everything you need. Don't just go blindly using them."
3,Only 25 contracts,"This was way too much money for a binder of simple, standard contracts. Some are helpful others are not. For example, there is a contract for parents permission for a minor or for television/radio commericals. Only get this if you really want to see a contract rider, producer and management contract(s). The record label contract is very indie so be warned. The CD-Rom in the package is the same as the binder, but allows you to go into the file and put names/dates and pretty much modify the whole contract."
4,A Sad Love Story,"As one of my favorite Korean actor, Kwon San Woo made his role perfectly! His ""best friend"", really was good and good looking, too. The leading actess did her part, but something is missing on her act. I like her aunt and the bald guy, they made the story enjoyable. I like the story."
5,Excelent Shows,"I love Hannah Montana because it is decent and wholsom entertainment. Miley also sings excelent songs. I would hope that all those who are old and young who would like to watch clean and decent shows would watch this, which should always be one's goal."
2,Hannah review,DVD had 2 Hannah episodes. I was expecting something else. I can't understand why it says Miley says goodbye-the episodes had nothing to do with that.
5,"These are great, for gals or guys, with the clear or black stones.","Beautiful afar and close up. These are great, for gals or guys, with the clear or black stones. Someone here says he/she got a defective or broken one, and instead of proactively returning it for replacement to really see and appreciate its intended beauty, they just complained and knee jerked to blankedly prejudged them all as a low one star item???? Any shape or style (Chrysler Bldg or Big Ben or Toronto Tower) could just as well be defeat upon delivery. How sad, and too bad, it was his/her own loss, because these little Eiffel Towers are much much nicer than most of the typical souvenir ones (with or w/o stones) sold as keychains, etc. even right in Paris (been there got one, still, and not complaining)."
2,"Great looking at a far, not so nice upclose","Item is very good looking in pictures but in real life it's lacking allot. The crystals are not very clear and several have fallen out and the tip already has a crack in it, I expect it to fall off withen a month or so. Save your money or find some thing else."
1,These Don't Work with Nokia,"These don't work with Nokia cell phones. After reading many reviews of other headsets, others don't seem reliable either."
1,Can't hear. Doesn't stay in ear.,The title says it all. I don't even use it and driving with a cell phone is against the law in CA.
1,Not as described!,"The product description on Amazon's web page indicates that this headset is compatible with the Nokia 2600 phone. So I ordered two of them together, but neither one worked with my Nokia 2600. Since the seller would only refund my purchase price and original shipping charges, I had to pay the return shipping costs myself. So I'm now back to square one with no headset for my phone -- and with less money in the bank than before. The only reason I'm giving this headset one star is because I wasn't able to proceed with my review unless I rated it at least one star!"
4,Works,This headset worked with my nokia 2610. Sound is fine and people said they could hear me just fine. The ear piece is a little uncomfortable to me and probably not something I'd want to use hours on end but it works.
1,"Contrary to description, does NOT work with Nokia 2600",This is listed as working with the Nokia 2600 cellphone. It does not. Buy beware!
2,Intermittent connection causes static,"This would be a great little headset, but mine has a poor connection near the phone end that makes static when the wire moves. There is also a problematic hang-up switch on the boom; it's problematic because I often press it and end the call while I'm putting the thing on my ear."
2,"""Fruits"" of Vatican II","This is a sad, but excellent book documenting how homosexuals have nearly hijacked the Catholic priesthood. They were able to do this in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, the greatest disaster in the 2,000 year old history of the Catholic Church.We have Christ's promise that the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church, but it is sure getting a beating at the hands of its Judas bishops and priests. Michael Rose does a great job of telling this story in his book. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those Catholics with their heads still in the clouds (the pay, pray, obey variety, who think the pope and the bishops can do no wrong)."
5,From a seminarian's mom,"Thank God that this book has finally been written. Scripture says that the truth will set us free. For the young men, the heterosexual/orthodox seminarians like my son(who are in the minority in some seminaries), I pray that every Catholic will read this because this book shows it like it is.... perhaps not in every seminary but in some and that is too many lost vocations. The crisis in priestly vocations in America will not abate until and unless the seminaries here are purged of the teachers sowing dissent and seminary formation staff members which crucify orthodox seminarians. Thank you Mr. Rose"
1,Paints the seminaries with one brush,I have experienced the worst and the best of seminaries. The world is not as dark as is portrayed by this book. Yes there are dark spots and something needs to be done. But the book does not strike me as balanced or thorough journalism
1,A Serious Caution,"This is an ideological work rather than a thoughtful one. We need to ask the question ""Why are our best and brightest not going into the priesthood and religious life""? Some of the seminaries that are very clerical and afraid of questions raised by the broader Catholic community draw many effeminate and immature candidates. This will just make the current problem worse."
2,Take Another Look Please,"This author doesn't explore the real issue of what the church considers valuable, instead, he stays mired in the same old sacrifical muck. He tries to explain that the liberal years of the 60's through the 80's caused much of the church's decline, but many of us life-long Catholics in the real world have a somewhat different viewpoint. Narrow minded thinking and the belief that only men can run the church, has now caught up with us. But this off-limits subject certainly isn't explored. Now with the harsh light of truth shining on the recent ugliness, perhaps men with power in the church will listen, and perhaps now they'll start to widen their outdated stance about women taking larger roles. And maybe someone will even have the courage to write a book about it! If you want to read the same old stuff on Catholicism, only with a dramatic twist, then this is your book."
1,Biased and Stupid,"This book is terribly flawed. What does Michael Rose want, a return to pre-Vatican II? The first rule of those studying for the priesthood is to be intelligent, not orthodox. Orthodoxy got us into this situation in which the the majority of Catholic Bishops are ""Yes"" men who have no brains."
5,A Must Read!,"The narrator's sense of humor had me laughing out loud from the beginning. Once I started the book, I hated to put in down! Anyone who has lived in a small town will recognize each of the characters. For a first book, Ms. Hartwick has a winner. As the characters developed their stories were not all laughs, but this group gave me inspiration to try to form my own investment group. Even though this story is fiction, it gives you the feeling that anything is possible for women who are willing to pursue their dream!"
3,"Fun, but you don't forget it is fiction....","The ladies are fun, but a little old from my perspective (I am 23). I had a little trouble relating because of this.Also, as someone else wrote, it is difficult to believe that the same people are continually in the right place at the right time. When I read fiction I like to think that the story could take place somewhere, but in this case I just couldn't imagine it.It's good if you can read fast, but if you're slower like me it drags on way too long."
4,New Friends,"I stumbled across Ladies With Options while browsing for an audio book to listen to while communting to work. This book is an absolute delight. In fact, the book is so engaging that there were times when I'd reached the office and sat in the parking garage listening rather than interupt a point in the story! When the book was finished I felt like I was missing old friends. Can't wait to see the movie version and eagerly await Ladies With Prospects."
4,Funny and Engaging,"I enjoyed this book very much. Many of the female characters were quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) tough, smart, big-hearted women. It is a fast paced and easy read, with many laugh out loud moments. This is a great book to take to the beach, or sit on the patio and wile away an afternoon. While many characters were one dimensional and predictable, this is somehow comforting in a beach read. You don't have to stay up nights trying to figure out what might come next."
5,The Ladies deliver!,"Ladies with options is a hoot. Hartwick has created a delightful group of women, each with her own particular foibles, but who, together, make a team that accomplishes miracles. Set in a fictional small town in Minnesota,life in the Upper Midwest is described by the narrator who provides a wry, urban perspective while revealing that she, too, has her needs and dreams. Rest assured, everything works out in the end in a most satisfying fashion, but on the way we are treated to ups and downs ranging from the merely comic to the hilarious. Hartwick also peppers the narrative with a menagerie of witticisms, including a few puns that are real groaners. Suffice it to say that the book carries you from page to page, from chapter to chapter and delivers the goods all the way to the end. We want more from Cynthia!"
3,Cute and Enjoyable,"A quick read. A feel good book. A great book to read on vacation. I love the parts about one of the ladies opening a hair salon. If you have ever been in the ""hair"" business, you will find this part of the book really entertaining."
3,"Very light reading, I was skimming by the end","I started out liking this book. But it wore thin towards the end. The chapters are short, a page and a half, and each is some event, that is resolved there and never mentioned again. Such topics as unemployment, homosexuality and domestic abuse are give a few paragraphs. I also felt that the author made the Metodist Ladies act in ways that it hasn't been my exerience that religious people would behave, especially older women."
4,Graco Stroller Starter Kit,"Never did get around to using it. But, it had everything I would've used if I actually liked venturing out in nasty weather..."
3,No access to product service department,"The dvd player performed very well, but when I accessed the menu to make a minor alteration I completely lost the picture. My efforts to contact the Toshiba technical servic dpt. for help were unsuccessful. Toshiba US told me that they knew nothing of this particular product. Amazon.com told me to get in touch with Toshiba, and did not react to my response that Toshiba knew nothing about this product. I finally fixed the problem myself. Amazon should have provided the manufacturer's identity, presumably a Toshiba company outside the US, and how to get in touch with product technical service personnel."
2,Did not play our UK DVD's,"We tried to go through all the set up menus, but no luck. It would play US DVD's but not European DVD's. The sellers were very cooperative in the return and credit. We purchased the Phillips and it worked right away."
1,Wack,"This is an example of how rap is getting worse and worse nowadays. remember the days when rap was good? There gone and that is a shame, cause of biatchs like the game and 50.The beats are annoying and generic, produced by Dre who needs to get back to bein' better at producin'. The lyrics here are weak with no talent, especially 50 who makes this worser than it is already. Also the flow on here is weak and the whole track is basically.I don't understand why this type of rap is gettin' fame and respect while all the talented rappers are unknown by most people for some reasonwhich i'll never know.(...)"
4,Dead Kennedys Rule Forever,"O.K. i just got this DVD today and i haven't had the time to watch it that much, only a couple of songs and i have to say it is a great DVD. As other reviewers say, the quality is not that good, hence the 4 stars, but it's a great way to see Dead Kennedys at their best. The video isn't that good and during the songs sometimes the mic goes off, but those were the good times, when nothing was perfect, and punk was about making a statement, not selling a million albums."
5,DMPO's on broadway,"This is the original Dead Kennedys in their prime and it proves that they were an excellent live band. (and probably still are) many fans steer away from this because of the set list, but don't be scared; live the band pumps new life into ""jock o rama"" ""goons of hazard"" ""do the slag"" and ""hop with the jet set"" The sound isn't perfect but for a live punk show it's above par. the camera work is excellent. The crowd is energized, jumping all over the place but they don't seem to care much for Jello's in between song political rants. ""Moral majority"" slows the show a bit ""goons of hazard"" and ""bleed for me"" steals the show. Whatever reputation Dirk Dirkson has doesn't appear to cool here, at the end of the show instead of thanking the fans for their support he insults them. Overall this is a great DK and La punk document despite the track list and the sound."
3,Only if you love your Jello,"Pretty crummy quality, but we're talking about a 20 year old film shot in a punk rock club so what do you expect?If you're a big DKs fan, you'll enjoy this chance to see Jello's wacky antics, and it's interesting to see the mid-80s punk crowd. If you're not a big fan, you'll probably think this sucks."
3,Turn off those microwave lights!!,"Considering this was filmed in 1984 in a live wild punk rock set the film is well done. The stage lighting was awful. The sound was ok, drums sound just made the cut and Jello's voice while performing was cut, no heard, muffed...a typical show. A must for fans. Not the best set, but classic Jello. Do recommend but don't expect quality DVD, do expect DK on DVD. Ah, the stereo sound also did it good. Not the video, they had four camera persons filming at the same time, I do not feel that this was NOT taken advantage of. Ah, Punk rock how you now elude me... poor sod."
3,Luckily no longer considered continuity,"Ultimately, this is a decent story. It does contain elements that I strongly feel should not be part of Superman lore. Having Clark Kent know Lex Luthor when they were young is absolutely absurd. It's simply bad storytelling.This story borrows far too heavily from the hack show Smallville, one of the worst and grossly overrated adaptions of the young Clark Kent mythos to date.This starts off an interesting, even an excellent read, becomes ridiculous, and ends in an entertaining way. DC removing this from continuity was a smart idea."
5,"It will always be the ""real"" origin to me...","This is my personal favorite Superman tale (yes, even over ""Red Son"" or ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tommorrow?"", though on equal footing with ""All-Star Superman"") and my preferred version of his 21st-century origin story. I sorely wish that this book had remained in canon, because THIS is the book that tells readers who Superman really is as a superhero and as a man. Mark Waid & Leinil Yu managed to craft a new and compelling take on the character while still staying true to his core traits. A terrible missed opportunity for DC! Forget the New 52 and the ""Earth One"" garbage.Alas, this will probably never happen, but I still wonder if the publisher will see the error of its ways and restore Waid's continuity. Perhaps in a nice one-shot? A man can dream..."
4,Very good book!,I'd rate it 5 stars but it is a bit pricey. But then again I didn't spend my money on comic books growing up. My daughter needed it for one of her classes in college and loved the book!
1,BYRNE WAS BETTER... R.I.P. SUPERMAN (1986-1993),"The best Superman books were from a 7 year period (1986-1993). John Byrne, Marv Wolfman, Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern and a host of creators defined Superman for a generation. SUPERMAN BIRTHRIGHT is a terrible origin and a lackluster story. If you read it, ignore it. Or don't read it at all."
5,"If they make a new Superman movie, they should use this story","If you have ever felt that Superman has become an icon rather than a character, this story is a breath of fresh air. You actually get to see Clark Kent as a person, a fallible person, and how he constructs both the ""Clark"" and ""Superman"" personas. It also deals with the secondary characters intelligently. The Kents are real people with thoughts, feelings, and flaws rather than just paragons of American parenting. The reporters in the Daily Planet bullpen are well done as well, especially Lois. All in all, if you are a die hard Supes fan, or have never been able to connect with him as a character, this is worth a read."
3,"Good, but not great","It could have been better. It's not as good as John Byrne reinterpratation 20 years ago,Superman: The Man of Steel, Vol. 1, which I consider superior to this one."
5,Love it.,"While I do prefer Superman: Secret Origin as the definitive Superman Origin, this is a close second. I liked how the relationship between Lex and Superman was definitively explored and how it showed that even as a young boy, Lex was destined for villainy. The story moves along well and the characters are very memorable. The one thing that I feel was a big drawback was the art. I am not a fan of Francis Yu's art style. But even still, I liked the story so much that I didn't even care. This is a good Superman story and I fully recommend it."
1,Futile Frying Pan,"Bought this pan hoping it would live up to its description. It didn't! The steel is quite thin. No matter what I cook in it, using moderate amounts of oil, the food sticks and clean up is impossible. I have other stainless steel pans which work beautifully - conduct heat well, food doesn't stick and clean up is a breeze, (no they're not All-Clad and I didn't pay a fortune). Although I've had T-Fal products which are quite good - this is definitely not one of them. Do not buy this pot!"
3,Finicky for a Stainless Skillet,"Although I think this is a very sturdy pan, I have to agree with the first two reviewers that it has a ""sticking"" problem. It makes no sense to me, I thought stainless steel is stainless steel.The only solution I have found is that it must be seasoned before using. I do this by by coating the inside with oil, and heating it at a low temperature (just below the smoking point of the oil) for about half an hour. Then, it becomes a nice fry pan.Or, if you use it daily, wipe yesterday's oil out with a paper towel and rinse under the tap, then heat it, and then the cooking surface is much friendlier than if you had scoured it.This sticking problem makes it as finicky as a cast iron skillet, but it is friendly if you treat it right."
4,"Kansas - Device, Voice, Drum","Outstanding song selection and performance. The return of violinist, Robby Steinhart is invaluable as he lends sturdy lead and back-up vocal support and an amazing energy to the show.Incidentally, Steve Walsh has regained much of his vocal range that was missing in the band's 1990's performances and his vocals on ""Dust in the Wind"" has never sounded better.The inspired performance is vintage Kansas at their best!"
5,Don't listen to the nay-sayers!,"I've started collecting music DVDs lately and this is the best yet. If you are any type of Kansas fan, you have to have this DVD. Yes, Walsh's voice is not as strong as it once was and the vocal arrangements in some parts are slightly different because of it, but they play almost every note perfectly. The drumming rivals Peart and everyone else is right on the money.Any slight hint of graininess came from low lighting and being shot on film. But you really have to look for it and it is a nit-picky issue. And there is fog used on stage which might make it appear as though you are watching it through ""smoke"" as one review put it.If you like Kansas, get it, don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great CD been wanting to see this again for a while.,"Great CD been wanting to see this again for a while. I am glad Robby Steinert was on this CD. I just saw then at the Borgata , they were really good but unfortunatley they are showing their age. Still enjoyed the shoew though, I wish I had seen them in terir prime."
5,Kansas DVD Rocks!,"This DVD is a MUST for any Kansas fan. It was well produced. The music was great, and the extra bonus features were very insightful. GET IT!"
3,Reason #1 why I dislike DVDs-,"What's up with the crowd in the background- were they paid? Subpar performances....feels strained and forced...screetchy, scratchy vocals from Walsh...tired of hearing standard issue Kansas songs...Hey, I love this band but I've seen them live 4 times and they were so much better. The whole package seems too sanitized. Sorry Folks."
4,A great addition to any music lovers DVD collection,"While the lighting makes for some muddy/blurry visual moments it doesn't erase the spectacular performance by the band. If you're a casual Kansas fan (Dust, Wayward Son) you will be enlightened by the brilliant musicianship and complex arrangements delivered with a live intensity and a studio quality tightness. Steve Walsh has lost some of his high end wail, but he has adapted well utilizing different notes and placement. The extras are great. Buy it."
4,A very good show and songs,"After seeing some of the videos in Youtube I decided to buy the DVD, just so I could enjoy the show in one sitting instead of watching individual videos. I am a Kansas fan and never saw them live, so this was as good a reason to get it. The band is tight in all the songs, vocal harmonies are right on the mark. Each member doesn't outshine the others and it seems that they enjoy the performance.Robbie is great on the violin and as a frontman, his faraway look while singing Cheyenne Anthem is haunting. While his voice has thickened over the years, he still delivers. Steve sounds much better than the Whiskey, and his passion never wavers, while playing keyboard parts that were done by two; very professional and what a musician.Five played what used to be done by six and any musician will tell you that to cover the parts well is very hard work. They did it and I'm glad for this DVD. My next purchase will be There's Know Place Like Home:)"
2,Disappointing purchase,"Based on all the 5 star reviews of this DVD, I really was looking forward to a terrific concert. Unfortunately, while the 5.1 audio is superb, this DVD is ruined by very grainy picture quality. As a benchmark, I use 'House of Yes' and the Eagle's ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVDs, which on my 56"" HDTV are stunningly clear. As a test I tried the Kansas DVD on my smaller tube TV and it was just as bad there. Steer clear of this one unless you are not bothered by the picture quality."
3,"are you crazy, this is not Kansas","Kansas WAS the guitarist / songwriter Kerry Livgren and Kansas was the Lynn Meredith. I purchased this DVD hoping to hear KANSAS and instead I feel duped. I watched and saw a concert that looks like a cheesy Kansas ripoff. Kerry Livgren is nowhere to be seen, neither is the voice of Lynn Meredith to be heard on the hits like ""Dust In The Wind."" This is a short review, yes, but don't listen to the others who say this is a great Kansas concert DVD. Come on, 4 1/2 stars? What was and what shall never be again is the original Kansas. Anyone want to buy this DVD please email me."
3,kansas DVD review,"Good sound, nice songs selection, bad image. What's with Steve Walsh clothes , those pants and belt are best suited for any grandfather over 65."
2,Disappointing,"This DVD had the worst picture of any concert DVDs I own. By design, everything has a hazy, grainy look. It's like sitting at the top of an arena looking through the smoke at the stage.Save your money and do not buy this DVD."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Way too many jams,too many songs missing from this dvd, and felt very disappointed after watching the show. I own over 50 concerts on dvd and this was the worst one I have ever purchased. I tried watching again after a year had passed, just to see if my opinion had changed, but it still is a horrible concert. I enjoy the music of Kansas, so I think that's why I ended up being so disappointed in this show."
1,This is the worst DVD I Ever bought,"This DVD is an embarrassment!Their music sounds like a cross between a kitchy Mannheim Steamroller on steriods and an ultra-Elizabethan Pentangle on acid. Verbose with overblown baroque sensibilities, they've become caricatures of what they once were.The lead singer, Steve Walsh, has lost his voice, screeches to hit high notes and becomes more irritatingly annoying as the concert progresses. Even 'Dust in the Wind', their signature tune, becomes too painful to enjoy.I bought two copies of this DVD because I was planning to give one copy as a gift. That won't happen now. (Does that mean I'll have to watch this trifle twice? I hope not. . .)I won't even talk about Robby Steinhardt's 'Hagrid' look.Save your money."
4,Kansas 25 years later LIVE,"Rec'd product rather quickly in perfect shape, wrapped and packed as new. Audio and video play clear and sharp. Good product. Good vendor."
1,disgusting propaganda,"This 'book' is one of the most disgusting examples of WWII concentration camp revisionism. It tries to downplay the number of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies murdered by WWII Croatian Ustasha government at the Jasenovac concentration camp.This is part of the most sickening propaganda produced by the Croatian Information Ministry during the Tudjman years in an attempt to clean up the history of Croatia."
4,All In All Worth The Rent...Buying though? u decide...,"Everyone complains that this movie is unoriginal, it's not supposed to be original, it's a remake! It is a good movie though especially if you like the acting talent they got for it, The actors do indeed make this film worth while! If you're not looking for a ground-breaking innovative movie and like the good old police corruption, shoot'em up, conspiracy movies then this is it. All in all it is worth renting, decide on buying it after that."
2,Not that great,"While Claire Danes is stunning in this slow, boring action flick, I found the film to be less than entertaining. The premise for ""The Mod Squad"" is excellent, and could have been just great, but the plot falls short of anything expected by the viewer. Although this movie is definitely not worth buying, it's a good choice for video rental."
1,"Loud, Bright, High Action! And Borrrrring","Amazing how so much action, noise, pulsing rock music and lively young actors can add up to such a dull movie. I rated it one star because Amazon won't allow Zero stars. This one is unwatchable, literally. Not even laughable so you can't sit there and mock it. It is just boring and dull. Rent anything else at all - you're sure to like it better."
1,Negative Stars Apply,"First of all, Peggy Lipton's Julie would have whipped Claire Danes' Julie two times over and thrice on Sunday. How such a cool TV show could go bad as a movie boggles the mind. Ribisi's a great actor, but he's totally miscast at Pete. Same goes for Omar - not the Linc I had in mind AT ALL!!Seriously, those of us who actually paid money to see this dribble weren't going in for Masterpiece Theatre. What we got was the thrill of telling everyone we know that we paid to see one of the worst films of all time. Yippee."
1,The Blah Squad,"What a dreary exercise this is! When Hollywood adapts TV shows to the big screen it would help to have a decent script. It's flicks like this that tanked M-G-M as a viable studio. The basic story comes from a cookie cutter involving corrupt cops, a prostitution ring, and stolen drugs from the police evidence room. There's more originality in a typical episode of ""T.J. Hooker"". The three young leads(Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi) do their best to breathe life in this inert dreck to little avail. Dennis Farina as Captain Greer does himself a favor by dying early and not having to suffer the grind of being in the majority of this swill. Avoid this one at all costs. Noteworthy, if anybody cares, Dey Young who played Kate Rambeau in the cult classic ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" appears briefly as Ribisi's mother."
1,The Dream Team,"(This film might put you to sleep.)Genre classifications ""action"" and ""thriller"" are both terribly misapplied in this case. The film's pacing is slow, the character development doesn't really exist with regard to some important characters, the writing is poor, and as such it is difficult to judge whether the acting is subpar because the actors aren't all that great (though Ribisi has proven his ability in some much better stuff) or because the script wasn't worth producing. Add to all of this a sad lack of special effects and an unmemorable soundtrack, and you've got an entire work of below-average film making.If you're looking for an arcane suspense/action, ""Ronin"" might be a good pick, but even still, for blockbuster quality stick to the well-traveled paths of smash hits. There's a reason ""everybody"" liked some films.ALong"
1,A disgrace in the careers of the three youg actors,"This is a horrible film. I bought it because it had Claire Danes in it.... and the other two lead actors aren't quite that bad. But it just hurts to see them suffering to salvage this fractured nonsense of a script.The story is that these 3 Juvenile delinquents get a second chance by serving as a pawn of the police. One was a club DJ, who stutters, One was a gangsta, and claire danes was... some prostitute or something? Whatever. And they go against this huge drud deal or something that involves the police, that tries to get away by putting all the blame on the trio.But the three, never really does anything, things hardly develop, the DJ does absolutely nothing, the editing is really 3rd rate, and... Ah, I really don't want to remember it.Amazon.com had the nerve to recommend this thing to me, probably because I looked up other stuff that stars Claire Danes. Well, maybe your recommendation system needs a bit more tweaking..."
4,Fun Movie,"I was very suprised to see so many negative reviews on this movie! I only bought it because I love Claire Danes but was pleasantly suprised by it. All the acting was great, the story was interesting, what more are you people looking for? Given, I never saw the show but I enjoyed this movie and have watched it twice and it will stay a part of my collection for a long time to come."
1,"Bad plot, uninteresting movie","The mod squad gets started 'after' the formation of the ""Mod Squad"" without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doing.Moreover, most of the events in the movie seem ancillary to the plot. Without even a smack of character development, the plot meanders from Gen-X club scenes to action scenes and back again."
1,Embarrasing.,"For those who don't know, the premise of the TV show was that these three troubled kids had some attitude but were actually decent, sympathetic characters. And they had as their ""father figure"", Captain Greer.Just copy that formula, with Clarie Danes--who IS cute--and bingo, instant hit.But no. First we kill off the guy who's supposed to watch over them. Next, we make them unsympathetic slackers. Finally, add a dash of silly, dated dialog like ""Solid, man"". (Which sounded ridiculous, even in the 60s, trust me).I don't know who Giovanni is but he should get some sleep and try breathing through his nose so he can close his mouth occasionally. Even when he isn't talking his mouth is open.Didn't they give any thought to the lack of chemistry between these actors--and how unappealing they are in these roles? I'd send them back to prison."
1,"This review is helpful, it can save you 1hr30mins of life!!!",I can't believe this is from the screenwriter who brought us 8 MILE. The only reason this gets one star is because Claire Danes runs around in her underwear a lot and Giovanni Ribisis is entertaining as always and does what he can with what little he has to work with.Instead of a review I'll give you a warning. This will be the most regretful hour and a half you'll spend watching a movie in your entire life. It's not as bad as THE MUSKETEER and the first TOMB RAIDER movie but it's up there.F+ (the plus is for Claire Daines who deserves better)
2,disappointed,"I got this item this past week and have used it 3 times. It looks beautiful right out of the packaging but the looks don't hold up. The lustre turned lack lustre after the first washing. After the 3rd washing the inside of the pan looks like I've had it at least a year, there are lines and discoloration. I followed manufacturers recommedations and cooked over a low heat and seasoned before the first use. It does heat quickly in that respect I would give it 5 stars. It's listed as 10.25 inches but is actually 10.5 inches."
2,Less than advertised,"Forty years ago, I purchased a paperback copy of Screwtape Letters and a copy of Screwtape Proposes a Toast by C.S.Lewis. This year, I saw the hardcover version of Screwtape Letters offered by Amazon, and the description said ""with Screwtape Proposes a Toast."" Well, I guess the old addage: ""let the buyer beware"" holds true. When my copy arrived, it only had the first chapter of Screwtape Proposes a Toast. WATCH OUT for that ""come-on."" This book is incomplete: it's missing about 100 pages of text! So, it's my fault for not being more careful, but it's also the seller's fault for not being accurate in the description."
5,great resource,Book arrived earlier than expected. It was in very good condition with a good price. Definitely a keeper for every complete Cristin library
5,Excellent!,"An must-read for all Christians, new and old alike. I have been truly enlightened by Screwtape describing his means and methods for trying to get Christians to 'come to the other side.' If you ever thought the devil was tempting you, you were probably right. You'll also learn that miscellaneous negative thoughts that come to you are not random, but carefully placed by the likes of Screwtape or one of his talented co-workers.Reading this book will allow you to see things in a new light, and further strengthen your faith. It's a great weapon in the war of good vs. evil."
5,Modern masterpiece,"C.S. Lewis triumphs again in one of his many insightful writings. The Screwtape Letters is as inspired a work as Bunyan's Pilgrims Progress. The book is written on an eerily accurate level, even amongst skeptics. The work details the how and why behind that feeling - how sometimes we ""just know"" that there are forces out there that influence behaviour. The subject of demonic interventionists is one that not many can make a convincing case for in this day and age, but Lewis does so in an artistic and articulate way-not soon to be forgotten. Lewis falls in a category of literary genius from Aristotle to Shakespeare, to Dickens. I wish we could have had him longer."
5,Enlightening read for committed (and thinking) Christians,"I don't know how well this great book translates to agnostic readers, but for me it was a very enlightening and concrete way to understand what it means to try to be a good man in a world of temptation.In keeping with the time period, I believe it was Winston Churchill who said ""All evil needs to triumph is for good men to do nothing"". In the Screwtape Letters the senior tempter, tells his apprentice, it is just as affective to get a man to stare into a fire until it turns to ash, as to get him to commit some great sin, because either keeps him from doing what he should. I wonder what Mr. Lewis would have thought of digital cable television? I am as guilty as anyone of staring at that box instead of doing good.So here's the deal.This is an excellent book for any believer from High School on up, that wants to be good and avoid evil.But that's just me."
5,Amazing wake-up to all who think they know Satan,"I am a Christian, and was absolutely awestruck by this tour-de-force Christian book. It is absolutely AMAZING how subtle the enemy is, and this book does a exemplary job of showing us just who the enemy REALLY is. ""He is a liar and the father of lies"" (John 8:44), and cannot speak a word of truth, and this book really highlights this fact. I encourage ALL Christians to read this book to remind you what you are REALLY up against."
5,ITS A MASTERPIECE,This is my second reading of the book - about 15 years since my first reading. It was powerful then and is more powerful now in regards to the subliminal manipulation by evil. I appreciate Mr. Lewis taking the time and energy to share his knowledge and spiritual strength. I can not imagine anyone reading this book and not being changed for the better. I recommend it to everyone I know.
5,Screwtape Letters,"This book is amazing! It is a fun read and a great piece of literature. C.S. Lewis is a genius. I first picked out this book because it is a satire and because I like the cover back when I was in 7th grade. I loved the book so much then.Now that I am an undergraduate in English Literature, I still love it and think this is the best book I have ever read. I have read many books and have not found anything close to greatness as this book is.I highly recommend this book to everyone of all ages. It is easy to read and has a great story. You don't need to be a Christian to read this book but it will definitely make you think by the end of it.Read it, you won't be sorry."
3,The demon haunted world of CS Lewis,"The Screwtape Letters is a clever imagined dialogue between a senior demon and his nephew (also a demon). The demons are trying to tempt an English man away from God (who they refer to as `The Enemy'). Athough Lewis often falls prey to excessive pomp and wordiness, the book is witty and well organized. The letter format makes for easy reading.As an atheist, my enjoyment of this book really hinges on how literally I choose to read it. On the one hand, I find the theme of this life as a divine God-sanctioned test complete with demonic supernatural opponents as unfounded, superstitious, and resultant in unnecessary fear and stress. If I instead choose to read the book metaphorically, Lewis makes some brilliant observations about human vices and virtue (and how the latter too often lead to the former) amongst the religious clutter.If you're going to be a Christian, you could certainly do far worse than the Christianity of CS Lewis."
5,awesome,the person that sold me this book was a pleasure to buy from. They were able to change the address at the last moment. This book is great. Its a good read that helps Christians stay on their toes with their enemy the devil.
5,A guide to the supernatural,Although I have never read the book myself my Dad has read it many times and constantly refers to it in conversation. His comments from it have made a considerable impact on me and it is in the pile of books which I have to read
1,only for the religious,I was very dissappointed when I read (part of) this book. It's really a religious tract and is only interesting for the very religious people. Everyone else will find it super-dull. It's a long series of discussions on various aspects of religious thought thinly disguised as amusing chatter from a daemon. The characterisation and story don't amount to much and are only there to back up the proselytising message.
5,The Screwtape Letters,"I have heard references to the book for decades, but this was the first opportunity to read and study the material - with the associated guidebook. It was a great experience."
2,"Looks fantastic on the web, in person not so amazing.","Photograph of the item is stunning however; upon opening the package the actual item looks extremely small. I have a hard time believing the before discount price is correct. The included gift box is small, and feels cheap. If I could have seen this item in store before purchase I would have passed."
1,Not for learning Thai,"I have to say if I were Thai and wanted to learn english, or use it to speak english for me, this and other models will do. But this does not work both ways, it only speaks english and translates to english. If you try to take thai script to english you will end up with nonsense, and a few laughes. It is a shame with the tech available that they missed out on making a great product. I have a talking english spanish translator from franklin that is simple to use and useful. I can only hope they will learn from their mistakes."
3,Great for Thai wanting to learn English,"As the others said, unless you can read Thai, this is not for you."
4,witness to a lost landscape,"Thesiger's account of his visits to the marshlands in the 1950s and early 1960s, though perhaps not as well written as his crossing of the empty quarter or Gavin Maxwell's own account of the Iraqi marshlands, still remains a classic of modern exploration literature. His presage about what would soon happen to the marshes and their inhabitants is haunting, for as Nik Wheeler (photographer in Gavin Young's ""Return to the Marshes"") recently wrote in my ""Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq"": ""Wilfred Thesiger was unfortunately quite prescient when he wrote in the mid-sixties that 'Recent political upheavals in Iraq have closed this area to visitors. Soon the Marshes will probably be drained; when this happens, a way of life that has lasted for thousands of years will disappear.'"" And tragically, it has."
4,Thank you! Bigfoot will be here all week!,"If you are looking for a DVD with credible eye witness acounts of the monster, serious investigations in the hunt for Bigfoot and to expand your knowledge about the elusive creature, then this is NOT the DVD for you. Take a trip down the lighter side in the hunt for the Squatch. You will see the Darrel Owens video of a light coloured bigfoot which is less funny than the rest of the show. A ""unique"" perspective on the Bigfoot phenomena. A good comedic jouney in the ""Hunt""? for Sasquatch."
4,Squatching,The first video is actually worth watching. Interesting to see the difference between the two videos. The first video he is mocking the BF phenomenon. The second he is actually changed after having an encounter.
4,Good but...,"This bag is good, but my dog don't like a dark inside.In my opinion inside must be white or a light color"
2,Not recommended -- ignores basic safety issues,"This book is filled with pretty pictures of seniors doing easy to difficult postures. No attempt is made to discuss the precautions anyone, but especially older people should take in practicing yoga, and I would definately not recommend it for an older beginner, especially anyone with injuries. A far better book is The New Yoga for People Over 50, Suza Francina, which discusses the changes that take place as we age, and shows many asanas with appropriate use of props and modifizations for safety, and which are suitable/unsuitable for injuries, high blood pressure -- a much, much better book."
4,Excellent Starter for Beginners of any Age,"I started using this book at age 41, and found it is extremely practical & provides easy to follow directions. The recommended programs at the back give guidance that other books don't. I have mild sciatica now rather than the crippling back pain I suffered from 2 years ago, before following the programs in this book."
4,Yoga Over 50 Book,"Good book. I've done yoga before, so I was familiar with poses. If you haven't done yoga before, this may be hard for a first-timer."
3,Yoga for Seniors,"As the baby boomers age group becomes a significant portion of the population, it is necessary to inspire more people to keeping the body and the mind healthy and active. Whilst the models in this book are for the most part very adept in their asana practice, some of the asanas translate very well for the over 50 year old that has not had much exposure to yoga. The triangle is a nice example of this and the standing twist with one foot on the chair.I think the book is an inspiration for student who is open minded. Many of my senior students laughed when I showed them some of the poses in the book saying ""I can't do that"". Yet in that same class they did do some of the asanas,and with integrity too.This was a great psychological boost for them. We are never too old to learn new things, only too old in the habits we have cultivated. An added bonus was seeing British actor Terence Stamp in some of the photos. Camella Nair - Author of ""Aqua Kriya Yoga""."
3,Yoga over 50,Very good book if already doing yoga. It would have been nice if it had mentioned that. I have never done yoga so don't know if it is going to help or not. I will give it a try if my 60+ body can get to moving.
1,Don't waste your money here!,"Even though it's said to be compatible with Mitsubishi's original heater core part#, it's actually half the size or less; worse yet, you can't connect to the original pipes!Seems like someone typed wrong part numbers or intentionally made it under bad faith..."
4,Old Fashioned Sincerity,"This is not the best recording of Messiah but it is by no means a disaster. Susskind was an able conductor with a valid view of this great piece. The recording from the 1950s is more than adequate (there is some roughness in the treble but it is full and clear - though some edits are very obvious indeed). The orchestra is excellent and the choir sing well. The soloists - all of them - are superb, among the very best in any version of Messiah! Susskind's tempos are slow by modern standards but there is good rhythmical bounce and a genuine sense of the greatness of the piece. If you can adjust to the broad tempos and the big scale conception then you will discover important aspects of this masterpiece in this performance - and the set costs next to nothing!"
4,Worth the Price,"I'm not a music expert, and I've read (and heard) more than one complaint from music aficionados about the recording quality. My suggestion is that if you're looking for an in-depth, powerful recording to search elsewhere. However, if you just want to be able to enjoy Handel at his finest, this is the purchase for you. You just can't beat the price."
2,Pete's Dad,"I have had a CD of the London Philharmonic version of the Messiah conducted by Fredrick Jackson for several years and enjoyed listening to it. However, the quality of the recording leaves something to be desired."
1,One of the worst recordings ever made,"This is only my second one star review. And I am rather generous with stars. But this recording is just horrible, especially considering that all of the participants are legendary musicians. First of all, this is extremely old fashioned Handel. The textures are way too heavy for music of the baroque. But worst of all, the performance just sits there like mud on your tires that won't come off. Yes, the price is very low, but whatever you do, do not buy this recording."
1,Too much Xanax,"this is the worst recording of the messiah i have ever heard! it is about 33% slower in tempo; it is as if the conductor and all the players/performers took a handful of Xanax before the concert. Ugh! good think it was only a few bucks. i do not like the singers interpretation either, especially the tenor; stab me in the ears/kill me in the head! he sings good, though, but i still do not like it."
1,really not helpful,"Always leery of book authors (trying to SELL books) on the topic of frugality...this book is in the bottom of the heap, at least in my opinion.First way to be frugal is to not buy books like these and spend the time it'd take reading it doing your own research (into topics that are near and dear to you in terms of saving money or topics that you don't know enough about) at the library and/or online.In short, I felt the time spent reading this book would have been better spent doing internet and library research (on such obvious $-saving topics as mentioned in the book) on my own.Using the library is my #1 frugality tip! Sorry Amazon, I love you for many other purchasing choices...but rarely for new books."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I ordered this at the same time that I ordered ""Miserly Moms"" and this was the first one I received. I think MM will be more useful for my purposes. The first two chapters had a couple of recipes and web-sites that I may use, but it focused mainly on bigger ticket items such as vacations, furniture and computer repair that I did not really find useful. If you're looking for tips on how to save money on everyday living, this probably isn't the book for you."
1,review,I was very disappointed by this book. In the gift suggestion section many of the gifts suggested giving things that you needed the recipes from one of her other books. It was disappointing not to have access to all of the information referenced in the book. I also think much of the information was fairly common knowledge. I would not recommend this book.
3,Wasn't terribly impressed,"I had heard so much in praise of Jonni McCoy's books, and bought this one first. Really wasn't too impressed. Have Miserly Mom's on order, and hope it is better."
2,Not impressed,"Use the first book so much that I bought this one on that strength alone. Wish I hadn't! What little good info in the book is merely a rehash of the first one. Appears to me that she's trying to stretch her ""Miserly Mom"" ways by pushing off an empty sequel."
2,"it was boring, her first book was much better","I was really disappointed with this one-her first book is so much better. I found it really boring and just not that much useful info. Save your money and check it out at the library first if you think you may want it. Wish I had. But, Miserly Moms is definitely worth the money, I use it all the time."
2,No good tips here,"I purchased ""Frugal Families"" because I am already a stay-at-home mom and already have a large family, thus I skipped ""Miserly Mom."" Based on McCoy's references to ""Miserly Mom"" in this book, I bought the wrong book. I expected some tips on saving money everyday and instead got tips for decorating for the holidays, buying a car, purchasing insurance and electrical appliances. Not what I thouht I was getting and practically useless to me."
2,I didn't enjoy reading Frugal Families.,"I love Jonni McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms! It has so much information and recipes that I have read it several times! And give copies of it as gifts. This book, Frugal Families, was boring. I won't be reading this one again. Not enough interesting information."
1,not much original content,"The first thing I noticed when I got this book was the Oracle Application Server (OAS) chapters. The next thing was that the content was pulled almost word-for-word from the OAS documentation. I'm not that familiar with the other products covered in this book, but if this is how the rest of the book was written, save your money. If you have the products, you already have this book. It's just not all in one place. For example, compare the discussion of ""Multiple Instances and Threads in Cartridges"" on p. 142 of this book with p. 2-17 the OAS 4.0.7 Introduction to Applications book. Not only are the figures identical, but the text is almost a perfect match."
5,The Best of The Best,I've started to read this book and as always with TUSC you can't go wrong. For the best on Oracle Web Development this one is a must...
3,"Great start, but lacks Java/EJB description","I honestly expected much more when buying this book. After all, Oracle's promoting Java as a language of choice.After half an hour of reading, I had an impression of ""yet another PL/SQL book"".Do not get me wrong. It covers most technologies built into Oracle Application Server (by the way, the name of the book is ""Oracle 8i web development"", not ""OAS web development""), and does it in details.However, the author(s) practically altogether miss the concept of EJB, the most valuable part of Oracle 8i/OAS. There are better technologies to do server side scripting than Java servlets. OAS cartridges aren't the best solution in most of the cases either. EJB is the technology that makes many shops install Oracle8i/OAS, and it is _not_ described properly in the book."
5,Fun for kids and parents,"I bought this DVD because my 2 year old LOVES Bindi's TV shows on Discovery Kids. We are very selective about what she's allowed to watch on TV, and she became hooked on Bindi very quickly. My only complaint about the TV show was that there wasn't enough dancing, as my daughter loved the dancing the most. Bindi Kid Fitness is wonderful because the video is mostly comprised of the music/dancing portions of her TV shows. There are also some silly bits on exercise and cooking with her late dad. This DVD was a must in our family, and I think that most toddlers to preschoolers would really enjoy it."
4,"Has Flaws,But Worth the Money","The Mad Catz Team controller is an interesting one,it is exciting to be playing your new copy of madden or the games you like with a logo of your favorite team in front of you,But it comes at a price.The Analog sticks are a bit oversensitive on some games but most games can be adjusted to compensate for that,The controller is a perfect size and the select and start buttons are placed on the top instead of on the face which makes them much harder to hit my accident."
2,not what i expected!,"This is not what I expected .. The package came some what damaged a waste of money, cant return it bc of orginal package came ruined"
5,A Magical Book for Kids of All Ages!,"I love this book! By using Stevenson's poem, Ashley Wolff captures the magical moments of childhood in a way that will bring a rush of memories to adults, and instant recognition to children. Staying in bed with the flu or a cold, most children devise imaginary games to occupy their time. Future quiltmakers, carpenters and other folks, will recognize themselves in this book. A delightful romp!"
5,Very very good!,"Love Micarelli's sensuous and versatile style on this most-beguiling instrument. Every selection tells a story...if you just close your eyes and listen. Micarelli is in auspicious company these days with Josh Groban and piano virtuoso William Joseph. Encore, Ms Micarelli, encore!"
2,"Good music, but not the advertized music","I bought this CD after hearing Lucia Micarelli's incredibly compelling version of ""To Love You More"". You can hear the song at her website, luciamicarelli.com. However, the snippet of music above called ""To Love You More"" is *not* that song, and sadly it's what got stuck on the CD."
1,Lori,"If you are looking for great classical style violin playing, try Gilles Apap or Regina Carter's Paganini: After a Dream. Needless to say, Joshua Bell has some fine approachable cds also. This cd was not worth the price. Micarelli is technically okay, but this cd is boring and her playing is nothing special."
2,Not my kind of music.,"I read about this CD on the Jethro Tull web site and, contrary to what I would normally do, bought the CD on the spur of the moment. I am sure Micarelli's style might appeal to a lot of people, but I have to say I was disappointed (all due respects to you Mr. Anderson). I look forward to complex, intensely played music and don't shy away from soft relaxing music either as long as it continues to stimulate my mind. Micarelli couldn't fit into either of the categories. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic I think Lucia is trying to sell this album with her pretty face on the front and back covers."
5,relaxation,This CD is very well done. I was familiar with old favorites and delighted with new songs. I would like to hear more of the rock songs preformed by her. I think she's got a lot of talent and could possibly do well with the rock songs on a future album.
5,Saw Her with Jethro Tull as Well and She Blew Us Away,"I saw Lucia perform last night (October 14th), and amazing is the least I can say about her. She totally rocked the house with her own songs, cover songs (Queen and Zeppelin), and Tull songs as well. Her version of Bohemian Rhapsody was beyond belief and she matched Mercury's vocal harmonies with a violin. She is an amazing talent and even managed to improve an already great performer's show."
5,A real suprise,"This reflects the expansion of the Soviet empire with the culture of a Mongol family in the middle of nowhere and the Chinese in the nearby town. I bought the film to improve my Russian and because it was cheaper, but the Mongolian family speaks Mongolian throughout so subtitles were most helpful. The preparing of the sheep for dinner stands out as an expression of hospitality (and you can not claim no animals were harmed during the making of this film). I found the film shows a different world to make us busy and affluent Americans rethink our lifestyle and consider what is really important in life."
5,Simplicity of the story grabs you,"Having seen this film several times, I am struck by how simple and basic its premise is. Indeed the sweeping landscapes, the daily life of the people depicted and the human relationships (and their quiet intricacy) are what makes this picture compelling. A Mongol family living in a traditional way struggling with the conventions of modern life (limits on how many children a family may have.) Most interesting is seeing the mix of modern life and provincial life when the Mongol man goes into the city with a Russian truck driver. Overall an excellent film; I only wish I had words as eloquent as Urga, the film itself."
1,Scratched Toy,Our horse was scratched up on one side. My daughter cried and cried. I tried to contact the supplier and never recieved any contact back. I would have returned the toy but my daughter decided to she wanted to play with it so we kept it. It was all in the original packaging so I am not sure where the defect occurred; it may have been a manufacturing defect.
5,Smarty Jones,"Just imagine...The bell tolls and the horses are off. Manes and tails streaming behind them, kicking up dust leaving a brown mist. Smarty Jones is among them, coat gleaming from sweat, ears back and listening to everything around him. This model captures the beauty and majesty of Smarty Jones and any hard-working racehorse. I highly recommend this model to any Horse or Racehorse Enthusiast."
5,"Original, fun, good music",Don't hesitate to buy this album. I collect Christmas music as a hobby and Brave Combo is at the top of my list.This album has the best version of Little Drummer Boy I've heard-- they actually had the bright idea to feature the drums! The whole album is original like that. Santa's Polka is wonderful.
1,"oversized, noisy paper weight",My boys got this machine for Christmas. A loving relative sent it by way of Santa in hopes of making their multiple food allergies more bearable. What a major disappointment!! We have followed the directions to a T and get nothing that even remotely resembles a slushie. If you are a grown adult and want to experiment with the machine its up to you but if you have kids don't get their hopes up. It doesn't work.
3,Sugar Drinks work!,"I have only tried this twice, but the first time it did NOTHING. I used a crystal light diet fruit punch I had around the house and decided I'd throw that in. It ran for about an hour. I Put sea salt, ice, and juice in like the instuctions said, but it just made the punch cold. It made a lot of clinking noises and froze to the container three times. It wouldnt even let me put the cap on.The second time I did it, I used grapefruit juice. I read that you needed juice with a lot of sugar so i used grapefruit juice. I let it run after following the instructions carefully and in about 15-20 minutes, I had a delicious very finely made grapefruit slushie with no problems of the machine.If you are on a diet, I would not reccomend this to you, but it is nice to have every once in a while, as long as you use a REALLY sugary drink."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"I received this product as a Christmas gift 2 years ago, but have only used it 3 times. The first two times I was able to get the extremely noisey machine to make slushies using soda after about 30 minutes, which is double the time the manual says it'll take. The last time I used it, I tried Kool Aid, and the whole machine froze up and stopped working. The center rod in the ice/salt container has stopped spinning and actually made the ice/salt intake cap pop off and land on the floor. I thought I had too much ice in it, so I took half of the ice out and tried again, but the cap flew off again. Don't waste your money and don't give this to children, because like my children they will be very dissapointed."
2,Watch Out For Hidden Costs,"The Alen A375 UV Air Purifier is the same as the Alen 350 except adds UV light for germs and Bacteria.I own the following:An Alen A350 = $349 (3 stages, 400-800 sq. ft)Alen A350 Air PurifierAlen A375 = $599 (4 stages, 400-800 sq.ft)Alen A375 UV Ultra HEPA Air PurifierAlive Air Purifier = $319 (9 stages, 865 sq. ft.)Alive Air PurifierPro's1) Has 4 technologies - HEPA, Carbon, Prefilter, UV2) Runs quiet on lowCon's:1)You have to buy 2 HEPA filters on auto-ship to maintain the ""lifetime warranty"" (which will cost $128 a year - even if you don't need it). So the lifetime warranty makes them money.2) The replacement filters are rather expensive.3) It seems like a lot of money to go from $349 to $599 just by adding a few UV bulbs.It does what it says, and I'm glad Alen upgraded the 350 to add UV, however the cost is over the top for this small air purifier."
2,Not what I expected,"Not what I've expected for almost $500. I got it three days ago. It produces ozone smell. On auto mode it can wake you up in the middle of the night because it suddently decides to go full speed. It's not programmable, so you cannot set it up to be turned on two hours before bed time for example like my other ones. Instructions are incomplete and difficult to match with the buttons on the purifier. If the smell doesn't go away, the purifier goes back. I have two other different brand purifiers, I have to admit that they are nosier, but don't smell."
1,2 Units broken,"First unit the fan was ridiculously loud (obviously a problem). The motor spindle was loose or something and couldn't be fixed apparently. They sent a whole new unit. The 2nd brand new unit burnt out after 2 weeks. Electronics smelling (even when the unit is turned off, there is a humming noise and electronics burning smell). This item is junk. Obviously a defective line of products."
1,Just a Fluke I'm Sure,"I researched this product online and decided to take a chance ($500?!)...figured I had 30 days to decide. I waited a bit impatiently for it to arrive but when it did I immediately ripped open the package, plugged it in and....NOTHING. The thing wouldn't even power on. I'm sure it's just a fluke but for the money I decided not try this company again."
2,Nude workout!,"To be honest, I don't like this video. It has full nudity, but the pictures look old like it was made in the 80s. At first, I thought it's going to be all girls workout, but there's a guy in it. I give the video 2 stars for the effort."
4,A very nice read; interesting and well-paced action.,Not a heavy or intense story - the book made for great reading over the Labor Day Holiday. If you've been to this part of the California coast so much the better! I enjoyed the book even though I don't play golf. It would make a nice reasonably priced book to give somebody who does play golf!
4,"Large title, short book",A book for younger readers this story is pretty short. Looking to save your dying garden you buy some cranberry colored fertilizer from a strange man. It works but the vegetables grow huge and are mean to the core. Now you must find a way to destroy the garden but the vegetables have gained intelligence and will try to stop you. A strange amount of ways to die for a child's book I would recommend that it's read by someone in 2 or third grade. It's a book for those that like reading about giant things since the formula can enlarge not only plants but animals as well.
2,Nothing we hadn't heard of...still fresh though,"My son's jazz band plays ""Put It Right Here"", but these guys make it a little bit sad. I wish my son didn't cry over little things like this, but it's understandable."
3,For Herman completists,"This CD is a mixed bag, literally. It contains tracks that were omitted from three other Fantasy albums that Woody recorded in the mid-seventies (""Giant Steps,"" ""Thundering Herd,"" and the yet-to-be-reissued ""King Cobra""). In most cases, they were omitted for a good reason. The pop tunes are pretty lightweight, ""This Time"" features an embarrassing vocal by Woody, and ""Echano"" isn't as rehearsed as it should have been. On the plus side, Charles Lloyd's ""Sombrero Sam"" is a great find, and ""Brotherhood of Man"" is an exciting arrangement based on the version recorded by Oscar Peterson and Clark Terry.I give ""Feelin' So Blue"" 3 stars because I'm a big fan of Woody's, and I'm glad that OJC reissued the album...but I can't help but wonder why they did. Plus none of the soloists or arrangers (other than Alf Clausen) are given credit which drives me nuts."
2,Not the Woody I expected,My recent purchases of Woody Herman albums have been a great dissapontment.My mistake....I did listen to the samples and I still bought them. Next time I'lllisten more carefully.
3,OUTSTANDING IMAGING! Weak thunder!,"This recording is the best I've heard as far as imaging is concerned. The thunder moves slowly from one side to the other... very precise! Close your eyes and you can pinpoint the sound of the thunder... exactly where it is at any moment... BUT the thunder sounds rather tinny. as if they used very cheap microphones to record the sound of the thunder seperately from the sound of the rain. I've seen more than my share of thunderstorms in my life... and this recording is only accurate in how the sound of the thunder moves... not what it sounds like. Thunder starts as a ""crack"" then trails off to very low frequency rumbling as it crosses the landscape. Not so in this recording. The crack is there at the outset... but trails off into rumbling that sounds more like a cheap sound effect from a 1960's sound effects recording. If you have a high-end sound system, you might be sorely disappointed in this recording"
5,Realistic,Purchased for a friend who is leaving Oklahoma and says she will miss the sounds of the storms that we get here.
3,Good product,"Louder than I was expecting ,but that was my fault for not reading the description more carefully. Good condition and sound."
2,not to fall asleep by,"i like to here thunder storms and rain to fall asleep by,but the claps of thunder were way to loud for sleeping through."
5,Sleep aid,"I have a habit of not falling asleep as quickly as I wish. Since we don't see alot of thunderstorms during the winter months, this works GREAT. The sounds of storms help me to go asleep quickly. Wish I would have thought of this a long time ago. Try it if you have the same issues."
2,This thunderstorm is on a short loop. Very disappointing.,The thunderstorm on this cd is on a short loop. You will be listening to the same audio several times before this storm is over. Very disappointing.
3,"i feel satisfied, but.......","In fact, i satisfied, i want about sound of ""nature shocking"".That is the thunderstorm.But some matter make me feel disapppointed.at first i expect endless - big scale - thunderstorms.But 80 percent of sound is just raining. I can find out the 'number of thunderstorm sounds'And the scale of thunderstoms is too small(except some times). i think ""it seems to not thunderstorms but lightning"""
5,Another great live set from the Creator of the universe,"If you believe, as I do, that there is more drama in one thunderstorm than in any ten movies, you'll love this CD. And if rain and thunder move you more than popular music does, buy this immediately. But just a word of warning. If you listen to CD's like this to relax, you should be aware that there are a couple of really LOUD thunderclaps here."
2,Sorry. Not up to par.,"This CD is not recorded with the best of technology's offerings. The rain sounds like spittle, and the thunderclaps sound as fake as something from a 1940's melodrama. Not a lot of reality here. My advice is to buy Thundering Rainstorms. The Thundering Rainstorms CD seemed more ""real"" and less phony. I love the storms of the Midwest, but listening to Electrifying Thunderstorms made me think of horrid old B movies. By the way, if you are making a movie that needs a thunderstorm track, then this is for you. Total ""B"" Movie sound."
2,Weak Thunderstorm,This CD should have been titled gentle rain with thunderstorm in background....not electrifying thunderstorms....I kept waiting and waiting for the storm to build. Finally I figured out the thunder was looped....you can hear the exact same man made background noises over and over...disappointing....
2,Not for relaxation,"I bought this for relaxation, but found that I am basically unable to listen to it. There are some nice periods of rolling thunder or gentle rain, but just as you start to relax you are jolted from your seat by an incredibly loud explosion of thunder. This CD actually RAISES my stress levels."
5,Another absolute best book from Leonard Ravenhill,Leonard knows his Bible! He knows too that many Christians don't. It upsets him that some Christians don't worry about their lack of faith as they should. Leonard wants everyone to know why they should be more intent in maturing in their faith. Great book and a great Christian writer.
5,There is fire between the covers of this book!!!,"I have been so powerfully impacted by this book! It was absolutely amazing! Ravenhill's passion for God, his zeal for the church, and his love of God's Word is so tangible in this book it is fantastic!He calls us back to right relationship with God, he calls us back to life in Christ, and he calls us back to living passionately for the Lord!Do you want to learn how to have greater intimacy with God? Read this book. Encourage, challenge, and stretch yourself as Ravenhill calls us to return to having fellowship with God!Get this book!!By the way, A.W. Tozer was one of Ravenhill's primary mentors, and Tozer was a powerful man of God!"
5,Why Revival Tarries,"Outside of the Bible, the most powerful book I have ever read. If you are ""comfortable"" in the pew, don't read this book. If you are wondering why God has not moved on this earth, then read this book!!! Written in the 50's you would think Ravenhill was sitting across the table from you today! If you are stagnet and want refreshing, then ""buy the book"" POWERFUL POWERFULL POWERFULL."
5,What a powerful book,Leonard Ravenhill pulls no punches in this revival classic. He calls things as they are and challenges the reader to seek God with their whole heart and to deal with their sin in their life. He challenges ministers to be a voice no longer an echo. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone.
5,A book for the ages!!,Leonard Ravenhill is a spiritual giant. His works will challenge you and encourage you in your walk with Christ. This work will lite a fire within your spirit!You will not be able to walk away from this work uninspired.
4,Complete Wilderness Training Book,"Great illustrations, instructions, etc... A must have for anyone learning survivalism, a great gift for boys and men, and of course Mom's who love to camp."
4,A well written and illustrated guide to the outdoors.,"An excellent introduction to the world of the outdoorsfor all those who have been longing to get back to nature.The superb use of illustrations clearly depict outdoor life. From basic gear to the process of cooking a fish,McManners captures the essence camping in a simple how-tostyle. Perhaps the only flaw is the book's lack of asection regarding backpacks. Otherwise, a must have forthose who are seeking info and advice concerning theoutdoors."
1,dumb dumb dumb,"Advice on the level of ""avoid grizzly bears"" and ""tigers are dangerous predators""-(actual quotes more or less). If this is the level of advice you need, this book is for you. Also recommends catching and eating tuna and marlin when in a jam. Thanks for the info."
5,This IS survival,"This is the best survival handbook for quick referance. If you want to take 5 minutes trying to look up one paragragh, The U.S. Army survival handbook is for you. Otherwise, this is an excellent training book. I plan to try to live in the woods for about a couple months. This really helped me prepare. I already tried when I was young. But I came back crying after a week and a half. Now I plan to stay longer, beacause of this.This book includes all the basics of survival. I'm sure there are more detailed ones, but they don't have the basics. This is not really good for a reading book, but it is good for reaserch, as well as training. If you want a good book to live off of the land,this is for you."
2,Save your money for a better book,"Like hellcatty from Hong Kong, my version is also called a survival manual. While there is some information of use in the book, in most areas it is sadly lacking (although it has pretty pictures). For example, on page 63, it shows Mr. McManners doing a bow drill fire. I'd sure like to see him do it in person if this photo accurately portrays his technique. Unless he has arms like Lou Ferrigno, that top hand of his is going to be all over the place. Similarly, on the same page, his portrayal of hand drill fire making leaves a lot to be desired. He states that the hand drill fire technique 'only works effectively in hot climates, where the wood is really dry.'It also works very effectively, at least in my area, in the winter, when it also can be quite dry. His drill also looks somewhat top heavy and unbalanced. Overall, as stated in my title, save your money for a much better book."
3,Good reading for the college football fan,"If you our a Peyton Manning, UT Football or just College Football fan you will like this book. It talks about the recruiting process and what it took to get Peyton to Knoxville and what it took for him to stay."
2,"Good Info, Terrible Prose","Hyams has done his homework with this project. He accumulated material from a wealth of contributors including personalities from Newman High School as well as the University of Tennessee.However, one can tell, after reading the first chapter, this is Hyams, formerly asst. sports editor of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, first foray into penning a novel length book. The content reads like an extended feature story one would find in the local newspaper's sports section.Specifically, the content is choppy and dry. There is no flow, and it is difficult to remain engaged.If I were to assign a grade to this work, I would give it a D+"
4,It's about to get western,"First heard some of these songs on KFAN. Finally saw him live, and it was a grand show. But this ain't yore daddy's country music, this is Western music; Streets of Laredo, Big Iron music. Last Comanche Moon and Whiskey Traders Song rank with the very best western songs ever sung. It's about to get Western, Horses in My String, Too Long at the Dance, all have the great feel of clean west Texas air, sun on your face, riding on a nice horse. Mike also sings of the natives, The Indian Trail, Whiskey Trader & Comanche Moon are as much, if not more, about the Indians as the Cowboys."
1,Ripped almost immediately,"Put sand in the base as recommended on the package. Blew up the bag without incident. Placed the bag on the floor for my 5 year-old to start hitting, and sand appeared on the floor. The cap sealing the sand compartment on the bottom had torn away already from bag. Very poor design of that cap, just a seem tore perhaps when transferring from my lap when filling to the floor. We did do the duct-tape solution as can't return, but would recommend looking elsewhere for a bop bag."
1,Waste of money,This expensive for what it is toy hasnt held air since we first blew it up. My kid is depressed because they had been waiting for it to get here and its garbage.My opinion of Amazon is not reflected in this review. Amazon.com is the only site that I order from online. All my other purchases have been wonderful. Thank you Amazon.
3,ideal for modellers,"have recently seen this video and can recommend it to anyone with a railroad modelling interest in the steel industry.It covers the transportation of the raw materials to the mill, (some archival footage as well), transportation within the mill itself and then final shipping. Lots of interviews with people at the helm during the various stages of transportation.The steelmaking process gets a little explanation along the way,the video is a little lightweight in this respect. You certainly get a new appreciation (as viewed from the inside of the complex)for the sheer size that a Steel Mill must be. Although once again, very little external shots of Blast furnaces."
4,Cooper a Heston.,"Heston made some very unusual films with the likes of E.G. Robinson, David Niven , Orson Welles and others..this is a fine drama regarding the ship the Mary Deare.Its an action and a morality play two in one..with some fine effects."
2,Better but still not Sadler,"Paul Denegelegi's second Casca book is markedly better than the first but still contains a little too much over descriptive passages, making the book a little heavy at times. This story has Casca meeting a young Marco Polo in Venice and then accompanying him to China and the court of Kubilai Khan and he enjoys many adventures there.Dengelegi writes well when battles are decribed but all too often there seems to be a little wandering from the main plot which detracts from the storyline. Sadler wrote in an all-action mode and this is what Casca fans really want, not a ponderous storyline which is why Denegelegi attracts a lot of criticism.One thing I particularly disliked was the final part where the writer attempted to connect this book's storyline with the beginning of his first book and in the process contradicted Sadler's storyline for the character. Careless and with a little more care this would have been avoided."
2,Defiant to the End!,"This latest Casca novel, the 2nd in this new authors Casca tryout, is still unfortunately coming up short.Barry Sadler's Casca novels were fantastic pulp hero type action novels, filling a groove for readers that loved such short novels like Conan the Barbarian could truly appreciate.Out of all of Sadler's writing ventures, only Casca really shined like a well polished blade. I still own all of the series.I am glad and humbled that someone has tried to take up the huge writing reins to continue this series. A solid writer could well take on this saga, giving hungry old readers of the series - as well as new ones - new adventures of Casca, the eternal mercenary. There are hundreds of untold times to pick and choose from.As much as I admire someone making an attempt, this author has come up somewhat short of just making a Sadler pulp adventure story. He shows potential, however. Practice makes perfect.Well, one hopes anyway."
2,"Better, but still a way to go","I have to admit that this is better than his original attempt at this series. The battles are much improved. The problem is that he is still overly descriptive of areas of the story that really does not require it. I found myself skipping pages again. When a reader has to skip pages for a lack of interest, you loose the reader's attention. Sadler had the ability to reach out and pull you into the story, and when you did come up for air or food you were ready to dive back in immediately. In this book, ofttimes I found myself on the outside looking in, and I really didn't care if I finished. The author also had a tendency to stray from the story and loose the plot for a while, which confused me at times.I'm sorry but if this author makes another attempt at this series I doubt I will read it."
2,The only Casca book that ever took me more than an evening to finish.,"As a fan of the original series who sadly lost them all in a move, I was excited to find new stories by a new author. I tried to like this one, I really did, but it just isn't Casca. Others have pointed out most of the book's faults, but one thing nobody has mentioned that plagued me throughout the book was the poor editing. Constant misuse of words like their/they're and other homophones indicates that no real attempt was made to edit beyond simple spellcheck. The editing department gave their job the same attention to detail that was given to the cover art."
1,Not Even Close,Too bad Barry Sadler is dead.. I don't think he would approve of the way Casca is rewritten....
1,Be Warned - only the names are similar.,"If you liked Barry Sadler's Casca books, it is difficult to imagine how you could like this one. Every time Casca would have done X, the imposter in this book did Y. It was like being given something that looks like an apple, but when bitten tastes like burnt liver."
1,Nice Try,"The main problem is that he forgets about Casca. His history seems probable, but I buy these books for excitement and escape, not lessons. His battles are about as interesting as watching ice freeze and I really wanted this to work. I have re-read every BS Casca book several times and wanted something new. If PD writes a new book, I will give him one more try, but if he doesn't improve - no more."
4,Read only the parts on Hogan,"This a fantastic book for pictures of Hogan demonstrating his swing techniques taken for the illustrations in the ""Five Lessons"". Leadbetter makes a very detailed analysis of Hogan's swing and some interesting observations between what Hogan said in his book and how he actually swung. A must for every Hogan fan.However, as soon as Leadbetter starts giving his own ""My Views"", watch out. In ""The Plane Truth for Golfers"", Jim Hardy differentiates between the one plane (Hogan, Snead) and the two plane (Leadbetter). All of Leadbetter views on how to improve on Hogan's swing are two plane ideas which Hardy points out are disastrous for the one plane swing. Read Five Lessons and this book for Hogan's swing and forget all the sections labelled ""My Views"" or you will be swinging the golf club like David Leadbetter, not like Ben Hogan!5 stars for Ben Hogan; 3 stars for David Leadbetter."
4,The Fundamentals of ???,"While I agree with the reviewers who state that Leadbetter certainly adds his own theories and analysis of Hogan's Swing, the book is well worth the money."
3,Piggybacking on hogan,"I am a follower of Ben Hogan and have used his small but brilliant book for close to 40 Years. When I found out that David Leadbetter had written the new book, I immediately ordered it, hoping it would further elaborate on Hogan's techniques. While Hogan's techniques are well-described, Leadbetter then goes on to explain why those techniques won't work for the average golfer. For example, our hands are not as strong as Hogan's, our left thumb is not as long or shaped the same, we are not as athletic as Hogan. It seems that Leadbetter just took this as an opportunity to use the Hogan name to publish yet another book of instruction in his own name, knowing it would be purchased just because of the panache of the Hogan name. I think we have been had."
3,Nice,"I purchased these as a gift for a friend who needed replacements. They are very pretty, but also very delicate. The glass is thin & if bumped the wrong way it cracks very easily."
3,Not So Solid Earth,"1978's Earth follows the pattern of the band's prior two efforts, but not to the same effect. The album is a middling affair with a glossy, slick studio feel that seems highly manufactured. The album is saved by two tracks. First is the gorgeous ""Count On Me"" and second is the rocking ""Runaway"". This seemed the end of the line for the band as both Marty Balin and Grace Slick left the band after this release."
3,A flawed reissue?!?,"I was pleased to see BMG actually going through and re-issue all of the late 70s Jefferson Starship catalog; and for the most part it has been a good-sounding success. However, it appears the transfer of the song ""Crazy Feeling"" has a flaw: right after the phrase ""weather"" it sounds like someone slowed down the recording for just enough time for it to be noticeable--at least to me."
5,Everything is great.,This is a great CD. Also it came very fast. It was in my mailbox way before the date they said it would arrive witch is awesome.
3,I liked Jefferson Airplane back in the day.,"Grace Slick did a pretty good job on this Album, but her and her band were all good on this project."
4,reduplication and onomatopoeia in Japanese,"Great book. It is a small book, but done in a manner that you can very quickly retrieve any information you might need as for all sorts of onomatopoeia and reduplications in modern day Japanese. A must have for linguists and students of Japanese. The introduction of the book is also superb: straightforward, empirical, with easy to understand and retain explanations."
2,A confused mess,"This book can be useful for learning onomatopoeia words but you can quite easily find them in a good dictionary.The big problem with this book is its simply takes the Japanese language and tries to conjure up a sentence so complex that its just boderline stupid. The realtiy is that no japanese person I have ever met talks in such a ridiculous manner and you'll simply make yourself look stupid talking like this.For example a sentence like; ""my wife always bawls me out because I'm no good at pinching pennies""seriously, who talks like that in real life? Nobody. This book could have given examples that made use of the onomatopoeia's without making the sentence sound so ridiculously silly and over the top.Unless you're an experienced student with a desire to conjure up the most silly and ridiculous sounding sentences imaginable you'd be best to avoid this book"
4,MARIA FORD'S BEST,"If you like big fake breasts then you'll love thisunrated farse. There are also several full nuditylesbian scenes. The story is believable, the acting above par and especially Maria Ford whogives her best acting and erotic performance yet.Her bathroom scene where she literally rapes thisguy shows full frontal nudity plus reverse camel-toe (my personal favorite). All of the girlsare superb and I would highly recommend this movie."
2,Weak in the soft porn genre,The Key to Sex is a misnomer for this film. It was not informative about sex in any way.
1,Nokia 6350,"Although the description said that this earbud was for the Nokia 6350, it was not. Was not able to connect when inserted into the plug. Had to return them."
1,Do not buy!,"The first headset had so much static that it was unusable. Replacement sent at no charge, same problem. Gave up. The company was great to work with, but the product is a piece of junk!"
3,Academically oriented.,Managers that have been out of school for two years will benefit more from theor own experiences.Good text for MBAs to chew on.
1,"Whoa, Einstein-dude!",This is the worst business book I have ever read. The connection between his hypothesis on pricing and his discourse on science and mathematics is lacking or at best weak. This is truly voodoo-finance at its worst.
5,A beautiful and sensitive movie,"A beautiful and sensitive movie about a Jewish child , Faygele (Claudia Lander-Duke) , in Russia , in 1927 , whose father emigrates to the USA , intending to send for his family later.However , in the meantime , Faygele's shtetl is burned to the ground by the Communists , and most of it's inhabitants slaughtered.Faygele is spirited to England , where she is renamed Suzie , and brought up in the British middle class.As a young lady (Christina Ricci) Suzie makes her way to Paris , where she makes a career from her talent for singing and dancing.She is befriended by a fellow dancer Lola (Cate Blanchett) , and is romanced by a dark brooding gypsey horseman Cesar ( Johnny Depp)When the Nazis storm into Paris , Suzie is betrayed by the villainous Italian opera singer Dante (John Turturro) and must now decide how to deal with the danger, given her Jewish background.A wonderful exploration of how human lives are affected by upheaval."
4,Great movie -- wonderful soundtrack,"Great storyline. The music by Osvaldo Golijov underwrites the drama of the movie. John Turturro was amazing as one of the lead characters -- the opera singer -- as this is most different from most roles he has played. Johnny Depp was mysterious, deep, distanced but acknowledges the attraction that Christina Ricci's character has for him. Cate Blanchett's character richly unfolds as the movie progresses. Cinematography was very colorful and sets the movie just ""right""."
2,score 2; film 0,"From the haunting opening notes of ""Je crois entendre encore"", through the first scenes with the darling little Russian girl I thought I would like this film. But as it went along, not only did the characters become less believable, they just devolved into broad, insulting stereotypes. The film did pretty well equally insult every race, religion and ethnic group they came across, so it didn't single anyone out. They all seemed like ethnic cartoons! The score, however almost saves it. Well, no, it doesn't. There are plenty of great recordings of 'Les Pecheurs de perles' and ""La Favorita"" out there. No need to subject yourself to this."
4,A movie of depth and compassion,"Sally Potter has done it again. I have never seen characters loved by a lens with all they are and all they are not so hauntingly revealed, yet with no malingering to slow the pace. The little girl Fegele takes it all in, and creates herself as the Suzie she is told to be in order to survive in the world, but finally finds Fegele inside and gradually breaks into her own.The development of the friendship between Suzie and Lola outshines the potrayal of the romance between Suzie and her gypsy lover, Cesar. There was a bit too much left unsaid in the relationship between Suzie and Cesar which is the only critism I have of this movie of depth and compassion.The appearance of Pablo Veron was a well-placed delight which fit into the script nicely.If you like your characters well developed, lovingly rendered, and with a moving story artistically told, you should not miss this film."
5,A MUST SEE,I am a Johnny Depp fan and enjoy watching films that include himin a romantic scene or two. I bought this film and watch it whenever I can and have seen it many times over. It is without a doubt a great film that should not be missed. Depp and Ricciare meant for each other on the screen. Great acting also by Cate Blanchett and John Turturro. One fantastic film!!
2,It had potential...,"First of all, don't let the cover fool you: Johnny's hardly in it at all even though his picture's the biggest. It's a good movie and has a lot of potential, but has a lot to be desired. The movie ends very abruptly without explaining things. There are a lot of plots going on at once; it seems like they move from one to another without ending them. The only one that is really resolved is the first one which involves finding her father, and that one was a little disappointing. This movie creates pretty much a foundation for you if you want to add in your own creative details in your mind. I'd suggest it to watch once, but it's not one of those you want to run back to again and again."
4,A beautiful movie!,I thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of this movie ... the cinematography and editing was stunning as was the wonderful soundtrack. I was moved by the simplicity of the script and appropriate lack of dialogue as so much was captured in the expressions of the fine cast of actors. I found it very believable and poignant ...a must see!
2,Something Lacking/Missing to Make This A Great Movie,"Just so-so film overall..... I think the acting was fine in this movie, the cinematography great and the essence of the story was a good one.... However, something was lacking/missing that left me wanting more from this film.I just felt that more depth could have been added to the main character and her overall early beginnings with her adoptive family.... Plus more on how she went about finding her father in America. The ending of this movie left one wanting to know more answers....Sure Susie was eventually reunited with her biological father, but was it a happily ever after one?? Knowing more about what her biological father had been up to while in America with a bit more detail, would have been great too. Did Cate Blanchett's character make it big in Hollywood? What did Christina Ricci's character end up doing with the rest of her life? And so go the list of questions."
4,"Beautiful,yet a little lacking,film!","Christina Ricci is at her best as the quiet russian who plans to find her refugee father.She plays a woman who as a child was sent to live in england with others.She moves to Paris to dance as ww 2 breaks out.This is the best part of the move,and things go weak when she comes to america.It just seemed like a false ""hollywood ending"".Still a pretty great movie for the most part.The photography,sets,performances, and music are top notch!"
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,The highlight of this movie is the sex scene which is pretty disturbing when you think of Johnny Depp's age (now 39) and Christina Ricci (now 21). Nasty. Don't buy...
2,Kinda lame,"There is something missing in this movie. I dunno, I just don't care about these people. I really want to, but I just don't connect with them. It's a beautiful movie, I must give it that."
1,Poor overall,I'm a long time fan of Depp. But this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I rented it for $1.50 and felt ripped-off.
5,The Man Who Cried,When I saw the trailer for this I couldn't wait to get it and watch it. I love Johnny Depp. He's such a consummate actor. He can portray any character and this is no exception. Loved it!
3,"Nice movie, really","I enjoyed this film, it was nicely shot. Great acting by a great cast. It is simple, yet entertaining. If your a Ricci fan you would appreciate her wonderful acting in this film. Depp Turturro and Cate B, did well in their roles.It was kinda dark, I liked it."
1,a sentimental pastiche,"I am/was a Sally Potter fan. 'Orlando' and 'The Tango Lesson' were fascinating and delightful. 'The Man Who Cried' is neither.The dialog is stunningly bad -- the 'goodbye' scene between Suzie & Cesar is so, so bad I can't believe Sally Potter could have written this without a deep sense of irony? I could tolerate the indulgent cameo inclusion of Pablo Verón if the rest of the movie had weight.The movie was a terrible tease. Harry Dean Stanton with John Turturro in a Sally Potter film -- a must see! Turns out it's a musn't see. A sentimental pastiche.Sally, get yer act together gal, your dad wouldn't go for this one."
2,Regret,"Wow, I think I got suckered into buying this movie after reading some of the reviews which for the most part I really don't agree with. One of the reviews said it was a feast. Sorry but I'd honestly give it only a nibble. I was barely entertained to say the least, and I don't know maybe it's just me but as a huge Johnny Depp fan (which is the only reason I made the purchase) I have to say this was the only movie of his that I've seen that I REALLY could have done without. I was pretty disappointed with this one. It was rather slow movie with a plot that seemed to aim at forms of prejudice, desperate times and desperate women. I really found no real enjoyment in it.,even with Depp featured. I have to give this one a thumbs down if you're looking for a good weekend film. It just didn't grab me at all."
4,A must for Johnny Depp fans,"I have recently started watching and renting as many Johnny movies as I can get my hands on. The movie begins a bit slow, but for anyone that enjoys the artsy, historical flicks that pop up on occasion, you can get through it. The story of the poor little Jewish Russian girl is just beyond sad. Watching Christina Ricci, I couldn't imagine feeling more sorry for anyone. But when she meets Johnny, Cesar, her life changes and she actually finds a smile. Although the dialogue between the two is minimal, it says so much. Johnny has such a way of expressing himself with his eyes and facial features. Its one of my favorite things about him. I definitely recommend this for any Depp fans. I find it an amazing movie and it nearly brought me to tears."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made,"There is no plot, there is no character development, there are three men, all who cry at various points. This is quite possibly the worst movie to actually be released, which is quite an accomplishment considering the stregnth of the actors (Cate Blanchett, Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp).Don't waste your money!"
2,An Unfortunate Scenario For Outstanding Actors,"I rented this movie on recommendation from the trailer. The trailer looked very good, however the movie was abysmal. It was truly painful to see such fine actors so out of place. The story was extremely contrived and maudlin. I just could not finish it out. I watched the last half on forward. Everyone looks wonderful and the costumes and sets are outstanding. The plot reminded me of a Danielle Steele type short story."
4,Sally Potters The man Who Cried,"Sally this is another film of quality we have come to expect from a talented storyteller and director like yourself. You just keep on shining, I found myself totally immersed in this movie from start to finish, and left the cinema with a feeling of total satisfaction, in a story so well told on the big screen, with no feeling of ""seen it all before"" If you enjoy movies with class, go and see this, Sally Potter take a bow for a job well done. I love the movies you make. you are in a class of your own.Keep them coming."

5,"Brilliant and Important Concept, Well Explained and Diagramed","I encountered this book unexpectedly bundled with underground dome plan.It shows how one can save summer's heat and winter's cold for when they're most needed, using earth on site, insulated with foam board, with air tubes conducting the heat and cold from the outside and to the living quarters. It further explains how to set up the air tubes on an ideal site to work without fans. A conceptually elegant, well illustrated and important book, available as an ebook from [...] $50."
1,"Fantastic album, lousy CD.","Bananarama's debut album, Deep Sea Skiving, is one of the hidden gems of the 1980s, and helped launch the career of the most successful girl group in history. ""Aie A Mwana,"" sung completely in Swahili, is their first and one of their best singles. Other classics include ""Shy Boy,"" and a cover of ""Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)."" The whole album is full of catchy beats and great melodies.Now for the bad news. Collectables Records says this CD is ""digitally remastered."" Digitally ""ripped"" is more like it -- the songs on this CD sound like little more than badly ripped low quality mp3s, with the muddled and churny sound typical of them. You'd probably hear better quality on your worn out old casette tape, or perhaps even those crummy mp3s you'd been hoping to replace with your hard-earned dollars by buying this disc.Shame on Collectables for passing these off as legit CDs. Stay away from this one if you don't want to be seriously disappointed!!"
2,"I agree with Edward! Great album, bad remastering.","I am not what you would call an audiophile. And I don't have a thumpin' system in my car, but when I popped it in the player, waiting to hear the girls shine, as I remember them. I was sadly disturbed at the muddled sound. Everything, tiny and flat. Nothing stood out, drums, vocals, high's. I thought, ok the radio has had it. Popped another cd I bought, General Public's awesome""Rub It Better"", what a difference! So I thought, some glitch, put the Bananarama back in, after General Publics album finished. Lot's of driving mind you. I was still dissapointed. Thought I'd suffer through and listen to see if it got better. Nope. The whole time, I'm thinking, it was the album always this bad sounding? Got to drag out the vinyl. NOpe, sounded better. What gives? Why do remasters seem to suck a lot? Is it just me? Is it as Edward who gave it 1 star, better suited for the computer? Anyone else think it sounded bad?"
5,Don't it make you feel good?,"Out of all the Bananarama CD's I own I always go back and pull this one out for long drives or just to lift my mood. It is so fun and bouncy! You hear the girls here at their best. This is before different producers got ahold of them. This is the real sound of Bananrama. Sure it sounds a little dated but this was the sound fresh from London at the time. They were part of a movement like Haysi Fantayzee, Bow Wow Wow, Dead Or Alive, and early Culture Club. Besides the singles, What a Shambles, and Hey Young London are stand out tracks. This CD is good from start to finish!"
3,Not one of her best.....,"This is not one of Charlotte Macleod's best outings--things get a little toooo contrived, and there's hardly any Kelling family in the story (except some juicy stories from Jem)--but it's still a good way to spend a rainy (or snowy) afternoon."
2,She's done better jobs of writing before...,"I had to force my way through this mystery. For books which are read for enjoyment and entertainment, that should not be the case. I've read her books before, and usually they are more tightly written, concise, with a plausible plot. This was not the case in this book, and it felt as though the inclusion of different family members was merely done as afterthoughts to connect to previous books. Very disconnected job... Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
1,A tiresome way to spend an evening.,"Crushingly dull. The characters are bland and too poorly drawn even to be irritating. The plot is pedestrian, with details that are neither relevant nor even entertaining. Luckily the heroine's husband is absent in this book, so we are spared the embarrasment of being invited to share their (probably) tedious bedroom. Disagree with me if you like - just don't ask me to read any more Charlotte McLeod."
2,On Demand made a bad copy,"I saw the original movie ""Lily in Love"" and thought it was wonderful.So I bought the ""on demand"" DVD version of ""Lily in Love"" when I saw it on Amazon hoping to enjoy the movie again. I was quite dissatisfied and returned the item.The reasons were:1. Several scenes were too dark to see well2. It was hard to hear in some places3. The speed of some frames either temporarily halted or sped up.4. It didn't have all the scenes of the movie (it was like it was an ""edited for content"" TV version).5. The DVD cover sleeve also had grammer errors which led me to believe it was a ""home created"" movie.I still love the original full-length movie. Sadly, this product was not it."
3,"Good movie, bad digital transfer.","I had never seen this movie before, but I am a big fan of both Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, and I thought, ""How could I go wrong with this purchase?""The plot is not very deep on any level, but the performances are what you would expect from these two wonderful actors. My problem is with the poor transfer to DVD; it looks like it was transferred from video tape. The images are soft, the color is dark and muted, the audio is not crisp and the dialogue can be difficult to understand at times. The movie is also present in 4:3 format, which is probably a give-away that it was transferred from a video source, rather than the original film.I would give the movie higher marks if the presentation were better. The movie is fine, but the DVD is disappointing."
4,Much better than Seven Days In May.,I first saw this film on HBO and I was really enjoyed it. It was suspenseful and exciting. The characters in the film were also convincing and believable. The film also accurately reflected the opinions on national defense between the White House and the Pentagon.
4,THE ENEMY WITHIN,EXCELLENT MADE FOR TV-REMAKE.ONE OF THE BEST. VERY WELL PACED..ALL THO' THERE ARE SOME PARTS LEFT OUT FROM THE ORIGINAL..BUT THIS VERSION IS MORE GRAPHIC.ALL IN ALLA VERY GOOD SHOW.SNATCH IT UP IF YOU CAN FIND IT..IF NOT CHECK YOUR OLD VHS TAPES..
2,Disappointed,"The Enemy Within is a very poor remake of Seven Days In May. Hard to replace actors like Kirk Douglas, Fredrick March and Bert Lancaster. Even still I felt the actors who were featured in Enemy Within were not up to the task. This is a great story and needs the proper cast to pull it off."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,This so-called book on dyspepsia is a joke. Barely readable because of the print. I've sent it back to the company and I'm waiting for a refund.
4,"WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU is good for me, too...","After having two albums and a recording contract buried by RCA suits with no sense of revisionist blues, Treat Her Right packed up their beer-soaked bar tunes and headed back to Boston where the clubs were small and the recording studios even smaller. The result was 1991's WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, a passionate sampling of the group's ability to turn low-fi swamp muck and raunchy blues obscurities into pure gold. Among the cover tunes were Bob Dylan's ""From A Buick 6"", The Rolling Stones' ""Factory Girl"", and John Lee Hooker's ""Tease Me""--all tattooed with Treat Her Right's 100% Grade-A voodoo. A handful of smart and quirky originals rounded out the disc, making the band one of the best kept secrets of the late 80s/early 90s. Somewhere out there, you know Dr. John is listening to WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU and smiling a big, gumbo-stained grin..."
3,Happy Halloween,This book is less relevant now that the Canadian government is removing the tax exempt status of these funds in 2011.
4,Enjoyable and interestingq,"This was a great book about the witch trials in Massachussetts. I was amazed at how it all began, and how quick the citizens were to jump to conclusions. While I can not attest to the historical accuracies, the book is definitely worth a read!"
3,Factual yet interesting.,"A six for a better than average historical account. This book strips away the mystery of the Salem witch trials and reveals a very human source of the hysteria. The possibilities of another ""witch scare"" exist still today. Understandable and insightful, it should be of interest to historians and to anyone who find this spotlight of American history intriguing."
2,Could have been better,"While the book had the potential to be very interesting, the wording and style only dragged on creating a book not only difficult to read, but impossible to get into."
1,The Devil in a BORING story,"I find the Salem witch trials to be very interesting and I love learning about them. After reading this book however, I am starting to become turned off by them. I am a woman and personally find woman writers to usually be enjoyable. This woman should go back to college or maybe even grade school and find out how to write. She uses complicated sentences that make no sense (you'll need a dictionary or another person to help you out with the meanings of some of her 20-word sentences). Do yourself a favor, pick a different book."
2,Factual errors abound,"While this book, first published in 1949, is very readable, the serious student will be chagrined by it's factual errors.The writing style makes for a pleasant read, and Ms. Starkey does give the researcher clues where to find the real facts, but for the most part, read this book with a grain of salt.For instance, Ms. Starkey tells us that Lady Mary Phips was the widow of her own father... that the infamous George Burroughs was good at raising molasses kegs with 2 fingers... (the story is a MUSKET not molasses!)The errors continue into even more important realms. (Such as which Nehemiah Abbot was released by virtue of the 'afflicted' deciding they had 'the wrong man' - young Abbot's eloquent defense and calm demeanor should not be negated nor glossed over - or worse - attributed to another man!)On and on, one error after another.Frankly, as often as this book is used as a reference, I'm surprised someone else hasn't pointed out the poor research!"
2,It Was the Worst of Times,"If I remember correctly, Starkey's book started off as a doctoral thesis. It reads like one, despite her attempt to inject drama into a period of history that needs no such injection. Her modern enquiry is rather dated now, as she used the technique of Freudian analysis to explain away the hysteria surrounding the trials and to explain how something like this could have happened. The psychoanalysis may hit on a grain of truth, but a lot of what she stated was merely conjecture. I would have been more interested to know about the link between the real dangers the Puritans faced (dangers over which they had very little control in their new, hostile, strange environment) and their belief system, which left them ripe to believe in imagined ones."
4,What is with people's memories?,"People only remember negative things. Fact is when this film came out that both Siskel and Ebert really liked the performance of Lauren Tewes but couldn't actually bring themselves to say go out and see it. This film does manage some genuine scares. Jason-Leigh started her weird career playing a victim and even then went for broke. Remember, Lauren Tewes actually admired, look it up."
3,"head floating in a fish tank, cool!","Ive seen every Horrer, slash movie, Devils, Demons, Stalkers you name it, this movie is as scary as any. I think, that it is the sexual predetor part of the movie, that most people dont like. Jason, Freddie, Micheal, they never stalked anyone to rape them, just kill, mutilate, dismember, decapitate, or eat. go figuer. anyway its not for the squemish. you might want to rent this movie before you buy it."
4,Decent Set for Low Grade Films!,"These films are not great by any means but the set as a whole is well put together in keepcases instead of those horrible slimline cases. I think we could have done without the banner/borders on the front of the cover art stating ""twisted terror collection"" Warner Bros always does a great job with original poster artwork etc... but this I think they are trying to make people believe they are seeing a bunch of films in the same line of Saw and Hostel they are not, which is a good thing."
2,"Poor, oh so poor this is an atrocity!","What a rip offthe price is high the quality is lowI am not talking Rob LoweI am talking a bunch of films that stinkI would rather throw them in the drinkthen waste the overpriced asking of this setI don't even think I will donate it for the wagons headed for TibetJust buy them individually it will cost lessof course the zombies professit is so good!Yeah, overpriced collection"
3,Not bad 80s style exploitationer,"Eyes of A stranger isn't the worst of its kind, and does offer some suspense and likeable characters. There is effective creepiness, such as the killer's cuckoo clock, and the phone calls are decidedly weird. There is way too much nudity however, the film revels in this. But it is an interesting game of cat and mouse as the newswoman makes it a personal vendetta with the rapist sicko. Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is really great, very moving."
1,Don't buy the Amazon DVD-R version!,"There is absolutely nothing wrong about Martin Scorsese's passionate, beautiful documentary. The problem is the DVD-R copy Amazon is selling because not only is this kind of disc going to wear out within a few viewings, but also it does not include Part 2 of the documentary. Watch out!"
1,Missing Part II,"One of the episodes was missing, it said to play one of the CDs on the other side to access Part II but that did not work. It's a three part set."
3,"If You're a Teacher, beware of language and content","This is a little different than I expected, so I was somewhat disappointed. It is mainly people talking about film, rather than showing film with commentary. It is also uncensored, so if you are a teacher and showing it in a school setting, you may want to watching if first, as there is inappropriate language."
2,IMPERFECT TAPE NUMBER 1.,"SOUND QUALITY ON TAPE NUMBER 1. WAS HORRENDOUS, UNLISTENABLE! TAPES 2. AND 3. WERE PERFECT. WISH YOU COULD SEND ME ANOTHER TAPE 1."
1,Amazon should step up to the plate!!!!!,"Amazon should step up to the plate and refund, replace or at least credit customers who purchased the defective 2 disc version of this great documentary regardless of when it was purchased. I purchased this dvd earlier this year but had seen my son's version before so I didn't watch it right away. When I did try to watch it,I was more than perturbed to find that it is missing Part 2 which is supposed to be on the flip side of Disc 1. This is a defective dvd sold by Amazon and they should stand by their product!"
5,Cadillac of portable thickness planers-look no further!,"I'll be brief: I have used this planer with no complaints for about 4 months now. (NOTE: no complaints) I would buy this unit again at twice the price and not think twice. It is indeed a ""Cadillac"" among thickness planers. Easy to use, no detectable snipe, plenty of power to spare. Don't give it another thought....BUY IT! You will have NO regrets!"
4,Contractor,"I've read the other reviews of this product, and I have a question: Did the people who gave this product a bad review know how to use a thickness planer? I plane the HARDEST woods around (African Mahogony, 100+ year-old Antique Pine, etc.) with this thing and it hasn't given me the type of trouble that they complain of. There isn't a planer on the market where you would trust preset depth stops, so they may be off... I wasn't foolish enough to try them. If you want to establish a thickness, use a caliper; no one relies solely on an on-board scale when it comes to that. The only problem I've ever experienced was with the dust chute. When I'm really hogging away at a PT 2x12, and I start getting into wetter wood, it will start to clog (because of a slight design flaw). This is a good all-around portable thickness planer."
2,Loose Chain,"Bought mine awhile back and it did the job fine until the chains that rotate the rollers became so loose they sliped on the spockets. Did a fine job to the wood. Seems the Dewalt Engineers forgot that chains stretch, because there is no adjustment other than to buy a new one or take it to a service center for repairs."
5,Great Planer,"I just bought this planer, no setup, just send the boards through,no snipe. The turret depth stop is wonderful if you are planing more than 1 board and need it to be exactly the same. Then you have the material removal indicator that shows how much material you are taking off. I compared this to the Delta 22560, side by side the Delta is not the machine the Dewalt is. I only paid $40.00 more for the Dewalt, and very glad I did. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it should in my opinion come with the dust hood. Charge more and throw it in with the planer, it's a must have accessory. Instead I had to order it and pay $5.00 shipping. If you buy this planer order the dust hood along with it."
5,Great Planer,This planer worked perfect right out of the box. I have planed hard and soft wood and am pleased with the quality of the finish.The dust collection hood is a little shakey and I would hate to pay the list price for it but I can live with it and may make my own if the mood strikes me. The 4 post lock is the hot setup. I got a snipe on the first piece I planed but that was my fault. The pieces I planed had been planed on my old planer and they were fuzzy. One pass ant the woood could was ready for a finish. I love it.
5,Best Bang for The Buck,"Purchased this Planer localy in Canada, at a significantly Higher price.... Again much like the other reviewers, found it too simple as far as set up out of the box went.Just attach the Column handle...That's it? First board some good old Walnut. Wow did not even need sanding afterwards. Smooth as a .... well you know.This looks like an exceptional value for this tool. If you are even remotley considering a planer do not hesitate at this price.Dale Kerr,Ottawa, Canada"
5,nice machine,"The only thing I had to do to it was to level the in/out feed tables according to the manual. I also removed the silly sticker telling me about the saw dust. I tried the machine on some very dense 7"" cherry and it had no problem taking 1/16"" off and giving me a beatiful shiny flat surface. The locking bar is kind of clumsy to use but works nicely. The dust hood works great and I had it empty into a bag (my dust collector is on order). The extra knives (and the fact that you can sharpen these knives) will save you some more money too. An excellent value with the rebate."
3,Everything is a snap except the snipe...,"The planer works great on short stuff... but... I put a 8/4 X 9"" X 55"" hunk of cherry in and it gouges like the devil on both ends... I've checked and rechecked the level on the outfeed tables... tried holding the stock slighty raised at the start of the feed, tried putting some downward pressure at the start of the feed... tried barely hitting the piece on the pass... tried hitting hard on the pass... still getting the gouges... seriously thinking of returning the product since my 65.00 piece of cherry stock is now worth about 35.00... can't afford to trash any more good lumber..."
5,Solid,"I honestly can't believe that anyone can find fault with this planer(...).My planer has been great. The only problem that I've had with it is that I don't get to use it as much as I'd like. The knives are quality material. If you don't believe me, just look at the two comparable Delta models. The infeed and outfeed tables are almost twice the size of the closest competitors, and the cutterhead lock is three times easier to use than Delta's. The results have been consistent with pine, oak, cherry, and walnut. No complaints.I sell these planers at my second job. We also handle the Delta models. Hands down Dewalt outsells Delta 4 to 1. And they don't come back. I'm not knocking Delta's 12"" planer (the older one), it's a great tool for the money, but their 12 1/2"" model the 22-560 just isn't worth the money compared to the Dewalt. The features, performance, value, and customer service are all there. Thanks Dewalt for producing a quality piece of equipment."
5,Excellent tool for any woodworker,"This is the first planer that i've ever bought but, I have used many different brands, sizes, makes and models. I have read and read on all other planers out there. I must say that I am happy that I went with the DeWalt. The self explanitory controls on this planer make it simple to use. I expected the noise level on this machine to be alot louder than it is, the loudest it gets is when you try to take off the maximum amount per pass that it will take (although hearing protection is still a must). Take your time, and shave off less per pass and the noise will go down as the blades will also last a little while longer. This is a great machine for any woodworker who needs a planer."
2,Less than I expected.,"I read reviews of this product and noticed many complaints about sniping. However, because of the rebate and other price breaks, I went ahead and purchased the Dewalt planer rather than another brand. I now wish I had purchased a different brand. Sniping with the Dewalt planer is a DEFINITE problem and I have ruined many pieces of wood due to it. I also do not like the offset infeed & outfeed extensions. I have several Dewalt tools and like most of them, but the surface planer has been a real disappointment."
3,You don't have to live with snipe,"This planer is OK but it is a little snipey. It started off that way when I bought it a couple of years ago and after trying and trying to adjust out the snipe it is still unpredictable. Expect a little snipe every once in a while from any planer, but the Dewalt delivers it much too often. In my opinion the cutter head lock on this planer is a little weak and I believe it is the source of the problem. I have several friends with the Ridgid and Makita planers who are really surprised when they see snipe, while on any given project using my Dewalt I am surprised not to see it. No offense to anyone but you shouldn't have to trim off the last 4 inches of your lumber to beat snipe. Your planer is an expensive tool and there are some that work better than others. The Dewalt is a sniper, plain and simple. The Ridgid and Makita seem to win this round."
5,Great Litte Machine!,"You will be hard pressed to find a planer that will do a better job than this DW733. Set up was a snap, maybe an hour to remove from the box and double check all adjustments. If you do the basics - keep knives sharp, in and out tables adjusted properly and provide support for long pieces - this machine will give you great results. Snipe is minimal to non-existant. The dust hood & my 650cfm dust collector eliminates 95% of all chips."
2,It doesn't work like Norm's,"After watching Norm plane old wood for years on PBS I decided to join in the restoration fever and salvage some old carsiding that was in good and dry condition. I have spent hours trying to plane that wood to something useable. As I feed the wood in it simply stops. The rollers mark the wood showing that they are trying to move the work through but fail. I have to push, or pull the wood through. These boards are about 7.5 inches wide and I am trying to only take off 1/32"" at a time. Any more than that just chews up the wood. The other dissatisfaction I have is the quality the planer does. The wood is not smooth, it gets chewed up and pieces pulled out. I run it through several times with the cutter just touching and still it looks bad. I've sanded the wood before trying to plane it and that helps a little but it never works like I see Norm on ""The New Yankee Workshop."" I regret this purchase and wish I had bought a better product."
5,Made the right choice,"Ever since last July, when I started my home remodling job, I knew that the tools I purchased would be a major factor in cost and productivity. I've pretty much stuck with DeWalt and I must say that I have not been disapointed. The DW733 planer is my most recent purchase and once again I'm smiling. It works right out of the box cuts wood like butter and the price is right. There are better models out there, but not for my money."
4,Rust!,I took note of an earlier reviewer who had a problem with rust on the posts. I have a problem with rust spots on the exit tray. The exit tray is chrome plated and DeWalt's quality control was poor in this case. The chrome has break-through rust spots all over the surface. This unit has been treated well. It gets cleaned up daily. Since the rust spots appeared I now coat the exit tray with WD-40 but I feel that this should not be necessary. Break-through rust spots are a result of poor quality control when the plating was applied. Operationally the machine performs well.
4,"DeWalt DW733 12-1/2"" Portable Thickness Planer","Great Planer - One recommendation, If you do not own a dust collection system, do not install the ""free"" dust hood. It simply clogs the system down and gets in the way when trying to store the unit."
1,Really poorly built...,"this is a piece of poorly built machinery. I am a homeowner and i know dewalt is made for the homeowner but this thing is (...). It came with the labels on crooked, the scale handle bent and it clogs 3 out of 5 times I use it. I will never buy another dewalt product since i have had problems with all that i bought. you can read about it in my other posts. Ridgid is s better buy. Dont waste your money."
3,From MacCarthyism to Paganism,"Margot Adler is what's known in some circles as a ""VIP"" (Very Important Pagan), and that's why I read this book. What I found is that what little it had to say about the author's conversion to neo-paganism was disjointed and unrelated to the rest of the book. This is mainly a life history spanning the author's early life as the child of fringe American communists, through her college years at Berkley in the midst of the Free Speach and Viet Nam war protests. To me it included interesting history but I didn't see all the conections Ms Adler was making"
3,"good album, i suppose","the first song rules! days of joy, which sounds like another band pfr( mabye because the lead singer is the brother of one of the bandmates of pfr) the whole cd is alright, but nothing to scream about. the production is kind of cheap, but its an alrightalbum. that first song is great for its use of guitar andreally unique melody, worth buying for that song. elsewhere,big fat nothing is also good. not the greatist album in theworld."
5,Landmark record in landmark remastering?,"In 1997, Sony rereleased the full ""The Concerts in China"" on a single compact disc on the Epic label. Beforehand, this album had been available in Europe as a double CD, and from time-to-time, in the Europe and the U.S. as two individual CDs sold separately. For the 1997 rerelease, Sony had Masterdisk remaster the record using 24/96 technology. The result of Masterdisk's work is utterly spectacular and totally superior to any previous form of the album on CD. This is one of the best sounding CDs I have ever heard. Assuming that this product (Sony; ASIN: B00000ILPU) is the same as what I have (Sony/Epic 01-488139-10), then this is absolutely the product to buy. If you already own this album in one of the earlier CD releases, then you may want to consider upgrading. The fact that it all fits on a single disc is nice too."
4,A vintage album,"Concerts in China is, I feel, the best Jarre concert album to date. Pieces like Arpegiator, Orient Express, and Nights in Shanghai exemplify Jarre's ability to compose aggressive, stirring electronic music. The album also features pieces whose arrangements have been localized, such as Magnetic Fields II and Fishing Junks at Sunset, which makes for some interesting listening."
5,Very pleased,"I am very pleased. Can't wait until the framing is done, (I already have it at the store to frame). Can't wait until it is done."
4,Almost,The movie would have indeed been flawless had Demi Moore been able to come up with a better British accent.
4,Demi Moore is actually good!,"An entertaining crime drama starring Michael Caine and Demi Moore. Caine is excellent of course; he always is. The surprise is Demi Moore, who is often derided as an untalented actress who has built a Hollywood career on nothing but canny strategy, an instinct for controversy, and an agelessly hot body. But she is excellent in this film as the terminally frustrated token woman in a stuffy 1960's London corporation. And she sure makes those Ms. Businesswoman power suits look good."
3,Somewhat ugly theft film,"For me the film is slow and overly detailed.The acting is very good by most of the principle players,but the plot drags out time-wiseso that you lose interest.In the 60's the diamond business was pretty much South Africaand British control of the industry to hold prices high.It is the basic monopoly type of business.A janitor and a passed over female executive take them down.Just how? You have to see the movie to find out!But since diamonds are so controlled: if you stole them all,you still couldn't sell them."
3,Flawless Review,Flawless builds up to a great story very slowly. The concept is great! The execution of the plot is wonderful! Both Demi Moore and Michael Caine are superb in the charaters they play.If the pace were a bit quicker it would have been a Great Movie!
4,Nearly Flawless Sleeper of a Movie!!,"I enjoyed the acting very much in this movie. Both Michael Caine and Demi Moore do nice jobs in their performances. The story itself was wonderful as well... Not too slow! I enjoyed how this drama unfolds leaving one curious as to how this heist was going to be pulled off and what an amazing heist it was!The only flaws in this movie were as follows:1) The bad make-up job given to Demi Moore to make her look like an elderly woman at the start and finish of the movie.2) Demi plays a character whom is as cool as a cucumber throughout out most of the movie, then when the heist happens she loses her poise quite a bit and could have completely blown her cover! Sort of thought it was odd for such a poised character to become so rattled if you will.3) The ending seemed undramatic to. I thought there would be a bit more to it."
4,"An Almost ""Flawless"" Thriller","Flawless is a very enjoyable slow-burning caper starring Demi Moore and the inimitable Michael Caine. Demi Moore stars as a top female executive in the 60's diamond industry that is stymied by her gender. Caine is an affable night janitor at the diamond depository with a plan. After Caine gives Moore evidence that her termination is imminent - the two hatch a plan to rob the diamond vault.Flawless was a surprisingly enjoyable heist film and I recommend it. It is not action packed, but a slow moving intelligent thriller with a twist ending."
3,An Average Heist Movie -,"Michael Caine plays an aging janitor out to achieve revenge against a former insurance executive whose prior delays approving treatment had proven fatal for Caine's wife. The 'good news' is that this plot was far more interesting than the politically-correct current version centered around 'blood diamonds.' The 'bad news' is that it was difficult for me to understand much of Caine's dialogue, and the only DVD-provided option was to read the material in Spanish!The really-bad news is that the movie, like too many others, is highly improbable - more like a fantasy."
3,Great acting and brilliant plot spoiled by too many cliches,"Even though I rate this film 3 stars, I actually really liked it. Caine and Moore -- usually not one of my fave actresses -- give top-notch performance, and the supporting cast is also fabulous (esp. Wilson, of course), enough for me to have watched this several times. The heist plot itself (supposedly loosely based on ""true events"" from the 60s) is brilliant.However, I cannot give the film a higher rating because I must blame the filmmakers for including way too many cliched moments, from the incompetent security guard to an old man doing the impossible (and doing it many times) to ""making the world a better place"" message. And the 100 million pound sterling question is not that hard to figure out, if you've watched a lot of robbery films. Anyway, I really wish the filmmakers had made the plot tighter and more believable.Still, a film worth watching... several times, in fact. Moore and Caine are that good."
4,Good Bank Heist even if Politically Correct,"My wife wanted to see this so I rented it and was prepared for a dismal show. I was surprised to see a suspensful little flick that was well made, well acted and very different in terms of execution of the heist than anythign I had seen before. The motiviations of the characters are clear and unclear but all is wrapped up in the end. I could have done without the ""bad diamond company mistreats south africa"" crap that was a back drop to this as well as the ""women were treated poorly in corporate america"" drivel but that was basically background and didn't make the movie an indoctrination film for hippies. Good film."
3,Great actors,I love Michael Caine and Demi Moore. This movie was good but it did drag on a bit. Too many scenes of Demi Moore puffing away on a cigarette. I thought it was just an okay watch. Nothing to run out and rent that's for sure. Ciao
4,The life and times of George Nakashima,"A national treasure who earned his way. The story of George Nakashima is written by his daughter Mira and we learn something about her as well. He was cutting edge and integrated the functionality with the zen of spirit. A samurai of wood?I have heard about him for many years, and he is honored in America and Japan. He wanted furniture to be functional, and able to be lived with. He was the first to embrace the whole tree, which I try to remember whenever I work with wood.As I have mentioned in other reviews I appreciate the skill but also the philosophy and spirit.We also learn that Mira is now in her own element, and the experiences of growing up with Mr. Nakashima that educated her by experience."
5,"great package for safety, compactness","I use these blades quite often, and one of the problems with them is disposing of them properly, like not putting them somewhere where one could be cut or stabbed by one accidentally. This small container has the blades on one side (you extract one at a time) and a place to put the used blades that is both secure and safe. Hey, somebody did their homework and created a mini plastic housing for new and used blades. Kudos to him, her, or them!"
3,Wrong size for my knife,"I thought the #2 in the product title was the shape of the blade. It is not. It is a reference to the size of the knife holder. The blade is too big to fit in my X-Acto Gripster. Otherwise I like these blade dispensers. I use my X-acto on paper items mostly and paper dulls blades really fast, so I like to change blades often and these dispensers are very handy.Now I just need to find a new handle that these blades will fit in."
2,S40 T5 Runs awful,These made my T5 run awful. BAD MPG and idle. Switched back to OEM coppers and it ran like a champ over 25 mpg again.
4,Lost Incas,I bought this because of an upcoming trip to Machu Picchu. The first part about the last days of the Inca kings was very interesting. A lot of the discovery or rather rediscovery part was very interesting. Some of it was tedious georgraphical details that made very slow reading. Most of his comments about the indigenous population was less than enlightened but was probably no worse than most of his generation. It is probably necessary now to read something more modern about the area. I will definitely reread the the first part about the kings right before going there.
3,a discovery of one of the lost cities of the incas,"Bingham's book was written back in the 1940s. This details his adventures in finding the city of Machi Picchu. The city was never really lost, the Indians knew about it all along. Bingham just brought it to the world's attention. Some of Bingham's theories about the Incas have later been proven false. So if you want the definitive explanation of why Machu Picchu exists, this is not the book. Generally this is a good adventure book and details the last years of the Inca Empire before Francisco Pizarro destroyed it. This is located in the first part of the book, which is interesting. The second half of the book details his theories, some of which have been proven false. For those of you planning on visiting Peru and Machu Picchu, read this book."
3,The Lost City of the Incas,"Hiram Bingham goes on an exploration with a couple specialist friends to find the four capitals of the ancient Incan civilization. On the way, he goes through countless jungles, helpful indian cities, and steep mountain trails. The first part of the book is dedicated to informing the reader of interesting information about the Incas. The second and third parts described the trip through ""Inca-land"". I would request this book to anyone who wants to explore the Amazon Jungle someday."
2,Outdated,"Basically this is the only book available that deals with EJB and Oracle Application Server. But the book is outdated. Basically handles only EJB1.0 spec, so the deployment descriptors are old. It does not cover Entity Beans. So if you are using Oralcle 8.1.7 or Oracle 9 i App Server, this book is out dated for you. The flow of topics could have been better. Any way we dont have much choice, as this is the only book on this topic."
1,Waisting of your money,"This book has nothing to do with Oracle. If you are looking for the explanation of EJB, CORBA AND JSP buy separate books about those topics. This one just explaines above technologies in general terms without any link and relation to Oracle8i database. Don't get confused by a title. You WILL NOT find there a topics explaining: - what is Oracle's Java strategy; - how to write java application for Oracle database; - what does Java bring to Oracle database;Try to avoid this book"
1,boring,B O R I N G ! ! ! What more can I say. After the third segment you will wish you had your money back!
2,Not a 9-inch square pan,"This is NOT a 9-inch square pan. The inner dimensions (i.e., the volume available to hold batter) are 8-inches square at the top and 7.5-inches square at the bottom (the walls taper in slightly). It is only 9-inches square if you include the handles, which is not the way baking pans are normally measured.Since I had ordered it for recipes that need the volume of a 9-inch pan, this will not work. However, I give it 2 stars (instead of 1 star) since it is a decent silicone pan for 8-inch square recipes."
2,Not sure,"You definitely need to adjust the temperature and/or cooking times with silicone baking dishes. I found that out the hard way. Also they are flimsy. When lifting something out of the oven, you almost need two people. The bottom sags down a bit."
1,waste of money,"I bought three silicone pans and they burned baked goods,did not cook them in the middle and burned on edges and tops.Besides wasting money on the purchase, I wasted money on the items used in baking.They all are in the garbage!"
2,"Not the best, but an ok try","Jef Raskin is a very intelligent man. However, as a result of his intelligence, many people who do not have the understanding that he does get lost in this read. Maybe this book is not for the beginner. I have had interactive and interface classes before, and read some clearer books."
3,"Some good, some bad, much very annoying","I do not know who edits books on interface design but all too often the books are more about ""look at how great I am"" than thoughtful insights. The beginning of the book offers some good interface guidelines and metrics but around chapter 5 it becomes more about Raskin's ideas than interface design itself. The most laughable is chapter 6-4-3 where he advocates the removal of usernames from login systems to rely simply on passwords. He obviously doesn't understand security and never talked to someone who did before publishing it. He contradicts himself in later chapters with points he makes in the beginning, but if you can look past his constant references to how great his systems are, there is good content in there."
4,"Must-read for developers, even those with ddesigners","This book provides some simple rules to apply to almost any situation in interaction design. Like Design Patterns, it's very text-editor-centric. Also like Design Patterns, though, that's incidental to the fact that it has a ton of wonderful information to provide within that example that apply much more broadly! It should be required reading for anybody whose code interacts with the user.Unfortunately, it can be a little tough to get a good idea of the tradeoff between habits that the user has already gotten and habits that would be better for the user. It's clear there's a tradeoff there, and while the book acknowledges it, it fails to provide much guidance on making designs choices about when you can actually try to 'teach the user something new'."
1,The practical advice is buried in self-indulgent theory,"There are many good insights in the book, but plan on heavy slugging through psychology and philosophy. You'd think a book on UI design would include better techniques for knowledge transfer than page after page of complex prose. If you're looking to expand your mind, buy this. If you're seeking a good UI design tutorial or reference, skip it."
3,great except for light bleed,"We just bought this today. It's looks good in general, but not on a black screen. White light bleeds a lot from the top and some from the bottom."
1,FALSE Description,"I bought this television from Amazon. Twice. Both times Amazon sent the wrong t.v. The reason is because this television does not exist. If you don't believe me, look on samsung's website. The LNS1951D and LNS1952D are not produced. The ""D"" at the end of the product ID stands for ""Integrated ATSC Tuner."" If you buy this t.v., you will not receive the ""D"" version. You will receive the ""W"" version. The ""W"" stands for ""without Integrated ATSC Tuner."" The ATSC Tuner is not included on Samsung Televisions until they are 26"" or larger. I had to send both televisions back and eventually settled for a Sharp with ATSC Tuner. Clearly Amazon refuses to acknowledge this problem and continues to falsely advertise this item. Oh, and Amazon wasn't exactly apologetic either. After wasting a month of my time and hours on the telephone with customer service, they merely offered to refund my money. Thanks Amazon."
1,Don't do it!,"Reading the great (as it turned out, unrealistic, since she is employed by Punch Software) review placed by ""Donna"" I bought Punch Pro and have not been able to do even a simple floor plan on it without multiple problems. Furniture and fixture icons snap to invisible points not in any relation to walls or bearings, the measuring tool is huge and ungainly, sort of like driving a tractor trailer through a garden gate, Furniture icons are a joke I can't even tell a refrigerator from a chest of drawers, furniture building workshop directions are hopelessly convoluted, users manual is absurdly simply minded, altogether a tremendous loss of time and energy for me. If you need to design a home, go buy a tablet of graph paper and one of the home design model kits they sell at book stores, you will be much more pleased with the outcome."
1,"do not buy this if you have a new system, lots of conflicts.","I liked the idea of being able to design a house from scratch, rather than just move walls around. I started with Punch's 5 in 1, but it locked up my system. Their technical support people told me that it was because I was running ME and I should get their professional suite. The professional version locked up my system just like 5 in 1 had. After another hour on the TOLL FREE line, no luck and the product will be returned."
1,Disappointing !,This is inferior to Broderbund's 3D Home Architect--by far ! I thought I was upgrading and adding functionality--instead I was dissapointed with cumbersome programming and limits. Amen to some of the previous comments. Also--you cannot print the 3-D screens as you can with the other software. Don't waste your money. I am sending mine back.
2,Don't buy this to design a new home from scratch,"I was using Broderbund's Total 3D Home to design a new home and wanted to try something more powerful. I purchased the Punch! product and am very disappointed. This product may be okay for drawing an existing home or for finalizing a plan you've already developed. But it is very difficult to use if you are in the early stages and want to move rooms around, re-size rooms, change exterior wall shapes etc.Now that I've tried Punch, I'm going back to Broderbund. It is a far easier package to use."
4,Fast and Easy home design,"After reading several of the reviews of this product, I had to wonder if they received the same product that I did. I have had none of the claimed problems that are mentioned. Walls stop when you want them to (read the instructions) and I created the home I am moving into with a few hours of paying attention to detail and trial and error with the features. I recreated a home that already exists from the dimensions taken from the home. I was amazed at how easy it is to work this program. I have tried to use CAD programs in the past and this is a piece of cake compared to them. I like it so much I am upgrading to the Platinum version for more features. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is because I am upgrading.I have not used the Broderbund program but I don't think anyone with a little computer skill will be disappointed.Buy it...you'll like it."
3,These are just OK,"These are nice enough flip flops but the dangling charm on them can be annoying. The charm can slip between your toes and get stuck. It's easy enough to shake out, but kinda a pain."
5,my wife loved it,These are amazing girly slippers. My wife loved it and ordered an extra pair for future as well.
3,cute but not that comfy,"These thongs were cute, but not that comfortable. When worn for a long time, it rubs the wrong way. The charms are cute, but they get stuck between my first and second toe, which is pretty annoying"
3,Don't be mislead!,"This flip flop is very cute, don't get me wrong. I love it and totally love to wear them. However, they run way smaller than I think they should. I have a generally small foot, but my heel still sticks out the back of them. There is no way this was a size 6M. It was more like a 5M. So word to the wise, buy at least 1 size bigger."
3,Took a long time,"Ordered this on Sept. 17th and recieved it Oct. 1st. 2 weeks. Contacted them 10 days in and they said they were out cuz someone bought them out. Doesn't help me though, i had help lined up this past weekend to put plastic on my greenhouses. This was the cheapest i could find, but give yourself a couple of weeks when ordering it."
5,Don't expect to sleep once you start reading this book!,"Honestly, I only initially picked up this book because I've always had an interest in the Queen Mary. I wasn't able to put the book down. Once I started reading I ignored my phone and plowed through the book throughout the day. I have encouraged others to read the book and have had similar reviews. Even if you normally don't enjoy wartime fiction, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with this book. I'd love to see the movie!!"
1,Schadenfreude Injustice: French Fries vs. Perfect Form,"THIS BOOK IS JUNK TO THE GENRE. UTTERLY MORONIC. FULL OF POSTURING AND BOMBAST AND IDIOM. PREDICTABLE AND INANE CONCLUSION, PREDICTABLE AND INANE EPILOGUE. THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE DROPKICKED INTO IRREPARABLE INSANITY.THE BOOK JUSTIFIABLY DESERVES A ZERO."
1,A movie treatment in book form,"Leaving aside the plot holes and the lack of anything but the most cursory character development, the book is just badly written and in dire need of an editor. Long chapters of synopsis are combined with sentence fragments to create something that reads like a quickly dashed-off screenplay treatment. I'm sure the destruction of San Francisco and the various metahuman/cop battles will look great on screen, but as a book, this makes comic books look deep."
1,A Deflating Turn of Events,"What began as an interesting novel and journeyed into an interesting form of describing humanity and some of our worst shortcomings, ended without any of the characters transforming into something new and preferably better. I felt cheated by how this story ended and refuse to believe that all of humanity is as hopeless, narrow-minded and self destructive as what was represented by the main character, Soledad."
2,Hate Between Covers.,"Boy, was this book a serious letdown. I rushed out to get it based on my love for comics and fictional futures. The premise is excellent, and Ridley's dialogue is like nothing I've ever read. It's true to life and unique. The only thing that let me down was the main character that we're (I think) supposed to be rooting for (or maybe not...maybe this is Ridley's intention). Soledad comes off as a hateful, bigoted, murderous, merciless human being. And it's not even for an understandable reason. Sure, the disaster visited upon San Francisco is horrific...but Soledad's family never made it to the city. They were all spared. This is the one thing that kept me from thoroughly enjoying the book."
1,ugh,"Well folks, I grew up on comics and still love them, although I am not a frequent reader any more. I was excited to hear about this book and eagerly read it, but ....ugh. If you want some quick reading trashy sci-fi type junk, then go ahead and read it. If you are looking for an intelligent treatment of some comic-like themes, then you'd better keep waiting. This is the first novel I have read that has inspired me to pan it here, that's how bad it was."
1,No thank you,"This book has no redeeming features. The main character is unimpressive, being as she is a moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social, racist, whose entire character revolves around her being moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social & racist.The syntax, the pacing, the sentence structure, the dialogue, the imagery are all terribly trite, with no positive side whatsoever. Whats more the entire plot of this novel could be sumed up as ""Hi, i'm an angry, moronic, tempremental, mal-adjusted, anti-social, racist cop... Ask me how.""I actually spent most of this book wondering why the cops didn't just invest in sharpy shooters with sniper rifles.-M"
3,You'll either love it or hate it,"I can really understand why this book can inspire either love or hate. If you've read the Wild Card series edited by George R. R. Martin or the X-men comic books you'll find this book the flip side of what those stories express. I found this book a page-turner in that I couldn't put it down. But I also found the book disturbing in that it seemed to justify a form of racial hatred, a hatred for superheroes. As an African American reader, I kind of wonder what Ridley as an African American writer is trying to say. I do recommend it but I recommend reading it with your eyes wide open. The book does have it's flaws. I found the climax a little hard to believe and the dialogue is clunky. For that I gave it only three stars."
2,Typical Ridley...,"Reading some of the other reviews of this book, I see that I'm not alone in thinking this while it makes for great sci fi/action movie material, it's not a particularly enjoyable read. I've read most of Ridley's work and as far as the character Soledad goes, she's a typical Ridley protagonist.When describing his books to someone who hadn't read him, I foudn myself saying ""you don't read him expecting everything to be all good in the end."" His lead characters are almost never worthwhile as human beings, but the difference in this book is that it's actually easier to identify and sypathize with the primary antagonist, Vaughn. There's more logic behind his murderous actions than there is behind Soledad's.Like some other's have already said: it could be that Ridley is making a statement about bigotry and how it can infect anyone's mind. I just don't feel that Soledad is a character worthy of more than one book."
2,The worst main character ever,"The only reason I kept reading this book was the vain hope that this character would develop some kind of redeeming trait. It never happens, she's treats almost everyone, human or mutant, like crap. She'll watch a mutant save someones life then without hesitation pull out her gun and shoot them. She's filled with blatant, uncompromising hatred and not the least bit of reason or conscience about the people she's murdered. One of the mutants in the book puts it most accurately when he compares her to nazis and klan members.Other than her the book was okay. The action sequences were intense and the other characters were well written."
3,Sleep aid?,"Europeans sometimes seem to believe any music written should be published, played, and distributed. Here is a counterexample: major forces on a widely distributed audiophile label do fancily named pieces by the famous Lizst. All these souls should have watched Manchester United on the telly whilst consuming their bubble and squeak or toad in the hole instead. These pieces just slog on dutifully looking toward ending as respite--my mental picture is of barges on a canal, or hay carts trundling by gorse, both at twilight as clouds gather overhead. Also after realizing Mitteleuropean connection a picture of peasants gathering and preparing mangle-wurzel came to mind. Telarc is bust now, so no need to support the label by buying copies of its least exciting products."
1,The battery that DOESN'T keep going and going!,"I bought this so called extended battery for longer stanby time with my phone . Boy was I disappointed! This battery is supposed to be a Nokia but there is No way it is!!This piece of garbage NEVER EVER held a charge more than 2 days! My old used battery I already had in my phone held a charge for at least 4 days over this ""Extended battery!Do yourself a Huge favor and buy a replacement battery from a cellphone dealer and NOT from Amazon .com.These batteries are worthless junk and are almost like A Cheap Knock off !!!Buyer be very aware !!I only wish Amazon had a slot for NO STARS !!"
1,Don't buy it. It is from recycled.,This battery is recycled from the used cell phone. The power can not be hold even for one day.
5,"Enchanting, relaxing music","I bought this CD after hearing it played on the radio as I drove about town on errands. I fell in love with the Concerto in C for flute and harp, and had to have it. This is the very recording I heard. Fabulous flute, enchanting harp. It carries me away to some wonderful land beyond cares and concerns. Such happy music, beautiful, lilting, inspirational!"
4,Second try was successful,"I ordered the new shower head to replace The identical Waterpik unit I had used for nearly 10 years before something clogged .. when it arrived I tried to install where the other was removed and it would not thread onto the pipe..I thought I had a faulty unit.. Amazon did a great job of doing a return and the second one arrived exactly the same.. So I had to cut off about 1"" of the inlet( any saw will do the job) and remove the filter so it would reach the threads ..Once installed it works great and I look forward to many years of trouble free showers.. The chrome is a bit cheesy and my old white unit was better lookingOverall highly reccomend the product and Amazon for being really great on the return processDavid"
5,Chris Close,"Works perfect! I wish it had a on/off switch on shower-head, but you can easily turn it away from you, just wastes water. Overall 5 star!"
5,"Hand's down, the BEST SHOWERHEAD EVER!!!!","Really, I can't say more than I did in the title.This is, by far, the absolute BEST showerhead I have ever used in my life.Love the multiple settings, love the adjustable height. It's PERFECT!!!I'd give it 10 stars if I could...About 10 years ago, I bought a very similar showerhead (also Waterpik, but all white) and it lasted approx. 6 years. It still functioned properly as far as a showerhead (I actually gave it to a girlfriend to use in her basement bathroom which is rarely used, but had a terrible showerhead), but it made some creaking noises on adjustment and the plastic tubing started to crack from constant adjustment. I purchased this one as a replacement for it...and I LOVE IT!!!!!! My husband loves it as he can adjust it to his height...my son loves having it lowered all the way down so he can shower without getting sprayed in the face...PREFECT!!! :)"
2,Leaks,"I purchased this after reading reviews stating how it was great..I found the force of the water was low even after removal filter, it leaked even putting on only with hand ,and not using tools as suggested in a review and I didnt realize it wasnt going to be long enough for me to thoroughly rinse off...as does a 'hand-held' one which is what I like. I have sent a complaint to the seller and not recieved even an aknowledgement of the email..I'll take my $22.00 loss but wanted to warn others..buy it at your own risk, there may not be a refund, return policy with this item..gave it 2 stars related to promptness of shipping and condition of item"
1,What junk,"I read the paltry installation instructions and did as they said. After 45 minutes I gave up trying to get water out of this supposedly wonderful piece of hardware. Half the time water leaked back up the plastic screw on ""nut."" At no time was I actually able to get a spray of water out of the head itself. (despite several adjustments)I am perplexed how anyone else gets this to work. The passage is ultimately too narrow for the kind of performance demanded by the size of the head. The flexiblity is via a series of plastic ball and socket joints. (again very narrow) The head itself is attached with friction tube (not screw in) that is about one quarter inch in diameter. I am returning this pile of junk."
5,Oh So Clean,"I searched high and low for the perfect showehead. I have a shower stall in one bathroom. Every other shower head would do everything but clean, one even over shot the shower walls. I purchased this showehead and all my gripes disapeared. It's Perfect!! HIGHLY recommended for shower stalls!!! Local stores didn't sell this model. Amazon had the best price and no shipping cost too."
