1,Did not fit my Jeep like it said,I was looking for a nice fitted mud guard for my jeep grand cherokee 2001 and it was more for a dodge dakota. Looks horrible.
5,Bizarre,"Quite entertaining. Erie, funny, and gross all at the same time! Some really good shorts in this one. There is a re-animator spoof that is rather unsettling."
1,Bad...really bad,"I run a website called Bloopwatch.org, and I received a review copy of this film. This was one of the worst movies that's ever been tied to Lovecraft, in my opinion, and I have seen some really bad pieces based on HPL's writing. The centerpiece is a softcore porn version of Re-Animator (yes, I know...another one.) The framing sequence is one of the most painful things I've ever forced myself to sit through. A couple of the segments were at least interesting to watch, but overall, I don't recommend wasting the money or the time. If you want to see good indie horror film-making in the Lovecraft vein, buy a copy of the H.P. Lovecraft Collection 1 and watch ""Cool Air"" or the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society's excellent ""Call of Cthulhu"". Trust me on this."
1,same crap -version number 7???,"the same album of 80s idiots who ruined tr's tunes in their home basment studios, bathed in reverb-it sucks"
4,My Dog Loves These,"I was spending a lot of money on rawhide dog bones at the grocery store, when I discovered the 1 lb bag of retriever rolls. My lab just loves them. They are much more reasonably priced and I have the added benefit of having them delivered to my front door. Although the shipping is a little steep (they are ineligible for Amazon Prime), it is still cheaper than grocery store rawhides."
4,For power chewers,"I've got a 130 lb Lab- not fat- who, at 5 years old, is nothing more than a puppy in a dog suit. He loves the retriever rolls (cut into 1/3rd's) at night to relax him.Too bad Costco stopped selling these."
2,Ouch!,"While these rawhides are large and take a fair amount of time for my lab to finish one, I don't deem it safe. As my dog chews the rawhide, sharp slivers break off and are left behind. I'll walk through the house barefoot and find these sharp remnants wherever the dog was chewing them and they HURT! I can only imagine what it's like for the dog to be chewing and get one of these shards jammed into his gums or worse, swallow one and get it stuck in his throat. I am not a fan of this product."
2,Dog doesn't like them,"My German Shepherd loves chewing, but for some reason, these just do not interest her at all. She'll occasionally carry one around in her mouth from one room to another, but she won't chew them. Maybe other dogs like these, but they were a waste of money for us."
4,My dog loves 'em...BUT,"...just be sure to wash each one before you give them to your dog(s) because during its processing, traces of chemicals are still left intact on the rawhides. My dog used to have upset stomach every time I gave him one of these, so I did a little google research and found out some disheartening information as to why he might be getting stomach aches. Otherwise these are great, his stomach no longer gurgles like crazy and he's keen on chewing these more than ever now. Just wash/rinse them with water inside and out and they'll be fine :)"
2,Hollow Rawhide Rolls Not The Best Chewy Choice,"We bought the 6 pound pack of these rawhide rolls and found out they were hollow on the inside. We understand that they are sold by weight, but the 'hollowness' causes the rawhide to chip off and be eaten quite quickly and somewhat dangerously as choking is a potential problem with the broken off pieces."
4,My Labradoodle Loves These Sticks,I own an 82 pound labradoodle named Riley. He loves these rawhides and they do a great job of keeping his teeth clean. They last a good while as he only finishes 1/2 of a stick when we are outside and we save the other half for our next day outside. I would recommend these to other dog owners.
2,It's a crap shoot!,"Each roll is different, some are so tough it takes my Lab a week to eat it and others are thin and brittle with tiny dry slivers of rawhide in the center and leave a huge mess behind, those he eats in a hour and about 50% of the rolls are just fine.I found this to be the case on different bags I have purchased over a year apart."
2,Dog fell sick,"I have a 1.5 yr old golden who LOVES to chew! These raw hides are tightly rolled up like the others have mentioned and he has to chew through the whole thing. Luckily it doesnt crumble up like another packet i bought from amazon by another seller. However, they are messy like any other raw hide and the package also looks different from the picture shown. Overall a good product and will definitely order again!I had written the above review immediately after receiving the raw hides, and my golden was vigorously chewing through them all! However I started noticing that he used to fall sick the day after he consumed it (I used to give him only one a week). So I've stopped giving it to him now. They are just sitting in my house, and Iv switched to Pork Chomps, which are pork rolls and are 100% digestible!"
5,bones,"Yep, the dogs chewed them up. But one of the two dogs is a puppy so he will chew ANYTHING (house, trampoline, his own leg, etc...) but they both loved to get these anyway."
2,Not for busy chewers,"I bought these 'retriever rolls' for my 18 month old yellow lab. He went through most of one in an evening. They are not very compressed and unroll easily. He got his teeth attached to the end that was unrolling, put his paws on the roll, pulled hard and basically unrolled it like fruit leather. The rolls don't hold up as long as others and I won't be reordering them."
1,Different Quality,"These were of a different quality than the first bag of 20 chews I purchased online. They were the same brand, but the package was different and they were much lower in quality. My dog had diarrhea for two days after downing one of these. They were darker and different colors, compared to the first batch which were white and consistent. I'm almost afraid to order online again."
2,not a US product,"i tried to be a conscientious consumer but there is not any info on AMAZON of where the country of product origin is. BTW it is a product of a South American country which means that the cattle this was derived from injested the toxic chemicals that are sprayed as pesticides , chemicals banned in the US.its a 6 pound bag and they are large but I will not risk my dogs life."
3,Retriever Rolls,"My dog loves most retriever rolls I have given her and these are no exception. She likes them just fine, but I find that they splinter into many small pieces as she is chewing on them and this makes an ugly mess. Other than the mess, these retriever rolls are fine; however, next time I will try another kind of roll. Also, these rolls cost about $1 a roll whereas the last time I ordered rolls (through EBay) they cost half as much (100 for about $50). Maybe the price has doubled over the past year because I wasn't able to find retriever rolls any cheaper than the ones I am reviewing here today."
5,Great bargain,I've found nowhere else that can beat the price of these rawhide chews. They are favored treats for our dogs.
5,Cadet Rawhide Dog chews,High quality rawhide for dogs. Good price. COSTCO has it cheaper but they do not have it in stock all the time. This is the next best source for this product.
4,"A little dry and brittle, but still a good value","Not as good as the ones I used to buy at Costco, but a decent replacement anyway. They are a little dry and brittle, but they aren't as messy as others I've tried."
2,Targus is a better bet!,Try the Targus leather case for the Palm VII. It's better made and much tougher! You can slide in the Palm VII and there is no need for velcro. The Palm VII can also be left in its slip case for added protection and it will still fit into the Targus case.
3,Atmospheric,"This albumn can't really make up it's mind where it wants to be .On one hand there is the excellent and haunting Mr X and the grandiose Vienna but it's the weaker songs like passing strangers , private lives and Astradyne that give it a patchy feel . One feels that Ultravox should have stuck with the moody , atmospheric formula as per Vienna and Mr X . The wailing , fluctuating synth sound on Astradyne sounds cheap and tends to annoy after a while . Sleepwalk is a pounding track while New Europeans dangerously nears the pop borderline which , I think for Ultravox , doesn't work . Ultravox for me are the mysterious , obscure atmospheric band and not the poppy commercial one which on certain tracks , they try to be . This is however , a good album simply because the songs that do work , work extremely well . It is worth buying for Vienna and Mr X alone and these two tracks show Ultravox at their haunting and atmospheric best ."
3,Bland and disppointing,"Without John Foxx, Ultravox had no real focus. This CD was the last one they released before they totally fell on their collective faces.It features some of the listless synthesizer mush that sank their later CD's, but fortunately still contains a few good progressive songs.Best cut is ""Mr.X"", a haunting, dark danceable number. Next best is SleepWalk, a high energy upbeat song that precedes ""Mr.X"" in this mix.Songs like ""New Europeans"" and ""All Stood Still"" were good ideas, but they suffer from a flat, dull mix. On other peices, like ""Astradyne"" it seems that Ultravox is imitating the worst of The Cars (from the time of their ""Panorama"" CD).While Ultravox fans [like me] will not dislike anything here, and fans of Gary Numan & other cutting edge 1980's bands might like some songs here, this is a real retreat from the progressive/art rock of ULTRAVIOX! and SYSTEMS OF ROMANCE."
4,track order,"This is one of my most beloved albums of all-time. Why oh why did they change the track order for the enhanced cd release? Sure I can program my cd player to tweak it back the way it was originally released (I guess I can learn!) The original track order on side one (for you boys and girls who may have heard of vinyl) was perfect! Aw, well it still rocks. Coolest synth band ever! This would've been a max-star review if they had just left the thing intact."
5,This is a very good book for people who have fibromyalgia.,I have fibromyalgia which yeast causes mine to flare up worse. This is an excellent book that helps you understand the connection between yeast and other conditions. I would reccomend this book highly.
5,Great information.,Being a healthcare professional I was suprised that this information was not included at some point in my education. I have seen the treatments advised here work on patients and have used them myself. This is not the answer to everyone's problems however when all other tests have come back with normal values then systemic yeast sensitivity/infection should be considered. I am grateful to the physician who introduced this book to me.
2,Poorly written,"The book offered all the information that I had already read on the internet about Candida. It was poorly laid out and did not offer a comprehensive section on treatments. Yes, it listed some treatments, prescription and over the counter, but it did little in the way of telling me how much of what to take and any complications that may arise from taken them together or separately. All in all a poorly written book about information that is better obtained on the web."
2,A waste of good money,"I was really disappointed in this book and wish I could return it but I guess Amazon won't let me as I've read it. I thought this book would tell me all about yeast - the different kinds of yeast, how yeast operates, and why yeast hurts so much when you have a yeast infection. Does yeast have tiny little jaws filled with sharp teeth that eat away at you? That's how it feels. But this book is mainly a homeopathic book with all kinds of conjecturing about the effects of yeast and telling us basically that yeast is responsible for all of the world's problems. Lots and lots of testimony about various people - Diane here - Eleanor there - who are these people? This book doesn't sound like it was written by a medical doctor. The illustrations are primitive - I could do better and I am by far no artist. Maybe this book will help you if your mindset likes this sort of writing. I wasted my money on it."
3,Not enough on alternative treatment,"I was disappointed after I read the book. It is loaded with explanations on what candida intolerance is and describe in details the symptoms suffered, but there was nothing there that I did not already know by surfing the internet. I found the part on changing the diet very good. My main reason for buying the book was that I thought there would be more on alternative treatment... Yes, the book does say that you should try the probiotic, caprylic acid, echinacea, Co10Q, etc, but does not offer any type of indication as to what standardized extract should be used, what to look for in a specific product, or how much to take and when, to maximize their effectiveness. Now it's back to the internet to find out..."
3,"A comprehensive, but repetitive book about yeast.","The beginning of the book was good, but the information kept getting repeated over and over again and sometimes you would find the exact same paragraph being repeated later in the book. I didn't really learn anything that I hadn't already researched on various websites on the internet."
1,the yeast dis-connection,"I was surprized to find that The Yeast Connection left me feeling disappointed.The lay out of the material is less than ""handy"" and the overall flow of the information that could be helpful to someone setting up a cleansing program is irratically placed through out the book. I also purchased the Yeast Connection Cookbook and was horrified to find the author supplying alternative meat sources such as hippopotamus,lion and giraffe. What's up with that? Have they lost their minds?"
4,ADD SOME PIZZAZZ TO YOUR WORKOUT CLOTHES,"I was looking for workout pants that were comfortable and did look like every other pair of workout pants. I discovered this brand and loved the selection of ""unique"" prints available. I thought I would start coservative and order the plain stripes--not so conservative the stripes are wider than anticipated--sort of a ""Bettle Juice"" look! I work out at an all ladies fitness center, and all of the other ladies have gotten a kick out of these pants. They are comfortable and well made. I suppose they are unisex--they run a little large so I have downsized my next order--going really wild this time and ordering ""Prism"" I am only 5'3"" so they are also a bit long--but I still really like them! If you want to add some fun to your workout clothes give these a try!"
3,Running with Bob Newheart,This was a decent movie of the week when it came out. Sadly whoever listed this doesn't even mention Bob Newhart in the title. It was a bit soapy but running and marathoning gets short shrift normally on tv and the movies. This is worth a look.
1,not what I thought,"this movie was not at all what I thought it would be about. I was hoping for a movie about training and running a marathon, but instead got a sappy movie about a man having a mid life crisis. I did manage to watch the entire movie, but wouldn't reccommend it if you're looking for a ""true"" marathon movie."
5,Revolutionary approach for treating ASD,"It is well researched, easy to read, practical and possibly revolutionary approach, for helping people on the autism spectrum to engage with others. I highly recommend it as a reference book where it can be used to supplement other intervention techniques"
5,"Very true, very real, very helpful","I read this book after being discharged from the hospital for treatment of anorexia. More than any other book, ""Hunger Pains"" made me examine and question the way food, fat, obesity, and thinness are viewed in our culture. It empowered me to want to recover, and to change not only my own life but the society that produces such horrible diseases as anorexia and bulemia. Dr. Pipher is so eloquent and clear in her depiction of how food is conditioned from childhood to be our enemy, and gives very helpful, practical advice for how to develop a healthy relationship with food and weight. I highly reccomend it to anyone recovering from an eating disorder, and also for every woman and every parent of an adolescent girl. It will give you the power and the motivation to look critically at the world around you and to take control over the way it influences you."
1,Blue Block Colored My Baby's Drool Blue!,"My daughter was playing/eating the blue block at a playmate's house when I noticed the drool coming down her chin was blue! I'm glad to know it's a food based dye and non-toxic, but still... a little disturbing."
3,Not for my kid,I wish I had gotten the Plan Toy Shape and Sort instead. My daughter doesn't like the noise of the blocks falling into the box. She also didn't get a sense of accomplishment when the shapes disappeared into the box. She was much happier with it when I put the lid on the floor so the pieces stayed put after she matched them up.It is built really well. My daughter now uses it as her pretend garbage can when she pretends to cook.
4,"Simple, natural toy needs a different lid.","I purchased this shape sorter for my son's first birthday. I was attracted to its simplicity. It's also environmentally friendly...and WOOD. It arrived well-packaged and in a timely manner. The colors are bright and we haven't experienced chipping or flaking. My son enjoys using the toy as intended. He also likes to remove the lid and fill the box with other toys. I don't mind this, but it would be nice if the lid was attached with a hinge or something...to encourage it to be used as intended. Also, the box portion is unpainted and unstained like many other Plan toys, leaving it susceptible to staining. A good rub-down with linseed oil or applying a child-safe water-based lacquer solves this. An overall wonderful toy with some small cosmetic issues."
2,Would be better with a different lid.,"I got this for my 15 month old son. It is a beautifully made toy; great quality and the educational value is definitely there. I only wish there was a way to keep the lid on. My son gets more enjoyment out of taking the lid off and filling the box with toys. I think if there was a latch or a hinge of some sort, he would be more apt to actually try and get the blocks through the holes. I would not buy this particular product again but I will buy from Plan toys in the future."
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in the book when it arrived today - it is not what I expected. I went back and read the description and reviews and still thought I would get more for my money. I am sorry I ordered it. There are far better books to teach the VERY YOUNG a few Spanish words.It was shipped in a timely manner, however.Sincerely, Maggie"
4,Great product!,I use this every day at work. I lost the first pair and I bought some more. Not sure they are worth $8 but they are great other than the fact that they're a little hard to get on and off the headsets. You have to stretch the back out a little.
3,Didn't Notice Any Difference,"Neither I nor my guy could feel a difference. He found his orgasm was not affected by the ""Performax"" creme apparently in the condom. Also I thought it felt a little thick and over lubricated."
2,misleading picture,"The picture depicts a retail package, but received loose (in wrapper) condoms. I ""believe"" that I received the wrong kind - and am in the process of returning them. The reason I am not sure is... The lack of retail packaging."
3,Buyer Beware,"These do extend your performance BUT one broke on me. This is the first time I've had one break on me in 13 years of very ""unconventional and rambunctious"" use. By the way... that was a Durex brand too. I'll think I'll stay away from them. I've used 1000s of Crown brand. They have never failed and feel AWESOME."
4,Awesome Banana Wire Cables,These cables work great in my 5.1 system. I use them for the 2 main speakers and they have provided noticible sound and consistency improvements to my music/games/movies
2,Sounds lifeless,"Replaced Monster speaker wire with Dayton and was disappointed. Highs seemed to disappear, vocals fell into the background, overall sound was flat but not in a good way. Cymbals and drums lost their snap and instrumental detail disappeared. This is just on my system mind you. Overall build and construction was very high."
2,Very Disapointed,"I have been using these chisels for about 3 weeks now and a couple of them are already falling apart. The tools have become loose in the handles, and the pins that hold the brass rings around the top of the handles have broken off so the brass pieces fall off constantly. These chisels would probably be fine for turning spindles from softer, nearly round materials, but they will not hold up when used for turning square stock to round, especially if you are turning hard woods like oak and hickory. The only positive thing I have to say about these tools is that since they are high speed steel, they do hold an edge well. In conclusion, I would not order these chisels again, under any circumstances."
2,they bend -break easy,"I turn wood flutes Native American Flutes and some bowels , I bought these as the price was right and the steel was suppose to be good quality . I wanted them for the short length. Not a week after owning them one of them snapped off at the handle. They seem to not hold a edge for long either. I would spend 30.00 more and get a better set that will not bend or break.Crazy Bear Flutes"
5,"PSI Woodworking LCAN6M HSS Midi Lathe Chisel Anniversary Set, 6-Piece","Nice set of Chisels, I like using the smaller chisels on pen's. I have only had to sharpen once, but felt the original edge held up well with some harder woods that I cut. apear to be well constructed and feel good in your hand. Case is cheap but suitable for its intended use. Overall money well spent!"
2,Only For The Serious Collector,"This is pretty much 'flogging a dead horse', to be honest. If you already have 'The Filth and the Fury' and are on a tight budget, I would recommend the 'Never Mind The Bollocks' DVD instead. Low-budget production values, interviews with whoever happened to be available, even if you couldn't care less what they thought about it all... instantly forgettable."
5,A reliable workhorse,"I've used this printer for more than 5 years now. I use it mainly to print articles that i want to preserve, annotate or proof. About 5-10, 20-30 page articles per week, many of which have fairly complex graphics. By rough estimates i have taken more than 25000 prints so far.The output is fairly fast, the operation is hassle free and intuitive, and the print quality is excellent. I always print double sided, at 300 dpi and in toner saver mode, and i have never had any complaints either in print quality or in terms of operation.I must also mention that it is fairly sturdy and has withstood fairly rough handling and shipping.It has performed flawlessly and efficiently, and economically for my needs as an advanced grad student or as a professional.One of the most satisfying purchases i have made."
3,"Good, but not for DOS printing","""Not for DOS printing? So what!"" For the very few of us in this world stuck using some stone-age software based on DOS like me (local swim team still using a DOS based Paradox database), this one doesn't work. Digging deep into the Brother Support website confirms this fact (of course I didn't check prior to the purchase...shame on me I guess). Purchased because it is one of the few printers still having a parallel port and it's exceptional price for a laser printer (oh yea, and the decent reviews in here). Printed fine via Windows (some page curl as others mentioned), but only used for a day before I realized it would need to be returned.Returning this one and will buy the Brother 2070N which indeed still supports DOS print commands."
3,Good value for home office,"This printer functions quite well, easy to set up and operate, but don't expect to use it in a busy office."
3,Quality prints but pages curl,"The print quality is really nice (I have only used it to print text), but the pages curl no matter how thick or thin the paper. I've used cheap copy paper and expensive 30-pound resume paper, all with equal curling.It's kinda noisy when printing, quiets down right after it finishes, and then goes completely silent about 15 minutes after the last page is printed.I use mine for economical home printing since I print a lot. I was tearing through ink cartridges before I bought this.Great quality prints for the price, but think twice before buying if you plan to use it for business, professional, or resumes (anything where you're trying to make an impression) because of the curling."
1,How to fix if paper feed brakes,"This is how I ""fixed it"" if the paper feed stops working,first, see if the manual feed still works,if it does, then this simple solution is probably the answer.you need to take off the left side panel, the one under the go button and lights.once the side panel is off, in the very front you will see a black gear wheel. Part of the gear wheel has no spikes in it, it's not supposed to.there is a spring, running from a nob on the gear wheal to the printer frame.The defect is, the spring is too weak and over time fail. All I did was make a tighter fit with the spring by stretching out the end, which I know is not an ideal solution because over time this will stretch out the spring. But a spring doesn't cost much to replace on your own, and now my printer which has been broken for 8 months works again.The paper curlsfeed is not perfectlousy printergood for me, because I need to do a lot of printing where quality is not an issue, no a laser printer saves me money."
1,Broke Down After 3.5 years Of Low Usage,Paper jams after every print and takes some knuckle scraping to remove jammed paper. Into the trash it goes. Is 3.5 years all you can expect from a cheap printer that you barely use? I guess so but it still sucks.
1,Kitchen aid Batteur Box,"WEll I'm done with Amazon.com. to many headaches. this last one, what a waste of time.They shipped me the used printer in a box for a kitchenaid batteur mixer. Filled with tiny paper peices with news paper on the side.Wrapped in a white misc paper. corner broken, paper feeder not working. Don't waste your time with anything used. or from this client.Anyone need a box for a Kitchenaid product?My mistake... never again."
2,Electrical problems and curly printouts,"as soon as I plugged in the printer, it caused my lights to flicker. Printed a test page and it blew my circuit breaker. The printed page comes out so curly, it's practically a roll. I'm returning the printer for a refund..."
5,A Very Good Printer For The Money,"After reading several negative reviews about this laser printer, I was a bit reluctant to go ahead and buy it as others were having problems with paper jams. But the price was right and I had some Amazon gift coupons so I thought I'd take a chance on it. I just needed a good black only printer to take the place of several ink jet lemons that are constantly going dry. Well, the Brother was just what the doctor ordered! I use the printer in a home-office environment and haven't had any problems in the past couple of months it's been running. The toner cartridges can be refurbished by a local company here in town although I haven't tried that yet. At any rate, the generic replacements are no more than some ink jet cartridges and they run circles around them in longevity! If you need a good quality relatively high resolution black printer, I think this is the way to go."
4,Cheap and Great!,"This printer is a great value for the money. I have been printing like crazy and have had no problems. Though the paper does curl a bit, this isn't really a big deal. The printer is silent when not in use and a bit noisy when printing but again this is no big deal. Installation took all of five minutes. I would highly recommend."
2,Not very happy with the printer and customer support,"I bought this printer for just a week and printed about 100 pages, then the toner light was on. I cannot print any more from it. I talked to customer support, one lady told me the new printer can only print about 100 pages. Then I got an email reply from the other customer support person, he told me the initial toner can print about 1500 pages. So who is right?Anyway, I finally can print out the printer information by replacing the toner with a brand new one. it says it's already printed 1300 pages. Don't know who did the other 1200 pages.So if you bought the new one, make sure to check the printer information and find out how many pages has been printed. If it's already printed 500 or more, you'd better return it.The print quality is ok, sometimes I got vertical lines. The speed is good.The reason I kept this printer since I've already sent the mail-in rebate and bought a new toner. :("
4,Works great with new paper...,"This printer works great as long as you use paper in the paper drawer that is brand new. I like to recycle my paper and use the back side, but this printer doesn't work well when used like that. First, there's no tray to feed the paper in. So even if you want to use colored paper (or whatever... just not the paper currently in the drawer) you have to feed it in, one page at a time. And when you do, it often jams. Plus it doesn't work well with envelopes. It crinkles them up.But for straight-on, normal printing, it works fine."
5,Excellent printer for the money,The Brother HL-2040 is a very good printer for the money. Prints fast and easy to use.
3,Some disappointments,"Pro. Print quality is good.Con. Paper curls after printing. Paper guides in the manual feed slot do not hold the heavy paper or labels in place, causing paper or labels to feed at an angle."
4,"A good buy, most defininetly.","This printer, prints very well. Quality is amazing and I have had very few glitches setting it up in my home. I use it as a shared printer on a network which can be buggy but its not the printers fault. Highly recommended."
4,Great!!,"I love love love this printer. I am a college student always printing out papers, and at the end of this school year I still have ~10000 (92%) pages left to print on the drum. It is a little bigger for a desk, but well worth the FAST printing time. And it is a little loud (esp. on the powerup). My only problem was when I broke it trying to fix a paper jam (my bad), and the store just replaced it for me for free.Try it!!"
4,Solid basic printer at a bargain price.,"Considering that it is a bargain printer at a good price (mine ended up costing about $73 total) this is a solid product. It is small, relatively fast, and prints text well. Printed quality of shaded graphics and grayscale is poor to fair. I have unresolved problems printing from some Mac classic applications when running in OS X 10.3.9. Also, the printed pages curl a bit. But for the price and purpose, I am satisfied and feel the printer is a good purchase."
4,Solid basic printer,"I bought this printer about three years ago when I was looking for a job. It is a solid printer that does the job. I've had very few problems with it jamming or causing problems. It does have a tendency to curl envelopes or paper beyond the basic printing stock. For my home needs, it's perfect and was reasonably priced."
4,Amazing Printer for the Price..,"This printer served me for thousands and thousands of prints, always delivering up quality prints quickly and without any pain. It never jammed on me, was quiet and overall a great printer. I would still be using it today but I needed to upgrade to a color laser printer, and had no need for both.This printer proudly serves my girlfriend who uses it even more aggressively than I do, and has also had no problems.I love it!"
5,Works flawlessly,"Had it for a good two years. The only time it malfunctions, it's been my fault(when I reuse paper to print on the reverse and forget to take off a staple or scotch tape holding two sheets together). It's also rather forgiving when using paper other than the recommended brand/weight. Sure the toner cartridge is expensive compared to the cost of the machine, but you have internet sellers who ask little more than half the regular street price (say $35 vs. $60). I'm speaking as a home user - the oftmentioned curling problem doesn't bother me, but I can see the problem in an office environment."
4,Reliable but drains the juice!,"This is a well made printer, at a very reasonable price. Easy to set up and to use. My only problem was that I plugged it into the voltage regulator that my computer is plugged into, and when the printer was turned on, it flipped the breaker. I called Brother and was informed that the printer pulls a lot of amperage, and should have its own electricaloutlet. In fact, the customer service representative told me it should ideally have a dedicated circuit. That seems a lot to ask. It's working fine now, but my office lights (home office) do dim, whenever I turn it on. I think that's kind of offputting about it, but not enough to return it."
3,You can get a better printer. Please do and do yourself a favor.,"I don't care if this printer prints well. You'll hear an annoying click on printer startup and every minute or so. More like two clicks, one second apart. I really don't see why they can't get rid of something like that. The replacement unit they VERY GRACIOUSLY sent me has the same problem, so I know it's a Brother feature. Get a Samsung and do yourself a favor."
3,Nice Printer--hideous toner included,"After 3 reams of paper, the included toner ran out.Pretty shocking. I guess Brother has figured out how to tap into the cash cow of inkjet printing."
4,So far so good,"I've only had this printer for 2 weeks. The print quality is good, but obviously I can't speak about durability yet.I have found one thing about it that annoys me. I keep my printer in another room and only connect my laptop when I need to print something. Last time I printed, I ran out of paper before the last page of a document printed, and I didn't notice. Well, four days later I realized that the printer was still making noise (not in sleep mode). It refused to 'sleep' until it was done printing, so the thing was sitting there running for days until I noticed. Probably not a problem for most people who use the printer more often. I hope this incident hasn't caused any unnecessary wear on my new printer."
4,Brother HL-2040 Printer,"Great home printer. And the delivery time was awesome - I ordered it in the afternoon, and it arrived the next day in the afternoon. This was supposed to be 3-5 business days."
3,Installation is a Nightmare,"I purchased this printer yesterday. I printed some materials that I could not very well have printed on my old inkjet printer, and so far this Brother is doing well on these tests.So far so good. But I had a terrible time trying to install the driver on my Mac Power Book G4. The CD that comes with the printer simply would not install the driver on my computer. In fact, trying to use this software disabled my Power Book, and it took the better part of an hour, with the help of Apple Care on the phone, to bring it back to life. Instead of trying to use the supplied CD once more, I was able to download the driver from the Brother website. But even here there were difficulties, because the instructions were confusing and contradictory.If you have A LOT of patience, go ahead and (try to) install this thing on your computer. If you want peace of mind, you better desist."
4,"Good, but noisy","I got this because I needed a printer in my dorm room and didn't want to have to keep buying replacement cartridges for an inkjet printer. For its price, this works really well. It is fast and I haven't had any problems with it yet. My only complaint would be that it's kind of noisy."
4,"Everything is great about the HL 2040, but...","Has anyone tried to print transparencies? I ordered my 2nd HL2040 printer last night and I totally forgot that it had problems printing transparencies. I would love to use this printer for my classroom, however, this won't work for transparencies. SHOULD it? Did I do something wrong? I read the info about Brother HL 2040 online and it CLAIMed that it's able to print on transparencies. Anyhow, the transparency would just get stuck because of the heat, and I found it curled up in the roller! Has anyone tried printing using transparencies before? Please help me!"
1,Extremely Lame,"Not only does the tray not fit A-4 size paper properly, the carteridge is extremely difficult to remove. The printer also constantly jammed. Everything things feels cheap with this printer. In addition, it puts a horizontal creases in your paper when you print. After sending the printer back to Brother for repair, it came doing exactly the same thing to the paper. Take a pass on this printer."
2,A manual duplex mess!,"I upgraded from the 1440. To be honest, I'll probably go back to the 1440! Although the 2040 is faster, it is a mess in manual duplex mode, which I use often. It wrinkles the paper, gets the pages out of order, and pulls two pages through at once. I've emailed Brother to complain. This is truly a disappointment in a Brother product!"
5,Excellent equipment,"I bought this printer for the express purpose of printing 100-page handouts for an anger management class I teach. I've had no problems whatsoever with this printer. It seems very fast, I've never had a paper jam or paper curling. I've not counted copies from the toner cartridges, but I've printed a lot of pages without replacement. After the rebate it was about $[...], so well worth the price. No problems installing with my Windows based OS."
1,Voltage Drop Problem,This printer causes voltage drop problems at my office. It turns out that a person in another office put a UPS on his computer and it regularly started beeping. The electricians came out and tracked the problem down to a voltage drop caused whenever the heating element came on.While it is a nice printer and a good value --- the voltage drop caused great problems in the workplace.
3,Reverse printing on thin paper is a problem,"The price is right, and for single-sided printing, it is a great deal. The problem is with flipping pages to print them on the reverse side. Unless you are using heavy paper (22-24 lb) it is very common for the printer to feed 2, 3, or even 4 sheets of 20lb paper stuck together. My last Brother did not have kind of this problem. Paper curl is also oiut of control. Would be nice to have the exit door on the back to feed sheets through straight, like earlier models had."
1,Don't buy this printer,"I have an experience almost identical to another reviewer. Shortly after I bought the printer, a sheet of paper jammed. After I removed it, all the lights flashed which indicates the fuser is broken. I returned it for a replacement. After another week, the same thing happend all over again."
5,"Good performance, great price","I am very pleased with my new printer. The print quality is excellent, the printer is fairly fast and I can easily print double sided.Installing the printer was easy and the users manual is clear."
4,Brother HL-2040 black/white,"Good price; nice product; Amazon shipped quickly. Only thing that kept me from giving it highest rating - product does not come with usb cord. It meant another trip out to get one (I'm sure most of you have a half-dozen of them lying around, but we were setting up in a dorm.)"
2,they were a great band once,got pulled in by an Amazon review this DVD was great but I did not love it. BTO once was a great band wish this was an concert from the 70's. sorry.
3,Floh De Cologne - 'Tilt' (Westpark Music) 3 1/2 stars,"Band's 1975 effort, as I soon there after discovered that Floh De Cologne apparently still had it (as far as I'm concerned). Tracks here that do make this reissue a keeper are the [noticeable] highly-tuned ""Und Trittst Du In Das Leben Raus"", the rocking ""Grafin Thyssen, Onkel Herbert Und Etwas Zum Abwischen"", ""Bravo-Schicksalstory"" and the seven-minute ""Zug Der Zeit"". Line-up: Dick Stadtler - guitar, bass & vocals, Gerd Wollschon - vocals, Vridolin Enxing - keyboards, cello & backing vocals, Theo Konig - sax, flute & vocals and Hansi Frank - drums & vocals. Overall, a good / decent Floh De Cologne CD to pull out for a spin every now and again."
3,This is not a book. It's nothing but a pack of cards.,"But it's a lovely pack of cards. 54 differnt breeds of cat are lovingly detailed, one breed on each card.This is not so much a pack to play with, unless you buy two of them. This pack is much more beautiful as part of a collection.Note: I haven't purchased any other cards in this series at this time."
2,Not Really Revolutionary,"When you see a title that states the words ""American Revolution"", you expect to watch a documentary on the American Revolution; however, this video is mislabeled. Gordon Wood, an expert on this historical event, never actually discusses the war. Instead, prompted by rambling questions by Roger Mudd, the two discuss some interesting facets of this event, but never nail down easily digested specifics. For 45 minutes, it's essentially two talking heads; that's not always a negative, and as a historian, I did gain some interesting facts and ideas to share with my classes. However, the unfocused nature of the video interview does not hold your attention. The best parts are the snippets on Washington; and at the end, Wood provides thumbnail sketches of Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson that are wonderfully to the point. To get there, unless you are REALLY into history, is tedious."
5,A perfect present for one of their biggest fans,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Then again, she's a big 49ers fan, so of course she'd love it. She loves it so much that she put in her purse as soon as she opened it. I'd recommend it for anybody who's as big a fan as my mom and in need of a new checkbook cover."
2,ANEW is nothing new,"I was very disappointed in this product; it feels like it just sits on my skin surface and doesn't absorb well at all. I like to put a good creme on at night and feel like it's still there in the morning, but this product seems long gone when I wake up."
3,"low cost product, hopefully lasting long enough to soon allow an increase in quality at a price the customer can pay.","The connection is consistent with the rain bird product, i.e. a lot on the cheap plastic side.; (the filter inside plugs up easily, etc.), You get what you pay for; It is step one in the process of consumer education into water conservation,... hopefully better equipment will hit the market at a price that the gardener will be willing to pay."
1,Less than zero,"If I could give this book a rating of less than zero, I wouldawful, don't waste your money."
5,Great Book!,"As a former resident of the Belpre, OH, area, I found this book fascinating. It was a little hard to read in some places but the material more than made up for the difficulty. I certainly hope a sequel is in the works!"
5,Everything the other great bookss dont tell you,"I am experienced C++ in 10 years, and have read many books by the great authorities in C++ in that years.If you have read some books published in recentl years they assume you work with perfect compilers, perfect libraries, perfect language. All three are wrong. This book gives great insities into how to write advanced C++ with reality now, in ""Surviving the Real World"" (Part 2).One important difference between this book is that it shows advanced techniques that will work with many compilers, which soime other books do not - only working with Comeua or GCC compiler.His sense of humor is not what I understand, but that does not stop the writing being telling me important things.Part 1 and 3 are not best ever, but part 2, 5, 6 are all excellent, and worth money.If I had six stars I would give him, because he had been brave enough to look at issues that other famous aithors have never dealt."
2,"lacks the rhythm of the first ""Toot and Puddle""","Though the illustrations are typically charming (don't miss the pigs' turtlenecks), this book lacks the read-aloud timing and rhythm of the first Toot and Puddle book. My daughter loves predictability, but it is hard to guess what will be happening on the next page. Also the inclusion of a third major character (Tulip the parrot) precludes the back-and-forth rhythm that graced the first book."
2,You can afford to miss this one...,"I certainly agree with some of the other listeners, this album is not worth buying. Alot of the music is taken from other albums, but presented in versions that completely lack the fantastic mood and joyfulness that you will find in other recordings, such as ""Underground"". Also, Sezen Aksus voice is a pale comparison with Cesaria Evoras, and therefore the music looses alot of it's flare. No, skip this one, and get ""Underground"" instead. There you'll find some of the best numbers from this recording, toghether with some other excellent tracks, and it's all done with much more heart and soul..."
2,several steps down,"If you have listened Ederlezi or the ""Underground""'s original soundtrack you won't like this one - a lots of excellent tracks from these two and other really good albums have been mutilated, twisted and badly sang in this CD."
4,Good deal,"Good condition, very useful, and a resonable price. I can folder it with my class notes together. It's very convenient."
4,discovering psychology,"The Discovering Psychology book with free study guide came in a timely manner, and we were very happy with the free study guide, which has helped my daughter to prepare for the quizzes and tests."
2,Listed improperly,Ordered the book for school and it was listed tow different ways and looked like series One and Two so I ended up with two of the the same book.
5,please help,im trying to buy this book for this semester starting in aug. the problem is theres no pic of the book. can someone tell me if the cover of this is burgendy & is the 4th edition...author just says 'hockenbury * hockenbury' on the cover. Thanks!!!
2,the book was ok,"look through the book there were really bad highlighter marks and what not. the condition was pretty bad, i was kind of aggitated but yeah. the book came on time though"
5,Yoda,"I'm not really a big Star Wars fan, but I have a Toyota and he's sitting right out front looking his wise old self."
2,Too expensive,"Nothing but a partial copy of CMMI manual. No new explanations or comments to help understanding of CMMI are included. However, If you want a handy copy of CMMI, this book may be useful."
1,Not worth the money!,The price you need to pay for this ready reckoner is too high!You are better of looking the abbreviations up in the SEI spec or in one of the other detailed books.
3,too small,"I have a 2002 Taurus, and the key will not fit into the box. I will have to see if I can have one made to fit the box"
1,Shop around before buying,"This honing tool will work but it's very poorly made. The unit arrived in a ""Craftsman"" box with the quality I've come to expect from Sears. After disassembly, re-fitting the handles to the stone, and re-assembly, it's a reasonable facsimile of a blade honing tool. There are others on the market for much less money that most likely will match or exceed this one's quality."
1,A Rolling Thud,There is nothing here in the history of elevated railways in New York that is not available elsewhere. The personal anecdotes are nothing but filler in this slim volume. The writing style is pedestrian at very best; it reminded me of something written by a college freshman for a beginning English composition class. Spend your money somewhere else.
5,Absolute reading for today's world.,Words to cut to the heart and causes one to look at life and society through different windows. Highly recommend for those who are seeking to gain a better understanding of their relationship with God.
5,beautiful item,now this is a fantastic item really beautifuly crafted something that will make people stop and ask hey where did you get that? you can put a small mantra or charm in this necklace to give you a sense of well being since you can open it up like a locket. this item makes a lovely conversation piece.
4,"Enjoyable, ok Christian romance","Over the Waters by Deborah Raney is the story of Dr. Max Jordan and Valerie Austin as they each struggle to find their way while working at an orphanage in Haiti. Much of the story is a romance, but Raney handles it in a way so that the couple's relationship is really secondary to the rest of the plot and characters. Dr. Jordan's son, Joshua, died in Haiti a year ago while working at an orphanage, so Max travels in his son's footsteps trying to find the same peace Joshua had found. Valerie is recovering from a broken engagement and uses the opportunity to focus on someone other than herself. Max's change of heart comes about rather abruptly, and the backstory of the Greene's seems a bit stretched, but overall the plot flows well and is enjoyable to read. It's an ok book. Don't rush out and buy it, but if you find it on the library shelf, bring it home for a good read."
3,Awsme for a day!,"If you get a chance to rent the PSP or XBox version do that, or wait till the game costs about the same as a rental because it's only fun for about day or 2 and then becomes very repetitious and boring.When I first started playing the game I was amazed by the interactivity of the ocean, but soon became annoyed by the endless tiresom traveling from one city to another just to find the next part of a map. Everything looks the same and blends together after the first 3 hours of playing.All in all, it's a great game to rent or pay less then $5 for, but don't buy it for $20."
3,Pirates? Yes. Repetitve? Yes.,"It could have been better. Sid Meier is a fantastic game-maker, and I hear the original was great. This is apparently a decent remake, however the repetition starts to grate upon you after your fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth time around. It's true that you can increase difficulty, which makes it a bit better, but still....Fights are very scripted and end ususally the same way. Dancing and socializing is more like playing ""Simon Says."" Perhaps this is why Pirates! went extinct on the high seas so many years ago? They all fell asleep at the wheel and were lost at sea...."
2,A slight disapointment,"I went to the store and got this game, (obviously knowing it wouldn't be realistic, pirates lives weren't very fun) expecting a game where I could walk around with a sword and a gun killnig things. Then I could get in a ship and blast a couple defensless sloops of the face of the map. Not so. You have little control over your character, and the ship battles are always short, as firing your cannons constantly is suicide, the main tactic: Board and fight the captain. The sword fights are an extra complex game of Rock Paper Scissors, three attack moves, chop slash and thrust. Chop beats slash, thrust beats slash and thrust, and slash beats nothing. See the dilema? There is a worthless parry for each of those, but that's it. The only reason you win is bcause the AI reflexes are slow, and they attack 2 seconds after you. The only other thing of interest is romance, and the dancing (only way to romance) is repetitive and aggravating. Overall, I'd say go get POTC and mod it to death."
1,uhhhhhh!,I personally thought this was one of the worst games i have ever played.It was very boring and stupid. It was not at all what i expected.
1,How can you review something before it comes out???,"It amazes me that people actually review something before it actually gets released (and there's no beta or demo version out either).Yes, we all know the original Pirates was one of the most highly addicting/best games of all time. If this game is half as fun as the original it will be a huge success. However...all you have to do is look at some other ""remake"" games to realize sometimes this doesn't happen...developers ""monkey"" too much with the game play and it ruins the game (e.g. Master of Orion III). Wait until the game is released (or you've atleast played a demo or beta version before you rate something--otherwise it's just useless conjecture...)"
1,Sid Meier's Pirates,"This is a great game--what you would expect from Sid Meier's. Once you get it to run that is. It is full of bug's. In my case, I spent hours trying different fixes, but I could not get mine to even launch. Atari released a real dog with this one. For details, go to www.atari.com and look into the user forums.Due to the efforts of some clever people in those forums, I was able to find a fix that finally worked, and it was not a real easy one. Note that Atari technical help was able to do nothing for me, other than the usual referral back to my computer maker (""must be a hardware issue""). I am running a Dell 4550, by the way.Like I said, great game for all ages, but I would not buy this thing unitil Atari announces patches to fix the many bugs that you can find discussed on their user forum."
4,awsome game but alittle repetitive but still cool,This game kicks serious.... well you know. It is alittle repetitive but still awsome. The only thing I wish is that you could use exploding cannon balls on enimy ships.
1,Might be good but how to tell,"Pirates! may or may not be a good game. I'm unable to tell because the game does not run for more than 2 minutes (literally not figuratively) without crashing and exiting to Windows. Fixes suggested by Atari make no difference. It has been noted that a patch is in development for the bugs which exist at this time but, be warned, the patch has no due date and the game may be simply unplayable on your system without it."
5,WOW WHAT A GAME!!!!,If you are a fan of sega's Pirates Gold then this is most definetly the game for you! Best game I've played in years!!!!!!!!! A must buy for pirate fans!!!!!!!!!!
3,Newer Sid Meier's Pirates is no different then first,"I bought this game after having the first version. To be honest, I don't see anything different from the first, which is a great disappointment. It doesn't look 3D, I haven't seen any adventures that are different. Perhaps as my grandson plays it more there will be but he's gone back to playing Spore."
1,not listed properly,I could not play this game. It was originally listed as a CD-ROM disc not a DVD. My computer is old and does not have a DVD drive. Please take time to investigate to make sure you are getting the product as described. Contact the seller or Amazon if you don't have a DVD drive on your computer. It would have rated higher if a could have played the game(most reviews were good). I was very disappointed. I hope this review helps.
2,Pirates has 0 replay value,"That is my main gripe. After playing it for a day or two it gets to be very repetitive and dull. The sword fights and dancing are nothing but DDR w/o the catchy songs or flashy lights. Want to build a fleet large enough to take over the world? Good luck as you have to dump your crew and pick up a brand new one quite often. The main character hardly deserves to be called a pirate, he looks like a baby faced pansy. Since when did pirates start wearing such a clean cut look? Where is his parrot, his scar's, I want to hear him say ARRRR!! The reviews are almost right, you can do almost anything you want in this game, except be a pirate."
5,Good clean fun,I bought this for myself but now I have to fight my two boys for game time. Good solid game play that can entertain for more than just a week.
1,Fun..for 10 minutes,"I can't believe people are rating this so high. This game is by far the MOST REPETATIVE VIDEO GAME OUT THERE. Literally, all the swords fights are the same, all the ship battles are the same. After about 10 minutes you find yourself just sailing around doing nothing. You can experience EVERYTHING the game has to offer in 5 short minutes. Here is how:1. Go to the bar2. Hire some guys3. Sail around destroy some ships4. Upgrade ship5. Take over Island6. DanceThats it! You did everything, the more you play its all the same. Rinse, lather, repeat. And in general Sid Meiers games are highly repetitive and overated."
2,Disappoints,"On the plus side the game is a good simulation of the economics of the Carribean and piracy in general. However the CONs are severe. Very quickly calling in ports becomes tedious. I rapidly came to wish I could automate courting Governor's daughters and selling loot. While occasionally the ability to board and duel won a ship that I might not otherwise have taken, the repetitious sequences and settings got dull fast. If dueling and role playing were enhanced this would be a much more interesting game."
4,"Good, however...","Disclaimer: I run Windows 98 with a Pentium III processor.Pros:1. There aren't a lot of pirate games out there. This one fills the void.2. The sea battle are quite well done, though I wish an option was there for you to command multiple ships.3. The swordfighting and land battle features.Cons:1. Swordfights are always the same thing repeated over and over and over again. In addition, at least on my computer, swordfights come in two speeds: fast, and slow as molasses in January--and the speed sometimes changes.2. Going into town: the same thing over and over and over and over and over again.3. Land battles: the same battle over and over again.But it's a fairly good game, if you can take repetitiveness."
2,"Fun at the beginning, boring after a while","The game is very nice at the beginning. First sailings and fightings are cool.But after a while, you keep doing the same things, seeing the same things... Sail a little, engage a ship, maybe duel, and go to the nearest town to sell the stuff you got, etc.And everything just takes sooo long.The most boring part may be dancing. You just press one key depending on what sign the woman is showing with her hand. How fun!Firaxis made great work on graphics and music. But they forgot the game. So Pirates! became a mobile phone game with great picture&sound;."
3,Great Game! (When it works),"I am a huge Sid Meyer fan, and have never been disappointed. This is a bit simplistic as it goes, but that is also what makes it a great game. The only downside is that it was not given sufficient QA before they got it out the door. I have been beating my head against a slew of installation bugs since I installed it, and from the online forums I've seen they are common (did they actually test this thing against, say, more than one video card?).Hopefully the good people at Atari will provide patches now that Christmas is over and we have actually bought the darn thing. If you can get it working, it's brilliant. I recommend it."
4,AAARGH,"This be one of me favorite games, but it needs a few tweaks. Land battles too slow, Daning a pain, towns repetitious, but pirating is still the life for me. It be good with a patch or an expansion pack, then 5 stars may Sid Meier receive."
2,Arrrr!!! This game walks the plank.,"Is this Sid Meiers work? Coulda fooled me. A very limited in gameplay rehash of the highly fun and original Pirates done in a Fisher Price kinda world. Nobodys nation ever gets mad at you for attacking their vessels, so for example you can sink a hundred British traders and the Guvnor of any British colony will still recieve you rather then putting a price on your head. The tasks are rather mundane and repetitive, get the Governor to this Island, help the Abbots out with their problem, and in the end you really dont care wether you do or you dont. Its that underwhelming. Not fun as a fun game and definetly a downward step from the original. 2 stars only because its near Christmas and you must be charitable"
2,"Fun At First, But Then...","I realy love adventure games so i got this one.It seemed very fun and exiting at first.But then later on it gets kinda boring.Also as many people said, it has quite a few problems.Although I had only 1 problem, my friend had a big problem with the game crashing.And the worst thing is that there is no patch for this game!So to get to my point, if you want a game that you want to enjoy for a long time like Counter Strike, then dont get this game.Overall this game is realy fun to play, but when you beat it, you wont wanna play this game agin."
4,GREAT GAME!!!,"Screw everyone who said this game is bad! They are just dumb people who never got into the game. (If you did get in to the game, and didn't like, my apologies)this is a highly addictive game!Every thing great, but two minor problems-Requires decent computer-Can be repetetive.Still overall a great game. Yo ho ho!"
1,SAD,"I have a new computer 2+ GHz Processor, 512 MB Ram 160 GB hd space well over the minimum requirements for the game. I downloaded corrective patch 1.02 for this game from Sid Meiers website. I started playing this game. It seemed like an interesting and fun game, I just started to get the gist of it then WHOOPS crash. Crash retry crash, crash again. wow I'll try to save it every few seconds. crash crash crash. Not fun."
1,Can't get it to work,I have a ATI Radeon 7500 Video Card w/64Mb but the game quitsin port with a VPU Recover message: Graphics no longer responding to driver commands. What the heck is T&L; compatible?I guess this would be a nice game if I could get it to work.Could someone recommend a Video Card that will work. It needsto be plugged into the PCI slot on my Dell 2400 Desktop.
1,Don't Buy This,"Like others, I could not install this on a relatively new computer (XP)which meets all system requirmts. Kept crashing computer, even after repeatedly uninstalling and reinstalling. Downloaded patch, that did nothing. In reading the old reviews, it seems like this problem has been around forever, and they still have not fixed it. Could not get through to tech support line, and they have never returned email. Save your money on this and try Age of Mythology or Age of Empires. They load and play without any problem, with wonderful graphics and no repetition."
1,where are all those stars comming from?,"Yeah, i remember those days playing on the C64 computer. They just copied the game one-to-one. Okay, the graphic is much better but there is just no difference. No new ideas and the game is very random. I was very disappointed about pirates and was hoping it would be a new pirates, not an old pirates. How about pirates II ? After 10 years, there should be a pirates II and not just a new copy of it!P.S. You can download this pirates (for the PC version), called pirates gold from kazaa. You will notice barely a difference! (yeah, the graphic a little)"
3,Gets really old...,"I was very excited about this game when I got it, because I remember loving the old version of Pirates that I played when I was a kid. I think the game basically is the same, with updated graphics of course, but very little in added in terms of gameplay. This game was kind of fun for the first couple of days that I played it, but it got old really fast. Watching the SAME cut scenes and duels over and over was REALLY depressing. It made me question what I was doing with my life. Really. Who want's to do that when you could be engrossed in a decent video game? Bottom line, only buy if you're looking to toot around for a couple of days (at most). P.S. Please note, this is just an opinion, which is probably ridiculous."
1,Fun but too many crashes,While the game has a fun nostalgia effect to it - the system crashes make it unplayable. (My system is top of the line custom built in March of 2005) Constant system lock ups and crash to reset make it not worth the money. Apparently some users have figured out that it is due to incompatability with Intel chipsets...WHAT?...anyway the game company provides no fixes and no forums/FAQ's on the website. Tell you anything??? Bottom line - save your money for something that works as intended.
3,Pirates Game,"I don't have tons of games, but I think the ""pretend-talk"" in which the characters mumble is very annoying. It's an ok game, but I was expecting a lot more for the price."
1,Didn't get a chance to play it,"I know others have written about this but someone needs to mention it again so it's in the latest reviews. This game did not work for me. It kept crashing 10 minutes into the game. My computer has all the right system requirements and I tried all of the recommended fixes. Apparently it's a common problem and a lot of us contacting support were unable to get help or solve the problems...(which are many, even with the patch..or latest version). I'm sure it's a good game but I wish I had seen the reviews about the issues because I wouldn't have bought it and spent the HOURS and HOURS of trying to get it to work."
1,Another frustrated customer,"Add me to the list of those who simply could not get this game to run. My machine more than exceeds the requirements for the game, so that isn't the problem. Tech support was, as usual, unresponsive. Judging from the reviews listed here, as well as the frustrated posts on Atari's message boards, its at best a crapshoot whether this will run for you or not.Suggest everyone pass on this one until its reliability is no longer an issue."
4,fun,reminded me of my childhood. Game arrived in like 2 days and installed with no issue. anti rage. buy it for your kid or big kid!
1,Does not work on Win XP,"The product description showed that it came out in 2004. The disk says 2000. Either way, it does not work on Windows XP or Vista."
4,Fantastic Unknown Funk/Soul Lp from Late 60's early 70's,"A GREAT LP finally issued on CD! Half the songs on this disc are super funky James Brown/Maceo style funk and the other half are groovy southern soul ballads. Not bluesy at all but down home original soul-drenched songs that keep you humming them all day long! I have waited 10 years for this lp. If you like southern soul a la Bobby Patterson, Tommie Young, Roscoe Shelton- you will freak on this! If you just like good soulful singing and funky tunes -buy It too! I cannot express how much I dig this!"
2,Depressing in every way,"Someone told me not to see this, but I foolishly didn't follow that advice. I admit that I didn't see any of Woj's work until years after this movie was released. Plus, I'm a softy and a memeber of the happy-ending-for-homosexuals club (that phrase was coined by Jill Johnston in the seminal work ""Lesbian Nation""). The point being: this movie is tragic, sad, and depressing. This film talks about rape, attempted robbery, prostitution, violence, etc. Near the end of the film David struggles with AIDS and it's barely touched upon. Basically, right when he's about to find happiness, his life ends. (...) Still, this movie was not inspirational; it's just meant to be a downer. The title must be sarcastic: David is not a tourist who would happily relate his new experiences to a close confidante. This was just as creepy as the book ""Gary in Your Pocket."" The Far Right could have a Field Day with this movie."
3,It seems nice but man is it small,"Seems bigger by the measurement. I recommend you buy more than you think you need so you get the job done. I didnt even start to do the job, my box is still wood until I buy more.lol"
4,nice series,"cute model, c-cups & shaved..usual actions of other videos but not any close ups that i remember so keep your finger on zoom button"
3,Great Stuff! ** BUT ORIGINAL FLAVOR NLA **,"Me and my band, Simple Groove, have been using Clear Voice for a couple of years now. We love how it allows us to easily sing those difficult parts of the songs we do when we play out on the weekends. I recently got to try the other stuff, Vocal Eze, and it gave me an instant sore throat. This is the sh**!UPDATE 12/2012: The ""Original Flavor"" is no longer available, so my review no longer applies until I try out the newer flavors. If you order this, you will NOT get the Original Flavor - I got the Mint flavor."
2,Childish Characters Misleading Cover,"Wow. Never judge a book by its cover.... I was expecting a book about two sophisticated socialites, and what do I get? An episode of the Beverly Hillbillies... I really wish I had been able to read the first few pages of this book, but no dice. I purchased it sight unseen. Boy was I disappointed.First, I just could not abide the dialog. The intro: letters written between the hero/heroine which were supposed to be cute, were just immature and childish. I have trouble imagining two adults would write like that. I just couldn't continue after that. This, book has gone directly into the 'resale' pile without a fight. Disappointing!"
5,Wonderful,"Annie Beckett visits Rik Magnusson's farm in order to finishher book about a lost soldier. From the first time they set eyes toeach other oh, the attraction is there. Both tries to hold back firstsince Rik is still in anger after his best friend stole his wife while Annie is not sure about a permanent relationship when her job forces her to run around to almost anywhere. But the attraction is too hot to handle.This book was totally enjoyable. I loved every minute of reading it. One scene that I loved was when Rik brought her daughter, Heather, and her friends to the mall...it was very funny imagining it. A man at the women's area surrounding with female teenagers....It was worth it!"
3,It was a pleasant story. I liked it.,"Characters were good. Plot was pretty good. Allie is researching the disappearance of a soldier from 1832. She comes to Rik's farm to further investigate the land and local sources of information. Allie was abandoned as a child and raised in foster homes. Rik's wife had an affair and left him. As a result, both Allie and Rik have trust issues with loving other people. The story is about half and half: solving the 1832 mystery and the development of the romance between Allie and Rik. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: seven. Setting: current day with flashbacks to 1832 in Warfield, Wisc. Copyright: 1999. Genre: romantic mystery."
3,Wished I could have given a higher rating...,"...because it was sooo refreshing to see a romance novel about adults who were so unflinchingly honest with each other, and a heroine who was sexually experienced and so open and honest about sex. I wish other authors would learn that you can create tension and confict without resorting to the worn-out, overused ""misunderstanding"" or ""failure to communicate"" plot device. The reason I couldn't give this book a higher rating was because the secondary characters should have been written with more depth and, frankly, the sex scenes were disappointing, especially after the terrific, delicious build-up."
4,Good young adult Christian book,"This is a good book geared toward the young adult, though I enjoyed it (and beyond the young adult stage.) Mayla, the main character is a likeable person, with a Mother who both nags and loves her. The way her friends came through for her on her birthday was a 'feel good' part of the story. This book has humor, sadness, and is easy to read as it flows well."
4,Great for teens,This was a refreshing book that would be enjoyed by young adults. I believe the story line was predictable but I enjoyed it anyway. Mayla is a great character and I hope the series continues.
4,A Fun Read!,"The question was compelling. Author Virginia Smith asked, ""Can He (God) really use a purple-haired young woman with a pierced lip?"" The question spoke to my own prejudices so I picked up Ginny's debut novel, and began to read. What I read changed me. It reminded me that no matter where we are in our own personal walk with the Lord, we can be reenergized in our faith. And it also reminded me how dangerous it is to judge someone's heart based on their outward appearance.Ginny's story presents a solid example of the life-changing work of Jesus Christ. But it's also fun read with unexpected twists and turns. I highly recommend it!"
5,Wonderful,"This is a book everyone should read. Very good, laughable, cryable and an excellent story line, had to buy the second book in the series."
4,thought provoking..,"Although I am a Christian,I am NOT a fan of Christian fiction, but this one was free so I gave it a try. My first concern was that people realize that baptism is not salvation. Virginia Smith made this ""fuzzy"". I enjoyed reading Mayas thoughts.Emotions were conveyed so realistic. I was not disappointed to see her change her outward appearance in the end. She is living out Romans 12:1-2!"
5,Great Read!!!!,I downloaded this book on my kindle and really enjoyed it!! Simple but powerful story!! We make being a witness for Christ so hard sometimes and all God is expecting from us is to be ourselves and things will flow divinely!!
4,A nice read,I received this book free on Kindle and was very impressed with it. I am anxious for the sequel to be released for the kindle. This book reminded me what it is like to be a new Christian and left me with the thought of getting more involved in church.
5,"Thanks, Sean","I was fascinated by the events that changed this young man's life and how he then tried to live a new life. I have tried to be as courageous in living out my own life and commitment to God. God Bless you, Sean."
5,Clever gadget,"Clever, useful, and neat looking! This is such a fun item for neat-freak cooks like me. The spoon sets in the holder and lets the mess drip back into the pan. I used it recently for chili and it worked great. I had several people at the football party we were having ask about it. I am going to order several as fun extra Christmas gifts."
2,An intelligent book this is not,"And maybe intelligence isn't what this author's readers are looking for. I, however, was brought to a screaming halt on the first page. The heroine is a caterer, and she decides the morning of a big chamber of commerce function to add a dessert item to the menu. I'm sorry. But the menus for big society functions are approved weeks, if not MONTHS, in advance of the event. Caterers do not add items to menus on a whim. Obviously this sort of ""blooper"" does not bother the audience for whom this authors is writing. It does, however, bother the more discriminating reader."
2,Flawed and Limited Parental Control Features...,I purchased this router primarily for its parental control filtering functions. I was disappointed in that you can easily reach porn sites with this router's porn filtering enabled. The URL blocking also will not block unless the term you want blocked is part of the doc com address. The router was easy to set up and has a stronger signal than the Belkin Wireless G Router F5D7230-4 it was to replace. The Belkin had better parental control filtering options compared to the ZyXel P-334WT. Unfortunately Belkin has horrible tech support and when the free 6 months of filtering on the Belkin expired it would not allow me to renew the service and nobody at Belkin knows what they are doing. Level 2 tech support also does not call back. So it looks like I may need to look for yet another parental control router unless ZyXel has a fix for their parental control flaws.
2,worn out after 6 months,worked great 6 months and worn out...check engine light back again ! if you are ok with 6 months useful life then feel free to buy otherwise it will not last longer than that...(mine did not)
4,The sad life of Arshile Gorky,"This was a good read, though riddled with spelling errors, a result from being OCR scanned I suspect. A second downside is all the images are black and white."
2,Who Are These People?,"I bought this DVD along with the 'Punk Icons' DVD about The Pistols... both are rather pointless to anyone who has really been paying attention to the first wave of pUnK since it began. Oh, well... once DVDs hit the market, there has been an effort to cash in on us old geezers who lived it the first time around before every band was putting out free concert DVDs with their CDs... I would recommend 'Westway To The World' far above this piece of fluff as a nice bit of history on 'The Only Band That Mattered'.(Don't worry - very few of us at the time took that appellation very seriously!)"
5,Frank Study,"An excellent study by one who has done his homework. Straightforward, not avoiding the issues, Patrick Barnes' book must be read by those who believe that ecumenism is the only way to go."
2,Welding Vise Grip Clamps. You get what you pay for...,"These are pretty horrible. Bought 2 sets of 3 in each. One set had one that didn't close at all, in other words it just didn't work. The other set had that Big C lamp that didn't work as well. the bolts wabled back and fourth, didn't hold proparly at all.there are very cheap and definately not worth buying sets. Save $$ for quality that will last."
1,It moisterizes not cleans,"This product does not remove my make up or clean my face. It is however very moisterizing and gentle as it claims to be, but it doesn't do the job it promises. I use it as a moisterizer after I wash my face and then rinse it off but it does hydrate it."
3,"An okay product-- not bad, not great.","This ""cream cleanser"" effectively cleansed my face of dirt, oil, and makeup. However, I have combination skin, and it dried both the oily and the non-oily zones out."
3,Good Story to Okay TPB,"First of all, this book (a graphic story) is based on the story of the same name in Koontz's Strange Highways anthology. And while the story is well-written and exciting, the graphic story version is not as good. The graphics themselves are excellent, but like novel adaptations to movies, this adaptation seemed to be missing something. The pace was too quick and suspense was absent throughout much of the book. The dialogue translated well into word bubbles, but much of the details and description were not left to the imagination. And much of the same were just omitted. So overall, I liked the book, but I would much rather read the story without the pictures. Prose is Koontz's forte, not scripting comic books."
2,Saturday night live 3rd season,"quality was not what I expected,great skits,but grianey,fuzzy . wish they were in blue raypoor quality,hardm to enjoy,waste of money"
4,SNL Stalker,"Delivered quicker than promised. Product was all I expected and more. Ease of purchase was wonderful. Including the rebate due to actual release price being less than originally advertised, this was a great value. Thank you for automatically managing the rebate for the difference in cost."
3,unconventional shape,"OK frisbee, dogs didn't really like the lip. Because of the flexibility, it does not throw as far as we would have liked, but is perfect for training, puppies or dogs with sensitive mouths."
4,"Good book, sorry binding.","This is an excellent vibrations book compared to the offerings of other books on the subject. However, there are a couple of things to note about this book:1.) The description claims that there are many examples in each chapter. That is simply not true if you consider 1 trivial example for each section to be ""many"" examples. My professor kindly reminded me that pretty pictures and examples can be found in undergraduate vibrations books. Also, the matlab code in the book is not available anywhere online or on disk. This makes using the programs rather tedious.2.) The binding came unglued the first week I owned it which is really annoying since I dropped approximately 1 billion dollars on the thing. I would have sent it back had I not needed it.Other than that, have fun!"
4,Common Sense+++,"The other reviewers have stated that The Art of Wealth is simplistic. Nowadays common sense isn't so common and I think that The Art of Wealth is perfect for those of us that aren't so enlightened that we couldn't use a gentle reminder of some of life's most profound truths. I love the book personally because it is applicable to day to day life and the problems associated with ethics and morality when dealing with others. Having a wise uncle or grandfather on a shelf can never hurt, and that is just what this book is, wisdom of the years distilled into book form."
1,I'm not impressed...,This book is basically a bunch of old Sanskrit sayings (much like the things in Chinese fortune cookies) after each saying there is a small paragraph further clarifying the point. Basically I feel this book is worthless for anyone who has common sense.Reed Floren
2,OK if you only want to build a square or rectangular deck...,"After finding that deck builders are getting $25-$35 per sq ft in MI I decided to design my own deck. If you only care about a square or rectangular deck then this book is pretty good. ""The Complete Guide to Decks"" from Black & Decker (available at Amazon.com also) covers the basics plus gives detailed information on including angles, circular portions, steep slope construction and multi-level construction."
4,Everything you need,"I built my deck almost entirely from this book. It's especially good at the structural engineering detail. Some other books try to steer you away from doing your own design. A nice photo selection, but no plans for any of the fancy extras."
5,I laughed till I hurt,"This has become the current family joke now - my sister, upon learning the rules, said ""Well, that sounds really easy."" Boy was she wrong! Somehow, despite the fact that it SHOULD have been easy, it's a lot harder than it sounds. Everytime I tried to blurt out someone else's sound it came out ""Quack!"", no matter what animal I was trying for. There was the mock argument over whether you could count ""Boo"" for ""Moo"" assuming the cow had a cold. And the gibberish that spilled out of everyone's mouths got funnier and funnier. We played it with all adults and laughed till tears were running. And yet, since there is no reading involved, children (over the age of swallowing small objects) could easily play this too."
4,"Well rounded, well put together, different game!","I bought this game for my fourth grade class. They loved it at first sight. It is attractive, fun, and somewhat creative. It is good for short term memory building, muli-tasking, matching, and building social skills. This game involves visual and auditory processing skills. I appreciate a game that is well organized for putting away- everything has a place."
4,Snorta Fun,"Snorta is a fun game if you are in the company of outgoing, loud people. If not, everyone just sits around making lackluster animal noises that actually sound like animals. An overall entertaining party game."
2,some arguments....,"After reading the reviews, we bought Snorta, but we didn't have the same positive experience. There were tears and arguments over who said the sound first, so you may want to come up with a ""house rule"" for that (ties--continue playing, or split cards....)"
3,Wait til Helen comes,This book was very good. But I wasn't expecting it to be boring. But it was a good book. Try it. U might like it.
4,MUST READ for young scary story fan!,"I got this book as a gift and I enjoyed every bit of it even though it is a little predictable. Wait Till Helen Comes is a little charming scary story that is easy to read and has the right amount of spooky/suspenseful elements. I adore all the characters. They might be cliché, but I adore their innocence and their simplicity. I love the place where the story took place. It should be made into a movie, I thought. I only wish that I found this book much sooner. Highly recommend to young people who are interested in ghost story and to parents who enjoy reading scary stories to their adventurous kids. Not only this book is entertaining, it has a hidden message about love, trust and friendship."
4,A good short story,"I liked the ending. It was a bit frustrating to see the parents leave everything to the kids to work out, but it was understandable to some degree, with the struggles of trying to blend two families. I liked the build up of suspense and the final relief of it too. All in all, it was a fun ghost story!"
5,Wonderful Book and Recommended,"I love this book because you never want to stop reading it. It is a spooky storyfor anyone ages 8 and up. This book definitely deserves 5 stars, maybe more."
5,A Great Ghost Story,"I first read this book when I was in kindergarten (almost 11 years ago!) and it has stuck with me ever since. This story tells of Molly, Michael and Heather adjusting to a new life with newly married parents and a new house, next to a graveyard. Then Heather discovers Helen, a ghost of a young girl who died around their house...and trouble soon follows. This book will keep your attention throughout and will stick with you through your life. Even now, I think of the book. My younger brother has yet to read it, and I hope that when he does, it has the same effect on him as it did me."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GHOST STORY.THIS BOOK IS THE KIND OF BOOK YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN!THIS BOOK LEAVES YOU IN SUSPENSE!READ THIS BOOK,EVERY ONE!!!!!"
5,best book ever,omg!!!!!!:)this iz an awesome book. heather it just lyk hellen tho. if u read dis book and u thought it was awesome then u have good taste in books..…!!!(:<3
4,Still scary after all these years.,"I read this book when I was eleven years old, WAY back when it first came out. Just the thought of it still creeps me out. A must for the young, adventurous, and brave of heart!"
5,Excellent Read,"This writers book are always a treat. Even though they are young reader books, as an adult I occassionally enjoy reading her books just for fun. As a writer myself I find her work exceptional on so many levels. The stories are easy reads that pull you in and keep you there to find out what happens next. A young reader will consume her stories - this one included - and be craving more. They are well structured, well executed and just plain spooky fun."
5,Wait til Helen comes,It was such a terrifying yet heart warming story I have ever read it has passion and scary characters best book I've ever read
4,You'll like it. . .,"I read this book when I was in the second grade, Wow! that was a long time ago, I'm 21 now. Anyway, it was my fav. then and is still on my top 100 list of books I've read that I like. If you read it, you know what I mean, and if you haven't you should read it to find out. ..oh if you're wondering what I'm doing looking up kids books at my age, I have a niece now, and I'm collecting books for her, for when she gets older."
3,"Could've been scarier, but......","READ IT ANYWAY!!!!!! Although I only give this book 3 stars, it was one of her better stories. I don't usually read ghost stories, but this book drew me to it for some reason. I think anyone who dislikes GOOSEBUMPS but likes ghost stories will enjoy this book."
1,Review,"It was a very interesting book,I love all the secrets that lurked around the doors as they go to the old burned down hours."
5,Mollys true fear: Clay,"The author of this book is Mary DowningHahn. The title is Wait Till Helen Comes and is about alittle girl who found a ghost friend named Helen.I liked the way this book contained a lot of action. Like when Molly is always following Heather the wicked step-sister and getting in trouble for it. One time the little girl's ghost friend ""Helen'' tried to hurt Molly for it.The theme of this book is no matter what youdo your parents will still love you.I recommend this book to people who like mystery and want to be chilled to the bone."
4,Cute story,Lovely story. I thought is was scary and also taught a lesson to children. I will be purchasing more books from this author for my kids
5,Wait Till Helen Comes,"A amazing and talented great book hat people should all rate five star. Mary Downing Hahn is a great writing skill, escpecially with al her amazing good ranted books. I loveher scary books! The ghost stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Really scary for children,"I had a teacher read this to us in fifth grade. I don't think I'd ever heard anything that completely terrifying and it took months before I stopped having nightmares about it. It's a compelling and well-written story, but adults should exercise their judgment about what individual children can handle in the fright department before they give this to them."
5,Excellent,"I read this novel in fifth grade, 17 years ago, and I still remember how much I enjoyed it. It is a bit scarier than most so-called scary books for this age group. In fact, I bet it could even frighten some adults! I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a good thrill."
5,A scary thrilling story,"I highly recomend this book. It keeps you turning the pages, wondering about Heather, Molly and Helen. It's an exciting story that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, and also teaches you an important lesson of love and friendship"
3,I thought that this book was a good supense/mystery book.,I read this book when I was in 5th grade and I thought it was great. I found it to be a very scary and supenseful book. I think that the characters are very realistic and I would definetly read this book again. I also think it's for other ages rather than just nine to twelve.
5,Actually I'm ... too lazy to create an account,"I remember reading this when I was in fifth grade:) I'm about to head off to my first year at college, yet I still manage to save enough room in my head to retain the titles and plot lines of all the great books I've ever read--next to all those geometry and calculus formulas, of course. This book is splendid...I do think I'd read it again, though I'm quite sure I'm beyond the age recommendation. Cheers! It's a great read:)"
5,Great Gost Story!,"Molly, Michael and their mom were a family until Jean, Molly&#65533;s mom, married Dave, who also has a daughter, named Heather. Heather&#65533;s mom died in a fire and Heather has not been the since, only a bug brat. They all move into a church outside a small town. On the property is a graveyard where a girl named Helen is buried. Heather becomes friends with Helen, the ghost. However Heather doesn&#65533;t know that Helen will try to drown her so Helen won&#65533;t be alone anymore. Molly sees what is going on but no one seems to believe her, and Heather denies it. Soon Helen tries to tempt Heather into the pond to drown her. Molly saves Heather and they become a closer family."
4,classic read,"i was searching for a totally different book from my childhood for my 5 year old daughter (a version of stone soup with two traveling pigs who happen up on a village of other animals... i can't remember the author, so i'm having quite a bit of trouble), when this book suddenly came to mind. i enjoyed it so much 20 years ago, i thought i'd see if it was still in print today. to my delight, it was and i just ordered a copy for myself. can't wait to read it again!"
5,Fond memories...,I must have read this book a million times. This was my favorite book when I was 10-12. This is a great book if you like to scare yourself late at night during rainstorms. I highly recommend this book.
5,Just in time for Halloween,"I have been reading Wait Till Helen Comes with my class for the past five years. Each time I start the book, I am intrigued with the complex characters the the mystery that surrounds them. Heather is the character that you love to hate but as the story plays out, her true self shines through. This books weaves mystery throughout each chapter. It is laden with suspense and leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter. Mary Downing Hahn is truly a gifted author. I applaud her writing style and Wait Till Helen Comes....is the perfect, spooky Halloween treat!"
4,Is it as good as everyone says it is?,"very good book I was convinced that this book would be frightening but I couldn't put it down so I had to get over itAnd I don't think I have read a better ghost story than this, I would recommend it for the people who like those books that you know something is going to happen and then BAM it scares you out of your pants, well that's what I think!"
4,A Tween Ghost Story!!,"Ordered this book from the Amazon website, and really enjoyed it. This is a good book to read about family members and how love will not destroy families determination and understanding can solves problems. This is a good book about family relationships (wheather stepchildrens, or struggles of tweens to get their point across). It is also a good ghost story and I recommend it eventhough I am much older than the characters in the book. Good Reading!"
5,amazing love Mary Downing hahn,This is a good exiting fast pace clif hanger on every page book I couldn't put the book down love it!!!!!!!
5,My Daughter READ it!,"My 11 year old daughter finds reading difficult. Many times she has lost interest in a book and never finished it, but this book she read in record time and she absolutely loved it. She is now referring to herself as a ""reader"" because of the short amount of time it took her to complete it. She is anxious to start another story by Hahn and I am thrilled that she found a book that kept her attention and that she will remember as one of the best books she has ever read."
1,NOTHING SUPREME ABOUT THIS RECORDING,"Bad production, lousy cover and insult to the real Supremes who have by the way offically disbanded. Go get the original recordings and save your money."
1,SHOCKING,"Dont bother with this one..go get the original recordings...i have just placed this where it belongs, how these people dare to use the name The Supremes is way beyond me"
2,WATCH OUT!!! These are NOT the legendary Supremes,"These 3 ladies ARE NOT Motown's legendary Supremes, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard....these are two replacementsfrom the 1970's lineups and one ""never-was"" re-recording goldensupremes classics from the 60's. Lynda Laurence was ""the 15 minute Supreme"" from 72'-73' and Scherrie Payne (the dinamite singer) replaced Jean Terrell from 73'-77'. Freddi Poole? who knows. The only reason i gave this CD 2 stars is because indeed these ladies ARE talented, especially Scherrie Payne who can blow your mind with one singing note (she's amazing), but whyre-record old classics that have been recorded before???"
1,SIMPLY SUPREME? SIMPLY WANNA-BE A SUPREME IS MORE LIKE IT,"PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS CD SIMPLY SUPREME,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SIMPLY SUPREME,GET THE REAL THING WITH DIANA ROSS,MARY WILSON AND FLORENCE BALLARD AND FORGET THIS KNOCK OFF!WHEN I GOT THIS CD, I PLAYED IT IN MY CAR AND THEN THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW.YES IT'S THAT BAD! THESE SUPREME WANNA-BE'S EVEN HAS A CD WITH DIANA,MARY AND FLORENCE ON THE COVER AND ANOTHER WITH JEAN TERRELL AND MARY WILSON AND CINDY BIRDSONG ON A COVER. THEY HAVE TO MISLEAD BUYERS TO BUY THEIR CDS. IN MY OPINION SHERRI PAYNE AND LYNDA LAURENCE HAS NO RIGHT CALLING THEMSELVES SUPREMES,UNLESS THEIR STANDING NEXT TO MARY WILSON,WHO GAVE THEM THEIR BIG BREAK TO BE A SUPREME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,SIMPLY SUPREME?,"I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THESE GIRLS GET THE COURGAGE TO CALL THEMSELVS ""THE SUPREMES"". I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO"
1,Bootleg Copy of original DVD!,"This is a BOOTLEG COPY of the DVD, no menue and poorly done.NOTE: This is a BOOTLEG, not even worth being called a 'Pirated' copy, it is a BOOTLEG COPY. Do NOT be fooled by the seller telling you it is ""BRAND NEW & FACTORY SEALED"" for that is a LIE!!!!"
4,awesome book for power electronic design engineer,"I first saw this book in 1997, the second year after the first version of this book, when I was in my master's program in China. I didn't pay much attention to it since my future job will not involve high-power or high-voltage IC design. After I graduated from Univerity of Tennessee, I got a job offer from a semiconductor company and became an engineer to design products related to automotive electronics. Then,I bought this book for my job. This book was written by a group of very experienced engineers in ST microelectronics ten years ago. I was surprised this book is still very useful today. Part of the contents may be out of date, but most of the chapters were still used again and again in modern designs. I wish these authors can rewrite this book and include some new developments in both academic and industry. Overall, this is an awesome book for engieers who will start their careers in power electronics. I recommend it."
4,Old but good power IC book,Smart power ICs isn't a conventional DC/DC-converter control cook book. Instead it covers wide range problems/design issues that need to be considered when designing switching converter ICs.
1,horrible,omg this bag is horrible!! its way to big and a hassle to carry around i suggest u do not get this bag
5,Thinking About A Harrier? GET THIS BOOK!,"Harriers are a rare breed in the US, this book gives you lots of information about the dogs and contains some beautiful photographs! It covers what the breed's history is, what they are like to live with, how to care for them, and demonstrates the dog's abilities with information about harrier packs, agility, obedience, and therapy work. There is also information about the harrier's health concerns and what to look for when you purchase a harrier puppy. If you are thinking about a harrier, you NEED this book!"
3,"Not quite, deadly...","After reading this book, I found myself needing to ask more questions about the so-called deception. This book is not really tell all and may have been better if too much time wasn't spent on certain personal ventures. I never got the actual deception part and whether or not it is really deadly. I must say that there are a lot of facts, excerpts and explanations, but the exposure part kind of left me hanging. It is about one man's journey and success through freemasonry. It did not get down and dirty on the exposition of freemasonry."
4,Free Masonry,"Very informative, The story is very effective because the author begins from his boyhood and how that affected his decisions concerning mesonry."
3,"Unless we were there, we don't really know.","I have read the reviews about what masons n non masons have said about MR. Shaw's story. Other books n video's that have ex-masons tales as well as a mason that I know have verified some of the unflattering things that have been swirling around for years. However in all honesty I would have to say that if men of no integrity get into these positions of trust n enforce all of the negative stereotypes, that the decent masons have been trying to get shed of, then it is the duty of all decent masons to expel all of those who are men of despicable character who have no business in masonry so that all of the negative things that are said about masonry will be a thing of the past.W. FrazierShelbyville IN."
3,Great book on the tactics of Anti masons and their deception,"I give this book three stars only because it is a great study in the tactics of anti masons. The sad part is, that too many will read the book and accept it as truth, based upon the perceived quality of its sources. Too many people fail to do their own research and find the facts behind such perversions of the truth. If you must read this book please take the time to read A PILGRIMS PATH BY ROBINSON, FUNDAMENTALISM AND FREEMASONRY BY LEAZER, AND IS IT TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT FREEMASONRY ( A REBUTTAL TO DEADLY DECEPTION) BY MORRIS. You owe it to yourself to know the truth."
4,Credentials of author unimportant (in my opinion),"In my opinion, it matters not if Jim Shaw had the credentials he touted. What matters is the content. Is it true? Can it be verified? I believe it is and it can be. The excerpts taken from pages of Mason literature as compared to what the Bible teaches make it clear that Free Masonry and authentic Christianity are incompatible. I'm saddened when I see the ""Christian fish"" and the Masonic emblem on the back of the same vehicle. I DO NOT HATE those who embrace Free Masonry, they too were created in the image of God and we as Christians should love them pray that the veil of deception be lifted so they may see the truth. The book does an excellent job at comparing what Masonic doctrine says versus what the Bible teaches. The content is easily verifiable by accessing Free Masonry literature. More could be said, but this is supposed to be a book review, not a lesson in Christian apologetics."
4,"cool picture, bad mug","the picture on the outside is coll, but the mug stinks, it keeps your drink hot for a while but then the top spills when bumped, but i would recommend this item if you have coffe, ECT every morning and you have to leave early. The top that spills, spills onto the topbut then drains back into the mug and it doenst spill anywhere else. So if you like the nighmare b4 xmas, and you drink coffee on the go every morning, get this....cheap too!!!"
5,a fantasic examination of one slice of race history,"William Ivy Hair in this fast-paced, readable book accomplishes more in a couple of hundred pages than many of our more ponderous historians have aimed to achieve in far-bulkier works. If future historians learn to write and marshall their facts as well as Hair does here, the tales of our past will remain vivid and important to young readers of the future."
3,Not a Box Set - Just 3 Previous Releases,"This is three previous releases in one package - Discovery, Face the Music & A New World Record. None of them say they are remastered. Discovery has the 3 extra tracks that are on the remastered version. The other 2 do not have the extra tracks on the remastered versions. My fault for just reading ""Box Set"" and not comparing the song listings to other CDs. Had I realized what this was, I would not have bought it. Good price if you don't want the remastered versions."
2,Not durable,"This looks pretty but isn't very durable. The teardrop portion of the keychain becomes unscrewed rather quickly. Once that's happens, you're more than likely to be left with just a ring and not a keychain."
2,It's better to buy materia medica revised edition,"This herbal medicine book is complicated.also letter is vague. some herbs in chinese character is wrong.book weight is so heavy, I would not recommend this book."
3,"Good, yet not Good","Pro: very comprehensive, good for those who need all the informationCon: very comprehensive, too much detail violates the spirit of Oriental Medicine"
2,"Good Information, but embarrassingly full of printing errors","While the information is excellent, there are so many printing errors that it is laughable. How could so many mistakes make it into publication, especially at the price charged? I hope future editions can rectify this seemingly easy problem, again before it sold as a product."
4,A great source of information,"This book is some loaded with great information, I learn something every time I pick it up. Well written, easy to understand."
2,Chinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica,"too cumbersome for reference, would be better if offered in 3 volumes. Also, color pics should accompany the text to guide the reader."
3,unimpressed,"This book was on my wish list for a long time, I really wanted ONE materia medica to go in-depth and cover more than any one source. I was very disappointed, it covers LESS than other sources at twice the cost. I got more out of Fratkin's and Tierra's books than out of this book.It will just sit on my bookshelf to ""look good"". Definitely not a go-to book if you want to research more in-depth a particular herb."
3,you get what you pay for,"great tag to hang on the wall, but if you want to put it on your car, you better order a dozen of them. anything will dent this tag...ANYTHING... i have dents from BUGS!!!"
3,A well-trodden path for Bregovic,"This is a fine recording, but unless you're a hardcore Bregovic or Kayah fan, buy his Ederlezi CD instead and save your money -- it's almost all the same material, with slightly different arrangements. Bregovic has been shamelessly recycling the same batch of tunes for a while now, using a new singer from a different country each time to mask the sameness of it all -- now here's his Polish installment. Hey, Goran! Isn't it about time you wrote some new songs?Give Kayah her due -- she's got a wonderfully dark, fluid voice. The treat on this recording is Jesli Bóg Istnieje, but it's not new, either -- most of the melody is just a reworking of Ako Ima Boga, a song he did years ago with Bijelo Dugme. If you're unfamiliar with these performers, this CD is a nice place to start, but if you've heard any of Bregovic's recent recordings, you'll find this one covering ground that's all too familiar."
3,Kayah & Bregovic,"Was kind of disappointed. While the Polish folk songs were WONDERFUL and Kayah's voice excellent, most songs were simply reworkings of Bregovic's old pre 1985 songs. Those songs were MUCH better in the original format. Very little new material on this album. NOT recommended for long time Bregovic fans. However to new listeners. GO FOR IT!!! and if you like it, check out the original Bijelo Dugme albums (Bregovic's old band)"
3,"Kayah is great and so is Bregovic , so why it doesn't work ?","I think the music that Bregovic done at the movies is greatbut here with Kayah it sounds like something is missing.Kayah is great but it sounds like we've heard it before andit was even better , so what's the point doin it again ?For those who heard this music for the first time i guess itsounds great but i reckon you should go for the 'real thing',the music of Bregovic as it's at the movies or Kayas solo albums."
2,don't do it,"These sandals are fun to wear, in fact, you may have a hard time prying them away from the wearer. The sensation of those nodules poking into your soles can be addictive. HOWEVER, your soles will harden as if you'd been trekking barefoot in the Outback for generations."
5,The Princess Grows a Garden,Princess Chamomile may be a princess but she doesn't mind getting dirty! Princess Chamomile and Milchoir (the gardener) plant a garden designed by the Princess. It takes a long time to create the garden - but it is worth the wait. This book is great for readers from 7 years and up and is a great book for all people interested in gardens and princesses! My favorite part of the story is when Princess Chamomile admits that she didn't play the piano well because she was day-dreaming. Knowing that someone else feels that way may let kids understand that a little whimsey instead of perfection is perfectly okay. It is also a good story to teach patience - and that good things take a while to come true. The illustrations are perky and fit the charm of the story. This is a delightful book and a good way to get students back into the swing of reading for this school year.
3,I was Mike Mendoza,"Wonder what happened to my band mates. I lived in Dixon and Liberty Farms. Andy and I played guitar together ofter and eddy would just not turn down that base. Remember Playing at the Dixon May Fair and George playing the NBC three note theme at Dixon Unified High School. Memorial Auditorium where the Beach Boys Played, cost $2.50 for a ticket."
1,Simpson's forensic medicine,It is very well presented and good quality and it consists of details with diagrams . I like to read the latest version of it when i get it.
4,The 60's are Still Alive!,"Barry Melton was the Fish in Country Joe and The Fish. Barry has maintained his skills and if anything improved his guitar playing. This is a live recording and a good idea of what he's up to today. As Far As The Title: ""The Saloon Years"", is ironic as he still plays The Saloon in San Francisco. The Saloon, a survivor of the 1906 earthquake, is the oldest standing Bar in San Francisco, a Blues Venue for the last 40 years that I know of Supported by some of the best players, Charlie Mussellwhite, Nick Gravenites, Gino Skaggs, Barry ""The Fish, and countless others. A small bar, mostly standing room, hardly even known by local Blues lovers. Back to this CD, a must for the Woodstock Generation, Blues Lovers and beyond. If you see he is playing anywhere buy this CD, take it with you for an autograph and enjoy some great music. Or Buy the CD and enjoy it for many years to come."
3,Apron and chef hat,Process was pretty seamless. Received item in acceptable amount of time. Only problem was received item and one of the aprons had some sort of stain on the front of it. I took a picture of it but don't know how to upload it here.
3,One of the few books that should have been longer,"I read this short book in two sittings and I have to admit that it is one of the few books I wish was longer. The author has a real gift for storytelling and his simple use of words and language is refreshing. However, he does not flesh out the characters enough and leaves the reader feeling short-changed. The characters are all wonderful, but there is not enough of them! The ending was far too abrupt and left me with the feeling that the author stopped writing at the very point where he just started to draw me deeply into his story. Each character was so fascinating, but just not enough of them. Mr. Swanson is extremely talented and I wish he would have fleshed the book out more. Wait for it to come out in paperback and enjoy the quick read. Let me know if you agree that the book should be twice as long."
2,You can give it a pass,"It wanted to be a story, it really did. But the author somehow neglected to put together a coherent plot. Some of the writing is quite lyrical, but the retread plot points and miniscule character development prevents this from ever becoming more than a couple of hours with a fair book."
3,Bring me Some Strawberry Sauce.,"I'm not sure...It pretends to be a good book, I almost believed it, but I guess it's not. It kept my attention and made me wonder what was the mistery in it, but, at the end, I found out it was really no big deal. The story reveals itself as you expected since the beggining. It's as ordinary as it could be. Alcoholic parents, mysterious friends and all that stuff you read about before. Still, Swanson's narrative style is very soft and pleasant, in a gentle way. It's like a nice apple pie, but I rather have a big Banana Split with Strawberry Sauce and hot chocolate, for dessert."
5,Good things do come in small packages,"THE BOY IN THE LAKE is a graceful, yet powerfully moving novel that deals with lies, desire, violence and forgiveness. The power of this novel lies in the understated elegance and economy of the narrative. Simply written, the storyteller's voice is both subtle and seductive, drawing the reader quickly and completely into the story. While this book could so easily be passed over on a bookshelf, you would do yourself a favor by seeking it out."
4,"Simple to Read, Complex Ideas","This concept for this novel is simple, but the execution takes many different forms as the plot winds through. Christian Fowler is the main character who is searching for his past by trying to locate a former classmate and friend. After abruptly leaving his hometown in his youth, he returns to settle his grandmother's estate. It is during this time that Chris is weaving between the past and present in order to locate Reis Paley. He relives the painful past in being a friend to Reis, who was different from his other companions. He shares a bond with Reis that transcends time and that remains with him through adulthood. This novel will have to become one of my favorites. I especially enjoyed seeing the growth and maturity from Greenhouse Effect to this novel. Mr. Swanson has certainly brought a vast experience to this work."
5,Evocative and thought-provoking,Swanson's novel is a quick read -- but not quickly forgotten. Christian's search for absolution from both his childhood friend and from himself draws the reader in and takes him along on a journey of self-discovery. A deceptively simple trip home brings Christian full circle and face-to-face with the friend he betrayed 30 years before. I was involved with Christian and unable to put the book down until I had devoured it and internalized its message entirely. This is one book I expect to pick up time and again in order to discover new layers within.
4,"Emotional, well-done!","The emotional life of a gay therapist is told here with clarity and honesty. We come to understand his struggles with a particularly reclusive patient as well as the therapist's own ""first love."" Swanson has created memorable characters and a rich, detailed story. While he jumps back and forth between the protagonist's past and present, Swanson delivers his narrative without confusion. I would have prefered a straight forward narrative but Swanson's prose makes up for all the back and forth.Swanson's powers of observation and his meticulous attention to detail brings vividness and depth to the story and the characters. There is no explicit sex in the story which I was hoping for since the tension is certainly there. Well done! I look forward to more of Swanson's work."
2,Looks nice on screen...,"First off all, the towel rack I got in the mail and the one pictured are different, but as it WAS an over the door towel rack I didn't let that bother me too much. The item does, at least, function as a towel rack, but that's the end of it. When I tried to put it together 5 of the 6 screws fit just fine, the last one I actually had to widen the hole myself to make it fit. The bars have plastic end caps painted with a metallic paint which was scratched off and one was in 3 pieces. The frame is flimsy. When I put my first towel on one of the bottom hooks, the whole frame shifted downward a bit, as it it couldn't support the weight too well. The product in general is cheap and I would suggest spending a few extra dollars and buying quality."
5,GEIL MANN! Basis ist alles!,"This is one of the best CDs out on the market. I first heard it when, my friend and his host sister came back from Germany. And that's all that we listend to for like 3 months. It is qutie old now, but still, I like to get my CD out and jam to it now and then. It brings back the memories. I would highly sugest this CD for anyone. So what if it is not in English. It's the beat that counts mann! Give it a try!"
4,Text book for Spanish Class,"I needed this book for a Spanish class I am taking. It was in excellent condition when it arrived. The only thing was that I did not know that I had ordered the instructor's manual until it arrived. I thought I had the student book. I am certain the instructor's version will be fine, however, it has all of the answers so it will be more difficult for me to quiz myself.It would have been nice if the seller had noted that this book was an instructor's version. Other than that, I am prepared for class. I will be able to study efficeintly."
2,Made in China,"Was deeply disappointed to see these lamps are no longer made in the USA. I wanted to buy a well made light, but was scammed again. Am considering sending back"
4,Look like real old fashioned barn lights,"For a fraction of the cost. Just built a new gambrel style garage with metal roof and siding. Wanted to replicate that old barn light look. This was the only affordable option. They went up easy and seem very well made. Can't yet vouch for durability, but they seem like the real thing. Recommend."
3,NOT MADE IN USA,"This item seems to be of ok quality but the item description is not correct and is misleading, this item is NOT made in the USA...IT IS CHINA MANUFACTURED..."
4,Great Introductory Commentary for Serious Students,"Michael Green has done a thorough and yet relatively simple work in this commentary on these sometimes overlooked epistles. It follows closely with Richard Bauckham's exegesis which I consider to be THE standard for study on this work. Unlike Bauckham's work, Green is not steeped so much into the Greek, which may be too hard for the more novice student to digest. Green also does an ample job to support his belief that Apostle Peter is indeed the author of this epistle, which unfortunatley is something Bauckham does not adhere to.I do find it strange that Mr. Green often quotes Calvin for support of his views, but Green's conclusions are decidely Arminian, which is a bigger paradox than that of Green's speculation on election and free-will. Nevertheless, it's a worth-while read and great for pastors and a very nice companion to Richard Baukham's work."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst condoms I have used.1) According to condoms.com these are 8"" in length, but this is incorrect. I tried three of these, and each was at most 5"". Just over half of my length was covered, which is not so good.2) The resorvoir tip has a nasty habit of sucking in the lip of my urethra, which looks absolutely horribly and isn't real pleasant. You need to pinch more than the tip to avoid this occuring.3) The first condom would not unroll correctly without fiddling with it - part of the condom was tucked into the roll.4) The third condom broke, badly. When I looked at it afterwards my penis looked like a worm with that wider bit at the center.Absolutely horrible condom, do not buy this."
3,A good book to start your search!,This book does a great job at letting you know where the Hotels with character are in Paris and hepls you uncovere some hidden gems. It's colorful map makes it very easy to shop around for hotels based on location. The index in the back also helps you find the best values for the dollar. Each hotel has a nice sized color picture and an up to date description of about 150 words. I found the descriptions to be a bit limited and somewhat repetitive. The writers seemed to be very focused on noise levels and do not offer much information on service and cleanliness. Overall a good book especially if you are going to use it in conjunction with another source.
3,Very Very Elementary,"I'm giving this book 3 stars because its cover is misleading. The majority of the book is about starting a business - any business. It also fails to adequately address law. For example, non payment is prevalent in contracting. But the book doesn't mention bond agents, licenses, waivers, releases, etc.If you are looking to tighten your operation, learn more about a specific topic or ensure collection, this is not the right book."
2,Contractor,"For beginners only. Written as if you don't know anything about the business, so if you don't then buy it. It will not open your eyes to anything new if you're in the business."
4,Smart Business for Contractors,"Good solid information on the accounting, legal and business details of a construction company."
5,You don't need a stinking book!!,Ah. Finally a foreign language program that marries price and value with common sense. Did you wander around learning your native language with a book and vocabulary and grammar. NO!! You spoke it and repeated it and tried new words and phrases!! Pimsleur has it right. Audio only please from now on. I'm going to try the other Pimsleur languages just for fun.
4,One of the best albums of mid 80's Euro-disco,"Just a great disco album. I mark this album among the best Euro-disco albums (1984-87) by Modern Talking, C.C.Catch, Joy, Savage. Personally I think that some songs on this album sound much more talented than some Dieter Bohlen hits. Thanks Amazon.com for having this item."
3,Strange and Wonderful,"Novalis' incomplete novel, Heinrich von Ofterdingen, is characteristic of this great poet/thinker's fascination with nature, poesy, and myth. Although the Marchen of this text are rather hackneyed, there are nevertheless remarkable reflections on the nature of poetic creation in this peculiar text. There are plenty who cite this as Novalis' finest literary achievement, but I will easily take his Hymns to the Night as well as the Novices of Sais both in terms of the creative synthesis of ideas and beauty of their form. However, it is in Heinrich, that we get a glimpse at some of Novalis' more cryptic fascinations with Christian and Middle Age myth."
2,A book that should not be forced upon anyone,"In my class at college, we had to read this book. The imagery and fairy tale qualities imply that under other circumstances I would enjoy reading this story. However, the book is hardly a masterpiece of literature, the pacing is impossible, the writing apart from the poetry is tedious and dull. the story winds an runs on and on and though the concepts are quite thought provoking when discussed with others who actually understand and follow this dribble, when reading it, it zaps the mind of any thought."
3,Really mediocre,This entire series is only mediocre. That's all I can say about it. The characters are mediocre (though some of the smaller parts are actually good) and the story lines are mediocre. Not a lot of anything really happens.
2,Curse The Dark,"Just when Wren Valere's relationship with Sergei is definable as such, it looks like they might be parted by a secret order called the Silence, who at one time protected them. No matter what the Silence wants, Wren and Sergei need each other to complete their mission to Italy. Moreover, they have demons, trackers, and assorted other problems to deal with in addition to finding a dangerousd artifact and handling the Silence.** If you want an action packed, hyper paced read, then this is what you are in the market for; however, the light character development will fail to engage readers for whom that is important. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Way too confusing,"This book was initially interesting, but she added the conspiracy level. Suddenly, it became confusing, everything was left open. Who was the bad guy, who was the good guy, why should we care what happened to any of these people? I didn't care about the mystery either. The only person I wanted to learn more about was Sergii (the hero). I felt she short changed him and the heroine was way over developed. Don't waste your money on this. Borrow it from a friend or read it at the library!"
4,Great read for a first time author......................,"I just happened to find this book at my local book store and what a great read. I could'nt find the first book of this series,but Laura blended both books so well together that I felt that I diddn't miss anything. Sergie and Wren are so great together that it was a joy just to see their reactions together. Also enjoyed how the electric current worked so well with the magic. Will have to someday pick up Staying Dead,but eagerly awaiting the next Retriever Novel. I highly recommend this series if you enjoy Jim Butcher,and Laurell K.Hamilton. Enjoyed it Laura,hurry up and finish the next book."
3,Disappointing after the first one,"I really enjoyed ""Staying Dead."" ""Curse the Dark"" was much more fractured and confusing. The story isn't nearly as intense, and the actions of the characters didn't make as much sense. It seems as though not much really happened until the end of the story.""Staying Dead"" grabbed me from the first pages. ""Curse the Dark"" felt like an obligatory read. I had read the first one, therefore, I had to read the second. It wasn't from enjoyment that I finished it. There wasn't any true ""whodunit"" that had to be solved, and the climax wasn't satisfying to me.I enjoy Laura Anne Gilman's writing style, and so will look for the third story. I know this author can write a really good story, since she's proven it in the debut novel. I hope she finds that same spark for the third in the series."
2,Just didn't keep my interest.,"I read Laura Anne Gilman's ""Staying Dead"", the first book in the Retriever series, and wasn't very impressed. Laura Anne Gilman tried to create a new world of magic, but she made it way too complicated. There was so much time spent just trying to describe and explain the many different intricacies of her characters' world, that the flow of the book suffered. It was a difficult read. I went ahead and started ""Curse the Dark"", because I was hoping that, having gotten most of the explanations and descriptions of her world out of the way in the first book, she could settle down to concentrate on plot. It was actually a more difficult read than the first book, and, I'm sorry to say, I could not bring myself to finish the second book. It was more work than enjoyment to read."
5,Awesome,Great resource. Great research. Much thanks to David for putting this together for us. I really love these books. Thanks David.
1,I would pass on it,"I bought it based on reviews; had it with me in Utah; and did not find it useful. It may work for someone planning to ONLY drive around Utah with a lot of time. But if you kind of know where you are going, there are large distances between places and either you will drive by something cool or not."
4,size is off,I wear a medium in most things but i ordered a large so i could were layers under the pants. But they were so big they wouldn't even stay up i could have fit 2 of me in them. Not even sure if a medium would have fit. But the company I ordered them from was really great to work with during my return. Great after the sell customer service. They were great snow pants especially for the price. Just make sure you order smaller then your true size.
3,Cargo Snow Pants,"I purchased these snow pants to just play in the snow with my children. They look nice and worked great for the price. They stayed dry and I stayed warm. I normaly buy mediums in everything (pj,sweats,leggings,tights) So I bought the medium snow pants. They were a little to big for me even with the tights underneath. There is a lot of room in the seat and expandable waist. A size small would have been a better fit for me. Over all they served thier purpose, kept me dry and warm. They get three stars just because of the fit."
2,Very disappointed with the sizing,"Like many of the other reviews, I had the same problem with the sizing. I originally purchased these at a local store and bought a size M; too small so I took back to get an L but they didn't have them so I ordered them through Amazon. These are absolutely huge! Even pulling the velco tabs on the sizes all the way I still can't make them fit. If you are looking for snow pants that actually fit, DO NOT BUY THESE. Go spend more money and get a brand that is better quality. What a shame."
3,They are warm,"I bought these to walk my dog when it's really cold out. They do keep me warm, but they aren't very well made. The first time I put my hand in the front pocket, I found a hole in the seam. The snap above the zipper is attached to a piece of velcro. Because the velcro rises above the bottom of the snap, it won't close so you have to rely on the velcro, which isn't the best option because the zipper slides down easily. I ended up getting a pair of suspenders to make sure they stay up. They are okay for the price."
3,Comes in large size,"The ski pants feels warm, but I didn't really get to try it since it was too big to wear. I read the review from the others and ordered one size up, I usually wear size 4-6 depends on the maker, so ordered Medium for this. But it was too big. Falling off. Do not listen to the review saying to order larger size. It comes out big. So either to take your size for comfort or smaller for fit. Now I have to return it, even though, I like it. Good luck with your sizing."
5,Great Snowpants,"These snowpants are very well made and keeps one dry and warm. Even thought I read reviews about the sizing being off, I decided to get what I usually buy. I bought a Med. and they fit me perfectly with room to spare, and I'm a size 8 (they would fit someone size 10 just fine). There is elastic on the waistband and even a velcro part to make them tighter at the waist if needed, a plastic loop to attach D rings, and it also has 4 pockets (two higher inset pockets with zippers and 2 on the thigh with velcro), which come in handy when I'm outside with the kids (tissues and bandaids in one pocket, used tissues in another, and keys/cell phone in another)."
2,falls short,"Based on the reviews, I thought that this book would be a good addition to a child's home library. However, I was disappointed in this story. It wanted to offer a positive message but what I took from it was that you need to do things exceptionally in order to impress others and show up your tormentors. So what's a kid to do if they can't, since that would be the case for most kids. I didn't find this book empowering at all. In fact, if I was a kid looking for inspiration, I would feel pretty poorly after looking for it in this book."
3,philip review of stand tall molly lou melon,"This story is about a girl named Molly. She moved to a new town and started a new school. And a boy picked on her but soon nobody picked on her because she had talent.The author's message is accepting other differences because accepted how she was better then them.This book is similar to tacky the penguin because the authors messages is the same in tacky the penguin you can learn accepting other differences.Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon was okay but if you are that kind of people that like weird stories about weird people then I would recommend this story to you. I live in Killingly, CT, USA. I am 8 years old.`"
4,good read aloud,I bought this book to read to my third grade students. The students could identify the author's message and the genre. It could be used to start a discussion about being proud of who you are and not letting other's opinions shape the way you see yourself. The students also really enjoyed the illustrations.
4,Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon,Short or tall we all have our talents. The main character of Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon is a young girl who is very short and has buck teeth. She gets made fun of by some kids at her school. She tells her grandmother about these kids. Her grandmother tells her to stand proud and show them what you can do. I really liked this book because it lets you know that even though you're not perfect you still have many talents. Even though it's a children's book I think anyone could read this book and learn something from it.
5,An excellent book about self esteem,I am always on the lookout for books that have a story that captivates me but is still simple enough for my two year old daughter to follow. This book fits the bill nicely. My daughter will sit still through a reading and you cannot help but embrace the message within this book that we are all special. This is the first book I have found that deals with the issue of self esteem. I think it will be invaluable to my daughter when she starts school.
5,"Stand tall, Molly Lou Melon",Great book for teaching to celebrate differences and unique qualities. Tell your children how wonderful they are and they will believe it!
5,"Stand Tall, Moly Lou Melon","As a 2nd grade teacher, I loved to read this book to my students. They love it! It is a wonderful book for children to hear that you should be proud of who you are. I love the illustrations too!"
4,Great Children's Book,I thought that Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon was an excellent story for young and old readers alike. I think most people can relate to Molly Lou Melon's character. The theme of always being yourself is prevelant and I think that is very important for young readers. The pictures throughout the story really draw the reader into Molly Lou Melon. I think Molly Lou Melon is a great story and should be read by all!!
5,LOOOOOVE IT!,"I was looking for books illustrated by David Catrow because I think they are interesting... That is how I came across this book & borrowed it from the library. My 17 month old wants me to read it to her before bed every night, and I can not say no because it is truely a wonderful little book. We still have the library copy, but intend to buy our own copy with our next amazon purchase. GREAT message accompanied by interesting illustrations. High on my/our list of favorites. RECOMMENDED!!!"
5,Very nice,I gave it to my mom for mother's day. She loved it. The necklace is beautiful and I was happy to find it since most of the box necklaces are religiously associated(and we're not). It's a very different looking piece of jewelry and the shipping was right on time. However..I keep reviewing this product and Amazon keeps asking me to do it again...WHY!
3,"Interesting subjects, but probably not good for a primary text","I recently used this book as a primary text in a graduate statistical mechanics course and I cannot recommend it for this purpose. I like the ""spirit"" of the book, but it was frustrating in several ways. Many of the derivations leave out non-trivial steps. I often found it necessary to refer to other texts and resources (e.g. Pathria's text), where similar material is covered more clearly. Beyond the first few chapters, there could be a better selection of problems. The chapters are quite dense with material, but there are not always corresponding problems. I had some reservations in choosing this text, but there are not many up-to-date graduate texts to choose from. Pathria is about the right level, but a bit too verbose, slow-moving, and dated."
2,Not Good on RG,I read the chapter on Renormalization Group but actually the mathematical derivation is vague. The author seems just want to keep the beautiful format of formula and lost the readability.
2,"Sorry, but this CD stank","My rating is actually 2.5 stars, but I can't really do .5. Anyways, I really don't want to say this but this album was just plain bad. I heard the songs ""Hundred Million"" and ""American Psycho"" and decided to buy it even though ""American Psycho"" wasn't on it. The only good songs are probably ""Ideal Waste of Time"", ""Don't Believe it All"" and ""Hundred Million."" Other than that this CD stank. Sorry to be so blunt but it did. The first time I listened to it it was alright but after a few times it just got so boring. Their's no point in buying this CD for just a few songs so I don't suggest."
1,Wrong songs!,I ordered this album and none of the songs that are listed in the list of tracts are the same. It was all different songs. Watch out for that if you order it.
5,Boa Sina,"Boa Sina was Alan Silva's first album, released in 2004. It is a really good trilogy. I was surprised when I heard it, for the first time, just how good it really was. If you're a fan of Alan Silva's folk stuff in Big Green Country or Aviary Tomb, this is a good one. Plus, it's three discs in one."
3,Bought to fix up my dryer..,"I had nothing there to hook my dryer to there was just a hole in the wall, so i bought this.. it was a little big. I found a way to fix the problem. (My house is old)"
2,Not good book!,"The book is not good in my opinion. The font size of writing is small and quality of pictures is not good. Sometimes, it is not easy to understand about what the author is talking. Some english sentences of the author are not gramatically correct and hence it makes difficult to understand the material. The steps in profs of theorems and lemmas are skipped. In summary, I do not suggest anybody to buy this book. Try other books on this subject."
5,A boatload of new reasons to get up in the morning,"As our working lives increasingly encroach on our home lives, we've come to expect more from our jobs than a paycheck. Like Tom Peters, Granville Toogood inspires us to slough off the cynicism of Dilbert and embrace real creativity in the workplace.Chapter 7, ""The Four Fundamentals of Professional Fulfillment,"" could serve as the manifesto of a business revolution; it's alone worth the price of the book. But the book offers much more than a call to action -- it also gives practical examples from the lives of some of today's (and yesterday's) most innovative leaders: Steve Jobs, Andy Grove, Charlotte Beers, Martha Stewart, Walt Disney.As Mr. Toogood exhorts us: ""Forget the status quo. Way up and way out. Find some other way to go."" This book may not take you there, but it'll get you pointed in the right direction."
4,Beatles 101,"This book describes the earthshaking phenomenon of Beatlemania and the banner Year of the Beatles, 1964 when the band arrived in America. Extensive coverage of the Beatles' 1964 appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show is given as well as the background of each Beatle. The pre-Ringo years in Hamburg (1960-62) also receive fairly good coverage. Although this book offers nothing new to inveterate fans, people just coming into the Beatles will undoubtedly find this book to be a good teaching tool."
2,Died after exactly 1 year.,The EZDigiMagic drive worked great until the month the warranty was up. It crashed and now it's useless. I am disappointed that it only lasted exactly as long as the 1 year warranty. I would not buy it again.
3,Traditional,The Cross-Country Primer targets the beginner or less athletic skier. Nice layout and simple explainations reasonably priced. Avid or strong skiers might want to keep looking.
3,For the casual skier,The primer is more aptly named 'introduction to the sport of nordic skiing' because it focuses on the need of those starting out. The technical content is not nearly rigorous enough for a sport or racer class of skier.
5,Great for younger players,"I bought this game along with my children's first game system, a Gameboy Advance SP. Their ages are 3, 5, and 6. Each of them LOVES this game. Dora's character never dies, you just get set back slightly in the game which is perfect for starters.The levels do get progressively harder which has kept my 6-year-old interested while my 3-year-old plays the first level over and over."
4,Little Ones Beware,"I did my homework and read the reviews others wrote about Dora Explorer - The Search for Pirates Pig Treasure. I must say they were right on! When I brought the game home for by just turned 5 year old son his comment was - That's a baby game! We sat down and I explained that if he could get past the 5th or 6th level I would buy him a better game. He has been enthralled ever since! It's not a macho boys game. There is no killing, hitting, or weird characters. It's a simple game that a 5 year old can master with limited help from Mom and Dad! Buy this one for your younger child and don't worry about the ""image"". Oh, my 8 year old daughter keeps trying to ""borrow"" it as well."
4,Great Fun,"My six year old son is a little hesitant to play games with ""bad guys"" and first thought the flying bats, alligators and crabs were scary. But once we found out he could simply make Dora crawl passed the bats and hop over the others, he was very happy about the game.This game is just right for young kids because it has some challenges which aren't too difficult; and the automatic saves of each game level gives kids the opportunity to play the various levels over at any time. One added bonus about the save codes is that kids can draw the different images for each saved level and input the codes by themselves.My son did need help occasionally when he had to find certain items, but, overall, he didn't need much help. As my son would say, the game is great fun."
4,My Son loves this game!,"I got this game for my Son because he is a huge fan of Dora. So far he loves it, it does require passwords for each completed level but my Son just re-does the level because the passwords don't get writen down. This game is more for younger children as it is pretty easy to play(my Son is 3 and a half and can do most of the things himself). Overall I think this game is good for young fans of Dora :)"
5,The BEST book in the series!,"Ax, the Andalite from The Message, wants to go back to his home. So, he must build a Yeerk distress transponder, and putting that together sents them morphing from lobsters to ants. When the ship lands, they try to attack it, but they fail, and are taken into outerspace, and they meet Visser One. Marco's mother"
5,a good book,I liked how the characters turned into lobsters and almost were cooked. This book has everything. It is funny and adventurous.
1,">,<","I love hot chocolate. I stir in a bit of coffee creamer in various flavors so I don't have to buy the expensive stuff. My mom orders 5 lb bars of chocolate from this company to make home-made chocolates every Christmas, so I thought, 'hot cocoa? really? that's awesome!' I bought a few tins and tried them out. First cup was nasty. I added more. Still nasty. More! Still nasty! So I added less. Even more nasty. I don't know if the product is too sweet or bitter, or what say you, but it was 100% disgusting and I couldn't finish even 1/3 of my mug. I even tried adding creamer in copious amounts, sugar in various amounts, making it with milk, soy milk, water, in the microwave, on the stove, mixed with various flavorings and extracts and have come to the conclusion that there is no way to make this product palatable."
4,Ghirardelli Chocolate Hot Chocolate Mix - Double Chocolate,"Very delicious, deep chocolate flavor with about half a table spoon of mix. I especially like mixing it with almond milk."
2,not sweet enough,I thought the hot choc. mix was not very sweet and didn't like it. So unless you like you choc. a bit unsweet then don't get it.
3,"too sweet, but there's a cure.","No,this isn't the ""old fashioned"" cocoa mix, there's just too much sugar in it. However, you can buy unsweetened cocoa in bulk and mix it in 50/50 and now you're getting a real hot chocolate. Of course, you can adjust the ratios to taste, 50/50 is kind of hardcore.Ghiradelli, you're not doing America any favors by making this product so sweet."
5,absolutely the best hot cocoa mix,"The ingredients in the major brands of store-bought hot cocoa mix are alarming. They don't taste good either. I don't like to think that I actually used to drink the stuff. The Ghirardelli hot cocoa mix is not at all like that nasty sweet stuff. It is just so good! It doesn't have any disgusting ingredients. Of course it is not a low-calorie food, but it's quite good made with whatever level of reduced-fat milk you are accustomed to, and if you mix part cocoa and part coffee, that saves on calories, too. Because it is made with high-quality Ghirardelli cocoa, it tastes even better than mom used to make (my mom didn't have access to gourmet cocoa powder). If you buy this product, you will not be disappointed. It would be nice if this mix was also available in single-serving envelopes."
1,Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Great Service Terrible Product,I received the product promptly. The problem is that there was something wrong with the hot chocolate mix. It had a horrible taste. I purchased the exact same one a couple of months ago from a dealer from Amazon and it was wonderful. This purchase was a disappointment. The delivery and all was wonderful but the product seemed stale and just terrible.
5,STUDIO ALBUM,"It might sound like a greatest hits album but it's not, it's a new studio album from Warrant and it rocks. Features 3 new original songs: ""Jones"", ""Southern Comfort"" and ""Bad Tattoo"" and 9 newly recorded versions of previous Warrant songs. Heaven '99' and I Saw Red '99 are almost better then the original versions. Also as a bonus there are 4 cover songs.Not sure why some people are upset that most of the songs are redone versions, because they also complain about to many compilation albums, and at least this album offers something new.This album is the import version of the ""Greatest & Latest"" album, exactly the same except the 4 bonus tracks of remixes are replaced with 4 cover songs instead."
3,Flavor not the best,"Honey-lemon is yucky. My friend ordered peach and it is tastier. It works OK but not a miracle worker. Does cut some of the ""frogs""."
3,It's OK I guess,"I'm the lead singer of a band and have used this a few times but I often think I'm better off without it. As per online advice, when I spray this into my throat I inhale slightly, so that it goes deep into the vocal chords and moistens them, but it seems to burn my throat a little and even causes phelgm in some occasions. There have been a few times I had a cold and a sore throat and this seemed to help a little, but under normal circumstances it can cause some irritation, so I'm not sure what to think of this product. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it makes things worse. After a year of use, I can't decide if I like or dislike it. I've tried Vocal Eze as well and I get the same results."
5,Clear Voice Vocal Spray Product Description:,"1 Honey-Lemon Flavor Bottle = 1.01 fl. oz. (30 ml):Clear Voice is an innovative blend of herbs designed to keep your airways open and your mouth and throat moist. Gaining acclaim nationwide, Clear Voice is rapidly becoming a must have for those who depend on their voice to be powerful and clear. Whether you are a performer or spend your days in the lecture hall, Clear Voice can offer relief from fatigue, dry and scratchy throat, and even soothing vocal cords when you are sick."
5,Great Knife,"Well designed, balanced bread knife at a fraction of the cost of other knives. American Test Kitchen was right in selecting it as highly recommended!"
5,Big Ol' Slicer,"I got this thing for filleting salmon last summer. Forget the little fillet knives, they suck. This big ol' roast beef knife carves a big ol' thick skinned Sockeye like it's made out of butter. I lost it behind the stove in a hotel room and it was wedged back there where I couldn't get at it. Thankfully, I have a little bit of MacGyver in my genes and fashioned a magnetic fishing pole out of shoelaces and kitchen magnets. I did of course cut myself pretty good with it. It's a sharp one - and because it has a Granton edge, it's sharpenable... is that a word? GREAT CUTTER. Probably too big for most jobs, but I use it for everything - bread, meat, tomatoes."
1,Won't hold edge,"Bought two of these for my chefs at the Restaurant.They tell me the knife will not hold a sharp edge for long. In just two months they are pretty much shot.Will be going back to our previous, Henkel, though more expensive, worth the price."
4,Almost Perfect,This knife was exactly described. From the quality and feel to the amount of flex in the blade. I was able to put a razor edge on the knife and keep it with minimal steel work.From a personal point of view I think that I would prefer a slightly stiffer blade.
4,Love it,I bought it for a friend as a birthday gift and he loving it. Even tho David (China) is a great chef but he never had this knife before. After using it he loves it because it's cutting meat like butter. Great and quality product.
4,Fabulous knife for carving turkey,"I enjoy good knives. I throw away those that just don't cut it (pun intended). This one's a keeper. Uniquely designed, it is very long to be able to stretch across the whole breast of a turkey and cuts perfectly. It is a thin design, making it less bulky to hold. I've had knives that hold onto whatever it cuts, but this one easily lets go of whatever it slices. However, on meats that are less dense, ie pot roast, it didn't do as well... but what knife does? Let me know! It's pricey, but this one will be around our holiday tables forever."
4,"Worked great at Thanksgiving, will use at Christmas",Very sharp but easy to handle. Worth the money certainly. My brother thought it was the best knife and he worked in. Sandwich shop for a while.
5,Ultimate Slicing Knife,"Great for slicing Turkey, Pork Roast, or Beef Roast. Slices are thin and consistent. This the best slicing knife I have ever used."
3,Nothing special,"The stellar reviews of this knife gave me high expectations. It is very sharp, which I would expect of any decent brand new knife. However, it did not slice through a tough piece of beef any better than my other sharp knives. I (carefully) tried it on a finger but it did not break skin. It is very large (as described) so it could be useful for a huge roasted turkey or ham. It takes a great deal of cleared counter space for sawing back and forth. Yes, I did need to ""saw"" with it. Because of its size it will be good for cutting a large watermelon, pumpkin or squash and also sawing through those tough, unopenable plastic packages that some items (such as this one) still come in. I'm not going to pay shipping to send it back (it was my mistake, not Amazon's)but I doubt I will use it often."
5,Good Slicing Knife,"I originally added this item to my wish list as I needed a new slicing knife for my adventures in BBQ. This knife is solidly constructed, and makes short work of pretty much anything that is tossed in front of it."
5,BIG Knife,When you want to cut up big meat it takes a big blade. I most often use this knife when I purchase a whole boneless beef rib. When I can cut my own steaks I can get thin when I want thin and thick when I want thick. But most of all I do not have to put up with steaks that are cut at a slnt through the thickness. when the thickness is the same through the steak it is much easier to cut to the desired doneness. uneven slice from the grocer are always either over cooked on the thin end or under cooked on the the thick. This knife is as expected also great for slicing roasts
5,Great Knife..great deal,"This is a remarkably good knife for the price. Much bigger than I expected, but it is wonderful for carving large cuts of meat or whole turkey. Cuts through those things like butter.."
4,great slicing knife,"This knife is easy to use and enables me to get nice thin slices from my roasts. Wish it came with a blade guard, but I think I can order one separately. This is a nice all around knife, long enough at 12"" to slice through just about any piece of meat, but not so long I'm poking through to the other size of the meat board! It's a nice mid-range price and quality, and I love the granton edge."
5,EXTREMELY SHARP,"OMG!! this knife is freaky sharp... please be careful... since the knife is long, it wouldn't fit in my pull-out drawer, so i have to store it in a bottom cabinet w/ my pizza knife... well, i was re-arranging the cabinet and didn't realize my thumb was close to the knife... you got it... it reached out and grabbed the tip of my thumb... i was afraid to look... i haven't had a chance to use it, per se, but it WILL cut extremely thin slices, just as i had hoped... the tip of my thumb is healing well... ENJOY!update: 2/26/11... FYI... as i recall, the knife i purchased was around $40 w/free shipping, not $68 plus shipping..."
5,Get ready to do some slicing!,Works just as expected. Great knife that has become my go to for any meat that needs to be sliced well!
5,cuts like a dream,The knife is a wonderful knife. I recommend to anyone looking to easily cut meat without it sticking.
2,"Knife Dull, Box Opened! Probably Floor Model!",Title says it all! This was a floor model that was slid back into the plastic container through a small slot at the top.
5,You need this knife!,This knife is awesome. The length is key for cutting through large loaves of bread. It's easy to control when cutting. Highly recommended!!
4,"I loved it until I ruined it, so I bought another one.","Others have already said it...It cuts paper thin slices of pretty much anything. The 12 inch blade is a big plus, allowing me to properly carve anything in a single slice. Sharp enough to send you to the hospital. I owned one of these for 3 years, and it finally needed sharpening so I decided to do it myself. Oops. I may know how to sharpen my chef's knife and my santoku, but I have no idea what I am doing with serrated blades. Obviously.So... I just bought another one and will quietly discard the one I destroyed this week. Then we will never speak of it again."
5,The slicer you are looking for,This is exactly the knife I was looking for. I have recently been smoking larger cuts of meat and needed a proper tool for slicing them. This slicer makes short work of a brisket in single strokes. Extremely sharp right out of the box. I expect with practice to be able to get slices with just one side. Thanks to all the other reviewers who rated this knife so highly!
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I was pleasantly surprised with this album. I heard ""Come Along"" on the Providence album and took a chance. Titiyo has a powerful voice and songs, which speak to the soul. Come Along is great as is 1989, Love Has Left Your Heart, My Heart Won and Right or Wrong. Powerful voice and lyrics - this is one of my favorites."
3,"Couple of nice tunes, lyrics not so hot","After listening to the CD a number of times I find it has some value. I can't give it 5 start just because I find there is not as many 'GREAT' tunes there. My favorite ones: Come Along, Love has left your eye, Last time. One problem I find with this CD should be probably attributed to my expectations. I really wanted more mature lyrics then what is acutally there. After listening to artists like Tori Amos, Jewel (not just her pop stuff) and Dido (ok, maybe she is more pop then Tori) it is little hard to get used to more ""fluffy"" music. In her defence she is a new commer and I hope for growth and development of her own style in the next CD. Overall, the songs I find interesting do justify my choice to buy the CD."
1,fulgar language at the utmost,"I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes. I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff. I put the video in my recycle box. Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minutes"
5,someone in MA,This is one of my favorite movies of all times... i hope to see more from William Roth in the near future!
1,pointless,"I think my title says it all. It was directionless and pointless. The only character that elicited any sympathy at all was Doug, and even he seemed to be drifting without any purpose. Even the gay issue failed to elicit any tension between the characters. I kept wondering when the plot would start, but it didn't"
1,Vanity Press,"For all of you poets who are in this book I just want to let you know this book is what is called a ""vanity press"". I bet you entered your poems on to poetry.com and then got a semi-finallist letter in the mail, everyone who enters poetry does. Unfortunely only the good poets fall into their trap and buy the books thinking they are true elite poets.I was tricked by them. Some of you most likely are top-notch poets, but poetry.com is a scam. Vanity press publishers publish anyone for money. They use flatery to get you to buy their books. This is not at all illeagal. Their is nothing wrong with vanity press, but I just thought you would like to know the truth. Please fellow poets, Keep Writing."
2,Weak on realness - strong on overview,"This book provides a great overview of all the different ways a DJ can position him/herself in the marketplace. Of course, they leave out the newest opportunities like retail stores, cafes, and restaurants and instead concetrate a lot on being a mobile DJ for parties and weddings. You're way better off getting a book that specializes in one type of DJing and spending your time and money pursuing that."
3,"get this book if you have no idea, but others wait out...","This guide isn't too bad, in fact it's pretty good for someone starting out and for those DJ.'s that might be out of the game for a while. If you're already ""in the groove"" so to speak, then it basically tells you what you already know. ie how to beat mix, read a crowd etc. I've bought his other titles as well (""make some noise"" and ""the ultimate guide""). But get this one first and save your cash. Speaking of which, this is expensive for an A4 style ""handout"". I mean some hardcover books sell for less. Chuck should collate several of his books together as I've forked out a lot for three guides.....You be the judge"
5,A great read! An insider perspective of Zia&#65533;s year in power,"Gen (retd) Khalid Mehmud Arif, in his book ""Working with Zia"" provides a unique look into Pakistani politics during the eight-year rule of Gen. Zia ul Haq.Being the Vice-chief of Army Staff - the author worked very closely with Gen Zia and got first hand knowledge of behind the scene politics.The author shed light on various aspects of Zia years from hanging of Mr. Bhutto to Afghan jihad and Pakistan's own internal and external struggle for survival.It's a good read especially to see how few people can change the course of whole country."
4,Good,"Good quality spoons. Too small to use in a mug though. Also they get hot very quickly, so don't leave them in hot tea"
4,a bit small,They are just fine. But a little too small -- if I put it in a mug it barely sticks out.
5,Well pleased,This product was exactly what I needed to accompany client's tea service. They are the perfect size. The product was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly.
3,If you're an audiophile...this model is definately not for you!,"I am a musician and have been running sound boards for over 10 years. I say that to try and qualify myself as having at least a decent ear for sound quality. I am a new subscriber to satellite radio and had hoped since it was a digital signal that the sound would be good, if not great. Mine has been neither. I can only speak for my unit, Starmate 4. I tried to avoid any static from the FM tranmitter so I wired it in to my receiver from the get-go. Many songs sound like a poor quality stream over the Internet, while some other songs on the same channel don't sound as bad. Typically the sounds is similar to a 98 kb/s rip or less on your computer. Hope your experience is better than mine."
1,Horrible unit - stay away,"I have 2 units, the sportster and an original starmate. They both have a wide FM transmitter range and excellent audio quality. The starmate had a screen issue so I got a replacement from Sirius - a starmate 4. Unbearable white noise made me wonder if this was a refurb. I called Sirius again and got another S4. The audio, while still having white noise, was not as bad. However, the FM transmitter range is about 2 feet. Yes, 2 feet, I only wish I was exaggerating. Now I have to call again and see what Sirius can do and exactly how they can stand behind this product. Very frustrating."
1,Buyer Beware of Rebates,"Buyer beware of advertised rebates. I purchased this unit during the holiday season intending to cash in on the $50 rebate that was shown (and linked to) on Amazon. After activating within the required time and submitting for the rebate I was informed that Amazon.com was not an eligible retailer for the rebate. This was stated in the fine print of the rebate, so ultimately it was my fault, however the blatant advertising of an unobtainable rebate by Amazon was severely misleading. Be sure to read the fine print...."
1,Not that great,"I had high hopes for this product, but ultimately it failed to live up to any of them. It looked nice and sturdy, and the pictures were very attractive, but it was neither. When I got it it had rough edges in need of sanding, and while heavy didn't appear to be all that well made. After less then 1 month of use, no pounding on it, no dishwasher, no leaving it in the sink, its broken already. I'm a good cook, I own lots of nice cooking equipment, I take good care of all of it but this board just didn't last. I always washed it quickly, dried it well, and stored it in a nice flat safe drawer with nothing banging into it. It still split in under 1 month. If you're looking for a cheese board this might be it, but it didn't stand up to average use in my household."
1,I agree with ehall23,"When I received this board, I was amazed at how heavy and sturdy it SEEMED to be. I oiled it before use, washed and dried it thoroughly immediately after use, and it split nearly in two in less than a month. ... . I generously oiled the replacement board and left it overnight before wiping it down and first usage. It began to split as well (I'd only had it for about 2-3 weeks). I NEVER put cutting boards in the dishwasher, always dry them thoroughly, and store them flat. I am very disappointed in this product and don't recommend it at all."
2,Varying quality?,"Maybe I'm not sous-chef enough for this cutting board, but from the varied reviews here I'd venture a guess that the quality of these boards is hit-or-miss. I have attempted to care for it and oil it, but it has warped and cracked -- still useable, but the handy groove for catching liquid doesn't work so well when everything dribbles down a crack.I noticed that my board is made up of small ""square-shaped"" wood pieces while the model on the site seems to be made of longer rectangular wood pieces. This could explain the difference."
4,WOW!,This Catskill Craftsmen Reversible Wood End Grain Block with Groove is wonderful! Its compact and durable. It washes easily and is so versatile. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Poor Quality,"Never put in the dishwasher or used to cut hot meats, but after three uses it was cracked and unuseable. Won't be buying this brand again!"
2,Good product except design flaw,I have had an Atlantis 1600 for about 10 years. The flaw is in the clamp cradle. It is held in place on the screw by a couple very small and week pieces of plastic. After taking the box off the vehicle you have to be extrodinarily careful not to bump one of the clamps or the cradle will break off. Hard to do since no matter how you look at it the clamps are protruding from the bottom that you have to set it on. In 2007 Thule was great about ordering replacements. Today non are available. Seems if you are marketing lasting quality they should at least offer replacement parts for an extended period of time. I know I won't get rooked by the name again
3,Interesting Tips,"This book is good for the advanced reloader and someone iterested in wildcats particularly the Arnold Magnums. Also, provides little tips on reloading that help improve accuracy. Good book if your looking for some different techniques and want to learn about some interesting new cartridges."
3,High Power Rifle Accuracy - Before You Shoot,"This was a worthwhile book at the price I paid for it ($13.47 @Sportsman's Guide), but it did not have three calibers I was interested in. There is no mention at all about 8mm Mauser (just the wildcat 8mm-06); the data for .30-06 does not cover MIGarand handloading; and the .45-70 Trapdoor is mentioned in the intro for the Marlin .45-70 by saying the Trapdoor takes a lighter load, but no data is provided.What was astounding was a review of the new and used market for this book, that was published in 2006 at a list price of $24.95, which now ranges from $44.12 to $344.00! It is not worth more than the list price."
3,"Cheap, was ok for a while, did not last too long.","This is reasonable value as it is very inexpensive, and a nice size, but it is not particularly well made. After a couple years it started to warp and split. The gutter leaks when the board starts splitting."
3,Not a bad Cutting Board,"Board is indeed a quality board, but with a name like Craftsmen, I had expected a bit higher quality."
4,It worked,I had a sensor go out and this worked for me. Shipped and received as advertised. Overall I would recommend a buy.
1,Lousy,"Bought it in March, it's now Sept. 2 and it doesn't work - the light stays on all the time. The previous motion sensor socket I had lasted 12 years!"
3,"Works well, but sensitive","Works alright, but it's a bit sensitive. It also won't fit in some light fixtures. For the price, I would buy it again.One and a half antlers up."
3,needs a battery,"It doesn't say it anywhere I can find in the description, but this needs a 9 volt battery. I was replacing a unit that needed batteries - I'd gotten very tired of replacing batteries... so I returned it."
4,Thomas & Betts #HS3100D Grey Motion Light Adapter,"This is an excellent way to install a motion detector without having to worry about wiring in a new one. This model works well as described. For those not wanting to mess with having to re-wire an existing outlet, this is the product for you."
2,Didn't Last Long,"I bought this product in January and was very happy with it. This morning, May 2nd, the bulb blew. After replacing the bulb, it is always on. It never times out.Not a very good investment."
3,Steven,"Grey color, requires 9 volt battery.I had some trouble getting motion sensor windowto face 180 degrees away from the outside wallwhen screwed fully into the light bulb socket."
2,NEEDS 9V BATTERY,RETURNED IT NEEDS A BATTERY. I didn't see this before I ordered it.There are other models that just run of the normal 110v socket as I expeted this loo at other items avoid one that your going to constantly replace batteries on.
5,A well documented history,"This book was originally lent to me by a brother Knight as I contemplated joining the 4th degree of the Knights of Columbus. It is so well written and annotated, that I had to purchase one for myself. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Knights of Columbus or interested in knowing more about the history of this fine organization."
5,Very pretty speaker cloth.,I received this and was very happy with the overall color and quality of the product. It is more transparent than I expected so I'll have to paint the underlying cabinet black.I'm using this to replace the funky grill cloth on my Fender Champion 600 as well as a cabinet I built for a Jensen Mod-8 speaker.
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE IT!!!!! I absolutely CAN NOT miss a single episode of this show...and I don't have a DVR, so what does that tell you! In my opinion, this is the best show since ""Wonder Years""...THE CLASSIC FAMILY SITCOM IS BACK!!!!!"
1,Disc Missing,"I purchased this disc set as a Christmas gift for my family. When it came I threw away all the packaging and receipt. Christmas morning we opened it, and disc 3 was missing! I doubt I will be able to do anything about it because I don't have the receipt and I opened it. I am very unhappy, and will probably think twice before purchasing a DVD from Amazon.com again."
4,The middle,I thought this show was pretty funny. One of the best parts of the show is that it actually looks like they could be a lower middle class family. (other than the percieved size of their house. It seems huge like any TV show setting) I will be buying the second season when it comes out.
5,True Genius,We had many people recommend this product to us and we are so glad we listened. The reality is that this family is like most of us in the US just trying to do our best to get through each day. The package did come a little banged up but if you are looking for some HILARIOUS TV you can't pass this one up!
5,Love the Series!,this is a gift for my sister who has never seen this series. I love it and I am sure she will as well!
5,Great beginner guitar!,"Got this for Christmas for my 8 year old and he loves it. Lessons start next week. Great quality product, american classic even though it's made in china."
4,great 3/4 scale guitar,This hot pink 3/4 scale low end fender is a great buy. I purchased for my 3 year old and uts still a little big for her. Better suited for 5+ yrs. Sounds really good going through my1968 fender twin.
4,Nice starter guitar,"We bought this for Christmas for our 9 year old in hopes he may want to learn to play. So far, he loves just strumming it loudly. However, it does seem to be a nice well-made guitar. A good size for him and should last him for a while. It is somewhat difficult to tune, but i am not really a guitar player (piano), so going at it kinda blind. It is a ver pretty color and definitely has the cool factor!"
5,"So far, 5 Stars...Update: Still 5 stars!!","I'll update after Christmas when my son gets a hold of it. I've already plugged it up and strummed it a bit and it seems perfect for my almost 6-year-old. He's really still too young to learn to play but he wants one and at his age, he just wants to make noise so this is great! It's absolutely gorgeous and I just know he'll feel like a rockstar when he plays it.UPDATE: My son LOVES his guitar. It has a really nice sound. Even though this guitar is smaller than a full-size one, it's still a little big for my little guy and his shoulder starts hurting after playing around for 5 minutes. I think I'd recommend this guitar for a kid who is at least 8 years old. At least my son will grow into it. I definitely recommend this to anybody who has a child interested in music. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,Canot tune it.,"Three diferent people who know what they are doing just cannot tune it. So a ""squier by Fender"" that cannot be tunned is like a mercedez that is just sitting in your parking lot"
5,Amazing,I got exactly what I wanted and expected with this item. I gave it to my girlfriend as a christmas present and she absolutely loved it. It came very fast. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1,No Need for THIS Tenchi!,"Tenchi Universe is a horrible show. The OVA Tenchi series (the real series) is unbelievably better; it is funnier, smarter, and has better animation. Other than its theme song, there really isn't anything good about this series!"
3,Not a close shave,"Not a close shave, was hoping for better. It will get the longer hairs. Plus it's battery operated (which I knew about when I bought it) I recommend another brand"
3,OK for the price.,I wanted a battery operated one and this was a OK buy. I don't like the extra floating trimmer on it. I also have to take the bottom off and push in the starter button manually almost everytime I use it.
3,Ok for a battery operated shaver.,"I had the old style battery operated shaver and I loved it, so I thought that after the screen broke it would be cheaper to buy a new battery operated shaver. It is okay, but a bit harsh on my legs. It shaves about as good as my electric shaver, but not great. If you are looking for the convenience of a battery operated shaver then this is a good shaver. It does not come with a protective screen for the shaving head. I wish I had not thrown the old one out with the old shaver."
4,Pretty good dry shave,"Not a real close shave like a razor, but works in a pinch when you need a dry shave in a hurry. I like that it only works on batteries, I hate having lots of plug-ins in the bathroom. I just toss this in the cabinet. Batteries that came with this have lasted a long time."
2,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I bought this one as an alternative to manual shavers because it's really hard to shave your legs in a dorm room's shower stall. I was looking forward to this shaver because it was inexpensive, but still had a good review. But, it was not what I expected at all!, It does it's job, but only after going over and over the area again and again. It also doesn't leave my legs as silky smooth as a manual razor does. It's alright when I'm not able to shower and use a manual shaver, but I wouldn't use it all the time. I'm going to shop around some more for a better quality one."
1,Horrible,"I spent almost 10 minutes attempting to shave my legs. The hair was short because I shaved yesterday, but there was enough stubble for me to need to shave today. It won't shave the short hairs, and you have to keep going over the same spots again and again. After 10 minutes I put it down and got my disposable razor. It was much faster and did a much better job. And even though I used the same shaving gel I always use, there are little red bumps all over my legs now."
1,Not Very Rechargable!,I bought one of these for my wife this Christmas. She finally tells me that it won't hold a charge. She literally has to keep it in the charging holder 24/7 in order to use it. Take it out for a day and it's dead. So much for taking this for a weekend get-a-way. Have to bring the charger too. Not very portable. This is the last Remington I will ever buy!
4,I love this little guy!,"This is great for wet or dry shaving! I use mine all the time, and the battery lasts a long while too. It works best with wet shaving (you'll get a smoother finish), but for dry shaving, it's awesome for touch-up or if you forget to shave!I've bought this for my mom and sister, and they love it too! Great deal for the price as well!"
4,Gives a decently close leg shave with no nicks,"I've used this shaver about 6 times now -- only as a dry razor (not with water). It is serving its purpose for me: no need to fuss with charging it (uses batteries), easy to hold, provides a reasonably close shave fairly quickly (doesn't require several passes over the same area, and I feel like I'm ready to go out in the world in short pants), and seems to not irritate my skin at all. I like not having to get in the shower to shave my legs. If I want a super close shave, I'll use a standard razor in the shower -- but even then, sometimes that irritates my skin and isn't worth it.For the price, this is worth a try if you have needs similar to mine. I do wish that the folks designing these razors could come up with a way to make them a bit quieter (though this one is no louder than any others I've heard)."
2,not very good,"I thought I would pick this up as a travel shaver, to replace one that has stopped working. I should have saved my money."
3,WARNING,"I find it alarming that a toy for a one-year-old includes a 26-inch cord (attached to the biggest car) that my baby liked to wrap around her neck. The cars are otherwise fun for her, but I had to remove the cord."
1,"Unwatchable picture, don't buy it!","The sound hisses all the time, the picture is unwatchable, this DVD was transferred from a very bad film copy or even some crap VHS."
4,wind turbine review,"Ordered and received a Ventmatic CX0012TWS wind turbine in good condition. But I assumed this was a complete unit but it is not. There is no mounting base for it. Unless this is a replacement head , it worthless to you. There is no place in the description explaining this. There needs to be one added. I had to purchase a base locally from a local hardware store. When questioning Amazon they refered me to the mfg. And they sell only to dealers and wholesale. Once I found a base it works OK."
3,"Nice, just completely overpriced","Received a padfolio having a non-working calculator. After contacting the vendor I learned that they can't just ship you a 3 dollar calculator (really not worth more than that), but that they have to ship an entire padfolio with it. To do that they put a hold on your credit card (in case you don't return the original delivery) for something like $38 dollars ... now, I paid $57 through Amazon? Hmmm - I guess that just confirms that this item is hopelessly overpriced. Other than that, the leather is soft, but not too soft, so it will take some abuse. I have been using it daily and it holds up well. It has the simple elegance I was looking for in a business notepad. Just don't know why it is so hard to find an 8 x 5 with calculator and in leather .. no wonder they can charge that much."
1,Item received not as item being advertised by seller,"The item advertised is not the same as the item received? Why not be honest with buyers? I would have NEVER purchased this item if I had known. The item interior has this large cheap mesh looking side pocket with a zipper that has a calculator attached on a string. The padfolio has a zipper that runs along the outer edges of the padfolio. This is perhaps something suitable for a child but not as a business professional, which is fine - but BE HONEST with what you are adversting as being sold/purchased. }:("
5,Just Wonderful,"I thought this was an easy read book. Interesting charaters that kept me reading, finished the book in 1 day. I can't wait for your next book Candi Wine. Keep up the good work.........."
4,Non-fiction account of the assissanation of Lincoln and Booth's attemt to escape to the south,"Lots of factual history here about Lincoln, Secretary of State Seward, Secretary of Defense Stanton and the group of men who plot to kill Lincoln, Seward and Vice President Jackson after the Civil war has just ended. How the plots were laid out, how the plots were carried out and how the union tried to track down Booth and his accomplices as they try to escape to the far south. If you are a Lincoln or Civil War historian buff you will want to read this one. There are lots of interesting facts and what-ifs. This is a hard book to put down."
5,Simply a great read,The book reads much like a novel. The author does a great job of pulling all his research together to tell the story of the fateful events leading up to and after the assassination of Lincoln. You won't be able to put this book down - it is highly recommended!
4,A real page turner...,"History really comes alive in this fast paced and full of suspense book. Even though we all have known this story since 4th grade, the author makes all the characters from Lincoln to John Wilkes Booth come to life. Toward the end, I thought it got a bit too wordy and so many characters were mentioned that I found it hard to follow..thus the 4 stars. But that said, I found it hard to put down. Highly recommended ."
4,The rest of the story...,I did not know anything about Abraham Lincoln's assassin beyond his shooting of the president. This book provides the ending of the story for me. Booth did suffer in those 12 days and those who helped him did as well. The book provides insight into the motivations of Booth and his accomplices.
3,Overblown,"Swanson's hyperbolic style (i.e., a hangman's rope = a ""hemp persuader"") turns ""Manhunt"" into a bit of a soap opera -- read the stunning ""American Brutus"" for the most indepth telling of the JWB saga instead."
4,"Mmm, mmm, good","OK, so the author may have taken a few liberties here and there with dialouge and thoughts that he could not have known, those shortcomings are very minor in the total scheme of things. And, boy is this a great read, especially if you enjoy Civl War tales. Several of the reviews use the term, ""pageturner"". Yep, that's how I saw it. Highly recommended."
4,very good,This book rates very well amongst historical writings. It reads more like a novel than non-fiction and shares many insights not readily known.
5,What if I don't wanna give my review a title?,"I bought this book at the store today, purely as an impulse-buy, and have had to tear myself away from reading it. I was attracted by the fact that it's not pedantic, dry, and that it doesn't read like a textbook. That is what puts me off about most history books; I don't have the patience for some overblown scholar who wants to show off 50 cent words. This book is exciting, fast-paced, and as other reviewers have said, comes off as more of a 'who dunnit,' than a typical history book."
3,Very Poor Quality edition,"The text itself is superb. This edition is of very low quality, however. Cheap cardboard cover, poor paper quality, poor printing. This edition is maginally above the quality of a paperback. The price, however, is hardcover all the way. If I had examined this in a book store, I would not have bought it. I would have sought out a higher quality edition. Again, there was no readily apparent indication of the low quality of the edition on the Amazon site."
3,"Well written, effusive detail","A bit too much tangential detail at times, and perhaps over-dramatized at others, this is still a wonderfully informative read."
5,excellent,An Excellent read! and it is rare I call something 'excellent'. reads like a fictional book. A GREAT STORY
3,man yawn,This is a detailed account of the facts surrounding the death of Lincoln and the seach for Booth. A good reference and history piece but the dry writing and slow pace kept me getting up to keep from falling asleep.
5,Reads like Fiction- amazing!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is exciting from beginning to end. Due to the amazing detail that the author has put into this book, you almost feel like you were there. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves Abraham Lincoln....."
5,Hearsay Review,Purchased as a gift for a friend. Haven't had a chance to borrow it back yet. Friend rated it @ 5 stars. Both are anxiously awaiting movie release.
2,poorly written,A good topic and many interesting facts but they are jumbled into a mix of unorganized thoughts and generalizations. I will not recommend this book. If you like history read River of Doubt instead.
1,keep a hanky handy,"this book is so poorly written, it will bring tears to your eyes. bar none, the very worst civil war book i have ever read. the only reason i gave it 1 star was that 0 stars is not available."
5,Great chase!,"Great book that is easy to read, historically accurate and interesting in the details it provides into such an important event."
5,This is a great read!,"I have just finished reading James L. Swanson's 'Manhunt'. A page turner from start to finish; this was the most absorbing, engaging novel that I have read in quite some time. John Wilkes Booth and his partners in crime are brought to life in riveting detail. I was amazed to discover so many facts surrounding Lincoln's murder. I had always assumed that Dr. Samuel Mudd was an innocent man; simply providing aid to an injured stranger. This book clearly shatters that myth. Dr. Mudd knew who Booth was, and in fact had an opportunity to turn him in to Union soldiers. He chose to keep quiet, and paid a heavy price for that decision. I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Not the same old Licoln Assassination Story,James Swanson has written a very detailed and thoroughly researched account of the assassination of Lincoln and the ensuing hunt for his killer. I learned quite a few things which I had never heard before about Booth and his attempts to elude capture. This book has the elements of a true crime thriller but every detail is historical fact. The only cricism I have is that there were some parts which seemed a bit repetitious to me. Photos of some of the key players in the plot are included.
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be,"Prior to reading this book I had heard the rave reviews and how it had been placed on numerous Top Ten list. I guess my expectations were too high, because I was hoping for so much more. I thought it was going to be a sweeping, epic, and exciting telling of the chase for Lincoln's killer. Instead, it was merely... OK. Some parts were dull while others were pretty riveting. Too bad there weren't enough of those riveting parts."
4,Can't lend this book,"While, for the most part,I enjoyed the book, towards the end it got a bit long with some of the details. I would have recommended my step-dad read it if I could have lent it to him for free but I would NOT recommend he purchase it for $10.99, if that tells you anything."
5,Manhunt: The 12-day Chase for Lincoln's Killer,"The Manhunt: 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer was well written to the point that I felt like I was apart of the whole horrific event. Because of the non-stop suspense and drama, it was extremely hard to put down. I look forward to any other Book written by James L. Swanson. Thanks for the Great Read."
5,History at its best,"Obviously, many reviews of this book have already been written so I'll keep mine short and sweet. In a nutshell, Manhunt is history at its best. James Swanson has written a well researched, engaging, lively, highly readable, and entertaining look at the assassination of Lincoln and the chase for Booth. I've read a couple books on the last days of the Civil War and this is perhaps the best of the bunch. As someone who reads history books exclusively, I can tell you that this book is amongst the best history books written in the last several years and is well researched to boot."
3,Author Swanson obviously admires Booth,"There are only a very few historical figures whom one dare not express admiration for: Hitler, Lee Harvey Oswald, Charles Manson, and perhaps Bernie Madoff. In the next tier, where expressing a favorable opinion puts the speaker at risk of denunciation resides John Wilkes Booth, Josef Stalin, Chairman Mao, and many others. In other words, it can get dicey to be too overt with one's affinity for these people. The author of ""Manhunt"" very obviously admires Booth and would love to come out and say it. Instead, Swanson probably unintentionally paints Booth as a thoroughly repugnant and failed character through the imagined dialogue and circumstances that he infuses his book with. We know the basic outline of the story, including Booth's and his accomplices' fates. It's a good yarn, very readable. Just don't bring your ideology or a sense of the tragedy which was Lincoln's assassination along with you."
3,Well Written,"No doubt, ""Manhunt"" is well-written and easy to digest. But I prefer ""Blood on the Moon"" (Edward Steers) to this of Lincoln's assassination: it provides more details about what happened, why it happened, and the aftermath.The title ""Manhunt"" is somewhat misleading. Most pages focus on what Booth's and Herold's whereabouts during the hunt -- not the federal government's pursuit of Booth and its numerous blunders.But ""Manhunt"" is easier to digest than ""Blood on the Moon."" If you are looking for an easy-to-read account of Lincoln's murder, I recommend this book.On the other hand, if you are willing to pick through ""Blood on the Moon,"" I believe you will be rewarded with more knowledge about this historical event."
4,An exciting tale with a mixture of precise research and imaginative license,"An excellent book with detailed accurate prose, this historical thriller is what gets people turned on to history, although how the author could apprehend the look in Booth's eyes as he sneaks through the streets of Washington is beyond me, particularly when he describes him as being alone. If you can accept the omnicient narrator as acceptable in relating history, you shouldn't have any trouble being carried away by the flow of the story even if the author uses a bit of poetic license now and then."
4,Manhunt-The Chase to Catch Lincoln's Killer,"This is a topnotch historical mystery written from factual data.I enjoyed every word and although we all knew how it was going to end there were enough innuendos to keep it interesting.It follows the killing of Lincoln from before the shooting to the capture but gives many facts that the reader was not aware of prior to reading.Booth's background, his accomplices and how he tried to evade Federal troops were all very interesting.All in all- A Great Read!"
4,A Factual Read,"Swanson is adept at taking factual history and putting it into a very readable story. Held my interest throughout. To take the sparse writings of Booth along with the situation of having spent so much of the 12 days in one place, he manages to hold the reader's interest by going back to what the other characters are doing at the same time he is languishing in a pine grove."
5,Manhunt - A great read,I am only half way through the book & I alradey don't want it to end. It is a wonderful jistory lesson and reads like a terrific novel. I will certainly look at other things by this author.
5,Great page-turner,"""Manhunt"" must surely be the definitive account of the Lincoln assassination and the hunt for the perpetrators. It reads like a novel but is also full of interesting information that stays with you long after finishing the book. Why couldn't history class have been like this? It comes pretty close to being there. Buy it, read it, reread it, give it as a gift. Highly recommended."
4,JWB on the Run,"A nice retelling of the chase and capture of those responsible for the conspiracy to kill the top leadership of the Union in April 1865. Mr. Swanson, with a gift for narrative, brings to this book the knowledge of one deeply and personally immersed in the history surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln."
5,A fast read for Licoln fans,"If you've always been drawn to stories about Lincoln but find the historical texts pretty dry, then this book is for you. Swanson is a captivating story teller and as a historian, brings this exciting time in history to life."
3,"Interesting book, but useful to whom?","I enjoyed this book. The trouble with recommending it is that I don't know who would benefit from it.If you are starting a club, there are better books.If you have a child in chess, there are better books (e.g. a book by Heisman).If you ARE a child in chess, there are better books.Whatever your level, there are better books.But this one is well-written and reliable. It is a good choice for library collections.Each section of this book could have a different audience. There is useful advice on using chess computers, explanations of ratings, clarifications of tournament rules, descriptions of timing options, and more.One section which stands out is the one on Openings. It explains practical openings in words and gives illustrative games.The information here is generally superior to Pandolfini's book on chess trivia, but it can be hard to locate. This is really a book for browsing. It is very readable."
3,Cohen needs to consult his logic text,"Cohen's sophomoric replies to Regan's claims for extending basic moral consideration to nonhuman animals makes a mockery of this debate (a surprising deficit, given Cohen's training and reputation as a logician). Regan, in contrast, is scholarly and thoughtful, though one suspects that his case for ""animal rights"" (and consequent absolutism) continues to faulter against the foundational assumption of the ""equal inherent value of all subjects of a life"" and concommitant rejection of all extrinsic (relational) ethical considerations. See M. Silliman, *Sentience and Sensibility,* for an value-incrementalist alternative to Regan's antiperfectionist unicriterialism."
4,humorous problem has no solution provided,"Most children's books have problems that are solved in a few pages. When Huckleberry Hound (and friends Pixie and Dixie) find a goldfish who has the hiccups, they try to help the fish in all the ways you probably tried as a child, when you had the hiccups. I was very amused to see that, at the end of the book, they still haven't figured it out, leaving your child to come up with his or her own solution (if they are so inclined)."
1,What a waste,"This movie is going into my ever growing list of completely worthless, mentally frustrating movies to watch. No offense to the main actors, as I believe a failed drama is often the fault of the director/producers/writers -- those people whose faces you may never see. I feel sorry for those who wasted their time in producing this. The story was severely disjointed, and the acting was nauseating at times and laughable at others. I had so many moments of, Huh? Say what? and You've got to be kidding me, while watching this. Not worth the couple of hours I will never get back. If only I would learn to make this judgment at the beginning and not convince myself to sit through the whole thing, hoping desperately that the miserable story and acting at some obscure and never atainable point will be redeemed. Blech."
3,Stateline Motel,"Stateline Motel is an English dubbed Italian film. The story is good as well as the sound and picture, if you can stand the dubbed feature. Eli Wallach's voice is recognizable, and gives a good preformance as a heavy. It's worth a buck or two for watching a few times, then give it to Uncle Harry next Christmas. He might enjoy it more than a tie."
1,Not good,"I used the spray for about 10-15 minutes and nothing came out. It's a bad system that the hose hooks up to and doesn't work. Too bad, the product looks great, but the results don't match the what the product says."
2,Eh...,"This is the best I can find, but I live in Houston, and like another reviewer said, nothing works well. But I have to use this once a week. And it is more expensive here. Get it at Wal-Mart."
1,DO NOT BUY,"As with other reviewers, I got so far then Cutter stopped coming out around the 16 oz. mark. What is even more frustrating is filling out the entire customer contact questionnaire on their website including UPC, lot #, and personal info then the ""submit"" button conveniently doesn't work (nor did ""enter""). I know that I am not in alone in the feeling of being constantly jerked around by these corporations that are only looking out for their stockholders which, obviously, no longer includes customer satisfaction. When this happens to me, I stop doing business with the offending company period, end of story, bye-bye. If more of us did this, it would speak volumes....just saying"
4,Worked for me!,"I read all the reviews so far, and yep, the spray nozzle is pretty junky but I bought enough bottles to swap them out when I needed to. It is worth it to have even a week or two with less mosquitoes. You really need to watch the fluid level in the container and make sure it is sucking. I use about half the container and then half of another and keep combining them to get a whole one....I know it is not a wonderful process, but the stuff works and is better than getting West Nile or coating your entire body DEET with is ALSO toxic."
1,Won't dispense chemical,"This product used to work in past years. But now, it will not dispense the chemical. This has happened with the last two bottles I bought."
5,Bugs.R.Gone,I wonder if there has been product improvement. It wasn't until after we bought the product I found this review!We sprayed after tropical storm Deby came through FL and birthed a lot of mosquitoes. It has noticeable and quickly helped. We had no issues with the function of spraying the yard.
1,dispensor nozzles defective,"used for several years. killing ingredient for mosquitoes changed occasionally, but worked well on mosquitoes.problem is that last few years the hose attachment sprayer's do not work. i kept and used one dispensor that worked for several years until it gave out.finally gave up and returned several bottles over a couple years to walmart. noticed on last walmart visit that they no longer sell product at my local stores.i guess i know why!"
1,Will not dispense product,"Good exercise but other than that a waste of time. Sprayed for 15 minutes and the bottle is still completely full....nothing came out of the bottle to kill the bugs. I tried it several times with the same results-like I say, ""Great exercise"", if you don't mind wasting your time. The bug juice stays in the bottle. I will never buy another Cutter Product and you should too."
1,Multiple sprayer bottles broken,"Similar to other reviews, I purchased several of the bottles at once. All of them were broken in that only water sprayed. The product never left the bottle. Do not buy! It can't work if nothing ever comes out."
3,$9.97 at Lowes,The cutter spray works fairly well but NOT for 8 weeks as advertised. I live just outside of Houston and nothing really works totally. But this will keep if from getting really bad if I apply it every other week. I would buy it on Amazon but they are asking $14.99 and it is only $9.97 at the local Lowe's.
1,delivery system is horrible,"The plastic connector kept popping off my hose - I was completely soaked in less that 10 minutes. I had to keep crimping the hose and re-connecting, only for it to pop out of place again. When I turned the white dial to the ""on"" position, IT kept popping off as well allowing water to jet out everywhere. water with pesticide. all over me. not fun at all.cheap plastic parts all the way around that fail. I would never buy this product again"
5,Insect Repellent,"I have tried several other products to kill the insects in my back yard and have never had the success I have had with the Cutter Bug Free Backyard Insect repellent. Due to the weather this summer it was impossible to enjoy the swimming pool without the mosquitos eating us up, but after spraying with the Cutter Bug Free Backyard Insect Repellent, we enjoyed our back yard and pool all summer."
1,Piece of Crap & Dangerous!!,"This ready-to-spray bottle from Cutter is, to put it softly, a piece of crap. The bottle is designed to be hooked to the hose. The problem is that once you hook the hose up, there are two places where the bottle itself will come apart - at the neck of the bottle and where the hose connects to the bottle. These two joints will just pop up w/ little resistance under normal use. The end result is danger to the person holding the bottle. Imagine spraying and the bottle comes apart w/ the liquid all over you.Whoever designed and approved this bottle should be fired."
2,Sort of works,"Forget 8 weeks and consider yourself lucky if it works for 1 week... or even for 1 day. I sprayed my deck and yard the day I was having guests over that night. We weren't swarmed, but there were mosquitos biting. Had to light citronella candles and put those around which did seem to solve the problem. Cutter used to work for at least a week. I sprayed carefully and completely and really covered the deck area which is where we were sitting.Also, the connector on the sprayer that attaches to the hose kept popping off. I think had to turn off the hose and press down to reconnect. Happened 2 times, so that's a lot of trouble."
1,Mosquito Steroid Juice,"I think stuff has made our mosquito problem even worse maybe. It seems like the mosquitos are even stronger now. And, the word is getting around the neighborhood now and the mosquitos are swarming. This spray is worthless."
1,I literally sprayed bugs with this; they flipped me off and kept going,"I have lots of bugs everywhere: under my deck, on top of my deck, beyond the deck, in my front yard, in my bushes, in my flower bed. So I was given this by a neighbor and sprayed both her lawn and mine with it. The only thing that this seem to bother were the black thatch beetles (not japanese beetles)that apparently don't do much harm to lawns. I just saw them scatter about with a few dead ones on the lawn after I sprayed. Other than that, the little black ants are still everywhere, as are spiders, and springtails.All in all, if you have a really bad bug problem like I do---don't use this because it's too weak. This made no real difference in killing the bugs I wanted to kill."
3,Cracked board,I agree this is an ideal cutting board for a small kitchen. But the one we received split at the corner just a week after we started using it.
1,Broke into pieces =(,"The cutting board was very nice-looking, however I left it in the sink for a few days and when I went to clean it, the moisture had caused it to split into three pieces. I would not recommend buying this cutting board based on the other reviewers' comments too."
3,"The pictures can't be beat, but....","the text is a pretty generic ""dogs for dummies"" type of book. Having recently bought my first Irish Terrier -- not to mention my first terrier -- I would have liked more specifics about the breed itself, how to groom it, how its personality impacts training, etc. Instead we get gorgeous pictures, together with the breed standard (which is free on the internet), and generic grooming tips, then several chapters on how to introduce [any] puppy to a new home, how to socialize, how to feed, what types of common ailments to look out for. Unfortunate to waste a captive audience, since there is so little available real-time information about the breed."
4,IT BOOK,"Good pictures....Ill give them credit for that, but they didnt give too much information on the actual breed, rather dogs in general. Like the grooming chapter, it recomends you CUT the dogs fur?? it hardly brings up stripping....or how to groom for the show ring. The give us all the obvious stuff about bringing home a new puppy, and all the diseases a dog could possibly get.....not just the IT!! anywho......yeah...thats all!!"
1,Not worth the money,"As a classic car restorer, I had hoped this book would get me started on doing and saving money on my own upholstery work. Terribly disappointed. The book is 20 years out of date. Auto upholstery for a long time has been sold as pre-sewn and fitted, as well as molded carpet for the flooring; this book attempts to demonstrate making upholstery from scratch. The black and white pictures are absouletly awful - more black than white. The section on installing a covertible is so bad its funny."
3,horrible photos,The info in the book would make this a 4.5 book becuase it is correct and very good info. I found out how good by actually taking car seats etc apart with the text. The photos are so horrible that had I not had an actual car to take apart I would have been confused as hell. The photos take away 2 stars and thats me being nice about it becuase the info is good. This book really needs to be in color or at the very least clear black and white photos. Despite this it is one of the better books on this subject.
4,Good basics,"This book, granted it is older has a lot of good advice and lessons. It is not a textbook, and it doesn't have the greatest pictures, but it truly is well written and helps make a lot of things I have questioned crystal clear. A true value for the money."
2,low quality,"I was not at all impressed with this book. The pictures are all black and white and of very low quality. The work that's shown in this book is all done on cars from the late 80's and early 90's so don't let the publishing date fool you that it's all new current work. Plus don't let the cover fool you, there is nothing inside that shows how to make cool custom interiors on cool hot rods.It seems like this guy took a bunch of old photos he had of past work and compiled them into a book. This book is not worth the paper it is printed on."
2,Misleading!,"The cover says ""Make and install headliners"". We are building a hot rod from a fiberglass body and need to know how to do the interior, specifically headliners and door panels. This book only tells you how to buy and replace a headliners NOT how to make one. If I could buy one it would probably come with instructions so I would not need this book. The last chapter on Street Rod Interiors just gives some poor quality photos with sketchy info on how they were done."
4,good pointers & tips,We re-upholstered a back seat for a 1968 Camaro convertibleand read this book while doing so.It has several helpful hints for old school cars.
1,Poorly written; terrible photos,"Automotive Upholstery Handbook by Don Taylor is a waste of money. If you want a step-by-step how-to guide, this is NOT it. Poorly written. Little or no editing. Terrible photos. Trying to follow what he is saying and doing is totally frustrating. Too much on vinyl tops & other specialty tops. Boats & motorcycles & car show are needless filler. Don Taylor may know his stuff, but he certainly does not know how to communicate clearly. A good editor would have been a big help."
2,Disappointed,"well, there seems to be a general lack of information on all auto upholstery books and this was no exception. Poor quality photos, can't tell anything by them. Book is written by someone who knows the business but is not a teacher. Most people buying these books just want to do they're own 1 or 2 car project. Like myself. We need details for everything. You ""the writer"" needs to explain the process from start to finish, including how to thread a sewing machine, type of threads, types of foam and uses, adhesives, materials, tools, supplies. I've been learning a lot on my own and got some good ideas from youtube and some from this book. I know that this is a craft and probably takes time to learn. ***All I can say is: Keep writing and making these books better""*** / Update it with better photos, descriptions and ideas. Thank you!"
4,Excellent informative book,"This book is great for getting started in the basics of Auto Upholstery. It explains the very basics, the tools needed, terms of the trade, and even gives you a project to try out your skills and tools. It is plainly written so is easy to understand. The only things I did not like were the black and white pictures and that the book only really dealt with working with vinyl, and it has many sections on replacing vinyl tops on cars and convertables when I was hoping for more basic projects like normal car seats that are out of fabric instead of vinyl. One plus is it does have a section on boats seats and motorcycle seats. Overall, it is a good book to have especially to get started with."
1,Another album with a dumb title,"Another album with a dumb title after 'White Trash With Money': 'Big Dog Daddy'. Sounds 'very Country', doesn't it? It sounds more like a book for toddlers than a Country album. How can this guy be taken seriously?I don't think he knows exactly what his fans want. His songs about bars, drinking, booze and women may appeal to people like him but they are not to the taste of everybody. If he thinks it is what all his fans want he is wrong. He doesn't know his audience. Some of his fans are not really interested in songs about Jack Daniels whiskey, a couple having sex in a pickup truck, a woman in a mini skirt ( what's next? A song about a woman in a bikini?) or his pro-war politics ( I don't get how this warmonger claims he 'prays for peace on earth every night' ). Same garbage. No originality. It seems that it is all he has to offer. Very disappointing. It is not hard to figure out why he has lost a lot of fans."
1,terrible music,"I don't know what is wrong with people, this guy is terrible. How he sells albums is a mystery to me, must be Nascar fans who don't know any better. If you spent money on this album I fell sorry for you."
5,Too late for free..,"This is an excellent song and i like it alot. Matter of fact i pretty much always liked Toby Keith. It's too bad that you guys put this song as free because it's too late. I already have the album.It might have been a better idea to make ""She's a hottie"" free because that's the only new song on 35 Biggest Hits. :)Anyway, i give this song 5 stars. A+"
4,The Big Dog Daddy,"Toby's first album on his own label is great. I am a huge fan, and have noticed some differences between this album and his past albums, but I am pleased with this one. Good listening!!"
4,Toby is a Big Dog Daddy,"Toby is such a bad boy (not really) with a good sound. Enjoy this latest collection. Good selections as always, including current singles."
5,Toby Keith Rocks!,Yet another great CD from Toby Keith! The songs range from funny to reflective. Toby creates the images that work the imagination. A CD to listen to again and again.
2,Same old Warbulation...,"Toby can't really hit the notes so he warbles all over them. If you really need to listen to this it is best accompanied by heavy drinking. While better than most of the other stuff lately, TK is not much of a musician. In other times this stuff would have been filed in the ""Novelty"" section. Like great music? Look to Austin.Just my opinion, I could be wrong. Not likely, but possible.~duke"
5,Mastiff of Music,"The cd is titled Big Dog Daddy and if Toby Keith is the Big Dog, he is a mastiff* for sure! As I listen over and over I try to find my favorite song -- impossible. Each song -- from fast moving, kick up your heels music -- to the slow ballads and love songs -- is perfect. Toby Keith continues to produce music that will be with us for generations!Unfamiliar with the mastiff breed? Here is what the encyclopedia says:""What the Lion is to the Catthe Mastiff is to the Dog,the noblest of the family;he stands alone,and all others sink before him.His courage does not exceedhis temper and generosity,and in attachment he equalsthe kindest of his race.""Five Stars with an A+ to boot!LisaT"
1,On the brink of unlistenable...,"I approached ""Big Dog Daddy"" with an open mind but I have to say that it rivals K-Fed's ""Playing With Fire"" as the most unlistenable album of all time (and appeals to the same dumbed-down audience). It is one of the most over-produced, insincere, steaming piles of garbage I have heard in a long time. The guy just has nothing to say. You can't let your ""boots do the talking"" through the speakers. I guess he should have stuck to football."
2,Toby has lost it,"I own every Toby Keith CD so buying this one was a no-brainer. Not only does the CD lack fun songs, but they're not catchy either. I could barely even listen to the whole thing. This CD is nowhere near the quality that How do you like me now?!, Pull my chain, Unleashed, and Shockin' Ya'll. Honkytonk U was just ok, and White trash with money had some fun songs like get drunk and be somebody, and running block.This CD is not Toby Keith quality stuff. Borrow it from a friend to listen to it before you buy it."
4,Great differentiation,"Love this CD. There are numbers that rock (like the title song Big Dog Daddy), but also a few slower ballads, bit of real country and in between. And all with this great voice of Toby Keith. Great to listen to in the car. Worth all the costs of shipping and taxes to get it here in the Netherlands."
1,"Man this guy sucks, was he ever good?","I wish I could give it no stars, but amazon won't let me. Hell would be stuck in a room with this guy singing. God bless Texas country"
1,1,"This book is so dry that I thought that I was reading soda crackers. If there is valuable information between these covers, it is buried in dust."
1,I wouldn't recommend it.,"My baby is very mild-mannered and ""easy"" to take care of, but it's hard to keep him in this swing for very long. He prefers the side to side cradle-motion swinging of the aquarium swing. The back and forth motion of this swing doesn't relax him at all. Also, the bears seemed to scare him when he was younger and the music seems to annoy him. He absolutely loves the aquarium swing. He easily falls asleep in that one."
1,swing caught my son's leg,"At about 3 months old, this swing caught my son's leg under the tray. The middle of the tray comes down to almost meet the seat which slopes up to keep each leg on its own side. My son was somehow able to slide one leg under the tray in the middle and while swinging, shifted his weight. He screamed and I immediately removed him, but not before it pinched. He ended up with a large bruise on his lower leg. Very scary but luckily no broken bone. I was very surprised to have this happen when using a product exactly as designed. Too bad because he loved the swing and it has lots of different speeds and reclines nicely for younger babies. I haven't used it since."
2,Another Mistake by Me,"Again, Graco has let me down and the reviews have left me wondering why this product received 4 stars. The swing is dirty! It came out of the box (new) with marks all over it. It was a pain to put together ...the tray doesn't latch properly ...the fabric is stiff ...the mobile is worthless (it doesn't attach properly either and unless the baby is extending his neck waaaaay back, there's no way he could see it) and it's simply not soft enough. I will have to either take it back (not likely with everything else a new mom has to contend with) or make/buy a cover for the seat, so the baby is comfortable. I wouldn't have bought this if I had seen it in person. I trusted the reviews, something I won't be doing again (this is the second Graco product I bought without seeing because of good reviews) Now I have the joy of opening our Pack-N-Play by Graco and putting it together ...we'll give it a chance, but I'm not holding my breath :)"
4,A Life Saver if You need a moment with hands free,My son uses the swing daily and likes it. We use the fastest speed and it calms him down when he is really tired.This is easy to collapse for storage and was easy to assemble. I did it in less than 45 minutes. The directions are pretty clear.Easy to take off the fabric for frequent washing.My son is 16 weeks and not really into the mobile but I am sure he will be soon enough.The batteries have also seemed to last forever.This is another great product by Graco.
3,This swing has it's ups and downs,"We registered for this swing with out really knowing what we wanted, or what was good. The swing was easily put together and works well. Over all it is a good swing. My baby likes it as well as a couple of others who have visited the house and used it. There are a few problems with it which is why I didn't give it a higher rating.Pros:- My baby loves it and enjoys watching the mobile.- Nice variation in speeds for younger versus older babies.- seat is comfortable for all sizes and ages (so far, the oldest baby put in there has been 8 months)Cons:- The tray doesn't open easily and if the baby is asleep it tends to wake them up when you are getting them out.- There are no lights, and the mobile doesn't move."
4,Easy way to calm your baby,"We don't use this swing all the time since the baby falls alseep from the rocking motion (then he won't sleep a lot at night, that's all). But, if you need to put the kid down for a bit while you do some stuff around the house, or if they are being cranky or fighting sleep then the swing is great.We have never had any battery problems or trouble closing the latch. In fact I keep waiting for our batteries to die, but they keep going.The only complaint I have is that the seat positions need more intervals. We usually put it halfway between reclining and sitting because even though our son can sit up, if he falls asleep he slumps forward."
4,Really neat,"AT first when you look at this swing, you don't think much of it. But once you start messing with it, you find all thse neat things about it. I like the fact that the seats can be adjusted for infant use and the dash can be removed easly. The swing setting is really neat but-the music is kind of robotic. It's not mellow and relaxing. But still it plays different tunes. The mobile doesn't swing or move but- the toys on the dash are great for older infants...although not so great for smaller infants. They would get a great scare of the noise. But over all, I'd give 4 stars."
4,Overall Satisfied,I purchased this swing since my son loves to be rocked back and forth. The 6 speeds are great because he liked the slower ones when he was younger and he likes the fast one now. The timer is a nice function but I don't use it because he wakes up if the swing stops. The different reclining positions are a must have. My son takes a nap in his swing with the chair fully reclined and he loves it. This swing has been a lifesaver for me because it gives me time to get other things done.
4,Basic guide,"I have not seen the book yet, as it was delivered to a relative. I will not see it for another month. Therefore I can't really write a review, but I would think it will be fine."
3,Upbeat story of a family tradition,"This book offers an upbeat story of one family's tradition of having Gramma prepare the matzo ball soup for Passover seder. Gramma shows up at the door with her special soup pot, and her favorite grand-daughter pitches in to help. Unfortunately, the story is cluttered with a lot of family members, dropping by to snatch a matzo ball out of the pot. And, the book fails to offer any religious meaning to the holiday -- the ""Rugrats Passover"" does a much better job at this. Comparing a lumpy matzo ball to the full moon at Passover seder is a bit of a stretch, and added little to the story. In short, my 3 yr old son found this book un-interesting. It lacks the warmth and enthusiasm of a similar book about a little girl spending the night at her grandfather's house: ""Everything from A to Z....,"" which my son memorized from cover-to-cover within a week after the book arrived."
5,light and water proof,Like this product for the price!! My rabbits use this and it is big enough for them to be able to go and arrange the chips and not spill over the edge
3,Not good for development,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos. He LOVED it! What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make. However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it. It was beyond his developmental path. Cute toy, but I'm not sure it's worth it."
4,My 6 month old loves the crinkly crab!,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old. I don't really think she's old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them! I've noticed that she likes ""crinkly"" toys, so she loves the crab. So far, it has kept her very entertained. I really like Lamaze products so far"
5,The child learns about tranquility at a young age,My first fish bowl by learning curve comes across as an excellent toy for a child coming of age to understand the wonderful creations of Mother Nature. Besides being associated with the environment it should also be seen as the first steps towards inculcating a sense of tranquility and peace. A definite buy even if this is to be viewed as a mere tool to keep your child busy for endless hours.
2,Looks good....limited fun,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother. I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy. Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old. He is now 9 months. He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else. I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers."
3,tlyonker,"This toy is very cute and my boys love to throw the fish around and lose them whenever possible. Like I said, it is cute and very durable, but not too educational. And the price is pretty high for something cute."
5,Great Toy A lot of Fun,"This is a fun toy that can be played with several different ways. Each sea animal is fun by itself, each one has a different texture and sound and is fun to chew on too. They area also enjoyable to put in and take out of the fish bowl. The clear softness of the fish bowl is great for babies. My son loved this toy and got a lot of use out of it. I would highly reccommend it and will probably give this as a gift in the future."
2,Maybe not for older babies?,"I read all the very positive reviews and bought the toy for my 10 month old girl. She played with it a little bit, but got bored with it very soon. Maybe she is already too old for it?"
3,A little too expensive for what it is,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old. He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn't seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl. However, he will take them out if they are in there. My son is very active, so maybe that's contributing to why he doesn't really use the bowl..."
2,Too Difficult for Purpose Described,It is impossible to get the objects in and out of the fishbowl unless you are Tarzan. Certainly not for very young children.
3,"Good, not great","I wanted to like this one more, but several things... the small binding made it a pain to keep open (while cooking). The recipes were ok...just well... I have several others I will use more. This was one of those cases of I wish I had seen it in the bookstore before buying... not a ""bad"" cookbook, just not a ""great"" one either....was expecting so much more potential to this topic..."
2,Background Information; No Followthrough,"This book is strong on background material and demonstrating why children are teased. ""Mom They're Teasing Me"" is chocked full of examples of children (usually with poor social skills) being teased. However, this book is weak on the issue most concerning anyone who would buy it. Specifically, the author does not offer advice on what to do if your child is being teased. Most of this book comes down to the following statement: children with poor social skills are teased. The authors's solution: read the book, ""Helping the Child Who Doesn't Fit In."" Personally, I think the author's premise is overly simplistic, but that other book does appear to be worth trying.The bottom line is, when you've read this entire book, won't have an answer to ""Mom, They're Teasing Me."""
4,Fishermen: Read this before you go to the BWCAW,"This book always goes in my pack. It has a listing of most lakes in the BWCAW and Quetico that gives you size of the lake, species of fish in the lake, and relative amount of fishing pressure, among other things. It also has a chapter for each major species of fish. Also valuable is the step-by-step procedure for cleaning fish."
1,outdated,nice cover but the book is outdated do not waste your cash author should not be so secretive about where the good fishing is
5,boundary waters fishing guide,"I found this book very informative and helpful, the author is definitely familiar with the boundary waters. I being a novice fresh water fisherman would liked to have seen pictures of the fishing tackle he was describing to catch certain fish."
3,A Comprehensive Guide,"Having known little about Russia, let alone the workings of its political systems, I was amazed at how easy the book was to read. It was simple, to the point, and yet not lacking in its own in-depth analysis. This I would recommend for students, people whom like me, want something fast and easy. There are even maps, so in case someone gets bored with words, there are always national boundaries to consider."
2,can't find the drivers,"The product appears to be a genuine samsung cable, so they were right on with that. I have yet to find any of the drivers available online (or on Samsung's site) though, so I can't use the thing. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Useless Item,"I could not find the drivers anywhere for this Samsung cable, including the Samsung site, and it won't work without them on my Samsung M610 phone. I called Sprint and they said the cable should be plug n play, but it isn't. Don't buy it."
5,Works Perfectly,"This oil cap works great and is definitely worth its price. Having lost the stock oil cap I was worried a new one might be expensive, but then I found this one and it works just as good as the stock one."
4,good product,i have chippewa boots and i work ona farm so i knew they would get dried out and/or lose their water resistance. i purchased this in order to avoid these issues and so far its has worked- i put one coat the first time and it literally only worked for a week. two coats seems to work much better- it does darken the color of the boot but i dont care. i also used this on a ducati(dainese) leather jacket i have and it made it really shiney im hoping that goes away. Between the jacket and the three total coats ive put on the boots i probably have enough for two more coats on whatever garmet- i will buy this again
1,"""mink"" oil","Does not contain mink oil, despite the ""mink oil"" label. I demand juiced minks in my mink oil! I think that's a reasonable stance."
5,12 years of daily use,"I've had this cuttig board for 12 years. It sits on the counter between my sink and my stove top. I use it as a counter top as well as a cutting board. I've carved on it, butchered on it, repaired appliances on it, set hot pans on it, spilled all manner of stuff on it, and I wouldn't trade it for any other. I do have the perfect space for this board, and the catch tray is a great idea; I don't know what I'd do without it. I prepare 15 to 20 meals a week on this board.I oil it when I remember, clean it with a wipe down or soap and water as needed. It has stayed acceptably attractive, and is just as functional as the day I got it. I recommend this cutting board for heavy use."
4,Excellent Cutting Board Workstation,This is a very well constructed board that includes a place to catch your scrap (very convenient). We use the board daily and are very satisfied with it. My only comments is the board could have been sanded a little smoother. The sides still have a rough finish to them. I'm sure this will smooth out over time.
2,Great concept but bad execution,The concept is good and practical. But the cutout is rough. You can even see all the wood fibers around the edges of the cutout. They didn't smoothen or even trim the edges. The material itself is made of cheap wood and it's quite rough. No sanding was done which makes the surface feel like plywood. That is not good for your knives. It feels cheap. Definitely not walnut. Could be poplar or beech (no mention in the description) which is a softer hardwood. Next time shop in a local store. Buying it sight unseen from Amazon was a risk. I'm keeping it because I like the concept of having the tray (also got it because of the 3-for-4 deal and Amazon credited me $20). The novelty will probably not last because the quality is not up to par.
3,Gets The Job Done,"I like the cut 'n catch feature of this board. It's a good idea to place something like that in a cutting board, and you'll find that it saves you lots of time in the kitchen. If you are buying it simply for the board and don't care about the cut 'n catch feature, I wouldn't get this board, since there are plenty of good boards already the market with superior cutting features."
2,Kinda blah.,"I heard some samples of Magnitude 9's music on a website somewhere and was very enthusiastic to buy Decoding the Soul. But after a few listens to the entire CD I was just disappointed. The whole album sort of drags and just left me flat. Not a bad album, just ho-hum."
4,Great starter audio interface,"This is the first audio interface I've used and it is pretty good. Lots of input/output options for various devices. I'm using it with a microphone, a guitar, and a MIDI keyboard and it works perfectly on Mac OS X with Logic Pro. There's some minor issues with the firewire interface as unplugging it usually crashes the comp, but it's not that big of a deal. Great way to start recording onto your computer.Pros:- Wide range of input/output jacks. Optical/MIDI are great.- Instant compatibility with OS X core audio drivers.- Fast firewire connection.Cons:- Touchy firewire interface.- Moderately expensive."
1,Amazingly Frustrating,"I bought an FA-66 with the hope of recording off my laptop, a dell Inspiron 5150. Recording sounded great and would work fine for about 10 minutes, and then it would start to ""skip"" and the sound would get distorted. I fussed with my system settings for a week and called tech support. They told me to buy a new firewire card and more RAM (I had 512 mb). So I bought a gig of RAM and a new firewire card and the problem was not fixed. I called again and they told me that maybe it just wouldn't work with my computer and that I should buy a new computer, dedicated to recording. That is to say, their tech support is essentially worthless. If you want something reliable (or something that works), do not buy this product."
5,Art & Craft of Natural Dyeing,"I've seen it referred to so often by other craft people, so thought I really should have a copy. It's an excellent resource and I refer to it often in my own research and experience with natural dyes - including indigo."
4,Excellent resource,"I think this is an under used, perhaps even unknown book on the war of the Revolution and its impact on American society. Thesis and conclusions are much clearer than a lot of Don Higginbotham's work. IT IS NOT AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES AND LEADERS OF THE WAR! Its social history, done well. It is in the ""new"" military history genre, and is nicely written, and well documented. Price is steep though, unfortunately."
3,"THC Marijuana Dip Test ""ok"", nothing special",I'm glad to have them. So far I come up positive every test and I'm not sure why. I think I might order some of the 3 or 5 multi drug tests because they seem more professional and possibly give me a more accurate result. These are just kind of cheap. They might be spot-on accurate but the cheapness and simplicity of them give me the feeling the quality is not that good.
1,Dont Work...cheaply made,"I used the kind with the plastic lid from cara care and they were awesome. Results in seconds and very accurate from my usage and non usage of thc. These ones are very cheap, the strips come apart and they are not accurate. I too tested water when I got a negative result after not smoking for a long time and even the water didn't show up negative. Going with the heavy plastic ones that have the lid. I believe its from cara care."
4,Halloween who dun it,"This story had some really funny lines in it, which I am a sucker for humor. Really would like to give it 4 & 1/2 stars.This is the story of a true crime mystery writer who has been out of the country and get an invitation from a cousin a year later. Lots of confusion. He shows up at what he thinks a murder mystery who dun it weekend party. Not knowing he is a year late he enters the inn which is now a B&B; run by Gwen. He ends up getting knocked out and doesn't remember who he is for a while and his cousin pulls a prank on him. Lots of laughter worth the cost"
5,Learn Italian at an affordable price!!,"I looved Italian Deluxe Instant Immersion! It has 5 cd-rom's for learning Italian on the computer (software), plus another 3 for the CD player to listen to in the car, at work, or at home! It's perfect for me because sometimes I'm too busy to get on the computer and actually sit down and work on my Italian, but the CD's allow me a different option so I can learn faster, just pop them in the CD player and repeat! Plus, its sooo affordable!! I'm definitely very pleased with this product, and I consider it a great investment.As for the comment regarding the instructions for the DVD, it doesn't have any, but it works well, its pretty easy to figure out and I've had no problem with it, and its not too large a program so that it slows the computer or anything, it works perfectly on my 3-year-old Dell laptop!I recommend pairing this purchase with the following workbook:Italian Now!: A Level One Worktextto practice writing in Italian as well!Buona fortuna!"
4,"Simple, but Inspiring Self-Help","I read this book while in the middle of making some life changes. The book helps in keeping focus on what is truly important. I like the simplicity and the ""workbook"" format to answer questions and make the book more like a journal. I found many of the quotes inspirational.Much of the book is things we know, but that we don't live. Many of the concepts are in conflict with what we hear and see everyday in mainstream society. I would suggest reading the book to remind yourself that the potential doesn't lie out there...it lies inside each one of us."
5,Better Than The Board Game!!,"I liked the earlier PC video game version of A & A, but this new game rocks in my opinion! I find it fun and entertaining. Who cares if it isn't like the board game - it's fun in it's own right!!"
1,Axis & Allies ( Atari New Release),"I love playing the old board game, and playing Hasbro's CD-ROM game is exciting on the internet. Regrettably, I just received the new release of the Atari version of A&A for 49.99. I BELIEVE THE NEW GAME IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, AND ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. THE DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO PLAY THE GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND. THE NEW GAME IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME, AND A POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME. I'M PLANNING TO RETURN THE GAME TO GAMESTOP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
3,Not the board game !,"Reading the previous reviews many have rated it bad because people are expecting something like the board game. If you read the comments it says ""INSPIRED BY THE BOARD GAME"" It does not say exactly like the board game.I have the board game and I love it, Whenever we can get a group of people we play.This PC version is great it has great graphics ""smoke, construction, fires, explosions, ect. ect.""It is pretty cool on how the construction is portrayed.The battlefields and the missions get harder and harder.Overall if you are expecting a board game do not buy this get the board game. If you are looking for a PC game with great graphics then buy this game."
1,This Game Sucks,I loved the A&A board game and I was really looking forward to the computer version. This was a total disapointment. I felt like I was being forced to play a hybrid between Risk and Warcraft-- at least all the BAD parts of those games. This bears ABSOLUTELY NO RESEMBLANCE to the old board game. Do not buy this if you liked the old A&A.
2,allies ain't so allied,"so, you're in charge of the ENTIRE theatre of europe right? No, wait, you're in charge of a corps, no you command the theatre again. Oh, yeah, by the way, you can only attack in ONCE every turn. The OBVIOUS bugs in this game clearly stem from the messy marriage of real-time and turn based strategy gaming. Ya know, I wish AH would, program a goddamned game that plays like one of their board games, and just settle for selling it for $10 or $5. unless, of course we're talkin about Squad Leader, now THAT game would sell. But I digress, in short save your nickels and buy some other turkey."
3,Good,"A good overall game to play if you are looking for basic stratigic gameplay. However, if you are looking for a hardcore Roelplaying or stratigic game this is not the one to go for.Good game for the younger crowds or pre-teen or younger to play."
3,Fire in the Hole,"It was the best time I've ever had screaming my head off at the apparent boredom I was suffering. Even though the graphics are outdated when compared to most recent RTS games(and compared to other games when it was released), the graphics do add a sort of vintage/authentic look to the era. The main problem that this games suffers from is that the only way to win is to zerg(get a whole bunch of units and overrun the enemy with numbers). I love the general powers that are unique to each general but usually have very little effect on the outcome of the battle. The ""Conquer the World"" free form campaign is boring, you don't even need tactics, just attack and reinforce and all is good."
1,What a Waste!,"This game is a total waste. Whoever thinks it is a five out of five must not have played it. Maybe if it was ten dollars, it might just reach the level of fair, but it's horrible. I played it for a day, and won every campaign using both all the allied and axis nations within a few hours. The idea of winning by merely capturing the capital is a big mistake, and there is no way that you should be able to take Russia out of the game using germany in two turns. The producers should add more territories and units to the game. However, even then it will still be well below most turn-based strategy games."
1,"Poor support, game did not work",This is the last Atari game I will buy. Their tech support is horrible. The games never work properly.
2,Entertaining but...,Fun to play (I don't use the RTS option as it drags out games) as it is partially reminiscent of the old board game. But two faults limit enjoyment and realism: 1) Computer-run players in the one player mode aren't quite smart enough (the Russian army will move to occupy open space rather than concentrate forces in protecting its capital) and 2) there are no naval units whatsoever unlike the board game. naval units made the game so much more realistic in that it made Germany's ability limited as the U-boat fleet dwindled and made the US-Japan pacific battle so much more interesting. This game completely ignores the navy...too bad. I did enjoy however the battle previews which examine unit stats and probabilities of victory prior to battle.
3,Pictures Galour!,"This cutting board is a nice piece of 'art'. The picture on the board features some old-fashioned receipes. This cutting board's main purpose seems to be to look good, rather than being effective to use as a cutting board. It has grooves in it to keep juices, however, that tends to make things messy. Looks good - performs so-so."
4,"Large, tough, and sturdy","I must say I was pleasently surprised when I got this board. I just replaced a Farberware board that I have had for about 11 years, it finally split after 11 years of dropping it between my range and our cabinets (its normal storing place).This board is larger by about 1"" on each side. I like the rubber stoppers on the bottom that elevate the board off the counter. They do well as nonstick stoppers as well.This board is strong. My daughter has decided to use it as an imaginary surf board to my chagrine. She also enjoys the pictures on the board.The only problem with the board might come if space is an issue. The larger dimensions and the rubber stoppers do make the board more difficult to store.All in all I look forward to at least 10 years of service from this board."
1,False advertising - Misleading,"The Amazon.com page for this items states ""Item count says 100 and a shipping weight says 6 pounds"". The picture shows a box of pig ears. I ordered and recieved ""1"" pig ear with shipping cost almost $7.00. Complete rip off! This is false advertising at its worse and now they want to charge me shipping to return my $7.00 pig ear. I will be filing a complaint with BBB to protect others on Amazon.com from being ripped off like this."
4,Pig Ear purchase #2,"I would like to know why my order went to White Dog Bone and not KNine Kountry. The buyer should be notified ""prior to placing the order"" that their order is not going to the company that they had intended. The pig ears from White Dog Bone are not as well prepared as the ones I received from KNine Kountry. I have to wipe each one off before feeding it to my dogs."
1,I was ripped off,"When I purchased this item it was listed as 100 pig ears, I thought I was getting a real great deal. I got one pig ear and paid almost $9.00 in shipping costs. This is outrageous. Even the picture shows a box of pig ears but today the item is not available and has no description."
5,As Irish as plastic can be,"I gave this to my wife to add to her small but eclectic Barbie collection (plus she does a lot for the local Irish festival, so it's a win-win). It still has Barbie's ridiculous feet, but other than that it's one of the more attractive releases. The face doesn't have the vacant smile. The hair is pretty. The dress is oh-so-screamingly trademark Irish...but that matches the costumes you see at a real feis. A doll to play with? Nah. That hair will unravel and tangle in a heartbeat. A doll to collect and appreciate? You betcha. It looks great with the rest of her collection."
4,Perfect for the Irish dancer!,"Other than her hair not staying in those perfect, bouncy curls, my daughter just loves this doll!"
3,Prompt and courteous,The doll was shipped almost as soon as the order was received. Shipper emailed me when they received the order and when they shipped it out. Would recommemd this buisness.
5,Oh!,"How pretty? The curls are so shiny, and her expression is so adorable. Her outfit looks like velvet, and her shoes and stockings are so cute! I definitely want this doll!-Horse-Crazy"
2,Ok spinger.,"Not too happy with this gun. First gun from Cybergun I'm not happy with.Holds a massive amount of bb's, but has horrible accuracy.Strength is 'ok', and the metal parts of the stock break easy.It does fine in little ""backyard wars"" but isn't really worth the trouble."
2,Broke quickly,"I loved it, while it lasted. Mine did not take long to split right down the middle. It's a great idea, but poorly executed."
1,Cracks After Only One Month's Use,"Very disappointing !This adjustable wood over-the-sink cutting board replaced a similar board purchased over thirty years ago that had moved with us from Philadelphia to New York to Hong Kong to New York to Chevy Chase, and that needed replacement only because one of the adjustable arms finally broke -- the cutting board itself was still fine.The new board, which we carefully seasoned with food-grade mineral oil as instructed, has cracked after only one month's use.What a waste. Catskill Craftsman should be ashamed."
3,"OK, depends on how big your sink is","Having a small kitchen sucks. I thought buying an over-the-sink board will help, but either my sink is too wide, or this thing sucks.The main problem is that the handles that extend from the board come out fairly easy, so while you're trying to balance the board and fitting the handles to the sink, you'll take them off completely. On my first attempt I thought I had the handles at the right length, but while cutting an onion, the whole thing crashed into the sink. I've become more careful after that, and it's been working fine, but setting it up is a little annoying, and I keep getting the handles out completely. The board itself is fine, by the way. No complaints there."
5,Great first toy for baby!,"My 3 month old daughter received these blocks for a Christmas gift and loves them. They are great because they are attached together so you don't have to worry about keeping track of each individual block. You can stretch them out into a straight line (which makes them a nice toy for baby while in an infant carrier-- you can stretch them across her lap for her to look at). They have a non-breakable mirror on one block which my daughter really enjoys. There is also a place on another block to insert a picture which I thought was a really neat idea. There is a ""handle"" on one block which makes for a nice teether. All blocks are very colorful and offer nice visual stimulation for a young baby. There is a ladybug that her wings lift up which is another favorite of my daughters. I would definately recommend this toy!"
2,I do like,works great. just remember to retighten the screws because they will loosen slightly afterwards sighting it in but works great from then on. Got 1 deer already!
3,Durabook is not what I expected,"The Durabook was sold in a package which was as upgradeable to MS Office Vista when Vista was released.There was a lot of web dialog about getting Durabook copies of Vista, to no ones avail.The machine seems very hot running in the bottom left rear corner.I had to put tape over the left side microphone next to the left side speaker. With my hand on the keyboard I was getting feedback squealing from the microphone right back into the speaker.I was surprised too that in this day and age, there is no bluetooth compatibility in the Durabook.For the price I paid eight months ago, the Durabook N15RI is less than I had hoped or expected. At the current Amazon price, it is competitive with equally priced Compaq, Dell, Sony,or Toshiba laptops. But, considering the response I got from Twinhead about Vista compatibility, I downrate their support and customer satisfaction."
3,Too thin to hide anything.,"While it may be acoustically invisible and seems durable, it is also so thin that you can see right through it. My intended application had been to hide A/V equipment, but you can see them clearly on the other side. Will have to try to find something else."
3,bulovar watch,"I like the look of the watch, but the problem is getting it off. It has such a difficult closure, that I can hardly get it on by my self. Its also had to find the open/ closure."
3,Birth Control - 'Getting There' (ZYX Music),"A surprisingly good 1998 Birth Control album. A little bit better than I guess I may have expected. Obviously not as happening as some of the early titles like 'Operation' ('70), 'Rebirth' ('73) or 'Plastic People' ('75) but still very decent. Did notice they have just one original member - drummer / vocalist Bernd Noske and occasional bassist Horst Stachelhaus who has been on a couple of Birth Control lp's here and there. Tunes I liked best were the heavily-played (so to speak) ""Garden Of Gold"" and ""Love Strike"" as well as the inspiring ""Simpler As It Seems"". Also dug the straight-forward rocker ""Hard Times"" with it's pumping organ. Perhaps they should now call this band Bernd Noske's Birth Control. Believe they put out one more proper CD following this one one. Although 'Getting There' is certainly nothing special, it's still okay."
5,More than fifty delicious recipes,"The Usborne Children's Cookbooks is packed from cover to cover with wonderfully illustrated, thoroughly ""kid friendly"", easy-to-make, palate pleasing, appetite satisfying recipes that children can prepare in the family kitchen. From Spicy Bean Soup; Bacon and Onion Quiche; Chile Con Carne; and Chicken Stir-Fry; to Ratatouille with Butter Bean Mash; Oven-Baked Salmon; Fluffy Lemon Cheesecake; and Raspberry Cream Puffs, each of the more than fifty delicious recipes are nicely laid out with easy-to-follow, illustrated, step-by-step instructions. Enhanced with basic ingredient information, practical cooking tips for everything from using a food processor to whisking cream, to thickening sauces, The Usborne Children's Cookbook will quickly prove to be as family favorite for children aspiring to enjoy themselves in the kitchen by helping to make a family meal. Highly recommended!"
4,Kid Cooking,I am going on my daughters reaction to this book. She loved it! She is 8 and has made a couple of the recipes without help. It has taught her quite a few valuable lessons and boosted her self esteem!
5,Amazing book,"Everyone who I have ever shown this book to has had a deep reaction to it. I wouldn't handicap this book by calling it a photography book alone, although the photos are very powerful and prominent, but the text deserves recognition as well. Plenty of personal stories of how people made this decaying city their home. Both epic and intimate. A testament of the human animal's ability to adapt and thrive. Thank god the authors got in to Kowloon before its destruction to create this book.Also, as a side note: Any artist wanting reference material for decaying urban sprawl, look no further. This book makes for great city or science fiction reference, with unbelievable details (electrical boxes, pipes, hallways, stairwells, etc...)"
2,Cost too much,"For the price, I could have purchased a lot of good books. The quality of the pictures wasn't as good as I expected."
4,"More than just a book on ""helpers.""","I expected creation rules, templates and powers for Kinain, the humans with fae blood in the World of Darkness. I got it. But, this book goes into the way that glamour affects the day to day life of the changling. It explains how the dreaming can affect mortals and how the Kithain deal with them. It's an exellent sourcebook if you need to populate your world with dreams and dreamers."
5,One of the best all year!!!,"I picked this book up at the store without really looking closely at it. And let me tell you, I couldn't put it down. Really showed me that what seems like the strongest, most perfect relationship, has it's ups and downs, and that you can survive...if you're willing to try! I am recommending this book to all my friends!"
3,The only one I could find.,"Arrived in good condition. Shipping was excessive in price (just as much as the product), and very slow."
4,A wonderful picture book,"This book is an excellent depiction of a few children and their lives on the island of Dominica. It's a great book for kids wishing to learn more about this ""Nature Island"". I just wish it was longer!!!!"
5,Impressed,"Very impressed with the mouse. Desktop movement is excellent, gyroscope movement takes a little getting used to, but not much at all.I would recommend geting the refurbished model. I would not have been able to tell it was refurbished if it weren't for the sticker on the box. The product looks new and works perfectly. My only concern with a refurb model is the battery life, but it seems fine so far so I guess will just have to wait and see.Great deal on a great product."
3,tool kit,"This is a wonderful and useful little tool kit for a woman to keep in the house. Multipul tips for the screwdriver, hammer, tape measure. and much more that every housewife usually has to go hunting through the garage for. This is very handy to have under the kitchen sink or laundry room shelf"
2,Not Great,"I was desperate for a book on windows clustering so this one looked pretty good. The first part deals with concepts and it is pretty good. The second part shows how to build the cluster and if you are into file&print, then it really stinks. There is barely anything but screenshots of the wizard."
2,"Nice weight and shape, but get's dull quickly","This Victorinox 8-inch Carving Knife is a nice weight and shape, but it didn't seem all that sharp right from the beginning. Within a few uses, it seemed to get even duller. I didn't think I was going to have to sharpen it any time soon, but I was definitely wrong. I've bought 3 Victorinox knives trying to save money, but they all have the same issue. I wouldn't recommend this brand. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Best Leather Conditioner for your car,"This is an outstanding leather conditioner that I've been using routinely on the seats in my Infiniti M35x. The car is 4 years old, is driven daily and all the leather seats look like new. No cracks, stains, spots. The leather has remained quite soft. The fragrance this product leaves in the card is very nice, you'll be tempted to apply it for that reason alone. Kind of like freshly shined shoes. Really a 5 star product that I initially purchased based on strongly positive automotive web site reviews that were obviously quite correct. It is a bit expensive but I think it is worth the investment."
2,Not Excited,The product went on nicely but I ruined the nice new car smell. I thought it smelled like NO. 2 pencil erasers. Also thought it made my brand new leather seat feel still and like plastic rather then the smooth softness they used to be before I applied this. I'm sad I spent all the money on the product. I've been using ArmorAll Leather Car gel on my wife's Tacoma for the past four year years and the seats look and smell great. More expensive isn't always better.
3,Missing items?,"The board itself is fine, but the box says it includes 6 darts which were not in the box. It was also missing the mounting hardware. I gave it as a gift so I was embarrassed and disappointed."
4,"Love the ""lip""....wish it were taller!","""happy review warrior"" obviously doesn't have children, or he/she would appreciate the ""lip"".This lazy susan is very well made, sturdy, and looks great on my table. My only complaint with this item, is that the lip isn't high enough. [sorry happy review warrior!]"
2,"Lip? We don't need no stinkin' ""lip""!","The only problem with this finely crafted lazy-susan is that it has a lip. If you don't know much about lazy-susans, or haven't thought about it, and are considering getting one, recognize that a lip is a bad thing. Basically, it limits what can be placed on it.Do you want to balance a 20-inch serving tray on it? The lip will make the tray dip. This is true of anything larger than the given diameter. It will especially annoy you if you wish to use it to ice a cake, as the center may dip, and crack the cake.Lazy susans are designed primarily as a convenient rotating table. Trying to incorporate the serving tray into it is unnecessary foolery. It will also make it more difficult to clean up, as using a separate tray, as is normally done, means you only have to wash the tray, and not the heavy wooden lazy susan.Trust me, lazy susans don't come with lips for good reason. Don't fall prey to ignorance. Go get the real thing."
4,Stuff they forgot to teach us,"Well, I had this book way back when it was first published and lost it.I had thought it was out of print but, as usual, Amazon came through.This is an amazing book. I would venture to say that anyone who has any question about American History would find this a valuable resource.I would recommend this book to those who want to brush up on American History. I would also recommend it to those who find the little facts of history fascinating."
3,"Good content, but the commentary is way off","I became interested in the Gospel of Thomas while reading The Goaspel of Jesus by Stephen Mitchell. That book was very solid form top to bottom, but this book is a struggle. The insights of the author detract from the message of the sayings of Jesus. I found myself disagreeing strongly with the take of the commentary and finally just skipping it entirely. I would not recommend this book; find another source for the gospel of Thomas."
1,It split on me too!,I saw the reviews before I bought it but I thought those people had possibly been careless. I apologize to them... mine split in less than 3 weeks of use and I did everything I was supposed to. Just the steam from a regular pasta cooking kitchen split it. It was beautiful but obviously it was defective. Amazon has been good about taking it back and I'm assuming I will have no problem getting my refund.
2,Split within a year,"I purchased this block in Dec. 2002. We moved into our new home in January 2003 and this block split in two places by the end of 2003. We treated it exactly as it says - lots of mineral oil and only occasional washing. Disappointing, now I am inclined to buy a thinner cutting board."
1,catskill craftmen,"please help me to get in touch with you, i bought this item on dec 5, 2000, there is a big split in it now i was under the inpression this board would last, please help, and take care of this for me thank you amy reichbach"
1,Another one bites the dust,"Mine lasted a little longer than some of these others, but I still haven't gotten the use out of it I'd expected. It developed a 4 inch long crack along a seam after 3 yrs. Very disapointing, and judging by the other comments a common cause of failure.Yes, this cutting board looks great and is wonderful to use, but bottom line: it failed after 3. Buy something else!"
1,Mine Split Also - Forewarned is Forearmed,"I purchased my Cutting Slab in early June 2003 and have enjoyed using it. However, in late September it developed a major 3 inch split along the edge. Seems like since there have been a number of failures you should discountinue carrying this item and offer us a refund.WHAT SHOULD I DO?"
2,"Cracked, less than a year","When I got the board, I oiled it regularly. The problem is, it's so big and heavy, it's hard to clean. So it gets VERY little use. Today I went to move it, and it's cracked. Fault of the board? Probably not. Fault of the owner? Probably. But be warned! If you are slack on maintencance, you'll pay."
5,Rock solid!,"Great looking. Perfect size. Spendy? Yes, but worth it. You'll pass this one on to your grandchildren. I love a cutting board that carries some weight. This is an extremely stable board when set on a damp towel."
5,Catskill slab,"I have had this board for years. It has been a great purchase. The board is very thirsty when you receive it, simple mineral oil will cure this.It is available at wally world for under $2 in the pharmacy area. You should buy several bottles, there is a lot of wood to treat. I have no cracks or wood separations, use the board, sanitize it and dry it. Simple care will make this board last forever. I am thoroughly pleased with it."
4,Love my new chopping block!,"I have to say, I was worried about ordering this chopping block after reading the feedback, but decided to take the chance. So far I have no complaints, I'm loving it and use it every day-treating it as suggested I hope that it will last a lifetime."
1,Generic Hepa Filter,"I ordered this hepa filter because the web site states ""PN-60285 Eureka Vacuum Cleaner HEPA Replacement Filter by Eureka"". This product is sold by MoreQualityLessMoney and fulfilled by Amazon. The actual product sent was a generic filter made by EnviroCare that is not a genuine Eureka product. This filter may or may not work as well as the genuine product, I have no way of knowing because I sent it back for a refund. Amazon has a great return policy. Had I known that a generic filter would be sent, I could have ordered the same product from a different company and saved a few dollars in the process."
4,PN-60285 Eureka Vacuum Cleaner HEPA Replacement Filter,"Just like its original filter it works fine, only problem i might have with this is the bright orange color sticking out back of my vacuum cleaner. Nothing to be dealt with , just turn away ur vacuum cleaner when not in use , Cheers :)"
2,May not be HEPA,"Not a direct replacement. Filter is missing the first layer that faces the vacuum, which is like a thin sheet of rice paper over the face of the filter.I doubt it is even up to HEPA standards. Do not buy."
5,incredible and original,"Rock critics keep comparing Nathan to Tom Waits. While Wiley is an incredibly talented singer, songwriter and musician, the comparison seems to be an example of writers being too lazy to describe something on its own merit. This music is ecclectic but not all over the board. There's bluesy rock, and a slight hint of country without being redneck. The lead track and first video ""Bottom Dollar"" dives right in and takes you for a smokey surreal ride. There's a slight hint of Waits-like vocals here, but it doesn't come up again for the rest of the album. Other apparant influences throughout include classic rock staples like Dire Straits, Bob Seger, and maybe some Eagles. Overall, this debut is an incredible album, and I think Nathan is destined to go far. A must-have."
1,Bionicle:Matoran Adventures,My 7 year old son and I have had a very hard time with this game. We got through the 1st one with fun challenges but this one we can get past the beginning without major trouble. He hates it and won't play with it anymore.
2,Extremely dated methods of building a web site,"This book may be well written for younger folk entering the world of web design, but that's still no excuse for teaching the bad old ways of building web pages. There should be no place for font tags and table-layout in any modern webdesign book. And no mention of CSS defies belief. It is vitally important that new entrants in the world of web design - regardless of how young or old they are - are taught the correct way to build websites, ie. the application and philosophy of semantic HTML and Web Standards.I would definitely recommend all people learning to build websites for the first time to buy Ian Lloyd'sBuild Your Own Website The Right Way Using HTML & CSSinstead."
1,More junk for 2012 hysteria,"The writer calls his own book ""critically acclaimed"" but doesn't mention by whom. It purports the theory that there's another sun in our solar system with it's own planets, and that explains everything. The annunuki, 2012, our origins, and basically anything else he could think of that's unexplained. the war in Libya? Thanks, I'm good.People can't be this desperate.."
5,Wonderful,"Very, very nice. Forget the petty nitpicking, this is a GREAT book for people serious about using QBasic as a programming language. If it had a true introduction to QBasic for beginners it would be the one-stop-shop for the language. As it is, though, you need to be somewhat familiar in order to appreciate just how good this book is!"
2,"Authors know QBASIC, but don't know English","This book is entirely unsuitable for beginning programmers, and difficult to read even for experienced programmers. All the information is there, even on advanced topics, but the authors write in mock-Soviet Academese. There is also no reference appendix or any way to quickly look up commands (though QBASIC itself provides that). Here are a couple of sentences from the first paragraph in the book: ""Statements must be written according to QBasic syntax rules. Why, for example, is the comment text in the INPUT statement enclosed in quotation marks, and the variable name placed after the comma?"" This is gobbly-gook to anyone who doesn't already know alot about programming in general and BASIC in particular. It gets worse from there. Do not buy this book unless you are an experienced BASIC programmer looking for advanced info on QBASIC for DOS audio and graphics programming, and don't want or need any kind of useable quick-reference to the language."
4,Wall Liner Wallpaper,"We used this product to cover paneling in our livingroom. It worked well to cover the paneling, however, the directions say to [...] the paper at the seams and not to overlap it. I caution you to be careful to not pull it away at from the seams when pressing out the air bubbles as it will create a gap between the seams. This gap will show unless you fill it with something.Overall we are happy with the smooth finish it has created."
5,Easy to adjust,Works well and the best feature is that you can slide it around on the wall while it's still wet to get the seams to line up perfectly. I tried using wall liner that requires paste and never could get the edges to line up exactly. With this stuff it was no problem at all.
4,A must for wallpapering over cinder block.,Easy to work with and it is the first pre pasted liner that I have ever worked with. A must for wallpapering over cinder block.
3,Wacoal's quality changed?!,"Wacoal used to be my brand of choice. Then their bra sizing changed. NOw a usually loose, casual fit pantie size is too tight around & too long up & down. The lace used to be smooth, too & now it's rough & scratchy. Not a good thing for lingerie.Going back!"
5,Sexy Beautiful Comfortable Briefs,"These are very comfortable, sexy looking undies for a mature women. Don't show under leggings and form fitting pants. Are comfortable as the stay in place and don't pinch or bind anywhere. Very nice material of good quality. Expect to last a LONG time."
3,Not what it sounds like.,"This book should be called a listing of unusual sex practices.Its not a ""how to"" book for those who want to broaden their bedroom ativities.Having said that,the book does detail the unusual sex practises from around the world.It's an interesting book.There are illustrations but very few.Overall:average.If you're curious this book will be of interest."
3,When they say Encyclopedia they mean Encyclopedia,Use this as a reference guide to settle arguments with your friends or spouse because just trying to read it will be really difficult. It does cover any and everything will enough information to satisfy your curiosity and point you in the direction to find more.
4,I very interesting !,Very informative on what people do and possibly why they do it? A very interesting and informative book of different cultures and how they may prictice their beliefs and sexual practices.
1,Finish is rough and only a veneer,"I was very excited to get this board and have used it several times for making fresh pasta. The first thing I noticed was that it was very rough - as one other reviewer wrote - and oiling it did not help. The next thing that happened was that it warped. Lastly, I pulled it out the other day to discover that the wood is only a veneer and has started to peel. Cheaply priced and cheaply made."
4,Jonny says...,"I think this is an excellent product - esp. for the value. Williams-Sonoma has one for like 80 bucks, and it's better, but too expensive. For the price I am very pleased and would not trade it in for the WS model. I also like that it is made in NY state - more an more things today are made by people of other lands so it's nice to keep Americans working. This type of pastry board is very handy for making crusts - of which I make a lot. THe recipe on the board is what I use but I add 1 tsp of sugar and I usually use 1 stick of unsalted butter instead of all Crisco. People love my pies so I must be doing something right..."
5,Pastry board,I own aboard like this for years and I lost it in my move; I was thrill to be able to get a new one; the best board made. Susan Carver
1,"Poorly constructed, wood is not smooth","Poorly constructed out of bad wood. The surface of the wood is all rough, and little shavings coming up out of it that get in the food. I tried to sand it smooth, and treat it with oil, but it still keeps happening. Too bad, because supporting local companies is a good thing, but this place just let crap walk out of their door."
1,Unsatisfied,Very disappointed in this product. Rough service.When you rub your hands over the top tiny particals come off. Cannot use it.
2,pastry board,"I bought this board for my daughter for Christmas. She has not used it yet. What held her back was that the finish is VERY rough. She tried oiling it, but that did not help smooth out the finish."
4,"great board, wood feathered easily",bought this for my wife last christmas. she loves using it. the only complaint we have is that the wood feathers easily even after we oiled it after each handwash.
4,The craftsmanship is great,"The craftsmanship & size of this pastry board is better than I expected. It even comes with a basic pastry receipe in the center of the board. it has 3(8,9,10inch) sizes for pies. Standard and metric measurements. Now I will be able to make a better pie crust, I know I will definitly like it for my homemade noodles. It's sole purpose is for a pastry board not a cutting board. Yes it does need seasoned when you open it, there is a card included with packaging that tells you to season it before using. I cant wait to use it, but I have to season it first. I should of bought the conditioner when I purchased it but didn't, I recommend that you do. When I do use it, I will creat a new review. Thank you for your craftmanship and fast service. I'm like a kid in a candy store excited."
4,nice board,nice solid maple board with all the normal pastry lines. great for slicing dinner one one side and rolling out dessert on the other.
5,oldie but goodie,"I had this book as a toddler and loved it. So did my children. I am now looking for copies for grandchildren. It 'Judaizes' traditional mother goose rhymes to teach Jewish customs e.g. ""Mary Mary quite contrary/ how does your orchard grow?/ With fruit so sweet/ It'll be a treat/ And hang in a succah I know."" For a child who eats in a succah on Succot, this is delightfully relevant. I would not suggest it for a family where the kids do not associate 'apple dipped in honey' with the Jewish New Year.I would sugggest that they made a big mistake in putting it out in paperback. The kids who use it are little and are likely to want it reread to them many times."
4,Very Tough But Soft on Knife's Edge,"I got this board a year ago, and it still looks good on my counter. So far, I only had to add mineral oil twice in the year. I used it to chop heavy stuff, and it's very sturdy yet it has an excellent ""give"" on my $100s knife's edge. The only setback, is during cleaning time, it's very heavy (good way for weight-lifting exercise). If you chop a lot, and love your expensive knives, this is the only board you'd ever need for everyday chopping."
5,Round and Wonderful (Amazon),"This cutting board is round, and I just love, love, love it. I imagined it would be a great purchase from Amazon and it was! Amazon has done it again"
3,20% loss,"This stuff works swell but you can't get all of it out of the can, I use it for mold and odors and I have had about 2 dud cans out of 10, that's 20% of product you can't use. Ever since they went to aluminum the product dispenser failure rate doubled! Ask for the metal canister, the aluminum canisters just don't have the pressure to get the product out."
2,Ozium Review,"I find this product to be alright. It's no better or worse than other sprays out there. You spray it, it gets rid of the odor for a while, then you have to spray it again when the odor comes back. *shrugs*I won't reorder. I'll just buy whatever I can walk into a store and get and find on sale."
5,Best odorizing product,"Ozium has been used in my home for over 40 years it removes any forgotton smell..Ozuim removes all stingent smells that all other deoderizers only pushes it from oneside of the room to another..Yu can place this Product on the Dump site of Chicago or New York and your workers will think something good has happend because Ozium rids all and any odors as soon as it leaves the fountain of its nozzle..Its percentage rate is way and beyond all other household and resturant sprays..Smelling is believing or your money back guaranteed.Glenda Jasper, Colfax, Ca."
5,ozium air sanitizer,"As far as I can tell this is the real stuff. Works great. I use it on trying to keep smoke and other odors out of the room. The great thing about this product is that it doesn't mask the problems of odor, it corrects them. I highly recommend this product."
3,nearly as good as anticipated,The product is nearly as good as I had anticipated. I am bothered by the fairly long lingering after fragrance of citrus. But this is not to say that it is that way with all customers. Everey body of course wouldn't be bothered.But what really bothered me was the considerable delay in its delivery.
1,A messy pan,I had one of these boxes for years and it worked well. They changed the shape of the top which allowed stuff to land outside of the box. The picture shown on Amazon is the old box. Very disappointed.
1,Not as illustrated,"For those of you who have ordered this sifting litter pan system in the past: they have changed the design, what is pictured is the original . The new design has : swoops on the inside of the box, which makes it a very difficult pain in the butt to clean. I called van ness to inquire and complain and they confirmed that all of the currently sifting litter pans are of the new design and they have no plans to go back to the original design, even though they have been getting complaints. Interestingly, as of a few weeks ago they still had a picture of the original design up on their site. Too Bad the original design was great even though their instructions were wrong.Tim"
3,"Good, but could be better","I was looking for a book that I could use for ideas to use with my high school classes. The book was good for me, but not really useful for my students."
5,"excellent, focused book on the art of tailoring jackets","what i love about this book is the detailed instructions paired with detailed pictures and diagrams about how to construct a tailored jacket. every sewer knows that getting that perfect notch that lies flat is much more difficult than it seems. many other sewing books repeat the same tailoring information that you can find on the internet without going into the nitty gritty details of what cosntruction tricks result in that perfectly fitted tailored jacket. for example, this book shows how to clip and press seams around the notch (and in what direction) to get rid of that annoying little puff that can result from bulk. highly recommend!"
1,Tailoring by Creative Publishing,"This book is a re-packaged, re-marketed book previously published as a Singer sewing book on tailoring. With a new cover you might be fooled, as I was, to the tume of 18.84. The Singer sewing publication is available through Amozon.com for about $6.00 plus shipping. Do yourself a favor andshop around. Check out used book stores. BernieLearTailoring: The Classic Guide to Sewing the Perfect JacketTailoring: The Classic Guide to Sewing the Perfect Jacket"
5,Tailoring: The Classic Guide to Sewing the Perfect Jacket,This book is wonderful! Very in depth - full details with lots of pictures demonstrating techniques.
3,Good for women's tailoring,"This book is good if you only want to do women's tailoring and is limited to jackets only, no tailored pants. It has clear images and provides good examples of basic techniques you need to have to be able to make a decent jacket - how to grade seams, deal with bulky darts, pad-stitching and importantly, how to properly press a garment.It also provides you with alternative technqiues - whether you want to machine make the whole thing with glue interfacing, custom make the garment with hair canvas or half/half.This book is comprehensive enough for a sewer with high or intermediate-high skills.The pictures are very good but some things are better learnt through demonstrations such as - welt pockets - that section for me was more a refresher rather than a lesson on how to."
4,Great Tips,"I'm not a very experienced tailor but I alreay know a lot of tips and methods of sewing. This book is basically about HOW to sew not only a good jacket, but all garments."
5,Copy of the Singer Reference Library,This Book is the best Book ever produced in regards to Tailoring with step by step instructions and lots of Pictures to follow. However I was hoping that this would be a different kind of Book than the one I already own. This is a reprint of the Singer Reference Library Book about Tailoring which was published in 1988. I was looking for this Book for many Years and I am glad to know that another Publisher seem to have aquired the rights to the Singer Books.
2,Dark LCD,I purchased this camera about 2 weeks ago and decided to return it. The LCD is very dark and its almost impossible to see what you are taking a photo of when you are inside the house. I compared it to others at the store before returning it. It had about the darkest LCD in the there...I do think it takes good pictures for the most part. I just thought if I couldnt see them what was the point?
2,Cannot take indoor pictures at all!,"I have had this camera for a few years now and while it takes beautiful outdoor pictures, no matter what season it is, I have never been able to take any kind of decent indoor picture. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I am upgrading to a Kodak Easyshare camera."
4,My First,This was my first digital camera. Very easy to use. No problems downloading images. Glad to Support Breast Cancer Awareness.
1,awful camera,"This camera is terrible. The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldnt give it zero. I was going to buy myself a good camera but my mother-in-law got me this camera for christmas. When your inside the flash is too bright, when your outside its too dark, and of course you cant use the flash outside because then its really bright. lame. luckily i have a good camera now. The only good thing about this camera is it raises awareness to help breast cancer research."
1,Terrible Camera,I bought 2 of these as gifts for Christmas. The picture quality was horrible. The pictures all have an orange hue to them. The LCD is so dark you can not even make out what you are taking a picture of. I was expecting a lot more for a camera from polaroid. I have actually bought 2 new cameras to replace these because i feel guilty for giving such crappy gifts to my family!!!!
2,cow timer,"The Good: the company sent me a free replacement very quickly for the damaged one I received. The timer is cute.The Bad: lousy alarm, do not buy this if you care about actually using it as a timer with an alarm.The Ugly: a littly dorky looking."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed of the quality of the product. The item is hand painted but it doesn't look good, it looks like dirty and careless, the timer does not work (it stops constantly). I have a collection of Boston warehouse udderly cows and this kitchen timer is not like any of my other stuff (which are really pretty).I haven't ask for a replacement, but I'll do."
4,5 test urine reagent strips,I bought these strips to test for microalbumin in my urine. They are not that sensitive to detect very small amounts of protein. They only detect proteinuriawhich is large amounts of protein. The other tests on the strip are accurate.
1,NOT WORTH THE BUY AT ALL!!,"I got her album ""jojo"" because of ""leave."" the album would turn out to be a disasterous flop, but the single ""leave"" turned out to be a #1 hit...and ironically, her only hit!""Baby Its You"" is a very bad song! Its so suprise it flopped and her career is over. By the way, it proves why she is unknown and only known to rich white town kiddies under the age of 13!She has no talent! Her voice is bad and she does nothing with her music. Bye bye 1-hit-wonder wannabe!"
1,JO-MO,OKAY....I ASSUME YOUR NOT A JOJO FAN AND I AGREE THAT SHE HAS FLOPPED...BUT WHY IS EVERYONE STILL REVIEWING HER STUFF. ALL OF YOU STOP! WE ALL KNOW THIS 1-HIT-WONDER IS OVER...SO LETS GET OVER IT!!
1,i like JOJO,"i am 8 yeers old and just becuse JOJO is a 1hitwonder, doesnt mean she is a nohitwonder. i gave JOJO's what people call a flop single 1 star, becuse that means JOJO gets a 100 if i think so. JOJO you are my favourit 1hitwonder."
1,The New Queen Of Flops,"...apparently this is very visible....""leave"" is her ONLY HIT and will most likely be her last....her album flopped and all singles after sunk too! She's untalented and her voice is just decent and very annoying! she sucks and thank God she is so O.V.E.R. . . just like {peer} 1-hit-wonder Lindsay Lohan and her flopped singles!"
1,JOJO'S HOROSCOPE FOR 4/23/2005:,"Since you are and obviously still are...AN UNTALENTED KIDDIE STAR WHITE GIRL WANNABEGHETTO BUT CANT BE BECAUSE YOUR AN UNTALENTED KIDDIE STAR, your career will remain the same. Expect more flopping singles and albums and no deals. your hit will always be your only hit and this flop single which the review is for is also one of your many flops! have a horrible day!"
1,wow...,"seriously...this song blows!! thank god its like her last single, because all her others ones flopped...was this even a hit...or 1 only played on the disney channel? I think smell 1 HIT WONDER, WHICH IS JOJO!!"
1,horrible artists with hardly any talent,"jojo only sings decently, co-wrote 2 songs, & fully wrote 1. Thats where her talent levels ends. She is also manufactured and stupid to like hilary duff's album, which hilary is fully untalented because she does nothing with her music, except sing (and does it horribly, just like has-beens britney spears and ciara)! Just because jojo had 2 hits doesn't mean she has talent. Hits are because if the radio likes the person, they play it and people just like the song sometimes, not whether they have talent. jojo's career is definately falling. ""Leave"" hit #1, ""Baby It's You"" hit Top 20, & ""Not That Kinda Girl"" didn't even chart and totally flopped. jojo, face the facts...YOUR UNTALENTED AND A HASBEEN, YOU 1-HIT-WONDER!!"
1,"""leave (get out)""--JOJO FOLLOWED THE LYRICS!","The horrible single which is jojo's only commercial hit ""leave (get out)"" is very ironic in jojo's life. the title is ""leave (get out)"" and jojo did just that....after her 1 hit she did what all people who knew talented wanted her to do...leave and get out of our life...and she did....she flopped...so bye bye to jojo and this flopped single!"
1,happy too,i am happi to becus the gorl below me is my frend and i want to give JOEJOE 1 star to becus i want to ce JOEJOE get a 100%. i loev JOEJOES 1 hit and hup u dow to.
1,U HAVE GOT TO BE CRAZY,TRIBES was the best game ever but if u want to sell the game over. Talk to the guys who have played it and modded it forever dont just hack it up. Ultra Renegades RULES>
4,Best Game Ever,"Good graphicts.Great weapones includeing the machine gun!Five modes Campain,hunters,deathmach,team deathmach,and team capture the flag! BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!"
5,Tribes AA. Is The Best Game,Tribes AA.has the best graphics in the entire world!!I love the futuristic guns also.The ships are all out creative and cool.Theexplotions are great and really life like.All the weapons and packs and grenades are very sweet and cool.I really hope that Sierra makes more Tribes games for PS2.
3,FUN FUN FUN BUT.....,"THIS GAME IS GREAT FUN BUT LACKS THE ONE THING THE 2ND TRIBES FOR PC GREATLY NEEDED....COMMUNICATION...BUT...CRISP GRAPHICS, GREAT DETAIL,FUN VEHICLES, GREAT KILLING MODE, I RECOMMEND DEATHMATCH MODE OR FREE FOR ALL WHERE COMMUNICATION IS NOT NEEDED, BUT BESIDES THAT, GET IT AT TARGET FOR 40 BUCKS...IT IS A WORTHWILE GAME, WITH THE ONLINE FEATURE,OVERALL RATING82.8%"
2,Don't like it.,It doesn't fit the 2012 Dodge Avenger so it is coming off of the car. I had bought a similar one for a Chrysler Sebring and it fit great. This one did not. Very disappointed.
5,A must-have guide for the compassionate consumer...,"I was given this book as a gift years ago and now I plan to buy the latest edition. This book has very concrete information, product names and contact numbers and addresses of companies that do not contribute to animal cruelty. Armed with the PETA guide, anyone can go into the supermarket or drug store and know which brands of shampoo or roll-on were manufactured without needless cruelty to animals. I recommend it to everyone who wants to take one easy step toward living a more compassionate life."
3,Couple of MAJOR things missing...,"Look,I have NO PROBLEM with a machine that is NOT running Windows. Ubuntu is a great operating system. Anyone who purchases Microsoft Office BEFORE even *trying* OpenOffice.org is not being thrifty with his or her money, to say the least.I can't give this small netbook five stars for other reasons.1)There is NO CAPS LOCK light. (I use caSe Sensitive passwords so this is a BIG pain)2)The keyboard is small (to be expected) BUT there is NO Shift key on the right side of the keyboard. Sylvania's other netbook has this.Oh well.Finally this particular Netbook seems to be slow. My guess is that since they loaded a fatter version of Ubuntu on it that's what you get.Okay so these are first generation, but wow with other competitors on the block Sylvania blew it."
2,Never worked,Loved the small form factor and was even willing to adapt to the poorly laid out keyboard but was never able to connect it via wi fi and when I could it was slow or intermittent. I called the manufacturer and they did not even know what wpa supplicant driver they where using. I also found that it was impossible to edit configuration files in an attempt to make it work. The net book remix is an easy peasy cut back version that lacks the power needed for power users. I se3nt mine back too bad so sad. It says Sylvania on the box but is made in china and supported by a group called digital gadgets not a good buy save the headache get a Dell.
4,Sylvania Meso,I have been a Windows systems engineer for a while now but I just recently purchased a Sylvania netbook with Ubuntu 8.04 installed. I have worked very little with Linux before and was very apprehensive about this OS. I must say that I have been pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and availability of applications to meet the users needs. I am glad I made the decision to buy this netbook. It does just about anything that my Windows laptop does. The only thing that I am not happy with is the fact that you can not upgrade the RAM.
1,"This computer does not work, this is a terrible purchase, beware, do not waste your time!.","This computer bombs from the beginning of start up. There are no redeeming qualities. Please do not waste your time buying it or you will be sorry, very sorry that you purchased it. Slow to start up, slow processing, slow and painful in every way."
4,Only one problem,"This is a great computer for the money, but you will have to use Ubuntu because it doesn't also come with Windows XP as it is supposed to. Ubuntu is fine and easy to use, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is a little different finding your way around."
1,Very Disappointed,"This product prompts to set the date and time every time it starts, and never saves them. If you set the time, the computer freezes and won't boot. If you ignore setting the time, the system boots but is set to January 1, 2000. If you then change the date and time, it reverts to non-set upon a reboot. It also shows a fatal error message briefly while booting. My theory is that whatever battery backs up the time in the bios is missing or not working. Hence the thing is kind of useless. It seems like quality control is a real issue on this baby.I bought this from Tiger through Amazon. I want to return it and get a refund. It seems rather junky to me."
1,Ubuntu,"I bought this netbook for the operating system but was near impossible to install Skype on it. There are many software issues and after a long period of try and error, reading many forums, and finally with the help of a computer ingeniering I installed it. The keyboard is smaller than the Asus and the overall aspect looks crapy."
3,okay but it's cute,"i like it but this said that it came with xp and it didn't, but the laptop is suuuuper cute"
5,The bomb!,This is one of the finest products out there for people who have to sing a lot. It cuts through the garbage in your throat by oiling up the vocal cords. I wouldn't do a gig without it!
3,In terms of singing...,"This product was okay. I purchased it because I was practicing for a friends wedding in which I was singing at. I tend to get nervous and my mouth and throat dry up pretty fast before/during a performance so I wanted to give this a try. The taste is not bad at all. Unless you dislike apple or cherry then you'll have no issues in that department. In terms of performance, I would say it helped but not as much as I would have preferred. The lubrication this provides only seemed to last a couple minutes or so. It's unrealistic to keep reusing between every song I sing so I had to also supplement with pineapple juice which works quite well, thanks to a tip I found online! I'm sure satisfaction varies based on how nervous you get though so for the price it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot!"
4,Tastes great! Not sure if it works yet.....,"So, the thing that I was the most worried about is it might taste horrible! But, the cherry apple tastes JUST like those green apple sour sprays, just without the sour part. I think my body has to get used to it first before I can tell if it works, b/c I just got it today, which was perfect b/c I had my Bar-Mitzvah lesson like, 5 minutes after that!But, overall, its an awesome product!"
3,Love Parker pens but,"I have been a loyal Parker fountain pen and roller ball user for over 35 years. They are great. My only regret and complaint is with their roller ball refills! They are always inconsistent -sometimes write great, sometimes on the verge of being runny and sometimes almost dried up and impossible to use forcing me to load a new one in order to write. At what the refills cost, you would think a little more quality control would go into their manufacture?"
2,Ok but replacing,"As previously stated the ink flow is too much for everyday writing in my opinion. I have ordered the fine point, they should be arriving tomorrow can't wait. Love my Parker rollerball pen. Heavy pen love the weight and the way it feels in my hand."
1,Parker Roller Ball ink refill defective,"Received this item performing very poorly, skips, ink flow isn't consistant, seems to be defective or old. Very disappointed in this item, not up to the standard I've expected for the Parker products."
5,Excellent review for approaching nonprofit jobs,"This is a concise but thorough education for aspiring job applicants on the ""how to's"" of approaching non-profits for employment. I read the book for my own interests - as trustee of a charitable foundation - and then gave it to my son, who is a college sophomore: the chapter on resume writing is, among other notable chapters, very useful for employment applications, whether as a novice or experienced professional.It's very helpful to find a resource with such an extensive, clearly-written discussion of relevant topics that can be read in a reasonable amount of time and then be applied immediately to practical situations."
1,Warped After Two Years,"Be aware that this board is constructed such that is cannot help but warp over time. Mine was treated with care, oiled regularly and dried after each washing. If you want a lasting cutting board, buy a maple end-grain board. It will outlast a dozen of these cheapos."
5,cutting board,This is a Christmas for another person; but it looks very nice. Thank you and have a Merry Christmas. Mary
5,Beautiful,What a lovely book. I am a humane educator for a humane society and find this book's message very sweet. An artist coworker loves the illustrations also. Very well done
5,An absolutely wonderful book!,"I've got a 14 month old wolfhound, and I love legends and picture books. This book was a natural for me! The pictures are beautiful. The story is quite sad, so have tissues ready. A lovely rewrite of a traditional tale."
5,a great story of a prince and his dog,"This is a great story involving the prince, his dog and his son. I think everyone has had a pet that was more friendly or faithful than their boyfriend or girlfriend. This story reminds you of the love that you had for that long ago pet. The story is well written and the illustrations are beautiful. This would make a great Christmas gift, one of those stories that work on an adult level and a children's level."
5,Dr. Rose Book is Excelent for Urban History Students,"I was Dr. Rose's history student in the undergrad and graduate levels at Florida Atlantic University (Boca Raton) Florida from 2003 to the middle of 2004. Dr. Rose beside being an excellent history professor he also is a great urban historian. His book Interstate: Express Highway Politics, 1939-1989, beside being a good book to read and enjoy, also is a great research resource for students of Urban American History. I did enjoy his book and his teaching. Professors like Dr. Rose are very few in the academic world."
3,Nice Plant,"This plant was very small when I got it. It has grown to 3 feet now with lots of foilage, but I'm still waiting for the blooms. I guess I'll just have to be patient as I have heard it takes at least 5 years."
3,"Decent film, but hardly a great documentary.","Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film. I give the writer/director credit for being a rather bold Jewish/Israeli. HOWEVER, this is hardly a truly comprehensive documentary. I have experienced anti-Semitism many times. It is real. Sometimes it is masked as religion, but it is still real and it is still anti-Semitism.This film is definitely worth viewing. If nothing else, it shows you that the ADL should take a seriously long hard look at themselves. I think they mean well, but they need to clean up their act."
4,Great pen,"I little top heavy and a little light weight in the body, so feels a bit out of balance. Bold and big. Writes nice."
3,good album,this is an album which you can just put in your cd player and sit back and listen to.not a classic album by any means bt enjoyable none the less.
4,Four Stars,This book is an excellent source regrading law and special education. I am currently still using the book for my class and I know it will be helpful when I take the state certification exam later on in the year.
3,Not Impressed,"Bought two flashlights because of the great reviews. They don't really hold a charge that long. A hefty price for an over rated product.I'm sorry I bought two flashlights,I expected more for the money."
5,Satisfied customer!!!,"I was skeptical when I ordered this book. I did not know what to expect nor did I know what condition the book was going to arrive in. WOW!!! Well needless to say I was pleasantly surprised!!! The book was in great condition, the price was outstanding and the content is excellent."
2,Good research or ...,"The Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres. Bush's policies on marriage. However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a ""private"" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative.Mr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing ""I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it."" She also states she was ""aware vaguely"" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000. Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children?I wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book?"
5,An amazing book for research!,"There's all kinds of data floating around the internet and media right now on the state of the family in America. When you're trying to pull that data together to analyze it or write about it, knowing what to trust and what not to trust can be difficult.Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher put it all at your fingertips. How does marriage affect kids? The pocketbook? Your sex life? Your health? Even your happiness is covered. And it's all backed up with study after study, so you can know authoritatively that what you've always believed is right, after all.The most interesting part of their study, to me, was the statistic that those who remain in unhappy marriages are twice as likely to be happy five years down the road as those who leave. I had suspected that, but it's great to see the proof. This book is easy to read, encouraging, and very scholarly. Highly recommended."
1,"Gee, Thanks a Lot!","Books like this one make us singles feel bad. I want badly to find that special someone, but haven't had much luck. I'm already depressed enough as it is without these two authors telling me that someone with a wedding ring is better off than me. In their view, I'll drop dead sooner because I haven't taken that walk down the aisle. Gee, if that's the case, then I guess I better start writing my will tomorrow. I guess eating right, exercising, not smoking, or driving safely won't keep me alive. Only a wedding ring will! To all you single people out there, avoid this book like the plague."
1,"Worthless, silly book","It's hard for me to imagine a more silly, less absurd book than this one. Why anyone would NEED this book is beyond me. Maggie Gallagher is a very controversial and extreme conservative, whose comments are often insulting and outrageous.Anyone seeking a nice book about marriage should look to a more rational, reasoned source than this book. There are plenty of them out there. This is not one of them."
2,Does not work with WinMe!,"There is no mention in the manual or website that this mouse only works with Win2K or WinXP. I think this should definitely be told to the customer upfront. I can use it on my daughter's computer, but it stinks that I can't use it on mine."
2,Microsoft Groovy Mouse not so Groovy,While I find most aspects of this mouse great my complaint is primarily aimed toward the scroll wheel middle click button. It is maddening to use since the wheel seems to be so sensitive. When you go to middle-click anything the wheel moves and your target link moves away. While this is very frustrating the rest of the mouse functions are great. I use Mozilla Firefox with tabs and a middle-click is very important to me. If you are looking for just a regular wireless mouse that looks great then this is it. However if a middle-click button is important to you find another choice.
3,Tired Barley,This barley was purchased for sprouting. I can only compare it with a purchase from the Sprout House. This barley is not as vital (lower sprout rate) and seemed dirtier (more loose chaff floating about). The price was better than the Sprout House so there is your trade-off.
3,Expensive blocks disappoint,"I was so excited to get these blocks for my 15 month old son, but I was a little disappointed when I took them out of the box. I expected nice, smooth foam blocks. However, because they were obviously cut from large sheets of foam, the sides of the blocks have an unfinished, not smooth texture (that probably bothers me more than my son). These are very expensive blocks and for the price I had much higher expectations."
3,Not for keyboards,"Another store suggested this as a volume pedal for a keyboard. With its sturdy build, it seemed worth the extra money. Because it has audio in and out, it can in theory be used on any electronic instrument.The result was disappointing for me. From full volume, the sound is flawless. Then barely moving the pedal downward causes the volume to cut in half, followed by a smooth decrease in volume from there. This may work for guitars, but not for keyboards.I will be returning this to the store I got it from. Based on the other review here, it is likely a guitar player will be quite happy with it."
5,Keeps my Cats Mess Contained,"I have a very fat tabby cat and I swear as an act of pure evil, he enjoys scattering litter everywhere. Not Anymore!!! This litter box keeps in his filth and I get to enjoy my bathroom much more. Don't get me wrong, hes not a bad cat, hes just gross. The litter box is very big, and DEEEEEEEP, I can fill that sucker up with litter and the Hobbes (my fat, mean cat) seems to enjoy it. The door didnt work very well but I took it off and BAM! perfect!!I hope you cat likes this as much as mine does."
4,Does its job at a great price,"This was the first covered box my big boy has ever used and he took to it right away. I did remove the door, and I agree with other reviewers that the plastic is thinner than I thought it would be, but for the price, I have no complaints."
3,Disappointed,"Received the litter box very quickly and was pleased with the size of it. I have a very large cat so I knew it would be the best choice for him. The only problem is the front right latch was broken off, so it doesn't close tightly on that side. I will keep it as it's too big to box up to return. Disappointed that a new product would come defective!"
5,Works GREAT!,"My husband wanted to buy the 300$ cat box, because he was sick of the smell, above all else. I decided to buy the Van Ness box and see if we can spare the 300$. Van Ness box is awesome. We have 2 cats and there is virtually no smell now, I love it. The swinging door was a little too low, so I cut off half an inch, and it doesn't get stuck anymore. Good product."
3,"Good product, marginal order","This is the second of these boxes I've bought from this company. They are extra large and the entrance is high, which is perfect for larger cats who have a habit of hanging their rears out the ends of lower entrance boxes. I'm giving this three stars because they shipped me a box with a blue upper portion and a beige lower portion instead of a solid one, or notifying me that they were out f stock on one particular color and giving me the option of waiting or accepting the multi-color."
3,Good product at a good price,"SUMMARYWe were looking for a litter box that was easy to clean and helped contain odors at a good price. This product works well and for the price would recommend it.PROS* Door is sized well to support larger cats (this was a big concern/consideration for us)* Easy to open and close the litter box* Comes with a cleanable filter to help control odor* Container is smooth making it usually easy to cleanCONS* Door easy falls off and as such we do not even use it* Bottom is not square and not completely flat making it sometimes difficult to clean* Where the bottom and top of the litter box meets a small gap remains. The cats sometimes urinate between it requiring more cleaning. In addition, it is possible for urine to escape between the gap."
2,design problem,"After using this box, I discovered it has a design flaw. If you have a cat that likes to urinate standing up and points towards the back of the box, the urine leaks out along the back seam. When you take the lid off urine will be on both edges of the back of the bottom and top and a small amount can also leak out onto the floor. Other than that it's a great box, but you should make sure your kitty likes to sit, not stand before you buy this!"
2,not the best,"It does it's job if your cat squats to pee. Since the lip does not raise in the back, a ""high peeing"" kitty can shoot urine into the seam. That urine can get out (trust me it happened and had to replace carpet). Also, the door breaks off, I've had a few of these boxes and every one easily snapped off."
4,cat box,it is a great deal but the pan is a bit thin i would buy it again when i need it my cat did not like the door oh well
4,X Large cat litter box,"With multiple cats, they are large enough not to be cramped. And I plan to order another box just for an extra one."
5,Much larger than other pans,"We previously had what we thought was a large cat box, until we purchased this one. We found the measurements to be exactly what was posted in the ad and received it in two business days.The depth is one key feature that we like since we have a cat that goes in the box and leaves his rear-end sticking out, thus doing his business on the floor rather than in the box. This box is too deep for him to do that, forcing him into the box all the way and keeping our floor nice and clean.Another nice feature we liked was the strength of the handle and the clasps that keep the lid onto the bottom of the box. We have to move our box around a lot, and when its full of litter, it can become quite heavy. The handle has a nice, easy grip and the clasps hold tight so the two pieces don't separate.If you have multiple cats or a large cat like we do, this is a great box to try. Our cats give it TWO PAWS UP!"
2,Not That Big,"The dimensions on this are deceiving. The bottom of the pan actually measures only 12.5"" x 16"" because the sides are tapered. Nice high sides though. Really cheap/thin plastic. If you don't need a REALLY big box then this may do the trick but calling it Extra-Large or Extra-Giant (as the label and other sites say) is misleading along with the dimensions."
3,Nice box with annoying flap door,"Regular box with cover, but an annoying flap of plastic that stayed on for about a day. Put the flap back on, and it winds up in the litter box, covered. Into the trash it goes."
2,van ness cp7,I had the new large enclosed cat litter box for about one week. I took the box outside to clean it and when i lifted it to bring it back into the house one of the locking tabs broke in half spilling out the cat litter. I sent it back and received a new one but have not used it yet.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!,Sorry Amazon. This purchase was a financial waste! It didn't solve any of my litter box issues! I think the Cat Genie may have been worth the investment instead.
5,Great Book!,Great Guide!.. I have a child with high-functioning autism. This book helps to see behavior from different perspectives. It explains how parents and teachers need to work together to help the child.
5,Marvelous,"I've purchased 3 series from this record company and I like all of them. I am especially fond of this particular arranger. His arrangements move very much like the original performances. I am a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac and an accomplished classical musician/teacher and I have made this recording a main coarse of study for all of my students. If you love Fleetwood Mac and/or Quartet Music, this is a ""Must-Buy""!"
1,Junk,"I get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers. They are junk. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink. At first, i thought it was just one bad apple. However, I currently own 3 linksys routers and dozens of wireless pc and laptop cards, and all of them are giving me problems.Stay away from these linksys routers. At best, each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again. if you're doing something important, forget it!"
1,This Sucks!,"Don't buy this if you are using a Toshiba Satellite Notebook. While configuration is easy, and the connection is there, Internet Explorer, Outlook, and other web-necessary applications WILL NOT WORK. Stay away from this piece of crap."
4,Unsecured n quick,"go against what it says. do NOT run any CD, etc. simply plug in the internet wire into the butt hole of this router. and u're online in 5 seconds.then later on u can try goin thru the manual. amazing speed, very simple, quick n efficient. i approve."
4,Wireless,The router works great; I have been using it for over a year now. The wireless card broke when one of my children dropped the laptop it was in and the end snapped off. This product came with all the documentation needed plus norton antivirus. Great buy...cheap price.
3,"Works well, but expensive","At first I had a lot of difficulty with getting this router set up. I found out that the best thing to do is instead of installing the software that comes with the router, go to Linksys' web site and download it, therefore you will be sure to get the latest copy. Since then I have not had any trouble with it."
1,Junk,"After wanting to throw this out the window - I, too, did some research. This bundled router is junk. Buy it piece meal or from another vendor but do not buy this bundle. It drops conections frequently and without moving the computer."
1,MAJOR ISSUES--Do not Buy!!,"There are significant issues with this combo, attributed to the new internal architecture and reduced power. The card is also new, and has some issues. The connection is constantly dropping off, even in close proximity. To date, Linksys is not being helpful. Rather buy the separate base and card for about $10-$20 more."
2,Stripped down version(Cheap),"I bought this router in total ignorance thinking it was cheaper that the one sold by itself just because it was bundled. Not true, this is in fact a stripped down version of the better WRT54G router, the one in the bundle has a much smaller range for the wi-fi and also some inexplicable drops in connection when used for a long time, both wired and wireless connection drop when I use a stand-alone Linksys VoIP phone, and I need to reset the router. Tech support could not help me, and there are no firmware upgrades for this. Since this is stripped down you cannot use the same firmware as the WRT version, that has tons of 3rd party firmware available.So, spend a few extra bucks and get the WRT, and a card separately, and get much better products, with better support."
5,Great value for a notebook wireless networking kit,"I am not sure why some people have complained about Linksys' WKPC54G network kit. I had all three of my notebooks running on 128-bit WEP encryption and set-up my router's security features within an hour. Signal strength throughout my 2,000 sq. ft. home is ""Excellent"" and I'm always connected at 54 MBPS. This is my first wireless router and PC card network adapter I have ever used. I didn't even use the accompanying CD to setup everything; I just used the enclosed setup poster instead. It was that easy. I've also used Linksys 10/100 Ethernet network products in my home office before and had no problems with them either. That's why I stayed with the brand."
1,Still not able to configure and use it,"I do not know whether the problem is with the router or my laptop because it does not work at all.I am so pissed off because of this that I cannot even use the wireless router. If i call customer service they say the problem is from internet service provider and when i call internet service provider they say the problem is from Router....I have no idea what to do. I think better you take the product back , else I have no idea what to do with this"
2,Could have used an editor,"This trilogy started off well and ended poorly. It seems like half the book is taken up by the main character thinking about her feelings (and letting us read about her thinking about her feelings). Not a good thing for science fiction. I think the other reviewer had it right by saying this book is the intersection between sci fi and chic lit. Maybe there's an audience for it, but hard core science fiction fans should go elsewhere."
3,OK,"I recommend RIC EDELMAN book. This one was ok but it seemed drawned out. Go to the library and read this book don't spend the money on this book. Buy companies you know, make sure they have a future, buy companies that don't have alot of debit. DUHHHHHHHHHHH...... Not horrible but not great."
3,Nothing is fool proof.,"Phil makes it sound like his system is fool proof. I had all perfect five numbers on a company. I had the perfect MOS. I had all three tools with a huge spike in volume, which said to buy. I had big money moving into the industry. I had a good CEO. I bought the company, and the stock went up five percent. Later, Jim cramer announced on his MSNBC show that the company I bought was a BUY BUY BUY!!! Before I could blink an eye, my five percent was gone.I learned a lot from his book, and his book does give you confidence to invest on your own. But, remember nothing is fool proof. His ideas do not work as well as he claims they do."
4,Great Intro Book,"It's an easy read, but very informative. This was exactly what I was looking for and will be a Phil Town fan for years to come.Phil walks you through how evaluation is done, slowly and carefully, in addition to a simple how to guide for a novice investor."
4,Good resource for novices and amateurs,"For those of us who are not professional investors, you will find some good solid advice. The most valuable aspect for me is how the author values the current and future worth of stocks. The research will take me more that 15 minutes a week, and I'm happy to take the time. I recommendThe Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition)along with this book."
3,Annual Return,"Haven't read the book, but if anyone was wondering, $1,000 to $1,000,000 in 5 years is a 146.42% annual return."
4,Rule # 1 is a great book to read,Great information on how to create and make money in the stock market during good and bad times. With the ups and downs of the current market year 2008 this book will help you pick strong stocks to hold for the future.
4,Good Information,"This book provides critical information for anyone who plans to invest in the market. To be honest, I don't understand the bad reviews. He never said it was easy. Or that great deals came along every day. Patience, and a long-term view, are essential to succeed. For readers willing to take that perspective, this book will lead you in the right direction."
4,Rule #1,"Good advice on what to look for, how to check and follow your investment and how to make decisions on buy and sell. Rather involved on finding stocks to invest and hard to find the numbers you need to review. Sounds easy but isn't when you do it. Probably a good, conservative approach if you are willing to put in the time. Directions on use of the web are outdated and should be revised for the value of the book."
4,Good not Great,"A very nice, simple and detailed book about getting rich in the stock market using a mixture of graphist and fundamentalist analysis. The only problem of this is that it makes you believe that you just read it and tomorrow you are a billionaire already. Read it carefully and calmly. Keep your mind in reality."
4,Rule #1 Review,"Overall, I liked the book. I am reading it now for the second time. Some very good investing tips and techniques, but I think it will be more difficult to regularly see the 15% gains claimed by the author, and I think the material is more complex than made out to be (that's why I'm having to read it a second time). If I try the techniques and it works, it will be the best book I have ever bought. I do recommend."
2,VERY repetitive.,"Phil seems like a nice guy and I'm glad he is sharing his investment knowledge because it appears by all accounts rock solid. But this book could have easily been cut in half in terms of number of pages to reduce the number of times he repeats himself. It seems like he mentions the calculators on his website every other page. It's almost as if the book was written so that if you picked it up in the bookstore and opened it to any random section there would be a mention of his website or the term ""Rule #1"". In addition, he dangles the carrot in front of you forever before getting to the goods. Folks this gets VERY tiring when you just want to get to at least a morsel of pertinent information. This book would get only one star from me had the strategy laid out not been so enlightening. I am not an author and I have never written a negative book review before..."
5,Best book for novice to intermediate stock investors out there. Period.,"This is a great book. It's very well written and Phil's writing style makes it an easy and pleasurable read, even if you know nothing about stocks. I've read other reviews that did not like Phil's ""salesman"" writing style. I seriously disagree. His writing style IS what makes this book so great and his concept so easy to grasp.Rule #1 is a great investment strategy. It's really all you need. It will probably however wet your appetite for more, in which case this book is an excellent starting point.The only critique I have, is that it will generally take you more than 15 minutes a week to manage your portfolio. Especially when you're doing research to find which companies and stocks are right for you. However, once you're in the market, and the weeks when you're not doing any new research, 15 minutes a week is really all you need."
3,Informational read,"It was great to read and very informational, but very difficult to put into practice. I tried very hard to follow the recommendations which are very laborious if you want to be meticulous, but very very few companies fit all the criteria recommended AND will be available at a hugely discounted stock price, which is the strategy described by the book. I still recommend reading it, and then modifying the strategy to fit your time, resources and risk level."
1,Used it in school,Our professor in business class recommended this book to be our primary textbook. The info are very old and unrealistic.
3,When does he start talking about the strategy?,"I am listening to this book via CD's from the library. It's over 11 hours in total. I'm almost through the first CD, but man... If this guy hypes this thing much more before actually explaining it, I'm going to throw it out the window. I caught myself yelling at the radio ""Get on with it!"" It's becoming painful.OK... I got it after the 20th time... 15% per year... low risk... Come on... get on with it...Does anyone know which CD to skip to to actually hear the strategy? Last one? If it's only 15 minutes per week, 11 hours listening to this hype is a joke."
3,Generally a good read,"Phil removes a lot of the arcane wizardry that I always felt about investing my own money. The one downside to this book is that to use Phil's formula to determine the ""Sticker Price"" of a stock you have to use the 'historical PE' ... for something so critical, he doesn't quite explain how he gets this number. In one part of the book he appears to use the median value of the 5-year highs and lows for the PE ratio, but in another part of the book he uses the avg PE over multiple years. These numbers give vastly different sticker prices for the stock, which makes the whole exercise a bit pointless, IMO."
3,Several Errors,"I am half-way through the book and I am extremely caught up in the fact that his numbers do not add up. For instance, taking a look at the GM data he provides on page 104, in the years 1995 and 2004, sales are $164 billion and $194 billion, respectively. He then goes on to say the sales growth rate for that period is -4%, which obviously cant' be true, since sales rose! These errors are spread throughout the book so far, in examples of Apollo Group, Garmin, and General Motors. Almost none of his Big 5 #'s work out as he tells us they should. Take a look yourself and see. Now, since I'm a beginner, I may very well be wrong, but I do know basic math, and the calculators on his web site even give the same answers that I'm getting. How can I trust this system if I'm not given any accurate data in the book itself? Otherwise, thus far, it's a good book."
3,rehash of ideas,"As the author stated in the book, the rule #1 was not invented by him. The book is a collection and rehash of ideas that are already well known.The value of the book is that it stresses the Margin of Safety and puts the investment philosophy into an organized,actionable process. It is also interesting to know the thoughts of someone (the author) who did really well in investing in the stock market.The ideas preached by the author in the books are of contradictions. The author says you should view investing as owning the underlying business rather owning the stock. Yet he tells the reader to watch the technical indicator of the stock price daily, to get in and out of the stock. It is appearant to me the author is a trader at heart, yet he is a trader that uses fundamentals as a guide. He is a savvy trader who is very aware of margin of safety."
4,A great book to learn the market.,A great book to learn more about how to invest and wrote in simple terms.
1,Horrible Advice,"One of the most simplistic and untrue book on investing I have ever read, and I've read plenty.He tells you that getting a 15% annual return is very easy to do if you just follow his advice, LMAO.Oh yeah, tell that to all of us who have lost 30-40% of our money in the stock market these last years.If you want to lose money in the stock market, buy this book."
4,Great Book,I am only rating with 4 stars right now because I have not finished the book. But it has been very good so far. Have a friend who is already putting to use some of the info presented.
1,Dumb Gimmick,"A new month, a ""new"" approach to investing. Come on guys, it's time to realise that another fad book is not the way to earn money. This latest installment in the genre is just more of the same old bull."
2,Worth your time and money,"This is by far the best book I've read on how to buy stocks at the right price, without a doubt! I really enjoyed this well written and informative book, it's a must read for the serious individual investor."
1,What's the #1 Rule?,"I have not read it yet, but my partner is trying to muddle through it. He said that so far he has not received clear direction or advice that would help him understand stock investments and where to start. Also, he still doesn't know what the #1 rule is."
4,Must-read for long-term investors,"There must be 100,000 or more books written on investing or trading. Phil Town's RULE #1 is one of the better ones I've come across. The greatest value to me was learning how to identify when a stock is truly a good value. After reading the book, I also purchased the audio portion, which does a good job of encapsulating the key points of the book. I would rank RULE #1 in the top five investing/trading books I have read."
5,Great Investment Advice and an Easy Read,"This is by far one of the best books on personal finance I have read. It's written in a way that everyone can understand. At one point in the book, Phil makes a suggestion that people give this investment advice to their children at 15 years old and let them start to use the Rule #1 investment strategy; I completely agree. I think the principles are easy to understand and provide sound advice. This book teaches two fundamentals that are commonly lost on people when investing in the stock market: (1) Know the value of what you're buying, (2) If you become ""financially literate"", you will no longer need people to invest for you.I loved the book and I'm telling everyone about it!"
4,Rule 1 Investing,"Very good information but not easy to put it all together for actual use. The calculator on the Internet site makes it easier. However, many calculations are not able to come up with all the key ratios because of data error input that is outside of the users control.In the final analysis the information is useful but not simple since it takes considerable effort and time to research each selection before one is able to arrive at a decision point to consider buying or rejecting the company.An Excel template with formulas would be helpful in addition to the ""calculator"" on the ruleoneinvester.com site."
5,Great Book...Dump your investor and do it yourself.,"I'm a past investor in the stock market who was converted over to mutual fund investing after too much time invested in watching stocks. After reading this book, I am converting back into the stock market in the near future.While in the process of converting my funds, I'm writing a program to follow the rules in Rule #1 to create a spreadsheet of all stocks in certain exchanges. This will simplify the process and identify companies with the qualities needed and require even less time.I've read other material on investing in the past and looking back now none of the methods or ideas really make much sense. Following the methods of Rule #1 has motivated me back in the markets to take over my retirement plans and plan for an earlier retirement.I'd recommend this book for any investor who has invested in the past without much success or those looking to invest for the first time. Follow the rules."
3,Well written and easy read but...,"After reading this one I concluded it was well written, readable, and thorough. The content is a little rich for real beginners but too basic for even moderately experienced investors. It serves as a good refresher because it is easy to read. And it does brig us up to speed with changes in the world of investing and trends to watch. So, I don't regret reading it, but it hasn't changed my life. I would borrow it before buying it, not a keeper."
1,I was fooled.,"Easy to read and written in the tone of my best friend who is just a little bit smarter than me. I read this book... carefully. I never got to the 15 minutes per week stage. I never even got to the buying stage. After investing hours of time navigating MSN Money and Yahoo! Finance, just like the author said, I never got close to getting all the numbers needed to make a decision on which companies to buy.Yet, it all sounded so wonderful as I was reading the book. But when I sat down at the computer and tried to put it all into practice I succumbed to frustration. After many hours of viewing numbers and comparing them, mind you.I don't recommend this book."
4,Rule #1 Hardcover,"I was a little disapointed when this showed up without the dust cover. I don't recall seeing it being listed as such. The book itself is exactly what I expected with the exception of the dust cover. Thank you, James"
1,"this is an acetone polish remover, not non-acetone",I was so disappointed when I got this. When I looked at the back of the bottle at the list of ingredients the first ingredient was acetone. I'll be asking for my money back.
2,"Great idea, but didn't work for us...","We love the system we bought for our first, but when we tried to use the add on camera for our second baby, it didn't work. Not sure why. Just loads of static/interference. Could be our house, the close proximity of the bedrooms, local wireless, etc. Who knows. Wish it would've worked b/c I love my Ultra Wireless System with just one camera."
2,"More contract, less statute","The arguments used in this book are typical of the political correctness much in vogue in Canada when multiculturalism was triumphant. Times are gradually changing now. People are starting to realize that segregation in order to preserve indian identity is in the long run a dead end for the well-being of Americans of indian descent. Latin American immigrants, of similar genetic characters, are integrating much more successfully in the modern society. Indian natives should receive for what they do, not for what they are, otherwise they will develop a victimist mentality which will make them bitter and dependant."
4,Computers in the Medical office,Needed the book for a class. Find it fairly user friendly and easy to follow. Document Source at the back of the book very useful.
2,Missing stuff.,The book was missing all the excersice part after each chapter. I wasn't expecting this. The vendor should it inform this before I bought it.
5,computere in the medical office,i was very happy with the product brand new just the way it said in the review ship right away too
2,Did not come with the CD,This book did not come with the CD that I am needing for school. Amazon should state that it doesn't! If I can't find the CD I will be returning this book.
4,"good book, excellent condition","Is a good book, but I found out we are not using it for the class. another one will be use instead. Overall it was in excellent condition. I will definitely buy again from this seller."
4,"Insightful, but at times hard to read","I am a devoted Victorianist and found the info in this book to be a useful study of certain aspects of London. However it suffers a little from too much effort to be ""academic"" so that the writing style gets stiff and wordy at times. Nevertheless, the discussion of the pleasure gardens of early Victorian London and for me the discussion how how women looked at public versus private identities were very good. Worth a read if you want some more depth in your studies of London or Victorian perspectives."
2,the gospel of judas,"The characters are not developed to the full, rather they are indulged upon: their most interesting side would be their atonement but again this aspect is superficial and self-assolutory. The prose has a repetitive mannerism that is preposterous enough that you can recognize right away which sentences are going to be found after a page.This was my first reading of Mr. Mawer, I hope ""The Glass Room"" will be better."
5,DANE-ELEC 1 GB SD Card (DA-SD1024-R),"I am very happy with this product, and with its price. It has been working well for me in an (older) portable auto navigation system. I intend to buy more of these cards for use in other devices."
5,"Alice In Chains, Rooster Shirt","Classic Alice In Chains T Shirt, the song Rooster is a favorite for all Alice in chains fans, very pleased when it arrived :-)"
1,Annoying gaps in mesh,"Every time you open or close your silverware drawer, the tips of forks and knives will slide up and get caught in the chrome mesh, the gaps of which are too large. Extremely poor design for such a simple product."
1,don't buy,i bought this years ago and i absolutely hate it. the other review listed is correct in saying that the flatware gets caught in the mesh and i've had the experience where the flatware not only got caught in the mesh but also got caught on the top part of the cabinet and i couldn't open the draw. not a good product at all.
2,Terrible Design,Not only do forks and knives get caught in the mesh from the natural motion of the drawer opening and closing.. but is will RUST. The metal is not stainless and it's not coated with rubber or plastic. That means that any incidental water that is still on washed flatware will cause the bottom of the tray to rust... Stay away from this thing. I gave it two stars instead of one because the tray itself is fairly sturdy and does in fact hold flatware as advertised.
2,Disappointing---old stories repackaged into a new dvd,"We thought this was going to be a new Madeline story...unfortunately it is the old ""Madeline in New York"" and ""Madeline in Hollywood"" repackaged in a new dvd with a new cover. Both episodes have already been available on dvd for many years. The ""bonus"" feature is ""Madeline and the wild west"" which may or may not be new, I'm not sure. Too bad they cannot come up with some new episodes, instead of just a new cover to the dvd."
2,Meh,"The ""suspense"" part of the story was lacking--I guessed who the villain was within the first twenty pages. Dialog doesn't flow smoothly and there was an awkward feel to the whole story. It's too bad this one was a dud."
2,No what I was expecting!,I ordered a replacement for the above model # and received the bulbs as ordered. The bulbs were not bright like the others we had in our arena. I will pay the high price next time. Dissatisfied with the brightness of bulb. You get what you pay for. I paid half price for the bulbs.
5,For people who like pictures....,"A very insperational book! It doesn't have much to read, but the illustrations tell a thousand tales (sorry if that was cheezy.) As a student animator myself who would like to someday work at Pixar, it's nice to get a behind the scenes glimpse at the creative process behind their works. I would like to thank Pixar for making this book and also my girlfriend for getting it for me."
2,For trivia lovers only,"I bought this book to learn how NHL hockey is played. I read the Complete Idiot's Guide Football and found it to be a very well organized, comprehensive description of the game. This book about hockey is nothing at all like that. If you don't know how hockey is played, you won't be any smarter after reading this. There are 298 pages of history and only 18 or 19 pages on the rules. You will learn what icing and offside penalties are and which way players are not allowed to hit each other with the stick and that's about it. Nothing at all about strategy and tactics and no glossary of terms. I was disappointed. If you want to learn the basics of hockey, look elsewhere."
2,"Buy for history, not for how-to","I was disppointed in this book, especially since it was touted to have ""comprehensive"" rules. It has only one chapter on rules, and even then it barely brushes the surface.If you want to know about the background of how modern hockey came to be, it's great. But I wanted to know more about strategy, rules, penalties, officials' hand signals, etc. and there is very little in it. Had I known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it. Very disappointing."
3,Too Many Boyfriends,"I guess I liked the book, but I don't like how Stacey is totally obsessed with boys. I mean, 5 ex-boyfriends at the age of 13?? Thats not normal for a person that age! I also think Stacey is a little to obsessed with shopping. The author should get Stacey a better head on her shoulders and not keep having a different boyfriend in every different book!"
5,A Fast Paced Thriller- Couldn't Put It Down,"Crisis, by new author Erik Qualman, is an excellent modern political thriller. Qualman is adept at developing his characters and intricately meshes several parallel story lines throughout the novel. The result is a superior tale that tackles issues of modern politics, social consciousness, romance, revenge and youthful reflection on lost opportunity. Looking forward to the author's next endeavor!"
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,THIS RACK WILL ONLY FIT BIKES WITH DISK BRAKES AND PRE WELDED TABS ON THE FRAME FOR THE RACK TO BOLT TO.
2,May require extensive fitting,"The rack is well made, and looks and feels that it can support quite a bit of weight. The problem is the standoffs for the lower mounting bolts. The standoffs are essentially cubes, so make sure that you have plenty of room surrounding the lower mounting holes. My mounting holes were rather close to a cross brace, so I spent several hours filing the standoffs down to make it fit. Expect blisters.Aside from that, I've got no real complaints about this product. The top mounting tube is 10.2mm wide which is quite a bit thicker than most bicycle baskets. You'll probably have to improvise here as well unless you're using Topeak's MTX baskets. I'm rather partial toTopeak's Trolley Tote Folding Basket.If you can make it past these two quirks (and remember that it's really not a problem with the rack per se, but the rack and bicycle combination that I'm using), this is a fine product for the price."
2,Different shades,"At the reduced price, they are okay, but are not uniform in color. If I'd seen them in a store, I would not have purchased them."
1,Disappointing,This book was terrible. It was a total ripoff. I expected a detailed account of her life and all I got was a summary. It was over before it began. I want my money back because this was total BS.
3,"Irish - yes, Luka - no.","Caution! If you are thinking about buying this cd because you are a Luka Bloom fan, as I am, forget it. Sixteen cuts and he performs only one song. This album is a collection of Irish music with many and varied performers. If you enjoy celtic music then give it a go. Otherwise, choose again."
1,Not so great,"I bought this to go with a belle dress for my daughter to wear to disney. When I received it, it was definately not what I expected. It was flimsy and huge. Not something a 4 year old would want to wear on her head all day. It's also pricey for what you get. I would not reccomend this product to anyone."
4,Easy to go in...and out...,"I ordered these when we moved into our new home because they were more attractive than traditional cables and seemed easy to use. They work fine, but I gave them 4-stars because they come out too easily. Therefore, they definitely aren't child-proof, and I wouldn't recommend placing them in children's reach."
3,good product,good and worksI thought the product came in the original box but it came in a paper envelope
2,pick and choose,a lot of history was left out and it seemed that only what the author felt was important was focussed on.
2,Disappointed,"I'm really disappointed in the quality of this DVD -- NOT in Meryl Streep. First, because there's no way to choose which of the movies you watch. The first one's first and that's it. Second, there's no closed captioning. My mother needs it, so I can't watch it with her. And she's always near the TV. Makes me wonder if it's pirated."
3,no more drama,"some one should end this drama,sounds like mystikal meets gomer pyle then graduates to general makaveli."
2,left right left forward march,"this ain't nothing like no-limit. this cat is from the A-T-L-A-N-T-A, G-A like he say. this boy be going off. how dare you say this is like master p and them, when did you see a no-limit video get that much airplay."
4,4 BANGERS & 1 AVERAGE SONG,"LEFT, RIGHT, LEFTDOUBLE TIME (DRAMA CADENCE)ITS DRASTICTHE PLOT=bangersMY NAME IS DRAMA=averageonly 9 songs but 5 are good & worth listening to & most albums that have 12 - 15 songs only have 4 or 5 song that are good & worth listening to so its worth the money & I bought it when it dropped & I still have it I thinkdoes anybody know whatever happened to DRAMA ?? he did a short bid right when this cd dropped but got out & then what ?? does he have any other albums ?? & did he really get his deal by rapping for SHAWTY REDD @ a BBQ & beat on his chest as a beat ??"
3,Only liked a couple of songs,"I really never listened to the entire album, I just downloaded two stand out tracks that are good ""Double Time"", and Left,right left. those are good"
3,Daniels review,I think Just from listening to the samples that this artist could go a long way. His samples sound pretty good. Iwould recommend this album to friend.
3,A combo of the Dirty South,"I found the CD to be similar to all of the great rappers of the dirty south, if not the best; Drama reminds me of The Goodie Mob's sound with a heavy southern draul, 2-PACs militant style, devilish LOOKS, and his creative way of phrasing words!I would never compare Drama to any No Limit artist, he's sound is more southern and unforgettable. His raspy voice and extremely militant rap style is more authentic, more than the No Limit solders, who do not seem militant at all these days. I loved the left-right-left, and Double Time (Drama's Cadence) tracks. The rest of the CD is just too southern for me, like the mama song. I really hated that song; I just cannot vibe to it at all. But I like the other tracks on the CD; they are O.K."
4,"Beats Are Raw, Lyrics are aight, Overall is good","This has some of the cleanist sounding bass that i've heard out of my system. The tempo is perfect for his style of rap ( although he does scream too much at times ) and his lyrics will improve over time. The downside to this cd is that if you take away the intro song ( 50 sec. ) and the radio cut of left,right,left, and the small skit before that, you have like 8 or 9 tracks only. All of these 8-9 tracks are good though, which is about how many you find that are good in a CD loaded with 20 18 songs. Spend 12 bucks, get the cd."
5,Ga brings it again,"I may be a midwest cincinnati boy, but I know a tyte cd when I hear it, Drama is one of many ga rappers bringin it, and bringin it hard. GET THIS THIS CD. your loss if you don't"
3,Sounds like No Limit...,"This CD is alright. It sounds a lot like an average No Limit CD, I dont know if thats a good thing or not. This Drama guy sounds a lot like some No Limit rappers, especially Fiend. Double Time is a pretty good track, while Its Drastic is my favorite track. It's pretty tight."
4,No Limit-nah he's got his own style,"Alright lets get this straight for all you people who say he sounds like no limit. No Limit doesnt have a cd that could stand up to Drama's first drop. Sure Fiends first cd, or mystikal's second cd but nobody else. No Limit's beats all sound the same, and are too dry to sound like Drama. On Drama's CD: if you want bump in your trunk this is it. Drama spits out some tight lyrics, along with hard beats. left right left is just a taste of his ability, Drastic is the bomb. Its true his ""Mama"" song is dull, but its not his style; and thats the only slack song on the cd. If you like Pastor Troy, and what he brought to the game then you'll love Drama no doubt, and another creepin lyricist is Miracle, his single ""Bounce"" is hard! Drama is setting the tone for 2000!"
2,Cheap solution but falls short,"The Van Ness enclosed cat pan is a cheap solution to your litter problems, but falls short in the end. The front door of our litter box broke after about two months of use. Also, the unit fails to retain nasty smells. Have a large cat? Then this litter box is certainly not for you."
2,Too small,This product arrived broken. It was smaller than I imagined.I have a small kitten and she barely fits in it!
4,nice,"Great price/product ratio, though the door is a little bit high... will be great for big cats, but kitten wont be able to jump into it. the vent is a great and welcomed addition"
3,My cat didn't understand this product.,"My kitty, who has used both covered and uncovered boxes in her 13 years, simply didn't ""get"" this product. It's only been 24 hours but I came home from work tonight and she'd peed and pooped on my bed (she lives in my bedroom--don't ask, it's her decision). I will try again tomorrow with the flap removed, but I wanted it so it could keep the odor at bay."
1,Design of this is terrible,"Why can't catbox designers make it so that the top fits INTO the bottom so that nothing drips out?! I have a big male that aims to pee as high up the side of this box as he can get and all that extra urine collects under the rim where the top snaps onto the bottom, and then it just drips onto the floor. Drives me CRAZY! I have tried everything! The only thing that comes remotely close to working is using extra large liners, pulling all the excess over the sides, snapping on the top, and then folding the liner up over the edge of the top. At least then the urine is contained instead of ruining my carpet. Whoever designs these things has never owned a large cat."
3,Pretty nice,"Works good and is easy to clean. My only complaint is that the door fell off in the first few days. I put it back on and it fell off again in another few days. Now it just stays off. I have it in my laundry room in my basement, so I can't speak to whether the smell is not contained as well without the door or not after a fresh stool is deposited."
2,"THE ""LARGE"" IS VERY SMALL","Very disappointed with this product. The""large"" is tiny and I have a small cat. It is also very lightweight and flimsy. The little plastic door came right off as I was setting it into place for the first time and will not stay on. Headed back to Amazon."
4,Litter Box,This is a very well-made product. It was just what I was looking for and the Amazon price compared very favorably with prices of similar litter boxes in local stores.
5,No more scooping litter out of the box!,"I got this for my 4 month old male kitten because the litter box we had before was a really shallow one with no lid, and he thought it was hilarious to stand in front of it and scoop out litter with his paws onto the floor. He did this randomly even when he wasn't even using it. So far this litter box is great and it's too tall for him to scoop anything out with his paws. It seems sturdy and well built and it's a good size. Only con is that I cannot figure out the door flap. When the door flap is inside, the cat can't get out (this happened with my kitten, he was trapped in there), and when you put the flap on the outside, there is no way to get inside unless you lift the flap. The flap doesn't really make any sense and it seems like a design flaw so we just removed it. My cat doesn't urinate on the side of the box so I can't comment on any leaking problems like other people have said."
3,Good product - cat did not like-too closed in,Our cat would not use this litter box as it had one way in/out and she seemed to find it claustrophobic or threatening. Perhaps she thought she was going to vet!
3,I made a mistake - re only rec'd half my order!,"I posted this earlier about not receiving the bottom of the litter pan.MY MISTAKE!It was nested in the top and i thought it was one piece. I apologize for my error. i am very happy & satisfied with my purchase, quality of product is high, and i received it in 4 days."
1,Van Ness CP6 enclosed cat pan/litter box,"After just one use the windo/door got stuck when the cat exited the litter box, preventing him from entering again. After shoving the window/door back to the inside, it again locked him out the next time he exited the box I cannot say anything positive about a product that I can't use."
1,Not good,This item appears to have been kicked around the warehouse for an hour prior to shipping. The top is covered in a variety of of scratches. Some deep and some light but all are permanent. Its even cracked in a corner on the top. I do not recommend this item.
1,Does not appear to be a sifting litter box,"The description would lead you to believe this is a sifting litter box, but I went to look at it at a walmart and it is not. There only 2 pieces in the packaging: the bottom and the top. Am I missing something?"
4,Insight,"Charlotte Haptie brings you into a world of magic. This book tells of a heartwarming tale of an alternate universe, when humans and magicos lived together. This book will open your eyes to the wonders of magic, the strong bonds of friendship and the meaning of being a family"
5,Track listing,1. Selph2. Blacked Out3. Piece of Mine4. Master5. Second Chance6. Societies Hate7. Stupid B!tch8. Hear Me Now9. Fairy Tales10. Fear the Pressure11. Head Games.
3,"Aftermarket, Aftermarket","Waited to receive product, very well packed and as advertised. The only issue the unit did not pivot towards the right. Regardless I kept it, I needed it. To be fair I did not notify the vendor."
4,Prepare for a younger sibling,"Jim is a young boy who suddenly finds himself with a younger sister. His older sister is helping to take care of her but Jim is not pleased.No one asked Jim if he wanted a new sister. Jim is lonely as everyone is too busy with the new baby. But when night falls, Jim has a chance to tell the crying baby what is what. But in the moonlight, little Jane smiles at Jim and the two become fast friends.This is one of a number of ""new baby"" books our daughter read before she had a little brother. She still enjoys it even a year after his birth.A fun story with fun lines and rhymes that deals with a real issue older children have to deal with when a new brother or sister arrives."
1,Would be great if customer service was behind you,"I purchased the item because I work for a company that deals with a lot of other companies and getting business cards is a large part of the communication. I thought it would streamline the process. It would but the unit keeps crashing. I would enter 20 or 30 business cards, write all the contact information in and then the next time I go to access it, it won't let me in. I get an error message. I've tried to get in touch with IRIS and get it resolved but they don't respond. Very dissapointed."
2,Not much of a time saver. Works 50%,I am dissapointed that I cannot return this to Amazon for a full refund after trying it. The OCR is not as good as expected. It is completely usless for about a third of the cards I've tried. Fewer than 10% work perfectly. I feel I have to thoroughly scrutinize every entry because of numerous minor mistakes. My girlfriend told me not to buy it and I should have listened.
2,Not for American ACT! Users. Five stars for non ACT! users,"the bad news:I purchased and returned the card reader because of a few ""glitches"" when converting to ACT! First, it does not convert telephone numbers in USA format XXX-XXX-XXXX. You must add 01 or else the conversion is made in the Notes section and requires a copy and paste into the telephone field of ACT! Second, you cannot add any fields, such as ID/Status, which results in ""lost"" contacts when you import into a large database.The good news: Easy installation, superior recognition and no-nonsense to use. Definitely recommended for non ACT! users"
5,Awesome Product,This is a superb product. Electronic rolodex with the options to export to Outlook and many other programs. Automatically fills in the information from the card to the program. Great feature!
1,Not compatible with WIndows XP,"I was very dissappointed when I got this product and tried to install on my computer with XP and got the microsoft warning that it did not have the ""digital signature"" and not therefore certified compatible with Windows XP and could cause damage. The response from Iris was they didn't pay Windows for the validation: but similar products (Cardscan, NewSoft Presto, and BizCardReader) whose demosoftware can be downloaded do not have this problem, each having the appropriate ""signature""."
4,Very Nice,"Very cute addition to my kids' Plan dollhouse. So cute and tiny, really improves the play value of the dollhouse. My favorite part of these is that all Plan dollhouse and accessories come in 100% recycleable packaging, well done!"
5,Great addition to our dollhouse.,Great miniatures that are well made and brightly colored. Lots of fun for the children to play with. Would recommend.
3,Too many alternative viewpoints or a great story?,"I thought this book was beautiful, both in the dreamlike quality of the writing and rich pictures that vividly depicts the scene captured in snapshots frame don eery other page. However, granting this boy a vision and warning dream seems like stretching the alternative view that doens't glorify Chirstopher Columbus and instead focuses on how his arrival killed off the people with diseases andenslaved them. Perhaps I have been too saturated with this type of view so that the alternatives are just as annoying as the tradition ""Columbus was wonderful"" stories. Perhaps just telling a more middle line truth would be more helpful. Otherwise, the book is blessed with Yolen's storytelling talent, a touching story, and beautiful illustrations."
5,This CD is the best thing!,"There isn't one song on this album that I don't like. And how many times does that happen? Not many...if you only listen to one track on this CD, make sure it's ""Time Stood Still"" by Madonna. I believe it's one of her best songs since ""Take a Bow""."
5,Amazing Soundtrack!,"This CD is a must buy for all Madonna fans because all the songs are in Madonna's taste. All the songs have a nice, ambient, rhythmic beat. An honorable mention goes to Metisse because the song, ""Boom Boom Ba"" is beautiful. The two tracks by Madonna, ""American Pie"" and ""Time Stood Still"" are great as well. Other tracks include Christina Aguilera, Moby, and Olive. I definite recommend you buy this amazing soundtrack."
4,"Orbit exposed, but buy it anyway!","If you've been drawn to this album by the incredible production of William Orbit on Beautiful Stranger.... Then two surprises lie in store. Firstly you'll be surprised by the production on American Pie, what were you thinking William?. You can just about make out that he was probably (somewhere)in the studio while it was being recorded. Time Stood Still works far better, one gets the feeling he ""got his way"" a bit more on this track. Secondly, and the biggest surprise of all is that there are a couple of tracks on here that make Mr Orbit sound as if he has been sitting on his laurels for the past couple of years. Newcomers Moby and Metisse bring to this album a freshness and innovation that make it worth buying for these tracks alone. While the rest of the album does the business, there is a certain element of ""take it or leave it"", but don't leave it ... discover Metisse and Moby now. And thank Madonna for the introduction!"
1,A Travesty,"Let me say this first: I like Madonna. However, in her latest effort, she has managed to suck the very life out of a song regarded as an American classic. Her anemic rendition of 'American Pie' is a travesty, and any person in the recording industry associated with the production or release of this abomination should be ashamed."
1,more like -10 stars! Bleeeeeccccchhhh! who would buy this?,"okay, okay so there is madonna, a great singer, but why not wait for her new CD to come out. And my favorite, Hottie Christina Aguilera with a GREAT voice, but the rest of the CD makes you wanna puke. I know I did. People you've never heard of singing something that sounds like a cat in a blender. They say Madonna picked all the people for the CD on her own, but she can't be that stupid, can she?"
1,The Next Best Thing,Extremely disappointed in this selection. The songs are boring and dumb. I think the only song worth anything is American Pie which is lacking in creativity. Skip this CD if you have any appreciation for music and style.
1,Next Worst Thing,"I must say I am very disappointed with this cd. I am a huge Madonna fan and purchase all of her cds and this one is the worst since the soundtrack to ""Who's That Girl"". The new ballad from Madonna , Time Stood Still, is great. However, the version of American Pie on the cd is the slow boring version from the video. Avoid this horrible CD and save up for the remixes on the import cd."
2,william orbit you killed madonna,"this CD is good, but some songs are really bad ,agulera's song is super trash,I hope if william orbit die because we want our 80's madonna back."
1,It doesn't even deserve 1 star,"I will admit, i have never been that big of a Madonna fan.. This cd proves that my opinion is right!.. Like others have said.. her version of American Pie is so tacky!.. The rest of the cd is just as bad.. I happen to like Christina Aguilera, i think she has a great voice. But the song is not original at all.. It's sad to see that a great voice has to record junk like that.. If you like her just listen to her current cd.. don't waste all that money for this one song.. I am just glad i heard the cd from the net, b4 i would of bought it."
1,The Next Best Thing To Death,"This soundtrack is very bad. First, there is the bland, bleeping remake of the classic ""American Pie"" in which Madonna lacks little if any enthusiasm. Then, her bland ballad ""Time Stood Still"" which sounds like all of her previous ballads and offers nothing new. The other songs are throw-a-way offerings from other albums by other artists. This is one that definitely should be left in the store! A complete failure on all levels."
1,Destroyed,"What possessed Madonna to attempt to remake ""American Pie""? She completely ruined the song, which is a timless piece of art. She completely DESTROYED it! It makes me sick when I hear it on the pop stations, and I salute the local rock stations for vowing to never, ever play this garbage!"
1,The Worst Thing,"This album features a whole bunch of filler and two new Madonna tracks. Her version of ""American Pie"" is lame and embarrassing. Her ballad ""Time Stood Still"" is a bland, average ballad along the lines of her previous ballad ""One More Chance."" This soundtrack needed more guidance, as it is very boring. I cannot recommend it. Keep your money."
4,haven't seen the movie,"but this is a solid collection of slick, tuneful modern pop. The songs are quite distinct from one another, and cover a wide emotional range, but they all seem to inhabit the same ambiance. Right now, this CD is my top pick for dinner party background music.The first time I heard it, I found Madonna's cover of ""American Pie"" hollow and forced, but repeated listening revealed a shimmering quality that's quite enjoyable in its own right. The lyrics don't mean anything anymore, but Madonna has resurrected the song's pop essence.Olive's version of ""I'm Not in Love,"" closer in sensibility to the original, is another very worthwhile cover.I need to give the album a few more spins, but at this point, Beth Orton's plangent ""Stars All Seem to Weep"" is sounding like the strongest track in the bunch."
4,not bad at all,"i usually hate soundtracks because, inevitably, only one or two songs are worth listening too, but this one surprised me. although i must say that this christina chick is really annoying! can we say overkill on these teeny-bopper singers! why is she on this?"
4,GREAT ATMOSPHERE!,"This is a great cd to hold you until the new Madonna cd. Two great tracks by the ethereal gal. ""American Pie"", either you love it or hate it. Love it! A great sampling of other tripy, electronica artist. It loses a star for the inclusion of the horrid Christina Aguilera and equally horrid song by the afore mentioned horrid one."
1,Laughably bad!,"The only song on here worthy of the name is, of course, American Pie. But, what a dreadful version this is. To cut the length appropriate to ""dance"" music - that is, what kids would be stupid enough to pay for - the song is butchered so that what remains of the lyric makes no sense at all. Then the melody is sacrificed to the merciless pounding that passes for rhythm on very low-budget ""music"". However, the saddest thing of all is the performance of Madonna. It is literally laughable. Never the greatest singer on the planet, by some margin, this song betrays a woman aging before her time - often out of breath and unable to sustain even the most accessible notes. If you can dance to this inept pap from Granny - good luck to you - but, pay for it - Never!"
2,You've got to be kidding me...they're huge!,"I had read the other reviews before buying these vitamins. We have been using the Weil Daily Vitamin Packs which are much more expensive and this bottle is cheaper and I couldn't imagine the pills were that big but they are! Unless you are a pill swallowing champion, I recommend the Daily Packs. They are excellent quality and are easier to swallow."
4,I like this multivitamin,"I enjoy this vitamin. I have to cut it in half but I do that with all daily vitamins. I definitely have more energy. Splitting the vitamin is not a complaint, per se, but rather more of a personal preference."
4,trusted product,Dr Weil's products are well researched. These vitamins are a great balance. The only reson I did not give it five stars is price.
3,I Don't See A Difference,"Some people have commented on how large these tablets are, but Iam used to taking large multi vitamins, so these did not bother me.I've been taking these multi vitamins for over a week now, and I really don't see any difference in how I feel after taking these multi vitamins versus other multi vitamins, which I have been taking a multi vitamin for years now. I was hoping with it being a product from Andrew Weil that they would somehow work better for me.Price wise I guess it's ok. Maybe a few dollars more than I was paying for over a years worth of vitamins, at 360 tablets between the two bottles that is almost a years worth of vitamins with this brand. I will finish them up, but I doubt I will be buying more of this multi vitamin, unless I really notice an improvement in how I feel."
5,Cut in half...,"I've been using these vitamins for over a year now. They are a bit big, so I cut it in half and take one half with breakfast and the other half with dinner. I like these vitamins."
3,Too hard to swallow,"I tried to like these pills because the ingredients seem quite generous compared with other multivitamins. However, I finally gave up because they are so hard to swallow and because they give me a stomachache. The pill covering tastes horrible too and erodes quite easily, making it even more difficult to swallow. When I started to ""forget"" to take them I knew it was time to switch."
4,Best we have found...,"After many years of looking for a good, practical multiple vitamin, we have hit on one with Dr. Weil's brand and have been taking for three years. Nothing harsh like others that go thru the body within hours; these are lasting and both of us have noticed a difference in how we feel, the energy level we have, etc. We have started the practice of cutting in two and taking one half in the morning, the other with dinner and found this to work the best for us. Reasonably priced and we feel like we know what we are putting into our bodies with Dr. Weil's products."
3,shipping charges,"Weil Nutritional Daily Multivitamin for Optimum Health, Tablets, 180-Count BottleI ordered 2 bottles of the vitamins to be shipped together, but was charged 2 shipping charges making the online purchase much less attractive."
3,The seal was warped,I bought this item at Amazon -- the pills seem ok but the seal is warped -- They probably stored it in a moist place -- not a good idea
2,Makes me sick,"This pill is large enough to choke a pony, difficult to swallow, and hard to digest. I am sure the vitamin blend is balanced properly, but if I have had anything less than a three-course meal, I end up feeling nauseated within minutes of taking it. It does say on the bottle that it's best to take with food, but it doesn't say how much food. If I try to take it with a piece of toast and a cup of coffee, that's not enough of a cushion to keep me from puking it all up. Dr. Weil's books are fantastic, and I enjoy some of his other products, but I actually dread taking this vitamin. I will try to finish the bottle but next time I will buy a different multivitamin."
2,Large pills; made me sick to my stomach,"I had read the previous reviews before purchasing the vitamins so I was prepared for the large size of the pills. They also have the awful natural vitamin smell. Because they contained such a great combination for a multi vitamin, I was going to overlook those two deficiences.However, these vitamins made me throw up or get extremely nauseous three different times so I have now given up on the pills."
3,A usefull book,"I bougth this in 1990 and I still use it. It shows step by step the way to get there. the lack is that it not tell you pit falls,neither teach you the tips everybody needs, plus it has no color illustrations."
3,It was what it was!,"A no budget horror film with some effects and decent acting. Boring at times but all in all it was what it was, entertainment for the night."
5,Storms of the Dead,"i love this movie,i thought it was very entertaining and fill with lots of action!"
3,Missing viola strings.,"Item arrived quickly, and child brought it to school. Music teacher said the strings on the viola were not viola strings. The viola strings were missing. And, it would not play correctly, so had to return to Amazon."
1,Not worth the money,"I just received this Cecilio CVA-400 viola in the mail. I am not a viola expert. We had been renting a viola from the local music store but wanted to buy a viola for my 8 yr old son for christmas. It is very cheaply made. The tuning pegs are cheaply made - they slide backward when trying to tighten the strings so it is impossible to tune the viola. On the positive side, it comes with a nice case (although it relys on a rubber band to hold the bow in the case, and some accessories."
4,Bully for Bull of Blue River,"The Wild Bull of Blue River is a delightful telling of Indiana in the 1890s during the gas boom. The story focuses on Lamb, a young girl whose love costs her a family, and the Wild Bull, her protector. Interwoven with poetic language and excellent descriptions, The Wild Bull of Blue River gives the reader characters to care about and a romantic and historic storyline. Great for adults and students!"
3,David's Birthday,A INTRIGUING INSIGHT INTO FAMILY LIFE IN ITALY AS WELL AS SOME QUEER OVERTONES WHEREONE OF THE MARRIED MEN FALL FOR THEIR OWN SON WHO HAS NOW GROWN UP AND IS VISITING THEM IN AN ITALIAN BEACH RESORT:
4,I haven't. Finished watching it yet,I don't know what to say about this one yet.....I am hoping that attractive guy on the cover shows up soon....P.S. I do like the Mediteranean feel about the movie.
2,Could Avoid,"The story line was fine, but I didn't feel it was not executed well. The audio is a bit off throughout. It was one of those movies I kept hoping would get better, so I watched the whole way through, but it just didn't do it for me."
4,What can you say?,This is your typical pathetic closet gay story. This is why you gotta be yourself and don't hide from yourself. Serves him right is all I'm saying.
4,Hauntingly Beautiful,"This is a hauntingly beautiful story of forbidden love and passion set on the breathtaking Italian Riviera. The story gets increasingly more intense and compelling as it gets to the midpoint of the film. The final consummation of the attraction between Matteo, a handsome older married man and the Adonis-like young man, David, is bittersweet due to the film's tragic ending which leaves all the characters, as well as this viewer, in a profound state of grief and shock. There is no final resoultion of the plot because neither the characters nor the viewers can digest the reality of the tragedy that has occurred nor how David and Matteo would ever be able to talk about what they were doing when it happened."
3,Sounds a Little Bit Artificial...,"'Feel Fine' is a literally rhythmic and suitable song for summer, I suppose. However, I'm afraid this doesn't become her; it sounds pretty artificial to me. I just felt as if she managed to sing this rock music.I gave this tune 3 stars because it's up-tempo summer tune but again, sounds artificial."
5,Best vitamins in the market today,"Many of my patients ask me for a recommendation for a particular multivitamin, and I do not hesitate to recommend Dr Weil's. I find them very complete; the most popular brand in the market does no even come close to these in quality. Maybe these vitamins should be more readily aveilable."
2,shipping,"The product is Weil and it is a good product. However, I ordered this product and the Cardo support formula together in my shopping cart. They were forwarded to the company by Amazon as two separate orders and I was charged two separate shipping costs - doubling my shipping cost. I won't order this from Amazon again"
2,"TOMTOM is great, but J&Rs listing is dishonest.","The Tomtom navigator version with no cradle for your Pocket PC lists for $329. With the cradle it lists for $349. Unlike most items on Amazon, this J&R listing makes absolutely no mention of what comes in the box. I assumed that for $347 you were getting a $2 discount on the $349 version. Nope, your being charged $18 more than retail for the one without the cradle. What's worst, is that the cradle costs you $50 when bought separately from Tomtom. Avoid hassles, buy directly from Tomtom and get what you expect."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"There is plenty of research out there that ""mucoid plaque"" is a bunk myth.This product also has fake sugars added to it, but that is not in any of the advertising materials. That is something that I found really bothersome, and that led me to do much more thorough research as a result.The package did come quickly, and it is very well designed. Moreover, I bet most people feel better after going through this program! Part of the program is improving your diet, however, and juice fasting for 5 days. That'll do it! That right there cleans you out. Because of the excuse to do a valuable juice fast and the packaging, this is why I did not just give the product one star.If you would (also) like your feces to be long and stringy, since that doesn't happen naturally, you could just buy some psyllium husks and bentonite clay to ingest. That will help."
2,Perfect for tight shoes; worthless otherwise,"These would be perfect to separate toes in tight shoes, but I've given up on tight shoes. So they are too thin to be of any use and fall out of place in normal shoes. The foam toe separators work better for me.The material is soft and easy to clean.I know the details say there would only be 2 in the package but the picture shoes 8, so I was expecting more."
1,Deceiving Picture,These toe separators look like they are one unit in the picture but they are actually only 2 to a package. I thought I would get them for the whole foot.I agree with Frances Oliver's review. Not a good value and it is deceptive advertising!!I would give them a minus rating if that would have been a choice.Valerie Conger
2,too thin,I can't wear this with sandles and can't use it to sleep. You need a sock to keep this in place and it is so thin that I have to ask why bother!
4,It's Good But Too Similiar to Others,I ordered this book in hopes of obtaining a source of fresh information. I was somewhat disappointed. Yet I was pleased to find that this book was straight forward and easy to read. I'll be sharing it with many of our clients trying to collect child support in the future.
4,Very good tips on finding information about the ex,"Very slanted writing! However, it does offer some very good tips on finding out information about the ex (which might be useful before filing, during the divorce, or after if she leaves with the kid(s)). Check it out. It might be a good idea to see what you can find out about yourself so you'll know what might come up in court."
4,Worth a read,"I have read many books on this subject and this one stands out as one of my favorites. The author covers many different ""situations"" and discusses many ideas on how to collect back child support. A lot of research was put into this book and I found it all very helpful and full of interesting ideas and suggestions."
1,Essential reading......,"As unsettling as this book is, every man who is contemplating marraige should read it. You will get some idea of the forces arrayed against you when your wife decides to call it quits and move on to her next victim."
4,Bogus lifetime warranty,"This is a good product and I would have given it a five had it not been for the bogus lifetime warranty. My grinder broke after about 8 years of service and when I sent it back with the card that was enclosed with the mill for that purpose it came back as ""moved""."
4,A Great Start -- Let's See More!,"This book shows you how to manuever the tricky waters of managing client/server projects in which multi-disciplinary skill sets are required to be successful. Though it only hinted at the coming web revolution, its precepts are valuable if applied judiciously in the management of client/server development teams to bring a client/server projec in on time and on budget.And having had the privilege of working with both of the authors, I can attest to ther excellence and passion in this challenging profession.Well done! When will the second edition be ready?"
5,Have read it three times and never wanted to start it!!,"This book reads like a novel although it can be Biblically supported. The footnotes are hilarious. What is it about?? Our concept of God, religion, and practical rules for decision making on everything we encounter and struggle through in life, love and our decisions (which we may not have made on our own). I am a cradle born Episcopalian who frequently gets ""turned off"" by the locked in thinking of some Christians who are more interested in defining ""sin"" than by looking at the real point of Christianity and our creator's plans for us and our happiness. Just read it and see . . .even and especially if you hate religion. Author is a talented writer, methodical, humorous and a born teacher. Do yourself a favor and read it . . . .entertaining, informative and food for thought. I've never read anything like it, but my copy is already dog-eared! Beware: this is NOT a self-help psychobabble book and you can discuss it at all the holiday parties!"
2,my gramatical errors/Spelling errors,lot of good info although the typos and grammar errors are very distracting
3,Small tamper,Keep in mind this is a smaller tamper for smaller home type machines. For most commercial machines it's just too small
4,"Nice, but...","This isn't a bad little tamper, but for not too much more Norpro has a tamper / measuring spoon combo, with the heavy round tamper on one end and a spoon to measure out just the right amount for one cup of crema on the other. Why have a single-purpose doodad when one can take the place of two?"
1,Toy ...,"Buy a real tamper, not something designed by someone who evidently knows little about coffee making. The rounded edge is inadequate for even packing of your coffee, and without even knowing the diameter of the tamper you might as well save some cash and not pack at all. For proper extraction you have to get a tamper that fits _your_ filter."
4,Just for fun. Good fun.,"Despite a couple of not very good songs throughout the album, this one definitely steps ahead of any other Vilma Palma E Vampiros records, making it the most fun/party turn on from their career.The band is either loved or hated throughout their homeland, Argentina. No mid-terms. Some think they're just a bunch of ""cumbiamberos"" (folk-ish music players) trying hard to record a few cheesy rock mega hits, whilst others love them as if they were the impersonation of Argentina's Beatles... but none of these is really a fair enough judgement.Not much of a reflective music, neither sophisticated lyrics. Just fun, and a beautifully mastered instrumentation - listen and enjoy carefully the drums and percussion. Sometimes reggae, sometimes pop, sometimes rock, sometimes cumbia but always a good blend resulting from different influences.A pop classic, not deserving to be classified under rock anyway."
3,"seems funtional, but kind of small","Although this works, it is a real stretch to say it will hold two tubed poles. we have one 6"" tube with 4 poles in it, and it took all my strength to stretch the straps far enough to get around it. The clamps themselves are plastic and seem fairly flimsy. I think this might work ok with a single 4"" tube. It looks like the plastic should be heavier thickness for the part that clamps over the top of the window. It's very thin and I doubt if it will survive for long. Great idea, but I would say if you are looking for a long term hauling solution, I am skeptical this will even last for a dozen trips. The suction cups that stick to the glass seem to work ok, but again, they seem to be pretty small and flimsy. This is not what I would consider good enough quality for any kind of continued use.Update:Almost made it through the track season, but a strap finally broke. Was able to order replacement straps via Amazon and they were here in 2 days - well done."
5,"Seeing the Mouth live is always the best, but...","Everyone says nothing compares to seeing Cowboy Mouth live, and that's all true. While more recent albums (Uh-Oh, Voodoo Shoppe) have been getting more polished, Fred's live shows are truly unmatched. That said, this live album does a great job capturing the feel of a live Cowboy Mouth concert...close your eyes and you can imagine rockin' at the Southern Comfort Stage at Jazz Fest, the Howlin' Wolf in the New Orleans Warehouse District, or wherever else you like to catch Mouth concerts. The set list flows well and covers some of their best material. All Mouth fans should own this album."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Sorry to say, but this album is not as good as I expected it to be. It's not even close to the same as seeing them live. And frankly, I'm most disappointed because it was poorly recorded. I've been to a number of cowboy mouth concerts, and they just don't sound nearly as good on this CD as they do in real life. I heard Fred sing The Foot of Canal Street earlier this summer and it was spectacular; on this CD, however, it was just disappointing. Buy their studio albums and see them live, but pass on this CD."
4,The MOUTH of the south and beyond...,"While I agree with an earlier comment that this CD does not encapsulate the true sound of Cowboy Mouth live, what recording possibly can?? Any live concert recording will always come up short of the unadulterated energy these guys produce live. I've seen this band in concert at least a dozen times and this CD is the next best thing. I'll take this over the radio-friendly 'Easy', although I bought 'Easy' the day it was released. ;-) Get this CD and get to a live performance on the Southern Comfort tour. The music produced by this band defies a single categorization which makes it a truly unique New Orleans 'gumbo' band. 4 1/2 Stars."
5,the name of the band is...COWBOY MOUTH!,"My all-time favorite band, playing some of my all-time favorite songs (my favorite album is Are You With Me?). The live versions on this album have grown on me to the point where I prefer them to the album cuts. I have three live CM albums (including the DVD) and I like this one the best."
2,Degrades Video Picture Quality,"I've owned this receiver for three years now. I bought it to use as both an audio receiver and a video switcher. At first it was great, but after about 6 months I noticed some serious degradation in the picture quality - dark picture with serious horizontal waves. At first I thought it was poor cable reception or a problem with the television or cable connections, however I've traced the problem to the internal receiver. The sound quality is still fine. I've wired a work around that's acceptable, but defeats the purpose of buying a home theater receiver to handle all of the source selection. I'm sure Sony can come up with a better quality video switcher for a high end product."
4,There is a paradise...,"I love their live shows. A lot's of energy going on. My favorite song on this album is ""ballad of pure thought""!"
2,Ho Hum,"This is the third DK Touch and Feel book I have bought for our toddler. My son (at 20 months) is already bored with the book after only one day. When you buy one Touch and Feel book you have bought them all as there is redundancy in the textures. (I love all other DK books other than the Touch and Feel series.) By toddler ages, children want to touch and feel the real thing anyway."
3,Go for volume 1,"This book has very good pictures but doesn't really touch the building process, I would recomend the first volume of this series, that book does explain with more detail the construction process, washes, drybrushing, etc. Other than that you will see incredible models in the three volumes."
2,unuseful with 12 V pump,"The description said it is good for pumps too.....it is not !does not even turn onIt may be used with phone or other chargers , but this is not whatI ordered it for ."
1,Didn't work,The light would turn on but my car lighter pump would not work. I tried every outlet in my house and no luck.
2,Not enough power output,"I got this to power a radar detector. It wasn't working. I called customer support. They said I needed 1,000MA of output. This only puts out 500MA. Useless to me now."
4,Good Devotional,"I really enjoy Tozer, and appreciate his no-fluff approach. Great devotional! I prefer the Mornings with Tozer, which appears to be the same exact book with the addition of a prayer at the end of each devotion. Nothing against this seller or the book, just saying I didn't realize they were the same. The book was exactly what I ordered and in the condition I expected."
2,Shipped wrong filter,"Measures approximately 8"" H x 6"" ID x 11 1/2"" OD.I'm not sure how much leeway they use when they say approximately. Filter was suppose to be 8""h, it was only 6""h.I can not use this filter"
1,Why the price?,"This book costs ten times more in Spanish than in English... why is this if the authors are all Hispanics, are they so americanize that they don't want the latin-america community to have easy access to their books or are they scare of insulting their people in their own language?Not worthy"
1,If only I could give it a negative star...,"This book is ridiculous. Unscholarly and laced with neoliberal rhetoric, this is the bias information produced when history is written from the top down.If your going to use your hours reading up on the subject of collapsed democracy within Latin American countries I would recommend instead: John Perkin's, ""Confession of an Economic Hitman,"" Walter LaFeber's ""Inevitable Revolutions,"" Eduardo Galeano's ""Open Veins of Latin America,"" Greg Grandin's ""Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism"" or Noam Chomsky's ""Turning the Tide."""
1,Ha ha ha!!!!!,"I am writing this on October 25, 2008. It is about 6 weeks since the biggest financial crash since 1929 got started, and more's to come.And I think of some of the little gems written by the threesome authors of this book.""The Market, with its winners and losers, is the only economic justice possible.""And ""It is not the state but individuals who create wealth.""And I can only say back to them, ""HA HA HA!""So some big banks have crashed, and retirees have lost big chunks of their savings. They are the losers, and of course that is ""the only economic justice possible""!Meanwhile, those terrible States worldwide have poured in over a TRILLION dollars just to rescue that ""wealth"" created by individuals. I have heard virtually no report of free-market economists being opposed to that gargantuan instance of GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION!The Idiot book and its sequel, EL REGRESO DEL IDIOTA, are quickly becoming outdated by real events!"
1,An idiot book,"The book is historically wrong, out of focus, and misquotes just about everyone. Indeed, I feel like an idiot for having bought and tried to read it."
4,Won't be availiable forever....get it now,"I saw this ""Picks"" at JR Musicworld for over $50......so considering what Amazon is selling it for......and the fact that Dead.Net doesn't have it in CD form.......so get it if you want.....its worth it....."
4,The title says it all,"This album ain't for the weak or timid. These English weirdos have brought their message from the gutter yet again to unleash on an unsuspecting world. The listener, who may not be familiar with the group, may not understand at first and wonder if there is actually music on this CD that falls within the boundaries of what the human ear can withstand. Fear not, Barf is at their best when the audience is most confused. Need to liven up a party? Want to impress that first date? Barf will get results, as unpredictable as the band themselves."
2,Wow- -Unbelievably Bad,"Like the title says--Unbelievably Bad. Its an official companion to the show, and it sucks. Bit Me--An Unofficial Guide is so much better and much more worth the money. This is pretty much straightforward, spoiler packed, boring takes on the show and its characters. Bit Me, has interesting things about each episode, such as mistakes to look for, while this, just tells about each episode and goes on to the next. This has half page summaries of the characters, while Bite Me has sever pages per, including a summary of Buffy from the Movie to the planning of the show, all the way through the change of networks. i must say, this was one of the most worthless things I've ever bought."
4,Just What I Expected,"Being a huge fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" I was glad to pick up this book. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes pictures. It's great to see the people who bring ""Buffy"" to life. Any Buffy fan should enjoy this book. The book is full of quotes, and has an episode guide."
3,Wrong battery,"All in all service was good, packed well, arrived on time but the enclosed battery does not fit the LG-4010 phone so was of no value."
3,Healing is a unusual live performance choice.,Not as fun as Todd but still a good performance there. Great interview with Roy Firestone as well. Its almost a meditation.in concert.
3,"Too much war, too little other.....","Olivia and Alex are back together miraculously, and maybe even more so, Matthew and Chrystal are together. The civil war is raging turning family against family. I suppose all the descriptions were necessary, but personally I am ready to move on to more peaceful scenes. That is the reason for the reduction of stars. Now if I can just get this series in some kind of order....."
3,An above-average first novel,"While this is a fine first effort, it's not the great Samoan novel that the other reviewers seem to think it is. It's definitely written for a Samoan audience--much of the cultural and linguistic info is not adequately explained for palagis (that's Samoan for white folk). I'm a palagi who lived in Samoa for two years, so I was able to follow and understand some of the fa'aSamoa aspects of the book, but I think most non-Samoans would find much of the novel baffling. That said, it is nicely written, and the fairly predictable coming-of-age story rings true. I look forward to reading future works by the author, who will no doubt mature into a better Samoan writer than the grand old man of Samoan lit, Albert Wendt. As a palagi observer of Polynesia, I'm happy to see that a new generation of Samoan authors are continuing to add to the written tradition of what was once a purely oral culture."
5,Wonderfully realistic!,"This book really let me into the life of the character. It is undeniably realistic. As a student, I am planning on studying in Samoa for a semsester and this book did a great job with portraying yet another perspective on the Samoan way of life. And the perspective of a teenage girl going through adolescent confusion is always fascinating!"
2,Sold out to Smooth Jazz radio,"I've been a Larry Carlton fan for many years and I've seen a number of musicians change styles and try innovative things. As I listened to this several times to try to see what he was saying I realized the answer was ""nothing"". This seems to be a CD released to satisfy a contract. There is no heart and soul that I hear on most of Larry's other albums. This is Smooth Jazz drivel."
2,pass on it,"I bought this book and it is ok. Mr. fresh gives some good advice but it lacks alot of detail. He says to go up to woman and do what is called a ""controlled conflict"". This is basically pissing a girl off then winning her back. Maybe in PA where he is from this might work, but in socal this would get you into some serious trouble. He also says to catch up on current events and""chick shows"" so you will have good convo material. He also says not to spoil woman. I went through it in about 30 minutes.I am still looking for a good dating book. Good luck fellas."
3,A humourous guide to women!,"This is a great book to help us guys with women.Its written with humour and is a sensible guide to learning more about women in a social situation.I also recommend the following books:1)""Date out of your league:for men only"" By April Masini.2)""How to pick up beautiful women:secrets every man should know know"".By John Eagan.3)""U.S.S."" By Leil Lowndes(means:undercover sex signals).You can find more books on ""dating"",picking up girls"",etc from this site."
5,Excellent book! Funny yet informative at the same time.,"A great book! I wish I had this a long time ago, I would have had a lot more fun through high school and college. Whether you shy or aggressive; this book is for everyone. It is informative as well as fun to easy to read. Technology has changed in the dating world and this book give pointers on how to keep up with it. Most of the tips the author presents are the unspoken proven ""secrets"" that successful dating men have been using for years to meet women. It's about time someone printed them up! The author goes over everything from how to meet women, where to meet them, what they want in a relationship, and much more. Oh yeah, Chapter 99 is hilarious."
1,Non-Science from a Non-Scientist,"Some people never learn. Not since Lowell and his ""canals"" has one man engaged in so much wild speculation based on the flimsiest of data. Any pattern can be found in a large enough collection of random data. Happens on Earth all the time. I've kayaked rivers all over North America and can show you a car, a cow's head, and even the face of Ronald Reagan, all scuplted from the native rock by natural forces, and without intelligent intervention. Just a few hours north of where I live there is a quite famous natural rock formation in the shape of an old man's face. (Appropriately enough, it is named the ""Old Man in the Mountain"", and appears on the New Hampshire state quarter.) Given the surface area of Mars, the only real mystery is that *more* familiar formations haven't been found. Give it time..."
4,Well done Richard!,"After reading all the reviews, both good and not so good, I decided to pick this up and see what all the fuss was about. Well all I can say is, and coming from a well educated person, I thought this was a very good read. I then went out to see the movie Mission to Mars, and it really blew me away. I can now see what Richard was trying to say in his book. Thanks and Aloha! - Brian, Webmaster, Art Director booklineshawaii.com"
1,Fake Editorial Reviews.,"Just wanted to point out the fairly obvious; Here's the ""Editorial Review"" in question:""I'm sure you're aware of the extremely grave potential for cultural shock and social disorientation contained in this present situation, if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning.""--Heywood Floyd, Head, The National Council of Astronautics, 2001Dr. Heywood Floyd is a fictional character in Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey canon. The quote is from the movie version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It seems fairly fitting to have a fictional character write a fictional review for a work of fiction, written by a fictional scientist."
4,Seeing is Believing,"The most compelling part of Dr. Hoaglands thesis that Mars contains structures that were intelligently designed is by far the pictures. He ads to this stunning visual evidence with mathematical evidence, that, while more obscure, is equally compelling. I would quarrel a bit with his conclusion that they must have been put their by a civilization that didn't originally come from there.The jury really should be out on whether Mars ever supported intelligent life. When/If humans ever get there and start doing some archaelogy, then you can say. But the point is made over and over again in his book that there are many anomalies on Mars that can only be artificial."
3,1/ (Resonable Doubt),Well.... the decision is yours. The Avebury region map overlay on Cydonia is hard to dismiss as coincidence. I just may take a visit to Stonehenge and check it out myself. The Brilliant Pebbles testing broadcast was also quite interesting.
1,give me a break!,"Fifth Edition already? Can you say CON ARTIST? Hoagland must KNOW he's making this stuff up. It isn't real. The ""Face"" landform looks NOTHING like a face at high spatial resolution in the Mars Global Surveyor images. There is NO coverup at NASA, they couldn't keep a secret if their future depended on it. Did you know the word GULLIBLE isn't in the dictionary?"
1,Skip it.,"This is a difficult text to read. Not well organized. Theories are scattered with very little support. Conjecture abounds. Richard C. Hoagland was expelled from mainstream science for a reason, the evidence is within this text."
1,Pure huckster drivel...,"I rate this ""book"" a ""1"" only because I am not permitted to rate it a ""0"". Hoagland is a master huckster and public relations professional with real and credible connections to the military, intelligence, and Hollywood creative community (as do Art Bell and Ed Dames of Psitech).However, Hoagland would have us believe that the same institutions are part of a secret, sinister clique of Freemasons who are direct descendents of ancient Egyptians who were visited by Martians thousands of years ago. Does this sound like the plot of the film and current TV series ""Stargate""? You bet it does. Reading Hoagland's previous work will also remind you of the storylines of ""Mars Attacks..."" and ""Independence Day"", too.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this book. Listen to Hoagland's nonsense on Art Bell's show for free and take him as seriously as you would a used car salesmen.Drivel to the nth degree."
1,The Lonliest Psuedo Scientist in the World,"It must be very lonesome for R.C. Hoagland being the only sane scientist in the world. Afterall, he IS the only ""self-described"" scientist in the world who didn't admit defeat in this case when the recent Mars photo's showed nothing more than martian landscape contours etc. Well, then again, 33 masons involved in 19.5 coverups within NASA might be capable of an ongoing cover-up of this magnitude.Maybe R.C. should stop leaching from the poor zealots in New Mexico and get a real job like the rest of us. What does he say when they ask for rent... ""Well, you see, 33 Masons took my last 19.5 thousand dollars from book sales so I can't pay rent this month. But if you put me up for another month I might be able to pay you- that is if those pesky masons don't get my royalty check first."""
5,"Finally, someone with guts and a brain.","Richard C. Hoagland is a complete genius, his writtings confirm the belief of many other highly thought of and scientifically credible individuals. From a quick once over of the reviews here, it's quite clear to see that the majority are in complete favor of such a wonderful title that deals with the absolute facts of what sits waiting at Cydonia. GET THIS BOOK! Well done Richard! :))"
1,"Please, will you para-abnormal mindless people get a life!","Another example of ""if you write it, someone will believe it"""
1,Must be lonesome out there.,"It must be very lonesome for R.C. Hoagland being the only sane scientist in the world.

4,The Beginners Guide to Access 2.0 Wrox Development,great reference book. gives good details. perfect for beginers!
3,Can Hardly Wait Until I'm finished!,"It's very difficult for me to ""get into"" this story since I don't like the reader. I know I am supposed to write on the content of the book, but the reader takes away from the content. I keep thinking it will get better, but it doesn't. I think I would like the story, if it were read by someone else. Very disappointing."
2,New Video iPod is Buggy,"*Update* After writing the 2 star review shown below, I returned my faulty iPod to Amazon and received a replacement. The replacement does not seem to have the skipping problem, which I thus presume was an isolated hardware problem.I just received my 60 Gig Video iPod (White), and unfortunately it is a little buggy. I loaded my music collection (51 gigs) onto the device, and the first thing I noticed is that it wouldn't turn off when I hit the off button. After a reset, it would then turn off. Next, the songs randomly quit playing right in the middle and skip to the next song on the list. This problem happens with multiple songs, all of which play fine on my trusty old 40 gig unit. Perhaps a software release will fix these issues soon; if not, mine is going to be returned for a refund."
1,Why buy iPod and waste time to convert media files ???,"It seems that iPod is too good at branding. And with a BIG EGO to invent it's own media file formats different than mainstream MP3, jpg, wmv and mp4. It's just bad usability. Have you iPod users ever used other brands ? All others NEVER need to convert file format. iPod is a waste of time and life."
1,Rip-off,"We paid $600 when we bought this I-pod for our son in 2004. After less than two years use it completely crashed. Of course it was out of warranty. It was never dropped or abused in any way -- our son is an adult who took good care of it. Many others have told us of similar complaints. No one repairs an I-pod, it's too expensive. I think this is a rip-off by a company that promises a user-friendly product. Neither we nor or son will buy another one."
3,Amazing product but fell short of my expectations,"Before purchasing this product I did research on all iPods and knowing what I would be using it for I felt this Apple 60 GB iPod would be my best choice. Ordering and delivery was the easiest part of my purchase. When it arrived I read the booklet I received and inserted my disc into the computer. Nothing goes accordingly....I went on many web-sites to get the real scoop on the problems I was having. After 2 days of reading printed our material from other people I was able to use my ipod. Within a month it was not working. I went back to the booklet and found the toubleshooting section and have now had to reset this ipod several times to get it to work. I bought all the horns and whistles to enhance it (extra battery, cover, new-earphones, Bose speaker and the list goes on)I am not disappointed in the technology of this amazing little piece of machinery but I do think there are a few bugs that need fixing."
5,This is a great digital music player!,"This is a great music player. It work well. It is also easy to use. I have news for you. When the iPod says do not diconnect you have to go to iTunes and eject the iPod. Read the Adobe iPod features guide to learn more about that stuff.(It comes on the installation CD.) I recently had the Creative Zen Portable Media Center. I didn't even have it for a year and it broke. It might have been defective. Though this iPod is smaller and lighter. They pretty much do the same thing. If you want a small music player, a photo viewer, and a video player get the iPod Video 60GB. It is the 5th generation of the iPod."
1,"iPod is OK, just don't buy from Amazon....","I ordered and received the 60GB iPod from Amazon three days ago. Everything was going fine until the device locked up. After going online to Apple ""help"", re-loading software and attempting to reset it a dozen times, I gave up and called Apple tech support. I'm well within my 90 day free tech support window. Apple told me that since I bought it from Amazon, they had no way to know when it shipped, so NO TECH SUPPORT! BUYER BEWARE, if you purchase this from Amazon, you are giving up your 90 days of free Apple tech support. I'm not sure if I should be mad at Amazon or Apple ;-) !!"
4,Love iPod but take time to master it,"The video and sound quality are really good. I like it.Some designs are not intutive so it takes time to make iPods do what you want.For example, to fast forward a audio book, you will need to press the center of the wheel ""once"". Be patient, wait for few seconds until the diamond appear, then turn the wheel.Sometimes, iPod will stop playing in the middle of the audio book. After you re-try, you will need to fast-forward agin. A bit annoying since bookmarking doesn't always work.Actually, 3 of my friends break iPod wheels in a year. I think the main reason is the not-so-intutive design that make you unnecessarily press (abuse) the wheels more than needed and end up breaking it.If iPod screen can show something like ""Working on bla bla....be patient..."" after you press the wheel, most iPods' lives can be saved."
1,YOU SUCK!,THIS GUY SOLD ME A PRODUCT THAT DOESN'T EVEN WORK. SENT IT IN TO APPLE AND THEY COULDN'T EVEN FIX... YOU SUCK!!
3,"Nice, but not w/o problems","I've had several minis for 3+ years and have had very few problems. In the 4 months I've had had this 60 GB it has frozen 3-4 times requiring the ""5R"" treatment including wiping the thing clean and reloading all the songs back on.The wheel also sustained a crack in the plastic while it was in a very sturdy case in a padded pocket in my purse. This is odd because I only use my ipod on my my commute for less than an hour a day and am quite meticulous about its care.The best part is the more-than-ample space for my music. My kids are disgusted that I have a video iPod (they don't), yet I refuse to buy videos. This iPod should give me space for the next few years if it lasts that long."
3,"Good, not great.","The 60gb is good, but if you need more memory I highly recommend you max out your storage needs and get the 160gb version. I now sync every month or so. Can't beat that."
4,Awesome...,"I've been an iPod user since I bought a 5gb way back in '02, and they just keep getting better! I have owned a 60GB white 5th gen iPod for several months now, and I'm very very pleased with it. I use it for upwards of three hours a day, since I not only have all my music on it, but lots of TV shows, podcasts and audibooks. I also recently bought the AV connection kit, and use that to watch my TV shows from the iPod on my TVThings I like about it:* Easy to use and look good* Excellent sound quality if you encode your music at a high bitrate and use a decent set of headphones* Plays TV programs on my TV with surprisingly good quality* iTunes is awesome - probably my prime reason for sticking with the iPod* Podcast support is wonderful - I look forward to new episodes every time I use the iPod (I'm a Scott Sigler junkie too)Things I don't like so much:* Poor battery life if using the backlight* 60GB ain't enough for me now, but that's not the iPods fault.."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I bought this ipod to replace one that had a failed hard drive. As with my previous ipod, setup was a breeze and everything worked as planned. I haven't played with the photo or video capability but I assume they work well too. My only complaint/suggestion is that I wish there was an easier way to switch from shuffle to linear(?) play mode. I often don't know exactly what I'm in the mood for so I'll be driving along listening in shuffle mode (via a cassette player adapter)and then I'll hear something I like and will want to hear the whole album. Unfortunately it's too cumbersome to switch out of shuffle mode while I'm driving, so I wind up continuing to listen in shuffle mode, slightly disappointed that I can't hear more of the desired album. All in all, I suppose that's a minor complaint. Now stop reading these reviews and complete your purchase already..."
1,Worst money I ever spent,"I bought the iPod 60 GB White and could not wait to use it. I charged it and loaded up about 1000 songs and had problems from that point on. The iPod had great sound and performance. After the battery ran completely down I tried to recharge it and it locked up. I rebooted it and charged it. The locking up happens everytime the battery runs down. After 6 months the iPod would not reboot and for $140.00 apple will fix it but with no guarantee that this will not happen again. No thanks, I will not ever buy an iPod again..."
2,Watch Out for Used or Refurbished Models,"I bought my 60GB Video IPod over the internet, ""refurbished."" While I was satisfied with most of my IPod's attributes initially, it took awhile before I realized how poor the battery life was. Most frustrating was the fact that the battery was drained of all power after a few days even when it was off. If I actually played the thing, it also didn't match the promised 20 hours battery life, more like 3-4. What surprised me the most was how difficult the Ipod was to use compared with my previous MP3 player, a Creative Zen Jukebox. There is no way to browse through a playlist or other category, which I missed a lot. I think Apple has a good product, but one that it has brilliantly (and falsely) marketed as being so much better than its competitors."
4,ipod,"i've been using this ipod for two and a half years now, and i just started having slight problems with the headphone jack now. as other people have said, it definitely doesn't fit 15,000 songs-- i have about 13,000 with nothing else on it-- but that's still an awful lot. i've definitely been really happy with this ipod & it's held up to a lot of wear & tear, so no complaints, really. it's heavier & thicker than the newer ones, but totally works just as well."
4,great,what can i say about an ipod everybody has one. this one also plays mp4 video. wish it also played .avi video but not too big deal. 60gb is a ton of storage
4,This actually works!,"I diidn't have high expectations, but just placing it between my toes straightens my big toe enough to releive the pain of my bunion. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's a little uncomfortable, however it's hard to complain when it actually allows me to wear so many more shoes!"
3,work the price,"These are just barely worth the price. Its about the same is sticking gummy bears between your toes, except these things will stay fresh longer."
3,"friend recommended,","too early to tell. if it will have any long term good.. . doesn't feel good on one foot that has the less severe bunion..on the foot that has the worse one, it stays put ( with socks only) and feels comfortable."
1,falls right out,I've owned this product for quite some time and do not find it useful at all. It slips right out from between my toes and just overall is NOT EFFECTIVE.
3,Slightly effective as long as kept w/talcum powder,"I have these in LARGE to use as bunion relief, they tend to irritate and chafe my toes a bit after prolonged use but I've found that if I apply talcum powder frequently PROBLEM SOLVED. The bunion relief is quite minimum but better than nothing. For lasting relief you may want to try the Bunion Aid Hinged Splint for prolonged use, like I will soon. Once I've had it a while I will post a review in the hopes of guiding others in their search of pain relief. Hope this helps."
2,Too small to make a difference,"I have small feet, only 8.5 male size, but these are too small even for me to feel anything. If your feet are severely deformed, than this little a stretch may be the way to start healing them but for normal people with healthy feet these will not give much of a stretch. Also, the package only contains 2 pads instead of 4, so you can only stretch a few toes at a time, not your whole feet."
5,very helpful,"These small toe spacers are great. They fit comfortably, stay in place and don't cause my shoes to fit more tightly when I wear them. I have worn them when I go jogging and they stay put and relieve my foot pain. Highly recommend."
2,Gel Toe Spacers move,"The Gel spacers feel great, but do not stay in place very well: They may be good if your toes are really tight, but I had to strap mine inplace with tape: which kind of defeated the purpose of buying them in the first place."
2,Be aware,"Just be aware that these do not arrive as shown in the ad. They come in generic plastic bags with no Pedifix identification, so you only have the sellers word that they are Pedifix. I expect to get what I am shown."
3,Right size for between my third toe and my pinky toe - but couldn't keep it there for long!,"These clear, silcone toe spacers were the right size between my third toe and pinky toe, however I had a very hard time keeping it there."
2,"Small, wobbly, not very durable","These spaces don't really provide for much ""spacing"" as they are quite small and squishy. They will only space your toes apart <1/4 inch. They are soft, but the softness compromises the durability, as the vertical sides seem to ""flake off"" from wear. They are very comfortable and sometimes I forget I'm wearing them, but be warned that they will not always stay in place very well and they will last maybe one month before they begin to flake away."
2,Don't really work well because of design,"The design of this toe space, like so many others, doesn't really work because there is nothing to keep the spacer in place once inserted between the toes. With each step it migrate farther out of place. Simply, it's ineffective without taping it or using some other method to keep it from moving. Don't waste your money on something like this. Find a toe space that includes an attachment of some sort to keep it in place. Saving money by purchasing a cheaper, poorly designed alternative isn't saving money at all."
3,A Comfy Toe Spacer,"This is a comfortable, clean way to help align toes. Because this particular model is quite thick, you may find its primary application is as a spacer for your big toe. I've used mine for weeks now. I wash and dry them each day and have found them to be durable."
3,Pediflex,Not sure if they work but they seem to make a few pair of my shoes more comfortable. Easy to use and not irritating.
1,Not Helpful At all,"These toe spacers just annoyed me. I have mild bunions and want to take good care of them so they don't get worse, but I couldn't stand to have these on my feet more than 20 minutes. Didn't hurt, were just irritating/annoying."
3,"Okay, but worse than expected.","I received these in a plastic bag (like a jewelry bag). They look different than these. They are a little small to actually push my big toe away from the others, so they keep falling out. Maybe they would work better for someone with minor bunions; my big toes slightly go underneath my 2nd toe. They should be $3.50. However, they are decent."
5,Beautiful Swarovski Crystal Pearl Beads,This is a wonderful deal for all of these Swarovski Crystal Pearls. I love to use these pearls to make jewelry and these are very good quality and very lustrous.
2,pretty bad and that is good,"Written in 1966, I say it was left over from the 50's. It reads like the children's serialized science fiction, Rocky Jones with a little Edgar Rice Burroughs thrown in with the Martian characters.The action is swift and superficial with missing spaceships, colliding planets, and golly gee that's some swell dialogue by an author who knows his onions."
2,slate tables,This photo is very misleading. The table legs are gold with stripes of black and what is described as slate top is black tile. The photo showes the tables very light with a light slate but that is not the case with the product we received.
4,Relaxing inspirational,"Love the music, something to make you relax with the haunting celtic tunes. Cannot wait to buy volumes II & III."
1,not worth it,Pretty flimsy for a Kitchenaid tool. Plastic construction not sturdy enough to efficiently grate parmesan cheese. Too much work with this tool!
4,WOW!!,I cannot believe how well she captures the feelings experienced by women who have abortions. I heard her speak years ago and was very moved by her dedication to the subject. I bought the book out of curiosity and it was such a catharsis for me. Every woman who has had an abortion should read this book. Every teenager who thinks no-one understands them should read this book.
2,wide angle attachmemt,"There were no surprises in how the lens worked, but the assembly was not very good. The lens cover is so loose that, unless you hold it on when handling the lens, it will fall of... always gets stuck in the bag.When I replaced the lens cover with an old filter-case cover, It fit well, but then it pulled the lens keeper ring out of the metal casing and broke the little toy keeper stubs...glue fixd that.Yeah, the expected chromatic ""fringing"" happens, but some soft settings and underexposure followed by Adobe fix that."
1,A horrid book!,"Eerie in every sense, with too-bright illustrations, a menacing subtext, and just plain strange, this story seems to me to be a distortion of the world and nothing like a children's book. Dreadful!"
5,another great one !,This series never fails to wrap it's self around me & take me to another place . I adore this series !
4,Radio drama,This series of Cape Cod mysteries are good for people just trying out reading on audio as they have all the differnt voices and sound effects. These are well done.
5,A SUSPENSFUL THRILLER!!!,"I liked the way this story goes back and forth from different point of views, a different person each chapter. This book is very suspensful and kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved this book so much, I started reading other books in this seris and became addicted. I give it two thumbs up!!!!!"
4,This book should be a 4 and a half stars.,"This was a great book. It was thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat. I read it in one sitting. If your thinking about buying this book for your kids it's great for ages 12 to adult. The book is about disease striking adults, and leaving teenagers to rule the world. (Pretty scary thought, eh?) I can't wait to buy the sequel."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!,I thought the book sucked so much. The ending was so retarded and every chapter was just like the one before. There was bad detail and the different plot changes were very confusing. There were too many characters in different settings to remember. I can't believe i wasted my time reading such a boring book.
3,intriguing/suprised,"I bought this book for my classroom, but found it inappropriate for my class library. The discussion about sex, drugs, and alcohol are inappropriate for some teenagers. As an adult, I thought the stories are riviting and suspensful. I plan on reading the entire series for myself."
2,Wish they had more features,"I went ahead since I was on a dice kick to look into learning to play the Chinese dice game, Sic Bo. I found it through Amazon and ordered it for the whopping cost of a penny. It was worth the penny (well there was s&h of about five bucks) but that was it. I was disappointed because the game didn't allow for any changes in the settings nor an explanation for the payoffs. I had to research that on the internet."
5,Great flash light,"I have had mags, sure fire and stream lights my whole career in law enforcement and found the best deal on this poly stinger for my 16 year olds truck. You never ever need to be without a good flashlight any where u go."
3,a little disappointing.,"These are clearly the poorest quality dvds, Too bad, the movies are usually so much better. These selections are like the bad B side of a record..even with the great comedy of Mantan Moreland."
5,always watched charlie chan when i was a kid,i remember watching sidney toler (the best charlie chan actor) for years with his one line chinese comments ..... most on the number sons.....then i finally went to amazon to buy the sets ....glad i did.....if you are a fan its a must do!
3,not the best of chan,"I am a big fan of Charlie Chan whether it is Warner Oland or Sidney Toler. This particular set is a double dip from an earlier release (The Chanthology)and is missing Meeting at Midnight, the sixth Chan in that set. These were made at Monogram studios (someone correct me if I'm wrong) after the bigger studio let the Chan series drop (Warner Bros.?). The point being that the chintzy-ness of the studio budget really shows in these productions. Sets, lighting, etc. - everything is second-rate. The Mantan Moreland edge to comedy may strike viewers as offensive and the other Chan sidekicks are not always great. I own these because I own all the Chans (even the other set that is offered here) which is even worse. But if you are a fan of the 30's/40's mystery series such as Wong, Moto, the Saint and the Thin Man, then you will probably want these in your collection."
3,What company is releasing the movies,"To the earlier poster, it was Fox that dropped the Charlie Chan series in WWII. A lot of the majors dropped their B movie divisions during the war. Mr Moto ended in 1939 while Sherlock Holmes only after two movies was dropped in 1940 only to be picked up by Universal. Which was B studio during the war with A&C.;Does anybody what company is releasing the movies as MGM own(ed?) the rights? The packaging screams Mill Creek or a public domain company so don't expect a legitamate remastering or any extras. I know TCM/Warners released Chan four movies as well so did MGM sell part of the catalogue or they just leasing the movies out to other distributors? There is similar package for Vincent Price (mostly the Corman/Poe movies) that was also owned by MGM. I would like to know."
3,Wishing Fox Could Release this Set,"I too am surprised that only five of the six films in the Chanthology are in this set. I'm guessing the reason for the re-release is that the Chanthology has been out of print for a few years. I got it for Xmas a couple of years ago. The person who got it had to buy a used one online. Warner Bros probably wants to get in on the renewed interest in the Chan series following the success of the Fox releases. Fox did a great job on the Chans it released. They cleaned up dark spots from damaged film and stabilized shaky parts, among other things. They also included great documentaries on each disc. Unfortunately Fox doesn't own the Monogram Chans. It would be great if they could get a hold of them and give those films a proper treatment. Or perhaps Warner Bros should turn the project over to people who really love old films like these and want to mimic Fox's efforts. MGM released the Chanthology and TCM/Warner Bros the other Monogram set."
5,Don't Miss This book.....,"It took me 13 years as a Buddhist to buy this book. I should have bought it years ago. A must, helpful and informative read for anyone of any religion. A must read."
5,Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness,"The book arrived quickly, was in good condition, and I really like the price. The book is a very good book about Metta, the Buddhist practice of loving kindness for oneself and all others."
5,One of my all-time favorite books!!,"Lovingkindness : The Revolutionary Art of Happiness by Sharon Salzberg is by far one of the best books ever written. And contrary to what others have said in their reviews, I believe that this book can be read by anyone. If meditation makes you uncomfortable, thing of it as a positive affirmation. Ms. Salzberg teaches us how to appreciate life and those around us. It really is a great book: one of three that I always keep by my bedside and refer to frequently! I highly, highly recommend it!!"
3,Review of Lovingkindness,"I've just taken a class in Mindfulness Meditation and this was on the booklist that the teacher handed out. The book is not quite what I expected. I'm not a Buddhist and haven't studied Buddhism which is pretty much what the book is based on. I thought it might be more practical. Certainly, we should all strive to have more lovingkindness in our lives. If you've studied Buddhism, I think this book would be for you. For me, there just wasn't enough in it that I could grasp onto to get me there."
4,The water is hot again.,"Was not very happy when the elements went out in the water heater.I ordered these from amazon and after a bit of a fight to remove the old elements...these screwed right in,and now I can go back to regular showering,lol...great price also compared to my local hardware stores,got two of these for less than one local."
4,worked great,Works very well.The only thing is that we still have the smell. do you know how to get rid of the smell when they wear out?
3,"Good product, but not great","I wanted a good solid plastic table that I could use for my computer service business. I thought this was going to be just the ticket. It's well built, but the table top sags under the weight of a standard desktop computer and bows towards the center. This means that a keyboard won't lay flat, making it a pain to use. If you just want a card table or a table for extra people to sit during a family gathering meal, this would work fine."
3,No assembly required - wrong!,"The quality of the resin table top is typical Lifetime terrific. The size of the top is slightly larger than a card tale which is also terrific. So far so good! However, when I pulled it out of the box several screws fell to the floor. These screws should have been attached to secure the legs. I did put them in, but they don't seem to tighten completely. So, even though the legs are attached to the top, they are wobbly and I'll have to have someone check if the screws are the proper size and/or what to do to stabilize the table. Disappointing."
2,Disappointed with how tacky it looks,"I currently have 4 black vinyl folding tables for card playing... and I love them, but they can get holes in them with cat claws and stuff... so I bought one of these to see if I could replace all tables with them.The table a bit rounded rather than exactly square and the surface has ""Lifetime"" engraved in it on the top twice... pretty large, too. It looks like fairly stable but tacky outdoor furniture. I was sad. :-("
5,Love this table.,"So far, I'm impressed with the table. it's very sturdy and will be great for Mah Jong and Poker."
3,Lifetime card table,The table is very sturdy but it is hard to fold the legs back in. It is also quite heavy to manage.
5,"Good quality, good price",The table was a gift to someone else. It appears to be well made and quite sturdy. It will be used outside and looks to be easy to keep clean. I would like to see it offered in a darker color also. I plan on getting one for myself this spring.
4,Heavy duty,Not the best looking table but quality and strudiness are impressive and light weight. I use a peice of felt between the table top and talbe cloth to deaden the sound of the hollow table top.
4,Difficult book but great topic coverage,"Solid coverage of proofs relating to Fermat's Last Theorem up to Kummer's Theory. You will find proofs for n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=7. Requires solid background in Algebraic Number Theory. For example, you should already have a good understanding of the Quadratic Law of Reciprocity, Quadratic Fields, and Congruences. If you don't, I recommend Elementary Number Theory for Congruences and the Quadratic Law of Reciprocity and Stark's An Introduction to Number Theory for Quadratic Fields. I would also recommend starting out with Edward's Book on Fermat's Last Theorem which includes detailed coverage of Kummer's Theory."
3,Mr Potato Head,It will please my son but it wasn't mint.It had white stuff all over it but all the pieces were there.
3,Not for hard surfaces.,"Photo looked like it was made for hard floors, but it is not. I had no problems returning them to the company, which did not carry any similar wheels for hard floors. I ended up finding/buying a set at Staples for hard floors which worked."
3,Poor design,"Using it as a controller for Line 6 M9.Works fine, but I dislike the design. The part underneath your foot is open and about two inches at its widest point. The spring, pot and wires are visible and you can stick your fingers in there or store snacks for winter. I really don't want dust, dirt or what have you getting in there, even though the mechanism is pretty simple.The problem is, a cable can get stuck in there pretty easily, and jam the mechanism a little. This is not great if you're playing a show and are setting up in a hurry. I kept noticing I only got up to 90% when I pushed the toe down, and found out a few minutes later that my 3 foot cable was stuck under there."
3,Tone sucker!!!,This sucks tone a lot...!!! Go with a morley pvo best! I wont recommend this pedal as it sucks tone
3,It's just okay.,"Here's the bottom line...1: It loads your tone so it sounds kind of dull with a constipated output.2: It's smaller so it has a smaller range... takes some getting used to.3: It has a switch to go from a long sweep to a more abrupt swell. This is a cool feature, but overall, it's really not a ""pro-level"" volume pedal."
4,Good deal...,"... I just hope it lasts! The string construction looks okay, but i cannot imagine having to ever replace it. Light weight, but a little larger than the description width-wise."
4,Tug toys for a firm biter.,"I got this tug to use with my GSD/Mal cross - he loves tug toys. He is still young and is having a hard time compressing this toy to get a full bite on it - he would rather redirect onto the handle. I am going to put this toy away for a while and start using a bite pillow, and we'll come back to this toy once his grip has improved, I expect it will become a favorite. I would say this is for animals with a decent grip already."
3,"Fetch, but not Tug!","The stretchy loop on this toy was gone in less than 3 minutes. Our puppy can tug pretty hard and this did not endure being pulled at all. This toy does stand up to chewing, even though it's listed as ""not a chew toy"". Our puppy likes to play fetch with it, and the firehose material is almost indestructible."
