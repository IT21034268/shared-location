4,Gain a new perspecive of your vocabulary,"Jeff Foxworthy's, Redneck Dicitonary, is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It was so entertaining that I read the whole thing in one sitting-that's just how good it was. Unlike what most people would call a ""normal"" book intended for adults, Foxworthy's has hilarious illustrations on almost every page and not a lot of verbiage per page. Also unlike the normal ""dictionary"" it does not include every word-just the funny ones. An example of his humor is shown in an excerpt, ""Cap-i-tal, n. and v. regarding an action concerning the future of any covering used to close off a receptacle. ""Careful with that bottle-if you don't put on that capital spill."" -pg 20. Get it? Jeff Foxworthy brings up an entirely new perspective of our English language that many of us never thought about. So gain a new perspective and read this book!"
3,Typical red-neck jokes.,"I ordered Jeff Foxworthy's Redneck Dictionary because I was looking for southern expressions to us in something I was working on. But it was not really what I needed. I do like Jeff Foxworthy, but his jokes are all starting to sound the same. I really could not use the information in the book."
3,It's too uncontrovertial for Lina Wertmuller,"Overall it's not a bad movie, but definitely falls short from Lina W.'s other masterpieces, such as Seven Beauties. I've found this film interesting at the beginning, but it looses that special Lina's steam toward the end. And the message of this film is rather unclear - it's not a comedy and it's not a piercing tragedy as in Seven Beauties. I would recommend it for those who like to get more familiar with Italian cinema and with Lina W.'s works."
3,VHS is better than DVD widescreen,"I've heard a lot of talk about how great DVD widescreen is, particularly 2.35 or 2.40. The problem with these ratios is that the top and bottom is cut from the movie. This was the complaint about 4.3 ratio because it cut from the sides, which is true. But if you will notice, 4.3 cuts the side because it has to, in order to get the center portion of the film on screen, this is ""pan and scan"". But 2.40 cuts the tops and bottoms even though there is no need. The black bars could be utilized at the top and bottom on a 2.35 or 2.4 screen.If you don't believe the top and bottom cuts can be severe, check out the VHS full screen versions and the 2.4 widescreen DVD versions of Alien, Godfather, Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, etc.In my opinion, the fullscreen versions of all these films are better than the 2.4 widescreen. Generally, the center of the screen is where most of the story takes place and that should not be cut."
4,"good, but get them cheaper elsewhere","Same ""truffles"" that Trader Joe's and Whole Foods sell for $3-$6."
2,Betty Crocker frosting in a fancy package,"They charged me $10.00 for shipping and handling. I figured, okay, it is in a temperature secure package and they rush it because it is perishable, but no, it came in a regular box, and it was sent out before a holiday weekend, so it spent extra time floating around. Once it arrived it was not 'individualy wrapped', but two large bags in one box. The main ingredient if vegetable shortening and the flavor and texture is about the same as frosting off the baking shelves at my grocery store. Waste of time and money, but if you aren't picky the flavor is okay."
1,Better off with a dollar chocolate bar,"The main ingredient in chocolate is not shortening,but it is in these.They have a vary poor chocolate flavor, and an even worse texture(tastes like eating grease). if you want real chocolate truffles look to other makers."
4,Get Fat and Die Happy...,"Indulge! Great chocolate at a great price. Got these as a birthday gift and they are truly memorable. Put these on your ""Bucket List"""
3,Somebody made a booboo,"When the truffles came I opened them right away. They came quite fast. They were in 2 packages inside the box. They were partially melted, especially on the top. Some were all running together. I quickly put the package in the fridge. The next day when I opened it again, they had stayed in the melted condition, but pieces could be cut from them to eat. I am glad I ordered them for myself and not as a gift. I would have been very embarassed. Obviously someone had left the package sit in a hot spot for too long of a time. Perhaps there should be a warning on the outside of the package about this danger. Nancy L. Bowie"
1,Ridiculous shipping charges!,"These chocolates may be fabulous -- I hope so, as I sent them as a gift. I thought that the shipping charges on my order looked high, but I was in a hurry so I ordered a bunch of gifts, including this one, without examining too closely. Anyway, the shipping charge for this product alone was over $11!! The same price as the product itself. I am giving 1 star because I think this is TACKY to make the product cost double what you think it will by tacking on a such a ridiculous ""shipping and handling"" charge. Beware!"
3,"Delivery cancelled, no comments","I ordered a box of chocolate from the seller, and asked them to ship to Canada. I am not sure why the seller finally canceled the order after 2 weeks. If it is due to some restrictions from Law, I think it is understandable. But it would be better if the seller could cancel the order earlier if they find it out it is impossible to deliver that food to Canada."
2,Melted,"My order came as 1 large blob. The wrappers were mix into a 2.2 pound chocolate turd. It looked like they had been melted and become solid several times. If it didn't go through this remelting process, I assume it would taste better."
4,Truffles,"I will tell you what, I have had good truffles in Europe. These come very close. And for the price they are nothing short of miraculous. Very tastey!"
1,"AWFULL, DIGUSTING TASTE!","Ate one Truffette and it tasted terrible, ate a second to make sure that the first wasn't a fluke, and the second tasted even worse. They have the sickening taste of moldy bitter sweet chocolate used in making chocolate fudge. They are not sweet nor tasty in any sense of the word. They leave a bad taste in my mouth and an unpleasant feeling in my stomache. I will never again pay any attention to the reviews on Amazon. How anyone could report that this awfull concoction is good or great is far beyond me. I may have received a bad lot, but I doubt it. Obviously, a number of reviewers of this product who rated it four or five stars would rate cow dung as delicious. Buy a fifty cent candy bar at your local food store instead of purchasing this awful concoction, at least they taste sweet and don't leave you rushing to the frig for something to kill the taste of Chocmod Truffettes."
5,Heavenly Truffles,Devinely Heaven is the only way to describe these Truffles. If youv'e never had them your in for a special treat. I will be purchasing them again for special occassions!
5,Awesome Value,"Great for the money, just make sure you give them away, 3 truffles = 80% DV saturated fat, wow."
3,Nice with coffee,"These chocolate truffles were on a wonderful sale, and I love chocolate and could not resist. There was a bountiful number of dark chocolate 'kisses' coated with cocoa, and though I ordered them in October, I still have plenty left, and that's after sharing a pretty good sized baggie with a friend.However, I only give it 3 stars because it's not by any means the best chocolate. I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price for them. However, at the bargain price I paid, they are just fine, and very nice to let melt in the mouth while sipping good coffee."
1,the worst truffles,"I love real truffles made of real chocolate,i bought 2 packs of these truffles in Costco, i was so dissapointed when i tried them, you wont enjoy it at all,its like eating butter,its awful, i love real french truffles,Cemoi truffles are the best you can find in usa!dont waste your money,you will throw them away!"
5,Worth every penny,These things are awesome. If you are a chocolate addict you should stay away from these. You won't be able to put them down and you will die of a chocolate overdose.
2,Waste of money,"After reading good reviews, I ordered the truffles during the holiday season. I am a chocolate lover and I was highly disappointed with the truffles. The taste as well as texture was not up to the mark. You'll be better off spending your money else where."
1,Better at TJ's...,"I am sorry to say I recv'd a box of these as a Christmas gift. They were simply awful and I tossd away. However, what saved the day was that my husband and I buy at ""TJ's"" Trader Joe and you can buy a truffle similar to this-- box looks kinda the same BUT ITS NOT!! texture taste and shelf life (they get eaten quick) are wonderful!! packaged as a lot (not individually)in a cellophane bag then the cardboard packaging-is fine. We serve them now at all our dinner parties and just for nibbles.. Go to TJ's."
4,Same brand ONE QUARTER the price,"I can understand paying for the convenience of not having to leave my sofa when I want delicious truffles. But you can buy exactly this brand at Trader Joe's for $5. One quarter of the price! That's a bit much. You can also get one's that are very similar, but not the same exact brand, at Whole Food's for.... $6.50.All of that said. I love these truffles, not so much for eating straight, but for cooking with. Add them to brownies or your chocolate cake recipe for a killer death by chocolate experience. If it's brownies you're making, add some good quality macadamia nuts, halved, and there's nothing better.However, I will be getting these at Trader Joe's. I can drive 20 minutes and stock up.Warning: store these in a COOL PLACE. A box once got put on top of the fridge and there was a solid block of truffle in the morning."
3,Not sweet in the least,"Maybe I'm different -- I expect candy to be sweet. These truffles were not sweet at all, weren't light like a chocolate ganache, and were dusted with cocoa that came off all over me. With all the amazing reviews here, I expected something that was tasty, at least. Instead I got two bitter bags of who-knows-what that I won't eat straight and can't use in anything else. Gee, thanks"
3,truffle review,These candies were not as small as I have previously bought...but not from this vendor. I will use as gifts but will not order again. Vendor service was excellent.
5,Fabulous Taste Treat !,"These truffles are simply the best tasting and by far, the least costly I have tried. They make wonderful gifts for clients and friends.Service is outstanding in order being processed/confirmed within 24 hrs.Be prepared however to wait approx. 2 weeks from shipment date before arrival. I'm a repeat customer and the 2 week timeframe has been consistent, so plan ahead for gift-giving.Well worth the wait!"
1,Not worth the money,"These same chocolates can be purchased at a wholesale store for less then half of the price, before you add in the crazy shipping charge. I found that out after I had placed my order here, unfortunately. And when they did arrive, they were completely melted, because the delivery person left them out on the porch. As far as flavor goes, most people that tried them thought they were bitter."
4,Sweets for Sweetys,"This a great product, by itself or try dropping one into your coffee for that extra special quiet moment at the start or end of the day!!"
1,Don't Bother - Vegetable Oil is the main ingredient and it tastes like it,"You get what you pay for. These are not very good at all. If you've had good truffles, you will find these very disappointing. Costco was selling these two pound packages for $10 or was it two for $10 ? I don't recall but I got two. I took the one I hadn't opened and returned it and through the mostly uneaten package away. I should have checked the ingredients first. Good chocolates or any candy for that matter will never have vegetable oil as the main ingredient."
1,Moldy Truffles,Last night I spoke with Jane Newman and she told me that the truffles I sent as a Christmas gift were moldy. How awful! I didn't ask her whether or not she contacted the company. I apologized profusely and was terribly embarrassed. I won't be ordering anything from that company again.
1,Melted in transit,Melted in transit. Need I say more.... and its been very cold here.... 20-40 degrees.
1,TACKY -- the Shipping Charge is $11,"If you are willing to pay $22 for the box, then buy it. I've had them before and they do taste good, but not $22 good."
5,Scrumptious.,"Buy them. But you have to promise yourself to put one of the bags in the freezer, or you might eat them all at once, damn the consequences!"
1,"Arrived damaged, can not give as a gift","The truffle package arrived with two severely damaged corners (bottom), and some of the contents are crumbled. I intended to give this as part of a holiday gift, but now can not. The order information says that this item can not be returned because it is a grocery. It would be great if the seller would contact me to facilitate a return, refund or exchange."
2,"NOT chocolate, folks","The people saying, ""these are the best chocolate truffles I've ever tasted"" have obviously never tasted a real chocolate truffle. These things, while they'll satisfy a sweet tooth, are NOT chocolate. Search the box; you won't see the word ""chocolate"" anywhere. They are made of vegetable oil flavored with some cocoa. Try a Teuscher's Champagne Truffle, and then tell me if these vegetable oil balls are still ""the best truffle"". Not even close. Not even in the same universe as a real truffle."
5,bought it as a gift for the women I work with,who then renamed this candy 'chocolate crack' lol it is an excellent candy but was to rich tasting for some
3,looks good,"I bought these thinking they were something special but they are OK. It's made of cocoa powder, etc. but after a while, they were OK. I would not recommend buying more than one box if you are just trying it out for the first time. There are two smaller bags in the box."
2,The problem of seller,The chocolate is delicious. But this seller sent melt chocolate to me! They are melt! I guess it expires. I didn't find the expiration date on the box.
1,Literally made me sick,"We were given these as a gift, and as a chocoholic I ate a few and thought they were good. However, I woke up a few hours later with an upset stomach and threw up. I now realize that they are just too rich and the cocoa powder makes them very acidic or bitter, so I can never eat more than one or two now. No other chocolate or food has done that to me before."
1,never been so sick,I tried these a few years ago... they tasted great.... and then i got extremely sick... i don't know what it was.. i hear it has a lot of hydrogenated oil. I eat extremely healthy. I never eat oily foods. may be that's it. who knows.
5,Packed with Healthy Info!,"This is one of my favorite books on health information. Its very knowledgable, well-organized, and easy to read and follow. I've already dappled with a raw food diet, so I'm familiar with detoxing, I already buy organic and will be soon starting this detox plan with Michelle's recommendations. I'll update this review to let people know how it went, but I'm very positive. I don't suffer from any serious illnesses or dieseases, I just want to improve my health, get more energy, etc."
4,no way back,"This plan really worked for me. Aside from the fact that it turned out to be expensive, time consuming and requires a lot of will power - hey, but what wouldn't you do to regain your health? I followed the detox plan with my friend and we split the cost of everything including this book. But now we are healthier and happier and there is no way we are going to our old ways after going through this."
2,Not a good fit!,"Unfortunately, the fit was all wrong for me. The quality is good, but it was uncomfortable to wear."
5,Graphic Description of Indian Wars,"I read Wellman's two excellent histories, 'Death on the Prairies' and 'Death in the Desert' years ago but these gripping books have remained on my mind ever since. 'Death in the Desert' is primarily about the Apache Wars of the southwest. A relative handful of warriors from different Apache tribes keep a far more numerous U.S. Military guessing for many years. There are graphic descriptions of the savageries the Apache visited on their enemies...this book is not for the sqeamish.At the same time, it's fascinating to consider a now long-gone warrior culture that gave and expected no quarter. Of course the Americans aren't innocent, either. Those Apache's who do bend a knee and surrender to the U.S. reservation system are degraded and many die.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico."
5,Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Tail Comb,"I live in the country. So I dye my hair myself, and I do that often since I'm 54 years old and have plenty of white hair. Let's say I'm skilled on doing that. I've been looking for a tail comb that would precisely part my hair into sections. Usually the tail bends and you can't do a good job, so you do it twice, trice... This comb has a sturdy tail with a precise end that doesn't bend. And that's what I wanted. The teeth aren't smooth as they said, but it's ok. I guess it reduces static too. I highly recomend plus the burgundy color is very pretty."
2,"Decent potential, some plotting issues","I generally enjoy Hamilton's work, having read everything he has in print, but this book seems weak. My comments contain spoilers.The Julia thread could have been heavily compressed. It seemed a combination of comic relief (the comments about her clothing by a tv personality), a venue for discussing future-earth's technology, and something to fill the book up. I ended up skipping almost all of her pages, just reading where something important to the plot actually happened. Her romance-life issues and banter with her grandfather were page-skippers.Hamilton seems weak on ending stories, and the way the antagonist is flushed out on a murder spree at the end seemed a bit odd. Aside from vengeance, what else would be gained by killing mandel?I did like this book much more than the bizarre Nano Flower that followed, but not nearly as much as mindstar rising."
2,"NOT ""OUR"" HAMILTON","BORING, CONFUSING, I'M AMAZED PETER F. HAMILOTON COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS LITTLE ESSAY IN BANALITY...ABSOLUTELY BORING, I HAD TO DROP IT AFTER ONE THIRD.."
3,I prefer Curious,"This is a nice scent. It is a more musky scent than the original ""Curious"". If you like the smell of Musk then you will want to wear this perfume."
3,Atomizer stops working Scent doesn't last,"This scent is kind of sweet without being overpowering. My favorite perfume is Pink Sugar by Aqoulina and before I bought that I bought this. This reminds me of that but isn't as aggressive. This isn't as sweet. The problem I have with it is, it does not last. I will have to spray myself over and over and over. Also the atomizer stops working. I've had mine for about 2+yrs and it recently stopped working. I've had it so long because I didn't wear it a lot due to the lack of power in the scent."
3,"OK Biscuits, slow shipping, plastic bag","Biscuits look typical of composition biscuits. Ordered 6/25 received 7/2, so shipping is slower than ideal. Items are bulk packaged in non-resealable, light weight plastic baggies, so you will need an old mayo jar or coffee can to store."
4,An absolute must for any blues enthusiast...,Absolutely amazing to find this...I had a bootleg for the longest time. This is the CD you should hand someone who asks you what the blues is. Gritty and historical.
5,this is one of there greatest albums in years!,I went to their concert two years ago in S.F and it was a blast. they performed like no other. This is a got to get album for all Erasure fans ouy there...
3,Intriguing Idea,"Nephilim is one of the better of the Christian-Fiction genre. I found it more engaging than the Left Behind series but not as good as The Oath by Frank Peretti. The premise is similar to other ancient-astronaut spin-offs but a few nice surprises along the way equal an overall good rating. I hope a sequel is in the making. For a serious look at the same subject I highly recommend Tom Horn's book, The Gods Who Walk Among Us, also available from Amazon.com"
5,Unique and exciting,"What a great cross between science fiction and Christian fiction! I am hard to please in both genres, but Nephilim delivers good ""aliens among us"" suspense combined with a demonic plot to destroy Christianity. The main character ""Mac"" is a middle aged reporter who has lost his faith for the past two years following the death of his son and the breakup of his marriage. He has fled to the bottle for his comfort, and is on the brink of losing his damaged career entirely. Mac gets a chance for the story of his career, involving secret government installations and mysterious claims of alien abduction. He travels to Israel to see the remains of an almost-human giant referred to in the Bible as ""Nephilim."" His lukewarm interest turns into commitment to saving the world. The characterization is excellent. The plot is far-fetched, but hey--this is science fiction. So...get this book and sit back in your easy chair for an enjoyable mini-vacation!"
3,Decent,This was a decent book. So it has some cheezy dialogue? Big deal. The point of this book is to convey how stong man can be without picking up a weapon. You're always armed. You're armed with your mind. That's good enough.
5,Written to challenge your view,"In reading this book, not only does it take you on a journey of a man (Mac's) personal inner battle,it also takes you on a journey for the reader to make a decision on how they feel about this hot topic Aliens vs God, and what really is the truth about aliens. L.A. Marzulli does a great job in weaving you through this thought provoking subject."
5,"Powerful, moving, provocative","I found this book by L.A. Marzulli to be a thrilling novel, a real page turner. It certainly approaches the subject of UFO's in a thoughtful and provocative way. I'd highly encourage anyone interested in UFO's to give it a read...unless, of course, they have some sort of bigoted, anti-Christian perspective as the previous reviewer seems to have."
4,"Not a bad yarn, easy to read - christian fiction","I was a bit annoyed when I started reading this book because I feel I was conned into buying christian fiction that was just a front to present religious views about aliens and end times. Nevertheless, these views were presented within the context of the plot and, to be fair, alternate points of view were given an airing too.A good story, well written and a bit scary too. I did enjoy it and have ordered the sequel."
1,This was published???,"Just because a novel is written by a Chrisitan author does not mean that it has to be dry, bland, cheezy, lame, and far-fetched. Yet, that is exactly what this ridiculous novel is. At the core of the book is an alcoholic journalist stumbling around in a drunken stupor all because he lost his son in a car accident (There's originality for you!) Sadly, things only become more ridiculous as the goverment decides to fill him in on their Alien Agenda. There isn't any action, no real drama, and the one-dimensional characters are as bad as the boring, preachy dialogue that is but one of the many flaws in this ""sugar coated"" demon fest..."
5,A+++ EXCELLENT!!!,"eventhough im a little more than 3/4 of the way through the book, so far i think its a excellent book and once u start to read it, i promise you that you wont be able to put the book down. I highly recomend this book to people who have a intrest in aliens and ufo's. A++++"
1,And the point of it all is?,"The plot had some promise, but there came a point near the end of the book where it became clear to this reader that ""the point"" of the book was MIA. Overall, it was a disappointment. Why the publisher had the audiacity to post a ""We Guarantee You'll Love This Book"" sticker on the outside is beyond me. Had they ever read it?"
2,A literal deus ex machina,"It seems today that many authors begin a book with energy and continue eloquently until it's time to wrap up the book. Nephilim began with a wonderful concept but in the end became too fantastic and shallow, as if there were a deadline for the author. I was prepared for a great battle between the forces of good and evil, but it simply didn't happen; God appeared and wrapped up the book. I'm not a prophet, but can we say sequel ""Great Deception""? Not quite as trite as Heaven's War, more interesting than a dictionary, but it's a book I'll only read once."
1,One Of The Worst Books....EVER!,"Nothing intrigues me more than mysteries and hidden messages of the Bible. This is exactly why I chose to read Nephilim; I was expecting a religious thriller with some bizarre twists and turns. To make a long story short, I was very disappointed. Not only is the plot far fetched (since when are alcholic journalists recruited by the government to partake in dangerous, top secret missions involving aliens?), but one begins to question the author's Christianity, as well. Why? The whole plot of the book is that the ""Nephilim"" are the result of fallen angels breeding with human females. What could have been a very promising novel is ruined with plain, dry, completely unmoving dialogue, boring characters, and flat, lifeless writing. This book was indeed a waste of time. I highly suggest skipping this waste of paper and ink and reading something more believable."
2,A platform for proselytizing that left me unmoved,"I might have given this book 3 stars if I hadn't felt so strongly that the author's intent was primarily to convert the reader to Christianity. In my opinion, he should have devoted less time and energy toward that effort and more on actually developing his characters.As one who has diligently studied the origins of Christianity, as well as the other patriarchal religions, and has deliberately chosen not to follow that path, I feel the author is insulting my intelligence by including me among those to whom his god sends a strong delusion so that I might believe a lie. I might point out that it hardly requires ""strong delusion"" to disbelieve the improbable - a healthy dose of rational thought will suffice."
1,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE IN THE UFO COMMUNI,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A COLLECTION OF MINOR ANECDOTAL ITEMS FROM THE UFO FIELD SURROUNDED BY FUNDAMENTAL RELIGIOUS ADJECTIVES; FOR EXAMPLE, DESCRIBING THE ALIENS AS ""DEMONIC"". I EXPECT A GRADE B FILM SCRIPT TO FOLLOW."
1,Don't buy this book,"Buy this book if you are really unintelligent and knows virtually nothing about biology. Really. if you are the person who wants to learn, find an alternative book."
5,right part,"I had been looking for a replacement lens, came across this one- it is the exact lens that comes in the Ryobi one+ light, the ""original"" blue flashlight."
4,"But for one major shortcoming, a valuable read!","This book is about success, management, and the hitech business. It seeks to identify a number of 'success factors' through interviewing and analysing the strategies and methodologies of a selection of hitech companies. As such, it seems well researched and argued, and resembles the approach of the now classic 'In search of excellence'(ISOE). However, its weakness is to ignore one of its own conclusions, and not include 'professional management' as a success factor, i.e. the equivalent of perhaps ISOE's 'Hands on Value driven' success factor! Therefore, Silicon Gold Rush ultimately itemises an organisational wish list without incorporating the one factor capable of delivering business success: professional management! Despite the above weakness, the book is nevertheless an interesting read. Callum Morrison"
2,Nice...but a little disappointed,"I love the design this wine rack. There are four ""holders"" for the wine. When I hung it up, I started to fill it and because the wire holders were not spaced far enough apart, it would only hold two bottles. I had to have a friend work with the holders and bend them to allow for the other two bottles to be held in the holders. They weren't spaced far enough apart. The wine rack is beautiful, and goes along with my kitchen well, but the actual design and placement of the holders was not designed well."
2,Looks great ONLY,"I was looking for a wine bottle holder for the wall that was eye catching and came across this. It is very stylish and will get compliments....... SO, If you are looking for something that looks good then go ahead and purchase this. However, if you want to actually put wine bottles in it, then keep looking. Just as the picture shows, only 2 bottles will fit. The bottle slots are made too close to one another to get 4 bottles in. (This is probably why the picture only shows 2 bottles) I tried to play with it but it is already not too sturdy, so I couldn't get anymore to fit in without breaking it.Also, only one hole is provided to put a screw in (at top). I recommend using a molly and a screw (purchased seperately) if you dont have a stud in the wall, especially if you want to hold the weight.:-("
2,Not impressed,"I ordered this item for my mother and received a broken wine rack and no invoice for my order. While its a pretty wine rack its not really functional, i would not order from this company again"
4,Nice design,"the rack looks nice, however hanging was a bit difficult and it must be hung in a stud. A heavy screw for hanging is needed"
2,Poorly made!,Love the idea of this item and how it looks although it is not at all functional. The bottles do not fit in the rack which is why the item is pictured with only two bottles in it. That is all you can fit. At the risk of breaking off the bottle holders you can try to bend them to make them work better but even if they don't break off the rack they still may not look right. If I had it to do over again I would NEVER buy this wine rack! Very disappointed! Shame on the amazon seller for selling such a poor quality item!
1,"No bullfighters, please","No one with any sense of humanity should buy this doll. Mattel stopped production after protests from animal lovers around the world. Why should Barbie be portrayed as a cold-blooded killer of bulls? Bullfighting is an anathema to civilization, a remnant of medieval cruelty to animals, and to glorify it in any way, such as making a bullfighting doll, is something that should not be encouraged. Buy something else."
3,Wrong costume,"The costume is nice, but more fitting for a Ken doll. Barbie would look more feminine dressed like a Flamingo dancer. Nice outfit for Ken, but not fitting for an Italien Senorita."
2,designed for Asian people; made in China (of course),"Avoid. Absolute garbage; barely covers suit jacket from shoulder to shoulder and compresses and wrinkles the sleeves. When is plastic breathable? ""Breathable fabric accents keep clothes smelling fresh"" Amazon you should be ashamed for selling crap.This works:Shoulder Covers - Closet Storage set of 12by Better Home Plastics Corp"
1,Too small!,"Very narrow covers, not gusseted. More suitable for small hangars or children's clothes. On standard hangars, these barely cover the garment and end up squinching the sleeves, which can cause creases. Otherwise, the quality is fine."
2,Smaller Than They Appear,"Although the photo accompanying these covers shows them over what appears to be mens jackets, they are really a more appropriate size for shirts/blouses. I orderedShoulder Covers - Closet Storage set of 12at the same time. They are larger, more suited to use with mens jackets, and are actually less expensive than these covers. If you just want to cover shirts, these are fine; however, if you intend to use them over jackets and/or anything on curved wooden hangers, I highly recommend going with the alternative."
3,Solid Shoulder Covers,These should covers are pretty good overall. They cover a large part of any suit top and are made of pretty thick and sturdy plastic. I'd bought others before that were thin and would wrinkle easily. The only downside to these is the opening for the hanger. It's a bit awkward to get the hanger into the small slit. Otherwise worth the price and protection for my clothes!
4,Excellent album of the 1999 hottest club hits !,"It's an excellent album if your looking for the 1999 club hits. You'll find the best of atb, bob marley vs funkstar deluxe (sun is shining) and many more... It also include most of the hits from Europe popular in the US. It's a nice album if you want to have the best of the best of the year 1999 + you don't have to buy a bunch of CD's..."
1,Would give zero stars if I could!!,"We have a 70lb lab mix and were desperately looking for something that he couldnt destroy within minutes. We thought, given the size of this bone and the fact that it is advertised as a real cow bone that he would have a more difficult time. We quickly found that this bone had a soft spot which allowed him to get several larger pieces off of it. Within 5 minutes it was unusable as we found that both knuckle ends had the same kind of soft spot which allowed him to gnaw deeply into the bone. After ingesting a few pieces he had loose stools for the next 24 hours. The smell of the bone is also very repulsive. We definitely DO NOT recommend this bone under any circumstances."
5,Great Product!,I bought this bone as a Christmas present for my American Bulldog. He loved it! It kept him entertained for hours and was big enough to hold up for over a week!
2,Could have been better,"I think they could have done a better job of picking ""Best Of"" songs. As much as this costs, do yourself a favor, spend a little more and just buy ""Rum Sodomy & the Lash"", and ""If I Should Fall From Grace with God"". I think you'll be much happier, especially if you are new to the Pogues."
3,Pogues CD used,It was billed as 'excellent condition'. One song has a scratch that makes it unplayable. Other than that the condition was good. The scratch should have been divulged by the seller and Amazon.
3,They left out half the powerhouses,"I agree with andrewemiller. This is not ""The Best"", this is ""Some of the Best"". You wonder who picked the songs, because many really good ones are missing. In addition to ""Rum, Sodomy & The Lash"" and ""If I Should Fall From Grace With God"", I also recommend ""Waiting for Herb"" and ""Red Roses For Me""."
2,Weak Compilation,"Some pretty poor choices on here. Mostly fast-paced festive songs and some slow cheesy ballads. ""Summer in Siam"" is probably the worst song from Hell's Ditch, and they included it here. They could have chose better songs from their CDs. Better to buy one of their complete CDs like Rum, Sodomy..., Hell's Ditch, or Fall From Grace."
5,So many reviews but here is one more!,"If you are in any doubt about the Pogues, buy this record. Quite simply, it is fantastic! The songs are all first rate, and it reminds us all that Shane was (is? who knows) a first rate songwriter! Once you are addicted to this record, you'll want to go buy 'em all! GO FOR IT!"
4,Could be better,"There is not much choice of English - Arabic dictionaries. This one is good, and unlike many the Arabic text is very clear and legible. However, it does tend to omit the plurals in Arabic. e.g. it does not show the Arabic plural of the English word ""door."" Nor does it give the Arabic root of the word. Given the high price of this dictionary, these shortcomings are irritating. It would be good if the publisher would provide rather more value for money in the next edition."
2,Awkward,"This dictionary does not come close to Oxford's Spanish-English English-Spanish dictionary. There are so many strange/obscure/archaic(?) usages that no English speaker uses, unless they still do in Great Britain. For the life of me I can't remember the last time i was ""plied"" with questions or ""revolved"" a problem in my mind, rather than mull it over. The smaller one doesn't have as many specialized terms, but I'd pick it over this one in a trice. That apparently means ""in the blink of an eye"" and I had to read the Arabic to get what that means. This edition also hasn't been updated since 1972 and still costs a bundle."
1,ATTENTION SELF STUDY! No English pronunciation!!!,"I have used an English/Japanese dictionary that had the Japanese pronuciation in English characters as well as in Japanese. This book contains no such function. If you don't read Arabic, this book is of very limited use. You will have no way of determining the pronunciation. THIS BOOK DOES NOT SUPPORT SELF STUDY! Such an obvious oversight by the Editors and Publishers of this book is deeply disappointing."
1,A History of Europe,"Garbage. My take: the rants/musings, contorted pontifications, caricatures of a semi-senile, second-rate academic, drunk with popular pseudo-aclaim. Stylistically, it's a syntactic cesspool. To see these characteristics, one, I believe, need only read the first forty-five pages."
2,Not worth it,"We bought this product because we were so happy with ""Elmo's reading basics"" and figured we couldn't go wrong and were intrigued by the Spanish component. Wrong...this is an older style program compared to Reading Basics and just doesn't teach as effectively. Seems to run okay on our Windows 98."
4,Not bad,"I saw this movie when I was just a mere lad,and apparently,I also saw RETURN to Macon County,because I was confused as to why the yellow Chevy wasn't in it, but I knew Jethro was! So now I'll have to buy the other one also! But it's worth it,and now that I'm grown up,I can understand the plot. Back in the day, I just watched it because of the cars...Sort of like now!"
2,Frustrated,"I honestly couldn't say whether I had seen this movie before. My uncle owned a drive-in when I was growing up so I guess I could have but watching the movie now did not jar my memory. I bought it as a gift for my husband as he is nostalgic for the ""good ole days"". While he did enjoy the time period & setting of the movie, we were disappointed because the language was vulgar & unneccesary. Some of the sexual content was distasteful. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. It was also a little weird. One of those flicks that leaves you trying to figure out what really happened & why. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money. Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
4,not bad!,"this was the cheapest & was happy it was avail. & the seller let me know about things before I made final payment. shipping, price & movie was all great!"
1,Macon County Line,When I received the DVD I could hear the DVD moving around within the case. I am worried that the DVD is scratched or damaged in some way. The DVD was a gift for my father. He opened it a few days ago. I am waiting to hear from him if the DVD was scratched or damaged in any way. All of my other DVD's that I received appeared to be in good shape.
2,Not very useful,"Most of the ideas in this book are simply a rehash of information readily found in other books, and often common sense. For example, do not get hooked on soap operas to save time. Also, I felt that the same basic idea was presented more than once in slightly different formats. In other words, I do not believe that the book really gives you 611 separate and distinct ideas."
1,"or ""How to Avoid Your Feelings of Paternal Abandonment""","A book for chumps who can't find the internal authority of their own. Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being a sensitive person but, one needs to seek permission to be so from within one's self rather than looking to ""daddy"", boss, or guru to make it O.K. You'd do better to grow the backbone to trust your essential nature. Be your own guru. And as for Da? Good for him! He figured out how to capitalize on a deep psychological need of many and, he got his own island out of it! Way to go Da! (or whatever you call yourself now.)"
4,Nice quality knives,"Just received these knives and was very pleased at the quality. They are sharp, very attractive anfd feel good in hand. I almost bought them in a grocery store at about 2X the price."
3,"Not a bad knife set for cheap, but has a rust problem","I originally purchased these knives because of their low price and relatively respectable product name. However, I found that after only a few uses, they developed rust spots. I hand-wash these knives and let them dry in a rack with the rest of my silverware, which I've never had a rust problem with.The knives are sharp, and decently weighted, but make sure you dry them off after you're finished washing them if you want to preserve them."
4,Quite Good Bargain,Sharp - Heavily weighted grips - Ergonomic even for large hands - Not an unattractive style - Particularly good value for Amazon Prime members.
5,Really terrific,"Plowing ahead with the series, I found 'G' to be engrossing and chilling. I enjoyed the double plots and also very much liked how Grafton brought in many of the characters from past novels and fleshed them out a little. Bringing back Dietz was a stroke of genius as it allows Kinsey to play off of a male version of herself. I see from other reviews that he will be in future books - can't wait. Overall the plot and suspense of the story were one of the best...it's definitely a don't-miss in the Kinsey series."
4,G,"One of her good books, not great. Ending left you hanging a bit. Otherwise the storyline was fairly interesting and read nicely."
3,G is also for great,"I believe the sixth book in the series is the eighth I've read. I have nine more unread on my shelf. This is slightly weaker than its predecessors. If, as I suspect, this is as weak as her writing gets, I'm mighty impressed. It's a fine book, covering some ground I've tried and failed to write about myself, within the confines of a workable mystery and the quirky wit we know Grafton for. I'm jealous, okay?"
4,Another great mystery from Grafton.,"I find myself writing the same things over and over about the books in this series, but Grafton is so consistently top-notch that it's hard to think of new superlatives. Kinsey is a great character--complex, tough, practical, nosy--and Grafton stays true to that character in all her books.Kinsey's not just solving a mystery in this one, she's also trying to outwit the hit man on her tail. To this end, she teams up with another P.I. to act as her bodyguard. This innovative twist adds just the right amount of suspense to this book, and the ending--to both the mystery and the hit man scenario--is definitely a kicker.Whether this is your first Kinsey Millhone book or you're a fan of the entire series (there's a nice emotional payoff for Kinsey fans in this one, as Kinsey finally meets a man worthy of her), this one is a must-read. Enjoy!"
4,The Little Old Lady's Gumshoe,"Kinsey must find a little old lady. She finds herself in trouble and hires a bodyguard for herself. Grafton keeps your interest every step of the way through this plot. Put yourself with Kinsey as she works of solve this crime. Sit down in you favorite chair and settle in for a fun read with Kinsey. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream """
5,A Solid Addition to the Series,"Three things happen in this book and are listed on the first page of the book. It is Kinsey's birthday, she is hired by Mrs. Clyde Gersh to find her mother in the Mojave desert, and she is in one of the top slots of Tyrone Patty's hit list. Sue Grafton weaves the story lines together in her usually entertaining fashion, with a proper dose of suspense. And, finally there is a man in her life, though not by choice. He is a private detective whose job is to protect Kinsey from Patty's hit men. A very entertaining read..."
4,"""G"" is for Good, not quite Great.","This book was very much worth reading and I enjoyed it. I just can't quite give it 5 stars. I cannot put my finger on anything major, just a few minor things here and there that made it not quite as good as the previous ones in the series. One complaint I have is that the character of Dietz wimped out at the end. The problem of two diverse story lines was a bit distracting at times, but that was tied together pretty well. However, there was a major glitch, in my opinion, with the explanation of how the hit man was always able to find Kinsey. I don't want to give that away, but I will say that it was not very believable. This is not so much a stumbling point in the series as a leveling off. I still eagerly look forward to reading the rest of this series."
3,Fast-paced but confusing!,"Let me say that the beginng and middle of this book were great. They were action-packed and fast-paced. Kinsey was as funny as ever especially around Robert, the male version of herself. Then the last sixty pages were confusing. The ending of the hitman story was still easy to follow but the ending to the Gersh storyline was confusing. Not to give anything away but I didn't know who was really who and why things happened the way they happened. I read the ending twice and I still can't make sense of it. Maybe I'm stupid? O well still an engrossing mystery well worth your time."
4,no fog,"these are pretty good in that they do not fog up, heck now that I say that its a big deal. I dont think I've ever had safety glasses that didn't fog. Last week was over 100 degrees and they didn't fog even tho I was dripping with sweat. But after a few weeks of daily use lenses have some scratches and one of the rubber tips pulls off and sticks behind my ear, needs a shot of glue.These things stick to your head pretty positively and wont fall off even in propped up on your head and working.So light often forget I have them on my head, and comfortable too and I have a big head. much better and cheaper than MSA's they sell at Home Despot etc. order a few pair."
5,The Beach Club is THE perfect beach read!!,"I can not begin to say enough how much I loved this book. If I had only one complaint it would be that I decided to read it on a big family vacation...and missed out on some of the fun during the first half of the week because I was way too enthralled and more interested in reading Beach Club than I was in day-drinking on the OCMD boardwalk! Seriously, even with a hot sun beating down and the waves calling my name, I not bring myself to leave my beach chair and this book. The characters are so endearing and well-developed...even when they're not at their most likable, they're still relatable, and you find yourself rooting for all of them to have a happy (or at least fitting) ending. I had read some of Elin Hillderbrand's books before, and since this one, and while I have enjoyed all of them, this was most definitely my favorite. A must read."
5,The Beach Club,This book was excellent. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I just learned about ElinHilderbrand when I saw Silver Girl in the library and checked it out with hope that I would like it. I loved the book and have continued to read her other books. She is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading many more.
4,Summer on Nantucket,"I've discovered Elin Hilderbrand this Summer, and have read ten of her books. I've never been to Nantucket, but feel that I know it well. Great read, each book better than the last."
2,"slow, dry, and predictable",this book was not as enticing as the other books by Elin. I had to force myself to read it at times. Parts of the book were very predictable - the elderly woman's demise and the relationship b/t the main character's girlfriend and his employee. Island is a much better read - much more developed characters and plot. Just purchased Barefoot - hope it compares to Island.
3,Fun mindless read for the beach,"The story revolves around a high class resort (that really exists) and the characters are the guests and the people who work there (who really don't exist). A little like a soap opera. A beautiful yet literary girl, a handsome man with commitment problems, another handsome man who was once Mr. November, a slightly older super-fit woman chasing her biological clock, a dark, brooding type male seeking revenge, a brazilian lover, an aged woman of wisdom, a little Robert Frost, a rebellious teenager and a little mystery thrown together with a big Hurricane. If you have ever visited Nantucket, you'll enjoy all the references to the places you know and love. It will make you want to visit again."
4,The beach club,Another excellent book by Elin Hildebrand. All of her books are well written and the characters feel like people that you know.
2,Too predictable,I didn't care for this Hilderbrand story nearly as much as I have some of her others. I'll keep reading her and hoping for better stories!
2,The Beach Club,I was really disappointed in this book. Elin Hilderbrand is one of my favorite authors and I just thought this book was a little shallow and predictable compared to her other novels.
3,Reading Lite,"After reading two fairly ""heavy"" novels, ""Beach Club"" was just what I need to relax a bit.The location was intriguing--next summer I plan to visit Nantucket and look forward to identifying the places the author mentions. I can do without meeting some of the characters, though. Although those who peopled this book were well described, some of them were less than likeable.I liked the relationship between Mack and Lacey--that was really special. The descriptions of some of the guests was also very much on-target...I live at a beach resort in the summer and some visitors actually do blame the resort if the weather is bad! Imagine that! You sure do see all types in a place like this, not all of them good.This was easy reading, a fast-paced story that read like a TV soap opera. I finished it quickly and did not have to think too much about what I was reading.I do believe the the author's love for her island home showed in her writing about it, and I welcomed that."
1,A cure for insomnia,"I love Nantucket! This book shows nothing of Nantucket's beauty and charm. It is used strictly as a location in which to place self-involved, snobby caricatures. The ""earnest poor boy orphan,"" the ""loud mouthed sports team owner,"" the ""rich white girl in love with a black man."" Wow! This muddled novel of cliched characters, annoying changes in tense and irritating style drove me nuts. If you want a book with no real narrative, no real characters and slovenly style, this one's for you."
3,Fun summer reading - a day at the beach,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Hilderbrand's style of writing. She captures you immediately and makes you laugh and cry throughout the story. The story line is good, but complicated and maybe too many story lines going on at once. However, the ending was a kick and it screams sequel. I loved most of the characters, although she left you hanging with one character, Vance, who seemed incomplete and not well defined, in comparison to her other characters. I definitely recommend this book and look forward to other books by Ms. Hilderbrand. She is a great author."
5,A Novel That Grows On You,Out of all of Ms Hilderbrand's Books This was my favorite so far. Its a story that grows on you as you become attached to the characters. I felt that I somehow knew each of the stories characters in some form or fashion. It started off slow but as the story went on I related to each character and by mid point I just wanted to keep reading and wished the story did not end. I hope some day a sequel will be written.
3,Good but some annoying characters,"This book kept me hooked but there were several times when characters were annoying and a couple of times when I felt I hated all of them!Especially unlikeable to me, were the couple Bill and Therese - it seemed we should sympathize with them because they lost a baby 28 years ago, but that did not justify the control freaks they became, especially Bill. We were supposed to feel bad for him because other people made choices he did not want them to make. I felt bad for their daughter because of their planning her career and her marriage for her and acting like they had a right to do that. Then at other times she was an annoying spoiled brat.I did like Neil and the various guests - that was a realistic touch. Jem and Vance were OK. Mack and Maribel took turns being annoying.But it kept me reading and I did want to know what happened!"
2,Book is a Bust!,"I really enjoyed ""Barefoot"" and ""Summer People"". This book, I did NOT like. The characters were uninteresting and annoying. The were characters that had nothing to do with the story, yet it dragged on and on (Lacey). The story drifted off too many times. There was no purpose. I had to struggle to finish this one."
1,"Shallow, silly and dull",This author doesn't know how to tell a story. The characters are not developed or believable. The story lines are shallow. I thought she might be like Maeve Binchy - nowhere close. The phone book would be more interesting.
1,Really lame,"My sense is that Ms. Simmons is a very genuine person but this book is just lame. She identifies 4 kinds of people adders, subtractors, dividers and multipliers- guess what their characteristics are?If you're a teenager this book might be insightful but if you're an adult working to understand people and relationships, leave this book on the shelf. I assumed that a PhD would write something with significantly greater depth. I was wrong."
4,Recommended Paranormal Reference,"This book is easy to navigate, very informative, and well written. I really enjoy reading this book and; when I travel to an area, I reread the information about the ghosts there. I don't believe Haunted Places is 100% complete, but I still recommend it to anyone interested in the ghosts of the United States."
1,It Stinks!,"This is a stupid book with fantasies about the paranormal myself being an expert in the field. I have read the book once and went to a few of the places he listed as being ""Haunted"" and I took every instrument I had none of them showed any signs of being paranormal it is the worst book I have ever read. -Dr. Dennis Meyers"
5,Where to go to experience strange things first hand,"This book is a state-by-stae guide to haunted sites: cemetaries, neighborhoods, houses, schools, historical sites - you name it, if it was ever reported as experiencing paranormal occurrences, it's listed here.Each site is linked to at least one item in the bibliography (many to more than one) where additional info can be found. (The bibliography has more than 230 items.) Hauck gives detailed information himself on each site and then tells exactly where each can be found. It's a thorough reference tool for anybody interested in this kind of phenonoma.Probably an updated version should be considered soon. This is such a valuable tool it would be sad to see it become outdated or not current."
2,Cheap but disappointing,"Kyoto Symphony Orchestra is a good local emsemble and turned out a few recordings of some core repetoire a couple of years ago under the baton of their then music director Uwe Mund. This recording is one of them; however, the performance is simply mediocre or just barely acceptable. The opening Finlandia is hardly a rousing curtain raiser in their hands. The Four Legends is not bad but ultimately lackluster. It is pretty much the same story for the rest. The recording sounds a bit constricted too with not much air around the instruments.Listen to Karajan in Finlandia (any of his four or five recordings of the piece), and you will find you are in a totally different world. As for the Four Legends, the Ormandy/Philadelphia is the one to go for. I hope that EMI will reissue it as one of their Great Recordings of the Century."
3,Too basic,"If you want to watch the big Ronnie trainning some basic exercises, you will see it on this DVD. But don't expect a full documental interview or something like Arnold's first movie. This is very simple and basic. Looks like somebody take a domestic camera and start recording Ronnie on his trainning. Anyway you will see him doing what 99,9999% of us will never can do :)"
3,Horizontal Shed,"Very easy to put together. However, it was my impression from the description that there were shelves inside, but there are none (you have to purchase them separately) The top stays open very well, but it does give a little trouble on the closing. All in all it is serving its purpose"
1,water bottle sipper,"It does not work. I wish I could return them and get a refund. I was excited to get these because my grandbaby grabs at my Disani water bottle all the time trying to get a drink. They do not fit the bottle correctly. It goes on at an angle, and the water leaks out. I've tried and tried to get it on tightly but it ends up almost bending the top of the bottle, you have to use force and it still won't work."
2,Boring........,"I think this is not jazz absolutely! the songs are very similar and repetitive except the track #7,3,6 (good!) the other ones sounds more like electronic trash.... I don't suggest you to buy this cd only if you want to hear some different/rare music.Miles Davis and Wes Montgomery should be dying again in their tombs with this CD , Hehehehehe......!! :) :)"
5,Elisha Cuthbert is great!,"Elisha Cuthbert, the lead, is one of the best child actresses i have seen! I love this movie and hope it makes it to DVD!"
5,"I ordered this for someone else but watched it first, great","I checked out the cover, it looked great,popped it in, it worked, what more can I ask for. I'm not picky, I just want to watch a non-scratched dvd."
2,AIR(port 1975) + Speed (2) = Airspeed,"Not much new here. It's all been done before. The title says it all. Same plots, for the most part. You're better off getting Airport 1975 and, if you must, Speed 2. Good for an afternoon popcorn movie though. Just make sure you have enough to keep you occupied."
1,avoid this game at all costs,"This game is terrible and should not be played by anyone... ever... It's not even close to being fun the controls are bad, and there's no point to playing it at all..."
3,dry season,"The four seasons on blu-ray is a little dry. It is bass shy, the detail was there, but, thin and lifeless. I prefer my CD version better."
1,Walking Billboard,"The picture is innacurate, the entire outside is covered with a huge WHITE logo for Kelly detectors.They should pay me to wear the darn thing!!"
1,BOOK OUTDATED,"I got this book at the library for free when it was clearing out some books. THe book unfortunately is outdated and was published before the internet revolution came along. Unless one buys this book as a collection item, I don't see the use for it as most stores listed in the book are no longer in existence; some stores are still in existence but have different addresses; and, of course, no web page links are included.All in all, this book is well out of date and serves no practical purpose."
3,Sort of inbetween,"This movie was really just - okay. It has so many twists, and turns I don't even think I could explain it. The songs were good and Lana Turner was perfect for 'Red,' but the movie dragged in some places and it seems very, very long. Judy Garland does a splendid job singing (of course), and I really loved the song 'Laugh.' Heddy Lamar is just breathtakingly beautiful and her accent is delightful. Overall, it was a good movie, just a little boring. Jimmy Stewart also plays Lana Turner's boyfriend, and he's always a joy to watch! Something else that was disappointing was the false advertising: Color. It's not. As plain as day it's in black and white. But everybody of course has different opinions. This movie while a little dull to me, may be highly entertaining to someone else. So, don't take my word for it. See it for yourself and form your own opinion!!"
5,exelent John Williamson,"One of his best albums, Chandlier of stars is as good as any american baladier I have listened to, worth the money!"
1,Fracaso total!,"Mi gato no le hace caso en lo mas minimo, se lo apliqué en su juguete y nada de nada, no se puso loco, ni corrió como decia el producto.No se si se deba a que mi gato tiene 8 años y ya no le interesa o que pasa, la verdad no entiendo.Ahora no se que hacer con el producto."
2,lots of sharp twigs,"My cats seem to like the smell of this catnip. However, I usually crush catnip to release the scent before I give it to the cats. With this product, I have been getting sharp splinters from the woody part of the plant in my fingers. I have noticed the cats sometimes seem to also get jabbed. I won't buy this brand again."
1,Not So Xtreme,"My cat recently freaked out over some catnip that came with a bed I bought him so I thought I'd order some more. I couldn't find the same brand but this ""Xtreme"" catnip sounded like it might do the trick. Not even close. My husband swears he saw our cat lift up his paw and yawn after smelling it. If your cat is like mine you'll probably get a better reaction out of any other catnip out there."
1,Cat won't go near it,I bought this catnip because I couldn't find the brand I wanted on Amazon. I opened it immediately but the cat won't go near it. I've tried different ways to get her to interact to no avail. I would save your $5 and buy another brand. There is nothing spectacular about this product.

4,"Deep, rich story, made unnecessarily difficult to read.","Good, engaging writing, but made much harder to read because HE DOESN'T PUNCTUATE. Most annoyingly, he doesn't put what his characters are saying in quotation marks, so the reader is left to try to sort out where a descriptive phrase ends, and where the voice of a character begins. The guy has a good reputation, and possibly thinks he's risen to the level of stardom that the extra keystrokes necessary to properly punctuate his writing are a waste of his precious time. Earth to Just: Punctuation enhances readability."
4,Just Terrific,"Ward Just is such a terrific writer -- this is one of his best books along with ""Echo House."" The world he creates in Eisenhower-era Chicago almost feels like a snowglobe that, once shaken, shows its lack of tranquility and contradictions. This is a fanastic work."
3,quality of e-version,I thought the book was tedious in its detail.But I was more than disappointed with the quality of the e-version. I have never read so many misspelled words!!! And words were omitted as well. Best the publishers should update their spellcheck!
2,Oh My!,"An Unfinished Season became an unfinished book for me. The more I read it, the less interested I became. The plot just wandered around, tuxedo and all."
3,"Gorgeous writing, spot on historically but a bit sad","Although An Unfinished Season cannot compare to Just's recent Forgetfulness it was still a pleasure to read for the language alone. I don't agree with the other reviewers who thought the characters were not engaging. I grew up in the 50s and each one of these characters literally reeked of the emotional suppression of that period. What was difficult for me was that none of them seemed to enjoy anything very much. And as suppressed as we were in the 50's we had a lot of damned fun. Another thing not noted by other reviewers was the HINT of some kind of taboo love/attachment between Aurora and Jack. Now that would have been quite enough to make Jack end it all especially in the 50s. Forget the Bataan Death March...his attachment to Aurora was clearly off the 50s radar. No matter what, Just can certainly dance a beautiful dance with the English language. I wish for more like Forgetfulness which is a book I simply cannot get out of my mind."
4,Excellent recording,"The only minor flaws in this recording are weak brass in some important moments, such as the first and second ""fate motifs"" in the first movement, and the usual ""flat"" Naxos sound, which reduces the sheer power that the percussion usually give this piece.However, neither one detracts entirely from this thrilling, chilling performance. The ""hammer hits"" are appropriately doom-laden. The drama and tension are tremendous in this recording. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing to me,"Sadly, there is NOT a large section of color images, just a few pages. Without color these pictures do not convey much. Perhaps I feel this way because I am a visual artist, but I need to see the color to understand these images. There is no place online that I can find that offers these images in color.Do not buy this book thinking that its pictures are worth much. Perhaps the words will have enough value for others to make it worth its high price, but for me it was a sad disappointment."
1,Transaction Evaluation,"Amazon and carrier handled this transaction badly. This product was delivered without a left front door. Amazon did not respond to my inquiry regarding this missing part. After several conversations with the carrier, they finally delivered the product to me. I was able to get a left front door by contacting Rubbermaid customer service directly. Rubbermaid delivered the part to me via Fedex about two weeks later. I felt that Amazon should have credited me for this problem and inconvenience."
2,A Misleading Book,"Though much of his information is accurate, Nadler makes the crucial error of relying only on wriiten text, ignoring the vast rich oral history of this historic topic. In addition he declares that ""half of todays Orthodox Jews are Mithnagdim"", this iserroneous. ""Mithnagdim"" literally means ""opposed"", there is no longer any substantial oppositionto Chassidism among Orthodox Jews. Though roughly half are not Chassidim per se, thay include many Sefardim and others who never opposed Chassidus. Even among Lithuanian Jewry, only a small percentage actually follow the customs of the revered Gaon of Vilna, and many of their descendants have now incorporated many Chassidic teachings and customs."
4,Light-hearted but Thought Provoking,I read this book in one day during the 1996 Olympics. It includes hevy use of technology that a young man comes into contact with. If you like other Heimerdinger books then you'll love this one.
2,Just the lamp,"I feel I was duped somewhat as what I received was just the lamp itself and did NOT include the cage assembly, but the picture clearly shows it in the assembly."
1,She's No Mammy....,I've done a little research on this powerful black woman who wanted to help black people become free of slavery and I came across her writings that she never wanted to be called Mammy. That's what the white mind saw her as and called her in those times. Why would someone want to call her Mammy in this day and age???This is a reflection of the unconscious racism that exist in the minds of some white people today.;
5,The DEFINITIVE Web Publishing Book,"You're NOT a real Web publisher unless you have this book on your bookshelf. Stanek's writing is like a brilliant light guiding you to create terrific Web pages! I highly recommend this book!Lots of great examplesGreat insightsGreat design tipsAs someone who learned how to publish on the Web from this book, I am a perfect example of how great this book is. Without this book I never would have been able to publish a home page. Thanks Mr. Stanek for creating such a wondeful book. I plan to read all of your books--but it will take me awhile."
1,Information is Too Old,"Although this book has great content, the information is too outdated. According to this book Java and frames, are not supported by IE. This book is still teaching HTML 2 and HTML 3 (not 3.2). Don't expect to learn that much about Java and CGI from this book either because it explains what they are more that it teaches how to create applets and scripts using them."
2,Not for beginners,"I bought this book after taking on the task of learning *gasp* all of the facets of web programming and design, hoping this would be current information. A lot of it is. If you're still developing and writing HTML in the 3.0 version. I was surprisingly let down by this part of the Unleashed series, which is usually known for high quality info. Not that it isn't a good book, it's just out of date. ** Wondering how to get money back now **.. My advice.. keep looking. This one is just not current enough to be useful for so much of what's new now. Sorry Mr. Stanek, et al."
5,Still relevant!,"I just purchased this book, I am also a web designer, although it is already outdated the theories presented by the author makes this book relevant to newer versions of HTML etc.This book is still a must for designers and a would be CLASSIC!"
5,EXCELLENT!!,"This console is the best! First of all, the graphics are great! The sound quality is as good as an unscratched cd! And, the controllers are really easy to get used to. Even if I have a friend over who hasn't ever played one got used to the names and the controller memorized by the end of the day. Buy it NOW!"
4,Satisfying the kid in all of us,I remember playing on this game system for hours in college and never finding a dull moment. It brought room mates and dorm mates together and kept you from boozing out ;-)
5,Best System until game cube,I cant wait for game cube. Nintendo has alway provided the best in entertainment. I hope it continues with Gamecube. I saw some pictures for the new Zelda and it is awesome. As for 64 it is way better than the Super. Great graphics. Especailly With DK 64 and Majora's mask. Forget Playstation and Sega. Go with Nintendo. Anyway Its the end of the line for Sega they announced a deal that they are talking with Nintendo to Send Sonic to Nintendo. That will be great Sonic is Sega's only good game. But until then we have the 64 and I love it
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"RECEIVED NINTENDO 64 CONSOLE DIRTY AND NOT WORKING WITH ONE CONTROLLER MISSING ???CARLOS VELARDEGLENDALE,CA."
1,"Horrible, just Horrible","I can't believe I ever wanted this ... system.I chose a Playstation and I'm glad I did.Problems with this system:1Complicated controller.2As you can see there will probably be no new games for this stupid system.3The game prices are sky high than those of Cds.(i.e. P.S.one games and sega dreamcast games)4YOU have to have those ... accesiries for most games.Those are the ones I want to put for now but there's more(Traveling problems,freezzing problems,etc.)Conclusion:Wait for the Gamecube or buy a P.Sone or Sega Dreamcast,those systems are much better."
3,Great System.. but not satisfying,"The Nintendo 64 has been out for quite long now.... sure it has great games, and it is also DURABLE However, with the money you're paying, buy a PS or invest a bit more and buy a Dreamcast The Nintendo game cartridges cost more than discs and it is simply toooo outdatedI would personally stick with a dreamcast Nintendo64 is not for ""THE GAMER"" but.. if you're a Nintendo fan and really want a Nintendo product, wait for the Game Cube to come out. It will promise more than what the Nintendo 64 currently offers."
1,"NEVER BUY USED , FROM duker8888 !!","I GOT A NINTENDO CONSOLE 64,THAT DOES NOT WORK, DIRTY WITH ONE CONTRLLLER ONLY ??, NO INVOICE TO FILE A CLAIM.CARLOS VELARDEGLENDALE,CA. 91206"
3,"Old, bad Graphics, but still fun","I woud say very fun games are made by N64, but u need better graphics and it need newer games. GameCube has much better graphics anyway. I giving this three stars though for how fun it is."
3,??,"I personally dont know why every1 likes this.. i bought this system and 13 games at a garage sale. I played super mario 64 and beat it in a week. After that game, i searched for more of the 12 games. I tried every single one, and i hated all of them. Its not nintendos fault, its the people hired to make their games."
2,Nintendo 64,"I got my N64 in 1997 and I owned a SNES for 5 years before that. I can honestly say that the N64 as a whole was a waste of money. Most of the games that came out I didnt like and the ones I did were too expensive. Nintendo still has the nerve to charge $... for the best seller games, even if they are 5 years old. The only games I really liked were Goldeneye and the San Francisco Rush games. The rest of the games dont look appealing or they lose their apeal quickly. Whats worse is that popular games like Perfect Dark are expensive to begin with, but to play the whole thing, you have to buy a $... Memory card, which is a total ripoff. Thats why Im going to get a PS One becase I can deal with $... games that actually look fun to play. Overall my SNES is more fun. Its too bad they dont make old copies of those games."
2,Fun....AT FIRST,"After buying this conole in 1997 I was blown away by the graphics and controls....remember this is 3 years ago. In this age it doesn't stand a chance. In competition with Sony's Playstation and Playstation2 the Nintendo64 is blown out of the water. In retaliation of the Playstation consoles they have TRIED to come out with a better one, there is one con to this plan, the Game Cube costs a fortune with a few petty additions to make you think you didn't waste your money. So if you're faced with the decision of buying a Nintendo64 or a Playstation(2) get the Sony."
3,Good for what it does,"For what it was intended to do, namely displaying large numbers of textured polygons with a smooth framerate, the N64 performs very well. Games like Mario 64, the two Zeldas, and Perfect Dark illustrate this nicely. However, if you're looking for a game that doesn't feature rendered polygons, good luck with the N64! Paper Mario is the only one in that category that I can recall at the moment.The biggest problem with this system, however (at least as far as I'm concerned) is the almost total lack of good RPGs. Quest 64 is, frankly, bad, and the two Zeldas are more puzzle games than anything else. I am not aware of any other attempts at role-playing games on this system.To sum it all up, if you're looking for good, visually-impressive action/adventure games, this might be the system for you. If, however, you're looking for something more in keeping with the traditional Nintendo ""feel,"" I'd have to recommend picking up either a PSOne or Dreamcast."
5,Best system on the planet.,"Nintendo 64 is the best system to date. So what if it doesn't have as many games as the Playstation, who cares? So long as the games that it does have are really awesome (i.e. Zelda is the greatest game ever, Mario 64, Perfect Dark, D.K., Slugfest, and F-Zero X)it'll do fine. Another thing, loading time is a non factor here, Playstation takes to [darn] long, and cartrages are far more durable than CD's, so you can slam your cartrages around and they don't get busted.In conclusion, N64 is the best system for games, fun, and multiplayer because of it's four controller ports. I suppose that's why they call it ""The Fun Machine""."
4,N64&#65533;The Ultimate Console,"The Nintendo 64 has the best array of features I have yet seen. While the games are more expensive than Playstation, they are better. The controller is easier to hold, and easy to use. One Word: GoldenEye. You want a great system and are willing to pay a lot for each game (which you will have to buy again, since cartridges will be exstinct soon)? Get the N64. You wanna cheap out and sacrifice a little of your gaming experience? Get a PLaystation and watch it LOAD!"
3,N64 is good...,"The N64 is a Great Console. N64 only has a few good games the rest aren't so good. If you take my advice go for the dreamcast, which has more variety of games.The only down side is that sega stopped making games for the dreamcast. So the choice is N64 with 64 bit graphics, pricey cartdridges, and only a few good games or Dreamcast with 127 bit graphics, cheap cd's, and lots of great games. Also, the n64's memory cards are just that, Dreamcast's are a practically whole game in themselves, Dreamcast has a modem too."
4,A little pricy considering the competition,"The N64 is a nice gaming platform and has alot of cool features. Nice graphics, decent games, and a user friendly interface. The one reason I would buy this console personaly is because of Tony Hawks Proskater. This Game uses all of N64's graphics and the ease of use goes beond simplicety. I am going to get a N64 over a playstation because it just looks allot prettier, and because of Tony Hawks Proskater. Hehehe. ="
4,She's that little system that could,"You've probably heard/read from many magazines and reviewers that the Nintendo 64 is comparable to the House of Usher: fallen. But the truth is that Nintendo 64 has a lot to offer. She doesn't have as many games her cousin, the Sony Playstation, but the N64 can hold her own in the console wars with exlcusive hits like Super Mario 64, Perfect Dark, and Wave Race 64 to name a few. Nintendo 64's main weakness has been that she uses cartridges instead of CDs: cartridges are more expensive and would cost billions to hold as much memory as CDs.Should you decide to purchase this system (if you haven't already), here is a list of my recommended games:Super Mario 64Perfect DarkBanjo-KazooieBanjo-TooieMischief MakersWave Race 64Goemon's Great AdventureDiddy Kong RacingThese are just a few games. Experiment a bit and see what suits you."
4,Nintendo,I own Nintendo64 and it rocks! cds it takes a while to load.But n64 dosnt.The games roooocks! But it is old now but hay it is still cool.
4,An Okay System,i personally do not own a N64 but i did borrow my friends for a month and a half during his summer vacation and it was fine. I myself prefer a gamecube but this would end up being my second choice. the controllers are okay. the cartridge makes for no load times but are expensive! overall a 4 star system
3,good console,"The Nintendo 64 gives amazing graphics, but they use them on the worst games. Pokemon, Dragon Ball...etc. who cares. I would like better games for a game console that offers 64 bits!"
2,Needs More Green,"I am a green eyed person and I liked the introduction,poems and captions about green eyes in this book. The pictures were lovely and colorful. However, I think there should have been more green eyed people depicted. I didn't like seeing multiple pictures of the same people over and over again. One picture of each person should have been enough."
5,A great gift idea,"I enjoyed Green Eyes greatly. I gave three copies to friends, who all enjoyed the book. It make a great gift for people who have green eyes and for those of us who enjoy photography."
2,Yawn,"Sorry, but the pictures do not tell the story.What's with the repeated photos of the glassy-eyed full-lipped dark-haired guy? Ick, he's in love with either himself or the photographer, and it's not reflected as art. And the poor fella with the weepy, weepy eyes? Huh?I hate to think this was a work of research and art. I can find more green-eyed people in my building at work with only 1000 employees than this photographer found.We green-eyed ones are diverse and the lore/history in the text was nice, but it's also found on the author's web-site. If you want depth, art, and green-eyes, a mirror will provide better results (if you are a green-eyed one...)"
5,ALOT OF BLUSEY GUITAR BY A MASTER JAMMER !!,"WOW if you listened to the amazon soundbytes and wanted a blues guitar disc, You would sure pass this up, BUT This guy in fact plays some of the best rockin & blusey guitar you're gonna find & lots of it! EVERY discs he appears on is chocked full of ""TASTY, BLUESEY, ROCKIN GUITAR ! If you like guitar you will LOVE this disc and find yourself searching out any others by GARTH WEBBER... If you ever get a chance to hear or purchase the ""GREAT"" ""S.F. BLUES GUITAR SUMMIT VOL II you'll find Garth trading off lead guitar runs with two other obscure guitarist. The S.F. Blues Guitar Summit Discs #1 - #2 and #3 all feature tons & tons of blues guitar jammin' and GARTH WEBBER was chosen to be one of the masters to perform for ya. Oh Yeah, He's A really good singer too !"
5,Great Toy!,"This toy is great! My son absolutly loves it!! It comes with a drill that has a reverse setting, so you can screw both in and out. The plane comes completely apart but is easy to put back together. My son is only 18 months old, and although he needs help with the drill, he loves putting the screws in and out. The screws are nice and big and overall the toy is well made. I think my son loves this toy so much because it makes him feel like Daddy with his own tools!"
2,Overhyped. Oversaturated. Dense.,"This book is being used for the mythology portion of an upper division course at UCLA entitled Chinese Mythology and the Supernatural. It is entirely too dense to read casually, and anyone attempting to read this book for even light analysis is going to be extremely challenged. Birrell writes well, but unfortunately there isn't any sense of transition from story to story, nor is there a sense of clarity - she merely throws small blurbs of them together, grouped by whomever the main character is. She cites all of her research quite well- but unfortunately, it doesn't make up for the fact that this book is migraine-inducing for the undergraduate level student. I wouldn't recommend this book at all unless you're a scholar in Chinese studies, and/or your research requires it."
2,Offers little to the aspiring box builder.,"The book presents attractive photographs of a number of boxes that will stimulate aspiring beginning and intermediate box builders.Though offered to suggest ""how to"" construction guidance, especially with plans, the book has only the most meager detail of construction and nothing that can truly be called plans. The introduction warns readers that the boxes presented ought not be copied and if they are legal action is a possibility. The result is a book more bent on preventing copies of the displayed boxes than providing useful information for the box building reader."
2,mainly for devotees,"This is a short book by a devotee of American born mystic Adi Da, some of whose books I have already reviewed(eg, see The Knee of Listening). It is a very personal account interspersed with quotes from his other writings intended as an intro for those who know nothing about him."
4,Works Great - Was delivered Quickly.,"This product arrived when it was scheduled. It was easy to install(and I am no computer nerd). In fact, I am using wireless to write the review.The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because my main computer has to stay on in order for my wireless service to remain on. Everytime my computer ""powers down"" the wireless network gets cut off. There might be a better answer than leaving the computer on all of the time - but I am unaware of it. Other than that, the instalation was a breeze and I have had no problems with the secured wireless signal that is transmitted from the device."
5,Great & EZ,"Very easy to set up even for a dummy like me who has no clue what end goes where non the less what some of the terms mean. Customer service answered without me even being put on hold & was helpful and friendly (just don't say to them that it's ""Chinese"" to you, they don't seem like that). Works perfectly without any problems. Highly recommended!!"
5,Rock solid!,"I decided to upgradre from a Linksys WRT54G to this one, basically because the linksys would drop signal several times a week, and I was experiencing problems with my Vonage adapter.The zyxel is rock solid. It actually does it's job. Strong signal, my voip works great.Exceeded expectations."
4,extended range,This router tripled the range of my old D-Link. It was very easy to setup. The only problem that I ran into is that my unit stopped working after a month. Amazon immediately sent a replacement.
4,just what the doctor ordered.,"Only good things to say, fast and easy set up, no problems with wireless connection, have an old B linksys NIC and 100Mbit LAN setup both running XP. great connection anywhere in the house. simple configuration interface. had it for 2 months."
4,"Excellent, as long as it doesn't have 1.4 firmware on it","Bought it based on excellent reviews and the need for the QoS feature. It had the 1.4 firmware on it, which is known to be flaky and did seem to be in my case. I tried to back it down to 1.3 without success, and then tried to upgrade it to a 1.5 Beta release and bricked it. I did an advance RMA and got another one direct from Zyxel. It had 1.3 and has been working as well as all the positive reviews said it would. So, a bit of a hassle in my case, but it ended well. On a positive note, the shipping on the original purchase was amazingly fast."
5,Works great with our Macs,"I've installed 2 of these in a PC network and was thrilled with them. I've now installed another at work, networking 4 Macs - 2 wired, 2 wireless. The wireless Macs are across the building, down in a basement/dungeon. Cell phones do not work down there. I thought I would have to install a booster. Don't need to... the signal strength is excellent! Plug and play. The wired Macs are OS 10.3.9. The wireless Macs are brand new Imacs running Leopard."
1,Wireless is off by default. Cannot be unlocked without connecting.,"My wired ethernet port died and I needed to get some critical work done. The wireless LAN is off by default and cannot be activated without first connecting to the router through the ethernet or using an indirect method of establishing a WPA key with a USB memory stick. Although I received a message saying the installation via the USB memory stick was successful, the router did not appear in my list of wireless networks, nor did it when I attempted to power cycle the router. Attempts to connect to the ethernet LAN port after purchasing a new PCMCIA were unsuccessful (I used a straight-thru cable). I then purchased a NetGear router and I was able to configure through the ethernet without any problems. Having set up 15 brands/models of wireless routers, this was by far the most frustrating and unpleasant experience I've had."
1,Do NOT buy for a Mac only network,"After much frustration with trying to setup the router through Safari on the Mac, I finally switched on the PC. Aahhh. It actually does work well after all.Almost all of the setup options kept producing errors when trying to setup on the Mac, but worked smoothly on the PC. Very annoying."
5,Got it Today,"I got it today, followed the set up instructions and it works great. It works! This was a replacement for my Linksys Wireless G Router which died on me a few days ago. The ZyXel is much more easier to set up than the Linksys. The Key is also very easy reconfigure to your own setting."
2,Stopped working after less than a year,"I just expect a router that works. After a year this completely stopped working.Also, it couldn't seem to handle DNS with my cable modem. I had to set up special settings that I know are not required for this particular modem and cable connection with most routers."
1,Gonna have to pass on this one...,"Looks nice out of box but after that, wow, Sucksville, USA.Connection drops out a few times every hour, regardless of setting, and that's the LAN connection.Not a good thing. Maybe mine's faulty, but for the price, ask yourself if it's worth paying for, to find out it's faulty, defective or plain just doesn't work for you. D-"
1,At least I got one defective,"I recently bought this unit on Amazon on August 2007. My unit was completely defective. When I turned on the wireless switch on my router, it did not respond even if i make a ping and the WLAN and WAN leds do not turn on. I have no connectivity to it at all. This problem appeared since i began using it. There is a forum about this problem. For more details look at: http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r18551201-Zyxel-X550-Radio-Switch-Disables-UnitHope this information get you aware of this product before buying it. In my case, i went through a refund."
4,Very Good Router,I have owned this router now for about three weeks and find it to be very reliable. I have given it 4 stars because I have had to reset the router twice since I have started using it. The X-550 has to be reset because my laptop will not recognize the wireless network until the reset button is pushed. Once this is done it works very well and there is no pattern to when it needs to be reset. I would recommend this router. Compared to other routers I have used it is by far the most reliable and has the best range.
3,Good but not that good!!!,"This is simply a Marillion cd that they seem to like a lot as musicians and creative force. They went for the grooves on some of the songs. This work is far away from the rest of the band body of work. For me the stand out songs are: ""MAP OF THE WORLD"" a song that shoud have been a smash single if radio were not in the mess. Also, the first song and ""This is the 20 century""...the rest are songs they seem to create while improvising. These do not mean they are bad songs, no, simply they are ""diferent"" to what the band does.Marillion is a band that you can buy any cd and you will be pleased. They are one of the world s' best bands."
1,Probably the weakest Marillion album,"This may be an even worse CD than Radiation. Easily the best song on this is This Is The 21st Century, which does not even rank up with their better material. I must be missing something, because it seems that most reviewers really like this CD. It may be a very slow grower, as I did not like either Seasons End or Afraid Of Sunlight on the first several listens, but eventually these became my 2 favorites of the H-era. I have given this CD several listens over the past several months to find what I am missing, but finally have had to give up. I can no longer bear to listening to this disk once they get to the yell-singing in Quartz. I am hoping they rebound on their next release as Marillion has yet to make two bad albums in a row."
5,what an awesome album!!!,"this album is worth paying for even if it was single with the song ""This is the 21st Century""... this is my favorite song of all my fish, marillion albums to date. Download this song using aimster.com but then buy a cd."
2,MainStreamMarillion,"It's a good CD, it's entertaining and well written. It is not a good Marillion CD. I got into this band because of the music of course, now they are a mainstream rock band, and it looks as if they intend to stay that way. Straight forward drum beats, hooky guitar riffs. We all understand the need a band has to grow and evolve, but to completely change your music style... This band has it's following because of what they were. They will never be a successful main-stream rock band, it's not going to happen. I wish them luck, I'm still a fan, but I'm not feeling the love."
4,"not great, but not bad either","well, the title pretty much sums up my opinion of this album. it is by no means week, but at the same time, seems to lack any one stand out track. Anoraknophobia pretty much just goes along being enjoyable, but certainly not breath taking or groud breaking. however, i would still buy the album again, and wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from trying it."
2,Marillion ...really ?,"Another deception for me, there is some good pop rock songs, like ""Between you and me"", ""Quartz"", ""Map of the World"" and some good songs more like Marillion fans are used to like ""When I meet God"" and ""This is the 21st Century"" but it is a bad album for a band like Marillion. They can do much better than this."
2,Fear of mediocre music,"Limp fisted, hard soft rock which can hardly be said to justify these apparent pretentious release circumstances finds the lightly progressive unit churning out some of their blandest late-career work under the guise of accessibility."
2,"Pretentious as ever, but not that good as they used to be!","I've got no idea why Marillion is trying so hard to sound like pretentious acts such as Radiohead, Massive Attack, and all these other hyped bands from England. I can understand their financial problems, but that's no reason to sell your heart and soul. It would have been way much better to create something that is their own. Don't get me wrong, because it's another good thing to make innovative music. However, Marillion is not that kind of band, because their are best in doing what they've done with magical records such as Clutching at Straws, Misplaced Childhood, and Afraid of Sunlight. Another problem with this latest release is the chaotic structure of the music. Whatever happened to the song writing? Endless pieces of music combined with useless sound fragments. The singing of Steve Hogarth fails to impress as well. I'm sorry to say, but Marillion it ain't. All I hear is a bunch of old rockers trying to be hip or whatsoever."
5,"all you 1 stars, stop whining...","I was one of the 12000+ who preordered this album way back in 2000. I've had almost a year now listen to this wonderful piece of music. True, some of the songs did take a bit to grow on me, but now I think they all are great. I think ""21st Century"" and ""When I Meet God"" work well.I've seen comments that this is no longer a prog band. Well, I think they have progressed. Let's be realistic, wouldn't we all rather see new music than to see them turn into caricatures of themselves singing karaoke in concert?Listen to this album. Really listen to it, forget that it is Hogarth and not Fish, forget that it is even Marillion. Forget the comparisons to Massive Attack, et al. Listen to the music.I liked this album, I consider it one of their best. True, it is not as good as Straws, Childhood, or AoS, but that doesn't matter. It is still a great album. Endless comparison to prior albums is useless. There is no real context.Listen to the music!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,TIGHT,"THIS CD IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN THEIR FIRST ONE, IT HAS SOME GOOD HARD BEATS. SOME PRETTY GOOD LYRIC, AND SOME GOOD RYDIN MUSIC."
2,Lame is all I gotta say! Oh yeah and don't waste your money!,Just horrible. Good try though but they should have tried harder.Not worth your time or money.
2,user unfreindly edition,"no index, no table of contents, no real spce between books, pages of notes after each book i the exact format and typeface as the book. I had to turn one page at a time for thousands of pages just to find where the one I wanted started."
2,thumbs down for format!,"thanks mjtco81 for providing an outline for the book (see dec 15, 2011 ) but that being said... i can only give this work a low rating. a collection this vast should always have an index, with subsections if the the discourse proves especially long. neglecting details like this only discourages would be readers!!!"
4,careful,"i love love love this watch!!! the rose gold isn't very rosy or gold, more closer to copper witch is a big part of why i love it being I'm not a fan of gold at all. i did have one issue that when the watch was assembled the company did not push the straps into the lugs far enough and both sides fell out.... easy fix push the pins back in. i have other Russian divers but this is my 1st diver akula and it is striking and big and beautiful very nice classy eye catching watch i recommend it very much"
5,Akula Mootahtah...It means no worries!,"I have 3 Akulas (2 with leather bands and 1 with the Polyurethane band). I absolutely enjoy wearing them (the white chronograph especially) and the fit is perfect for my wrist. Although it is an oversized watch, it tends to not appear that way when I wear it. The band is very adequate unlike those on my regular Russian Divers. I would buy another if it varied greatly in appearance from the 3 that I have now."
4,rosetone akula,great price for large scale watch make sure you have the wrist to wear it comes with very nice leather band the only negative comment I have on it is that pin came off the first day I wore it able to fix and continue wearing it.
5,Brilliant music,"Yeah yeah - they sound like the cure. Blah blah blah.Actually, the Essence have a much purer and refined sound than the Cure, with a cleaner, more ethereal production. While you can't escape the similarities of many of their melodies to the Kings of Shoe-Gazing, lead-singer Hans Diener's voice evolved with each album.But if you are looking for something on the darkwave/alt pop side of the spectrum, this compilation of singles will not disappoint you. My favorites are all here, including A Mirage, Cat, and How You Make Me Hate. But I still recommend you pick up the albums 'Nothing Lasts Forever' and 'A Monument of Trust'"
3,Ideal for owners of the average cat only!!!,"This book is ideal only if you have an average cat. The book is good and well written. It has cute quotes, interesting facts and a terrific, breif history of cats. Also a few funny tails;that I find to be Animal Planet worthy. However, it's just not sutible for the not so average cat. It has limeted answers. If a person has a unusall(ie: my cat Sharky)cat it can be very hard to answer. Thus makeing it extremly hard to ""rank"" a persons cat. Overall the book is good and I do recomend it. If anything for novelty perposes;or a party gag!!!"
2,Broke First Use,"On the first time use, simply brushing a layer of snow with the telescopic handle extended, I had the plastic latching mechanism break away from the steel handle. Small set screw had must have fallen out / not been installed.Preformed a self repair; works up to par.Telescopic extension will get frozen stuck if you use it and leave it in a cold car."
4,It absolutely does it's work,"I like it's length - you can rich very far with that brush so you don't have to run around you car to remove the snow. Plus it has ""rubber"" blade which is very good in clearing windows.One cons is that pivoting part doesn't look very firm. Time will show if that suspicion was right :)The other one (both pros and cons) is that it's telescopic handle is made of steel which can freeze and get stuck.Having said that - the brush is very good and I like it.Edited 12/09/2010It still works."
5,Hopkins Subzero,This is a heavy duty scraper that extends well and allows you to brush off snow and ice without having to over-reach even for larger SUV sized vehicles. Construction seems solid and it adjusts even while wearing gloves. It beats most of what is on the shelves here in Wisconsin.
3,Makes scraping the middle of a big window easy!,This snow scraper has just the right length to handle the snow in the middle of the windshield without having to stretch too far. The telescoping feature does get stuck but with a little gentle manipulation you can get it to retract. The soft grips are a nice touch.
5,Awesome series,All three books make a fantastic read. This is the last bood in the series and it leaves you wanting more to read after you are done.
2,Much Smaller Than It Appears,"I received this item as a birthday gift after adding it to my wishlist. It is a beautiful pendant, but it's the tiniest piece of Tanzanite I have ever seen! It almost looks like it was meant as a child's necklace. You would be better off going to a jewelry store to purchase a similar item, so you can at least see the actual size. I have several other pieces of Tanzanite jewelry and based on what they cost, for the price of this item, you could easily find a much larger piece."
4,"Sing, Spell Read & Write (pre-K program)","It's great for all pre-k children. With the the singing of the shapes, colors or phonetics my child is using both right brain & left brain together. It's fun for my child and the same time he doesn't realize he is learning."
5,"sing, spell, read, and write progam",I remeber this when i was little my mom got this program for me before i started school and It is awesome an dnow that i have a duaghter of my own wher she is a little older i will be using it for her I am so glad that they stil make it. I remeber my teacher would get mad at my mom cause I could read so well and knew more than the other kids. It is a good program cuse i can read and I can read well. I liked it and I hope my daughter will too.
4,Great customer service!,"I feel very lucky! I bought one used at a garage sale for $20.00!!! A hinge was broke and the locking parts were missing.I called rubbermaid with the part #'s and they are shipping the replacement parts out to me free of charge!!I had to clean and re-assemble the shed without instructions. It was very easy all I did was made sure the ground was level and used a little common sense. I made a replacement hinge out of a plastic tube (a wooden dowel would work also)and I think it is sturdier than the original!With the great customer service experience, I will definately buy rubbermaid again!!"
3,Leaker,"I just recently assembled the unit (easy job) and after using it for a couple of weeks, I have seen that it leaks a fair amount of water in and around the doors and the sliding roof panel.A call and E-mail(including pictures to Rubbermaid) gave me no satisfaction. It seems that there is no implied guarantee against leakage. Unfortunately that is why I bought the shed. An outdoor shed that leaks really is not a good thing. Buyer beware as there is no recourse in the event of a leaker!"
1,MIssing a panel!,"Ordered it at a savings by back order and color and received 2 x boxes strapped together and construction was well under way and realized the front left wall was missing!!! Now so much BS to go through to get a replacement piece, how do you miss something that big in the packing?"
3,Rubbermaid shed,Too expensive for an all plastic shed.Pros: Durable plastic and easy contstruction.Cons: Plastic slide-lid roof would not snap into place on shed frame.
1,They Can Keep It!,"The box says ""No Tools Required"" and ""15 Minutes"" for assembly. I guess they wanted me to use my fingernail to screw in the screws. 15 minutes to assemble? Are they serious? Now that it's all assembled, I see that you really can't put all of your yard/garden tools in there. However, with a little tweaking, I think it would make a fabulous dog house."
1,Amazon has yet to deliver but is asking for a product review!,I was short shipped. Had a very difficult time getting in touch with Amazon to discuss the problem. Have now been told that the item is on back order and I will have to wait 8 weeks for delivery!!
2,Beware of lid,"The unit is very easy to assembly, but the sliding lid is poorly designed. If you lift up, even slightly, instead of sliding back the brackets break free and can't be replace successfully and permanently. The lid then comes off in a heavy wind or when being used in hot weather. Huge disappointment for a Rubbermaid product."
2,Doors fall off,I've had the slide lid shed for almost 2 years now and for the most part it does the job of storing all of the kids bikes and outdoor toys. The biggest issue I have with the shed it the poorly designed door hinges. The little plastic nubs that hold the door in place simply broke off. To fix this I've added decorative metal fence hinges which I bent to follow the contour of the doors. I have a feeling the hinges will now outlast the rest of the shed.
3,Not as solid as had hoped,Just purchased for childrens bicycles 9/07. Took my poor husband almost 2 hours to assemble because of all the parts. Once assembled saw it was not as solid as had hoped. Kind of wobbly. I just hope it stands up to our East Coast winters and rainy windy springs. That will remain to be seen.
4,Horizontal Sliding Shed for bikes usually,"I have to comment, this is 2nd online store for this shed, we already have one, and we bought it at Home Depot (standard stock item) about 2 yrs. ago, for $299.99.... I want another one for additional storage other than bikes (Mfr.# 3752) and the price only went up to $329.99.... so you can get it cheaper, you still could rent a home depot truck for $20 and still come out less expensive. Our plastic lock broke the first year, as one other review has mentioned, i do agree, overall, quickly assembed under 30 mins., and roomy and plastic has no signs of wear. Good luck shopping!"
4,rubbermaid slide-lid shed,"this shed is great!! it was easy to put together (i did the first 6 steps or so (out of 9 or so) by myself and i'm a small female. however, the one thing is that when u try to lock the roof into place, it won't go down into the track (u have to buy it to see what i mean). but my guy friend helped me and we simply used a heavy duty kitchen knife to trim down the little v-shaped things that stick down and then it fit right in. it has worked great for me and is large but not overpowering b/c it's short but deep. so it's not so huge looking from the front but still fits tons of stuff. i fit my bike, some suitcases, a vacuum, several boxes, and have room to spare. i have it on my patio in manhattan and it's a lifesaver!!"
2,functions well but came with a wrong piece,"Not hard to assemble, but after putting the shed mostly together I discovered that a wrong part was included in the package (there are supposed to be 2 left rails, 2 right rails, but I got 3 of one and 1 of the other, preventing me from completing assembly of the shed. Called customer support which sent out a replacement part right away. Has been functioning well since. Would have given it 4 out of 5 stars if not for the part problem."
4,Perfect for storing bicycles,"I bought this to store bicycles since we didn't have room in our garage. The assembly went smoothly until I got to the stubborn roof which took quite a bit of effort to slide and lock onto the walls. Even though you can put a padlock on the doors it is mostly for looks as you could slide the roof over the doors after a little bit of lifting. But hey, the whole shed is made out of plastic so it's not exactly meant to store gold bullion. It's reasonably sized and keeps our bicycles dry and out of sight."
4,"slide storage, door problems","The storage shed works great and is waterproof, however, the doors are unacceptably maldesigned because they come off, that is the left side door. It is poorly designed because the top spike that fits into the hole of the part above it is not long enough and unless a person does not adapt the door it will continually fall off when opened. This flaw needs to be addressed by Rubbermaid because this unit is waaaay too expensive for this to occur."
3,Missing parts!,"Ordered this storage shed online; had one at a previous address so I knew the dimensions and fit would work for our new place. Product arrived fairly quickly; but once we opened and started to assemble we realized there were NO accessory parts (screws, caps, levers, sliders/gliders) etc. Had to call Rubbermaid and was told it would take 2-3 weeks for the missing parts to arrive."
5,Nice And Ghoulish...,"HELLBOUND (BOOK OF THE DEAD) is an excellent creeper w/ a fantastically dismal atmosphere of doom. The characters are believable, the plot is oldschool terrifying (think MONKEY'S PAW / PET SEMATARY), and the finale is a grabber! If you love black magic and / or things that won't stay dead, then this belongs on your shriek-shelf! I always watch this one w/ the lights out..."
4,"Great Hard Boiled Detective, but w/ lots of humor","I read this book in college as part of a course on Detective Fiction. The professor (I believe) offered it along w/ Chandler and Dashiell Hammett as the quintescential anti-hero of the era. What I remember most was that while attempting to solve the case, the shamus seizes every opportunity to ""party"" for lack of a better word. Very funny, very well written."
2,If you liked Mickey Spillane..This book is for you.,"In the Cook County, IL morgue there is the body of a beautifulgirl no one knows who it is. This is the 1930's Chicago andWilliam Crane, a private Detective down on his luck decides heis going to find out who she is; after all there could be moneyin it for him and sure enough a wealthy NY family hears of thebody and decides it could be their daughter who spends alot oftime wandering around the country then of course Crane is moreinterested than ever.William Reuhlmann, Ph.D writes theforward and compares the story to many detective stories writtenin the 40' and Dashiell Hammett. I really do not agree. I see,Mickey Spillane written all over this book. To his fans, you willprobably very much enjoy this book. Just not my favorite type ofmystery."
3,"Mary, the Mother Of Jesus","The book was as described.....in good condition. But I was so disappointed to find that it didn't include a dust cover! The dust cover was part of what I loved about the book! So, yes, I was not completely satisfied with the purchase....I'm not going to return it but I would not have made the purchase if I had known the dust cover was missing."
4,bordering on hysterical,"The one liners are so clever. They are easy to memorize and make wonderful icebreakers at dinner, parties and the office.I especially enjoy the ""clean"" sex. At least I can understand the punchline."
4,A Good Story based on a Gimmick,"As this story slowly unfolds, coming together like a jigsaw puzzle, the reader begins to see a picture emerge which is both broader and more powerful than first expected.Don't be put off by the first few chapters, which set up the gimmick of alternating narrators. Within a very few chapters you are hooked and then the book draws you along inexorably to the momentous conclusion."
2,"Deeply disappointing, faulty morality & social perspective","The book delves very little into art, aside from introducing ""Roy G Biv"" (the color spectrum, red-orange-yellow...violet).Worse, I was offended by its outright snobbery toward poor/homeless people and its condescencion toward handicapped people. Its elitism on several other fronts was also questionable morality to put in front of young, impressionable minds.The use of silly names would have been appropriate in a short humorous story or 7~8yo kids' book; in this longer young-adults' book it wore on one's nerves."
1,False advertising,"Before buying, note that the ""book"" is really just an article from the magazine ASPToday. It is only 23 pages long, a fair amount of which is pictures and code. It contains many links into ASP Today's website only accessible to magazine subscribers.The article is basically a description of an application that demonstrates several features of SQLXML.The title of the ""book"" is false and misleading. While the title says ""Advanced"", read what the author himself says in the conclusion of the article: ""The purpose of the application is to demonstrate the basic principles and characteristics of several of the advanced SQLXML3.0 features. Clearly, much more work would be required to develop a full-scale business application"". There is nothing advanced about the demonstrated features -- they are the fundamental features of SQLXML and are the same features one sees throughout Microsoft's free documentation."
4,Awful cover/Fun songs,"If you can get past the racist cover, there are some terrific tunes on this Gran Combo set. Gran Combo has a strong track record so I cannot say that this album is one of their best; the title track put a smile on my face even if none of the other songs particularly stood out. Gran Combo fans who love their 60s work should be satisfied with the mastering and quality of the performances."

3,hello,i thought the cd could use a little more spunk to little of afrimation to boring. anyway it was still good.
1,Disappointing,I just received these and was very surprised to find out how poor the quality of workmanship was. I ordered two sets of bath towels and two sets of washcloths. Three of the four towels have threads hanging off of them with two of the towels having at least ten or more very long threads. Two of the washcloths have threads and one isn't finished off well at the edges. In addition to the sage set I ordered two sets of linen bath towels and two sets of linen washcloths. One of the linen towels looks a bit threadbare on the side and has a few short threads hanging off of it. I don't know how these could have passed through quality control. These towels are not acceptable and I am planning on returning them.
1,Towels change colors,"Pure junk, even before I washed it the towels changed color. I purchased 3 different sets being confident that Amazon wont' push crappy quality items, but it is not the case.If after you wash your hands and wipe them against brand new towel the color doesn't suppose to change. The description of them being soft is far from accurate as well.One lesson learned: I am not purchasing any more housewares from Amazon unless I am familiar with the product.Bottom line avoid it!"
5,soft & absorbent,"I read the reviews, and was a little put off by the negative ones. Maybe they got a bad batch, or maybe they usually purchase really expensive towels. I usually buy at wal-mart or on sale at sears, jc penney. I was very pleased with the quality of the towels. They are very soft and absorbent, and a great deal at about $4 each. I am planning to purchase more of these, today. I recommend this product."
1,Very Disappointed,"I just finished washing a set of these towels and I was horrified to discover the cotton is pilling. There are little bits of cotton everywhere. I am very surprised this happened since I have purchased Martex supima cotton towels for years. The colors are beautiful and the fabric is soft, but the towel is useless if I am covered with cotton bits when I dry off.I wish I had read the other reviews before I made my purchase. These towels are not anywhere near the quality I expect from a manufacturer like Martex. I could only assume they are seconds or irregulars. They are going back asap."
2,Nice if you like that vinyl feeling,"I'm not sure what's going on with these towels but even after washing them four or five times they still have that vinyl, slick feeling. They aren't very absorbant and rather uncomfortable as the towel smears the water around your body instead of drying you.Am I missing something?Maybe they were on sale because they were accidentally treated with Scotchguard or that silicon spray that hikers used to use on leaky canvas boots.I'm puzzled.Just ten bucks for two, though."
4,Great Value for soft fluffy towels,"I read some of the negative reviews for these towels but bought them anyway simply because the price was too good to pass up. I'm glad I did and feel compelled to give these towels a positive review! The towels came in shrink wrapped so the towels were a little squished when I got them but I didn't see any quality issues. They even had ""inspected by"" stickers. I washed them immediately and they came out of the dryer fluffy and very soft. Yes, there was some lint in the trap but not more than would be expected for a new towel. They're a big soft towel at a great price!"

These towels are not anywhere near the quality I expect from a manufacturer like Martex. I could only assume they are seconds or irregulars. They are going back asap."
5,"Soft, thick and absorbent.","The price for these towels was so low that for once I did not wait to read the reviews before ordering. Later, when I read the negative reviews, I felt the deepest pangs of buyer's remorse, especially, since the prospect of high return shipping cost loomed large over my head. Now that I have received the towels, I am so happy I did not read the negative reviews. Not too long ago, I ordered towels (from another site) listed at $120 per set discounted to $60 (how lucky) and the only thing good about them, when I actually received them, was the motif embroidered on top. (Of course, I promptly returned them, eating the outrageous shipping cost.) These towels are very plain to look at (pretty colors though) but in terms of qualities that matter, thickness, abosorbency, size, these towels are far superior to the overpriced fancy looking stuff meant only to look pretty on a towel rack. Best value for money."
3,Hope it's not hurting my battery!,"I like this item a lot, although I'm not completely sure it's not draining my cell phone battery.It's very helpful to have your phone easily available and visible rather than having to hunt for it a purse or pocket.If it's not hurting my phone, it's a very nice idea!"
5,Informative and Thought Provoking,I used this book to study during an NEH workshop. It causes you to think more about our basic humanity and the role that our government and we as individuals must play in democracy and in ensuring the basic human rights of every individual.
2,"Boring, densely written",I love history and political science but couldn't quite make my way through this one. Make sure you have the option of returning this one if you buy it.
1,horrible copy of a wonderful book,"This is a digital scan of Arendt's classic work using OCR technology. The text is jumbled and riddled with mistakes. The notes are interspersed with the text with no clear differentiation between the two. Chapters begin and end mid sentence. As a result, a difficult book is made nearly unreadable. I strongly suggest reading this book, but steer clear of the General Books edition."
2,The Microscopic Arendt,"First of all, my apologies to those who insist that reviews deal only with the content of the book under consideration. That said, my downgrading of Arendt's marvelous and cogent work is predicated on the microscopic printing in this edition, the Harcourt trade paperback. Arendt's writing is dense, but not near as dense as the printing. The publisher has crammed 45 lines of small print into a less than 7-1/2 inch page, with even tinier footnotes on most pages. I found it impossible to focus visually on narrow segments of text, a prerequisite for following Arendt's complex thought. So I wound up buying the Kindle edition, which lets me set font size to my comfort. I wanted to keep a hard copy, so I'm keeping the paperback, but I'll use it only infrequently."
2,Not much worth it,"""The Origins of Totalitarianism"" is in the best German tradition: turgid style,high-flown philosophising. The whole issue is presented in a roundabout way that makes it difficult to see what it is aiming at. I think there is a rambling quality to it that frustrates the reader's efforts to get the point or the general drift of the argument. Also, truths are delivered with an ex cathedra tone above ordinary explanations and analysis. As to the ""insights"", I think they are seriously flawed. For one thing, I don't think Stalin intended to conquer the world following the precepts of a guiding ideology. He was much more keen on keeping on to his throne in Russia, rather than risking everything (like Hitler) in a gigantic bet with history."
5,Valuable as historiography,"Largely discredited as an explanation for the origins of totalitarianism, this book remains invaluable for the scholar of the historiography of fear, coersion, and the Mass Man."
2,Interesting content but painful to read,"Given the scope and reputation of this book, it should have been an enthralling read.However I found the first section on Antisemitism very unclear and unstructured. Whilst an impressive array of historical opinions, analysis and facts are presented, they are all tied together in a very jumbled and verbose way.Midway through the second section on Imperialism, I surrendered and abandoned reading the book."
5,Ms. Thomson scores again,"This volume features six more cases from the deed box of Dr. Watson, famously deposited at Cox and Co. Bankers at Charing Cross. Finally revealed are previously unpublished adventures such as the Aluminium Crutch and the Disappearance of Cardinal Tosca.As always, Thomson's prose is so evocative of Doyle that you feel you are back in the gaslit streets of London following Holmes and Watson. Once again the game is afoot."
3,Freddy Frogface,"Ten-year-old Victor must deal with town bully, Freddy, who threatens to spoil everything when Victor gets a chance to preform in a circus talent show.This movie was mildly interesting because of the wild pranks that the main character arranged. The unique style animation was creative.My favorite character was the dog named Sausage. His cute, friendly personality stole the movie.This movie was somewhat entertaining, I'd watch it again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
1,Didnt even finish it,This movie is awful. We rented it thinking it could be cute. There were at least 3 cuss words within the first 10 minutes. Unacceptable in a children's movie...PG? It needs at LEAST a PG-13 rating for the amount of cussing it.
4,Just reread it after 50 years,"I read it in high school, and had forgotten the title; however I remembered it fondly. I found it in a list of historical novels and got a library copy to read. I still really liked it after all those years, particularly the part in Trebizond. I just ordered a copy for my sister who is going on a Black Sea cruise next month, calling in Trabzon (modern Trebizond). I hope she enjoys it!"
5,Wonderful Adventure!,This is an excellent story. It is historically accurate and will keep the reader's attention until the tale's conclusion.
2,Content ok - Presentation horrible,"For a book bearing ""Design"" in it's title - ""Excellence by design"" sports a horrible layout.Pages are massive walls of text with no strong indicators for headlines or summing points.Illustrations are small and without color - thus hindering understanding."
3,Good For Novice Oracle Application DBAs but be careful,"This book provides a good overview of the architecture and components or Oracle e-Business Suite. I would be very useful for novice Oracle Application DBAs. However, I have found that there are at least a couple of the finer points provided in this book that are misstated or just plain wrong. So don't assume everything you read in this book is 100% accurate."
3,Covers Oracle Apps basics,I was looking for more indepth information about Oracle apps. This book covers basic information.
3,Refresher for Experienced Oracle 11i Apps DBA,"I liked this book but it is more of a quick refresher to jog memory when I am working in an Oracle 11i Apps environment as an Oracle Apps DBA. I would only recommend it to experienced 11i Apps people because it assumes at least a basic knowledge of how Oracle 11i works. For that much said, I recommend the other two excellent Oracle 11i App DBA books for new Apps DBAs."
3,Good collection but so-so recordings,"In case you are seeking this to get a 'Best of', you probably should seek out 'Natural Selection' instead of this title since the Liberation remasters are far superior sonically to these version. The only exception is 'Throw Your Arms Around Me' which is the album version rather than a live version on 'Natural Selection'. Also of note is that if you're seeking a particular version of 'Talking to a Stranger' you should be aware that this is the A&M single version (3:52) that appeared on the 12"" EP of 'Talking to a Stranger' not the original version (7:30) of the recording on the White Label records or Liberation re-issues. This album also has different track listings depending on whether you get the Australian, IRS US, or IRS UK releases. Make sure you verify since one version omits 'Talking to a Stranger' entirely. See [...]for details."
4,Heaven-sent compliation disc to charm and villify,"A voice that is both gravelly and fragile is surely an Aussie trait, perhaps one stolen by Eddie Vedder (who doesn't mind the eodd H+C cover), Mark Seymours miraculous voice and the band's two decades of bloated optimism in a pub-rock mentality make this an Australian rock essential. A Holy Grail. From Throw YOur Arms to Run Run Run, Collected Works shows a strength in songwriting and unabased brashness at the guitar few acts can equal. 'Impressive' is as much an understatement as saying 'Throw Your Arms' is the best song here. Get it.Hunnas rock."
3,Not quite there,"It's funny how things come together. I bought this album for one song only: ""Throw Your Arms Around Me."" I'd never heard of Hunters and Collectors before and knew none of their other songs. After listening to this album I can understand why a little...the bulk of the songs are not all that memorable, although they aren't unlistenable and are often at least different from the norm. ""This Morning"" in particular stands out as a more ambitious effort. But all in all I'd be happy if the CD only had the one cut ""Throw Your Arms Around Me"" -- here the group seems to click in a way it can't manage on any other track. It's worth a buy for that song alone: it can get me weeping on a moment's notice. (hence my 3 starred rating) The CD usually leaves the player after that though."
1,gloMinerals gloBlush Spice Berry,"Received the gloMinerals gloBlush in Spice Berry very quickly, however the first time I used it, it just broke up into pieces once I touched it with my blush brush. Very brittle must be very old cant use it."
3,after class starts,"The book is good and easy to read. However, I paid $41 for it before class started while other students paid less than $10 after class started. Also, I thought I order the 3rd edition but I got the 2nd."
3,I expected more,"As a book on the artists behind techno, Sicko's work is quite good. It is packed with names, dates, albums, tunes, clubs, and so forth, as one would expect from a music journalist. But as a work on techno, the art, I found the book to have some glaring holes. He does not discuss the technology of techno, he does not discuss the techniques developed by techno artists, and he does not really explore the question of what really aesthetically distinguishes techno from other music forms (I would expect a chapter devoted to each subject). But this book did not set out to answer these questions, I don't think -- an indication perhaps that the critical thinking on techno is still in its infancy."
2,"I could care less about the Detroit ""post-disco"" scene.","one of my professors did a review of this book in a magazine that she works for, and after i told her i wanted to do a term paper on techno music, she gave me this book. She said how great and informative it was. So, I excitedly opened up the book when i got home and fell asleep after half an hour. This book was ridiculously boring. There was little or no mention of such highly important (at least in my opinion) aspects of techno like trance and digital hardcore, to name a few. However, if you would like to hear entirely too much information on artists like Was(Not Was) then buy this book. What a joke."
2,Techno?,"Is this a joke? Anyone in their right mind who spends enough time listening to electronica, would know that ""techno"" is its own genre of music in the electronic world. American techno music? Errr no...If you really want to understand what types of music exist in the electronic world, take yourself to a rave, club, or huge european massive event. Look on the net for info on dj's, email music producers such as Satoshi Tomie or Shinichi about what type of music they produce for the crowds, or by magazines like BPM, URB, etc...This book, and many others like it, depict what a pioneers view on the music is that has changed drastically over the years...."
2,Seller was Amazing,While the video was not all that great - I like reviewing cults and wanted to add this to my collection. I only wanted to review this to say that the seller was amazing. While I only had to wait a few days to receive the video- when it came it looked as though someone at the post office went postal on it with a baseball bat. It was completely in pieces and obviously not playable.I emailed the seller and right away received an email back telling me that they were very sorry and all I needed to do was provide the invoice number and they would send another out immediately. They did. Exceptional customer service!
1,The movie being talked about hear is not the same movie,"JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOVIE COVER SHOWN ABOVE, IT IS NOT HEAVEN'S GATE WITH KRIS KRISTOFFERSON. IT IS A MOVIE ABOUT A SUICIDE CULT IN CALIFORNIA."
2,Lacking Illustrations,"What made this classic great were the John Tenniel illustrations. Sadly this reprint is lacking all the illustrations. Many of the other reprint editions have all the sketches and the DSI edition has the complete page border art, which I call picture framing page illustrations."
3,Not What I Expected.,"As others stated, this story is in English. I don't know why it has a French subtitle - this version has the poems that the other free version does not so I would recommend this one. I read Alice In Wonderland and decided to read this after seeing Tim Burtin's version of the movie- this book was not what I expected, a let down of the sequel of Alice's journey."
5,Well worth the second read!,"Only a mathematician could create such a complex word out of nothing, for after all, what are numbers? They only represent real things, they of course are nothing, yet they mean so much to us that we react to them as if they are the real thing.Such is the world of Alice, in her second adventure in the world of representations - through the looking glass - or mirror as we say today - that is how Alice begins this round of fun - if you want to read this to your child, perfect, if you like to see them smile, and laugh, this book is just what you want, and if you enjoy having your mind stimulated on an adult level while you're at it, then you have the right book in your hands!Enjoy it withAlice's Adventures in WonderlandYou and your children wont go wrong! :)"
4,EXCELLENT!,"This is an excellent product, and I haven't had any problems with it--it's been 2 years now.The only scary thing is that it sometimes won't automatically turn on when you plug it in. You might have to reset it first."
2,Stopped working after a few uses,The flat iron seemed to automatically turn off while I was using it and I didn't notice until most of the heat was lost. It did not seem to be a power connection problem because the green light was still on. I had to constantly turn the iron off and back on again during use to get the iron to keep a steady temperature. I contacted the seller but unfortunately their store offers only 30 days return policy and I was a few days late in reporting the problem so my loss.
3,Not what I expected,"Although it is a good product, I did not find it worked on my hair as well as I expected."
2,Not really good quality,"Received the item in good condition. However, the item looks different from the picture shown. The quality is also not as good as what I would expected. Bad quality compared to the other Samsonite Bags that I have bought from the stores."
1,shoes,Size I always order was way to big. Sent it back and requested a smaller size.3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available.
4,Great Shoe,I would like to have been able to wear the shoe. It was too little and was not what I wanted. I would recommend it for other to try however
1,UNPROFESSIONAL,"Not only was I unsatisfied with the product (shoes too big) but to make matters worse, when I sent the shoes back to the ""only"" address listed on the packaging, the company would not accept the shoes back (I had never worn them). It cost me $48. dollars for the shoes and another $8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office. I will never buy clothing off the internet again."
5,soft spots Stephanie pump.,Bought this through amazon. Love this shoe . bought a taupe and a black pair. They have good arch support and can wear with dress or slacks..
4,softspots women's pumps,"very comfortable , a bit wide ,but soft leather and beautiful color -good for all day standing on your feet"
4,Great shoes!,"I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy!"
2,It was just O K,"I guess I expected a lot more from this book, the stories were just OK and not particularly that erotic...I seen better books on Black erotica you should search those out."
4,Dreamers,"I can not rate this item as it was a gift for someone else and I have not asked for an opinion. I can say that it was delivered in good condition and the delivery was not really fast, but acceptable."
5,Great Rails,The rails are high quality. Great chrome that matches other chromes on the truck. Easy installation and very sleek and sharp design. Highly recomended.
4,"From a standing start, this will get you publishing with FMP","Very well done. An excellent introduction to the web for experienced Filemaker users. The nicest thing is that it has parallel sections for CDML and its alternatives, like PHP. Great if you want to know which way to go. Does a good job of pointing out that even using CDML, you basically have to abandon everything about Filemaker except the data structures. Which makes you wonder why you'd use it at all, rather than, say, PHP and mySQL. Presumably, in v7, FMP will answer that question, or lose all their web programmers. (4th Dimension bigots like myself will tell you 4D is the better way to get on the web, but let's not start THAT fight.) The book is smaller - height and width, not page count - than a typical computer book, but the material is excellent. (I save five stars for the best of the best.)"
3,we found it on Amazon,"Here I was, searching for a crossword dictionary to replace one that drowned in the ND flood. The price was good (!), the size small enough to carry in the car when we travel and it was a paperback which travels better than a hardback. 2 down, one to go!!"
4,Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,I received the crossword puzzle dictionary much quicker than expected. It is in pretty good shape and exceptable. A couple of pages were torn but none were missing and all words can be read. I think for the price it was a great deal.
1,Not good,I have a 5th edition of this book which has more info in it than this one. I was very disappointed so I sent it back.
5,Andrew Swanfeldt - Better edition!,"Have had the 5th edition of this great reference book. I've used it frequently. It was tattered and torn, but still an old friend . The sixth edition has the same great lookup features, but with updated entries. I'm so glad I purchased it."
5,Crossword Dictionary,I have used an earlier edition of this for years. I think that it is the best Crossword dictionary published
2,Only 365 sentences,I read this book because it has the name of Hill. But only 365 sentences which are from Hills are good (even very short). The rest of the text is not helpful as hills writing. Try some other title with Hill.
5,Works great!,"I ordered this for a longboard that I and my boyfriend had built. Very reasonably priced, however, since I opted for free shipping it took a while for it to arrive. Boyfriend ultimately applied it to the board and so far shows no sign of flaking or peeling off, and he is pretty rough with his skateboards too. All in all, great product."
4,Business as Missions,"A good introduction to an evangelistic strategy that uses buisness to promote missions. For those who are new to the field of microcredit finance and kingdom business, this is an easy read that will provide a satisfactory overview."
4,Transformed my view of work!,"Most comprehensive and practical book I have read on this subject. Offers great insights and guidance for business owners and others who want to work overseas. But wait ... the biblical teaching on work takes thinking about work ANYWHERE to a MUCH higher level. A great resource for seeing work as ministry and using work skills and business to improve and transform our world. It addresses three basic sizes of business specifically, micro, medium, larger overseas private equity. There is also an appendix that gives added info on what the Bible says about work -- very interesting. If you can read only one book on business for transformation and ministry ... make this it!"
2,Conception Chronicles,"I got this book because I thought it would help me conceive after Birth Control. I read until the middle of the book and flat out gave up. I didn't appreciate how the women wrote like the whole process was pretty much a joke and right in the middle of it they start talking about infertility until almost the end of the book. I took their advice and dumped it for ""Taking Charge of your Fertility""."
5,Great!,"I loved this book. Reading it made me realize that I am not alone in the world of infertitilty. There are plenty of books available on this subject that are full of facts. ""The Conception Chronicles"" is very informative but the message is conveyed in a light manner that I was instantly drawn into and found very engaging."
5,You are not alone,"This book helps those going through difficulties in trying to conceive see that you are not alone, and you are not crazy! This is just a difficult and trying journey. The book helps readers to laugh at all the crazy things we think and do while dealing with obstacles in trying to conceive. But it also serves as a reminder that many people have a hard time trying to get pregnant and that there is hope out there."
2,Why Is Infertility Funny?,"This book and others like it are treating infertility as if it were something to joke about. I'll accept that a little humor is ok, but not an entire book that makes light of the situation. If you're serious about having a child, and are having difficulty, you need to know the facts, and the best way to get them is straight from an expert, not 2 or 3 journalists who think making light of their own unfortunate infertility issues is a good idea.My wife and I bought this book and several others. We liked ""What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant"" best. It covers all the relevant points about infertility and treatments, provides insight into how to improve your fertility, looks into the future for new technologies, and addresses surrogacy, sperm and egg donation, and communication with your future children about their conception.Do yourself a favor - if you want good solid advice get ""What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant"" instead."
1,Why Does This Stuff Get Published?,"What publishing executive woke up one day and decided every infertile woman (and man) wants a CHATTY, IRREVERENT, and TONGUE-IN-CHEEK guide that belittles men, drones on about insignificant details, and makes light of the infertility process?There seems to be a rash of books like this coming out on the market in the last two years. I'm afraid ""girlfriend guides"" are too much reality for me. I'm not one to read gossip rags, watch reality TV shows, or rubberneck every fender bender.I consider myself among those who have lots of girlfriends and not one of them would appreciate this type of book.My husband and I found a couple that we believe are more useful like the Couples Guide to In Vitro Fertilization and the newest one, What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant. Both of these comprehensive books are written in a genuine and compassionate way and can only help couples reach their end goal faster: conceiving a baby."
5,Great Book!,"I am so glad I bought this book! Trying to get pregnant has turned into such a serious and hard experience for me and this book has helped me to remember my sense of humor. There were some issues discussed in this book that I realated to so much, and they seem so intense as i experience them, but as I read about the authors stories it was absolutely hilarious! Like obsessing over the ovulation strips! If you're having a hard time conceiving you will definitely relate to this book and enjoy it!"
4,Great for a non-medical view!,"When my husband and I first started talking about trying, I wanted a book that was going to give me a more light-hearted view of the conception process. I was pleased when I found this book! I have read most of it now, and it's informative, but keeps me laughing. If you are looking for something that will help you analyze your fertility with steps and procedures and all that medical mumbo-jumbo, this is not the book for you! The only downfall is that the last third of the book is all about infertility treatments, and doesn't fit my interests at the moment."
2,Better off just reading the rules,"This is just the prof reading rules to you and very rarely giving examples on application of the rule to a hypo. Occasionally he gives tips on what are common MPRE questions, but nothing earth shattering (conflicts is a big part of the exam...shhhh don't tell!!). Plus, the rules have been revised a little bit since these tapes and they are no longer completely correct (example: the rule about permissive breaking of client confidences has changed).Even if a more recent set of tapes by this guy is available, I'd really think twice. He really doesn't give you any more insight into what's on the MPRE than the rules themselves and I don't think it's gonna help you much in a PR class unless you class is very very very basic and black letter oriented."
5,nurses on bataan fighting side by side with infantry,the little known story of about a dozen US nurses in a prison camp near Nagasaki... as told to the author by a number of those who suffered through the Bataan Death March and transportation to Nagasaki... They were in this camp 10 miles from the epicenter in Nagasaki when the A Bomb was dropped. Only 6 survived the entire ordeal.
5,TIGHT,"THIS IS SOME STRAIGHT UP GANGSTA ISH, IF YOU'RE INTO CHICANO RAP THEN GO GET THIS CD, OR IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEN CHECK OUT THIS CD."
2,Uneven out for brassy Bassey,"This compilation CD is all over the lot with some of Bassey's early outings, Fly Me To the Moon (1964), packaged with her later hits Don't Cry for Me Argentina (1978). The intent may have been to give the listener an example of Bassey's breadth, but what such a historical perspective does is allow one to hear how thin and uneven Bassey's pyrotechnic voice has become over the years. ""Argentina"" and Whitney Houston melodramatic ""Greatest Love of All"" are troublesome to hear. Missing from this retrospective are Bassey's Bond blockbusters. While her vocal prowess is suitable for such cinematic songs, it completely over dramatizes Cry Me A River, And I Love You So. Even the arranging on Look of Love and Can't Take My Eyes Off of You are over the top and unwieldy."
5,A bloody Rorschach representation of any modern industry.,"The more I read Balzac (well, three, so far, of his 95), the more I wonder if he isn't walking around modern Times Square, or Hollywood Boulevared, or the Magnificent Mile. So rarely are urban writers able to transcend the particular politics, technology, and norms of historical situations and leave you feeling as though you've pieced the story together yourself from a recent Sunday paper. Balzac always begins slowly, almost ponderously. But be patient, and see this method for what it is, a means of solidly rooting you within the very heartbeat of the story. The less you rush through Balzac's beginnigs, the bigger the payoff in the end."
3,Modern Library translation is weak vis-a-vis readabilty,I did NOT like the Modern Library translation as it does not flow well. Vis-a-vis Balzac (in general) I have prefered the Penguin & Oxford translations.
2,Very Misleading,"I read the first page of this book and decided that I would enjoy it. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. The first page was the only good page. Book sucked. I don't know what book the other reviewers were reading.Sorry...Try again"
2,Poor quality,"The print was so light, it required a magnifying glass to distinguish between C, G, O. The item sold for 19.68 plus 10 for shipping. The return policy was 10 minimum and with the shipping it wasn't worth returning. The company was aware of the light print, but felt that something was better than nothing. They also indicated that nothing else was available. That was not entirely accurate as I found a color coded print on line. I told them that I would not be returning the item and no action was required because I felt that it was not worth pursuing. They then refunded the full amount to my credit card. I kept the poor quality manual as I did not want some one else to get it. This was my first time dealing with them and it was not a good experience. I would not recomend them."
4,Not For Beginners!,"My company purchased this projector to be able to give PowerPoint presentations without having to connect to a PC or Laptop. This projector will work for that, but it isn't a projector for beginners. Multiple calls to Epson Tech Support were less than useless, they actually gave us really bad advice. Finally we got it up and running. The projector doesn't support all the animation options in PowerPoint but it does support the basic ones, like wipe, blinds, fly in, etc. Once we got the hang of the projector and we loaded all the software, ran the conversion and saved all to a memory stick, it ran fine and the display is very good. But unless you are a dedicated techy, my advice is find a simpler projector or connect a laptop."
5,One Of The Best!,"This is a book that should have never been taken out of print. It is a great guide for the young preacher in how to prepare and present his sermon. It is easy to read, has helpful suggestions, and offers many good tips for preaching the best sermons possible. PUT IT BACK INTO PRINT for the next generation."
5,Perfect book for your teen who doesn't like to read!,"Before I read this book my teen noticed it, flipped through it and started reading. In two days my teen had completed the book and wanted more. So whats the big deal? It was the first book my teen had ever read without it being forced reading for a school project!The book was passed on to a friend who passed it on to another friend.Thank you, Jeff Sherratt, for introducing my teen into the world of reading for pleasure. Please continue writting!"
3,Works as Advertised,"I thought I had an ingenious plan to order two step-up rings for my smaller lenses and only buy one circular polarization for my largest lens. It worked alright, but I can no longer use the lens hoods! It seems it was not so ingenious after all.Since I did not need to use CP filters all the time, I got this 55mm to 72mm for my Sony 35mm 1.8 andB+W 72mm XS-Pro Kaesemann Circular Polarizer with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating. Other than the fact that I cannot use the hood and the CP filter both at the same time, everything works great."
2,"cheaply made, out of tune","I bought this clock to replace one of similar design (also made by Seiko) that I bought 25 years or more ago. My old clock broke and could not be repaired as Seiko no longer makes the necessary parts. I loved everything about the old clock, from its appearance, to the chime with the adjustable volume and automatic night time silence. The new clock's description sounded like it would be the same clock, with only a slightly different face (less ornate). While I wasn't anxious to buy another Seiko, as broken Seiko products cannot be repaired anywhere but the one approved repair place in New Jersey, I didn't see anything I liked in the competing brands. So I bought this clock. It is a big disappointment. The materials are lower quality, which makes the appearance less appealing. The biggest annoyance, though, is that the chime tones are seriously flat, as well as ""tinny."""
4,Exciting music,"Robert Schumann was one of the less well known of the romanticists of classical music. Yet his music is quite impressive, and this CD includes some of his best overtures. The pieces range from 5 - 15 minutes in length, are all orchestral pieces, and are quite lively and melodic. The CD quality is good, and the orchestration is fine. For the price of this CD, it is a great buy and I recommend it."
5,Beautiful Pictures!,Definately a must have for any JB fan! The pictures and stories as truly wonderful!
1,Not Good at all,"I suppose, however, if what you want is a biased view on the other's religion then this is a good book for you. From a scholar's point of view it takes an exlusivist stance, chock full of misunderstandings and misinformation. In fact scholars don't even use the term ""cult"" since it is pejorative. The term ""New Religious movement"" (NRM), ""alternative religious movement"", or ""New religion"" are preferred. This book works to reinforce stereotypes present in society about NRMs. You would do better to check out anything by J. Gordon Melton who is considered the American expert on the subject."
1,Larson did no research whatsoever on different religions,Bob Larson is a fake and a phony. Anyone that buys what he is selling diserves to lose their money. He did zero research for this book. This book only fuels the nutters out there and someday will have a hand in some trailer trash pentecostal staking a bank manager because the demons in the ATM machine took his card.
3,BETTER USED FOR HOT DOGS THAN BACON,"PURCHASED TO REPLACE MY BACON KEEPER(WHICH SEEMS TO BE NO LONGER AVAILABLE)WHEN PLASTIC HINGES BEGAN TO TEAR. DESCRIPTION OF ITEM SAYS HOT DOGS OR BACON, BUT THE THICK BACON THAT I BUY WILL NOT LIE FLAT IN THE CONTAINER. SOME MEASURE OF FOLDING NEEDED TO FIT. DON'T KNOW IF REGULAR BACON FITS BETTER AND HAVE NO INTENTION TO FIND OUT. WILL USE IT FOR HOT DOGS, WHICH I THINK IS ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE ANYWAY. RUBBERMAID HAS A WIDE SELECTION OF CONTAINERS, I KNOW I CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL FILL THE BILL. THE EXPENSE NOT WORTH THE LIMITED USE. A TRIP TO WALMART, DOWN THE RUBBERMAID AISLE, IS MY NEXT STEP."
5,Late Masterpieces,"I've heard numerous versions of Dvorak's symphonic poems, but this one, the cheapest, is always the one that stands out. I have a deep affection for these late masterpieces, as you can sense Dvorak's delight in depicting the dark, fantastic world of Czech folklore. From the broad sweep of ""The Golden Spinning Wheel,"" to the palpable horror of ""The Noon Witch,"" all three pieces beautifully exploit the late Romantic orchestra and are unmistakably--but not typically--Dvorak. If you only know Dvorak from his last three symphonies, and the cello concerto, give these a try...it's an exciting new look at an all too familiar composer. This version, played with gusto by the brilliant Polish National Symphony, is simply the best. You have to give Naxos credit for going beyond the tried and true and unearthing some real gems. If you're looking to add these brilliant works to your collection, I would highly recommend this version (it's much cheaper than Jarvi's!) 5 stars."
5,Brings me back to my youth,"I love this book! I read it when I was a kid and wanted to be ""Iceberg Gordon."" Now I'm all grown up and reread it, it still is a great book. Definitely a good one for your younger teenage to read. I bought it for my 9 year old daughter and will give it to her in a year or two when she is ready for it. (Okay, I guess I really bought it for me...)"
5,Must-Read,"I had a very smart and very good teacher in grade school. We had to read a certain amount of books each year, and some we HAD to read as a class so we could discuss them. The Iceberg Hermit was one of them, and I have to say that it was one of my favorites of the must-read stories we had to pick from, right up there with Bridge to Terabithia, Tuck Everlasting, Mrs. Mike and Where the Red Fern Grows.I had lost my copy years ago, but thought of it again recently. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was still in print. I remember how my imagination soared, trying to picture the main character stranded in the middle of nowhere. I was transported to another place and time, and 20 years after reading the book, I can still remember it vividly. If you are looking for some good reading material for your children, this will NOT disappoint."
2,Slow and Boring,We did not care too much for this one. In fact we never even finished watching the entire movie.
4,feelings,this dvd goes more into the feelings and emotions of the characters not as carefree and relaxed as last dvd. as the show progresses the problem with human persocom relations is realized and often shunned. however its clear that hideki really does care about chi and this sets up for some major drama to follow
4,The best Chobits yet,This DVD was way better than the previous ones. If you are a Chobits fan this is an absolute must!
5,Very Exciting!,Vol. 5 is definitely full of suspense! After watching it I was crying because I knew that Vol. 6 wouldn't be out until January! I'm praying that it'll be out sooner but of course that's highly unlikely. For all Chobits fans.... you should definitely get this one because the story starts to tie in as it progresses! I know I enjoyed all 5 of the Vol. and would definitely get the 6th one when it comes out! GO CHI!!
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I grew up reading this story with my family at Christmas and have happily continued the tradition with my own family, first with my husband and now with my children. I recently posted a picture on Facebook of my family's first edition and my family was overjoyed that the book is still being read today. I went on google on a whim to see if anyone else had heard of this book. I was pleasantly surprised to see it republished. When my mother looked into it years ago she could not find any information on it. I am going to have to buy copies for all of them for their families. This book is on the top of my reading list every year!"
4,A Real Story,"Not to be mistaken with L. Frank Baum's book by the same title, the author was writing a much more accurate telling of how Saint Nicholas came to be. The book is well written and clean as a whistle (that is to say there's nothing offensive in it) so it can be enjoyed by children of all ages. I would gladly recommend this book to anyone who loves Christmas!"
5,"A warm, wonderful, heart-filling story.","All of the favorite Christmas traditions are here - the gifts, the stockings, the red suit, the reindeer, the trees, and the legend. This should be a part of every family's Christmas tradition. A New Hampshire gentleman by the name of Jim Barnes reads the story to local groups, and has released an audiotape of the story, in order to spread the word of this wonderful story. If you don't yet own this book, be sure to have it ready for next Christmas."
4,A delightful background to the legend,"This book describes the childhood, youth, and adulthood of Nicholas, who was to become known (after his death) as St. Nicholas or Santa Claus. This is a charming, old-fashioned story of real people with real concerns and lives. Nicholas himself is a bit TOO good (butter wouldn't melt in his mouth!) but is still a very kind, generous, and likeable man. The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus is written in a style that makes it accessible to young children without 'talking down' to adults. Needless to say, there is no violence, crime, sex, or any of the other bad things that are so prevalent in modern books - just the story of a little boy who is able to overcome loss of his family and grow into a good and generous man who loves children and becomes a legend in his own time (and after his death as well!). Highly recommended!Note on Kindle formatting: Nearly perfect."
5,Mommy,"I am a mother of two almost three kids. I grew up with this book. Every x-mas eve we could open one present (a pair of pj's). We'd grab a pillow and blanket and lay on the ground to listen to my dad read the whole book before we went to bed. I've had this book in my life for over 20yrs, and now I have children it is a must have, no question about have to have. I just wish it would go back in print. To know where Santa came from to know at one point he had a family. And why everything is the way it is, when my kids ask where holly comes from I know. It will be a holiday tradition for my family and hopefuly grandkids."
4,a great book!!,I thought this book was a great book.I think its a great book because of it helps explain how santa came to be.Ialso think its a good book because it helps to feed litle kids imanginations. I thought that giving toys away willingly was a generous thing to do. That's why I think The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus is a good book
1,100% Too Advanced for Everyday Athletes/Coaches,"If you're not a doctor or professional dietician, this book will be nearly unusable. It reads like a complicated medical journal, at best. This would be fine if it had offered general, practical information for those without a PhD, but it never did. Honestly, if you can understand this book well enough for it to be put into practice, you're likely smart enough to have written it yourself. I have never met an everyday athlete or coach who could have understood this book."
5,Thank you!,"As a nutritinal consultant who needed to learn more about sports nutrition, this book really did the job."
2,Not what I hoped,"Beginning of the book is good but I was looking for much more info about proteins, carbs, and fats. Did not get nearly as detailed in those areas as I hoped.Waste of money for me."
5,A well rounded film,"With all of the attention historical revolutions have been getting since the Egyptian uprising, I was inspired to see all the films made by the makers of Bringing Down a Dictator, which many Egyptians involved in the revolution watched. Not only does Orange revolution excellently document the power and effectiveness of non violent resistance, but it also gives the viewer a wonderful glimpse into the culture of Ukraine. Unlike many political documentaries that can come across as rather flat, Orange Revolution effectively captured these people's thirst for justice. This film looks at the revolution from many different angles and documents the resistance strategy step by step. I would highly recommend this film to any one interested in learning about civil resistance or simply the tenacity of the human spirit."
5,One of the best DVDs you'll ever see,This DVD shows people at their best lifting each others spirits and gathering for the common good. God Bless the Ukraine.
5,Survival Kids rock the house!,"WOW WOW and WOW! This game is awesome! I really like that there is night and day(unlike pokemon) also how you merge things: Stick + Rock = Baseball Set, Stick + Bark = Kindling to make fire(but not in rain), Flextree + Ivy = Bow, Metal + Stick = Ax,and Flextree + Fishing Tackle = fishing rodRight now, the monkey stole my backpack and I can't get it back. All in all this is a Great game!"
5,Survival Kids,"This is my favorite game out of all of the others I own. You play as either a boy or girl who gets stranded on a deserted island. You start off with only a pocket knife and you need to find food, water, shelter, etc in order to survive. With some objects you can create others, for example you can create a fishing pole to catch food. Anyway I love this game, I can play it for hours. I highly recommened, but it's a shame that they don't make it anymore."
1,"WOULD NOR BUY THIS ITEM, AND NOT FROM BARGAIN CELL","I purchased this item from Bargain Cell and it completely stopped working in less than five uses. When I called Bargain Cell Customer Service, they gave me the complete run-around and would not stand behind the product. All I wanted was a replacement which seemed fair to me, and I was even willing to send the lemon unit back to them at my expense. They refused to do anything for me, except suggest that I could purchase another one of these at full price. This was before the price was dropped to one cent and they were like $5 apiece plus shipping.I thought I was getting a bargain, but instead I got a LEMON. STAY AWAY!!! There are more reputable and responsive third party sellers out there. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BARGAIN CELL FOR ANY PRODUCT!"
3,"Tracks 3,10 and 11 are the only ones worth listening to.....",This CD was quite disappointing. The only reason that I gave it the three stars was because I liked those three songs and Beyonce did not even write one of them..... Get the single for the song you like - don't buy the whole album
3,got old,"The hits everyone loved. They get old, the other songs that weren't hits are boring. The good song is the gospel medley. I guess emotions too. But buy it if you don't get tired of pop easily."
3,Where has DC gone?,"Besides the obvious answer to that question, I mean where have they gone musically? What happened? Their last disc, The Writings on the Wall is, I admit, phenomenal, despite their so-called ""Male bashing"". This album has great uptempo songs such as :""ID 1"" & ""ID 2"", ""Survivor"", ""Sexy daddy"", and ""Bootylicious"". They've also got some great ballads, like my favorite, ""Dangerously in love"", and ""Brown eyes"", and of course the inspirational, ""Gospel Melody"". Where DC fails in opinion to most hardcore fans is that TRUE R&B sound we expect from Destiny's Child (Listen to their debut disc, you'll see what I mean). Otherwise, Beyonce is great writer/producer, and this cd is worth having apart of your collection, but the last one was better."
2,Ummm....,"I'm a Destiny's Child fan and everything, but to be honest, I just wasn't feeling ""Survior"". I'm the type of person who likes mostly hip-hop/rap/r&b...and even though D.C. is an R&b group..I just wasn't feeling it. It sounded too much like a Pop record. On tha real..I like the first ""original"" Destiny's Child, which LeToya and LaTavia in the group, better.The only song on this cd I like is ""Independent Women Pt2""..the others..I'm not feeling."
3,DC went kinda pop on this album!!!,"While I thought this album was good, I still think that Destiny's Child should have stuck with a more R&B sound on this record. Nevertheless, this album still has good songs like ""Indepent Woman Pt.II"", ""Dangerously In Love"" & ""Apple Pie 'Lemode."
4,Good pop Cd,"Well this is more pop then soul, like the previous one ""writings on the wall"" but this one has sold better and had more hit singles. The songs here are more catchy and tougher then before too even though the lyrics aren't so good on many songs like ""Independent Woman"" ""Nasty Girl"" and ""Bootylicious"" but all great pop song however. Another great one is ofcourse the title song ""Survivor"" overplayed on the radio but a good song. ""Emotions"" the cover of a BeeGees song is a great ballad so is ""Brown Eyes"", which i found it strange they never released. Commercially this is a better Cd then the previous one's, but not so much soul. Beyonce is sometimes oversinging, but that's part of it i guess."
4,European Version MUCH better!,"Hey, as a german citizan I bought this CD last year in german stores. Here the CD includes 18 songs, that means 3 extra songs (""Dance with me"", ""My heart still beats"" & ""Perfect man""). As a real Fan I would buy the Album in Europe (around 17$ + shipping). Well THIS should just be an friendly advice for the real Fans!"
4,"""Emotion"" should be outlawed","I enjoy far more of Destiny's Child's music than I would have expected -- ""Bootylicious"" and ""Independent Women"" are fun and catchy and ""I'm a Survivor"" runs around in your head after hearing it. But ""Emotion"" -- oh god, this song wasn't good the first time around, and this wimpy rendition sounds like Muzak (elevator music) with vocals. This may be an example of the radio stations/record companies deciding what's going to be a hit -- the radio starts playing the single on its release date, and then they play it, and play it, and play it.... is anybody actually requesting this song? Please, let it die a natural death!"
2,Where Has The R&B Gone ?,"their 2nd album was full of beautiful R&B, after SUPER HIT say my name Destiny's Child turn into POP group. from their start with Survivor. also I'm sick of their ""you stole my man,hey you boy i'm not gonna pay for your thing"" lyrics. until when they gonna writting about this noisy stuff. also what's up with this poor producing sounds from this album. SONY thinks beyonce's practice sound is good ? and in survivor she singing about topped world wihtout them,but the 2nd album made by ex-members, grammy was for the others,too. i want suggest that they need to change their names to Beyonce with backups or 2nd edition of Diana Ross and Supreme or Family Business.only good songs on this album is emotion & nasty girlif they still have ex-members Destiny's Child would be REAL new R&B group Sensation but they don't"
3,Can Survivor survive??,"I must say I was sorely disappointed by this third effort. . . my favorite song on the whole cd is ""Dangerously in Love,"" which showcases deep emotions that are only enhanced by the lush harmonies. . . I liked The Writing's on the Wall alot better as whole. . . Survivor isn't bad, it just lacks that little extra Ooomph that we all expect Destiny's Child to have."
2,TWO STARS,"I GIVE IT TWO STARS: 1 FOR INDEPENDENT WOMEN & 2 FOR SURVIVOR. ACCORDING TO ALL OF THE HYPE & ANTICIPATION THAT HAS BEEN GOING AROUND, THIS ALBUM REALLY DOESN'T LIVE UP TO IT'S NAME. IT'S NOT ALL THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE."
2,HORRIBLE,"I don't understand all the hype over Destiny's Child. This CD was not well put together and Michelle shouldn't be singing because she has no talent. I hate to write a bad review about this CD because I love Beyonce but the song's on this Cd are so stupid. While there may be a few good song's such as Survivor, Nasty girl, Brown eyes, and Dangerously in Love the quality of the other song's just brings the value of the CD down. If you do buy this CD you will be skipping around a lot. If you want a Destiny'd Child Cd that's worth your money I suggest you go get The Writing's On the Wall."
4,"If you have spare change, buy this CD!!!!","This album might be your favorite, or a CD you never wanna seeagain! When I first bought ""Survivor"", ... The past few days, I couldn't take it out my CD player( especially last night!)! I am crazy about "" Survivor"", ""Bootylicious"", ""Fancy"", and ""The Story of Beauty"", but I think ""Nasty Girl"" is totally NASTY! I'm not a fan of ""Independent Women Part 2"", songs # 14 and 15(they're not really songs to me), and ""Brown Eyes""."
2,Ok I pumped it up to 2 stars after hearing the entire CD,"Same songs, same keys, same vocal runs, same everything on all cuts, both albums. Can they sing a song in A flat minor? G or E?? Don't think so. What these ladies need is some real writers. Some bona fide producers who write real songs. This music is the typical junk that is looped, sampled and manufactured on several so called hit records that are on the program directors play-list! Plain boring is what it is. I gave them 2 stars because their in shape, and probably spend many hours in the gym, hair saloon and the nail shop. If their manager spent more time on the musical quality than what he spends on their image these ladies might be well deserving of all the hype. Let one of the other ladies sing lead PLEASE! Or please teach Beyonce some new vocal runs! One more album like the previous two and their musical career is done."
2,This album is uneven,"My friend played this album for me and I just can't get into it. Survivor is really about Beyonce be self-center and attacking the girls they throw out the group, not into the beat. Bootylicious really don't work with me. Just not my style. The other song on the album not that great."
3,Uneven,"The best songs on the album are Independent Women Part I (Part two sounds like a circus theme), Survivor, Bootylicious, Nasty Girl, and Emotion (which is a remake, better than the original). The rest ... maybe could've been good if it had been overhauled by a good producer (ie. not Beyonce). Don't get me wrong, some of the other tracks have potential, but they sound unfinished and amateurish. Overall, this CD is not really worth buying, since all of the good tracks are going to be overplayed on the radio anyway."
2,"Is Beyonce's middle name ""Diana Ross""?","As a songwriter, BK makes a great supermodel. But ""don't hate 'em because they're beautiful"" to paraphrase the old saying. Hate this album because it sounds like somebody's daddy let them into the studio to just do whatever yelling and hollering that they wanted. (Oh, isn't that just what happened?) Although the harmony is good, most of the songs are discordant and hard to listen to. And what is up with the ""borrowing"" of the intro music from Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen?"" Were the girls even born when that song came out? Oh, and we get that you girls love each other, which is very touching but gets old after the 500th time that we hear it. On a positive note, Independent Women Part I is a great song. And the girls do a great job on the old Bee Gees tune (and it is SO obvious that Emotions was written by someone else!)"
2,Just download,I am disappointed with the CD! How many times can you redo the old songs and recycle them into new songs? There are no varieties in this cd. I should have downloaded the songs and saved my money to buy Janet Jackson's new CD!
4,one of their best!!,"Destiny's child has had 3 albums put out but this one in my oppinioin was the best. Even though beyonce basically wrote all of the songs with other people and not the other 2 members of the group, the beats are still catchy. I took off 1 star on this album because i only heard Beyonce do most of the verses in the songs. Beyonce, let the other 2 that are in the group help out a little too!! They are really talented artists too you know. and even though you might be the lead singer give michelle or kelly a chance to do more of the verses. all of the songs were pretty good though except for ""sexy daddy"" and ""fancy"". those songs are OK but i know ya'll can do better DC. Oh and if u guys happen 2 read this, please think about getting back 2gether w/ latavia and latoya. they were really good artists 2."
3,This CD was OK.,I found the first 3 songs to be great. Independant woman Part 1 was great and lively. Survivor and Bootylicious were cool and lively and the beat was a new direction for the girls. But the fourth song to the last was just so repeated and some of the lyrics sounded uneducated. I like destiny's child and I am not trying to offend them but I personally liked their second cd (The Writings on the wall) better from the lyrics to the melodies.
3,"They can sing, but the songs are kinda of weak.","I like Destiny's Child. To me I listen to songs that have meaning. Their lyrics are childish. Even a eight years old can write that. The beats sound the same on every songs. Some of their songs doesn't make no sense like ""Sexy Daddy"". I give them **1/2."
5,ThE bEsT!,"If you dont have this CD then you better should! Its the best with good songs like ""Dangerously in love"" ""Brown Eyes"" ""Fancy"" and ""Bootyliscious"" make this CD one of my favorites. The only downfall on this album? Gospel melody and Outro. Yes of course its nice to say thank you but a songs gotta have a beat. Right? This is a CD is would recommend for anyone and it will keep playin' in my box for a long time!"
1,BAD!!!!!!,"I am a big fan of this group, however, I was disapointed when I heard the album. Beyonces voice gets annoying after a while. The songs are really bad. I only like th survivor song. I give it 2 thumbs down!!"
5,This cd is so awesome,"destiny's child is huge. i mean HUGE!! They're second cd was really amazing (i never listened to their first) and i was listening to my friends copy at his house and it is awesome. by far far far away theior best work yet!! my personal fav is happy face, i think survivor is cool too. i really wouldn't hesitate to buy this cd. i am going to as soon as i get my paws on some cash. you won't be dissapointed if you are a true blue destiny's child fan!! peace out:)"
2,Barf! This won't be surviving in my CD player!,"Let's see here, after the halfway descent Writing On The Wall this is a complete and total disaster. While the songs on the last CD were not too bad this CD one the other hand is a pathetic follow up to it.It's the childish, amatuerish, gender bashing music that makes me hate most modern R&B music these days. I literraly am wondering if this juvenilia songwriting that coulve come from an 8 year old was written by some 20something year old because it's literrally unintelligent childish drivel.The title track and Independent Women were good songs but have now completely worn out their welcome and are deeply annoying to my ears.DC had better grow up and put some emotion and soul into their music and improve their songwriting if they want to be considered real singers and musicians because with musical mush like this they will literrally fade from the limelight.Not recommended at all. Go and buy Alicia Keys Songs In A Minor CD instead."
4,Step Back For A While Beyoncé !,"Out of all the girl groups of today's mainstream, my first choice is Destiny's child for obvious reasons. ""Survivor"" is their latest offering since 1999's TWOTW. The tracks on here, are pretty suitable but Beyoncé seems to take way too much control on this album, listen to Survivor and Independent Women to understand what I mean. Even though I love her voice, I feel that Michelle & Kelly deserve the spotlight once in a while. Songs that I think are absolutely great are: ""Survivor"" an ode to somebody who just broke it off with another person, ""Bootylicious"" an ultimate club song, ""Nasty Girl"" even though I think it is downright hypocritical, ""Emotion"" a soulful rendition of the BG's hit. You owe it to yourself to pick up this cd, but don't expect it to hold the torch to their previous effort."
2,Were better in the past..,"I gave this album two stars for the simple reason that there were only three songs on this album that I liked and those happen to be the popular songs such as Independent Women Part 1, Survivor, and Bootylicious. The rest of the album were tracks that I just couldn't get myself to love. I would suggest that maybe if you like one of those songs on there, maybe you should look for the single instead. I just don't see spending the money on this CD when there is so much better.Try The Writing's On The Wall, that was a work of Destiny's Child that was so much better than this."
3,Okay CD,"I thought this was a pretty good CD. I liked their 2nd one much more. I felt this CD contained a lot of slow songs, while their 2nd album contained more upbeat songs. I think this is a great CD for Destiny's Child's fans."
2,"I""M SO TIRED OF THESE CHICKS!!!!","This CD was awful...a complete waste of time! Beyonce's writing skills are not all that. There is only one good song on this entire CD that was worth the listen and that was Track 12, ""Dangerously In Love"". The re-make of ""Emotion"" wasn't bad but all that other garbage was awful.....It's too bad, too cause the first two Destiny's Child CD's were really worth a listen to."
5,Grows on you,"I first reviewed this CD and gave it a 3. Now almost a month later i am giving it a 5! why is that? ill tell you why, this cd totally grows on you! I love ""HAPPY FACE"" ""BOOTYLICIOUS"", The ""GOSPEL MEDLEY"" and others. Actually I like every song on the album but it did take some getting used to. Although I still don't like the fact that Kelly and Michelle do not write or produce anything except the last track on the album, this album really is good. Give it a chance!"
4,Beyonace Nem,"Well the CD was alright, but not better then the others, some of the songs were wack, but, over all it was tight. The songs had a great meaning, and beat. Suvior, is one of the songs, i liked the most, it was encouraging, and helpful, it let's you know you can suvior, without anything(man). I think Michelle needs to lead more songs not just Beyonace, maybe Kelly. The Group should be called Beyonace and Them,(just kidding) she leads all the songs, when she is not the only one with a great voice. Overall I loved the Group, keep it real love Nanatezzi for Shezzi. Great things would come in the future..."
2,2 stars for 2 decent songs,"I just have one suggestion... Save the amateur songwriting and producing for BEYONCE'S SOLO album! Whose idea was it to allow Beyonce to produce and write nearly every song on the CD? What's wrong with COLLABORATING with other established/successful producers and songwriters? After all, this was supposed to be Destiny's Child's album, a group effort. Instead the songs sound as though they belong on a soloist's debut album. Surely not the type of material you would hope for on a 3rd release. The only 2 decent songs are Emotions and Dangerously in Love. I'll look forward to Kelly and Michelle's solo efforts because I've heard enough of Beyonce on this album alone!"
2,Destiny's Child Fooled Me!,"I bought this album because I thought that it would be different and better, but the truth is: Destiny's best effort was ""The Writing's On The Wall."" The title track, ""Survivor"" had me so hyped up. I thought the rest of the album would be just as good. Boy, was I wrong. I am so disappointed. I waited for this album for months. Don't get me wrong, this CD does have it's strong points in ""Independent Women"", ""Survivor"", and ""Bootylicious"", but the rest of the album is a waste of money and of talent. I hope their next album is better, and worth all that hype! Maybe they should title their next project: ""Better Than Before!"""
1,DIASTER!,"[....] Beyonce's Children,oops,I mean Destiny'sChild's new effort is terrible.[....]Beyonce's voice is annoying andKelly and Michelle are really her background singers.Beyonceis a bad songwriter and her lyrics are corny and quirky notstrong and the fake syncopated beats get tiresome.The only half-decent songs on this totally uneven album is their remake of""Emotion"",""Nasty Girl""[which again suffers from dumb lyrics],and ""Dangerously In Love""[based only on a good chrous].SURVIVORjust shows that Destiny's Child really has a different name and it's BEYONCE!"
4,"Good, but not better than TWOTW","This was a great cd. It was their first after 2 lineup changes. It opens with the anthem ""Independent Woman Pt. 1"", then goes into the unrelenting ""Survivor."" The sexy ""Bootylicious"" and the virtuous (albeit hyprocritically)""Nasty Girl."" These are 4 of the best cuts on the album. By track #6, it gets a little less stellar, but by #10, ""Emotion"" (the best collective vocal performance on the cd) brings the heat. As a nod to their spirituality, the do a gospel medley ending with a lackluster rendition of Richard Smallwood's ""Total Praise."" I enjoyed this cd, but if you want the definitive Destiny's Child, pick up the writing's on the wall. Also check out their solo albums, because they're worth a listen, especially Beyonce's."
4,destiny's child rocks,"i really enjoy listening to destiny's child. they have come soo far, to be where they are right now. like I love their songs. they are so totally easy to agree with and so totally easy to understand also. I absolutely love the way they work so hard, to do what they want, and to sing like they do, I mean com'n, who wouldn't want a voice like that? they are wonderful singers, and I will listen to their songs all the time. They are so totally cool. like i mean, they're really pretty too. They're just awesome!!!!!"
5,An awesome CD by DC-3!,"This probably one of my favorite CD'S by Destiny's Child. Their song ""Survivor"" is a wonderful song and so is ""Bootylicious"". ""Survivor"" is about one of the girls who left the band and how they need to continue on without her. I also like both parts of ""Independent Women"" which is also featured in the movie Charlie's Angels. Although I don't really listen to all of the songs on here, it's still an awesome CD by these girls. So if you really like their song ""Survivor"", then you should go out and buy this cd!"
4,A great comeback!,"I was totally blown away by 'Survivor'. The CD is great - the songs have great heart with great lyrics that make these songs just wonderful. When I heard the 'Independent Women Part I', my immediate response was ""Oh no, they are the girl enforcement people"". But now I have come to realize that the whole CD isn't about the first song! Survivor, although played out, stlil stands as one of their best songs! 'Bootylicious' is a great dance track, as is 'Sexy Daddy'. But they still have their spiritual side as is evidenced in the Gospel Medley - which includes the well-known Kirk Franklin hit 'Now Behold the Lamb'.All in all, this is a great CD. Somewhat lacking, but great!"
2,I expected better,"I really like DC's music and their last album was off the hook! but i'm quite dissapointed with this one. I might have gone off them becuse of the reasons i heard for the line up change but their music was still good. This album probably has about 3 songs that I like. When they started out they where r n b and now they've gone completely pop! I think that maybe they have been a bit over exposed at the moment and they need to take some time aout while they are doing their solo stuff. I Really like brown eyes, survivor, emotions and indipendent women but i'm afraid that's it really. With the last allbum you could listen all the way through and love everything but i think they have taken a bit of a turn for the worst. I do hope that with their solo stuff they are really successful especialy Kelly and Michelle becuse I think it's about time they had the spotlight."
2,Just Ok...,"This cd was not one of my favorites. first of all, all of the songs sounded too much like the last. Also, all of the songs were really choppy and didn't have a rythem. i just think that with the great voices those girls have, they could come up with a much better cd. i wouldn't recomend that u buy this cd cus u will be disapointed."
3,not as good as it could be...,"Ok, Ok, this album is decent as backround or party music, but other than that, its little more than a good effort by beyonce to write and produce an album. Sure, Beyonce gets most of the airtime, but unlike their last album, the other girls get their time in the sun as well, and its kind of refreshing to hear them as well. All in all, most of the songs lack any kind of focus, less because of the beats or music itself, but because the writing is not particularly strong. Ok, so its a better album than I could put together, but defenitely not as good as it could be. Come back in a few years, Beyonce..."
3,Decent Effort,"This album gets off to a strong vibe with the first five tracks. Unfortunateley, this is not sustained. Tracks 6-9 are downright HORRIBLE. ""Apple Pie A La Mode"" is the girls at their absoloute worst. And the next three are no better. The album gets back on track at the end, but it's still not enough to forgive tracks 6-9. Don't get me wrong, this ain't a bad album. There is strong harmonizing and the songwriting is decent. But this lineup of Destiny's Child is not the best.I wish they would bring back LeTavia and LeToya."
1,Survivor- NOT!,"They gave Beyonce too much creative freedom, on this one. This album lacks the same powerhouse tracks the second album had. It's corny, I also found in the songs like ""Suvivor"" and ""Fancy"" that they are being really petty by taking [...] shots at their former members. I eventually gave it to my daughter who hardly even listens to it.I know you guys are young, but GROW UP already!!"
2,thank goodness...,"...i cancelled my pre-order on this Survivor is the worst song I've heard in my life. incoherent babble I give it 2 stars because of Beyonces big rump the other two backup dancers are hurtin' and can't sing a lick I'll look for this in the dollar bin soon other than that it is ""Destiny Childish"""
2,They've gone pop... and gone BUST,"Destiny's Child was never really a credible, promising musical act. They aren't really talented and bring nothing new to the table. Such opinion is even more set in stone on their much-anticipated third CD, ""Survivor."" It's funny how they call themselves survivors and still have the need to diss on the former DC members who got booted out, LaTavia and LeToya. Why not move on? The ""music"" on here is very disappointing... no songs are downright, blatantly horrible, but sit down and listen to the CD and you won't find a single gem. The aptly-titled ""Emotion"" is a mediocre, will-do ballad at best... nothing spectacular, but sweeping and kinda catchy. As far as pop-dance with a little R&B thrown in, you get plenty. The lead single ""Survivor"" has a bouncy, addictive chorus. That's it. No songs will stick in your head the way a pop album should. If you want this kind of stuff only different and BETTER, go with Pink or TLC. Destiny's Child has no destiny."
1,Make it stop!,Their performance during the 2001 NBA Finals made it clear that this act makes up for a lack of talent and creativity with skin and hype. I'll pass.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!,"THIS CD SHOULD BE MORE THEN 5 STARS!!!!!! All I can say is, get the CD!!!!!!!!!! If you love Distinys Child then, you will love this CD!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
1,PASS THE MIKE CAUSE . . ..................,"please pass the mike to someone else, cause you are not making it happen with your played out songs. all the songs sound the same and yall nedd some help. i heard you on the radio yesterday talking about ""dont believe everything that you hear about destiny's child"". I dont have to hear nobody else say anything, i can listen to your whack cd for myself. fame has definetly gone to yall head. i started not listening to your music after yall kicked the first 2 members out. I hope that they come out and blow every body away. its called karma baby!!!basically yall are sorry and someone needs to let you know. this album soundewd like you wrote it while you were on the toliet. it needs ome serious intervention. yall aint even tru to the hood anymore. i bought your 1st and 2nd album, and now the 3rd which will unfortunately be the last. get a job your good at!!!! peace"
1,"I was sad that I didn't like this, but now I'm glad","I thought I liked R&B, but I don't. It was a bit of a disappointment for me when I discovered the real truth about myself, but in some ways I'm glad I stopped listening to this music because my mother was not really in favor of me listening to this. Weird though this may sound, my mother seems to want me to like her music (classical music and popular music from the 1950s and '60s). And if I don't listen to her music, she's gonna be mad. So my decision not to listen to this music was better for her."
1,Just Down Right Bootylicious!!!!!!!!,I cant see why everyone keeps dissin this cd - i think it is wicked!!!!! There are some phat tunes with heavy lyrics that range from fun & partyish right through to deep and meaningful! I think it deserves a huge round of applause for the Bootylicious ladies! Keep dropping the hits!!!! Well done!
5,I'm a survior........,I hate this CD!! Noooooooooooot!! I love it!! It was the 2nd DC CD I got!! I looooooooooooooooooooove DC!!
1,More pretty MTV fodder,"Destiny's Child, or, as they are known by some wags, TLC Without The Rapper or Beyonce And The Other Two, are the latest styled-to-within-a-inch-of-their-lives girl group to dominate the MTV airwaves. They can all sing, occasionally even well, but the songs are recycled riffs with throwaway lyrics that you'll forget within two seconds of hearing them. The Bee Gees, though, will be delighted that DC's cover of ""Emotion"" will net them a few more millions (it's supposedly going to be the third single). However, why Beyonce Knowles' father/manager persists in furthering the falsehood that DC is a democracy is bewildering at best and laughable at worst. Just let her go solo already--it can't be any worse than this pseudo R&B stuff she does now ..."
2,TERRIBLE Lyrics! A Waste of Money!,"I'm so upset that I wasted money on this. This CD is terrible. I gave it two stars because I like Dangerously In Love and Bootylicious. Everything else is pretty terrible. Beyonce wrote most of the lyrics, and while she has an amazing voice, she is terrible at writing. Borrow a friend's first! I wish that I did!"
1,Christian Booty,"Well let's see, DC is at again huh! DC says that they are SURVIVORS, but I don't get it! What the hell are they surviving from. Poverty, lack of money, no food or shelter, no job! Obviously not, so will someone please tell me why they call themselves survivors. ""I'm not going to compromise my Christianity"" Bootylicious has done it for you! Since Beyonce has the most parts on the Cd, I guess that's a sign of her going solo if not is should be. MTV please don't do another interview with them until Beyonce goes to speech school, I mean since she does most of the talking. It's so embarrassing to hear her talk! Hey did DC ever graduate from high school? That's a damn good question! You never hear anyone talk about their education. But how could you when you don't have any!"
1,DIANA (OOPS) I MEAN BEYONCE.,"I am not to fond of the new and un-improved DC-3, but I do appreciate good music. The Writings on the Wall was filled with nice ballads and nice dance tracks, but this new ""Survivor"" album lacks both. Basically these girls made an album, so every song could end up on TRL, I am wondering did Diana (oops) I mean Beyonce, put any thought into the songs she produced. OHH I forgot she produced EVERY LAST SONG. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with having a video on TRL, but can there be one non-bubblegum pop song on the CD."
1,Destiny's Doom,Beyonce should take up fingerpainting so that she will not be able to pick up a pen and write anymore songs.
3,BEYONCE'S CHILD!,"WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT?? I WAS ALITTLE DISSAPOINTED, WHEN I HEARD THERE ALBUM.SLOPPY PRODUCING, AND TERRIBLE WRITING, IS MY REASON FOR GIVING IT 3 STARS. BEYONCE SHOULD OF HAD MORE EXPERIENCED WRITERS HELP HER WITH THE ALBUM, (DIANE WARREN, RODNEY JERKINS).ANOTHER THING, IS It JUST ME OR DOES IT SEEM AS IF MICHELLE GETS ALL THE CRAPPY PARTS, BEYONCE AND KELLY GET THE GOOD SINGING PARTS, AND MICHELLE IS LEFT WITH THE LEFTOVERS.DONT GET ME WRONG! THERE ARE SOME GOOD TRACKS SUCH AS, SURVIVOR, EMOTION, AND DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE.THEY COULD OF DONE WITHOUT TERRIBLE TRACKS LIKE, HAPPY FACE, AND THANK YOU.I ONLY RECOMENED THIS ALBUM IF YOUR A BIG BEYONCES CHILD! FAN"
3,Average Album,"This one is definitely the weakest of the three DC albums. It has its moments like ""Bootylicious"" (the remix is better though), Apple Pie A La Mode (sounds like something out of the Prince playbook) and Emotions. The rest is average."
3,not original,"i have to say that this album is more upbeat and gets you going than the writing's on the wall. though writing's on the wall album is more original, u feel it more.i have to admit that beyonce is a great songwriter and producer. each song on the album had a different sound to it. if u don't particularly like rnb but u like destinys child, i suggest u listen to this album.My suggestion is that beyonce should give kelli and michelle a chance to release their own ideas when leading vocals, writing/recording/producing. That way all of them shares the same level of respect, rewards, pressure, recognition, power and most importantly a group as a whole.The downside of this (to beyonce) is that beyonce's power and respect will be on the same level as that of kelli's & michelle.otherwise the album is average to me."
4,An entertaining vocal display,"""Survivor"" is a showcase of the excellent vocal talent of Destiny's Child lead singer Beyoncé Knowles and additional singers, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland. The songs, although realtively limited in significant meaning, are fun and entertaining to listen to. The CD, a rare find, is packed with consistent tracks that are nearly all enjoyable to listen to."
2,Not Destiny's Child's best effort,I am glad that I traded old CDs for this one at the music store. I would be upset if I had actually paid for it. Most of the songs are just a stream of consciousness babbling by Beyonce. I think that Destiny's Child didn't take enough time to really craft this album into what it could be. They just threw this CD out onto the market in order to capitalize on their popularity from the last album. I am disappointed. And the idea of making little comments in between songs was taken directly from TLC's last album. These young ladies are talented enough that they could have done better.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I FOR ONE AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS GARBAGE THEY JUST THREW OUT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EQUAL OR GREATER TO THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL. BUT I COULD NOT GET INTO ANY SONG, ACCEPT SURVIVOR AND INDEPNEDANT WOMAN PART I. THOSE ARE THE ONLY SONGS AND I'M TIRED OF THEM. BUT IT DIDN'T CATCH MY ATTENTION LIKE WHEN I FIRST LISTEND TO THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL. AND BEYONCE JUST TAKES OVER THE WHOLE CD ARE THE OTHER GILRS JUST BACKGROUND SINGERS? MAYBE THEY NEED THE OTHER GIRLS BACK. THE ORIGINAL DC OR MAYBE THEY SHOULD LET SOME ONE ELSE PRODUCE IT OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW IM JUST NOT FEELING THIS ONE. IT IS NOTHING LIKE I EXPECTED AND ANTICIPATED. SO TRY AGAIN DC. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. I GAVE 2 STARS FOR THE 2 SONGS I LIKE. I'M OUT!"
1,Writing's on the Wall is much better.,"This is the worst Destiny's Child album of all of them. It takes on more of a pop direction instead of R&B.; Don't get me wrong, I enjoy pop, but not this. The only songs on the album I liked are Independent Women (Part I), Emotions (Although Beyonce oversings on this one WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much), and the Gospel Medley. Also, the richness and sharpness of the harmonies that were very noticable with the original Destiny's Child lineup, are missing. I must say though, Kelly sounds great on this album.This album just doesn't do it for me. If you want to hear Destiny's Child at their best, go pick up The Writing's on the Wall. Destiny Fulfilled is also much better than Survivor."
1,*sigh* not even napster worthy....,"i thought i'd bought the new destiny's child album. yet when i listened to the cd, i realized it was ""the writing's on the wall"" all over again. the songs on DC's second album all sounded the same, but i was willing to overlook that because the tracks sounded good (at the time) and had some nice bass lines and beats. this time around however, the sound is STILL repetitive, and the ""girl anthems"" are beaten to death. beyonce', meanwhile, seems to have come down with a case of ""dianaross"" syndrome, oversinging throughout much of the album and drowning out her two fellow members. it makes me wonder if kelly and michelle were actually ever in the studio, because i sure as hell can't hear a word they're singing!"
4,Could have been better...,"This CD had SO much potential. Following this Marvelous WOTW album Destiny's Child had to bring their best. What we got was a more pop influenced CD but its still good. The songs lose momentum when you get past the first couple of songs. Independent Woman part 2, Happy Face, and Sexy Daddy are not working for me. I think a Missy produced joint would have been hot and maybe some more mid tempo R&B; cuts would have made this CD fantastic.While the Cd isn't worth 1 star it just wasn't what fans were expecting. Vocals are nice.. needed two more songs to keep Cd at 16 tracks.Independent Woman, Bootylicious, Emotion,Brown Eyes, and Dangerously in love are favorites."
2,Overwhelmed,"When I first heard this CD on May 1st, I cried. It just moved me that much. I couldn't believe that I had wasted my 10 dollars at Best Buy on that mess. I give it two stars because there are a couple of standout tracks, but Beyonce's sense of beat is muddled, her writing style is juvenile, and the CD lacks creativity. However, if you're a Beyonce ""groupie,"" you'll love it because she dominates every single song. Don't believe the hype about everyone singing lead. A verse here and a verse there does not equate singing lead in my book."
1,Terrible..........,"I just bought the Live In Atlanta DVD and both me and my friend agreed that this was the worse album they have put out. It's to pop and I agree with All Star, I like pop but not like this *confused*. It's pretty safe to say TWOTW was their best album!Even Destiny's Fullfilled was better than this and that had all slow songs. I don't know what else to say other than this album just has singles on it. They are not consistent at all, and the album is just to damn choppy for me.So, in other word it's horrible. Buy their first CD, TWOTW and Destiny's Fullfilled instead. Even the XMAS CD.Peace, Kmecc"
5,DC-3 ROCKS! GO GIRLS,I think this CD is definetly a step up for Destiny's Child. they are a great group and such an inspiration to younger people. They've gone through trials and tribulations as a group but they come back on top to be the best group ever! They've definetly proved that they deserve to be in the music buisness.
4,Good but it could use some improvements,"Beyonce is still the lead singer but this time but Kelly and Michelle have more solos this time. It has a couple great songs however for other songs, there's something I can't put my finger on but parts of songs are confused. They do a good cover of Bee Gees's ""Emotion."" ""Bootylicious"" is silly but it's fun. ""Outro (DC-3) Thank You"" the girls sing about how much they appreciate each other. ""The Story Of Beauty"" is a decent song but it might help some of their younger fans who have gone through abuse. ""Independent Woman Part 2"" is much better than the first one. The cd also includes the hits ""Survivor"" and ""Independent Woman"" (which was included on the Charlie's Angels soundtrack) and a cd extra if you put the disc in your computer. I liked the Writing's On The Wall better than this cd. This cd will probably make r&b purists cringe but for a generation that grew up with MTV and loved the first one, they will probably find some enjoyment from this disc."
4,Not as good as,"This CD is pretty good, but I kinda think Destiny's Child ""sold out."" They used to be R&B, but now they are bubblegum pop. Letting Beyonce produce every song was a big mistake! All of the songs sound alike! They could of had another producer on a couple of songs at least. Destiny's Child are hypocrites. In the song ""Survivor,"" they say that they are not going to dis the ex-members, but the whole song is a dis! And in ""Nasty Girl,"" they say, ""Don't walk out your house without your clothes on."" Well they wear a lot of revealing clothes, so they shouldn't be talking. If you look past the hypocritical lyrics and repetitive beats, ""Survivor"" is a good album. I enjoyed ""Bootylicious,"" ""Independent Women Part 1,"" ""Apple Pie a la Mode,"" ""Sexy Daddy,"" ""Fancy,"" and ""Emotion."" Basically songs 1-10 are good. 11-15 is all ""filler."""
2,"""Writings On The Wall"" Was Better.... Much Better","Perhaps you just have to be able to fully relate to the music of Destiny's Child. Because if you thought their last album was full of too many ""bling-bling"", ...songs; then you won't find any comfort in 'Survivor'. It seems to be a trend that artists sometimes can put out anything and it just turns platinum without the artist every really seeming to care about the material. Let's hope that this was just a fluke and that Destiny's Child couldn't find any good material this time around. Because if that's not the case, then Billboard Music and Grammy Awards will be but a distance memory."
4,WHY SO POP?,"i have to say that dc are the best band in my opinion (although ""band""= beyonce) and i have all their albums.now, don't get me wrong, this album is GREAT,then why 4 stars? well, if you have the other 3 albums you'll know that dc have a better r'n'b sound than pop, and here in this album pop takes over! in my opinion ""the writing's on the wall"" and the-just-got-released ""8 days of x-mas"" are better. but still,a very good album and there's plenty of great songs.recommended for pop/r'n'b lovers and dc fans."
3,"Okay, I Guess","I bought this Cd because, I love the song Bootylicious. Since Kelly was singing the song, I figured EVERYONE in the group would since but as I listened to Nasty Girl and others Beyonce is a center-holic, if she's not singing lead she'll die. but overall the Cd is fine with me everyone does get there chance to sing but I wish they could sing more. I can't wait for their solo cd's so I can FINAILLY hear Kelly and Michelle."
4,DC is awesome,This cd has a lively and diverse mix of music on it. I highly recommend it. In my opinion it is the best cd from Destiny's Child so far!
3,Not as good as anticipated,"survivor didnt live up to my expectations which i guess must have been pretty high since everyone seems to really like the new album. after listening to it over and over again i kinda like some of the songs. the beats are amazing but the tunes are a bit irritating. songs like 'nasty' and 'fancy' really make you want to switch ur system off, but they have some really nice tracks like 'apple pie a la mode', 'dance with me' and 'my heart still beats'. i'd say, not all that bad."
2,YIKES!,"I am still shocked by how awful this album is. Believe me, it is nothing like ""The Writing's on the Wall."" The only tracks I like are 1, 2, and 3 (but 3 isn't that great). I could have waited a little longer for them to really get this album together. It seems like they like putting out albums one right after another though, which is a shame. Hopefully, if they continue on this bad album->wonderful album->bad album trend, the next one will be a keeper."
2,Only one good song..,"We all know Survivor is a popular song, but the rest of the album is worthless. Hold on to your money for the Survivor CD Single."
5,A survivin' trio!!,"DC's third effort is super! These talented ladies have definitely matured. You will love these new tunes, from up-beat ones, to slower, meaningful ones. You will NOT be disappointed by this cd. I highly recommended to everybody. A must have to your collection!"
3,its okay,well like alot of people on tuesday i rushed to go get this cd. let me just say that its not as good as writings on the wall but it will pass. but like writings on the wall they still are going with the same tired lyrics. when will they grow up and talk about real life issues! i love nasty girl and emotions and surrivor is okay but im still trying to figure out what are they surriving? well im still going to back my girls because they are from houston!!!!!!!!
4,An inspirational album,This is an album unlike any other. It covers every emotion from heartache to happiness and it is nice to listen to music that recognises independent women all the hard-working women
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH DESTINYS CHILD BECUASE THERE CD IS NOT WORTH SPENING 15 DOLLARS ON. THERE IS OLNY 3 SONGS THAT HAD ME INTRESTED. THEY REALY DID GO DOWN HILL THERE LAST CD WAS A LOT BETTER AND NOBODY SHOULD MISS OUT ON THE LAST ONE ""WRITINGS ON THE WALL"" BUT I'M TELLING U, U ARINT MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING BELIVE ME PASS ON IT."
2,i am really sorry i bought this album!,"I thought it was going to be as good as ""writings.."" but it certainly was a dissapointment i liked the fact that the other two members actually sang on this album but beyonce is written all over it and my god her attempt at writing is plain ridiculous and a pain to listen to.This album is just another foolish pop album indisguise of an RnB facet!"
3,"Not a Review, So Much As A Correction:","I came across these reviews as I was trying to research who wrote the song, ""Emotion.""The Bee Gees DID write it, as many have stated.However, they did NOT write it FOR Destiny's Child. They wrote it in the late 70's for Samantha Sang, who made it a top 10 hit. And, in the original version, the Bee Gees sang backup.I rate the album as a 3 just to give it a general non-descript rating, as this is not really a ""rating"" per se."
3,The new trio,"I loved 'The writings on the wall' so I rushed out to buy this having loved thier first two singles.However I found the songs lacked the variation of the previous album.This is probably due to Beyonce writing and producing all of the songs instead of the usal array of She'kpere,Darkchild and various others.I loved Fancy,bootylicious and Happy face. Overall a good album but lacks substance of old."
3,nice... but,"This is a nice album coming from some other artist or group that doesn't have the talent that this ladies of Destiny's Child have. The whole album has a nice rythm and that's the problem, they got a nice rythm and repeated it through the whole cd, it's either slow ballads or pure same beat R&B. Don't get me wrong i love DC but they could have at least put some 2 new beats into this album. They still have the catchy lyrics and of course Beyonce saves a lot of the songs with her amazing vocal performance. It's still a good cd but i expected more."
2,2 Stars,"I think that the song Dangerously In Love is the ONLY good song on there album. Personally I no longer like Destiny's Child after there first album, which is the only album I will ever own. The TRUE Destiny's Child, not Beyonce's Children."
1,"""Survivor"" is childish and amatuerish","This album stinks. This can't be the same ""group"" that put out such stellar tracks as ""Say my name"" and ""Bugaboo"". The production isn't bad but the lyrics are childish and unusually self-righteous. There are some promising ideas on the CD but they never come to fruition. ""Bootyliscious"" is clever with a great Stevie Nicks sample but gets tiring after about a minute and a half and just repeats itself for the remainder of the song. Resist buying this CD but if you have to have it you can find my copy in the used bin at Wherehouse."
1,Bubble gum R&B...what happened?,"I have all of Destiny's Child's CDs and i have to say that this is the worst of all. After all of the controversy, you would think that the girls would want to improve on their last album. But no such luck. The only songs worth listening to are ""Bootiliscious"", ""Emotions"", and maybe ""Dangerously in Love"". Most of the songs consisted of Beyonce's, usually beautiful voice, whining and screeching through the choruses. Plus, some of the tracks sounded so computerized or artificially manufactured. None of the songs have that great of a dance beat like ""The Writing's on the Wall"". I am so disappointed because I am a huge DC fan, but a can bearly stand to listen to this effort. Bring back LeToya and LaTavia!!!"
3,"Not ""Writings on the Wall"" at all","I bought this cd hoping for half as many good songs as The Writings on the Wall. There are maybe 3 good songs: Survivor, Independant Woman pt.1 and Bootylicious. The rest are horrible!"
3,Not what I expected,"I can't deny i was not very happy when i heard all of ""survivor"", although i am happy all the girls have lead parts, the material just is not as good as ""writings on the wall"" and their first CD. I have to admit that I really enjoy the gospel medley, apple pie a la mode, and emotion, however other than those select few, the rest of the album is just not good material, maybe beyonce should stick to singing and let the producers such a Rodney, Shakespere and Kandi, and Poke and Tone do the work. I also do not like how only beyonce is writing, last album all the girls had writing credits. if you liked ""writings..."" do not buy this because you will be unhappy."
1,SURVIVORS??,"The latest album by Destiny's Child featuring Beyonce' Knowles, 'Survivor', in my opinion, was good but not as good as the previous CD 'The Writing's on the Wall'. There were one or two standout songs but for the most part this is one CD that will be played once and then put in the back of the CD book."
2,Disappointed Destiny's Child Fan,"I was so disappointed after listening to the entirety of this CD. I thought after all of the hype on MTV that this CD would be worth buying (even in the age of song-swapping where I already had two of the songs)In my opinion, the only songs I enjoyed were Independent Woman Part I, Survivor and the re-make of Emotion. Hearing that Beyonce produced every track (?) on this album made me think is she only good for her lead vocals and beautiful face?I thought in buying this CD for the incredibly cheap price of less than (...) bucks would make my purchase worth it. Guess not. I want my money back!Sorry girls!"
1,The Novelty Is Wearing Thin,"I loved the ""I'm a sassy girl who doesn't take crap from no man"" posing from their last album, but now I'm just tired of it. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Beyonce, you're a tough, independent survivor and all men are pigs. Now let's move on. Besides the redundant messages, this album also has a sameness to the music. That annoying start-stop beat. Make it stop. Please, make it stop."
4,Why I gave them 4 stars,"I gave this album 4 stars. This album is real tight but I took away a star because they have this song on there album called Nasty Girl, and it says put some clothes on. Its a nice song, but if Destiny's Child is going to sing it (expecially Beyonce) then they have to act it. For example for the main pic of there album, Beyonce's chest is pratically hanging out of her shirt! Have you seen the pics on rollingstones.com? One look at them and its the exactly oppisite of what the song is saying NOT to do. Why am I concerned? I am 13 years old and Destiny's Child is my role model. If there are people a little older then me that hear the song then see the pictures thatt they took, there going to say well there dressing like that, why cant I?"
2,"Survived with Attitude, but Melody Kicked the Bucket","Having been very impressed with the prior album with such fresh songs as ""Bug-A-Boo,"" ""Say My Name,"" and ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" I expected something better from this group. Their latest album relies too much on the success and attitude of their previous. Even the hit title track is weak in melody and chorus, although it is catchy. The track ""Happy Face"" stands out on the album as something more interesting than the rest. Otherwise, the songs on this album lack focus, motivation, and emotion. This is what happens when artists begins to feel invincible. Hopefully they will learn from this mistake and the critics will see through them.."
2,with out the old members they are just weak,"When I listened to this cd, I was thinking it was going to be GREAT. My thoughts changed by the time the cd stopped. It seems like this cd was put together too fast; too much commercial, and not enough emotion. When they had the old members (Latavia and Letoya) their cd was great, but I guess with the member change dc lost their ability to write quality songs. Destinys child should stop trying to live up to the ""diva"" role and be true to themselves. I guess that is what happens when the member who wrote a lot of the songs gets kicked out. (in case you didn't know Letoya wrote 11 out of 17 songs on their last album)Even though, Beyonce says they are better off without the former members, well... by the sound of this cd... they are."
1,not able to put it on my MP3 because of security code,not able to put it on my MP3 because of security code
5,Destiny's Child are the best girl group out there.,"I must admit before this album, I did not like D.C but now they are my favorite girl group. I listen to this album everyday and now I have to buy a new one because it's scratched up. From Independent Women to Dangerouly in love with you this album is hot. I was shocked when I heard that beyonce wrote all this hot songs. She is talented give the girl her credit. And I finally got to hear my girl Michelle sing. She has a beautiful voice. Girls all I can say is keep it up and stay independent,survivoring and bootylicious. And to the Person who said Alicia Keys album is better, I have her cd and I don't think so. D.C 3 forever."
2,Don't sell out,"Sad to see such a talented R&B group sell out to pop music. If any of you frineds say they like R&B and mention that Destiny's Child is their favorite group, chuckle quietly to yourself. After listening to this CD for about an hour, all of the songs began to sound alike. Rin-tinny pop with souful voices trying to outsing each other. I bought it for Independent Women I. Good song. Just skip Ind. Women Part II. It sounds like a song for a kid commercial. So does Happy Face. Poor Beyonce, as gorgeous as she is, she just can't write music. Kelly is actually the strongest singer, but even she can't bring strength to this CD. Save your money and buy Writing's on the Wall. I give that CD four stars."
2,Bad Album,"I have to admit I've always liked Destiny's Child. I thought Survivor was going to be a highly anticipated and really good album. Yet, when I listened to it, I noticed there were so many bad and obnoxious songs such as ""Apple Pie a la Mode"", ""Happy Face"", and ""Bootylicious."" However, I do give it two stars because it does contain some good songs such as ""Story of Beauty"", ""Emotion"", ""Dangerously in Love"", and of course the title track. I'm glad that there is a little more singing by the other members, and I hope that a new album will come which will be better than all their previous albums. Good luck Destiny's Child."
2,Puh-lease,"...I like ""Survivor"",""Bootylicious"",""Brown Eyes"",""Emotions"" and both I.W.But the rest of the album is pure trash.The songs that Beyonce wrote are horrible.They sound like songs Britney Spears would sing.DC needs to go back to what they did in their previous album ""The Writings On The Wall""-collective songwriting.Beyonce has minimal talent,but only when someone else(preferablly two or more writers) writing with her.With Survivor,the group has transcended from r&b group to teenybopper pop..."
4,DC's Surviving,"Destiny's Child has survived alot of things including the loss of two original members and one replacement, but they've fought through the diversions and come up with their most consistent album yet. Beyonce Knowles has stepped out in front and she has hand in writing and producing all the tracks on the album. Ms. Knowles has an exceptional voice and she shows off her range from the high energy title track to the more subdued remake of Samantha Sang's ""Emotion"". The mega hit from Charlie's Angels, ""Independent Women"" shows up in two parts and is a bumping groove despite suffering from being overplayed. ""Bootylicious"" samples Stevie Nicks' ""Edge Of Seventeen"" to great results by creating a hyper kinetic beat. ""Nasty Girl"", ""Fancy"" and ""Apple Pie Ala Mode"" are also strong songs."
5,"""DC 3 "" PURE CLASS",MAYBE IM A BIT BIASED BUT THIS GROUP JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER AS THEY PROGRESS THERE MUSIC IS LIKE WINE THE MORE YOU LISTEN THE BETTER THEY GET I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE SURVIVOR ALBUM AS I THINK IT PAVED THE WAY FOR THEM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BOOTYLICIOUS DOES HELP HA! OH BY THE WAY I AM 41 DOES THAT MAKE ME THEIR OLDEST FAN? I LISTEN TO A LOT OF YOUNG GROUPS AND LIKE THEIR STUFF BUT DC3 ARE THE TOPS FOR ME
4,A VERY RAW Review,"Okay I'll keep this review real SIMPLE!TRACKS THAT YOU'LL HAVE AN LOOP (Potential singles); 'INDEPENDENT WOMEN PART 1/2','SURVIVOR','BOOTYLICIOUS', 'NASTY GIRL', 'EMOTION', 'DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE'.OKAY TRACKS (too good to be album fillers/ too bad to be singles); 'APPLE PIE Á LA MODE', 'SEXY DADDY', 'PERFECT MAN', 'THE STORY OF BEAUTY'.TRACKS YOU WILL SKIP ( very generic + boring) ; 'BROWN EYES', 'FANCY', 'MY HEART STILL BEATS' , 'DANCE WITH ME'.This album is great, 85 % wholesome goodness 15 % generic crap"
5,DC3 IS THE GREATEST,"OK DC3 OR THE NEW AND BEST DESTINY'S CHILD COMBINATION HAVE A GREAT ALBUM ON THEIR HANDS. I MEAN THEY GOTZ REGGAE BEATS BEAT BOXIN WHAT EVER U WANNA HEAR. THE BALLADS ARE GREAT. I MUST SAY BEYONCE KELLY AND MICHELLE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS ALBUM, THERE IS NO MALE BASHING. THIS ALBUM IS ABOUT SURVIVING DIFFERENT THINGS. IT IS NOT THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL REMEMBER THAT... THEY SOUNDS ARE DIFFERENT BUT IF IT SOUNDED THE SAME YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL THAT THEY HAVE GROWN I SUGGEST YOU PICK IT UP"
4,Truly Survivors,"Destiny's Child has proven to be Truly survivors. Survivor is an excellent CD. It has slow Ballads like Dangerously in Love (my favorite), emotions, Brown Eyes. It also has good party songs like Survivor, Nasty Girl. this CD alows you to hear how great they can Harmonize with just three members. You shold really consider buying this CD you wont be disappointed."
4,Worth checking out...,"I enjoyed this DC album more than their sophmore album. Highlights are:Bootylicious (Yes, the Steve Nicks Riff does rock)Independant Woman 1 & 2 (both versions have their own flavor.)Happy Face (it's nice to hear Beyonce sing a upbeat pop song)Story of Beauty (A very heart wrenching song)."
3,"The girls can sing, but...","I still only like 3 songs on this whole album...Independent Woman, part 1, Survivor, and the gospel medley. Oh, Emotions wasn't so bad either. I honestly just wasn't into the rest of the songs on this album. But I didn't waste too much money since I bought it used for 40 cents and now I have my favorite songs on my MP3 player.So, if you asked me would I buy it new, I'd tell you no. And that's my two cents."
2,2 1/2 Stars... What a Mess,"Right away, I will say that this album is a hot mess. This album has nothing but fillers and if it wasn't for the turmoil from the original lineup this horrible album wouldn've ever surfaced. For the exception of ""Survivor"", ""Independent Women Part I, ""Brown Eyes"", and ""Dangerously In Love"" the rest is horrible. If you don't have this album, download it instead or you'll be disappointed."
3,"A good album, but it still needs...something that makes me want to hear it","Destiny's Child 3rd album is definitely not their masterpiece, but it's not an album that you might hate it either. There are lots of good songs, lots of bad songs, but there isn't any great song. This album doesn't even has all the songs that DC recorded to include in this album. There are 3 songs missing (the 3 of them are very good): my heart still beats - dance with me - perfect man.There are barely 3 songs that are the favorites to me: Survivor, Brown Eyes and The Story Of Beauty. Not all the other songs are bad. An example of a bad song from this album is Independent Woman part II. This song shouldn't have been ever made!!! I own this CD from July, 2001 and I swear, I've never listened to this song completely!"
2,More Michelle Less Beyon'ce,"The CD sucks. Most people brought this CD because they saw that ""THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL"" was a great CD. We all made a mistake and shouldn't have brought it.The only songs I like in the order I like them are ""Dangerously in Love"", ""Nasty"", ""Independent Women Part II"", and ""Bootylicious"" Beyon'ce needs to cut out all of the lead vocals and let Michelle's angelic-gospel like voice do all of the work she is doing. Not hating just tired of Beyon'ce and I know that they could do better. The group should be called ""Beyon'ce and Nem"" or ""Beyon'ce and Company""."
3,Interesting but LACK of something,"I bought DC 3 yesterday and I had listen to all of the songs. I was very happy to say that Michelle had given a chance to show off her vocals. She has a very UNIQUE, strong voice and everytime I listen to any songs from the Survivor Album, I would try to listen to Michelle's when she's leading her voice. She sound just like the purest rain that is so beautiful, yet subtle and sweet! Kelly is also talented and of course, since she's the 2nd lead singer, she sound just as good as Beyonce. Beyonce is definetly getting better, I mean her quality of her voice. I have all DC's 3 albums and I can tell you that Beyonce has mature in her singing. This album was not as good as Writing's on the Wall. Personally, I think it lacks of something, like the elements they produced from their earlier hits, such as Say My Name or even Jumpin, Jumpin."
1,THIS CD IS TERRIBLE!!!,"THIS CD SUCKS! IT'S ALL BEYONCE, BEYONCE, BEYONCE! THEIR SECOND ALBUM WAS TIGHT, BUT THIS ONE WAS TRASH. I'M SELLING MINE BACK ASAP. IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT YET - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,"A good message, presented in an upbeat way","This second effort from pop trio Destiny's Child propelled the group into stardome and firmly established them as a leading contender in today's pop music world. Latent with self-empowering tracks like ""Survivor"" and ""Independant Women"", Knowles and company send a clear message to today's female: stand on your own two feet, be proud of who you are. They have taken a different approach to the subject of feminism than most musicians who would be considered feminists today-- Ani DiFranco, Tori Amos, Liz Phair, etc.Even further, the women of Destiny's Child prove that being a feminist does not mean wearing army fatigues and shunning men forever. Instead they continue to be proud of their sex appeal with songs like ""Bootylicious"". While many may see this as hypocritical, I see it to be finding a happy medium between radical feminism and ""old-fashioned values""."
3,"The first three tracks kick, then downhill from there","I hold a great deal of respect for Destiny's Child, especially the resilient Beyonce Knowles. After a disproportionate amount of group reshuffling, Destiny's Child shows, with their third album, they can keep the music coming and still look hot while doing it. Unfortunately, Survivor's only shining points lie in its first three tracks, the beat-bumpin' ""Independent Women"", the high-energy hatefest ""Survivor"", and the irresistibly sexy ""Bootylicious"". After that, it's all downhill. Credit Beyonce for putting a pen to paper and coming up with some decent lyrics, but blame the endless slew of producers and co-writers on the later tracks that recycle well-worn beats and don't really tread any new ground."
1,Get Someone To Write Your Songs!,"Destiny's Child new CD is just that, new and in need of some direction. The girls can sing but unless you are from 6yrs.to 15yrs. old you will not like this cd at all. Advice: Save your money and go out and purchase Alicia Keys. Destiny's Child is on their way out so don't bother wasting your money.They only sold as many cd's as they did because there wasn't really any competition out there. Most of the Female groups had broken up. They were just the only thing available at the time. Do you think they would have gotten all of the hype if Xscape or TLC, would have been on the scene. The answer is NO!Well, think about it! They are to immature to really be a permanent part of the music scene. Please don't take them serious because they are just part of the Nickalodeon Crowd. But hope is on the way! Maybe real soon we won't even have to look at them any more. Time,MAKE IT HAPPEN SOON."
1,More corporate driven garbage,"This album really shows how shallow and greedy the DC girls have become. What's even the point of buying the album, the ""Survivor"" video is shown about 20 times a day on MTV non-stop? And then we have to put up with all the annoying specials about the group, highlighting them and giving them undeserved praise. The other tracks on here are just as annoying, especially the cheesy ballads like ""Brown Eyes"". Do yourself a favor and save your 15 bucks. Why keep adding to this money machine?"
2,I love this CD! 2 Days later...BOORING!,"The first day I got this CD I was totally syched to listen to it. After listening to it for 2 days it got really old. You only listen to the first 5 songs then the rest, well, who cares. 'Survivor' gets old after listening to it for a minute and 'Independent Women' was played way too much on the radio. 'Bootilicious' is all about jelly...?, do you get the point yet? It all becomes really boring. I only gave this CD 2 stars because it got dull. If I could, I would take it back to get my money to go buy the new 'Incubus' CD."
1,Horrible Album,"I just feel sorry for the people who have purchased this God-awful album. It produces not one spectrum of originality. Every song plainly does not come with a point. But I can clearly see this album being bought by a 12 year-old. Because clearly the lyrics are simple. Beat ofcourse is commercial. There whole material is commercial. Most of this material does not apply to most of us anyway. And I this may sound harsh but I think this album deserves every bit of criticism it receives. If you want to hear some good quality rnb music check out Erykah Badu,Jill Scott,India.Arie or even Alicia Keys.Apoc (DC gets no love from me)"
2,Needs Help,"I admire Beyoncé's attempt to be truly ""Independent"" in writing or co-producing all of the songs on this album, but I think she needed a little help. With the exception of ""Independent Women, Part I"" and ""Survivor,"" the majority of the songs on this CD sound rushed and amateurish. Perhaps with a little bit (or a lot) of help, the rest of the songs on this CD could have been polished (or trashed).Don't waste your money on the CD. Instead, turn to MTV or BET anytime during the day, and you're likely to see videos for the only two decent songs on the CD."
3,The writing really is on the wall.,"Doesn't the mediocrity of this cd disprove the claims that Latavia and Letoya were just ""backup singers"" who were in the group just because they were all such great friends? The Writing's On the Wall is a much better album, and that's not an accident.You can't screw with chemistry. The first lineup had it. This one didn't. Now they're over. And the world sighs with relief that the fakeness and pretend love and togetherness no longer has to be witnessed.Now to be fair, half the cd ranges from tolerable to good. The other half is obvious filler. The album as a whole is over-produced and lacks soul that rhythm and blues is supposed to epitomize, therefore it must not be r&b; afterall. But this is no real revelation."
2,Survivor,"Independent Woman and Survivor are the only two good songs on the whole CD. I think ""Nasty Girl"" is very silly and how can you put a gospel song ""Gospel Medley"" on a CD with that other stuff. The last song ""Outro"" in which they are thanking each other, they could have kept that and put something else in place of that. Independent Woman and Survivor are definitely good songs."
5,"Different, and good","""Survivor"" is a great album. It shows much of the production of the group, unlike their last two albums. It puts the talents of all of the women to the test. Thankfully this album doens't have the manufactured formula, ""Destiny's Child"" and ""Writings on the wall"" have. Keep up the good work ""DC""."
4,Architectural Drawing and Light Construction (7th Edition),good book and hard to find. found great price on amazon compared to school book store. using it right now for an Auto cad class.
1,Where is my stuff,I've emailed to the seller about I haven't received my book. That has been over a month from the date I purchased the book. But no one answer me yet. How can I happy about their service. I paid money for nothing. Nobody take charge of that.I think so one should take care of about that.
4,Good pop science,"This book is an example of popular science writing. Too much science to be popular, but too popular to be rigorously scientific. I really hoped it would be better; I really hoped for a little more rigour with the science. For example, Dr. Strogatz mentions that the routers in computer networks spontaneously synchronized their message traffic, leading to bursty traffic patterns. I would have liked to have learned more---how the protocols worked, how this problem was discovered, diagnosed and fixed. Or I would at least have liked to know where I could have gone to get more information on the subject. But the episode was written so generally that I can't track down any more information.I can't help but wonder if some well-meaning but basically ignorant editor cut the science parts, leaving only the pop science writing.This is a good book about an interesting subject, but it could have been better."
3,A great 15-page article,"This is a tough one to review adequately. On the one hand, it is a clear and apparently authoritative introduction to an interesting subject.On the other, it is--hyperbolic, touting each advance as earth-shattering and each contributor to the field as the greatest or most unfairly ignored mathematician, biologist, etc.--repetitive, including analogies that, while sometimes helpful, often become longer and more convoluted than the exposition--self-aggrandizing, with loving attention to details of the author's autobiography that only a mother could pretend to be interested in--amazingly badly read, like an unskilled and condescending teacher reading to kindergarteners.4 for the topic and 2 for its presentation (4 for clarity and 1 for everything else).If Scientific American hasn't published the 15-page article and the topic interests you, my guess is that this is a book that reads much better in hard copy than the Audible recording."
5,I most enjoyed the sleep studies,"Who hasn't wondered about their sleep behavior? I certainly have, especially my wife who has had trouble sleeping (she is a light sleeper), and of course our kids who tend to get up at 7am on the weekends when we just want to sleep in. It provides great background to many of the parenting tips in magazines like, say, Parenting, and various columns in other places out there.Strogatz would also get my recommendation above even Feynman in the colorfulness of his writing. Like QED, I sincerely recommend this as an essential for the book shelf. It is simply a great display of the ability to write about a specific subject and includes many various things that very directly relate to it."
2,Science is old Science - hyped up,"I do not want to be too critical, since there are a number of things in the book which are admirable. The book does go thru the various aspects of what the author calls SYNC, in ways which laypeople can understand. On the other hand, it seems to me that this is simply ""normal modes"" of oscillation, which puzzles people in areas from quantum mechanics to coupled oscillators -- pendulums, etc...So, I think it is a little of reinventing the wheel to call this an emerging science.. It seems to me that ""catastrophe theory"" of a few years ago, and a number of other similar items, are really reinventing the wheel.On the other hand, I have nothing against the book, if it simply were to place the current science in this context..(of normal modes), rather than a new SYNC.. We do not need more reinventions of the same thing.."
4,My review...,"Good book on the subject, the physics part in the middle with super-fluid was difficult when stoned. This is one of the first books which is leading to the convergence of science and religion ( science being the religion of cause and effect ). I especially liked how the book ends with brain-sync to create thoughts and emotions. I've just finished the book ""Mind wide Open"" because I wanted to know more about how the brain worked because of it. I'm now starting ""Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity (Advances in Systems Theory, Complexity, and the Human Sciences)"", all because of this book. So I liked this book as you can tell. But good books written by Math professors are rare."
4,Great starting point to rethink all you know,"Simple language to explain really complex things, it succeeded in most parts, and made me want to read more about the things I couldn't understand."
5,Fascinating!,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I bought this book, but the brief looked interesting and it was only a few bucks. I'm sure glad I decided to check it out. Well-written and thought-provoking, it illuminates the concepts of spontaneous organization, resonance, and chaos theory without a load of heavy mathematics. From fireflies to heart attacks and clocks to jet lag, similar functions are at work all around and within us. Finding out just why and what this means is a great read for anyone who wants to understand how the bits of the world fit together."
5,Considering how cycles are coordinated and humans affected,"'Sync' is the emerging science of spontaneous order, studying the elements of synchrony and chaos and complexity theory and considering how cycles are coordinated and humans affected. This is a relatively new science and in Sync: The Emerging Science Of Spontaneous Order, author and mathematician Steven Strogatz (one of its early pioneers), provides invaluable and informative insights into how enormous systems can synchronize themselves and draw upon underlying connections."
3,Allocate the time to better understand,"I was a little disappointed in this book I must admit. I found that it perhaps did not go into the all the aspects I was interested in. I also found that since there were so many theories that the authors use of constant analogies tended to confuse rather than clarify the situation.However, the book and the topic is still very interesting. I also think that you need to have a grasp of mathematics and physics to get the most from the book. There is however plenty to interest those who want to know more about network theory and how it is evident is so many aspects of our world these days.This is not a book you can simply read before you go to sleep each night. You need to allocate some time and really spend time understanding what the author is trying to get across if you want to get the most from this book."
5,Everything but the Kitchen Sync,"This book is excellent. This book tackles a variety of subjects that appear to have nothing to do with one another- the flashing of fireflies in Thailand, the beating of the human heart, the neural structure of visual perception, the motions of celestial bodies in space, the mysterious nature of social networks, and the internet - and shows how they are all examples of a common phenomena whose invisible and universal influence is only beginning to be understood."
3,Not quite synched,"An interesting book, but rather unfocused and not particularly convincing-- I think he tries too hard to see synch everywhere."
2,I didn't like it.,Not one of my favorite books... It was not related to science in a meaningful way.
5,I think it's cute,"I don't actually have one, my brother does, but I'm the only one who plays with it, except for my sister, who put a shirt on it one night. I love this toy! It doesn't really look like Mewtwo, it's head is the wrong shape, and it's fingers aren't round, and it can't stand unless you prop it's tail against the wall or something, but I still think it's really kind'a cute. It's fairly durable except for the piece of cloth around it's neck, and it's cord (that thing on the back of it's neck) It seems like every Pokemon beanie has a few strings that easily come loose, and on this one those strings are on it's cord, but it's not really much of a problem. This is still a very fun toy, and it fits nicely in my Mew collection. I'm hopeing someday it'll be mine, and if not I'm buying one. It's cute!"
5,MADE ME A SUCCESS!!!,"Three years ago, my boss decided that we should create our own advertising and brochures. I purchased a Mac G3 and went to work, learning everything I could about design. If I hadn't read this book, I would have been a miserable failure. Instead, I was able to create my first brochure (which the printer said was in the top 90% of the brochures he had seen) in less than two months. This book taught me about resolution, file formats, and everything else I needed to know to have my brochure and ads printed correctly. Although I own many books and resources on graphic design and output, this is the one I could not have done without!Sandee and Robin, thank you so much for your help! I couldn't have done it without you!Benjamin Summers, M.B.A. Tomorrow's Resources Unlimited, Inc. www.truball.com"
3,should be updated,"It`s good to have around but this book made on a Powermac 8500 (using Pagemaker!) does feel dated in every sense of the word..PDF - the professional print standard nowadays - is poorly covered. Just one page with useless basic information. The writers do not mention anything about Open Type fonts or Indesign. There's not much about dia scanners, sizes and resolutions either.All in all there's a lot to learn here but the information given often stays a bit on the surface or is simply not up to date. Especially for people who have some experience in the field and are not living in the past.."
5,Great book!,"I teach a graphic design class and use this book in my classroom. The subject matter is misunderstood by so many ""designers"" in this day and age and this book covers all the essential information. I recommend it to all my students as the one book they HAVE to buy."
4,Surprisingly beautiful voice,"Miriam Gauci, Naxos's treasure, delivers beautiful renditions of many popular Italian arias. Well, actually, many Puccini arias--one might want to remind Naxos that Italian opera does not begin and end with Puccini (or Verdi, for that matter). Miriam Gauci's high notes are pure, sweet, and strong, although she seems to vocalize r's, n's and m's as separate syllables. Therefore at the end of the Catalani aria we get ""E fra le nubi d'o-ruh"" instead of ""d'or."" But, diction aside, these are decent versions and with Naxos's low prices, how can you go wrong?"
4,Herriot's fifth book as fun as the other four.,"If you read All Creatures Great and Small, you know all about James Herriot's fun writing style. I had also read his other books that were sequels (All Things Bright and Beautiful, and All Things Wise and Wonderful). I hadn't heard about this one, which is about being a country vet in Yorkshire after World War Two. It's just as good as the others."
5,Happiness and joy in your hands,"Herriot is an unequaled master. He opens the door to the world of veterinary medicine that enables us to walk through the beautiful English landscape and into piles of muck, mud, slush and into warm farmhouses of hard working men and women. We are able to share his love of all animals, his tenderness and understanding of those who call (most often at 2 or 3 in the morning) to hurry and check the swollen/scratched/itchy/whatever it is on the toe, nose, paw, side, tail of the dogs and cats that are the only companions of elderly men and women.I could talk for hours and relate adventure and after adventure. Buy this book and ALL of the companion Herriot books. Have your children read them. Read them to your non-reading children. Share with your friends and family (but put your name in the book. Somehow ownership seems to change once another person gets their hands and eyes on your book.)"
3,A Fitting Conclusion,"My wife and I just finished reading the whole series of four Herriot books. I think that the first one (_All Creatures Great and Small_) is probably the best one overall. The author probably put the best stories he knew into his first book. But there are several delightful stories spread through the later books, and all four make for enjoyable reading.This book has a couple unique features. One is that the author goes on a couple international adventures traveling as caretaker of some overseas animal shipments. These are interesting travel stories on their own. Also in this book we meet James' children and see them grow up to some degree._The Lord God Made Them All_ is a fittingly warm and pleasant conclusion to a really enjoyable series of books."
5,A wonderful book in a wonderful series,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312498349/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleJames Herriot's book ""The Lord God Made Them All"" is the final book in his series about his experiences as a Scottish veterinarian, dealing with both large and small animals. His love for his patients and their owner's shines through in every story, and takes the reader through the gamut of emotions from laughing out loud to tears of frustration and empathy.Dr. Herriot was, without a doubt, a man who put his patients and their owners far above financial gain, and that is what sets his stories and the loyalty of his patient's owners apart from anyone in his time. If he was called, he went, no matter what time, the weather, the circumstances.His love for his profession may not have made him rich, but he set a standard for veterinarians everywhere that has yet to be matched.This is a wonderful book with only with disappointment:that it ends when the reader finishes the final page."
5,Great for Preppers,"Saw this today, snapped it up. The $80 one is lighter but the wheels (small ones) are crappy. This one is only $199 at Home Depot."
1,Do not buy this product,"This ""choir"" doesn't sing in a normal manner - they aim for a sound that is not unlike that of bad Shakespearean actors, and the ""music"" that results sounds like a drone tone, as well as unsophisticated because it is purposely primitive, and really, when all is said and done, not human, but more alien. Perhaps this will sell well when the creatures from Independence Day rule us.To see what is so much better than this - to hear Tallis done right - one need only sample Robert Shaw's ""O Magnum Mysterium."" Look at that CD for Tallis' ""If Ye Love Me"" and ""A New Commandment."" Once you hear that, you'll wonder why so much time and effort went into this recording, when the participants didn't even want to make music."
1,Misleading,"Don't waste your time. it's just 90 min trailer on the merits of the presenters own trading programme. Nothing wrong with that... but why didn't they just call the video what it is... ""Using Tims Winning System to trade High-performance stocks"". The only value for users of other programmes looking for a few ideas on system building... can be downloaded for free at traderslibrary.com/tradesecrets. this has all the parameters Tim uses."
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't be tricked by the title, total piece of junk, basically he is advertising his own software, no usefull information of any kind. I bough this tape very cheap (10 $), but I still regret it"
1,Garbage,"This burner is junk. It burns single-layer (4.7 GB) disks fine but every dual-layer disk (8.5 GB) fails, creating a lot of expensive coasters."
1,USB 1.1 cable for a 4GB PDA?,"Don't buy this product.... this cable is too slow for today's PDAs.I wanted to buy a single sync/charge cable for my LifeDrive. palmOne provides a USB 2 (hi-speed) sync cable and a separate charger.I thought it would be a USB 2 cable as the one provided by palmOne for the LifeDrive.Also, this product was released in 2002 so it's not designed to fit today's PDAs.I wish I could return it but I'm out of the country at the moment."
4,"Churchill China Brook Pink 9-inch Soup Bowls, Set of 4","The Churchill soup bowls are a nice size with attractive wide rims. I like them very much and will use them for a ""soup and sandwich"" supper. I had initially purchased the the set with eight place settings and the serving pieces. I am adding to it as I find good buys. I considered this a very good price for the four bowls."
4,The ceremony is beautiful,"Some people like saint James are just haters. Yes, the wedding was over the top at some points but I heard Prophetess Bynum say that her love for Bishop Weeks was once in a lifetime so her wedding was going to be a once in a lifetime wedding. It was not a traditional ceremony at all but I think that's the reason I appreciated it so much. If you truly understand everything Prophetess Bynum has been through, you would understand how everything in her life is a miracle. Just a word of caution for everyone. When you say something negative about a man or woman of God, you'd better be 100% positive about what you're saying."
3,"great product, replacement bins a problem","This product was in our home when we bought it. It works wonderfully to keep the recycling out of the way and sorted . The slide is 10 years old and works like a dream. About once a year we have to figure out how to remove a bag or plastic bottle. I recommend the vacuum for the bag, and a knife for the bottle, a plumbers snake, for example is too small. The lids on the bins are a nice thought , but other than used aluminum foil nothing is a source of odor (we rinse out all the cans and wash all the jars and bottles. Replacement bins...... That's why I am at Amazon tonight."
4,Great product so far,"So far this item seems to hold up very well even when my 8 month old grabs and shakes the panels. The only complaint I have is some of the panels had small plastic strings stuck to them, likely from the molding process at the manufacturer. My daughter has pulled them off but we have been lucky to catch her before the strings go in her mouth."
5,Good product,"sturdy construction and works well for our 11-month old. When I am with her, we are usually out exploring the house together, but this is a good place fo her to play when I need to cook or wash dishes. with the extensions, this play yard is large enough for her to play in our living room. I don't think it is big enough without them."
3,Serves it's purpose,"Works well to temporarily house an infant/toddler and toys when I need to disappear to the loo or remove something hot from the oven. The folding process takes a bit to get used to and the knobs you are supposed to tighten in place and loosen to fold don't really do anything. It is only stable in the hexagon configuration. It comes in handy, especially while caring for two, and I am glad we have it."
2,Not the best,We bought the Superyard XT and used it at the in laws. Worked great.... we wanted one for home but wanted a taller one with a gate. This brought us to the Summer play yard. Not so good.... too lightweight and flimsy. The connections were hard to get right and the gate did not work so well.Amazon is always upstanding and the return process is easy.
5,Infant secure Play...Great,"This is a really nice product. Easy to move, secure and I do not have to worry about saftey issues with the product. Sturdy yet ""lightweight"" considering the job it needs to do.would even consider expaning this.Deidra"
5,kid safety,"Great safety apparatus. It has really made life easier for our daughter when she wants to work outside. Her son has a safe haven to play in, and his mother doesn't have to worry about his running onto the road. Because of the size, he doesn't mind it either."
3,mom of 18 month old twins,"This product is a little flimsy and the ""handle"" is attached by a snap, which no one tested to make sure that it would stay snapped under the weight of the product. As a mother of twins, I purchased this product so that I could contain my girls during my sons little league football games. It definitely does that, but it would have been nice to have a better/more secure way of lugging that thing around. Its heavy and impossible to carry out to the field when I am already pushing a double jogging stroller with a diaper bag, umbrellas and a fold up chair for my self."
5,Happy Grandparents,The Summer Infand Secure Surround Play Yard is exactly as advertised. Easy to assemble. Gate works perfectly. Just what we need to keep our grandbabies safe and ourselves sane.
4,Love This,I purchased this to use outside in my back yard to keep the little ones out of the way of the swings and out of the bark mulch. I run a home daycare and would recommend this product for short term use so you can have a free hand for a minute! The walk through gate is not very user friendly!
4,Great product,"I like that the panels move easily and the play yard can be whatever shape I need. The size was a bit small, so I ordered an extra one, and now it's just right. The only draw back are that panels are difficult to remove and add back on, otherwise, it's a great product!"
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting a great product from the reviews I saw. I bought the gate because it is taller than the other play yards out there my son is 1 and just learning to walk he is also very tall for his age. He moves the play yard around like a walker I've tried to wedge it between furniture so he can't move the whole gate. But he manages to get the gate free or he dumps the gate over the gate should be more sturdy being it is made for Tots!! I'm now looking for a new Play yard.
4,"Great play yard, perfect for the price...","I purchased this item for my 7 month old son, I wanted him to have a safe place to crawl and play while I did household chores and couldn't necessarily keep him under supervision. I also love that it is tall enough to keep his rough playing 3 year old cousin out of reach. The play yard is very large so he is plenty entertained and his toys are safe from my playful dog who doesn't know the difference between his and hers. The only complaint I have is that the gate latch sticks, making it difficult to get in after a fussy child laying flat on the floor. All in all an outstanding product that I would recommend for every mom."
3,Look at the dimensions,"I bought this for a friend who had two kids and needed to isolate a place where they could play safely. What this really is is a low cage. I didn't look at the dimensions and it turned out to be way, way to big for her apartment. It can be made smaller but it was still to big for her space. This would be nice for a big back yard. It was interesting but not for us."
2,It came broken,"When I received the Surround play yard, two panels were broken( the knobs at the bottom that connect two panels together were snapped off and in the bottom of the box). I did not return the item because the next day I had a 15 year old beagle returning home from major neck surgery and needed it immediately. I've been using it as a pen with four panels but I definitely didn't get what I payed for."
5,Love this Pen,I borrowed this from a friend 7 months ago for my new Westie pup. When she asked for it back; I had to have one! These are great. The idea of an expandable safe area is what makes this the only choice. I had a bit of trouble with assembling it; but once you figure it out it is good and sturdy and worth the effort!! It is great for children or new puppies alike! Highly recommended... :)
4,play yard,"Play yard is great! Works indoors and out, keeps children in and safe, or can be used to keep children out and away and safe!"
4,Great... with the Two-Piece Extensions!!!,"We purchased this for our 15 month-old twins to play in but it was a little small (even with one child and toys it would be small). So we purchased 2 Two-Piece Extension kits and it is awesome. It is durable and sturdy as long as you don't make it into a square or rectangle, I don't know why but it is easy to push over in these shapes. The playyard keeps the children safe in areas that may be too open or not childproof. It is easy to store or take along on outings... just fold and go.I highly recommend this product for people with children on the go."
5,Our Daughter Loves It!,"We purchased 2 of the Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yards so that we could have a large space for our daughter to play in, and flexability. It has been perfect - our daughter loves to go in ""her space"" and play, and it gives us some security knowing that she wont dart out into less safe parts of the house in a moment's inattention. We even join her in ""her space"" because she likes to play there so much, it is where we play with her!The yard is very flexable in its use - at home, as our daughter is in ""cruizer"" mode, we arranged the yard so that her favorite couch is inside the walls, so she can cruise along the couch and get her walking practice! We also take one or two of the yards with us on visits, giving us a quick way to create a safe haven for her in homes that are not necessarily child proofed.Not much more to say other than it works as needed, is sturdy, easy to transport - it was exactly what we needed."
2,Doesn't need to be made so poorly - not worth the money,"To get right to it, it's crap. it's made very poorly, it can easily be flipped over by a child that is able to stand and lean on one side of it, and it is very easy for a child to reshape and move it across the room. On two occasions our 11 month old twins were able to flip it over on it's side and come close to getting very hurt (there were more stunned then anything, and OK).While we don't leave them unattended in the gate very often, it has become clear that even a few minutes is a bad idea. Even if we only put one of them in there we have the same problems.I just can't believe a company would put this out knowing it's so poorly crafted. Personally, I would be ashamed. I do not recommend this product. I know others have had success, but I'm just not happy with it. I can't see it even lasting more then 6 months.Buy at your own risk!"
5,Getting My House Back While Creating Safe Play Space,"My extremely gifted climber was out of control and so I ordered this play yard. She had already managed to escape our 22"" Todays Kids play yard and so I was shopping for something 30"" or so. This one fits the bill and has been goood so far. I have had it for a month. I also have the 2 panel extension which creates a ""playroom"" that is inviting and spacious enough for a couple more people to come inside, sit down, and play.Now, my toddler is contained and the mess is contained. Owning the play yard has inspired me to organize her toys, putting some back, as I rotate them in and out of the yard. My daughter has benefitted from the ""new again"" toys, thus making confinement less of a drag. Since we now have all of her toys exclusively in the play yard, she actually wants to go inside her ""playroom""."
5,satisfied customer,i bought this product three weeks ago for my dog and her pupies and so far i am very satisfied with it thanks.
2,Used to like it...,"This pen WAS great. My little boy who is 17 months old got this around Xmas time last year. We were using it and it was working great. After a while the tighteners started falling off and worse yet, dropping itty bitty screws randomly without warning. As you all know a 1 year old WILL put shiny little things in their mouths. Three times now I have found screws on the floor from the gates. Thankfully, I found them, not my baby boy. It's something I will contact consumer services about since I think these screws are a complete danger/choking hazard to toddlers, and pets for that matter. I purchased 2 of these sets and trying to contact the company is a JOKE. They want the gates back, they want ME to ship them back and then wait for weeks for a possible replacement, if THEY find them to be defective, YEAH OK!! Go with something else."
2,"Looks sturdy, but isn't","I bought this because I needed something to put my son in while I did house work... something roomy. I also purchased the extension. Once he was in it he would stand up against it and it would bend or move so easily. He wasn't even trying to move it or bend it and it would. My mom had the other brand yard and it was much sturdier! I wanted to try this one because I like this brand, but I would highly recommend the other brand. The gate is a nice addition to this one though, and that is why I gave it any stars."
3,"Okay, but definitely not great.","The good thing about this play yard is that it easily folds up and is a cinch to travel with or put into storage.The bad things about it are that mainly that my daughter was able to move the play yard around the ENTIRE living room. In order to stop that foolishness, I had to tie the gate to a sofa leg and a bookshelf leg. That was the only way it was stabilized enough so that she couldn't move it. Also - the knobs that are supposed to tighten up and make the desired shape more stable? Well, they don't really tighten that well. I'm a strong woman, and I gave it every ounce of strength I had, and let me tell you - that thing folded up first chance it got. No matter how tight you think you've go tit, it isn't tight enough.Overall, it's an alright gate. It certainly wasn't what we hoped it would be [...]. It was a step up from the Pack 'n Play, and it did allow my daughter to gain more confidence with the way she walked."
3,Waste,"I bought this for my twins but they HATE being in it. Its also big and takes up a lot of room to unfold. And its too tall in my opinion. It has a door, but if you just wanted to pick your baby up, you have to go in through the door because its too hard to reach them over the side. I can see it coming in handy outdoors maybe, but its the middle of winter up here and we aren't outside that much right now. If you have a small apartment or a normal sized home, this is just too huge. If I had a 3000 sq. foot home with an open floorplan, maybe, but for my little ranch it takes up half the living room! I'm glad I didn't pay much because in a year we've only used it a handful of times."
5,Summer Infant Play Yard,This product was purchased to protect our Christmas tree from our two puppies. It worked great. It is easy to move and to open and close. We were missing some safety caps when it arrived but it has not affected the function of it. Now with our third child on the way I am sure we will be using it more. We have taken the sections apart and used just two or three of them to section off parts of the house from the dogs and that has worked well too.
3,partial relief!,"Our grandson is 17 months old and is climbing out of his playpen and crib and running all over the place. My husband and I babysit for him and he wears us out. We bought this playard to safely contain him. At first he loved playing in it, but not long after he is climbing out of it too. He plays in it for a while, which is nice because it gives us partial relief. We really like it a lot, but wish it was made different so he could not climb out of it! On the whole though, we love it even for partial relief!"
2,"NOT SAFE, NOT SECURE","I bought two, one for me and one for my daughter. My grandson of 16 months wasn't in the playyard 5 minutes when he pushed the whole thing across the room. I saw that it would collapse on him so I took him out. There is no way to secure it to the floor when used inside the house. Perhaps it could be staked in the ground outside to prevent movement. However, we're using it as a fence to block off an area but I wouldn't leave a child unattended. My grandson can move the fence out of the way with no problems."
2,Waste of money,"Good idea but not very useful. Using it outside my son HATED being in here, even with toys. Inside he cried and cried. Get a pack n play, lots more use and not as expensive!"
2,Not what I expected,"I needed a gate to block off my living room from the hallway which has a large opening about 10 feet wide (like all usual apartments in the USA). This gate does not allow to be attached to the walls and can only be setup as a perimeter, just like it shows on the picture. For people who just want to do this and have a small perimeter setup for their kids, it might be just fine for the price that it is. However, in my case this gate does not work. I returned it and got the ""North States 3-in-1 Metal"" gates instead which can be attached to the walls as well as be set up as a perimeter. The metal gates are also more sturdy than this Summer Infant Play Yard.As for Amazon.com... I am very glad to do business with them, they were nice over the phone and I was able to return the item without any problems."
4,"Love, love, love it!!!","I purchased this play yard with the extension kit for my home daycare. I have 2 crawlers and one very active 18 month old. I needed something that would be large enough for 2-3 kids to play in while I am changing diapers, making meals, cleaning up etc. I love the fact that this play yard is tall! The 18 month old is trying to climb out of everything, and he doesn't even attempt to climb this!!! It is nice and sturdy and I love the gate feature. That is essentially why I chose this brand over a different brand, because of the gate, and I am so glad I did! The reason I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because the directions were a little hard to follow about adding the extension panels, and the panels took a little work to attach. But, I figured it out and it works beautifully! It only takes a couple of minutes to set up, and take down is just as quick and simple. I don't know how I ever got along without it!!"
3,Play Yard Fence,"I like this play yard fence, but my 11 old does not really want to stay in there. It is nice because I can separate his area full of toys, but when it is open there is no stability. He pulls himself up on the fence and it bends so he could fall."
2,Didn't work for my dog,"I have used other liquid additives in the past that have worked on my Yorkie's terrible breath, but this one didn't do anything for him. I've went through the entire bottle, and no results."
4,bad breath killer,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT. after about a two days of use my dogs breath was completely neutral. it didnt smell good but it didnt smell horrible either. he can breath in my face now without wondering why i look like someone just shot me. And his teeth look whiter too. Only problem is that after about two weeks you run out, so i may try some dental bones and see how they work.AllinAll a great product."
4,Makes Breath Fresher!,"Our poor dog had some awful breath before we tried this product. Add a tiny bit to each bowl of water and her breath is much, much better. Only downside is you have to keep using the product. If you run out, your dog's breath will be back to it's nastiness in a day. I have used one other product that supposedly works the same, but it didn't work at all. This one does."
1,Disgusting ingredients,"I wish the ingredients had been listed before I bought this, because if I had known what was in it, I would never have purchased this product. It contains both EDTA and paraben. I don't use any products containing these ingredients on my own skin (e.g., face wash, body wash) and I certainly won't allow my dogs to consume/ingest anything that contains these ingredients. What a waste of my $8."
2,Does not work,"This product may freshen your dog's breath slightly, but dogs get bad breath for the same reason humans do - bacteria build up in the mouth.My dog has truly awful teeth, which are covered with plaque within minutes of a cleaning. I bought this product in hopes that it would help keep his teeth clean. I have used it faithfully every day for several months, and I can say with some confidence that it makes no difference. If you really want your dog to have healthy, clean teeth, you will have to suck it up and brush them. CET makes excellent products for pet dental care."
2,"funky smell, no noticeable results","I thought I'd give this a try with my dog (Australian kelpie mix) even though she doesn't have any current problems with plaque. The product has a gross smell to it that my dog didn't seem to like. I stuck with the product and used the whole bottle, but I noticed my dog didn't drink as much water and there wasn't a noticeable difference with her teeth. We'll just stick with lots of chewy toys and brushing."
3,Still waiting for results...,"So I was really excited to try this product because I have heard many great things about it. But was a little skeptical at first...and so was my dog. He normally drinks about a bowl of water a day, and I usually fill his bowl up every morning. The first week that I put this in his bowl I was only refilling his bowl every other day, which got me slightly worried. So now what I am trying is switching every other day with the solution in it just to get him used to it.But even after all this (and its been about three weeks) I am not noticing and significant difference in his breath. So for now I am still skeptical. I am going t continue using this product and will update when done."
5,Freshens Breath,My dog can't tell he's drinikiing dental fresh. I have a hard time brushing his teeth and this makes it much easier to freshen his breath without all the hassle.
1,My dog is NOT smiling right now...,"I gave her some in her bowl last night. I mixed a bottle of it so I could make sure I got the right measurements, and then I would pour it into her bowl. She didn't have any problems drinking it, but when I woke up this morning the poor thing had gone to the bathroom all over the place. Diarrhea every were! I would watch your dog after giving it to them, some might just have sensitive tummies."
2,Gave my dog EXPLOSIVE diarrhea!,"I don't really understand how this has happened to nobody else, b/c this gave my dog the most liquid, rank, explosive diarrhea she's ever had. It literally caused her first ever in-the-house accident. I had given it to her for 2 water bowl refills, so not TOO long. I stopped giving it to her and returned it immediately- maybe she was allergic?Bottom line: I personally wouldn't use it again, and if you do use it with caution- it might give your dog diarrhea. >.<"
3,I have a question!,"Okay, so I have not tried this product but I am planning on it after reading such good reviews (and seeing what a great price it is compared to similar products!), but I have a question before I do.Does anyone know if this would work with pet water fountain bowls with built in filters? I would like to use this product with an automatically filtering pet water fountain and would be sad if for some reason it filtered out all the useful product! I haven't purchased either item yet though, and would probably forget about the fountain if it wouldn't work with this stuff, as I'm most eager to try it! any help would be great."
4,5 weeks of use,"The difference in breath in my 4-year-old miniature pinscher was noticable within 12-16 hours. Two days later and her doggy breath was gone. It wasn't miserable to begin with, but I definitely didn't want her affectionate tongue anywhere near my face. Min Pins don't have the early onset teeth problems that other small breeds have. Her teeth, after 5 weeks, are a bit brighter white put there is still yellow build up closer to her gums on most teeth (plaque/tartar/calculus). I can't get myself to brush her teeth myself so I am now getting it done monthly (where she gets a nail grinding and bath too) and using this item as well as Greenies (which she goes crazy for!) ProDen PlaqueOff Animal For Dogs & Cats, 60 gm and C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Petite Dogs, 30 Chews.Anyway, for this product, 5-6 tablesoons for a gallon of water as instructed has really done the trick."
5,This stuff works!,"My 17lb dog/puppy had the worst smelling breath to the point, he'd light up the room! I used this for a week and it helped alot!"
4,It works,I am glad I saw this online. The price is fair. And most importantly it works. My dogs did not even know something was added to their water.
2,poor description,"dont let the picture fool you, of course thats really all you have to go by because the descrition sucksjacks are poorly packaged nothing done to protect from shipping damageend caps are to thin and should be welded onNo locking pins are includedAmazon should require all sellers to have a detailed description of all products sold on their web sitethanks: Reid's Renovation"
2,Disappointing,"After purchasing this book, I was dissapointed to see very few pictures and ideas for everyday homes. I was expecting to find basic window covering ideas for drapes and valances. This book was more on the artsy side as opposed to the practicle decorating side."
5,Excellent example of Australian pop music,This is a great album and I recommend it to anyone and dare them not to enjoy it!I am currently living in the UK and really miss the Australian music scene. Albums like this remind just how much I am missing.To hear it is to love it!
1,Sure hope we can get 50% of the ingrediants the author uses,"Only a fair regular cookbook and really not useful for Y2k. The author must think that we will be able to get to the store for butter, dozen clams scrubbed, fresh squessed lemon juice, sour cream, etc. I was hoping to get a cookbook that uses canned goods or survival type foods."
4,Contains many tasty and nutritious recipes,"Besides the many tasty and nutritious recipes, the book offered a lot of good cooking suggestions for a novice such as myself. I also found the dietary information such as number of calories and amount of protein per serving useful for my exercise program. The included emergency food storage list was also helpful as a reminder of what needs to be bought in case there is a Y2K crisis."
4,Excellent for people without extensive cooking skills,"Being a widower and terrible cook, I have been surprised with the ease of use and results. I really like the health information, such as calories, percent from fat, amount of protein, etc. Also the ability to substitute ingredients, such as honey for sugar, etc.. I purchased this book at a preparedness show but find it's day to day uses excellent. I met the author at the show and she seems very knowledgeable concerning both cooking and nutrition."
2,Out of touch,"After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how ""out of touch"" this book is with the actual exam. Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa. I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam. I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par."
5,This Lady Writes!,"You have to understand, I really dig Portia da Costa's books. I haven't read one yet that I didn't enjoy. She has the ability to set up a scenario that obliges her heroine to grab hold of a problem and then to pull YOU into the action. ""Hotbed"" is classic da Costa. You watch with fascination and concern as she goes deeper and deeper into a increasingly ambiguous & scary situation, but you can't put the book down because it's just too Hot, just too compelling! Do yourself a favor -- read this one!"
5,relaxing music,"This cd includes absolutely the most relaxing music i have ever listened to..Shirley Rumsey's voice is soo charming that with the viola guitar etc. you just feel like closing your eyes and relax..worth it's cheap price...you won't regret if you like slow renaissance ,old music, trust me.."
4,"santa mouse, where are you?","wonderful holiday book. However, I'm trying to locate a version which was illustrated by Elfrieda DeWitt and published by Grosset & Dunlap in New York in 1968. Classic tale which deserves to be passed on from generation to generation."
5,The best of the best,"This book is outstanding, well written, insightful, and pulls together so many different angles on handicapping. The only problem is trying to digest all that is here. Excellent work."
1,Book Not for Beginners,"This book rates a 1 Star unless you are totally proficient in reading Chinese characters. The directions are in English and the examples are in Chinese characters. The discription of the book does not point this out. This book is pretty worthless to one learning the language. However, if one is totally proficient and an expert in reading Chinese characters, it would probably rate a 5 Star. Judging from the English directions, the information/examples (written in Chinese characters) appear to be written in a helpful format."
4,Cork Stopper Lamp Kit,Made 2 Wine Bottle Dave Matthews Band Lamps with this kit! I rewired the socket and put it through a hole drilled by a glass cutting bit and attached a small set of 15 christmas light to the socket with a flasher bulb to blink! And also filled the bottom with about 2 inches some aquarium gravel to hold as a base since it becomes top heavy with bulb and shade attached to wine! Just what I was looking for to complete my project!
1,josffaj@yahoo.com,My DVD can only read and write at a speed no higher than 8X.Amazon's image showed an 8X. But the product delivered wasa 16X. It's very frustrating to return items after waitinga week or more. Find a way of verifying the technical specificationsbefore ordering.
1,"The release time is suspect,","If it is so important that we get the ""truth"" on John Kerry, why hardly even a peep,until after the convention is over? If they felt so strongly about it, why not go after him during the primaries or at least before the convention when there was some chance of knocking him out of the race? Likewise can anybody with a straight face say our POWs were tortured because of John Kerrys testimony? Or that no one knew of these atrocities until John Kerry ""treasonously lied""? This is a slick parody of investigative journalism not to be taken seriously. The self inflicted wound crap is a real hoot."
1,Vile Bush Propaganda,I read this book and found it to be a total lie. I did my own research after reading it and John Kerry was a true war Hero. John Kerry was in Vietnam while Bush was AWOL in Texas. Do not buy this trash.
1,Manuscript probably written in crayon,"This compendium of lies should be retitled ""Unfit for Publication: Middle-Aged Developmentally Disabled Depends Users Shill for George Wussolini Bush."""
1,It's all Over,This book is all lies. At least Kerry was in Vietnam unlike that dodger Bush. These guys are just trying to profit off of America in the worst way possible.
1,a piece of trash,Don't waste your money on this book. It is a complete waste of time and money. I am a Republican supporting Bush but this book goes beyond common sense. The authors of this book arent doing anyone any favors. It is so bad that it will probably cause a backlash and end up helping Kerry.
5,Excellent Report by Real Combat Veterans!!,"""Unfit for Command"" reads like former military personnel wrote it from their actual experiences and not dreamed up like Kerry's ""veterans"" in 1971 and 1972! Kerry is a Vietnam War veteran but that is as far as he goes because his overall service there was disgraceful and not worth any medals other than those for service. I highly recommend that every veteran read this book!"
1,Unproveable smears and innuendo,"As a registered independant, I have problems with both parties. But this is such obvious smear campaign dirty politics type stuff. Purchasing this b will only lower the level of dirty politics in this country. If it keeps up, soon we will be like the Philippines or Argentina where everyone accuses everyone else of robbery,murder and revolution. Do your part to stop this escalating cycle of smear campaign tactics- ignore this nonsense...The text is mostly just innuendo, spins, etc. Even John McMain - a likely future Republican presidential candidate- was smeared in a very similiar way by Bush supporters during a past campaign and publicly accused Bush of being behind it at the time.The recently formed ""swiftboat"" organization's primary Kerry attacker was recently exposed as a complete b'ser. His medal citation for the SAME action also had MANY references to hostile fire! Yet he claimed Kerry's was untrue! How's that for hypocritical bs!!"
1,Written by some sad and angry men...,"willing to distort the truth and in some cases outright lie to discredit a man they are clearly very angry with over his testifying to Congress in 1971. Nothing in the military records support their claims; this book is an attempt to discredit John Kerry through any means necessary. I find it particularly ironic that they are doing to him exactly what they complain he did to them by testifying of atrocities in Vietnam, and also that this group has the nerve to say anything about John Kerry's service with a sitting President who used his father;s connections to avoid the draft, and not even show up for his own service! This type of book is exactly what we should not be talking about. How about the overseas exportation of jobs, tax cuts for the very wealthy, our deficit, and the mishandling of the environment?"
1,Wonder why this book has just come out now??????,"Terrible, just terrible! Shows just how fearful the members of one party have become that they have to try to smear another candidate's good name and war record. Whatever happened to truth, honesty and fair play? It's a sad commentary on today's U.S. politics."
1,Already discredited... why would you read this tripe?,The U.S. Navy and all governmental recordkeeping agencies have already discredited the claims of this book. To buy this book is to support the liars and war profiteers who are so desperate to retain Duh-byuh as their frontman that they smear a war hero. Compare Kerry's record of heroism to that of a *proven* deserter who defrauded the government by collecting pay while he failed to fulfill his (rich-boy chicken-hawk) obligation to the National Guard! This book is part of the ongoing campaign of the far right to destroy the very fabric of our great nation and replace the stars and stripes with the Halliburton logo. Disgraceful. Treasonous.
1,Transparent Propoganda,"I wanted to know what these guys have to say, so I borrowed this book and was not impressed. If you've seen the comercials you've seen everything you need to know that these guys are just a bunch of quacks with a chip on their shoulder and a not-so-hidden agenda. These guys can't even substantiate any clear connection to Kerry other than they were in the same general area sometime when he was. Some of these guys have even flip-flopped their position on Kerry, at the time of the contested incidents they seemed to think he was a brave and heroic soldier, then now they suddenly change their minds? Obviously they have a political agenda. Not very credible. Besides, why are we debating the service of a man who voluntarily went to Vietnam and was decorated for his courage and these guys aren't even questioning the integrity of a president who flaked from the National Guard at the time because he had ""other priorities"" (his words)?"
4,A Very Good Book.,"Its a very good book but things have to be balance. Sometimes, media effects are quite devasstating on our choices. I suggest reading The Bewildered Herd with it."
1,Unfit for Reality,"After four years of black and white, with us or against us thinking from this administration, it's no surprise that people actually believe that this book has something to contribute. Anyone who creates cognitive dissonance by holding more than one idea in his head at a time - something that used to be called critical thinking - must be ""weak"" or ""hiding something,"" the new cw goes. George Bush is a lying, manipulative, and I might add very scared, man. He's clearly in over his head. This book is financed from his family's Texas cabal. It is quite obvious to anyone who will let themselves see it. It's a pattern. It's a psychosis. Why support a president who does not care about you. Honestly - do you really think Bush, who could not pry himself out of an elementary school chair on 9/11, is looking out for you? Spending hard-earned money on this text makes one guilty of the same kind of short-sighted economic activity in which Bush engages."
1,Only Now,"In Kerry's 24 years of public service never was a word of this mentioned. Through 4 important Senatorial campaigns, no one thought it important enough to make it an issue. Yet now they come out of the wood work. And oddly, all the occusers like Bush. Isn't it strange that no one is saying I dislike what Kerry did in Vietnam, and I dislike what is happening in Iraq today! Why is it that all these people coming out today are Bush supporters? Doesn't anyone in the administration care for the truth?"
1,Unfit for Print,"A dispicable publication given life by a right wing smear campaign of John Kerry. More than an attack on Senator Kerry's military service, this is an attack on the military's method of honoring its service members. Either we can believe the Navy's records and the men who actually were witnesses to the events in question or we can believe Mr. O'Neill and his cohorts--who come forward 35 years later with radically different versions. It's one thing to disagree with a politician's position on issues; however, a screed such as this is beyond the bounds of ""honest"" debate. Has American discourse fallen so far?"
1,False information.,"This book is completely absurd. The information on here has no real backround what so ever, and the writer is horrible.Don't beleive this propaganda."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This is not the truth. This is a book written by bitter Republicans who are trying to get George W. Bush reelected. Their smear campaign is disgusting. I think if it were the other way around, it would be different. As hard as it may be, try to imagine Bush serving in Vietnam and earning Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star. Imagine a left-wing group attacking Bush's service in Vietnam. Imagine what the backlash would be from the right-wing media and Republican supporters on the President. I think the term, ""Anti-American"" would be thrown around."
5,Not a Nobel Prize candidate ---just a great Espose on John Fraud Kerry,"While this book certaintly would never garner a Nobel Prize, it does do a terrific job of exposing what a fraud John F (stands for Fraud?) Kerry really was and is. This is must reading for all Americans who truly love their country. Do not believe that just because Kerry was resoundingly defeated last year that the terror is over. How many Americans died by defending their country and because they do not have the right armor to protect themselves (thanks to Kerry voting against it)"
4,why this book is NOT a Smear Campaign,"This book chronicles eye-witness accounts from those who served with John Kerry in Vietnam. I personally respect Kerry's service, but feel that honest questions are raised by these swift boat vets. They were there. If Kerry has the right to run on his experience, then these vets also have the First Amendment right to tell their story. If you don't want to read it, don't, but no one can tell another American they cannot. Perhaps these eye-witness accounts are not entirely factual, but interestingly, much of what is chronicled in this book are the very words of John Kerry when he testified before the Senate in 1971. The most recent TV Swift Boat Vet for Truth Ad uses John Kerry's own words, in which Kerry broadly accused our Vietnam vets of the most heinous of war crimes. If Kerry supporters are upset with the contents of this book and the TV ads, they should be angry that John Kerry said those things at that Senate hearing. What he said was wrong- Period."
5,I didn't know that Kerry made that same mistake in Ohio!,"Well thank you paid Kerry shill and numbnuts troll for bringing that to my attention. Kerry sure has a problem with states doesn't he? Should have had Howie Dean with him, there is on guy who ar least knows how to recite the states.The only things I remember about Ohio pertaining to Kerry was the nonsense in that rented hunting outfit with price tag in plain view. There is Kerry (not a hunter) pretending to be a hunter and didn't even know how to handle the rifle. All of those cameras and no one got a picture of Kerry shooting. The other thing I remember that happened in Ohio is when Kerry grabbed John Edwards in his butt while Edwards was walking ahead of Kerry (who was leading who here??)What a guy!As for the remarks by Kerry in Arizona, obviously he only cares about himself. He proved that 35 years ago and proved it again in 2004."
5,"Great review by Jack Moore from Goshin, Indiana","Mr. Moore makes a great point in how John Kerry waited 7 months after the election before he released his academic records. All along we were led to believe that Kerry was the intellectual and was a standout student. The truth came out, but long after the election was over. How convenient!And Jack Moore also does an excellent job of exposing the 1 star Kerry supporter who claims that 5 star reviewers were posting minutes after his multiple posts. As Moore explains; ""how could he know what time it was, there is no meter[time stamp] here on the amazon boards.""Like John Kerry, this 1 star Kerry fan stumbles over his own words and shows the whole world just what a fool he really is.And thanks to the reviewer who mentioned that website www.wintersoldier.com. Very revealing!"
4,Book decent read - Amazon the real loser,"I have read parts of the book, but haven't finished it yet. It isn't particularly well written, but it is compelling.I will add my name to the long list of former Amazon customers. Your policy is ridiculous. Glad I shorted your stock at $55. Now I can watch it drop back to $10."
1,"""Served with..."" ???","The overwhelming majority of men who actually served with Kerry on his swift boat on a daily basis tell a story of his heroism and abilities as a commander that contradicts what these guys say - all of whom save one served on other boats, at other levels, or after Kerry's term as captain ended. Futher it's been shown that the doctor among them who claims to have treated Kerry didn't sign the medical report in question and others told different stories about Kerry's service at the time - UNTIL he became an anti-war spokesman upon returning home. This is a political hit piece - not the story of Kerry's service told by those who served beside him as claimed. O'Neill has been dogging Kerry for over 30 years because he disagreed about anti-war protests.I'll take the word of guys like Rev. Alston (who spoke at the Dem convention) - a man actually stood with Kerry under fire - over an obviously partisan attack. This book is hardly what it claims to be. Caveat emptor..."
1,Unfit for print,The credibilty of this book is now in question since Kerry's commander has retracted the statements he made in the book. A clever try to play dirty in politics (I despise this kind of behavior from either party).
1,"Um, right. Don't let the facts get in the way...","I was curious to note that many of the same vets speaking out against Kerry spoke out against McCain as well. They certainly did get around, didn't they? How would someone who didn't actually serve with Kerry know wounds were ""self-inflicted""? This book is just another attempt from the right to put Kerry's service in question to distract from the real fact that no one has yet to account for Bush being gone nearly a year during his guard service."
1,Stupid,"Okay I'm 15 and all Kerry-haters are just lame, okay? I mean, look at Bush. He's the dumbest guy in the world. So, the main thing that Kerry has going for him is this: He's NOT Bush. And thank God for that."
1,"I agree with BK, this five star reviewer is probably John Liar O'Neill","Because like O'Neill he thinks simply repeating a lie will convince people it's true.O'Neill could never provide factual support for his claims, and neither can his single fan.He's posted three more nonresponses to the very simple questions. Not counting doubles, of course.Total nonanswers to date:Twenty."
1,Unfit for Publication,"This book should be listed in the fiction section, since so much of it is untrue.I'm amazed at the (admittedly small) number of people who take these lies seriously."
2,Kerry Lie's,This is a good book to read if you want to follow-up on all his lie's he wrote. He can't even lie good enough to make himself look good!
1,"As a Marine, I am disgusted at liberals","As an active duty Marine soldier serving with the 80th Special Operations RECON Forces, I'd like to give out a loud ""HOO-YAAAH"" to John O'Neill in exposing John ""Hanoi"" Kerry.John Kerry is a traitor to our military and my beloved Marine Core, and we here at Paris Island Military Base all support Bush 110%. Here at the Base, we frequently hold discussions on John ONeill and his great book ""Unfit For America"" as we are washing eachother in the barracks shower, scrubbing eachothers hard manly bodies after an intense day of fighting in Irak...also, my drill sergant requrired we read ""Unfit"" so we can be better informed of John sKerry's traitorous activities. Thank you, John ONeill, from this proud devil-dog Marine Soldier. SIMPERS FI!!!!"
1,Turning The Corner,"We have lost 3,000 plus lives in the twin tower attacks on 9/11. Since then we have added 1,000 more American lives killed in combat (more will be added soon). We have succeeded in killing thousands of Iraqi's, and we are not yet done. America has turned the corner! We are getting things done! I am George W. Bush and I approve of this message."
5,Absolutely the truth!!!!,"I am thoroughly convinced that these honorable men are telling the truth after reading their book. How can any ""fairminded"" person disavow this??? ""Non-believers"", please stop being so partisan."
4,Decide for Yourself,"It occurred to me as I read this book that it will have a very strong effect on members of the military and veterans. They will be so deeply offended by the details of Kerry's campaigns for purple hearts. It is so specific in military detail and paints such a strong portrait of John Kerry as a narcissist who plays by his own rules.There's a good deal of credibility attached to this book. Too many named sources cannot be a ""front"" for the Bush campaign. These guys want their experiences recounted; they want us to know what they saw and did.I am a fairly well known Republican. Nobody put me up to this review. I sought out the book because I wanted to decide for myself. So should you.In spite of the mainstream media's hostility to this book, I note it is number 1 on the Amazon best seller list. Word of mouth is strong on this book; the internet bloggers are driving people to it."
5,Finally we hear from someone with a first hand account.,"I have been to most of the places discussed in ""Unfit for Command"" and found it brought back more than just a few memories of those times. I served at most of the commands discussed and knew several of the officers and men mentioned. My tour of duty at these very same sites was at a time 8 months after Kerry departed to begin spitting his anti-American, anti-US Military venom.When the Kerry-ites bash this piece as being just something put out by a pro-Bush lobby, they are being their usual myopic selves. John O'Neill, bless him, has been fighting this battle against Kerry for 33 or more years. It has nothing to do with politics. It is an attempt set the record straight, tell the true story and to keep a dishonorable person from becoming Commander-In-Chief of an armed forces that he designed to discredit for most of his life. I sincerely hope that this book succeeds in its quest."
1,"Kerry served, Daddy Bush pulled strings to W out of war","End of story!How anyone can even compare Bush's record to Kerry's! W. stayed home, did grass and snorted coke while Kerry did two tours of duty. Kerry was at least a man about his service, Bush remains a typical Republican wimp, all talk, no action (unless, of course it involves getting other people's kids killed)."
1,Should be in the political humor section,"This book is an absolute scream to read! It is the tale of one man's quest to take down a Patriot under the orders of two of America's most criminal leaders. Unfortunately, his orders are those of desperation and last resort. His flailing attempts, spanning 35 years, with not one victory to his name could make O'Neil a sympathetic character. Indeed, his inability to make peace with the horrorible truths of Vietnam paint him as a lost, perhaps redeemable, soul. Unfortunately, his lack of truth-telling and denial of reality make it clear that he is living in a dark, twilight world of political paybacks and fundamentalist delerium.The fantasmic scribblings of O'Neil coupled with the anti-Muslim and Catholic guidance of Corsi make this one tour-de-force of anti-veteran bile run rampant. While some might be fooled into thinking this is actual non-fiction, most will recognize it for the absurdist hypocracy of a political campaign in deperation that it is."
1,Bush Should Resign,"For getting over 1,000 of our troops slain in Iraq, for getting over 11,000 Iraqis killed in the war during the last year, and for lying all about weapons of mass destruction to get us all there in the first place.Now he has his Republican cronies attacking Kerry, to divert attention from his own sorry record on both the war and the economy. All from a guy who got preferential treatment to get into the National Guard to skip out on his own military service.Think of it, over 12,000 people dead simply because Bush wanted to settle a score with Saddam.Does anyone really believe the net four years will bring anything else other than more deaths, loss of jobs and poverty?"
1,"My ""republican filth"" will soil another store ...","According to my latest account data, I own (or gave as gifts) 75 items purchased here. I even took advantage of Amazon's generous payment gateway to contribute to the Red Cross after the September 11 attacks. Your site has an uncanny methodology for predicting products I am likely to purchase. But in this instance, common sense would have been a more appropriate technology to employ. Users of this site may be excited to get rid of the ""Republican Filth"" as I just read ... But your shareholders probably don't share that opinion. I am finished with amazon.com."
3,Wish We Could Know The Unvarnished Truth,"I don't know if this book is correct or not; at this point I'm lost in all the rhetoric. It is just too dizzying -- he was brave to go to Vietnam, could he have been rewarded all those medals falsely, etc., etc., etc.I do know that I do not like that Jane Fonda act Kerry pulled when he came back from the war. Our troops were in harm's way, and he made it worse for them, like she did, and that is just terrible.I disagree with Bush on just about everything except his understanding that we are in peril and we must be on the offensive against terrorism. I did not vote for him the first time, but he has my vote this time."
1,Don't believe everything you read...,"This book is a very disturbing exercise in political propaganda. After reading the book, I compared the vets' claims to fact-checked reports in newspapers such as the NY Times, Washington Post, and the Boston Globe. The vets' claims just don't hold up against the evidence. Whatever you think about his politics, John Kerry was a legitimate war hero, as his crewmates on his swiftboat will tell you again and again. So why are other vets trying to smear his name? I wish I knew the answer. And I sincerely hope, because I want to believe otherwise, that President Bush and his aides are not behind these vicious personal attacks."
5,Kerry is an embarassment to the Navy and US,"How disgusting that this charlatan brought so much disgrace to the US NAVY, VIETNAM VETS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I found the piece that Kerry actually shot a 12 year old Vietnemese kid and his grandfather in the back of the head, both civilians who were on a fishing boat.How disgusting!"
1,Full of lies. Should be filed under fiction.,Authors are bankrolled by the Bush family and Texas republicans. Do you really expect to find the truth here?
1,What a pile of crap.,"Right-wing horse dung, pure and simple. They must think the American people are idiots. The fact of the matter is that this election is a referendum on George W. Bush's four years in office, not whether it's possible for White House propagandists and longtime enemies to slander a veteran with lies and BS. Bill Clinton never actually dodged the draft; he legalistically worked his way around it, but he didn't dodge it. BUSH is a draft-dodger, literally and figuratively--he got his Daddy to sign him up in the Texas Air National Guard so he wouldn't run the risk of being drafted. That's draft-dodging.So get clear: Bush dodged the draft and Kerry went and fought. Period. Support Bush if you want to, but at least be honest about it. Supporting this kind of muckraking is dishonest, un-American, and, frankly, a fool's game, because no one but a fool could possibly believe or support this utter crap."
1,The basis for this book has been disproven,Now that the Military records have been released and disprove the allegations in this book I wonder why anyone would buy it?Before you waste your money research the backgrounds of the writer and his friends. They are Republicans funded by Republicans.Larry Thurlows statements are the basis for the most serious claims in this book.Now that Thurlow's own military records are released they contradict his words.You will find the same results for the other claims in this book; the military records do not support them and in most cases point to them as being lies.If you want to buy this book to fact check its contents you will get your monies worth.You should have better things to do with your time!
1,Who can believe these lies!,"Use your heads, people! Do you think the Navy gives out medals like candy? These people are obviously lying! The New York Times has a takedown of these gutter denizens:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/politics/campaign/20swift.htmlAnd by the way, they are financed by the Republicans and are connected to Karl Rove. The Bush campaign did the exact same thing, WITH THE EXACT SAME GUYS, against McCain in 2000!It's disgusting and intolerable. But typical of how Bush operates."
1,Speak out against this travesty of a book,This thinly veiled screed financed by extremist Republican backers of Bush attempts to dishonor the service of Senator John Kerry by soliciting statements from vets who weren't even in the boat with Kerry! Kerry's Commanding Officer retracted his statements and concedes that Kerry actually deserved the Bronze Star. That's consistent with his written recommendation three decades earlier. Now he has retracted his retraction. For a true account read the commentary by the man whose life he saved in The Wall Street Journal. I guess O'Neill and others fear that Kerry's pattern of heroism in Vietnam will reflect badly on Bush's pathetic performance in the National Guard. Shame on everyone associated with this book!
1,The author also worked for Nixon...,"Type in these authors' names and Richard Nixon and surprise! That's right, the head of Swift Boat Veterans for ""Truth"" also worked for Richard Nixon when he came back from the war as a veteran that promoted the war. Remember Nixon folks? He's the crook that had to RESIGN!"
1,"B.T. Cannon was right...five star reviewer blusters away,lol","Thank you for pointing out the obvious, B.T. Cannon. You wondered how long it would take for the single five star reviewer to try to bluster his way through your simple request with more dishonest reviews.Well, so far he's posted two, just minutes apart. I suppose we can expect more any minute.But he STILL can't manage to answer a very simple question. What's the matter, five stars, none of those hundreds of thousands of Internet links you know about contain a single date, source, or quote? You don't even know when or where your so-called video was made? Do you imagine we're all as dumb as your typical wingnut chatroom pals? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm?Shall we put up a little counting machine to see how many more phony reviews this five star guy will put up to try to cover the fact that...he has no facts?Okay, starting from B.T. Cannon's request:Two."
1,The Mission of George W. Bush,"We have lost 3,000 plus lives in the twin tower attacks on 9/11. Since then we have added 1,000 more American lives killed in combat. We have succeeded in killing thousands of Iraqis. My mission as president is to increase these numbers. I figure that if I'm president for four more years, we can increase the casualty rate, and decrease the job rate. My plan for middle class America is to send them all to Iraq. American jobs are being outsourced, therefore American's who want jobs must go to Iraq. This is my mission. America has turned the corner. We are getting things done. I am George W. Bush and I approve of this message."
1,I wouldn't read this book again,"Many of O'Neill's claims are way out there. He claims that 2 of Kerry's purple heart wounds were self-inflicted. I also found it very interesting that the author never even met Kerry during Vietnam, nor did any of the contributors ever even serve with him in Vietnam. The book relies very heavily on rumors and not on facts. I still don't understand how O'Neill makes all of these judgements about Kerry without any first hand knowledge of the events that occured during his military service."
1,Burn This Book,John F. Kerry went to Vietnam and received five medals for his heroic actions during wartime.George W. Bush went AWOL and received one dental exam for his cowardly desertion from the military during wartime.Do you want a hero or a coward as the 44th President of the U.S.? The choice is simple.
3,Why?,"This is an interesting read that highlights another troubled time in our country's history. I'm voting for Bush, but I don't see the point of nit-picking Kerry (or for that matter Bush) for his service to the county. Clearly he was in harms way, even if one of the purple hearts was questionable. Still the book is an entertaining read."
1,Does not fit the facts.,"Recent articles in the Washington Post, the New York Times, FactCheck.org, Media Matters, and several other major media outlets not only cast doubt on the veracity of this story, but they prove that it is total fiction. Today's statments by the commander of the Swift Boat that fought alongside Kerry's completely repute it. That Amazon sells this book as non-fiction is disgusting; it should influence your choice of booksellers."
1,Halliburton's money at work.,"John Kerry surved for his country. Bush went to The Texas Air National Guard and was suspended. So why believe people that were paid off by Halliburton or who ever, to say this terrible stuff about John F. Kerry. The true person that is ""Unfit for Command"" is George W. Bush."
1,Claims undocumented,"This book, while purported to be the truth, degenerates into nothing more than ""it's true because I say so."" Nothing is backed up with anything more than someone's version, and neither of the authors actually served with John Kerry. By besmirching this documented war hero, these people are tarnishing all vets, and all because Mr. Kerry came home from the war determined to stop it before more young men died. For shame, both of you authors. For shame.Besides, the writing is atrocious."
1,they weren't there,"After Iraq, Katrina, skyrocketing oil prices, mounting poverty, mounting deficits, etc., we know who's unfit.If you want the facts about the swift boat vets and John Kerry's military record, check this link:(...)"
3,Try the sample chapter and judge for yourself!,"If you want to make an informed judgment regarding whether or not to buy this book, just download or read the sample chapter (Chapter 3: ""The Purple Heart Hunter""). I'm not sure what Amazon thinks of links to outside sites, so I'll just recommend doing a google search on ""unfit command sample chapter"" - it works.Having read this free preview, I figure it's worth the $20 to find out what else is in the forthcoming book. The allegations are mind-blowing- and it's pretty clear that one of these groups (either the Kerry campaign or the SwiftVets) is attempting the biggest fraud since the ""Hitler diaries"" of the early 1980's..."
1,"Wow, five more non-answers from Five Stars ...BT Cannon and Amazon Fan were right !",Except for one thing. I count nine posts from ol' Happy Humphrey since November 2 - all with the same heading. LOL.So to add his five most recent nonanswers to the count:Seven.
5,THANK YOU SWIFT BOAT VETS!!!!,"Thank you swift boat veterans for having the guts to tell the truth. We (the American public) appreciate your service to our country, and we are amazed at your courage during the negative media frenzy against you. Don't worry about the pressure from the democratic party goons. Take heart in knowing that millions of Americans do believe you and we honor you!"
1,complete lies,"This book, and the similar tv commercial, is an outrage to the United States and to soldiers from the vietnam war. Bush, not Kerry, keeps his service record from being released. Prominent Republicans, such as John McCain have spoken out about the deceitfull lies of these ""Swift Boat Veterans""."
1,HOW SHAMEFUL,"Disagree with John Kerry on the issues if you want to, but don't lie about his war record. Following is a news item from August 19, just the latest in a series of reports showing that this book is, as John McCain said about an anti-Kerry ad featuring these individuals, ""dishonest and dishonorable"":Military Documents Contradict Kerry CriticWASHINGTON (AP) - A Vietnam veteran who claims Sen. John Kerry lied about being under fire during a Mekong Delta engagement that won Kerry a Bronze Star was under constant fire himself during the same skirmish, according to the man's own medal citation, a newspaper reported. The newly obtained records of Larry Thurlow show that he, like Kerry, won a Bronze Star in the engagement and that Thurlow's citation said he also was under attack, The Washington Post reported Thursday."
1,Irresponsible Garbage,"A manure spreader with a microphone and a typewriter, pretendingto participate in political discussion.It is long past time that we stuffed this ""crazy old aunt"" wing of our nation's character back in the attic. Letting these people out was irresponsible in the first place. Precisely the kind of fun that rich kids with no sense of responsibility or consequences have always enjoyed most, regardless of the damage done and suffering imposed on others.These are the same kind of people who led the South into startingthe American Civil War. Children of wealth - and their imitators - with an over-developed sense of entitlement and nobility pissing on the rest of us."
1,Turning The Corner,"We have lost 3,000 plus lives in the twin tower attacks on 9/11. Since then we have added 1,000 more American lives killed in combat (more will be added soon). We have succeeded in killing thousands of Iraqi's, and we are not yet done. America has turned the corner. We are getting things done. I am George W. Bush and I approve of this message."
1,Thoroughly discredited,"I read the book, and was shocked to find out the outright lies in it. You can see that for youself on these links:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/politics/campaign/20swift.htmlhttp://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/9455159.htm?1chttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-040821rood,1,663463,print.story?coll=chi-news-hedhttp://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid;=1692http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/politics/campaign/20swift.htmlhttp://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040821/LOCAL/40821006/1078/news&template;=printartI don't care what your party affiliation or who you are voting for, the facts are these lying veterans have disgraced their fellow veterans more than Kerry ever could have."
1,Unfit for Truth,"This has got to be one of the lowpoints of right wing writing in recent history. Bottom-feeders like Coulter or Hannity at least don't disguise their characters with polite manners. But this outright fabrication of insinuations, twisted facts and lies doesn't deserve the term ""dubious"". Because ""doubt"" is not what comes to mind if you ask yourself what purpose this shameful book is serving.Let's just hope it will be receding to oblivion once every Republican smear team has got one.And all this to save a man who didn't even serve in quiet Texas.. Shame on Regnery for publishing this garbage!"
1,Pack of Lies...,"Paid for by a pack of rats. More BS pulled out by the Republicans to try and prop up Chicken-Bush. Bottom line, Kerry put himself under fire and in danger. Bush ran from duty and never had to dodge a bullet!"
1,Mostly BS,"Interesting that recent media reports prove these guys did not serve with Kerry. Also, so his wounds were small. That's still bigger than any the chicken hawks like Bush got sitting at home drunk."
1,John O'Neill Owes Kerry for everything,"Did you ever notice how John O'Neill was so important when he was debating Kerry in the seventies but when Vietnam ended he suddenly disapeared? Kinda funny, huh? That's because John O'Neill could never make a political name for himself, so everytime Kerry made a significant accomplishment O'Neill was there to complain and get another fifteen minutes of fame. John O'Neill is nothing but an attention grabber who loves the fifteen minutes."
1,Biased and Sickening,"Only in an election year could such a biased, scurilous, and libelous book be published. W sits in office as a draft-dodger and John Kerry, a real war hero, gets dragged through the mud in this sickening book. Save your money"
1,C'Mon!,"Everyone should know, that this is just a stupid way to make money. You know this book is full of lies! John Kerry sure caused the war in Iraq, ang George Bush is the reason butterflies don't shoot out of a persons as*! Please, don't get this! Besides, the election is over anyway."
1,Please...this kind of junk should not be considered a book.,"It's clearly bought and paid for by the Republican CREEP, dirty tricks going back to the Nixon era and beyond. These ""authors"" praised Kerry on record, then magically changed their minds when Committee to Re-Elect the President lucre flashed in front of their faces.It's a terribly sad time in my beloved America. Not the first sad time, but it certainly is once again a horribly polarized nation which has lost almost all the respect it once had among its allies and enemies...thanks to the present administration. Yo, W, ain't it time to take another nap or something, maybe Rip Van Winkle-style this time around?DO NOT BUY THIS PROPAGANDA. IT ONLY PREACHES TO THE CHOIR ANYWAY. HOW ABOUT SOME REAL DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE?"
3,Read this book?,"It is amazing in this day and age how many people buy these books and actually never read them. I am talking from a neutral, moderate position here, and not foaming at the mouth from the left or right. Yet, spin people on both sides make comments like ""hey, this book is #1 on Amazon.com"" as a way to justify a position. Has our election process reached the point where people are more willing to buy a book than vote?"
4,Who tells the lies?,Very interesting review of several key topics that have to do with John Kerry. Either John Kerry is a liar or all of these men in the book are. Both cannot be right. After reading the book and listening to John Kerry try to explain it all I have to conclude that the book explains the facts in a consistant and truthful manner. John Kerry is unfit for command as the title suggests.
1,Fiction at its best.,"Yes, it's a compelling read, but ultimately as biased and over the top as Fahrenheit 9-11. If the men who served directly under Kerry didn't stand behind him, then there would be an argument to be had here. As we know in this sad age, sworn affidavits dont count for much. John Kerry volunteered for service, he was most certainly was under fire, and yet this book chooses to belittle that as if Kerry had somehow been in Vietnam and yet avoided serving. Don't waste your time nor your money."
1,A Sad Book Written by Pathetic Losers!,"It is sad to see on public display the political campaign of George Bush, which as he proved when running against John McCain in South Carolina, he will say anything no matter how disgusting and untrue to get what he wants. This book is just more garbage from the Republican Campaign Committee. Maybe these guys could write a book about the courageous service of George Bush in the Texas National Guard! Truly disappointing - read it with an open mind, but sad to say not worth the paper it is printed on!"
1,"Discredited, Cheap Right Wing Trash","In the first place, none of these people actually even served with Kerry (including the author, O'Neill). And the one person quoted in the book that actually did serve with Kerry, Gardner, wasn't even present during any of the incidents where Kerry got his medals. Also, many of the same people criticizing Kerry now had nothing butpraise towards him before the election.This is biased Republican crap at it's worse, financed by the same guy that ran a similar campaign against McCain in 2000. Of course, if Bush ever ran a campaign on the issues, it would be a wipeout for him.Someone should remind the Bush supporters that their guy didn't even serve, his father helped him get out of the service so who are they to talk.More telling, too, is the fact that Bush was a male cheeleader back in college (check it out). I think that alone safely puts to rest the idea the myth of Bush's machismo."
1,Boy am I sorry,"The book was a dollar and some change. Shipping was over $11.00. What gall to foist this on the unsuspecting public. What is that, 1000% MARK UP? I didn't contact them because if they had the character to charge that outlandish price, they would never do anything to resolve the matter. I didn't discover the setup until it was too late to cancel so I got stuck because I was too stupid or gullible."
5,Amazon Bias,"I have purchased from Amazon in the past but, from this day forward until they change their policy of Bush slamming and Kerry praising by allowing books to be reviewed unequally I will not purchase anything from Amazon."
5,"Just like the authors of all of these ""one star"" diatribes,","I have not read this book. However, it is not for lack of trying. You see, everywhere I go this book is SOLD OUT. Even on Amazon there is a 2-3 day wait. I will read this book eventually. Until I do, here are ""5 Stars"" to counteract the ""1 Star"" left by people who haven't purchased or read this book. For those who think these Veterans are liars, I ask you this: Why is it that Kerry's 4 months of service gives him a ""no questions allowed"" free pass and the SwiftVets for Truth (also VETERANS for those of you who missed it) combined YEARS of service are lies, lies, lies? Why aren't Kerry's entire military records released just as Bush's are? They certainly would clear up some questions. Just another example of the double standard of Liberal-itis (an inflamation of the brain caused by extreme ideas and an extreme avoidance of FACTS)."
1,GEORGE W. UNFIT TO COMMAND,"I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY GEORGE W. CAN'T JUST COME OUT OF THE CLOSET AND ADMIT THAT HE HAS MISLED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND BLEW UP THE TOWERS... KILLING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THE LIVES LOST IN THE TOWER ATTACKS PLUS THE LIVES LOST IN IRAQ ARE SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE. JOHN KERRY IS A MAN WHO WANT'S TO HELP THIS COUNTRY, NOT DESTROY IT. THE TERRORISTS CLEARLY HAD A THING FOR GEORGE W. BUSH (WHICH IS WHY THEY ATTACKED US). IF HE IS ELECTED AGAIN IT WILL BE AN INVITATION TO MORE DISASTER. THIS BOOK IS CLEARLY FICTIONAL AND IS A WEAK ATTEMPT BY THE BUSH CAMPAIGN TO WIN VOTES."
1,what a filthy bunch of trash bush style...,"i just finished this heap of highly paid for garbage by the desperate rnc to discredit someone because they are so afraid of losing votes in november! they just did-mine! that whole staff and family need to pay for their sins-in 2000 it was j mc cain, now j kerry, who next?? folks save your money give it better to an honest charity! i am appalled by this heap of pure unidulterated trash! shame on these highly paid traitors and double shame on rove and all that money funded by that shameful bush family!"
1,One star only because you can't have less.,"What a disturbing book full of lies. Clearly John O'Neil and his band of paid Bush backing fabricators are out to dismantle John Kerry's bid for the White House. It's funny how most of the guys quoted in this book were giving the opposite opinion as late as last year. This entire publication has been debunked as false and libelous. This book is only for those who have already swallowed the right-wing Kool-Aid. Anyone seeking the truth should look to the official Military records. This group of veterans are not only slandering Kerry but are slandering the entire United States Navy and all the other soldiers who served honorably. It is disgusting, dishonorable and completely false."
1,Doublethink,"Doublethink: To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies-all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. (George Orwell, ""1984"" pages 35, 176-177)The coward is the hero; the hero is the coward."
1,addendum,"It's official. Dobson, Falwell, and Robertson got together and voted this book in right after Revelation. Said Dobson, ""It's a great addition to any book of mythology..."""
5,Looking for some truth???,"I bought this book @ 3P and had it read within 5 hours!... could not put it down!!! I wish EVERYONE who is planning on voting in this upcoming election READS THIS BOOK!... Take away from it what you will... but, it is MIND-OPENING! Anyone who would vote for John F. Kerry after reading this book, is CRAZY!... unless, of course, they are Communists! If you saw 'Fahrenheit 9/11', or read any of the other anti-Bush books, you HAVE TO AT LEAST give this book a read too..."
3,Here is a suggestion for both Pro Kerry and Anti Kerry people.....,"We are upon a holiday weekend. But more importantly, we are faced with one of the worst natural tradgedies in American history. Rather than bash or hype Kerry, why not let it pass at least for awhile. I understand that both democrats and republicans are working together not seen since 911. Yeah, there are a few that have not shown much leadership, but overall, both groups are working together. I even saw Al Gore on Fox News no less volunteering his services to help the cause.I have contacted all the people that I know and advised to back off. If you agree with this, click yes, enjoy your holiday and offer any help to the people affected by Katrina.If you agree, click yes."
4,Interesting book,"I found this book to be quite interesting. I have no doubt some issues and memories in the book could be debated, but then, as we have seen, so could some of the memories of John Kerry. If only 50% of what is written by these men is the accurate account of what happened during and after the Vietnam war, I would not want him as president. The questions on his activity after the war concerns me much more then what he did during his tour. The book is worth the time and money to read."
1,"Hey, 10-year-old children!","That's what Bush thinks of you as. 10-year-old children.Boston Globe (9/3/04)NEW YORK -- White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said yesterday that President Bush views America as a ''10-year-old child"" in need of the sort of protection provided by a parent.''It struck me as I was speaking to people in Bangor, Maine, that this president sees America as we think about a 10-year-old child,"" Card said. ''I know as a parent I would sacrifice all for my children.""Come to think of it, I agree. Based on the reviews you moron conservatives have written, whining like crybabies about Amazon, I'd definitely concur that Bush's followers all have the intellect of 10-year-olds."
1,Thank goodness for Intelligent...,"Liberals! It's astonishing how many simple-minded CONServatives there are, suspending any semblance of commonsense and plain old smarts, judging by the reviews of this book or Amazon's ""hands-off"" policy on it. Are there really that many Repubs (really not neccessary to prefix ""stupid"", is there?)Gotta give Foxnews credit, they give the marching orders, and here come the mindnumbing mindless from the right screaming ""Off with your heads, Amazon!"" with nary a thought or deliberation about what it is they're protesting! Astonishing, they cut off their noses to spite their faces! Or do they not think Amazon has allowed their side to speak their mind, what there is of it?"
1,Shameless,and these people claim the moral high ground?An AWOL president and five-time deferment granted VP question the valor of a volunteer who carries metal fragments in his body to this day?? Why are we even having this discussion? Classic Bushesque smear campaign - classic misdirection strategy. How close did Bush come to getting wounded on the bar stools of the Alabama campaign trail while AWOL from his national guard duty?I choose to believe those who served with Kerry over those with not so well hidden polictical agendas who did not.
1,Propaganda & Lies,This book should be carried in the FICTION section. It's so full of lies I'm astonished Senator Kerry hasn't sued for libel yet.
1,My purple heart isn't good enough for you now?,"I served in Vietnam in 1969, and saw combat several times. I have two purple hearts, both for fairly minor injuries. I have always been proud of my medals and my service.But now, according to the republicans, my medals shouldn't mean anything, because my combat injuries weren't ""big enough."" Huh?? I was among those who were spit upon when I returned, and now I feel like I'm being spit on again. Don't you realize what you're saying, in your attempt to get at Kerry? Do you realize you are besmirching all us veterans who thought we should be proud of our medals?Why don't you realize what you're writing? Do those folks wearing ""purple heart band-aids"" at the convention realize what they're really saying? I had been considering voting for Bush, but seeing the tack his campaign has decided on, now I'm not so sure."
1,"""90% of everything is showing up."" -woody allen","if kerry is ""unfit for command"" because of a less-than-exemplary war record, then wouldn't bush be even less fit for command due to not showing up in the first place? i'm a bleeding heart liberal through and through, but i acknowledge those rare times when the right has a legitimate point. this is not one of those times."
1,Amazon.com = 5 Stars,If all of you are so upset with Amazon... why do you continue to give them 5 stars?
3,What a book!,"This is the fairest book I could write. Yes, I made most of it up, but I am fair and balanced. I only report what I lied, you decide the truth. This is not a story about a fox and chickens. It is news, slanted the way I see it. Lying is good, if you believe it. The book is selling good, thank you 5-star reviewers, there's one born every minute, ummm, I mean, the reviews keep coming in, that's good, you're good, 5-star reviewers. Hang in there, it won't be long now until I succeed, that is, until we succeed in bringing the buck home, I mean, Bush home. Take care, now."
1,Another catastrophic success from Karl Rove!!!,"Stop freeping and get a life, children.Everyone already knows about the association between the administrayshun and the Slow Boat Monkeys for Throwing Excrement.Smells like teen desperation in here.Bush failed to protect the nation on 9/11. The captain goes down with the ship. End of story."
1,Book written for the brain dead,"People support Bush because they're frightened little children. They think Big Brother is going to protect them when he's the one that tells you to look at the rainbow in the sky while he's stabbing you in the back.I know John Kerry is no saint but anyone would be better than Bush.Vote for me! I talk like a baby, freeance peeance.Come on America! Wake up!!!"
1,Poor Supply Side Economics,The publishers aren't printing enough copies. Amazon sells out of products. Making money transcends polictical drive. Big Deal.
1,Three decade old lies,"O'Neill has been trying to discredit Kerry since the Nixon years. He failed back then, when people's memory of the war is fresh, and people know exactly what happened. Now that more than 3 decades has passed, O'Neill is trying to re-spin all the old lies to a new generation of people who were not there, and thus cannot refute him."
1,A book that can only be a lie.,"Senator Kerry is not responsible for the medals that he was awarded. But he is responsible for volunteering for what may have been the most dangerous duty in Vietnam. Unlike Shrub we know where Kerry served, and how he served. The timing of this book is such that it can only be a lie told simply to smear Kerry. And this kind of lie has been a Republican campaign tactic since Nixon lied his way into office in the 1950's."
1,"Lies, Lies, and Partisan Lies","This book is nothing more than an attempt by angry Republicans to protect Bush's vulnerable flank as a chicken hawk.John Kerry served honorably in Vietnam in one of the most dangerous jobs there, was highly decorated and then came back to tell America what a mistake it was making in a useless, unwinnable war that was costing billions of dollars and thousands of lives.Meanwhile, George Bush was hiding from military service by going AWOL from the National Guard. He wasted taxpayer money training him to fly planes and then missed his physical exams so that he wouldn't have to fly them. It helps when your daddy is a congressman and your grandpappy is a senator.If you want proof, look up Kerry's Naval records and W's Alabama and Texas Natl Guard records.O'Neill, a pawn of Karl Rove, is asking the famous Groucho Marx question: Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"
1,The odds are 9:1,"Ten surviving men actually served with Kerry on theSwift boat. Nine support him, one opposes him. Do the math. These ""eye witnesses"" were a combination of sort of near the action, to not quite near the action, to out of it entirely. (I have it on very good authority that George Bush actually bled while getting his teeth filled on base while surving in the National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War. Cheney was too scared to go to the dentist.)"
1,Conservative propaganda unfit for publication,Give me a break. The ignorance of 50% of this country is startling (kinda) and sad (very).....
1,I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!!!,"Ever eat a peanutbutter sandwich without butter????? It's awful! Also, I didn't know Bush had a beer named after him!!! Oh boy! I'm feeling dizzy!!!"
5,YES---Kerry was worthless in the Navy!,"This excellent book by John O'Neill reveals all the lies, cowardice, backstapping performed by John F. Kerry. From claiming a silver star and heroism from what was actually murder. From applying for purple hearts for minor actually self inflicted injuries and then claiming they were a result of enemy fire (not true. Kerry's own journals reveal that h there was no enemy fire during the time he was ""injured"") And then from his infamous speech and phony testimony in Washington, DC which caused POWs to be tortured to his pathetic performance on the Dick Cavett show where Kerry was literally booed off the stage by the audience.YES---Kerry was a worthless traitor. In another time, he would have been beheaded or burnt at the stake."
5,Great book ! Read and decide for yourself!,"I have read the book. I believe that the accounts that are given are true. If they are not then Mr. Kerry should open his records so we can decide for ourselves! Seems kinda dumb that most of the people that have left bad feedback have never even read the book! TRY TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LEAVE POLITICS OUT OF IT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF! Remember this is a free country, and we are entitled to an opinion! Just read the book. It is incredible of some of the thing's that happened over there! THANK YOU TO ALL OUR VETERANS! I have to believe it because Mr. Kerry will not sign the paper to release his records! This book makes for some great reading! I could not put it down till I was finished. This book has changed my vote this election year!I do agree that Amazon has really made a mistake and has not been fair to some other books that you could not leave a feedback! I will also boycott Amazon! Amazon, you should be ashamed!"
5,Sen. Kerry should be in trouble,I read this book in one sitting. It makes me very angry that the Swift Boat Officers (60 that were I witneses) are completely disregarded by maintream media. After reading this book there is no doubt Sen Kerry was not telling the truth. Did you ever notice in all of Sen Kerry's war photos there are no signs of his 3 wounds!
1,flip flop,"""Shortly after LTJR KERRY was informed that he had a man overboard, he immediately turned his boat around to assist the man in the water, who by this time was receiving sniper fire from the river banks. LTJR KERRY, from his exposed position on the bow of the boat, managed to pull LT RASSMAN aboard despite the painful wound in his right arm.""official Navy report, 23 March 1969George Elliott, who later became a swift boat liar"
1,"Read, but don't buy this book!","As Rood and other Vietnam veterans come forward, this book is beginning to unravel like a poorly woven Persian rug. The ""facts"" that other reviewers have praised, now appear to only have existed in the imaginations of John O'Neill and his co-author Corsi (who by the way, is no stranger to fantasy writing).I highly recommend that everyone read the book, even rabid Kerry fans. It demonstrates the depths to which some will go to promote a political agenda.But don't buy the book! (...). Borrow it from a friend or try to get one from the library. Shabby research and poor writing should not be rewarded."
1,Poor Research and Suspicious Motives,"Most of us who served in Viet Nam came back conflicted. The simple truth... We did the best we could in a dangerous and morally-challenging environment. Some of us were asked to do things both repugnant and illegal. Viet Nam ""truth"" has more shades of gray than I can identify.That said, the overall ""feel"" of this book doesn't jive with my memories. There are gross inconsistentcies and ""evidence"" that is at best hearsay. Many contributors were not in country at the same time as Kerry and there is no official documentary evidence to support the contributors' allegations. I would pass on this one."
1,RIGHTWING CONSERVATIVE SLANDER ABOUT JOHN KERRY!,"This is ridiculis there is know way he wasn't in vietnam because as most right wing freaks don't know his swift boat crew were at the democratic national convention, THEY SAYED HE WAS GREAT (and there)"" and bah oh my the little republicans(who support bush no offense to the ones who are voting for kerry)can say what they want it'll be a hugh pack of lies John e. O'Neill is wrong, EVERY COPY OF THIS BOOK IN EXISTANCE SHOULD BE BURNED AND THE AUTHOR PUT TO DEATH!(not that that will happen with bush in office but it should be done when kerry WINS!). KERRY IS GREAT!!"
1,Dont have to read it.,"These guys didn't even know Kerry. The men who served with Kerry say that this group is lying. John McCain called the ad,""Dishonest and dishonerable"". He should know, the Bush administration used the same tactics on him in 2000. Only 1 of the men actually served under Kerry. Retired Adm. Roy F. Hoffmann, chairman and co-founder of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, has even ""acknowledged he had no first-hand knowledge to discredit Kerry's claims to valor"". So, judge for yourself. It's true that I didn't read this book, but I don't think I have to, It's a false front, intended only to discredit a man who served our country in war, and is now poised to be the next president."
1,Another Right Wing Hatchet Job,"Neither Mr. Corsi or Mr. O'Neill knew John Kerry in Vietnam and yet they contend they are better able to judge Kerry's character than the brave men who served with Kerry IN HIS BOAT. The authors would have the reader dismiss the official Navy record and the eyewitness accounts of the men that served with Kerry IN HIS BOAT. Both authors have serious credibility problems and even some of the veterans quoted in the book have praised Kerry's military service as late as 1996. As Senator John McCain said about this group, they are ""dishonest and dishonorable."" This book is a new low in political dirty tricks and co-author O'Neill learned at the feet of the best at this sort of thing, Nixon and Coulson."
1,shameful,"This book is outrageously un-American. It is just a libel against a political adversary. A shameful attempt to discredit your opponent when you are left without intelligent and valid arguments. It is a cowardly act which does not reflect the courage, honesty and valour of American people."
1,Hypocritical!,"I understand one of the Swift Boat Veterans (Larry Thurlow) received the same medal John Kerry did, for the same mission for taking enemy fire. Why hasn't he given it back, if, as he now claims, there was no enemy fire?Don't believe a word these guys say! None of them were on the boat with Kerry or served under his command. And the things they've said elsewhere leave no doubt they're lying for partisan purposes."
1,Mostly discredited,"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth served in Vietnam, but none with Kerry. Kerry's commander has expressed regret for signing the affidavit. Rassmussen, the man whom Kerry saved, has discredited the allegations in this book, calling them ""a complete fabrication."" Also a fabrication is their invention of a new standard for awarding a purple heart --- the reality is that pretty much, if you get injured, you get one, case closed. John O'Neill, the author, worked for President Nixon. Spaeth, who is in charge of publicizing SBVFT, also handled the vile trashing of McCain's honorable war record in 2000 before the South Carolina primary.Just so you know some background before you read the book. There are some allegations about Cambodia that may be true, but hey....look at the comparison. Vietnam was hardly a party in Alabama."
1,"Kill, Kill, Kill","I for one am glad to see that Amazon has suspended their rules when it comes to this book. God I love politics!Anyway, the Swifties are fascist morons (who didn't even serve with Senator Kerry). Some of them were part of the Nixon administration's collection of goons and thugs.This book is of no value- it is state sponsored propoganda. George W Bush is the worst, most evil, most vile man ever to hold high office in this country.Kick the rats out.KERRY FOR PRESIDENT!"
1,Shamefully weak,Any first year law student (or paralegal for that matter) could pick apart the weakness in the purported arguments about Senator Kerry's honorable service. Don't waste the money on this drivel - watch the 10 cent version on Fox news - it's quicker.
5,Changed my view about Kerry,"When Unfit For Command and the Swift Boat Ads first came out, I quickly dismissed it as a smear tactic that is all too typical these days especially in election years. But when I saw how John Kerry reacted and how he tried to stop this book rather than address it, my opinion quickly changed.I also talked with some Vietnam Vets who also question John Kerry and are bitter about what he did after he left Vietnam.If Mr. Kerry is on the up and up, why not debate John O'Niel? Why not bring your Swift Boat buddies and go against the 200+ and have a hearty debate Mr. Kerry? And why not sign form 180 to show all of America the facts? Hmmmm?No instead, Kerry tries to block the book and attack. So as I asked myself the above questions my opinion of John Kerry quickly changed. I went out and bought this book and now recommend it to everyone I know. Mr. Kerry's actions have also caused me to change how I will vote in November. HINT: I won't be voting for John Kerry!"
2,Yay Bush Yay War I Hate Liberal Reds I Have Money GiveMeMore,"Unlike the 5-star reviewers below, I honestly read and investigated this book.The results of investigation?ALL THE 'SWIFT BOAT VETERANS FOR TRUTH' WERE DONATING MONEY TO THE BUSH CAMPAIGN BEFORE KERRY EVER ENTERED THE PICTURE!!!More like 'Swift Boat REPUBLICANS for Truth'!I gave it a two because I respect that, as soldiers, they went to Vietnam, killed people for, um, no reason, and are against someone... uhh... saying... you shouldn't... kill people......."
1,John Oneill is a NAMBLA member,"John Oneill is a card-carrying member of NAMBLA and was caught trying to arrange a meeting with a 12-year-old boy he met online....yup, a typical Republican alright!"
1,McCain and Kerry the world's biggest traitors,"That is what that book would have us believe. Men, who did not even serve on the same boat as Kerry, go against documents that have been in military record for thirty years, to attack the candidate. The fact is Kerry probably did exaggerate his purple hearts, but these men have no credibility and should not be believed. These men who attacked John McCain in the last election now turn to another War Hero, because our president did not go, and even went AWOL. This book is useless and should be considered humor if anything."
1,Veteran Boats Are Witnesses to Strife!,"This election campaign is obviousely run by mergers. President Bush plays with the fact that NOMINATIONS DON'T SPELL WEAKNESS!This economy of choice does not favor Bush at all due to the fact that LAW IS NOT RELEVENT for exponents of preliminary taxes!Sure Bush say's he will raise taxes and outsource more jobs, but what about Iraq? This is a very sensitive issue and needs to be dealt with swiftly.President Bush stated that he will ship the middle class americans to Iraq in order to outsourse more jobs. This apparently would help the ability to fight terrorism.BUT! WHY ON EARTH does President Bush want more casualties? How can he say that on national tv?????"
1,"Yes, Mr. Five Stars sure seems to agree he has no facts","My word, it is too funny watching Mr. Five Stars (I love that nickname!) sputter and sputter instead of producing dates, sources, and quotes to prove his claims.I agree he's proven he has no facts !I also agree he's just like John O'Neill on that score.Maybe he's a Swift Boat Liar in disguise."
1,Unfit For Publication,"It has been well-documented that this book, and the group behind it, are for anything but the truth. John McCain called the group ""dishonest and dishonorable""; why anyone would continue to praise it is beyond me."
1,It's getting dirty here!,"I will have to agree with many of reviewers who do not feel that ""Unfit for Command"" was truthful.But, I wholeheartedly disagree with ""For Kerry and Proud of It!""'s describing what I consider a wonderful book as trash. ""The Bamboo Chest"" is a book anyone from any side should read. How ""For Kerry and Proud of It!"" could denigrate such a book of historical and literary importance as ""The Bamboo Chest"" in a review section as this is deplorable! To write that Communism is the best government in the world, that takes the cake.I am an English teacher and Democrat and I am making ""The Bamboo Chest"" required for my next reading assignment.Please do not take all of us who do not agree with the information in ""Unfit for Command"" as maniacs."
4,What about the facts?,"This book has many documented facts. My recommendation is to read this book and then chase down some of the facts yourself by doing some research on the Internet if you require more convincing. The negative ""reviews"" here appear to be an attempt to keep facts from potential readers. I find it telling that those ""reviewers"" speak little of the book. It is also telling that the comments left by those folks are riddled with misspellings.The book is definitely worth a read. John Kerry wants to be the president of the United States. Get as much information as you can about him."
5,Fantastic Book.,Thank you for helping to expose John Kerry as the traitor that he is. This man hates america and only those who served with him can expose him for the liar that he is.
5,Undecided no more!,"Since John Kerry has been campaigning as a War Hero; I wanted to read this book to find out what those who served with him in the Swift Boats in Vietnam had to say. As an undecided voter, I thought it would help me make up my mind.I found the book well written and well documented. It should be read by every American especially those too young to recall that particular era in American History.These men, many of whom have medals like Kerry, make compelling case fir the reasons why they believe he is 'Unfit For Command. After reading all their well documented accounts I tend to agree with them. There are so many Vietnam Vets who present so much detail on what they say happened that they convinced me that they are telling the truth.However if these Vets' charges are not true; Kerry should refute them by releasing ALL his medical & military records so Americans can decide.I highly recommend that this book be read by every American regardless of their political leanings."
5,A definitive book on a pretender for President,"Simple. John Kerry is Unfit for Command. Every choreographed move this man has made in his quest to take the Presidency and deliver America into the hands of socialism has been planned. He will say anything, appear as anything, do anything, to accomplish his liberal socialist plan. God help America if this man does manage to steal the election. This book exposes all the moves Kerry makes toward his megalo-maniacal quest for power."
1,Swift Voat Veterans are Scared,"John Kerry elected to attend the Swift Boat assembly of unicorns lat month. Now I don't know how this assembled his acorns very well. But now let take a look at Bush who is now racing against time.President Bush, who left us an inspiring and emotional review below, may be off his rocker, but at least he understands that in order for us to get ahead and scare the terrorists, we must be killed in Iraq.Now this is quite obvious for those who believe in amnesty because I myself happen to be a veteran and also an emotional school girl.Now John E. O'neil thought that by writing this book he would come across the idea that he could vote on a boat. This did not make the excuse for initializing the hardware for elimination.I happen to agree with congressman Anderson with various perspectives in veteran submissions. However many orgasms on this planet survive only because Republicans can't seem to get erection. John Kerry would be the obvious solution."
5,Freedom of Speech,"Excellent book, it is about time that the wall around Kerry came down by his own words and his own deeds.It amazes me all of the Bush Bashing books you have released and sold and have never provided this service. Why does this book rate the service of having good men who served more than four months being slandered."
1,drivel and canards,"This book from the Swift Boat Republican Veterans reads like repetitive dichotomy, since many of the veterans who tell their story in the book have had nothing from dripping praise to lavish on John Kerry for the past thirty-five years. All of this said, this book - even if taken at face value - paints a picture of a man (Kerry) who is exceedingly best equipped to be Commander in Chief, in particular when compared to the Vietnam era military service of GW Bush, which amounts to two day coke binge in the Texas National Guard."
1,The Craziest Bunch of BS You'll Ever Read,"If you're looking to find out what John Kerry did in Vietnam, look elsewhere. This book is completely filled with lies and innacuracies; it should be reshelved with ""The Moon Landing Hoax"" and ""Bigfoot Revealed"" as a work of the politically insane. It just makes up stuff."
1,Lies,"this is all you need to know about Regnery Publishing, the poeple publishing this book:William Regnery II, an heir to the Regnery publishing fortune is alsoa leading advocate of white nationalism publishing and moving into anew line of business: match-making for ""heterosexual whites ofChristian cultural heritage.""In an appeal to potential investors titled ""Population is Destiny,""Regnery wrote that the Caucasian dating service would be no ordinarymoney-making opportunity, but a chance to ensure ""the survival of ourrace,"" which ""depends upon our people marrying, reproducing andparenting.""If you STILL want these poeple running our country, which WILL happen if W 'wins' again then god help you because I can't..."
1,Swift Boat Liers For Bush,I never thought I would live to see the day that a decorted veteran's record was used against him to the betterment of the political career of a draft dodger.
1,Unfit for Command? Please!,"If one takes a look at both Kerry's and Bush's records and placed them side by side, you will see Kerry is MORE qualified than the sore loser we have as president.This book is utter crap and will quickly fall way below the top 10 within a week's time. All it is is propoganda by people who personally don't know Kerry. More or less, they are Bush supporters. The book is utter crap and not recommended!"
1,Nothing but propaganda crap,"One of the many problems with every election year is that we get so many books like this one. Lots and lots of information from people to have first hand knowledge of John Kerry, but actually don't. This is worthless. Whether Kerry is elected or not, watch how this book will be available for less than $1 within a year."
1,Why do Republicans hate democracy?,"In a democracy, the President works for you. You hire him when you elect him. You watch him do the job. If he makes good decisions and serves your interests, you rehire him. If he doesn't, you fire him by voting for his opponent in the next election.Not every country works this way. In some countries, the commander in chief builds a propaganda apparatus that equates him with the military and the nation. If you object that he's making bad decisions and disserving the national interest, you're accused of weakening the nation, undermining its security, sabotaging the commander in chief, and serving a foreign power-the very charges Zell Miller leveled last night against Bush's critics.Are you prepared to become one of those countries?"
1,"You're not wanted, Anthony Fenton","Beat it, Anthony Fenton, get the hell outta dodge. Go support your lying AWOL coward, you sick traitor. Do you think anyone cares if you, and the rest of your sad, treasonous, unAmerican ilk are here defiling Amazon? Go infest some other site, and don't let the door hit your pockmarked, weak, panic-filled ass on the way out.Filth."
1,What a piece of crap!,"This book,in my opinion, is nothing but outwages slanderous lies. To attack a war hero in this way is unamerican. Mr Kerry went to war, he served this great nation with courage and patriotism, which is much more than I can say about President Bush. John Oneill should be ashamed of himself for spewing such garbage. Mr Oneil, on the request of President Nixon went after Mr Kerry in the 1970s and to his sangruine was ridiculed by Kerry on the Dick Cavet Show. It seems that Mr Oneil is a scorned individual and has chosen to attack a war hero again. Same, Same, Same on you and yours..."
1,Should be in the fiction category,Every claim in this book has been disproved. Suppose you wanted to investigate an incident that happened about 30 years ago. Would you want to interview eyewitnesses to the incident (Kerry's crew) or the people in the same town who may have heard about the incident maybe even second or third hand (Swift Boat Veterans for Bush)? Would you go out of your way NOT to interview eyewitnesses? This is just what happened in this book.
1,What's in it for the liars?,"If you want facts, try mediamatters.org. If you want a bunch of lies, try this book. How can amazon, in good conscience, even sell this stuff without a big fat propaganda sticker on its cover? I doubt that amazon will publish this review, since I've referred to a website, but sorry, that's where you can find the best refutation of the constellation of falsehood on which this book is constructed."
3,Patriotism,"""Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."" Samuel Johnson,April 7, 1775, Boswell: Life"
1,not fit for reading,"This book is full of documented lies and misleading information and is not fit for reading by reasonable americans. No matter what your thoughts about Kerry as a candidate , his service is beyond reproach. To suggest that he self inflicted wounds for which he got purple hearts is bordering on psychotic. Mr O'Neill clearly has an agenda which would be better served by truthtelling, not lies and deceit."
1,Don't waste your money on lies,"This is a bunch of lies told by men who didn't serve on the same boat with Kerry, many of whom were not even in Vietnam at the same time as Kerry. Their statements have been contradicted both by themselves and by the military's records. They have documented ties to George W. Bush, so they can't be relied on to be objective in any way. Also, their publisher is not a mainstream publisher and most, if not all, of what he publishes is highly questionable."
1,Crack Boat Veterans are Liars,"Don't waste your money on this pack of lies. President Bush has already said that he does not believe that John Kerry lied about the details of his military experiences. President Bush also said that John Kerry had a lot to be proud of (about his military record). This is just an attempt to spread lies about John Kerry and to keep him out of the White House. John Kerry is a hero. All the boys that went to Vietnam are heros. Not only is this book packed with lies, it is also BORING. I kept falling asleep every few paragraphs. Save your money! Spend it on something that is actually worth something of value.Jac"
5,Sarah Peters,"Sarah,""Can American's be that easily herded like sheep as to believe anything in print or on T.V.?""I totally agree! That is why I have a big problem (and so should you based on your own statements in your review) with ""Far... 9/11."" Everyone has a ""free speech"" right to express! However, liberals have never taken any ""offense"" to ""Far... 9/11"" yet they totally denounce this book. I have seen the movie and I have read this book, and based on my own intellect the score is Movie:0 This book: 100. Any questions? Or is every liberal going to follow their false leader in denying the facts or worse yet, changing their opinions and values based on the ""current polls""?"
3,"After reading one star reviews, I bought the book!","I have decided that any book that has this many 1 star reviews must be shaking somebody up and that excites me. I have only read the first three chapters and browsed through the rest. I can only say that none of what the one star reviewer (s) have posted here is true so obviously they haven't read the book, are lying or both. My best advice is to do as I have done, buy it, read it and judge for yourself.I will post another review after I finish reading this book. Obviously, you can post more than once. Look at all the reviews by the same 1 star reviewer.I also agree with Buddy Roberts. He makes a valid point. We shouldn't be debating books this weekend. Thus I have declined to go beyond this point."
1,The people who didn't really serve with him speak.,"So the people who did really serve with Kerry are the ones in the ads and with him supporting his campaign, and the people who wrote this book weren't with him. And they do think George Bush is somehow qualified to be President. Based on his non-service in the Alabama National Guard? Go figure."
5,How hypocritical these whining critics are!,"Doug Cramer has a cheek attacking O'Neill for his disloyalty to his ""brother"" Kerry. Where was Cramer (or Kerry's Democrat toadies) when Kerry accused his ""band of brothers"" of being war criminals? Kerry's Communist buddies (with whom he cavorted) used this as an excuse to torture captured American soldiers.Why any American would vote for this treasonous flip-flopper is beyond me."
5,Mr. Flip Flop showcased here,Kerry says he wants to debate Bush? I'd love to see him debate John O'Niel a few times on national tv. I caught the old debate from 1971 on the Dick Cavett show. I think those who enjoyed this book would love to see an O'Niel-Kerry debate today.Loved the book. It shows the guilt and the demon that John Kerry's carries with him today. It also shows the side of John Kerry that he and the democrats hope you'll never find out.Great book. Thank you Mr. O'Niel.
5,Every American should read this book,"A new bombshell book written by the man who took over John Kerry's Swift Boat charges: Two of John Kerry's three Purple Heart decorations (#1 and #3) resulted from self-inflicted wounds, not suffered under enemy fire. The startling Purple Heart accusations, outlined in detail for the first time, are found in UNFIT FOR COMMAND, Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry. And that's just the beginning. Anyway, I recommend another book The Power of Positive Habits by Dan Robey for those who seek positive changes in their lives."
2,Why now?,"Why wasn't this book published in 2003? Or why wasn't it saved for next yr? It is because in advertsing timing is everything and the timing was right for this advertising campaign for the president.I just read the book and it was pretty interesting in parts and it does make me wonder some things about Sen. Kerry. But I am troubled by the fact that none of these men served with Kerry in Vietnam, and I am very troubled by the fact that it's a direct attack on a man and not something aimed at getting to the truth (even the critical books by folks like Clarke and Woodward were mostly objective in their views). Shame on this Regnery Press who published this. You can see why it wasn't publihed by anyone you've ever heard of."
5,YES--Kerry is guilty as sin. Facts are incontrovertible,"Aside from this well documented book, you can also go to wintersoldier.com for more facts about Kerry. Besides, Kerry has never refuted any of this.Unfit For Command has more than enough references to back up what is written in this book. I also recommend The Many Faces Of John Kerry to see how effective Kerry was in the senate for the last 20 years and see just what he had planned if he had become president. HINT: We would have been taxed to death and our healthcare, which is in shambles now (Thank you John Edwards) would be in far worse shape, especially for the elderly.In any event, the information in this book is incontrovertible."
1,"It's in print, so it must be true","Especially when co-authored by John Corsi, PhD in racism, bigotry, and mendacity . . .Hey, great job helping elect those Chickenhawks (bwak bwak bwak!).I'm especially impressed by the price of gasoline, the response to Katrina, the way Iraq's now a friendly Shiite neighbor to Iran (at the modest expense of 20,000 US casualties and several billion $s), and all that deficit spending.Keep up the good work, boys! We used to consider the Hoover administration to be the pits . . ."
1,Conservative BS,OK MAYBE JOHN KERRY DIDN'T EARN A PURPLE HEART...MAYBE HE DID LIE ABOUT SAVING HIS FELLOW SOLDIER...BUT GUESS WHAT??...HE WAS THERE IN VIETNAM SERVING HIS COUNTRY WHILE BUSH WAS HERE SIPPING ON COCKTAILS...AND AT LEAST HE DIDNT LIE TO A WHOLE COUNTRY AND TAKE THEM TO WAR FOR PERSONAL GAIN...BUT YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT...LETS NOT WORRY ABOUT THE MONKEY WE HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOW AND FOCUS ON KERRYS WAR HISTORY...HEY AT LEAST HE HAS WAR HISTORY...DO YOU THINK IT COMPARES TO THE PRESIDENTS GREAT TEXAS AIR NATIONAL GUARD CAREER...MAYBE
1,Big lies sell best,The fact that this book is the number one best seller demonstrates that Adolph Hitler's assertion (made in Mein Kampf) that people are more likely to believe big lies than little lies is correct.Virtually all the assertions made in the book have been thoroughly discretited. Any remaining ones are assertions made without proof.A complete refutation of the disproven lies in the book obviously cannot be provided here. But the following is just one example: There were three bronze stars awarded as a result of the action in which Kerry won the Bronze star. ALL THREE of the citiations state that there was gun fire.The claim that Kerry was in Cambodia has in no way been disproven either.The claims of the so-called Swift Boat Vetrans for Truth have the stink of Karl Rove all over them.I feel strongly enough about this message that I will post my real name:Roland Buck
1,Do Republicans even know how to read?,What in the world are conservative Republicans doing reading books? Shouldn't they be busy shoving their vibrators up in their poop-chute like their hero Bill OReilly?
1,a big NO for kerry,"kerry is unfit for president,NO to him,a big rebuke to him,He can,t even be allowed to be in the elections,the most inmoral candidate ever the U.S.A has had."
1,The most debunked book in recent history,Some of these guys praised Kerry when he ran for reelection in 1996. NONE of them served alongside Kerry. ALL those who did serve alongside Kerry stand by him and say he deserved his medals and is a war hero. What does this tell you? That these men want Bush to win and are willing to trash a fellow vet's war record with lies and misrepresentations. It's sad politics in this country can be brought so low.
1,unfit to write a book,"how unfortunate that over-exaggerated charges and narrow opinions are not subject to false advertising criminal chargesconsidering the depths to which some would violate the oaths they have taken and the loyalties that more honorable veterans would hold, politics is a poison that can apparently affect even the most courageous of us.i pity the authors and the puppet-masters who have pulled their emotional strings to manipulate their positions and their history to falsely accuse and dishonor one of their own.mccarthyism is still alive with this book, but time is the cure for everything, and this disease of neo-conservatism will also soon wash away."
5,Excellent! Don't Miss This One! A Must Read!,"I could not put the book down. It is excellent, well documented and an eye opener. The book captures the reader immediately.A must read for everyone!"
1,More lies by lying liars,This book has now been completely contradicted by all the available evidence as well as by the surviving men who actually served with Kerry. O'Neill and Corsi are proven liars with an agenda based on envy and their own misunderstanding of testimony given by Kerry over 30 years ago. The only thing this book proves conclusively is that conservatives are mindless droids - incapable of independant or critical thought - who will suck up any putrid garbage the right-wing propagandists toss in front of them.
1,This book is pure lie,The non-crazy wing of the republican party even says so. That's McCain and not Bush by the way. This is the same group that spread the word that McCain had adopted a black child in the south. Don't buy this book.
1,A Republican's Last Pathetic Stand Against Kerry,"Whether John Kerry deserves his purple hearts or not he would definitely be more fit for command than the man in office right now. How do I know? Simple. Look at Bush's record the republicans try to hide by blowing up Kerry's Vietnam faults. Yes Kerry only served four months, which is very short compared to the average year long tour. But where was Mr.President at this time? Well, no one really knows because he was AWOL. At least Kerry was present. The bottom line is that Bush can send troops overseas to fight for his own personal gains, but as for he himself serving in the military, he was simply too ignorant, scared, or both. Even if Kerry has lied to us about his honors in Vietnam, at least his lies haven't killed thousands. Republicans would love for you to soak all of the over exaggerated facts presented in this book, but what else would you expect from a political group that has ran out of ideas to use against Kerry."
3,Frank Burns goes to Washington,"I keep thinking of the M*A*S*H 4007 TV show as I read the swift boat section of the book (Frank Burns once put in for a purple heart because of a shell fragment in his eye, turned out to be an egg shell). Does that make Kerry a bad choice for President maybe, then again I have grown up learning that some of the actions of those people who go to war don't reflect who they are outside of war. I was leaning to Kerry at one point (I was a delegate for Joe L) but Kerry lost my vote in the books anti war section. No one who marches under an upside down flag should ever be president. After reading this book I read ""The New Soldier"" by Kerry at freekerrybook.com and it scared the heck out of me.""Unfit"" will get five stars from every Republican and a one star from every Democrat, I think it is more like a three. Not a great read if it is outside of its electoral context but not that bad either."
2,Mostly heresay seems like distilled political propaganda,"I'm left feeling like we ought to surge with our military back into South VietNam if half of what is said in this book could actually be true.I'm a registered Republican and personally see nothing wrong with people speaking out against the war like Jane Fonda did. If the war were won and she were proven wrong, perhaps I would feel differently.Instead, we later bailed on VietNam and the people who helped bring us to that decision sooner should all be viewed as heroes for daring to stand up to power and speak their minds.All of the Swiftboat Veterans did not serve on Kerry's swiftboat and the whole book reads like a cleverly disguised partisan political story to frighten the children.Reminds me a similar books about Bush and his young cocaine snorting days which got squashed and the author mysteriously died. I wonder if John E. O'Neill could make that story his next gripping novel.We learn to smell truth over time and this smells fishy to me."
4,Damning indictment of Kerry,"This book is a screaming indictment of Kerry's war and anti-war record - it just isn't much of a book. Only 200 pages, with no maps and not much research, it really isn't worth anything near the $27 list price. Tommy Franks' book costs the same, is 3 times longer, and has color photos and plenty of maps, for example. But it is a detailed and accurate account of Kerry's limited and undistinguished Navy service, using accounts of men who served with and near Kerry."
1,Liars lie and fools believe everything they read,"It's not about Shrub's inarticulate torture of the language or Kerry's rusty medal collection.It's about Faith Based Budgeting, Faith Based Foreign Policy, Faith Based War Planning, and a total disregard of dissenting expert opinion on every issue. After reading Clarke & O'Neill's (two Republicans who served under GOP administrations going back to Nixon) accounts of Bush cabinet meetings completely dismissing the terrorist threat and even after WTC focusing almost entirely on Saddam even to the extent of running the agitprop Office of Strategic Planning (thanks, LTC Kwiatkowski) to cook the intel, there is no basis for further debate."
1,Nothing but lies,This book has nothing but lies in it. It is co-written by a bigot and the other person has close ties to the Bush family. The people who had anything to do with this book should be ashamed of themselves. Big money is behind this book and the same big money is behind Bush. I am a Military Spouse and in my opinion Kerry served his country enough said.
1,Give me a break...he was under 25,"These are bunch of exaggerated and false accusations against John Kerry. For example, he attended a meeting in Washington DC where plans were made to assassinate prominent US senators...this is true...but what happened in the meeting? Every news article written about the meeting says that he was the one to stop the ferocious veterans against doing such things. Rest of the stories in this book are just like this, accusing John Kerry for things done by others, slandering John Kerry for merely being in a meeting or a location.As a side note, when John Kerry served in Vietnam he was under 25. How can you judge a sixty year old guy based on the actions and personality when he was 25???"
1,Lies by Bush supporters,"Oh, come on. No one can seriously believe anything in this book. Every major ""point"" in this polemic has been proven to be a fabrication by the right wing; funded by a Texas Bush supporter; promoted by Robert Novak whose son works for the publisher. Is there no depths that the right wing slime machine will not plumb. They even throw slop on themselves just to try to dishonor John Kerry. Has the Republican machine totally lost touch with the reality of right and wrong. These are the same people who throw the Ten Commandments in your face every time you turn around. Is there not something about ""thou shalt not commit perjury""?"
1,Not a great book for those with an education,"If you watch and love the Fox News Channel, than this book is a must. However if you are, I don't know, literate, than you might want to steer clear of this shameless attempt to discredit a war hero. As a Republican who believes that ""W"" as the IQ of a baked potato, I'm not exactly a huge fan of John Kerry, and I know there are plenty of issues on which to debate him. However, it sickens me to see the filth that this author tries to dig up all in the name of politics. A quick look at his bibliography confirms the obvious: His sources are biased enough to make Michael Moore look like Jim Lehrer and completely undermines his point. If you have a choice between reading this book and, say, getting a nail lodged in your knee, I'd pick the nail."
1,Veteran for Kerry,"After finishing this book I felt slightly sick. I served my country proud, and I believe John Kerry did also. I just can't imagine how I would handle this type of character assination if I was a public figure. How is it that a decorated soldier can be the target of such nonsense while his opponent is a man who did not honorably serve his country and spent most of his youth drinking and living off the fat of the land? It's a damn shame. I voted for Bush in the last election, I will not make that mistake again. I'm a veteran for Kerry."
1,"An interesting read, but does not seem to be credible...","I have to give it to these Swift Boat Veterans. They were so up on spying on John Kerry and waited for him to run for President then, come out with their stories, seems a little fishy right? That's because it is, it's a total joke. Unfortunately over half of america bought into it. The book gave some pointers about those who barely knew him and disliked him very much but were never really around when the action happened. So let me get this straight, the group was still conspiring in secret for 40 years, then all of a sudden resurrected when John Kerry ran for president, what's the deal with that? Had John Kerry never ran for president, would we even know about the Swift Boat Veterans?"
1,"were they lying then, or now?","the book is an intriguing read - fast paced and decently written. unfortunately, it immediately seems to devolve into a diatribe based on innuendo or second-hand rumor. Most disturbingly, in the past week, it seems that many of the points made by the author(s) are either wrong at best or flat-out lies at worst.And it seems like a pattern - not just one lie or one liar, but multiple lies and multiple liars.The stories in this book are utterly different from the author(s) earlier statements in the 1970's, and different from the official records.Claims that the records are wrong seem to fall flat since the claim is being made by someone who either lied then.... or is lying now.I suggest reading the book in a library as the cost seems exorbitant for a piece of demonstrably untrue propaganda-fiction."
1,"Lies, lies, and more lies","How many times do the authors of this book have to have their statements proven to be lies? The same people quoted in this book were the ones who, back in the 60s and in '96, were effusive in their praise of Mr. Kerry's heroism, honor, and decency.These men are the polar opposite. They are cowards, liars, and have no honor whatsoever.Frankly, this book ought to be filed as ""fiction"" -- and Mr. Kerry probably has a case for a libel lawsuit here."
1,My purple hearts aren't good enough for you now?,"I served in Vietnam in 1969, and saw combat several times. I have two purple hearts, both for fairly minor injuries. I have always been proud of my medals and my service.But now, according to the republicans, my medals shouldn't mean anything, because my combat injuries weren't ""big enough."" Huh?? I was among those who were spit upon when I returned, and now I feel like I'm being spit on again. Don't you realize what you're saying, in your attempt to get at Kerry? Do you realize you are besmirching all us veterans who thought we should be proud of our medals?Why don't you realize what you're writing? Do those folks wearing ""purple heart band-aids"" at the convention realize what they're really saying? I had been considering voting for Bush, but seeing the tack his campaign has decided on, now I'm not so sure."
1,the bush people have sunk to a new low,"the ""book"" is 180 pages and full of garbage thrown at a guy who actually served in vietnam as opposed to hiding like bush and cheney did. dont let these scumbags get away with these lies - vote them out of office in november."
1,Lies,"The Washington Post has proved these claims false. Their stories are now changing, people are coming forward and no one can stick to their claims. This is typical of Liars, I guess it makes sense they are bush supporters."
1,Truth about O'neil,"A few facts about the ""author"" of this book John E. O'Niell. John O'Niell has been attacking John Kerry for thirty years now. He first sparred with Kerry after being encouraged by CHARLES COLSON (a top Nixon aid who went to prison for crimes committed during the Watergate scandal). John Kerry had recently found his way on to President Nixon's infamous ""Enemies List."" President Nixon and Charles Colson saw O'Niell as the perfect person to attempt to discredit Kerry. The man began attacking Kerry, after being encouraged to do so by one of the people who WENT TO JAIL during the WATERGATE scandal."
1,"Fake ""veterans"" lie about Kerry","In a cruel mockery aimed at making our nations veterans look like fools,these fake ""veterans"" tell lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie about Kerry,hoping to fool those gullible enough to believe anything.This book-which is nothing but lies,rumours and false facts-is written by a bunch of Republicans passing themselves off as ""veterans"",and contains nothing but hatred and bigotry agianst a human being who only wants to make America better.Don't waste your money on this Book of Hatred and Lies-get something truthful instead.If you've already bought this book,you can watch your money going to benefit the favorite ""charities' of these fake veterans-Big Oil and Tobacco companies."
1,Garbage written by a man with a 33 year old grudge,"Unfit for Command is the product of Brooklyn Bridge salesmanship by the rightwing zealout hired by Nixon to attack Kerry 33 years ago when Kerry had the courage to speak out against the Vietnam War. John O'Neill who lost the debate with Kerry on Dick Cavett in 1971 is back with a 33-year-old grudge. He scraped some fellow rightwing veterans together who never knew Kerry to spread the lies about him we see here in this book and on their $200,000+ TV commercials. They have one goal: to tear down the man who would be our greatest president ever: John Kerry.Please don't waste your hard earned money on this junk. Instead buy a book that contains a first hand account of Kerry in Vietnam: Tour of Duty.Only 7 more weeks until Kerry becomes our next President and we will have a positive future in spite of those on the far right who want to tear down our next President and leave our future to Cheney and Haliburton."
1,Another Regnery product,"Regnery Publishing is to book publishing what the National Enquirer is to journalism. One should therefore only expect from this book what the publisher typically publishes... I look forward to the next Regnery book on John Kerry, exposing his campaign staff as aliens from an undiscovered planet."
1,NOW HEAR THIS!!,"What kind of a soldier would ever attack another vet's service? One that's a sneeky little rat, that kind. How can you get 250 other medal winners to testify to a lie? Easy, if most never served with him, needed money, and were liars in the first place. If these were any kind of brothers in arms, they wouldn't have been making these charges to begin with. There's an unspoken bond between those who wore the uniform, and you don't go around ratting on the guys who watch your back.A better question would be, what kind of a political campaign has the gaul to attack a man's service to begin with? Easy: a campaign run by a guy who never even served himself and weasled out of it by hiding in the National Guard. Everyone knows about the bond between brothers in arms. Of course, Bush and his Republican hit squad would never know about that since most of these ""men"" managed to weasle out of their military commitment in the first place."
1,"Sad, sad, sad","Central to Stalinist proganda is the idea of projecting your own faults onto your enemies. Here we have a clear case of a president who first joined the Air National Guard, jumping the line, to escape being drafted to Vietnam. Not content with that, he then went awol for a year. Now, his opponent in the presidential campaign did not only go to Vietnam, he also served with distinction.The truth is a valuable commodity, and should not be squandered; besides, the electorate can not be expected to cope well with the truth: the gospel according to Rove.This book is a brilliant piece of selective data and remarkably good memories from an event over thirty years past.The commanding admiral at the time claims the book is full of lies, Tommy Franks claims the book has no truth, even the White House has to, officially, acknowledge that the book is not true. Still, sad little people that has too clutch at straws to support their beliefs like this book. Sad, sad, sad."
1,An insult to all veterans,"The first thing I thought of, in reading through this book, was: Is this what our current soldiers have to look forward to? People later second-guessing the decisions behind their medals for political reasons? The careful reader will note that the ""witnesses"" in this book did not work directly with John Kerry. Why not learn about Kerry's war record from an actual historian, someone trained to interview people, examine sources, and discern the truth? Check out ""Tour of Duty,"" by Douglas Brinkley, the historian who succeeded Stephen Ambrose as head of the Eisenhower Center in New Orleans. Another tip: ""Unfit"" is a quickie, thrown-together book, so slim that it can be read at Costco in the time it takes your family to shop. If you want to have a look at it, do so at the store; don't give these veteran-bashers your financial support!"
1,An Honestly Documented Piece of Manure,"Books by the same authors: We Served with Hitler, We Served with Saddam, We Served with Bin Laden, We Served with Napoleon, We Served with Custer, We Served with Stalin, We Served with Macbeth, We Served with Darth Vader, We Served with Caligula, George Washington Was a Lying Traitor, Teddy Roosevelt Was a Lying Traitor, Ulysses Grant Was a Lying Traitor, Andrew Jackson Was a Lying Traitor, Dwight Eisenhower Was a Lying Traitor, John F. Kennedy Was a Lying Traitor"
5,The Light of Truth Exposes Kerry,An enormous debt of gratitude is owed to these brave and heroic men (the Swifties) for telling us and showing us John Kerry's true colors!! THANKS!! The book is an easy yet captivating read. Everyone must read this before election day! We need a commander-in-chief that we can depend on...the Swifties make it obvious that Kerry is truly UNFIT FOR COMMAND
5,Makes for a great Christmas Present...,I will be sending this book out as a gift to everyone on my X-Mas list along with Stolen Honor and/or FahrenHYPE 911. Great stocking stuffers aye?
1,"As a longstanding Republican,","I, too, would like to lament how this campaign has been conducted. Back in the 1980's, we used to be able to winsquarely on the issues. Since the Bush family have taken control of the party, though, it has all been attack politicsat their worst.Having read this book, most of it anyway, I can say that most of the policies are both malicious and unfounded.Richard Nixon had Charles Colson check out Kerry back in 1971, back when Kerry was his enemy, and foundnothing. Rest assured, if something had been found, it would have been used at the time to discredit him. Had anyof the men quoted in this book actually served with him, then they might have something new, but most weren't evenin the service at the same time he was (including O'Neil).It is sad that it has come to this. The Bush campaign is forced into one constant attack upon a thirty year old servicerecord in order to detract attention from it's own poor record in office. As I said, very sad."
2,"""dishonest and dishonorable""","John McCain has called the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and their attacks ""dishonest and dishonorable.""If you want to measure John Kerry's service, look at the men who served under his command. They support him, and stood with him at the Democratic convention."
1,question,This is not a review. I can't find another way to contact Amazon about this. Why are there no customer reviews posted for this book?
1,"Lies, Lies and more Lies",I was republican up until reading this book and the whole swift boat garbage in general. I like how a party that claims to be American beats the crap out of a guy who served (on one of the most dangerous missions in the war) while worshipping a war dodger.
1,"didn't read it, don't plan to, it's all lies.","This is the worst kind of libel anyone could level at anyone else. I didn't read it, don't plan to as it's all lies, and furthermore; let's get back to issues folks. Enough said.If you want more casualties-vote Bush-Cheney."
5,The Truth Shall Prevail!,A great book. Everyone should order this book and get the true facts about what John Kerry is really like as judged by the peoplewho really knew him.
1,George Bush is a disgrace to Texas,"One guy serves and is a patriot, the other guy's daddy pull some strings and gets him out of service. The closest thing George Bush ever got to a wound during Nam was getting his dental fillings. Now his wealsey little crew wants to attack the service record of a real patriot. Well, I'm telling you all, any real Texan would have been in that fight, too, in fact, we would have been on the front lines, not hiding out and going AWOL at the National Guard like some wimp. You can bet someone would be writing a book about old George, if they could have ever found anyone that ever served with him."
5,John Kerry betrayed us!,"Unfit for Command reveals the real truth about the so-called Vietnam war hero John Kerry. I find it hard to believe that during a four month period in Vietnam, Hanoi John Kerry was some how able to earn Silver and Bronze Stars and three purple hearts. In his book John O'Neill makes compelling arguments why the Senator is no war hero (except to the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese). I am a proud Vietnam Veteran who felt betrayed when John Kerry portrayed us all as war criminals! Read Unfit for Command and understand why so many Vietnam Veterans have such a great disdain for the Senator!"
5,"Excellent, Riveting, and completely true!","John Kerry has not only admitted to war crimes, he is quite possibly the worst presidential candidate the girly men have ever propped up for the position.This guy is nuttier than gore! He's good for a lot of laughs though. Please buy this book and since the dems are using this review for a spouting forum, let's get our .02 in also.Remember 10 out or 10 terrorists surveyed say: Vote Kerry!"
1,Goes beyond being partisan,"If you like your politics mixed with a heavy helping of fairy tales, you'll love this book. If you're interested in anything approaching fact, then stand far back.Jerome Corsi is well known for his biggoted, racist, foul-mouthed editorials. Here he gangs up with O'Neill to display all the skill of a third grader writing about their experiences at summer camp. Yes, they lob every poorly-constructed argument possible in Kerry's direction. Some of their underhanded pitches might even look like hits -- so long as you don't bother to check any other source.This book takes political rhetoric to the fine stage acheived by ""you momma."""
1,Doesn't live up to it's reputation,"For a short book, it doesn't even have much content in it and some of the charges in it (Kerry's use of military vehicles to go to Saigon for a ""good time"" for instance) are frankly pretty petty. O'Neil speaks as if he knew Kerry personally, yet never even met him until their appearances together on the Dick Cavett show. The same can be said for the other vets in this book, most of whom weren't even in the service at the same time as Kerry, just simply didn't like his postwar activities. Odd that this book has even become a big deal considering that Bush never even served in Viet Nam himself.For an unbiased, frank look at Kerry's service, read ""Tour of Duty,"" or, better yet see ""Going Upriver: the Long War of John Kerry,"" a documentary based on Kerry's Swift Boat service and his anti-Viet Nam activities afterwards. Neither are wholly flattering either, yet were at least created without any political bias."
5,DON'T VOTE FOR THIS ANTI-AMERICAN PIG,"John Fraud Kerry has no honesty, integrity, or morals. What a lying,scumbag,loser..........This book tells the real story of this piece of S. I was amazed at the depths this guy would (and will) stoop to, to get elected Preident of the greatest nation in the history of mankind. This is actually very scary that this guy is undermining our war efforts today in Iraq, just as he did during Viet Nam. Read this book and dedcide for yourself. ALL proceeds of this book are going to charity."
5,Patriot,"I can't see how anybody could read this book and still vote for J. Kerry. In fact I wonder if money keeps him out of jail. Great book , easy read. Thank John O'Neill and everyone who contributed to this project for a job well done."
1,Get out the tinfoil,"This book has been a topic of debate from its inception, but nearly a decade has passed and history has revealed the sad truth. The fact is that Corsi is either a fraud, an insane paranoid, or both. He has since joined up with the 9/11 conspiracy theorists and the birther crowd. He is a frequent guest on ""Coast to Coast"", the midnight radio show for the UFO and Bigfoot whacko bunch. Anything published with his name on it simply cannot be considered credible. I'm sure even space aliens with big feet won't read this stuff.Get out the tinfoil and start making the hats."
1,An unfair hatchet job on an honorable man!,"This book really deserves no comment, but to let it pass without comment would give it more credit and make it seem legitmate. I would suggest that anyone who gives this book any credence to look at the past work of the authors and also follow the money trail. The main backers of this book are also responsible for sliming John McCain when he ran against Bush in 2000. If you are taken in by this stuff, then I suppose you are not a very critical minded or questioning person. So enjoy it, as you wallow in the lies and slime!"
1,Sadness,"This is a sad book written by men who didn't serve with John Kerry. Why was it written? To answer Michael Moore? That was truth hidden by hype. This is just incorrect and wrong. Either way, I just hope against hope that the American people will not base their vote on trash like this. Anti Bush, Anti Kerry- look, just form a well rounded opinion by looking at the issues, not garbage like this."
5,Naval Officer's view,"Knowing the Navy award and commendation system gave me a particular insight into this book, and into Kerry's naval career. I have read all the accusations and defenses, and this book stands as authoritative and highly (although not completely) accurate. No one should cast a vote without reading this book."
5,Kerry is a traitor!!!,"This book is a fast read. Kerry is a misguided elitist who becuase of the coincidence of his J. F. K. initials was convinced that he was preordained to become the president. If only his parents had named him Martin Luther Kerry. Kerry is man without courage, integrity, wisdom, or honesty. He is driven by the love of power and was indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of those who were left behind and slaughtered when the US fled Viet Nam. I was a veteran stationed in Hawaii during the Viet Nam war, I remember John Kerry and unfortunately, I was persuaded at the time to believe that the untr4ue atrocities he claimed were being committed by the US forces were true. Kerry should be tried, convicted for treason and then executed. Thank God, he was defeated. Let us get him out of the Senate adn never let him on the national stage ever again. His actions are a national shame."
5,Where is the rationale?,"What rational person could possibly take this one and only one star reviewer seriously. Here we have the fake Heather from MI and Loyd (sic) has changed to a new alias American Patriot.HINT: Heather and American Patriot=same person!Other reviewers indicated that, now we all know that it is undeniably true. It's a good thing it's not Sunday nite, you would be busy watching Desperate Housewives. And by the way, your reviews and constant alias rotation indicates that you are very desperate!Nice try. But like John Kerry's failed campaign, just not even close to being good enough."
1,Unfit to Write,"I found it interesting this book was published by the leading conservative publisher in America. While that is the fact I am always ready to see both sides of every issue, including and especially about the lives of those who wish to lead our country. But this book was so filled with transparent attempts to smear Kerry by soft money Republicans I can only compare it to that other right wing smear attempt, the 527 commercial with swift boat people who said they served with Kerry, but as it turns out that ment they were in the same country and on the same river as Kerry, not in his boat. (...)"
1,Snake Oil Salesmen,"I'm not on either side in this political debate but frankly, fit or unfit, anyone who is willing to plunk down between 20 and 30 dollars for a propaganda/profit driven book of less than 200 pages of rather boring, poorly written text deserves whatever they get. As a wise man once said, there's a sucker born every minute. Wait till it's in the library. It won't accomplish much more or much less to read it then."
1,Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Joh,"Thank God for the Washington Post report today (Aug. 19)discrediting the Larry Thurlow's testimony against J.Kerry's wartime record regarding events leading to his Bronze Star award.What we have here is a bunch of loser Vietnam Vets trying to cash in on a book at the expense of an honorable and decorated war hero.Shame on you!!! Swift Boat Veteran of liars.Mark my word... As more lies from this book get exposed, this book will be headed for the $1 store before the Republican National Convention in less than 2 weeks. Therefore, save your $$$, this book will be woth $1 in less then 2 weeks.If you've already bought the book, ask John O'Neill for a refund."
1,Simply The Fiction ! ! !,"It's simply pathetic that people could not tell the plain truth from the blatant slanders contained in this book. To the people who deliberately twisted the facts, however, this is utterly a different story. How to find out the truth ? and why John E. O'Neill / Jerome R. Corsi had to manufacture such a book? If one had researched a bit, one would have reached his/her own conclusion. The question remains, why people from W. side are so negative? it seemed that the only thing they had been focusing upon was to defame John Kerry. Does any one have seen any concrete ideas they proposed about current domestic issues and international problems? In contrast, we see a very positive picture from Kerry/Edwards and their detailed, constructive plans for both our domestic issues and international problems. It is clear in conclusion, when people are losing, they resort to whatever it takes to try to keep themselves from losing."
1,Swift Boat Veterans for Truth?,"There is one simple problem with the book. In order for their story to be correct, the Department of Defense, the Navy and their own reports from Vietnam would have to be lies. There is a definite conflict between their stories of today with no supporting documents and their stories of 1970's which are supported by the Department of Defense.The major question is whether they were lying in the 1970's when they submitted their reports, or were they lying in the 1990's when a few of them came out and praised John Kerry or are they lying now.Since all the government documents support Kerry and the Swift Boat Veterans 1970's reports, it can be reasoned that Kerry and the 1970 Swift Boat Veterans were telling the truth while the 2004 Swift Boats veterans fail to meet even the lowest criteria for accuracy."
5,I hear its an awesome book,"I have not read it but I hear its a counters the lies that ""Scary"" Kerry is pushing about his Vietnam record.Look at this way: Kerry has supported the other side in every major conflict the US has engaged in, from Vietnam, Cuba to Iraq.Who is Kerry working for???"
5,Oh yes...Vietnam...again.,"Not only did John O'Niel proove that John Kerry was no leader, that his two tours of duty only lasted under four months, that John Kerry betrayed his fellow vets and his country but that John Kerry did it all for himself. He had an agenda all along. His goal was to become President of the USA and thanks to the biased media, he nearly succeeded. Thank God for John O'Niel and the Swift Boat Vets for exposing this Bendict Arnold before it was too late.I can't wait untill Unfit For Command comes out in paperback and in closing, John Kerry, when will you sign form 180? What are you trying to hide? The election is over and Kerry has a snowballs chance in hell of even winning the democrat nominee position in 2008 (Hillary will be running and will blow Kerry away easily) so why not sign form 180 John as you promised you would after Pres. Bush did?"
1,You've Got to be Kidding!,"I don't understand how anyone can take such a pack of lies as this book contains seriously. Filled with envy and hate, the authors would seem to be totally incapable of dealing with reality.The people they interviewed might have served in Vietnam at the same time as John Kerry, but they did not serve with him. In short, their testimony totally lacks credibility.Rather than buying this book, anyone interested in the current election debate should read William B. Rood's article published in the August 22, 2004, edition of the Chicago Tribune.Mr. Rood did serve with Mr. Kerry."
1,Complete nonsense,"This book come from supporters of a president who never served in Vietnam, used his powerful family to get a National Guard job in Texas, and then disappeared from his Guard assignment after transfering to Alabama. That is all you need to know about this one...I dare Amazon to print this review."
1,I have a video of John O'Neill doing a monkey dance...only $50 bucks !,"What, prove it? What are you, some kind of broke internet junkie ?! You just can't handle the truth, dude !It's enough that I say it !!Sort of like John O'Neill and the Swift Boat liars. And their own little dancing monkey, the five star reviewer."
1,lies and the lying liars who boat in them,"This book is a blatant attempt to discredit the U.S. military. John Kerry did not nominate himself for the medals, they were given by the military in recognition of his conduct."
1,"Pathetic, in addition to being badly written","This book is drivel, and I seriously doubt many of the ""reviews"" here are by people who've actually read this glorified door-stop. Mr. O'Neill, the remainder bins are calling! Try instead Paul O'Neill's book 'The Price OfLoyalty."" BTW, Bush is finished. Not gonna happen, folks!Read something worthwhile and save your money."
5,"Sad, but true!","Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!It seems, that once, just ""this once"" that amazon decides to ""change policy"" I have decided to change my policy! Order elsewhere! There is no need for me to support a company that has an ""agenda"". Bad, very bad business decision."
1,Total Lies and Fabrication,"This book, like the 'Swiftboat Vets for Lies' is nothing BUT lies. Every single one of the statements written by O'Neill have been proven false, but this smear campaign is allowed to continue. If you want to waste your money and give it to a bunch of rich guys who enjoy smearing others and keep repeating lies, this is the book for you."
1,infomercial for W.,"These ""Veterans for Truth"" send a message that is farthest from the truth. One says ""John Kerry lied about what happened in Vietnam, I know because I was there"". Then after careful research did I find out that ""there"" meant in Vietnam, he'd never actually witnessed any of Kerry's actions. The accusations are so vague - where is the proof that Kerry is ""Unfit for command""?"
2,Politically Motivated Shennanigans!,"An inciteful not an insightful book. Fit for those that watch Fahrenheit 9-11. Devotes little time to fact, highly discredited and worth little less than the paper it was printed on. A great waste of money and useless diversion from the politics of the moment. Everything is fair in war and love , but in an attempt to present gibberish in the wool of intellectual analysis is not only disgraceful but once again re-emphasizes the politics of hate and destruction that have overtaken our nation, about a decade after the 1992 election was won and lost. God Bless George Kerry and no one else - that is the succint review."
5,Finally...the FACTS!,"This is a very great interesting book...showing in depth detail on the indecisive...flip flop person we know as Kerry. Kerry lied about his so called ""honorable"" and clean Vietnam service. Rather...he committed atrocities...AND ADMITTED TO IT! Do we need a raper, murderer...flip flopper as our president? Nope.Kerry's debate speech was so effective...I'm gonna vote for him, BEFORE I VOTE AGAINST HIM."
1,THE BOTTOM LINE,"John Kerry volunteered twice to fight in the Vietnam war. His views changed after losing friends in battle and seeing the chaos of war.George W. Bush received multiple deferrments and eventually a position in the ""Champagne Squad,"" the Texas Air National Gaurd. There he spent his time partying and flying high.All the BS in this book, even if it is 1/10th true, doesn't obscure the fact that one candidate walked towards the enemy, while the other candidate turned away. If war is any test of a man, only one man running this year even showed up."
2,I found this book so compelling,"I found this book so compelling that after reading it, I donated $500 to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. On a side note, I was in Vietnam as a navy Lt. JG at the same time John Kerry was testifying before the congress against his former friends. I neither saw nor heard of any atrocities during my time in Westpac.I am sadly disappointed with Amazon's policy regarding this book. Acordingly, I will no longer purchase any additional books from Amazon."
1,Forget this book!!,"This book is just a bunch of hype perpetrated by a bunch of whackos and liars who want to keep Bush in office. And as for the bamboo chest, I went to the author's book site and read the back cover. It plainly has a quote from the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington DC stating that it is a pack of lies. Ignore tangocharlie's review. Total bull! Kerry is a real hero and deserves to be president!!!!"
1,Unfit for Command,"Please, people, do some research. By now all of you (except the peabrains still watching Fox News or listening to that bloated scrod Limbaugh) KNOW that John O'Neill is a whiny nebbish with a personal grudge. You should also know by now, unless you're comatose - that only one of the Swiftboat Perjurers even knew Kerry - minimally - AND that the so-called 'doctor' who claims to have treated Kerry's 'self-inflicted' wounds, wasn't the doctor of record - in fact, he wasn't even mentioned in the medical records. He's was L-Y-I-N-G as they all were. What a waste of trees. Listen to Air America Radio and get a clue. www.airamericaradio.com"
5,Almost surreal,I had to remind myself of the reality I am living in when I read the reviews here describing Kerry with adjectives that fit George W. Bush to a T.- Ajoy Bhatia
4,Unfit for Command,I know in our world there are two stories to all conditions in life but if half of this book is true then John Kerry should not be in public office. What a disgrace to all service members who served our great country. He should placed on the same list as Jane Fonda.
1,UNBELIEVABLE,"THE AUTHOR,JOHN ONEILL,AND THE SWIFT BOAT VETERANS COMING UP WITH THESE ""FACTS"" ABOUT KERRY'S MILITARY EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE POLYGRAPHED. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A ""CHIP ON SHOULDER"" MENTALITY PRESENT IN THIS WORK OF VENDETTA. I GUESS KERRY'S COMMENTS ON ATTROCITIES IN VIETNAM HAVE PROVEN TO BE FALSE AS WELL. WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MEAN SOME OF OUR TROOPS DID RAZE AND RAVAGE IN REVENGE FOR SEEING THEIR FRIENDS BLOWN APART? KERRY HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THAT! WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE, HE DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT? WHERE THE HELL ARE WE? AMERICA? OH YEAH,WE ARE AND HE DOES! IT'S EVIDENT MOST VIETNAM VETS DID THE ABSOLUTE BEST THEY COULD IN SUCH A QUAGMIRE. BUT BECAUSE KERRY SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE EXAMPLES OF INHUMANITY SOME OF OUR FORCES WERE CAPABLE OF, THIS GROUP OF GUYS, MOST OF WHOM NEVER SAW KERRY IN VIETNAM, DECIDE TO EXACT A LITTLE ""PAYBACK"" ON ""THE TRAITOR"", KERRY. ROVE'S THIS GROUPS BEHIND THE SCENES DIRECTOR. AND IT IS TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!"
1,"The Ultimate in ""Flip-Flopping""","Many of the so-called swift boat veterns for truth are neither swift nor truthful. This book is a prime example. Even Senator John McCain has spoken out against the ads and against the group. Bush, as usual, will not openly condemn the ads and this author but he comes out against all independant ads, mainly because the majority are against him. This author along with the rest of these veterans for truth have political reasons for doing what they are doing now and I have no doubt that they are being well paid for this attack, not only through book sales but by the Bush administration as well. I have seen one particular member of this propaganda machine say great things about Kerry 8 years earlier and then reverse his postion on the commercial. Just another set of lies by this administration who are closely relative to the swift boat veterens for truth. This book is a prime example of attack politics disguised as a truthful book. They are truly shameless."
5,Outstanding Book! Couldn't put it down!,"I book this book this afternoon and read it nonstop from 4pm untill now. What an easy read! Contrary to the 1 star reviews, this is a well written book. And it is a best seller...again. Thanks to people like me who tell you the truth.Great book. Highly recommended. Get it while you can."
5,"""just the facts 'Maam""","I read the book. There are copious references to back up the claims. JFK never volunteered to go to Vietnam, be joined the naval reserves to aviod it. He chose the swift boat assignment to avoid combat. He sought his purple hearts to get out of harms way. The most disturbing aspect of this book was is collusion with the enemy in Paris while still enlisted. It is sad but the liberal left doesn't have the backbone to defend this country and are the first to blame America for everything. Read the book."
1,LIES and the LYING LIARS That tell them!,"ORWELLION!!!Amazon.com is rife with SHEEP! It is a scary thing to see all those brainwashed neocon FOX followers all in one place.I highly doubt any of those sheep read, they are posting empty threats. Hell I doubt any of them hold stock in the company either."
1,"United, ha!","Having read the screeds of the swifty supporters, having viewed the RNC, having read the daily campaign coverage, I have concluded that ""United We Stand"" is inoperable and impossible. This is a deeply divided country heading for even deeper divisions. Majority may rule, but if a slim, slim majority votes for fascism this November, is democracy thus served?"
5,Excellent book,"I initally approached this book as a political attack on Kerry. I found the book to be very well written, and filled with factual accounts of Kerry's time before, during, and after Vietnam. I find it very hard to believe that all these people would have the same story, while Kerry changes his more often than his socks. This book, I believe acurately portrays Kerry as a political opportunist who went to Vietnam for political gain, recommended himself for medals for political gain, then ""returned"" them for political gain, and formated his accounts as needed for political gain. This pattern is the same as he uses today in pursuit of elected office. Highly recommend this book to anyone who bases election decisons on facts, not on emotional appeal."
1,Believe what you want to believe - nothing will change,"Reviewers here are complete neo-con ""wealth serving"" ditto-heads.Just keep repeating the mantra boys -even you will believe it after awhile.O'Neil has no credibility. None. I wouldn't believehim no matter what he told me. If you think he iscreditable you have a perfect ability to suspendlogic when it's convenient for your argument.Like when you're told ...The economy is great. NOT.The war was necessary. WRONG.Only I will defend you. PLEEEASE !We'll protect the environment. HA!HA!HA!You don't need over-time pay. REALLY.Kerry is bad. Repeat after me ""Kerry is bad!""""Kerry is bad!""Distort. Distort. For if you knew the real truthyou would NEVER vote for the 'W' and you wouldhonor men who deserve our respect.But you won't. You'll vote for someone that hasnone of ""yours"" or ""your families"" interests again and again.Go figure!"
1,Support the troops?,"I've been listening to John O'Neill on right-wing radio for several days. It's strange to hear conservatives criticize Kerry for doing the same sorts of things thousands of soldiers have done - embellish their military logs, collect medals of dubious value, and work to get out of the combat zone as soon as possible. The slant that John O'Neill gives to the discussion strikes me as something beyond an attack on Kerry, it's also an effort to pressure soldiers in Iraq to stay the course of another immoral invasion of a defenseless nation. Kerry's crucifixion is a lesson to all in the armed services who have doubts about partaking in the American empire's violence.People who want to hear critiques of ""Unfit to Command,"" and want a more balanced picture of who John Kerry is, can tune into http://www.AirAmericaRadio.com. Or, they can choose to let themselves be deceived."
1,"""Unfit for Print""","Poorly-researched, with most of the major contentions already proven to be factually inaccurate, and not particularly well-written, this is nevertheless the book for you if you are genetically disposed to hating John Kerry, regardless of facts.A word of advice, though: save your money right now; when the current ""celebrity"" status dies away in a few days, you'll be able to buy this one for for under $1.00."
1,Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Joh,It doesn't even rate 1 star. So many holes in the in this book.
2,Why These Men Are Out To Slander John Kerry,"After Viet Nam, John Kerry, who did his patriotic duty duringthe war, also felt as an honorable American, he should speakhis mind, along with other former Vets who witnessed atrocitiescommitted, by a small minority of American soldiers, in a warthat the US never should have got involved in: the majority of USsoldiers served both admirably and heroiclly in Viet Nam; JohnO'Neill was angered when Kerry spoke out: O'Neill is aright wing Republican, he has gotten this group togetherby spreading untrue rumours about John Kerrys' service, O'Neillsgroup is being backed by a rich Texas contributor to the Bushcampaign,this book is being used as propaganda for Bushs'campaign."
1,You all make me want to be an Independant,Enough about Vietnam as those who died are dead and those who lived are still making everyone else wish they died by writing absolute rubbish about swift boats and the draft ect. The war was wrong then and is wrong now and only the innocents are being killed and that includes US soldiers. All you reviewers with your mean and disgusting comments should be ashamed as the only reason in reality you make comments about this is caus you want attention for yourselves caus you are all very lonely and thats the real shame.
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"With all the recent revelations about the lack of truthfulness of those who wrote this worthless list of words, shouldn't it be in the fiction section now?"
1,Do not agree,"I think this book is only propaganda made against John Kerry.So they tell John Kerry was such a bad guy in Vietnam ?Remember Georges Bush didn't even go to Vietnam.Remember Georges Bush was the initiator of a new Vietnam war in Irak, without any evidence of links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaida, and without any evidence of the so called weapons of mass destruction.Remember Ben Laden and Mollah Omar are still free, while our army is occupying a country which had nothing to do with 9/11 events ..."
1,Lying. AWOL. Coward.,One of them volunteered to serve in Vietnam. The other did not.One of them saw combat. The other did not.One of them fulfilled all his service commitments. The other went AWOL. And lied about it. Where's his character or integrity?Kerry is the only real man of the two.Your guy is the lying AWOL coward.Your guy is the lying AWOL coward.Your guy is the lying AWOL coward.
1,What a waste of time...,Complete drivel from a bunch of bitter men who couldn't handle Kerry's guts in speaking out against Vietnam... The book is complete heresay and a lot of it is obviously partisan politics. I can't believe we have one candidate who volunteered for two tours of combat duty and one candidate who hid in Texas...and the brave one actually has to put up with trash books like this. ridiculous...
1,Absolute crap,"Some veterans may not like Kerry's testimony before Congress, but smearing a soldier's performance because you don't like his politics is dishonorable."
5,Over 300 Swiftboat Vets speak out against Kerry.,"This communist aly should have been charged with treason over 34 years ago. Some countries would have executed someone for doing this. What does Kerry get? He becomes a senator and lives of taxpayers money to the tune of $150,000, runs for president and runs his mouth with utter nonsense.These vietnam veterans are revealing what they saw personally. It is fact, not opinion. If you are looking for truth, read Unfit For Command."
3,History vs. Hysteria,"Possibly historians will sort out the truth of John Kerry's service in Vietnam. This book is well written and provides another perspective than the one presented by the presidential candidate. People of priveledge in America have long received special consideration in serving in the military. Did John Kerry? We may never know the whole story. This is one account. It may have been slanted by bitterness over John Kerry's 1971 tesimony but it is an important resource.As a historian, Amazon.com has dissapointed me in allowing political attacks in the review process. But it is interesting to see how many people can not see past their ideology when reviewing a book, both on the left and right."
1,Politically motivated rubbish,"Who cares that none of the authors actually served with Kerry? Who cares that the people who actually served with him deny these accusations? Who cares that the writing is terrible? If you don't care, then this might be the book for you.Otherwise, it is a complete waste of time to read."
5,UFC: A riveting acount of a left wing liar,"Unfit For Command offers a riveting account on how one self-proclaimed hero created a heroic image of himself, abused navy policies, actually conspired with the enemy, went on a murdering spree and then made false allegations against the real heroes who represented their country all for the dream of someday becoming President of the United States! The facts in this well documented book will make your blood boil!Thank God he failed."
1,"From the same people that brought you ""Freedom Fries""","Wow, I guess right wingers have never really been known for their ingenious creativity. Is it not blatantly obvious that this book is just a distraction from Bush's war record ? Nothing more and nothing less. Only two more months to go and counting. Bye Bye Bush and yes, I am from Texas."
1,Bush O'neill Factor,"We are at a time in history when it is important to research what we are doing. I am someone who has spent most of my life working as a nurse overseas. Never have I seen my country so hated. People all over make this very personal? Why because the President has promoted, encouraged and made possible such a book as this. It is So scary. It breaks my heart. The book has merit as it can show you how well these people can twist things. This book could not have been written by Bush. He couldn't have pulled it off so he got his buddy from the Nixon days and now we have it. Terrifying. It is number one because many such as me have read it. This country is heading in the wrong direction. This book proves that anyone can lie and even get an ISBN number for it! LIES all of it."
1,American Prophesy by Michael Evans,"I dont have much time for reading, therefore, I prefer to read books with substance............The ""he said this and I said this"" kind of material is a waste of my time."
1,O'Neill Was Paid Off Years AGO!,"A piece of garbage. I expected more ""genuine"" facts. Check O'Neill's record. He was paid off by the Nixon administration years ago to discredit Kerry back then. I guess his hate goes deep! Nixon told O'Neill back then to do whatever it takes to paint Kerry as a long haired hippy, anti-war, etc. Blah, Blah, Blah. I guess O'Neill never got over it. Anyway, there are alot better ""reads"" out there regarding Kerry and Bush than this piece of ""animosity"". Also one of the writers (not O'Neill) used to be on the board of one of the most extreme religiousright organizations in America. His extreme beliefs about religion and race would really horrify many who have already read this book. However, that has not been mentioned in mainstream press. Follow the trail. This is envy, hate, and a ""smear campaign"". Buy the book, but thoroughly investigate ""all"" the men who have written this book before you make up your mind about their so called facts and agenda."
5,Awesome book with indisputable facts,Read this book and understand why Kerry is so much wanting to pin this on George Bush as a smear campaign. No smears in this book...just facts - sorry Kerry...guess you should have thought before you opened your mouth back in the Congressional Hearings and when you opened it again at the Dem convention.Read this book and then make your own mind up as to who is lying about their service - I am sure it will become abundantly clear.
1,e-gad... how low will they go?,"My god.... even if these lies were somehow related to the truth, am i supposed to turn to george w. bush, and HIS war record... is there any level to which these people will not sink?"
1,Opportunistic INSTA-book,This book is poorly written and grasps for straws in making a case against Senator Kerry.
1,Get real.,Anyone who believes the lies in this book is naive and foolish. It is clearly the work of jealous men with personal grudges.
1,Fringe veterans who never served with Kerry,"This book employs a few accounts from people who, during Vietnam, were willing to sign off on Kerry's competancy and heroism and now are reversing their stories with a little funding help from the Bush campaign. One of the men Harlowe, has already been proven to be lying since the navy officially documented him nowhere near John Kerry at the time he claimed he was. Virtually all of the rest of the people in this book are veterans who never served near John Kerry at all and are merely angry about his post-war testimony to the Senate. This book is full of vicious lies and I imagine that after the pending libel lawsuit Senator Kerry has against the authors it will be put in it's place once and for all."
1,"If you believe this book, I have a bridge to sell you.","People, I had to read this book to see what all the hype was about. After reading the book, I started looking into the facts on my own. An interesting article in the Washington Post titled ""Swift Boat Accounts Incomplete"" should be read before you buy this book. There are numerous other articles I could suggest but in a nutshell, though I wanted this book to be true, it appears to be mostly a political tool, so don't waste your money. And though I may not like the policies John Kerry supports, I have come to the same conclusion as John McCain, Kerry is a war hero."
1,Swift Boat Veterans Lie,"I am not Democrat and voted for both George W and his father.But I do listen to the news, and the US Navy reports, and read the documents presented and listen to the actual witnesses views of each of his metals as well as read this book. What a total waste of money and time this book is!There is not one witness in the whole group and all the opinions are either conjecture or story telling. I wonder how much money the Bush doners paid them to come up with this trash. My advice save your money,"
3,Ah yes...Viet Nam,"This book points out not only John Kerry's ""leadership"" in Viet Nam but once again highlights the wonderful morals of all Viet Nam vets. O'Neill is doing a wonderful job in raising all those old feelings again. But what the heck, Pal, you got your monument in Washington."
1,Big Question,If the authors are after the truth why didn't they interview anyone who actually served on Kerry's boat? This is highly suspicious.
1,Swifties are neither swift nor tell the truth,"The Swifty scum were paid by ""HotKarl"" Rove to lie. They should all burn in hell. At least Kerry served, and didn't snort coke and get 2 DWI's, then marry a woman who killed her previous boyfriend."
1,Swift Boat Veterans Funded by Bush.,"This book is the republicans revenge for Fahrenheit 9/11. None of the soldiers in this book actually served with Kerry. This book is a good example of what happens when Bush and his crew get nervous and scared. It's part of the 95 million dollars Bush is spending to defeat Kerry. If you are looking for truth, save your money....."
4,Difficult to Dismiss,"With all the political heat surrounding the Swift Boat Vets for Truth, I had to read this title. I must say it is well-written and provocative. I'm disappointed with the attempts to dismiss the swift boat vets in general and this title in particular as being a smear tactic of the Republicans. While it is an election year and mud-slinging is certainly present, the questions raised by this book merit further investigation. Rather than crying foul over repeated questions over his war record, why doesn't Kerry just file a standard form 180 and set matters straight? His unwillingness to provide full disclosure gives this title much more credibility."
1,weekly world news woulda done it better,"The stories these swift boat fellers came up with, why that's nuthin' compared to what I've heard.According to one of my sources, John Kerry routinely bites the heads offa bunny rabbits.Worse than that, a reliable insider tells me Kerry once cooked up some babies and served them to a group of right-wing lobbyists in a pie. It's all true.And get this: a guy I know says that Lt. Kerry was so desperate to get a medal in the 'Nam that he blowed his own head off with a bazooka. If you look carefully at the cover of this book, I think you'll see clearly, that's a fake head."
1,Bush paid for these lies - don't buy them.,"The authors of this book are venal liars, opportunists and a disgrace to the uniform they once wore. Their beef is with Kerry's anti-war testimony after his service was over, not his command itself. In furtherane of that grudge, they debase themselves with filthy lies bought and paid for by Bush operatives. Elliott has already stated he shouldn't have signed the affidavit in support of his version of the facts. He's a perjurer by his own admission! Bush's campaign attorney advised these guys. This is Bush's doings, like those vile smears he brought about in a whisper campaign against John McCain in 2000.John Kerry will survive this mudslinging by Bush. Bush shows his desperation and debased morality with every lie he procures. America can do better."
1,No Proof - Just MORE Lies from the BUSHWORLD SWIFTRATS,"More of the same old lies from George W Bush and his collection of two or more time losers such as Cheny and Rumsfeld. If George will tell us how he ducked the draft and got a plum Air National Guard assignment when he made the lowest possible score on the test to determine eligibility for the Air National Guard (too dumb to fly!!) but then leapt to the top of the acceptance list (with the help of Daddy) then I might think that he and his Texas mafia are more than the liars they are. By the way was it just a councidence that the former commander of the Texas Air National Guard was picked by George W to be Commander of the entire US Air National Guard system after he cleaned up George W's Air National Guard file and disposed of any embarassing details such as missed drug tests and ""no shows"" for drills?? I think not!"
1,"One Star, Because There's No Zero Option","This book is absolute nonsense. Not a SINGLE one of the men involved with this book or ""Swift Boat Veterans for Bush"" (let's call a spade a spade, shall we? These men aren't ""for truth."" They're ""for Bush."" Which usually implies antithesis) EVER SERVED WITH JOHN KERRY.Despite their incomprehensible implication that being in Vietnam AT THE SAME TIME means they ""served with John Kerry,"" the fact is, not one of these men were on Kerry's boat.And their specious, outrageous, partisan and outright evil smear campaign against the man who will be our next President is atrocious, beneath contempt and, frankly, grounds for going to hell, as far as I'm concerned."
1,The power of media,"It's scary how many reviewers still believe this book is true. It is October already. The book has been thoroughly discredited by reputable sources, yet the positive reviews continue to pour in. I see conservative talk-show rhetoric repeated in the reviews, mantras that are crafted and pasted onto the public by the wizards of spin and fear and hate.Karl Rove found the magic pill when he discovered the potency of the 'Attack their Strength' strategy. Are we just too shallow and unsophisticated to deal with books like this? Are we, as Michael Moore once said, the stupidest people on earth? I wonder."
1,Total crap,"Republicans try to pass this off as the bible, but no one served with him who wrote this book. Nevermind all documents back up Kerry's story. Nevermind this ""Swift Boat Charade for Bush"" group has been backed by people in Bush's administration. Well it's too bad this b.s. of a book has become so popular due to the media. How about we write a book about Bush's service in the Natl. Gaurd....oh wait...he went AWOL..."
1,"Pure, stinking garbage","If you believe anything Ann Coulter has written, then this tripe is just right for you.If you prefer reality, then you'll wonder, like so many of us, why Amazon is even selling this book."
1,LIBEL.,"This book is the embodiment of the word libel.If you insist on reading it, know that it is a work of fiction,that it is election year propaganda funded by the Bush campaign and that it was fabricated by someone with a grudge."
3,like watching an avalanche from the next mountain over...,"Short version: Thanks to Amazon for treating us as adults. You don't have to agree with what the 5 stars and the one stars say. It's better to have the full range of information to work from than to trust someone else as your editor. SERIOUS QUESTION: why don't Amazon remove the restrictions on ALL reviews and put the same caveat on the reviews as in this case. That way, we can get a full debate and Amazon acts as a facilitator. By the way, as far as I can tell, Amazon isn't on anybody's side. Would the nay-sayers really have an insipid, edited debate or the full fat version? After all, one of the best (if most problematic) parts of free speech is the right to think that the person you are listening to is talking excrement, right?"
5,"Thank you, Swift Boat Veterans","This book is a MUST READ. Whether you call yourself liberal, or conservative, I don't care. If you think of yourself as one who demands integrity in public servants at all levels of service, then you owe it to yourself to understand the kind of man That John Kerry really is, how frighteningly close he came to winning that election and how vigilant we voter's MUST be. The forthright accounts in this book- from numerous individuals expose John Kerry as entirely despicable and self serving.Four of my brothers served in the US NAVY in Vietnam. Each are genuine heros of impeccable integrity. I thought of them while I read this book, and the fury I felt towards Kerry was indescribable. He has NO right to ever refer to them as 'brother's in arms'.This kind of person is definitely NOT the sort we want or need anywhere near our White House!"
1,Where was Dubya?,How could Kerry have know that his service to this country would have be more appreciated had he had his daddy arrange for him to dodge the draft and get a cushy do-nothing job with the National Guard so that he could then miss a medical exam and go AWOL because he was snorting coke with his buddies?
5,"Oh this is funny, 1 star reviewer still doesn't know how to google.","What happened there KAB, LOST REVIEWER, Loyd (sic), American Patriot etc., didn't anybody show you how to use google or won't your parents loan you the $50 to get the video? Or perhaps you spilled koolaid all over your pc?You total posts to date: 50. Not counting those that we had Amazon delete.Keep posting. You are giving us all a good laugh. Haaaaaaaaaaa!"
1,PURELY FICTION...,"This book has already been proven to be false, filled with lies from disgruntled vets who don't like what Kerry did in the past. Do your own research and don't believe everything you read. THINK people!!!! Why would someone self inflict injury THEN request to go back into combat!?!?!?!?!? one of the people involved in this book has already come forward and admitted to lieing... its just a matter of time until some of the others develope a concious and do the same. Why don't you actually pay attention to real issues and quick getting distracted by this junk."
1,Give me a break!,"I bought and read this book in order to see if it was accurate or objective, at all. It is not. Is anybody else sick and tired of being ""managed"" by the power elite if this nation? This book is just one more prime example of how we are all being lied to and manipulated. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of John Kerry. I think both the Republican and Democrat agendas are two sides of the same coin. They both lie and manipulate to gain/maintain power and control. Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out is just another fairy tale told by partisan liers. Wake up america. We are quickly losing our freedoms and our country... the freedom and country that our ancestors fought and died for. Listen to National Public Radio. It's the only major source of news that is not big corporation (government) controlled. Especially listen to Democracy Now on NPR. Give it a try."
5,200 men wrong ???,"Loved the book, but then again I am Bush supporter, however, I enjoy reading the liberal's view of this book... I find it amusing that they embraced Michael's Moore's lies in Farenheit 9/11 but blast 200 men's version of what REALLY happened on John Kerry's ""stint"" in Viet Nam. Give me a break!"
1,As Obvious as any BushCo. Campaign Tactic,"Funny thing that half the folks who are speaking out against Kerry in this disppointing production praised him less than a year ago. Things that make ya' go Hmmmm.Anyone interested in ""buying into"" this attack should also read the New York Times article ""Friendly Fire: The Birth of an Anti-Kerry Ad"" By Kate Zernike & Jim Rutenberg (August 20, 2004). Give them both a try and then you decide for yourself.VOTE!"
1,Truly incredible.,"I just don't understand the whole premise. How does VOLUNTEERING for military service, then VOLUNTEERING for dangerous combat duty, then being heroic in battle but not quite heroic enough (according to these ""witnesses"" who weren't actually there), make one UNFIT to be President?Not to name names (even though personal attacks are now allowed by Amazon), shouldn't this ""unfit"" candidate be at least marginally more qualified for the job than a hypothetical opponent who avoided active duty in a war he supported and then went AWOL from his National Guard service in order to avoid drug tests? Luckily for the hypothetical candidate, there don't seem to be ANY witnesses to his military service who might impugn his ""courage"" or those of his pro-war friends who had ""other priorities"" in the 1960's.The authors and publishers and flacks for this book should be ashamed of the role they are trying to play in the current election."
1,Bush has absolutely no genitals at all,"It is a sad commentary on America when the Repug candidate/Resident was an AWOL coward who avoided Vietnam, and refused to volunteer for combat. He then lied about going AWOL in his autobiography, even though military records prove he did so, and then has the dishonor to question a REAL veteran's service. He should be kicked into the gutter like the worthless dog he is.These facts will never change:Your guy is an AWOL lying coward.Your guy is an AWOL lying coward.Your guy is an AWOL lying coward."
1,UNFIT FOR PUBLICATION,"Since publication, the writers and members of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (Orwellian doublespeak) have been discredited by several sources and so have shown themselves to be liars. They also have direct connections to the Bush Administration, so there are no unbiased opinions in this hateful book.They try to smear an authentic American war hero, and in the process smear innocent veterans who vouch for Kerry's record in Viet Nam and smear the NAVY as well. They are not patriots, they are neocon fascists trying to sway votes to Bush, who still has not been able to produce one witness to show he served his time at the Alabama military base. Bush missed his medical exam and training without repercussion of a court martial. But he could still possibly be found guilty of desertion.This book is nothing but a piece of Bush propaganda. Amazon should drop it from their website, or at least label it as fiction or fantasy. Too bad there is no Trash catagory!"
1,100% Political Farse,This book is a shining example of the tricks the neo right wing groups try to pull to discredit a former Vietnam war hero while silencing criticism of Bush's 1970's coke binge after which deserting his service. The difference between this and Fahrenheit 911 is that Moore's film is based on actual undisputed fact while this is just blatant lies paid for by the Bush nuts to try and push thier own greedy unAmerican policies. The true knuckleheads are coming out of the woodwork praising this garbage and it's those same yokels that are gonna drag the rest of us intelligent folks down with them...these people should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Bush-financed smear campaign,"The story you'll find here is not credible, and has been thoroughly refuted by the major media, including (but limited to) the New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian.But whatever the details of his record, Kerry volunteered for service in the war and repeatedly risked his life.Meanwhile the Bush family used its connections to secure Bush a coveted Texas-based job in the Air National Guard.Questions remain over whether Bush completed that service. Vice-President Dick Cheney meanwhile got repeated deferments from the Vietnam draft and is on record as saying he had 'other priorities' than military service."
1,So Called Short Tour,"ALL servicemen wounded for the third time in Vietnam were rotated home after their third Purple Heart. The record short tour was for a Marine flown into Khe Sanh, wounded, and wounded twice more while waiting for medevac. His tour of duty was about four days.If this is as accurate as the authors can get, this book should be immediately dumpstered."
1,Not worth the time.,"These guys have been refuted by the the only other Officer still alive who was there the day Kerry won his Bronze Star. See the Chicago Tribune article written on 8-21-04 by William B. Rood, who was the other Officer and is now a writer for the Chicago Tribune. These guys have had a vendetta against Kerry for years. Bush has no right to challenge anyone's actions during Vietnam. I guess it would be better had Kerry stayed in the states and gotten drunk instead of going to Vietnam in the first place?"
1,blah blah blah,"If you REALLY want a good read correcting the record on the half-truths and lies surrounding certain folks' military records, check out ""Unfit Commander, Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush"" by Glenn W. Smith, also available through Amazon. It's the real (to date) story of George W. Bush's military records. Meanwhile, I'm thinking about forming a group called ""Bass boat Veterans for Truth."" Our goal will be to have a few beers while chuckling about those who try to re-write the history of true American combat heros for the sake of an election. Have fun and cheer up...the election will be over soon."
5,The truth that needed to be told,"This book point out simply what the title says John Kerry is ""unfit for command"".I am in the military and I am proud to serve my country and very proud to be a member of the United States miitary. This book is a must read for anyone actually thinking about voting for John Kerry. I wasnt sure who I was going to vote for but after reading this book I have totally made up my mind. John Kerry is unfit to even serve in the Senate let alone be the leader of the free world."
1,Vietnam?,"Shouldn't we be talking more about the war in Iraq instead of talking about a war that happened 30 years ago? Something has to be wrong here.John Kerry served in Vietnam. Bush did not... and that's it!And why did Bush say that the war in Iraq cannot be won? Has he gone mad? Of course it can be won! I bet that if Bush would have stayed in Afghanistan and captured Bin Laden, that would have broken the confindense of these terrorists.Again John Kerry can only do better than George W. Bush as I don't think any president can stoop that low. John F. Kerry is a confident man, and that is what we need in America... especially in these times of crisis."
1,Karl Rove is a Genius!,"Karl Rove is a genius. He has all of you reading a book about Vietnam instead of reading the reports of what is happening in Iraq today, or what about the lost jobs to other countries, the increasing poverty level, the increasing number of unemployed and uninsured and the growing disgust the world has for America. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Look behind the George W. Bush curtain and you will find the mighty wizard Karl Rove controlling your every thought."
1,The Mission Of George W. Bush,"We have lost 4,000 lives in the twin tower attacks on 9/11. Since then we have added 1,500 American lives killed in combat. We have succeeded in killing thousands of Iraqis.My mission as president is to increase these numbers.I would like to increase the casualty rate and decrease the job rate in America.My plan for middle class America is to send them all to Iraq.America has turned the corner. We are getting things done.I am George W. Bush and I approve of this message."
1,Full of inaccurate and partisan stories,"If you do any research on your own, you will find this book to be full of unsubstantiated statements by people with something to gain by lying.Everyone who served on John Kerry's swift boat has testified to John Kerry's heroism and are supporting him in his compaign for President. None of the writers of this book, nor the people interviewed in the book, served on the swift boat with John Kerry.If you are going to read this book, make sure to read up on what G.W. Bush was doing during the Vietnam War. Read as much as you can about both candidates from a diverse range of writers, and make your own decisions on the candidates."
1,Simply Stupid & Slanderous,"""They're a bunch of political hacks who only care about smearing John Kerry and propping up George W. Bush,"" said a source close to the Bush campaign who is insufferably pleased with how gullible and stupid the Swift Boat group has turned out to be, and only spoke on condition that his name not be used. ""Boy, are they fools. We are slashing veterans benefits left and right in the next budget once the President gets re-elected. And these suckers are doing our dirty work for free!""The Kerry campaign refused to comment, citing more important issues like the continuing problematic occupation in Iraq, spiraling health care costs, insufficient job creation, and a ballooning federal budget deficit, that are occupying the candidate and the campaign's time."""
5,I just bought my copy today -thank you revewer from Ohio,"Like so many others, I was having a had time getting this book thanks to the efforts of the John Kerry people. After reading the review from DD from OHIO, I found UNFIT FOR COMMAND at my local Wal Mart too.There is no longer any doubt i my mind that KERRY is a lying scoundral.And....why won't Kerry sign form 180 if he has nothing to hide? And why is Kerry tryg so hard to block this book if he is innocent?"
1,Poor,This is a terrible misrepresentation of John Kery's political views and experiences. George Bush is the one who should be under investigation for his military record; not an actual Vietnam War veteran.
1,Full of distortions,"One thing that is great about the US is that you can write anything, call it a book and someone will publish it. This one definitely belongs in the fiction column though. From the moment it was published, people have been coming forward to refute what it says. One of the admirals who is quoted questioning Kerry has been caught in the fact that he signed the papers for Kerry's commendations and wrote letters extolling him as a fine officer. The Swift Boat veterans who are included did NOT serve with Kerry, so how do they know what happened on his boat? Evidence has been discovered that this group is connected to the Bush campaign, so the book is nothing but propaganda. There's nothing wrong with that as long as the reader knows what he is getting. If you read this or see Fahrenheit 9-11 and KNOW that both are distortions to benefit certain political philosophies, then you should be OK."
1,A distraction from genuine Presidential campaign issues,"This book is partisan and its account is dubious. As ""Nightline"" showed on October 14, the evidence for its claims is weak. The timing and content of the book appear to be consistent with an attempt to confuse potential voters in the upcoming Presidential election. I think we'd all be better off simply picking our President based on the issues brought up in the campaign where the candidates have made their positions clear, as opposed to on this sort of suspect material which intends to imply that one of the candidates is not capable of leading our nation."
1,Blather.,"Absolute blather. Why did I read it? Even after hearing that none of the people involved with putting this bilge together actually served on the boat with Kerry, I read it anyway...a glutton for BS I suppose. The people that actually DID serve with Kerry stood behind him at the Democratic National Convention. The U.S. Military did award Kerry his medals and now, many years later, this group of dubious distinction, trys to rewrite history and tell another version. Liars all. I hope Kerry goes after each of them for perjury."
1,These guys will stop at nothing,"to poison minds and throw the Democratic process, including any manner of lies, libel and other feverish garbage. These are the same guys that tried to make McCain look like a traitor for being a P.O.W. so they could push Bush down our throats. Shame! and shame on Amazon.com for supporting such sinister, underhanded crap. May the authors get exactly what they deserve (jail time after a wallet crushing bunch of legal hassles) for misusing the media. Unless you are fans of the lunatic fringe don't waste your time or your money paying good money for this load of drivel. No stars."
1,Clearly Partisan,There is nothing here that is of interest except to partisans. If you want a reason to hate Kerry and this is the only thing you can find to hang your hat then go for it...Although George Bush being officially listed as AWOL from the Air Force Reserve is explained as he didn't know that after 4 years of alledged service in the Texas Air National Guard he was supposed to finish the 6 year commitment with the reserves which is why he didn't show up is a far more serious charge but I won't base any vote on anything that these young men did 40 years ago Viet Nam.
4,Truly Unfit for Command!,"If what is revealed in these pages is true I believe John Kerry to be a very scary man, who is truly unfit to command America. Anyone interested in polotics and/or current events should seriously consider reading this book."
4,Astonished,"I read the book and was astonished at the information and stories outlined. Do I believe all of it, no. But even if 1/10th of the information is true, it would be a catastrophe to have an opportunist like John Kerry as our Commander in Chief."
1,Complete BS,"This is no more a fact based book than Farenheit 911 was a documentary. I very much care who is voted president, but I will not base my decision on books like this. John Kerry served in Vietnam and that is more than Bush and Cheney can say about themselves. If you intend to read this book, it's most likely because you are a republican and would like to see John Kerry's record smeared in any way possible."
1,"Unfit, compared to what?",It's very unnerving to know that there are still educated human beings out there who would rather have a mentally handicapped barbarian like Bush in office.
1,Another side of the story.,"I'm giving this book one star because it was written by someone who was picked by the Nixon administration to challenge everything negative John Kerry said about the Vietnam Conflict. My rating shouldn't be misconstrued as an attempt to get people to stay away from it. On the contrary, I believe people should read it. Much like Fahrenheit 9/11, there are some facts contained within this book. It is up to the reader to discern fact from diatribe. I watched O'Neill try to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavett show. It seems as if O'Neill is still trying to win a point against Kerry. O'Neill may have some important things to say, but he needs to learn how to say them in a more constructive/less vindictive way."
1,Written by two men with impeccable character...,"John E. O'Neill's links in the GOP go back to his days as ""protégé of Nixon-era dirty trickster Charles Colson""Jerome Corsi on Islam: ""a worthless, dangerous Satanic religion""* on Catholicism: ""Boy buggering in both Islam and Catholicism is okay with the Pope as long as it isn't reported by the liberal press""* on Muslims: ""RAGHEADS are Boy-Bumpers as clearly as they are Women-Haters -- it all goes together""* on ""John F*ing Commie Kerry"": ""After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?""* on Senator ""FAT HOG"" Clinton: ""Anybody ask why HELLary couldn't keep BJ Bill satisfied? Not lesbo or anything, is she?"""
1,Author lacks Objectivity / Credibility,"I stopped reading this book partway in disgust. The author's lack of objectivity is immediately apparent, in the wording of allegations and the way he fails to present any evidence contrary to his claims.The author claims that Kerry was not under fire during the enagement for which Kerry was awarded the Bronze Star.Yet military records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the author, Larry Thurlow himself, was awarded a Bronze Star during the same engagement for coming to the aid of a disabled swift boat WHILE UNDER FIRE.That pretty much destroys the author's credibility. I don't think I'll be picking this book up again anytime soon."
1,Ridiculous,This book is a joke. None of these guys even served on the same boat as Kerry. It would be like the guy who worked in another department of your company or who came after you writing a book about you. O'Neil has long been a right wing wacko who even the Republicans had nothing to do with. Now they are using him as his coruupt buddies as shills for the party.
1,Great,"This details how Kerry got out of Vietnam by using family ties to get into the national gaurd and then going AWOL. Oh, wait...."
1,Disapointing to the max,"I'm not a big fan of Kerry. For a president, we could really do a lot better. But then again, against the backdrop of GWB II, he seems like George Washington. I read this book hoping for some real info- some people support still support Bush, even after 4 years of tremendous error, so I wanted to see what was bad about Kerry... And I did not get my answer in this book. This book was very disapointing and very fuzzy in it's ""facts."" not reccomended."
3,where's my book?,"I will be happy to review this book, if I ever receive my copy of it, that is. I haven't had this much trouble getting ahold of a book since I tried to find a copy of ""The New Soldier"". Funny how difficult it is to get your hands on anything that portraysComrade Kerry in a less than favorable light. I bet Amazon wouldn't have any trouble shipping me a copy of 'Tour of Duty'. (the Fedex man should be here any minute now) I gave 'Unfit for Command' 3 stars for the looney picture of Kerry on the cover."
1,Ridiculous,"This is book is unfit to be published. Based on fabrications, lies, and distortions, you might as well watch FOX NEWS to get more accurate information. This is absolute trash and a worthless piece of writing. Don't bother."
1,"For ""KB,"" Bush-lover nutjob","KB, we don't need uneducated, extremist wackjobs like you in our military. You are a disgrace to the institution. You sound more like the taliban than an American to me."
1,"""John Hobbs""","This, from a man whose other review consists of debating which villian was best on ""GI Joe"".Great political mind there."
1,Utter Lies - An attempted political hatchet job,The facts are clear. These people never served with Joh Kerry in Vietnam. They never even layed eyes on him in Vietnam. This isn't even a well written bunch of lies. It's poorly written and intellectually uninspiring. A waste of money.
1,"Biased, Boring B.S.","I made it halfway through this piece of crap before I pulled out my piece, stood at attention and was ""at ease,"" if you get my meaning.(My copy is already on sale at Amazon.com, it will be the one listed under ""fine."")None of these men ever served with Kerry, some weren't even in the service at the same time he was (including the author), and the only way that Bush can win the election is to try and discredit Kerry's war record, like his ""men"" (and I use the term loosely here), did to McCain and Cleland before them. People keep forgetting that, whatever Kerry did, at least he had the guts to serve while Bush stayed home and didn't even finish out his time in the National Guard.Kerry was a war hero, Bush was a draft-dodger, end of story! And any real vet would see it that way."
1,Too bad...,"...most of the people involved in the writing of this book either didn't serve in 'Nam at all or didn't serve anywhere NEAR John Kerry. Also, it's really sad that most of what is in the book has either been debunked/disproven and/or cannot be proven as there are not records supporting the claims made in the book.Don't waste your money."
2,Should be classified as Fiction according to the facts,"Unfortunately the records don't support all of Mr. O'Neil's Claims but he sure is making a lot of money off of all of you right wing kooks who love to find someone to hate especially if they don't agree with your view of the world and you would like history rewritten to fit your view. Deny it all you want but war crimes were the norm there with whole villages wiped out (4 million vietnamese were killed and they weren't all evildoers) By the way maybe Mr. O'Neil can tell us where George W. was when all this was happening, the Alabama National Guard would sure like to know. General Turnipseed sure couldn't find him and about 200 other enlistees sure don't remember seeing him. So if your talking about the character of these two men and you choose the guy who couldn't even show up for roll call what does that say about you?"
1,"Insulting to ""True"" Veterans","As a disabled veteran, I am insulted to read trash like this. While my military background keeps me aboard the conservative party... it's amazing what folks will print/support during election time. I really wish everyone would focus on ""issues"" rather than conjuring-up campfire stories."
1,Smearboaters wouldn't know the truth . . .,"if it bit them on the behind. The only vets who oppose Kerry on non-partisan grounds (the rabid Repubs don't base their opinions on facts, but on their opposition to Kerry; they find reasons to reinforce their predisposition to follow the party line) have been hoodwinked into believing that Kerry issued some sort of broad indictment of Vietnam vets back in the '70s. It didn't happen. The atrocities that Kerry referred to in his testimony before Congress were quotes from the Winter Soldier Investigation, in which 150 Vietnam vets themselves confessed to having participated in such atrocities."
1,extra extra read all about it,"67.3% of all stats are made up.For instance, by Diebold.Nonetheless...A new poll shows 98% of Americans would prefer a dead squirrel to a chimp."
5,Amazon Bias,"Let me guess, who Amazon wants in Washington.All the anti Bush books out there and you have rules.One book that questions Kerry and the rules don't apply.I guess I will find another book store."
5,About time,"An excellent, well documented book. The Bay Hap river incident involving Kerry helps me understand why Kerry's immediate shipmates support him. I would not want to admit running of in my boat either, while leaving the other swifboats to help the mined swifty. Highly recommend this book. And Challenge Kerry's buddies to a lie detector test along with O'Neill and his group. I doubt Kerry's buddies will."
1,my review,"It is unfortunate that information like this is published without reviewing all of the facts. It is plain that not all of the evidence in this book is accurate. One certainly should not believe everything one sees or reads. One should only read this book with the idea that the information is extremely biased. With that being said, none of the political rhetoric that is flung from either camp is necessarily accurate. I did see Fahrenheit 911 as well, and found that equally distasteful in regards to one-sided opinions. Some information might be true on both fronts, but that doesn't mean it all is. Oh well, that's politics for you."
1,This book is full of garbage.,Almost everything in this book has been discredited. Why does Amazon continue to promote it. It makes me never want to use your services again.
1,Garbage and Lies--Buy Kitty Kelley!,"If you are a right-wing robot that watches Fox news and reads the Drudge report--buy this book. If you have a brain, don't waste your money."
1,No credibility,The publisher is a notorious source of right-wing spin. The authors and their sources have been discredited by the facts. They contradict their own previous statements. This book crosses the spin-line into unvarnished lies.
1,yawn,"Bush has no accomplishments to run on so instead he smears the competition. So transparent, so desperate. Next thing you know they'll be saying a vote for Kerry means we'll be attacked again. Oh wait, they are! The stupidity of the average American is hilarious."
3,Scorched Earth,"When politics are an earnest debate over issues of the day, and civility constrains us from overactive prejudice we are all well served. This book is a commentary not on John Kerry's service in Viet Nam, but on his testimony about war crimes when he returned to America. It is understandable that many veterans of that war would feel that he was directly accusing them of committing war crimes. It is unfortunate that in an effort at vengeance for that testimony these veterans would commit themselves to prejudice events they were not personally present to attest to. Their anger is understandable, but unfortunate."
5,History Goes to the Victors,"As a high school history teacher, I was impressed by the high quality of the prose as well as the careful juxtaposition of Kerry's self-embellished record and the oral/written testimony of those Swifities who remember his service quite differently. Current historical scholarship has made much of the value of oral histories as a way to present the record of the ""victims"" of history--particularly those such as Native Americans or slaves in the 19th century. Historians regularly promote these alternative histories with relish, usually because they want to emphasize the horrible exploitation of those who, they assert, have suffered under western imperialist and capitalist oppression,etc. I will be watching how the academic community and the media respond to the oral histories of a group of decorated veterans who have nobly decided to correct the official record."
1,Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Joh,"This book was a waste of money and time. I thought I would get a serious and factual discussion of Kerry's record in Vietnam but discovered after buying the book that John O'Neil (who by the way was not really the author it was someone named Corsi) was simply not telling the truth or as he would say ""lying"" about Kerry's record. The book is based on allegations made by, except for one person, people who never served directly with Kerry and had no first hand knowledge, while it seems that Kerry's official record is supported by all the other people who served directly with him and did have first hand knowledge. Then I find out that this guy and his organization are connected to the Bush campaign by people and money and that the publisher is a conservative Republican organization. I am almost embarassed to say that I bought this book but I felt I should warn the unsuspecting - just call me sucker don't be one yourself."
1,Fair and Balanced For Morons.,Gotta love the conservatives taking us back to the 1950's. Lets blacklist everyone who doesn't like the president. Who cares about the constitution. Let's put all the Arabs in concentration camps like we did to the Japanese in WWII. (EXTREME SARCASM) in case the dim witted republicans couldn't pick up on that.
1,Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them,"There is not a single truthful piece of information in this nasty book. Why it is a bestseller, I have no idea except that people who toadie up to any Republican cause must be hoarding copies in their basements. For all I know, Bush diverted a couple of million from one day in the war in Iraq and is buying them up to use for some other nefarious purpose--perhaps to put ""My Life"" slipcovers on them and burn them in front of the Reischstag...uh, I mean Capitol Building."
1,Shame on Amazon,"I have read enough about this book to know it's pure smear. How can any honest company sell such stuff. And what is the purpose of it all? Four more years for Mister Simple Mind and his cronies. Has he not already screwed up enough? Certainly, the world has become LESS safe because of their politics. But this kind of insight is apparently easier to obtain from the outside. It's always frightening to see how badly informed the average American is when it comes to world affairs."
3,Unfit to think,The review written by Robert M. has to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Is it possible to take someone's voting privileges away for being stupid? Where do they get this stuff?!!
1,O'neil is a Texas Fat Boy just looking for his 15 minutes,"He really should get a life and stop living the only thing that he must feel he did correctly. A war no one in the United States should have been involved in, that really does not need to be part of the US's choices today for an election in 2004. He needs to crawl back into the stink hole of a city (Houston) he lives in and continue to represent good ole' boys' network."
1,This book and it's authors are now entirely discredited,"Slanderous, libelous, anti-American, untruthful. O'Neill waves his partisan flag in a desperate attempt to sway voters in the upcoming election away from Kerry. Even more simply put, a nakedly shameful package of fabrication and malicious twaddle."
1,more lies from Mr. Bush,"Apparently, the president and his lackies aren't accustomed to dealing with facts. This is just another example of lying to the American people (and the world). I recommend that all voters read this one: All the President's Spin : George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truthinstead of wasting their time.Chris"
1,Who IS Regnery Publishing?,"What we really need is an expose of who's behind Regnery Publishing.Won't some journalist follow the money? Who finances them? Who is their CEO, Publisher, who sits on their board? For years they've been raking (false) muck - from Bill Clinton's state troopers to conspiracy theories about Vince Foster's suicide. This is propaganda right out of the Hearst era and the public deserves to know who and what this company is all about!"
1,It's true what they say...,"...that a fool and his money are soon parted. The folks that wrote and published this book are laughing all the way to the bank. I wish *I* could think up a shameless pack of lies and get a bunch of sheep to plunk down $20 a pop to drool over it. Apparently, it's not that hard to do."
1,John Kerry is an American Hero,"There are few things less patriotic than impugning the honorable actions of an American soldier, especially one who exposed himself to enemy fire to save a fellow American's life.This book was published in the months leading up to the 2004 election by men who clearly believe that Kerry somehow fabricated his stories of bravery and didn't deserve his medals. The trouble is, there are several men out there who remember what John Kerry did-- and back him up. So why are the authors so sure?The whole matter is distasteful and bizarre: the person who benefitted most from this work was George W. Bush, who avoided Vietnam and partied away in the South during the 1970s. Most of Bush's cabinet avoided the war as well, for various reasons.As such, this book is little more than political hatchet work at its most basic level."
5,well documented and persuasive,i found the book well written and compelling. there are several incidents which are examined in detail. the picture that emerges is of kerry as a poor swift boat captain who promoted himself at the expense of the truth.all the rucus in the press about this book is well founded. the american voters have a right to know the kind of commander in chief kerry would be.judge for yourself.
1,Unfit for command,"Full of undocumented claims by individuals who were no where near the action that is documented, it appears to me to be election year smears which follow the usual pattern we have seen in many previous elections. ""Dirty tricks"" is the name of the game and here is another one. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1,Swift Boat Veterans for Perjury,"By this time even the blindest neo-con must have some inkling that the charges in this book are closer to fabricated than merely exaggerated. If this book represents the Values of America that the extreme right are always trumpeting, it's not an inviting prospect. This book ignores two fundamental facts; Kerry was at worst braver than average in his Vietnam service, and more than brave to speak out against the war afterwards.Let alone any comparisons that can be made to his rival."
1,More truth......,"These guys did not serve w/ Kerry, many never met him. Several of the officers have recanted their words and admit Kerry was a hero. And this group's funding comes from texans close to Bush and Rove and prominent republicans. Their lawyer just resigned from being the Bush campaign's counsel.And....what was Bush doing? Hiding out in a swank reserve unit and not even showing up. He got in w/ family pull and got saved from court-martial w/ family pull."
1,This rant is now obsolete,"I read this book a week ago and have found the vast majority of its alleged facts to have now become obsolete. New eyewitneeses, new documents and new contradictory statements from previously-identified witnesses make the book woefully incomplete and outdated.If you want to know all the facts, there many other sources including MSNBC, Newsweek, etc."
1,Smear Campaign,Anyone who believes this book to be 100% accurate should keep in mind that it is a biased account of what really happened in Vietnam. I support Kerry because he atleast went to Vietnam. What did Bush do? Not much.
1,Propaganda,"This book was a a disgusting bunch of propaganda thrown together in an effort to disparage Sen. Kerry. Where have these people been the past 30 years if they had such a problem with his medals? Could it be that they feel threatened NOW,during election year, since their candidate has ruined the US's credibility and put us in even more danger??? This book is GARBAGE, poor and simple. Freedom of the press, yes, but it's shameful what some people will stoop to."
5,I just bought some baloney - Outstanding !!,"I've bought so many pretend copies, it should be the number one bestseller of all time !!! A Nobel Prize winner !!! Yeah, that's the ticket !!!!"
5,One of the great documents in American History,"Great because of the impact it will have on a critical election. Great because of the truth it brings to light. Great because of the dedication, integrity and guts of the swift boat veterans who have contributed to it and made it available to the public (U.S. and around the world). Some critics of this book have questioned the timing of its appearance. My theory is that as long as John Kerry was playing his phony Vietnam record in senate campaigns limited to a Massachussetts audience, his misrepresentations remained below the national radar. Once he became his party's nominee for national office, swift boat veterans from all fifty states realized what he was doing and immediately raised the alarm. I thank those veterans who have given us the benefit of their observations and concerns. The preponderance of the evidence validates their claim: ""John Kerry is Unfit for Command!"""
5,1 star Kerry supporter is in the miniority (Just like last November),"Isn't it obvious that this one star reviewer who so frequently reposts over and over is really just one person? So not only are 1 star reviewers in the miniority, in this case, the 1 star reviewer is the one and only Kerry fan. Even the most lavish Kerry supporters have given up on this guy.And even last year when Kerry's popularity was at it's peak, Kerry supporters where also in the miniority. To wit, Kerry lost by more than THREE AND ONE HALF MILLION VOTES! WOW! Holy Shellacking Batman!So now Kerry has one fan left. Oh well......"
1,Why let the truth get in the way of a right-wing rant?,"""Unfit for Command"" says nothing true or accurate about John Kerry's Vietnam experience.This book is part of a larger campaign to discredit Kerry's service in Vietnam and, by association, his candidacy. The mud-slinging by Corsi and O'Neill and others is so vile and untruthful that it earned a strong rebuke from Sen. John McCain, who, despite the fact that he is a Republican and campaigning with President Bush, felt the need to speak out, calling this sort of thing ""dishonest and dishonorable.""It is a matter of fact that neither of the two authors of ""Unfit for Command"" served with Kerry in Vietnam. Of the six men who did actually serve on the swiftboat Kerry commanded, five support his candidacy and one is deceased.But, hey, why let the truth get in the way of a right-wing rant?"
1,Absolute Garbage,"The Authoritarian Right Wing will do anything to hold onto power and dismantle our democracy,.They did it to John McCain, assassinated his character and destroyed his campaign for President.They did it to Senator Max Cleland who lost his legs and 1/2 and arm in VietnamNow they are back and doing it again with a totally baseless and badly written book that assassinates the character of an American Hero."
1,Garbage,"Do not believe this book! Utter garbage. This is not the truth, it is O'Neill's and Corsi's version of the truth, biased as it is. They are trying to push their right wing agenda through this book.Some of Corsi's thoughts on Kerry:""First let's undermine the US in Vietnam. Then we can go for gay marriage. When you get to be Pres. JFK-lite, there will be no end to how much of America we can destroy.""""Just don't let anybody put a tablet with the Ten Commandments in front of the school where that girl wants to wear a Muslim scarf -- OH, No --- then the RATS would complain. Anti-Christian, Anti-American -- just like their Presidential Candidate -- Jean Francois Kerrie.""After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"
1,Is it any wonder?,Is it any wonder that Republicans are trying to tarnish John Kerry's war record? Dick Cheney got six deferments from Vietnam and George W. Bush went AWOL from his National Guard service!
1,Rightwing propaganda,"This is hardly a serious book, just stories told by people with a partisan axe to grind."
5,Kerry is bigger than God! Kerry walks on water!,"What can I say, Kerry lied while good men died and still has people thinking he is some kind of hero. Kerry claims to be a catholic yet is Pro Abortion which is against the catholic religion. Kerry gets paid $140,000/year as a senator, yet, in the last 21 years he had missed almost every meeting!Kerry is bigger than God! He walks on water! Only Kerry could pull this off. And they call Clinton Slick Willy????"
5,"The ""Real"" Kerry is Exposed","This book will lighten up your eyes. As a physician, I(and other physicians) disagree with Kerry's selection of Edwards as his running mate. Sen Edwards is no friend of a doctor. Prior to becoming a senator, he was considered the ""king"" of medical malpractice in the entire state of North Carolina. He developed a knack for suing OB physicians for babies born with cerebral palsy. Long ago, in medical school, I and many students were taught that cerebral palsy develops in the mother and has nothing to do the physician's care. But Edwards was able to manipulate the jury and win multi-millions in these wrongful lawsuits. This is a terrible shame."
1,a book written by a longstanding adversary of Kerry ...,"... apparently full of testimonials of people that DID NOT serve with Kerry ... why on earth would I - or anyone - want to read it to ""find out the truth"" about his conduct in Vietnam? On top of which, it is supposed to tell us whether or not Kerry is fit to be President of the US 30 years later? Is there nothing more substantial Kerry oponents can come up with as to why Kerry might be a bad choice? Apparently not. In which case I can only say: GO KERRY!"
1,Gounds for a Lawsuit,"I took the time to read this book and I was surprised at how many baseless accusations were thrown around with no substantial proof and the proof that is offered is manufactured. Turns out, the men sharing these 'memories' did not know John Kerry at the time. O'Neill had a bigger axe to grind, as a Republican who worked for Nixon; John Kerry had deftly defended his positions on television while all O'Neill did was get snarky. O'Neill seems to have been bitter ever since. I say, John Kerry has grounds for a slander and defamation suit since just about all of this book has been disproved. Funny, that the money for this project came from Republican organizations."
1,I agree with AZ Reader... five star reviewer can't answer the questions!,Three more nonresponses.Total so far: twelve.
4,Interesting and well documented,"Unfit for Command lays out a very convincing account of John Kerry's service in Vietnam. The sources are all well documented, and some of the sources are from John Kerry himself. The book is a must read for people wanting to know more about this presidential candidate."
1,Author Jerome Corsi is a racist,"He has used the ""n"" word in my presence, not to mention other slurs against Jews."
5,Re: Swift Boat Veterans,"It's so interesting to see all the John Kerry supporters on this site who claim that this book has been discredited yet they can't actually proove any of their claims. Here's the deal, all you liberal sheep that vote for whatever clown your party puts out there, there is one simple thing that will prove that what the Swift Boat Veterans claim is untrue, have your boy Kerry release his military record to the public, the full record not the few pages that are on his website that he doctored and have no real useful information. Either put up or shut up. The reason he has not defended himself or released his record is because he knows how damaging it would be!!1"
1,Proven lies,"An out an out smear campaign against a decorated war hero, simply becasue he's running for President against a party of chicken hawks.These men didn't ""serve with"" Kerry on his missions or on his boat or in his crew. Most of them praised his service as recently as last year. William Rood was in the mission in question and backs up Kerry's recount as well as military records.Shameful and disgusting. Kerry had every right to protest a war he fought in. He's an American and that's called freedom of speech. When he could have gotten deferments, he volunterred."
1,"Bush is an AWOL, lying coward","How interesting that the Repug candidate/Resident showed his contempt for the military first by cowardly refusing to volunteer for Vietnam combat duty, as Kerry did, then skipped out, going AWOL from his cushy rich-kid assignment, never to return for required makeup drills (as his own military records prove). He then lied about it in his autobiography.Then he has the dishonor to question the service of a REAL veteran, whose stellar record is supported by the military and his fellow crewmembers. Only a lowclass thug would support such a scumbag as Bush.Your guy is an AWOL lying coward.Your guy is an AWOL lying coward.Your guy is an AWOL lying coward."
1,NOT ONLY BIASED BUT BORING...,"This book could have made it's point in half of it's length. The extra length lends itself to some pretty petty charges, such as Kerry borrowed army jeeps to ""have a good time in Saigon. "" Wow. Some real Watergate material here. The people who keep raving it up keep seeming to forget that at least Kerry served while Bush got out of the war altogether.You'll get halfway through it then want to give yours up at the used section at Amazon.com, like I did (and, at last count 103 others). Buy it if you want, but personally I'd wait till it gets to the bargain bin, people (which should be soon)."
1,Burning Bush,The terrorists dislike Bush. The violent acts commited by these terrorists are due to the fact that George W. Bush is president of the United States. The attacks happened exactly when George W. Bush took to office. With John Kerry as president we wont need to worry about threat's of this magnitude.
1,A bag full of lies,"This is the kind of garbage that worked for w against Senator McCain in SC in 2000, and is a staged bit of utter poop for the gullible or ""conservative"". I'd give it minus stars if that were possible."
1,What a load of cr*p!,"This bunch of hard-core Republicans, right-wing whiners, and others with a very clear ax to grind (virtually every one of them is directly tied to George W Bush and the Republican party), is mad at Kerry for being anti-war. That overshadows everything they have to say...specifically including their so-called ""remembrances"" of John Kerry in Vietnam. You'll also notice that, while they very carefully couch their ""eyewitness"" accounts, virtually none of them were ever close enough to Kerry to know what he did and when he did it. O'Neill, particularly, is described as having taken over Kerry's swift boat ""after"" Kerry's departure. It's a typically shoddy, shameless, and poorly-crafted political polemic. Worth avoiding at ALL costs."
1,Interesting Reading but just not true.,"Kerry says the book is false. The men under Kerry's command say the book is false. U.S. Navy records say the book is false. Guess what? The book is false!After returning from the Viet Nam War, John Kerry told everyone who would listen about the ""war crimes"" he observed committed by American troops. Many of those troops lives were affected by his comments after the war. Now they see an opportunity to get him back for making ""traiterous statements""30 years ago. That's all it is..."
1,Hysterical pack of lies.,Lumpy red this to me. I thought it was reel funny. A great work of fiction. Glad Karl paid for it. Needs more pictures though.
1,0 Stars,"Geez. First the Brown Water Rat-finks and now the mocking Purple Heart bandages? How do you people sleep at night?This book is of 0 intellectual value. It's a hate-filled smear fest written by thugs secretly hired by George W. Bush. If you value the truth you won't bother reading this piece of trash. Don't be a mindless sheep, and please don't read this book."
1,Can't believe Bush is now dividing vets to get elected.,"Rove at it again, thinnly disguised use of vets who are sour on Kerry for anti-war activities. Shame on anyone who tries to belittle service to our country. What does it say to those in Iraq and everywhere else. If you choose to run for office your service will be discounted. Bush runs on ""family values"" but he lets his friends do all the dirty work. What a total disgrace. He needs to pray for forgiveness because he is not getting the message."
1,"Lies, distortions, a political smear campaign in hardcover.","I read the book, and then read others, including ""Fortunate Son"" George W. Bush and the making of a President, by J. H. Hatfield. I also read all of the political posts from both candidates sites. This leads me to believe that I bought a fiction book, not a non-fiction. Official records (where Senator Kerry is involved) all disagree with Mr. O'Neill's versions of what happened. Mr. Corsi has had his background revealed (he HAD to apologize) and so I have used the book as 'kindling' SAVE YOUR MONEY. It's cheaper to buy a bag of charcoal than hardcover 'kindling'."
1,Liars Exposed,"Now that the liars who wrote this book have been exposed, wouldn't it be best to reclassify it as ""Fiction,"" where it belongs."
1,Iraq and Afghan Veteran For Truth,"Ignoble, unworthy, bilious - the author and his supporters are muddying the waters surrounding the real issues of the campaign: those being the war in Iraq, the security of the American people, and the economy. The author uses quotes that have been proven spurious in the press and quotes men attacking Kerry who praised him less than a year ago. The leader of the SBVFT is a longtime operative and the main supporter a Friend of Rove. This is unworthy drivel. This is not what America needs to be reading in the run-up to what should be the most important election of a generation."
1,Swift Boat Veterens for Bush,I am a liberal. I read both sides to get the facts rather than the spin which both sides are guilty of. This book will not stand the test of time. These are partisans pretending to be otherwise. There are many Republicans that I respect that do not use these tactics to win at all costs regardless of the truth. Bush and Cheney are different. The TRUTH should mean more than what this administration and it's minions represent as the truth.
1,garbage,should be off the shelf with Author Norma Khuri's Honor Lost.A bitter work of fiction by a former ex-Nixon employee.
1,Propaganda Rubbish,"The author does not hide his conservative credentials and this book is in some way a strong attack based on John Kerry and his vietnam era actions.John Kerry's brave efforts in Vietnam are well documented and he was rightly rewarded with three purple hearts by the military and was honourably discharged,yet the author John O Neill shamelessly decides to slander a Veteran like Kerry and demean his service record with no proof whatsoever.Interestingly o Neill friend is GW Bush who is well known for dodging the draft by using his Dad's connections and treating the national guard like a joke by not reporting for duty.This book is just shameless partisan conservative rubbish and should be dumped."
1,What a tool,"If you are reading this book, you would be far better off going back to work on completing your high-school education or your GED. Educated people can see through this crap a mile away."
5,CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!,I had ordered Unfit For Command from Amazon.com. It has not been delievered as yet.After reading your nasty political veiwpoint of the book I want to cancel all dealings with your company.My books will be purchased from Costco from now on!Thank youJoyce Edwards
1,"Sloppy, Self-Serving Attack","As The New York Times and The Washington Post have both written this week, the ""facts"" supporting this attack on Kerry have shifted considerably in the 33 years the author has been slinging mud at Kerry. This ""book"" should be listed as Fiction, since there is no category called Lies."
1,Lack of Objectivity is Stifling,This book is one of the pathetic excuses of the GOP & Bush to discredit a truly honorable man. Kerry is a war hero and a true American. I look forward to his presidency and an end to the lies that Bush has been espousing throughout his term.
1,Fictitious Smear,"There is nothing truthful about this book. Written by a Republican hack, this lying diatribe is the most shameful excuse for a book to be printed in a long time. The outrageous assertions put forward in this heap of garbage have been utterly disproved by those who were actually there, the public record and previous statements by many of the contributers. Don't waste your money on this utter trash."
1,Yet another set of lies from the Bush smear machine,"This book has been discredited in so many ways, it shouldn't even be necessary to point out what utter crap it is. One of the veterans has retracted his comments. The others didn't serve with Kerry, unless that means they were in Vietnam at the time. The man who claims to remember treating Kerry for his first Purple Heart award isn't listed in any of Kerry's medical records -- and for some reason claims to remember, in detail, what he claims is a thoroughly minor wound. Out of all the ones he did treat. Right. This book is a joke brought to you by the same people who slandered McCain in South Carolina in 2000."
5,Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Joh,"So we can say what we want about this book, with little or no constraint? You should be ashamed of your self Amazon. I don't care if you let criticism be posted ad homonym, but do it across the board. I think until you do this I will no longer Buy or sell any books with you. I will sell my books on EBay's Half.com. This is truly the stupidest policy I have ever seen or heard of from a business that makes its living on free speech, and the promotion of literary works sold here.P.S. Tell a friend, I will (Six degree of separation)"
1,Wingnut Trash,"These swift boat veterans did not serve with Kerry. O'Neill is a political partisan who has exclusively contributed to the Republican party. His co-author John Corsi has been unmasked as a bigot by his comments posted on the website Freerepublic. Don't buy this book, save your money. You may need it for prescription drugs when you retire with the paltry Republican medicare benefits."
1,Don't be deceived,"This book has been discredited by reputable journalists as a web of lies spun and packaged and paid for by millionaire Texans who are longtime Bush family contributors and supporters, and by Vietnam veterans who feel so betrayed by Kerry's antiwar activities of the early 1970s that they feel compelled to destroy his reputation by rewriting history. Read the five-page New York Times dissection of the background of the book, published in the 8/20/04 edition of the Times."
1,Character assassination is one of the game in politics.,"ZERO starIt was clear to me that this book is a pure lie after watch Ted Koppel's ""Nightline"" report. It was pathetic to see John O'Neill holding up the book like a bible and rambling like a drunk driver trying to get out of a speeding ticket.O'Neill asked: ""Who do you trust more, three members of a communist regime that tortured and killed our American troops or a group of more than 280 highly decorated American veterans, who proudly served their country and are now responsible members of their respective communities?'""I'll take the 3 Viet Congs anytime, anyday. Ask yourself, who has the ulterior motives here? The ex-viet congs or O'Neill? 280 member my foot. Are you telling me that all 280 American solider witnese this event? Now that would not be much of an ambush, would it?Who knew? character assassination is not only for political gains but also profitable."
1,Absolute Lies,"I can't believe the nerve of the authors, going after Kerry's service when Bush completely avoided Vietnam. At least Kerry VOLUNTARILY went."
1,Unpatriotic,"If you buy this book, you hate America and don't support the troops. Too stupid to read a newspaper article dealing with politics? Then read this and your head won't hurt from dealing with all that ""thinking for yourself"" crap!This is a collection of silly lies for Republican dummies who are killing themselves trying to find some reason to hate Kerry. Why is anyone still a Republican? Beats me. Must be the racism that attracts you. Or maybe you want the terrorists to win. Anyway, a pox on you all."
1,Unfit for Publication...,"Every word in this book is a lie, including ""and"" and ""the"".This book was written by Jerry Corsi, who says of John Kerry, ""After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judaism? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"" Great, one of the authors is anti-Semitic, insinuating evil, nasty things because Kerry's father was Jewish.One of the other authors, John O'Neill, is a veteran Nixon goon, sent out by Tricky Dick to disparage Kerry when Kerry was speaking out against the Vietnam War. He has ground his axe for over 30 years, itching to write a piece of calumny like this."
1,Propaganda and Puppetry perpetrated on the Public,"This is a hate-filled, fact-free attack on the honorable service of the men and women who serve our country. Anybody who considers this or any current Republican campaign Conservative must also consider Terrorists as the human embodyment of Judeo-Christian ideals. The hypocracy, lies and manipulation in this smear campaign really scrape the bottom of human morality."
1,very sad book,"What a sad waste of time this was. Have we all become so cold that lies pass for public discourse these days? Don't waste your money. I wish I could rescind my own purchase of this book but its too late now.We have fallen to a low state when people can lie so blatantly and make a living at it. Oh, sorry. Those are called pundits these days."
1,You pathetic un-American idiot,"I can't wait until Kerry takes office and you get the proverbial finger. You have the gonads (and Republican funding) to say whatever crap you choose in public (thanks to brave soldiers such as Kerry, fighting for our freedoms of speech) but how do you sleep? Well, without a conscience, sleeping is probably quite easy for you, isn't it? So, grab your blankie and suck your thumb while your daddy George lulls you to sleep. John Kerry told you off on the Dick Cavitt show and you had to cry all the way home to Dick Nixon, didn't you? There must be a lovely place in the hereafter for lying sacks of poo like you! Get a clue and give our country a chance for proper leadership!"
5,Just makes you glad again that Bush was elected!!!,John O'Neill has been a friend of my family for over 25 years. We never even knew about the famous O'Neill-Kerry debate on Dick Cavett until it looked as if Kerry would be the Democratic nominee and John knew he had to do something to stop him!This book is a must read for those of us who seek the truth! All John O'Neill has said is the truth. Remember that John Kerry never refuted one word of this book...guess why...IT'S THE TRUTH...NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!!!! This book and the Swift Boat Vets changed history and told the American public the real story about Kerry and why he should not be elected. We are so grateful that they were successful! Thank God for the Swift Boat Vets and John O'Neill is all I have to say!!!! You will LOVE this book! Fascinating read!!!
1,Disgusting,"I'm the son of a pair of veterans. My father was a fighter pilot in Vietnam and my mother was a nurse stationed in Saigon. I can honestly say that among the Veterans Groups my father belongs too nearly all expressed a collective feeling of disgust and betrayal at the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. The group has almost been extradited and excommunicated by the rest of the Veteran community. How is it that they have all these words for slander about Kerry's war record and yet turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the fact that their hero Dubya saw NO ACTION IN VIETNAM WHATSOEVER and resided comfortably in an Air National Guard base in Texas thanks to his status as a ""fortunate son"" to quote CCR.Don't worry Swift Boat Veterans, that ignorant war mongering cowboy you call a hero defeated Kerry and now we have another lovely 4 years of international anti-American sentiment, bloodshed and false promises."
1,A review of Amazon leads me elsewhere,"RE: the following news item -- I expect that AMAZON willrenounce and revoke this partisan stance and do so publicly.Otherwise, my account will be GONE. I don't spend my moneywhere this kind of bias goes on.If you have a rule, enforce it for all.Otherwise, drop the rule. Selective enforcement is breedingcontempt in my case.------------------------------Restrictions RescindedAmazon.com (search), which prohibits the public from writingpersonal attacks in their online book reviews, has lifted thoserestrictions for the anti-Kerry book ""Unfit for Command,"" tellingcustomers, ""That policy in particular seems to be incompatible withpresidential election year politics.Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. ... Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!""Those restrictions, however, have not been lifted for John Kerry'sbiography, or for the book ""Against All Enemies,"" by Bush criticRichard Clarke, to name a couple."
1,Malarky!,"The fact that this is written by men who never served with Kerry says it all. Their hate just drips off the pages, and it makes me sad for them. To be so filled with anger that they have to tear a hero down just to make themselves feel better. They should be ashamed of themselves."
5,"The TRUTH hurts: ""Kerry's campaign""",These men have every right to speak their minds and state the facts about Kerry's career.ESPECIALLY since Kerry's entire campaign thus far has largely been based upon touting how great his military service was in Vietnam!!!This book brings the devastating facts to light about John Kerry's war record.I'll beleive 19 veterans that served (directly with John Kerry) above the measley 3 that are for him anyday.
1,What were you thinking?,"You ""take no responsibilty"" indeed! Fair debate on the merits of arguments presented in a book is always appropriate, but perhaps never more so than during a presidential election. For you to invite ad hominem attacks on this author alone because we are engaged in an election is the height of stupidity and irresponsibilty. I can only infer you eagerly offer up this man as a target for political reasons. Perhaps his arguments seem dangerously credible and so the need for personal attack. No thanks. You have hereby lost a very active customer."
1,Ann Coulter should know this word--SLANDER!,"It amazes me how the men who served directly under Kerry and were actually ON his Swiftboat say that he is a war hero. Yet this book is filled with ""personal accounts"" from men who NEVER knew Kerry as Jim Rassmann did. It makes me sick how Karl Rove and the Bush Administration can launch this attack on a true war hero. The United States Navy even says Kerry's version of events is the truth. This is slander and Kerry should sue.As for John O'Niell, I think he has lived in the past for so long that he has to make Kerry look bad because Kerry made HIM look bad on the Dick Cavot show YEARS ago. Not to mention John O'Niell NEVER SERVED WITH KERRY! This book should be called what Ann Coulter's best seller was titled---SLANDER!"
1,Brilliant! But one small complaint...,"I thought this book was an incredibly well-written and researched piece of journalistic excellence.However, I have one small complaint. On the cover, under the words ""Unfit for Command,"" there is a picture of Senator John Kerry, a decorated and corageous veteran of the Vietnam War. I'm sure the publisher *meant* to put a picture of President George W. Bush, who spent the much of the duration of the Vietnam War absent from his Air National Guard post. Not to mention killing 1000 of our brave soldiers and countless Iraqi civilians through bald-faced lies thirty years later.Other than that ""Unfit For Command"" is a great book.(Seriously, though, if you absolutely must read this book, steal it. God will forgive you.)"
1,more partisan slime from the right,No one takes this fiction seriously except for Freepers and Rush Limbaugh devotees. Republicans have always needed this sort of smear campaign to muddy the waters because their stand on the issues benefits a segment of society too small to assure their victory. One day the people will wake up and see that they have been manipulated. Let's just hope it not too late.
1,Scathing and hateful,"(...)It's already been proven that one of these guys has completely contradicted himself and even disqualified himself from his own Bronze medal-- but you people keep ignoring this. Two other Vets who knew and was alongside Kerry have come forward over the weekend, supporting him. Where are all the unfavorable reviews gone? I have a friend who wrote something days ago and it has yet to appear!! About that COWARD, George W. and his AWOL status with the National Guard!!!It's been said that every great culture must go through it's ""dark side"" it is sad to see that this is exactly what's going on in America with these hate-filled people and the Corporate powers that be. It's turning into censorship and manipulation of the public mind and it is frightening me and many associates. This book is hideous."
1,Typical Red State Stupidity.,"Why aren't I all upset about Clinton? Because Clinton's not running for president, you ugly douchebag. Your AWOL Resident is.I thought you conservatives were leaving Amazon. Leave already. Go! The sooner the door hits your ass on the way out, the better this site will be. Git, filth."
5,UNFIT TO COMMAND - BRAVO SWIFT BOAT VETS,"A FABULOUS BOOK THAT TOOK ALOT OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION. CUDOS TO JOHN O'NEILL AND HIS SWIFT BOAT VETS FOR PROVIDING INTERESTING INCONGRUITIES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE'S STORIES OF HEROISM AND VALOR IN HIS BRIEF 4 MONTH TOUR OF DUTY. ALL THE LIBERALS WHO DISMISS THIS BOOK AS FICTION OR NONSENSE, SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES WHY THEIR CANDIDATE REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS COMPLETE MEDICAL RECORDS, WHY HE REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS COMPLETE MILITARY RECORDS, WHY HE REFUSES TO DISCLOSE HIS FINANCIAL RECORDS. THIS FROM THE BASTIONS OF OPENESS AND LIBERALISM ??????? IF THIS BOOK AND ITS AUTHORS ARE LYING WHY DIDN'T JOHN KERRY SUE THEM FOR SLANDER AND DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER ??? BE OPEN MINDED READ THE BOOK AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF !!!!!!!!"
5,Amamzon Run by Kneejerk leftists,"Unless Amazon publicly recants the special policy of allowing personal attacks in the reviews of this book and publicly apologizes for its leftist bias I will cancel my account, cancel my credit account, remove Amazon from current bookmarks and relegate Amazon to the trash heap of the web along with all the other wacko sites ou there. All my friends that I have recommended Amazon to over the years will no doubt do the same."
1,Oh give me a break,"This is book is by bitter Vietnam Veteran Republican whelps who were nowhere near Kerry. The Kerry record is out there as well as the testimony of men who served with him on the boat at the time of the battle. If the RNC has any class, it would diavow this attack for what it is: Sour grapes from men who resented Kerry's post-war political activities. And, for the record, Kerry was always respectful of the men who fought, while questioning a system that would send men into danger for what at best was a discredited political theory. But ya' know, the RNC and Republicans in general cannot be expected to be fair minded--they would then have to admit that their commander in chief was appointed rather than elected."
1,Amazon how could you?,"I was going to powder my nose, but do to your policy on this book I refuse! I am a very emotional and sensitive schoolgirl. After reading your policy I simply broke out in tears. I demand a months supply of kleenex!"
1,Unfit For Reading!,"Swift Boat Versions of Truth:""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.""Enough said. I can't believe people are pulling their Amazon accounts because Amazon is allowing both sides to be heard. Suppressing dissenting opinions is really Patriotic."
