4,"Entertaining, but very little as far as ""news"" goes","I really enjoyed this book. I thought that Ms. Robbins did a great job of writing the book so that it read more like a story, with bits of facts (what she thought were facts) mixed in, as well as short stretches of what she does best, journalistic writing. Others wrote the same thing, and mocked the statement, but my experience was nothing like the book. I was interested in the alternate universe that Ms. Robbins wrote about, but disturbed at times. I don't think that parents or prospective sorority members can read ""Pledged"" like it's a cautionary tale or expect that any sorority or university greek system will be at all similar to this book. I respect her for meeting the challenge of writing about sororities and greek life and I was impressed that she attempted to be unbiased."
1,review of Pledged,"Voyeristic and silly but readable. The author didn't seem to feel a need to engage with material she presented, I guess she was being objective? I would have enjoyed a less-insider more socially aware perspective, rather than someone who seemed pretty close to the demographic she was obserbing (pretty, privilleged, non-feminist, somewhat unreflective and not psychologically minded)."
1,"Fallacious, Sensationalized, Exaggerated...","It is clear that Robbins formulated her conclusions before beginning her ""research."" Her ability to tell the truth is severely hampered by her desire to sell books, and the sensationalized story that results is one that makes for great drama, but is a far from accurate depiction of reality. She stultifies the Greek system by seeking merely to perpetuate a stereotype of licentious behavior. In a nationwide Greek system, one can undoubtedly find any sought after ""truth."" The fallacy in Robbins' conclusion is that she applies such ""truths"" to the entire system. The nationwide Greek system is much larger, and more diverse, than the small sample she chose to experience. This ""exposé"" reveals two truths: Robbins lacks objectivity and serious fact-finding ability."
1,Boring!,"I really tried to finish this book, but I couldn't -- I just gave up! It wasn't just incredibly dull, the supposed infractions of these sorority girls were so lame. As a former sorority girl from the 1980s, I guess things were a heck of a lot wilder when I was in school!"
2,Nothing is secret about this,"Unless you went to college that didn't have any kind of sorority life or you are the most naive person in the world this book holds no secrets. There are points were you wonder why this is important because there is no reason for the repetion this book holds. As I said earlier it is a good read for those who know nothing of sororites, but it truly holds no secret for college students like me. I think the writer was looking for a big scandal and came up short."
4,"Overall, a good transaction","Book showed minor signs of wear and was not ""brand new"" as described. However, fast shipping and book was in overall good quality! A good experience."
5,Sororities,"I thought this book was very interesting and a must read for those who are thinking about joining a sorority. While my sorority experience wasn't exactly like the ones in the book described, there were A LOT of similarities."
2,An Account That Doesn't Match My Experience,"I went to a large, southern, greek school, like State U, 16 years ago, and I pledged a sorority as a sophomore. I personally never saw much of the ""scandalous"" stuff go on with my house or with my friend's houses, and we were all in ""top"" houses. Of course there was lots of drinking, days when we didn't go to class in favor of doing something else, make-out sessions with boys and ""cliques"" but that's college whether you're in a sorority or not.I also saw first-hand that girls of all types got bids from houses of all types. I ended up depledging because the experience just wasn't for me (I probably would have stuck with it if I had pledged as a freshman), but I hardly think that sororities are all bad. Robbins didn't seem to do much more than try to prove a bunch of stereotypes as truth with no real proof, just assumptions she pieced together when she couldn't gain access the way she wanted to."
2,Disappointingly Boring,"Never joining a sorority and now out of college, I have been curious about a way of life that I might have missed out on...so I read this book to try to gain some insight. Instead of learning anything new or gaining any insight, this book merely provided me a few tales of girls, boys, and their gossip about both. Ultimately no secrets revealed just like her book on Skull and Bones. Disappointing."
3,Pretty good...,"I tried the Escape your Shape workouts about a year ago (2003) for 4-6 months. I was happy initially, but the workouts are NOT intense enough to take off the weight (only inches), unfortunately. I am now doing workouts that burn anywhere from 400-600 calories and the muscle toning is much more intense and the reps are higher and the cardio workouts are also much harder.At the time of the workouts I was not modifying my diet enough and my sugar-intake was too high as well as the calories. But now, I have modified my diet and with my new workouts I have lost a total of 15 pounds along with a new low-carb diet. Mr. J's book says to do low-carb, but the caloric intake is WAY too low! But, he is right that you do need to workout at least 5-6 days/week to loose any type of significant weight and inches.If you'd like to take a look at some REAL fitness programs go to: www.beachbody.com/mkc51"
1,Line your bird cage with this book,"This book has to be the biggest piece of garbage I've ever come across about exercise advice. Holy cow! Do yourself a favor and don't buy it or read it. The advice is simply not true. If you want to understand how your body reacts to exercise, a really great book to read is this one: The Female Body Breakthrough, the revolutionary strength training plan for losing fat and getting the body you want by Rachel Cosgrove (not just for women, by the way), a real eye-opener."
2,This book is kind of misleading,"He has a point, but after speaking with 2 different Doctor's & one Physical Fitness Certified Instructor - I felt scared to work out the way they told me to. I didn't want to bulk up or increase my already enlarged areas. I followed my Doctors' & Physical Fitness Instructor's advice & I am losing everywhere. Escape your Shape was not working for me, I was not losing like this book said I would. I see others are thrilled with this book, to me it scared me into believing something that wasn't true & it didn't work for me. I have been trying for years and years to lose this excess weight. I now pay my Doctors to help me & it is working without medication, walking for 30 mins 5 days a week & doing my weight bearing excersize on all parts of my body. I hope it works for you, but not for me."
3,Escape your shape,This book is good to have overall. I have been following my shape's workout routine based on this book and I feel better than before. I still go to the gym to workout a few times a week even though this book's regimen does not require any gym equipment. One thing about this book is that it covers all body types that you may not be interested in reading about. For me that was somewhat of an inefficient use of this book. It would be better if there was a book catered for each body type categorized by this author. I also substitued dumbbells for the weight bar as that's less expensive and easier to find.
5,Works for me!,"I read this book a few years ago and took a little of this and a little of that but I didn't follow instructions step by step. After killing myself on the treadmill and with weights and not seeing results, I decided to read completely and follow the hourglass workout step by step. It has worked for me. Two weeks and I can see definition in my stomach that I haven't seen before having children 8 years ago. Don't get me wrong - I don't have a six pack - but definition. I have done every tricep exercise advertised and they still waved when I waved - I can honestly say that this past week I have noticed a difference WOOHOO! I'm excited to step it up a notch this week and hopefully the good results will keep coming."
1,Worst shampoo I have ever used,"I have fine, wavy, color-treated hair. I have used Rusk products in the past, and they were a good product. This shampoo, however, weighed my hair down with a waxy build-up after a week of use. It also made my hair smell funny, like A&D ointment. Not sure what is in this shampoo or what i use on my hair that had a bad reaction with it, but I have a full bottle and I will be throwing it away."
1,NOT for color treated hair,This shampoo was harsh on my fine hair when it was uncolored. I tried it again now that it is colored hoping (after buying this large bottle) that it would work better on colored hair. Left my hair looking and feeling like frizzled straw. Fortunately have a good shampoo now that is keeping my color safe and my hair looking glossy and soft.I gave this to my husband to use (truly doesn't care what goes on his head as long as it cleans :>)) and he doesn't like it either. His thick healthy hair looks bushy and unruly when done. Off to the trash it went.
3,For Fine Oily Hair Only,"I typically use rusk products, but was disappointed with this one. I have normal, fine hair--which normally does well with most shampoos--but this shampoo almost goes so far as to strip my hair. I plan on sticking with Calm shampoo in the future."
1,Awful Product and Company,"Buyer Beware...Purchased the Solvit PupSTEP XT Pet Stairs, which are horrendus. They supposedly can support 250lbs., but my 40lb dog was afraid to use them. They are incredibly flimsy and cheap...DO NOT BUY!When we called AbsolutelyPets to complained, they were unsympathetic. The product came pre-assembled and without a package, unless you consider the shipping box. Because we opened the ""package"" we would have to pay for the shipping and a 20% restocking fee. They do not stand behind their products...I will never purchase a thing from them again!"
4,Really helpful with a 65 pound puppy,"This has really helped with our 65 pound puppy, who is still growing. She's an English bulldog. Picking her up is like trying to pick up a bag of water. The vendor shipped in timely fashion, and included a thank you note for the order. The has saved my back, thanks."
2,Needs More Background,"The Arabs in this film are uniformly shown in a sympathetic way as innocent victims of land confiscation and oppressed by an unfeeling military apparatus. The events leading to occupation are not explored, and there is no mention of Hamas or Hizbollah. Hence, we're left with a highly subective and emotional depiction of a multifaceted conflict."
3,A great book...8 years ago.,It's a testament to the pace of change and the instability of the tween market that this book is so outdated in only 8 years. Mobile and social just weren't around then like they are now.Having said that it's based on solid research and mentalities and needs driven by basic child development are still relevant today.Good foundation. perhaps the author could have gotten to the point earlier and in a more concise manner.
2,This sucks,I got this and the max is 9.2 feet per second with upgrades. The xmod i got for 25.00 goes 12.6 feet per second STOCK. This is just a copy just get the Truck xmods and it will smoke this peice of crap. As i said this is crap a copy
5,"A fun, inexpensive, upgradeable RC truck","For $15, it is a great value. It was fun assembling the wheels and such. I do wish the body would stay on a bit better but it seems to help when crashing into things (no damage). The suspension is capable and the stock motor has enough umphh to go through grass with relative ease. I am going to get the upgrade and I hope it becomes even more fun. It is great on and off-road."
5,best ever,the car super slicks are good but the monster the first was a piece of poop now this one is good because it has better supension and speed the old one whent like 3 mph this goes like 10 or 12 mph with off road kit which is slower than stock but is more powerful with the speed kit it goes like 15 mph but it is exclent.
3,"Cool, but cheap","A nice toy, and fun, but the plastic is not so durable and the body comes off often. Still a good buy if you can get it cheap like I did."
5,Thanks for everything,"This is a great kids book that I read as a child. I am now using it to teach my class. The mail moved slower than a snail, but the book is in awesome shape and the service was awesome."
3,The Ghost Cat Project,"In the beginning of the story, we find out that Annabel has gone to the house of some of her relatives for the summer. She wakes up to the meowing of a cat. She goes outside to find it but it keeps disappearing and reappearing. Later Annabel learns of a story about an old ghost and her ghost cat. She sets out to find out about this ghost and also her own past.On a scale of one to ten, I would give this book a seven. The book kept me interested and was very exciting at parts, but it could have been better. Although I mostly read fantasy books, it was interesting to change styles with a mystery. I think if you haven't read a mystery book in awhile, you should try this one."
4,Pretty Good Chinese Hammer,Good Quality Brass Hammer with a good balance.The hammer was Made in China - I wish that it wasn't
3,"Easy to apply, nice smell, no real shine","The wax is easy to apply (hence the spray bottle). It is also easy to wipe off.The nice smell it has is really noticeable, but not disturbing.Applied it during the summer time to a boat which was waxed professionally at the beginning of the season. There was no additional shine noticed."
5,Wonderful animal set!,"I just bought a set of these at a swap meet. So far, I haven't been able to stop looking at them. No doubt these are meant for kids, but the information given is scientific and thorough. Each animal is photographed several times and there is a range map showing where they live. It tells you about their habitat, what they eat, when they breed and all kinds of interesting information about animals I didn't know existed! I recommend these for anyone who loves animals, not just kids!"
2,i got what i paid for,"well they were prep pads and they did seem to have alcohol on them, but they were very small and after wiping the top of the vial there did not seem to be enough pad or alcohol left to clean the injection area .. were cheap to buy and expensive to use, since I usually end up using two pads / injection..will buy better pads next time i order......."
3,Does the job.,"Nothing amazing, but it does the job. It is a great price since the company offers free shipping. So if you need prep pads it works. It won't be as saturated as other prep pads."
2,Small and thin,As others have noted these pads are both small and thin. Probably only good for injections and cleaning small cuts.
2,Light on the alcohol and a product from China,I just am not a fan of China's quality control standards. The American product is still not available in the stores that I shop at.
5,"Aging Hippies, check this out!",Love this soap! It makes my skin so soft! I can't wait to try other fragrances! Thanks for the samples.
4,Very good quality,This was a little expensive I thought but when I got it I really like the quality of it. My daughter loves it. It's easy for her to use (she's 3) and she has played with it a lot. Would definately buy it again.The only thing that I wish was different is the bottom of the seat rotate's and so the doll looks kind of more like they are folded in half sometimes. But it does rotate down so she looks like she's sitting.
2,Print on demand?!,"The website description does not say this is print on demand, though the inside page clearly states that. For a book lover, this is a very ""dead"" feeling item. I'm returning it."
4,looks great,"I love this bedding. It looks wonderful. The only complant I have is it is hard to center the square on your bed and the duvet cover seems to be bigger then my duvet, although they are both ""king"" size. Other then that, it looks wonderful and I am very happy with it."
4,Very nice but....,"My only complaint is that it is a very thin comfortor. I didn't look close enough at the picture before I purchased it. I highly recommend buying a down comforter to go underneath it, because it is only slightly thicker than sheets. Other than that, I love it!"
3,Weak treatment of a solid subject,"The author's intention is sound: to rid the world of junk (imprecise) English. The need for this is obvious - even the best writers fall prey to redundant or misused words.The organization of the book doesn't support such a grand ambition, though. A dictionary format would seem to be a good way to remedy the problem, but the author slips between types of mistakes and specific words. In doing this, the book becomes hard to follow, and lacks a core theory or concept to follow. Instead, it turns into a list of ""Don't do this...""While I applaud the author's intention, and am a better writer (I hope!) for having read this book, I would have appreciated better delivery. This is not in the league of ""Elements of Style""."
3,"Worthwhile, but not as much fun as I expected.","Smith makes many valid points in this book, detailing many ways in which the language is commonly abused. He doesn't have nearly the sense of humor about the subject as I'd expected, however, and there are a few cases in which I think he disdains a perfectly legitimate usage."
3,Unfortunately dull,"I was a little disappointed by this book since I'm a great fan of Ken Smith. All of his previous books were written on other interesting topics and resulted in some really fun and informative reads (Mental Hygiene, Raw Deal, Roadside America). Junk English succeeds, somewhat, at the informing part. There's a lot of insight into how English is being destroyed . I imagine Ken watching television and obsessively scribbling down his examples. But the book suffers from bad organization. It goes in a mindless alphabetical order, by both offending words and topics. It would help a lot if it went topic by topic. And the entertaining part is almost nonexistant. Sentences pop up here and there giving a glimpse of the fun writer Smith can be, but mostly it does read like a dictionary."
1,Junk Analysis of English,"The premise of this book sounded interesting enough, but sadly, it's just one man's angry ranting over the evolution of a language about which he seems to know precious little. Few if any of his criticisms have any foundation in grammar, linguistics, or logic. Some choice examples: he takes issue with use of the terms 'covert action' and 'pacification,' which he claims are mere euphemisms for 'terrorism' and 'annihilation or slaughter,' respectively. What?! Smith doesn't quite seem to understand that certain apparently identical synonyms actually provide useful nuances in a language, and instead seems to believe that the English language would be better served if it 1) never changed and 2) were pared down to a few hundred words. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Waste of time,This book has no linguistic basis. It is merely the personal preferences of this particular writer. It is tedious and uninspired.
2,A dissapointment,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The subject, on which I have had interest for a long time, certainly lends itself to a detailed discussion and is worthy of careful analysis, all absent here. I had the opportunity to listen to Ken Smith, the author, on NPR a while ago, and was not surprised to discover that he is not very articulate in person.I would love to see this very same topic analyzed by experts in psychology and semiotics, to profundize on the relationship that exists between language and thought processes. As it is right now, this book is an amusing read, but lacks the necessary depth to be trully insightful."
3,More Hits...,"Songs to look for that are great are ""Moja Mi Corazon"", ""Algo Tienes"", ""Lampara Magica"" and ""Ahora Dices Que""."
5,"I laughed, I cried - Amelia and Emerson are back","Now that Peters has gone beyond the original romantic-suspense parody premise, the resonance of 20th century issues is felt within these books. Yes, still funny, and the romance between the long-married Emersons is present, but the realities of Europeans living/working in the middle east is significant in this plot. I'm not sure that I like Ramses very much in his adult incarnation, but his continuing romantic predicament is still developing. (Or maybe it's that I don't find Nefret as interesting as he does.) Still, I had to put this book down to cry repeatedly in the last few chapters. Fans have lived with these characters for 20 years, so I hope Ms. Peters is flattered that we care."
3,Please-no more Amelia!,"It is very clear that Ms. Peters enjoys writing Amelia books. I see also from the reviews posted here that a lot of other people enjoy them. I like them too. But please - can we see more of Jacqueline Kirby or Vicky Bliss? Those are the characters I love! This book was just too much to get through; I found myself skipping whole sections and hoping the next Elizabeth Peters book will be about Jacqueline or Vicky, which unfortunately I see will not be the case. Forgive me, but the Amelia books have turned into rehashes and repeats."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"I'll try to keep it simple... If you have read other books in this series, I can only guess (based on the other reviews) that you will enjoy this book. If this is your first stab at the series (like me) save your time. Most of the book is spent going to dinners, parties and meetings with characters from past books. If you've read them, I'm sure this will be a treat. If you haven't, you might prefer sticking long splinters under your fingernails. When finally something interesting happens, everyone has to return to the house, meet an old friend from some previous adventure, and spend the next twenty pages discussing it. This book became much more enjoyable (and interesting) once I discovered I could skip these parts. Skim it. It's worth maybe 145 of its 430 pages."
3,Not up to the standard we expect from Elizabeth Peters,"This latest in the Amelia Peabody series is,perhaps, just too much of what was once a good thing. I had to work at reading it. The characters are familiar but I feel that we've seen too much of them. They almost are caricatures of themselves."
3,I found the story to be very slow moving. A disappointment,The usual familiar characters are here and it is fun meeting them again. But the real action does not begin until the last 40-50 pages.
5,Complex and satisfying,"I have read all of the Amelia Peabody books and liked them well enough but didn't go out of my way to search them out. However, I became a true fan with this book. Like fine chocolate, it's dark, rich, and satisfying. As our lives often get more complex and yes, sad, with age, so have Amelia's and her family's. Let's allow this brilliant and gifted author the freedom to continue to develop her characters. I'm so happy that she has done just that in The Falcon at the Portal."
5,"Fast paced, exciting --an enjoyable diversion",This was one book that I couldn't put down. The development of the younger characters was delightful. A great relaxing read! Perhaps in the future we will see books focusing on the Vicky Bliss mysteries with the same dedication.
4,"Great characters & mystery, set in Egypt- you can't go wrong","I needed something to read... I read the back cover and it sounded interesting so I bought it. After reading this wonderful book and falling in love with the characters and their almost comedic tendency to become embroiled in who-done-its, I realized that this was the latest in a series of Amelia Peabody mysteries. I immediately ran out and bought the entire series to read from start to finish. Lion in the Valley was out of print so I scoured used book stores for it. Now I have read all the books in the series and recommend them to everyone!"
1,Enough already!,"The early books in this series were cute. However, they have become unbelievably predictable and boring. There is almost no plot in this novel because it is driven by character. Unfortunately for Ms. Mertz, her characters are tedious. In this book we are treated to interminable discussions of women's rights, not so funny comedic interludes between Ramses and Nefret, the same tired interactions between the senior Emersons, and a host of boring secondary characters. If you haven't read any books in this series try the early ones and forget the rest. Ms. Mertz--it's time for you to send this series over the falls. And, unlike Sir Arthur, don't bring it back."
1,Can I be the only one who hated this book?,"Maybe I just don't have a taste for English mysteries. Maybe this book loses a lot when you listen to it on tape, as I did. Whatever happened, this book was a real trial. The characters were more irritating than charming, the plot was a clumsy mixture of any generic Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes story, and the dialogue was contrived. On top of all that, the Egyptian characters were almost insultingly shallow, suitable only for doing the hard work (if they were the good guys) or being messily killed, if they were on the other side. Maybe this was Peters' way of showing British colonial attitudes, but I found it grating. Finally, the heroine's continual ejactulations of her signature ""Good Gad!"" drove me downright mad. One more little annoyance in a book full of them."
5,Like spending time with an old friend,"There are no significant new characters developed in this, the tenth of the Amelia Peabody series, nor any significant changes in the behavior of established characters. But fans of Amelia and the Emerson households will enjoy spending time with their old friends as they work their way through another Egypt-based mystery. And there are enough plot twists and unexpected scenes to add interest. Readers unfamiliar with Amelia will still enjoy the story, which can stand on it's own, but would better enjoy it after reading the series in publication order."
4,This is a must-read for anyone.,"I read this book several years ago and have been looking to buy it again after my original copy was lost. I love this book, I was swept into these women's lives and felt their love, their sorrow, and their pain. I think it is well written and would recommend to anyone."
3,6-month treatment,you must use this product religously for six months to see results. Anything less IS a waste of money
5,Wonderful CD!,"For those of you who haven't given Jan a listen, please do! His voice is wonderful and the songs are unique enough to keep you listening to this CD over and over. Particular songs that stand out are ""Lobo Solitario"", ""Ella y Yo"", ""Un Corazon Que Me Abrace"" and ""El Mar No Calla"". This man has incredible talent and I encourage non-Spanish speakers to try this too(as well as any CD by Gustavo Lara), you'll be hooked!"
1,the publishing date should be correted !,"Hi the Author and Amazon team, you should correct the publishing date."
5,A Sure Bet,"I have not read this book yet, but will bet it is right on the mark. Alex and I worked together through his learning years (side by side). The environment, business state and people challenges taught us both alot. The successes were many and achievements great. In the end, Alex gets his biggest kick out of watching people develop and grow. Today many of those folks are at a place they could never of imagined. Having work beside, watched and contributed, I am absolutely thrilled to see Alex share his values and approach.Congrats ! my friend. You have made a difference.Don"
4,Nice Product.,"I've had no problems with this product. I will be most likely re-purchasing them. They're clear, vinyl gloves with a small amount of powder. Not too bulky. Nice product. I carry a box to work with me everyday - I work in the medical field. I don't know if I would recommend them for heavy-duty physical labor as I haven't used them for that purpose. I just wish shipping was cheaper."
1,not comfortable,"tear easy cheap bought other dynarex made in malaysia were pretty good, these are made in china just the facts"
3,Good for the price,The small size is still a little big for my hands. I won't buy again. Next time I will probably consider nitrile.
5,Highly recommend,Simply put I was very pleased. I used these for everything from household cleaning tasks to deal with feline messes. I have already bought more of these and will continue to do so.
5,Always dependable,These gloves are a true life saver when it comes to changing dirty diapers (or any diapers) in our nursery. They fit well and don't tear when being put on.
1,WTF,These are not pods!! They are proprietary plastic filters with coffee in them. I've been robbed!
5,A compelling new take on a famous bit of history,"Steven James does a remarkable job of mixing historical fact and fiction to create a novel of political intrigue, loyalty, battle and romance. The story starts with Lady Godiva's famous ride, and follows how it set off a chain of events, big and small, culminating in the Norman invasion of England in 1066.Godiva and the Golden Dragon brings to life several characters: some real, such as Harold of Wessex, his brother Tostig, and of course the Lady Godiva; others fictional but quite believable. The author weaves their intermingled tales in an exciting saga that puts new twists on the story of the end of the Anglo-Saxon reign in England. The recreation of 11th Century politics is compelling as we witness attempts by various factions to fill the throne after the death of King Edward.This novel could make a wonderful movie as well. Reading this book is a must if you've ever been interested in medieval England."
3,Surprisingly Humorous,"This book was ok. I would not read it again, but I did enjoy it. There is very little detail and description about the times, the clothing, the way of living. The reader must fill in the blanks with knowledge gained from other books. The story and the history and the people involved are obviously well researched though. Some of the characters were very annoying and I wanted to jump into the book and slap them silly, especially Hildreth and Tostig. I will not spoil the story by going into much detail, but they grate on ones nerves. The chapter with the Norwegians had me laughing out loud. The author certainly has a sense of humor much to my delight. So suffice to say, what the author lacks in mundane details, he makes up for with humor and intriguing plots. The Lady Godiva is portrayed as a rather spunky, independent woman for the times. All in all, this was not too shabby."
1,amazon mix up,"I ordered this three times and Amazon continues to send me a different item. They obviously have their computer data mixed up and do not verify the website with what they send out. They told me that this would be off line till it was straighted out, but it doesnt appear so. Neither did I get any verification or email from them that they fixed the problem. I had to return them all and would not feel it safe to try ordering it again.I also found belkin tecnical support for belkin products an extremely poor service and had to wait three days to get a return call to service an electrically blown out product.There you go, you decide what you want to do."
4,... based on Krätschmer's opus,As you might expect with Williamson this slim volume comprises a brief history of the Waffen SS 'im Einsatz' basing its minimalist battle accounts around the exploits of the individual Ritterkreuzträger....this chronology is essentially how Krätschmer has ordered his massive Knights Cross holders book. I rate it a useful primer for those getting into the subject and not a bad read at all.
5,Brilliant playing and writing,"Hindemith's writing combines the great contrapuntal sense of Bach with a mastery of modern harmony. These three pieces, with very unusual instrumental combinations, showcase some of his best writing with a fantastic performance from a world class ensemble."
2,Not worth the hassle.,"I bought this drive because of a review on C-Net. The price was right and it seemed to be everything I needed in a faster drive. I was wrong (and so, I might add, was C-Net). I can't beleive all the talk about ""no coasters"". It's just about all I've been able to make with this thing! I had an 8X that I had a few problems with and was able to get it working thanks to Ricoh's tech support. The same can not be said for QPS. They completely ignore messages sent to them. The icing on the cake for me is that CDR-Win doesn't support the drive (won't recognize it). Stick with a better known brand and a better company."
2,"Not Accurate , coaster city.","It tries to do more than it can, the tweaking the factory did causes many of my burns to overwrite, creating useless over burned cd's. Burning data is Ok but be careful creating music compilations.Tried to correct by reducing the speed, but that just defeated the purpose of buying a faster cd writer. Shoulda stuck with my older one."
1,Awful service,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,HAVEN'T GOT IT YET!!,I can't believe you're asking me to write a review on my product...I ordered it exactly 1 month ago and I still haven't received it. One lousy little book. You tell me!
2,Are you kidding me?,"I have to confess that although well educated, I have never been able to embrace poetry. With that as a premise, my daughter had this assigned for summer reading and of course, I ordered though Amazon. Upon arrival I glanced at the works and for a non-believer , I had to admit that Mr. Kooser's works were simple enough to understand and ""feel"". However, $75 for a grouping of less than 80 poems, most of which fill half a page? I just don't get it and probably never will."
4,Delights & Shadows by Ted Kooser,"Deligts & Shadows is a good primer for anyone looking to get a sense and voice of comtempory poetry, Poet Laureate, Ted Kooser. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Kooser's works. I would highly recommend doing busineess with, A Team Books. The book was delivered on time and in better condition than described."
5,Little Everday Things,Ted Kooser looks at the everday things in life and sees something profound. He can teach us all to be more observant of the world around us. To really live is to connect with the world the way that he does. He sparks your own memories and makes you think about your own life in a new way.
5,Poet Lauret of the United States,Ted Kooser has shown why he is our Poet Lauret. The maturity of his reflections and the flawless imagery make this collection a masterpiece. It is a first collection for those trying to understand poetry. It is a must for the collection of those who love poetry.
1,Not a blacklight; just blue LEDs!,"I ordered this product to be able to spot ""accidents"" by our elderly cat, but this isn't a real blacklight. It doesn't fluoresce on anything except reflective white items. It's going back."
4,good movie,"This movie is about a man played by James Coburn, who is determined to find out the origins of the gun that killed his daughter. He tracks its history and finds out it has been all around the United States and has been used for both good and bad reasons. Very interesting twist at the end. Definitely a good movie."
3,A downer with a message,"This is James Coburn's last film. It's an anti-gun movie with a twist near the end. It's relentlessly downbeat, but the violence is relatively restrained, so you don't have to witness much blood and gore. Not exactly a laugh riot here, but it's well-made."
3,Not their best.,"Clusters first outing with neu!'s Michael Rother predictably falls somewhere between the grinding expansive soundscapes of the previous ""Cluster2"" and the more conventionally poppy beat-driven 2nd Harmonia effort ""Deluxe"". I found it a bit of a disappointment after hearing some of the later Cluster stuff (especially ""Zuckerzeit"" - also made with Rother). However there is plenty here to make it a worthwhile purchase - 'Dino' is the best monobeat neu! never recorded. It is also always going to be miles better than Brian Eno."
4,The Ultimate Surrender by Penny Jordan (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:And then he kissed her ... Polly yearned for Marcus Fraser - but, knowing how much he resented her for marrying his younger cousin, she was forced to keep her attraction a secret. When her husband died, and Marcus offered her a home, a job, and himself as a surrogte father to her baby daughter, Polly's desire only strengthened. Then she heard some shocking news: Marcus was already engaged - and his bride-to-be was expecting ..."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing?,"There are some lovely stories here, and while each and every story has something to recommend it I felt that as a whole the stories were too similar to each other. I would have preferred to have had a shorter, less repetitive collection.P.S. I heard the author reading two of these stories before the book was published. They're really nice in the form. If there's an audio version available, you might want to check this out."
1,Disappointing Compared to other opus,"Having been an ardent fan of Holleran's work for over a decade, I pre-ordered this collection of short stories prior to publication. The title of the collection alone- ""The Light Changes in September""- seemed to promise lyrical, intelligent, introspective prose, such as I had relished in The Beauty of Men and Ground Zero, and some stories from Men on Men. Very disappointed with the reality! Most of the stories were trivial, dull, and homocentric. Several of the stories deal with isolation and obsession with anonymous sex. A sad comment on the nature of homosexual expression at the end of a century of awareness and growth!"
5,Great Quality for the Price,This blanket is sooo cute and really matches the bedding well while bringing out the more colorful hues in the set. I couldn't believe the quality for the price. It's very plush and nice and big.
4,"Great sing-along music, even if you don't know Spanish.","A long time ago, a friend of mine told me he was in love with Maria Conchita Alonso. I had no idea who she was--All I knew was that she was some hot multitalented actress and singer. By chance, I came across a tape while rummaging through a shoebox full of cassettes when I was living in the dorms at San Francisco State University several years ago. The cover was stunning bright pink and had this woman on it. Sure 'nuf. . .It was ""Hoy Y Siempre."" I popped it into my Walkman, and kept flipping it over and over until I knew all the words enough to translate them and sing in Spanish. It's about seven years later now and I still listen to it. . .singing loudly and dramatically in my car. . .reminiscing over the heartbreaking ballads and bopping around to that late '80s, early '90s type fun sound. . .thinking about the time I was enjoying my rent-free daze...I've been a fan of hers since. .. she's awesome! You gotta luv it. .!"
4,The auspicious start to an important series,"MDG's series of the complete Hindemith sonatas is one of the most important recording projects the last 20 years, and is as such curiously overlooked. And for anyone interested in sampling this composers vast output of solo sonatas, this is a near-ideal release; the works are all rather early Hindemith, but also Hindemith at his warmest and most immediately appealing. Stylistically, the works are surprisingly varied (at least for belonging to the same opus number), from the spicily dissonant, neo-classical cello sonata to the generally sunny, untroubled viola sonata containing genuinely memorable, almost romantic, melodies.It is possible, I guess, to find competitive, maybe even superior, alternative performances, but no one will be disappointed with these accounts - indeed, the performances are all on a very high level, and the recording is excellent. Definitely recommended."
5,Great Book - Life's Enrichment Guide,"I first read this book in the late 70's and lost my copy in moving. I came upon this copy I ordered from Amazon by surprise. Although I don't believe in coincidence, this book came back into my life just when I needed it most. My husband recently died and I was feeling alone and hopeless when this book poped back into my life. I can once again feel in control of my life. This book reminds me of my own power and how to stay connected to God and all the wonderful things life can have for us if we are able to stay on track."
3,Interesting but brief.,"The book is straightforward written in a slight ""sassy 70's"" lingo. One of the core chapters on the Subconscious David has you commanding your subconscious as your servant with no intentionality of it's own. His description might be valid and even better for this process of instructing the ""little man"". The core practice is the ""secret"" of bringing in the ""Cosmic Forces"". I tried this exercise with and without saying thelines and felt the same physical sensations (not judging just observing). One interesting thing about that practice wasthe mentally saying things while holding your breath. Osho in ""The Book of Secrets"" mentions holding of the breathas the most potent method of focusing one's attention. Maybe David has tuned in on that? The only other ESP book I've read is by Jane Roberts."
3,Unfinished Face,"The hammer is worth what I paid for it, but the faces were not well shaped or finished and required polishing."
3,Not so secretive,"Not bad, but waaaayyyyy too much time spent on the ""modern vampires"" at the end of the show. Psychic Vampires? Really? History did a better job with its' other special on Vlad the Impaler, some of which is included on this DVD."
4,Great!,"What an awesome documentary! It's packed full of stories and really separates the myths from the facts. The interviews are very intriguing and the actors in the reenactments should get awards for their amazing portrayals! I would give the documentary 5 stars if only it had even more content. Yes, yes, it was a good hour and a half long, but I still was wanting more once it ended.Oh, and one question: anyone know who the sexy mysterious silent vampire man was played by? Because I want to tell him that he can bite my neck anytime, hee hee."
3,Vampire Secrets,The film was interesting and gave a board view. The packaging was such that the dvd was not damaged and arrived as scheduled.
2,what secrets?,"I was disappointed in this video. While their showing of the places made famous by vlad the impaler,and bram's stoker's dracula was good,the video needed more. Yes,it can be said that the story of the female countess that bathed in blood was interesting.But,unfortunately,they talked about it over and over again. Some other stories of so called real vampires would have been better. Also,they mention diseases that have some characteristics of vampire lore,but seemed to pass right over that portion of the show. No secrets at all in this and any even casual vampire fan knows all this stuff. If I were you,I'd pass it by unless your a novice to vampires."
5,vampire secrets,This is a very interesting documentary informative as to where the origins of vampires came from. Brand new in the wrapping.
3,Too much extraneous clutter for this beginner,"There's something paradoxical about the idea of an ""Idiot's Guide to Meditation."" Describing the outward forms of meditation is easy but describing the subjective experience is harder, as is actually doing the meditating. There's real discipline involved in developing mental focus through meditation. Somehow, with all the jumping around from one topic to another in this book, that seemed to get lost in the mix.Myabe that's where my problems with this book come from. There is so much information given about so many different methods that the basics get buried. The authors throw in various traditions, terminologies, positions, theories, and a few women's magazine quizzes were thrown in, not to mention frequent ""Bliss Bytes"" and ""From A to Om."" The book seemed scattered and a little too New Agey for my tastes. Personally, I found Lawrence LeShan's classic ""How to Meditate"" to be better grounded, more instructive, and a more helpful guide for this idiot."
4,Very complete,"It is fun, it is complete and it approaches the broad subject of meditation from many many angles. As such it is a very complete overview on the subject. Next step would be a true 'practitioners guide' and this book will certainly get you to that next step since it does provide a good path to finding out your personal preference. Good basic book."
2,Little disappointed after reading,"There are many books on meditation, and I bought this one and Meditation by Sri Chinmoy. Main reason was that all the reviews were excellent. But Chinmoy's book is superior in every aspect. This book is more a dictionary or overview on meditation and technique than useful practitioners manual. Plus it contains misunderstanding of some basic classification of Yoga styles and separating one and the same thing in different groups. To give you easily understandable example if Biologist gave you a list of life forms that goes like: Animals, Plants, Carrots, Bacteria, ... you would question his knowledge."
4,"Okay, I guess...","I'm not sure why I bought this book. After making my way through it, I've come to the conclusion that meditating is as simple as this: sit or lie comfortable, maybe with a candle lit, and empty your mind. That's it! ""How?"" you may whine, like I did, before I read it.. Well, you just.. breathe. And there are techniques to breathing in the book. There is also the yoga Sun Salute pose, and some odds and ends about brainwaves and suchlike. Overall, a very informational book, but it won't get you out there ""Om""-ing unless you (deep down) really want to. It's a nice read, though, and the only one I've read on the subject. Like they say in Program, ""It works if you work it""..."
4,information overload,"Meditation is ""making it simple and clear"". This book has all the information you could possibly ever need or want about meditation. Now, to make all that information... simple and clear."
5,The Help Beyond your Heart,"This was great! It was a great follow up from The Man who loved Clowns. Delrita has been mourning for her parents,her uncle, and her home. Then Aunt Queenie's father tells Delrita that she's like a turtle on the fence post who needs help. Later, Delrita finally finds enough courage to talk to someone. Can you guess who it was? If you have read The Man who loved Clowns, you should read Turtle on a Fence Post. I recommend it to anyone."
2,Station West (the book),"The book is just so, so. I would recommend finding something else to read.However , if you can find the movie starring Dick Powell, then by all means buy/watch it. It is a terrific western with great performances and it's what inspired me to read the book.(Great Movie/Mediocre Book)"
2,The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place,"I'm not sure there was much to like about this book. The writing was dreadfully dull and overly descriptive, not at all realistic to what a 12-year-old narrator would sound like. There was nothing captivating about the plot, and most of the characters, with the possible exception of Jake, were horribly two dimensional. It's bad enough that the story was boring and unappealing, but the fact that it moved slowly with no subplots made it even worse. The characters seem cute and quirky, but turn out to be ridiculously simplistic, reminding me of Juno. It seems overall like the kind of book written to be read and analyzed endlessly and pointlessly in classrooms. I did enjoy the fact that there was a wrap-up at the end, allowing for some quick closure and letting the story come full circle, but it's a little disappointing when the only thing you like is the very end of a book.Rating: 1.5/5"
4,Konigsberg At Her Best,"Margaret Rose Kane has been saved. After a disastrous stay at Camp Telequa, Margaret's beloved Uncles agree she can stay with them for the rest of the summer. Margaret's quirky Uncles Alex and Morris have been living at 19 Schuyler Place for 40 years and during this time they have built three magnificent towers. As Margaret recovers from a Camp Director who attempted to strangle Margaret's spirit, she soon discovers that perhaps her Uncles are just as much in need of saving.Written as a companion to Silent to the Bone this book will remind fans far more of A View from Saturday. Embodied with a delightfully offbeat sense of humor and wonderful artistic and literary references, readers will find much to like in this satisfying tale."
2,Sub-par Konigsburg,"A great children's author, but not a great book, despite a powerful message.First problem: The characters are aggressively unlikeable for the first third, as if daring the reader to endure them. Even if her camp is overly rigid and populated by loathesome girls, Margaret Rose comes across as an obnoxious, arrogant brat. The ""colorful"" squabbling of the uncles also grated on me.Things improve in the middle-sections but the ending--in which previously hateful people suddenly (and inexplicably) become motivated do-gooders--is just bad, expedient fiction.I'd recommend you stick to Konigsburg's many superb books, among which my favorites include Father's Arcane Daughter and Silent to the Bone. And From the Mixed-Up Files, of course, unquestionably a classic."
2,Disappointing,"The main character, Margaret Rose Kane, and the artistic preservation theme were the highlights in this otherwise mediocre book. I was disappointed with the execution of the plot and had to force myself to finish reading the book. I am a teacher and will probably not recommend this book to students seeing as I could hardly finish it."
1,Thumbs Down for Outcasts,"Perhaps I an too old to get it, but I bought this book as a read for my students before putting it in the class library. This book is so boring that school has long since been over here in Florida and seconds from beginning and I have not completed this story. I would not recommend this particular story. But, if you are a fan, then go for it. Just not my cup of tea..."
4,does konigsburg not know about the watts towers?,"I was finding this book so enjoyable until the last part, and wholly agree with the reader from Massachusetts. I think Konigsburg betrayed Margaret Rose in the end.I was also dismayed that despite the similarities between the uncles and the real-life Simon Rodia who created the Watts Towers (in Los Angeles, before the Watts Riots), the author didn't use the wonderful, heroic victory that was achieved there. Outsider artists, tower builders, and immigrants grappling with foreign city regulations, could really appreciate the Watts Towers, and the famous ""stress test"" that proved to the city's engineers that his construction was as strong as it needed to be. It was a ringing confirmation that pursuing your own creative expression deserves its own place in our culture.You can go on a tour of his towers now that they are restored, and learn about his life, and then you will wish that Konigsburg had used more details of his true story in hers."
3,Disappointing,"A good book, but not on the same level with The View From Saturday or Silent to the Bone. The beginning failed to grab my attention, and it stayed fairly slow-paced until near the end. To call the uncles ""delightfully eccentric"" is a tasteful way of saying that, frankly, they're a bit weird. I did warm up to them eventually, but it took a while."
5,AMAZING!,"Where do you start with something like this? This album is perhaps THE SLEEPER of all time for Hard Rock fans. I only happened to come across it after buying their current release...which is HALF the record that Mood Swings is. Amazing songs from start to finish. This record is in a class of its own. This is a BENCHMARK type of release in terms of production quality,lyrical content as well as the AMAZING musicianship. Sizzling guitar with smooth,strong vocals!Here is a record that simply came out during a real down period for melodic hard rock and thus NEVER got the fanfare or praise it TRULY DESERVED. If you like this type of music and are considering this record....PUSH 'ORDER NOW'...IMMEDIATELY!! Thank me later."
2,wasn't as good as I hoped,I bought this clock for my bathroom and maybe the air was too moist. It's a beautiful clock but after a couple of months the minute hand got stuck on the 8 and of course the time was way off. I putzed with it and put it back up and after a few tries it kept good time and that lasted about 7 months. Then a few weeks ago it did it again and I couldn't get the minute hand past the 8. The wierd thing is that if I lay it flat it works fine but if I hang it on the wall it does the same thing. Needless to say it's worthless. I read on another website that there was a similar problem with it as well.
2,Pretty but runs slow,"We purchased this clock a while back and after several months it started to run slow, we changed the battery and it was fine for about 6 weeks it started to run slow again this has been a recuring problem till today when I threw it out. Junk."
5,Wall Clock,"The unit performs as advertised. I purchased this unit to replace an identical unit, so that I did not have to change the wall mount in an RV."
5,RV Replacement clock,This replaces the clocks that come standard in some RVs. I used this to replace one in our Winnebago Adventurer. Thanks to the color it blends with all of their interiors.
2,Love/Hate This Clock,"I bought this stylish clock to go in my motorhome. It looks great, and when it's running correctly I love it! However, it has a bad habit of slowly losing time. When it does this, I fiddle with the AA battery in back and it runs fine for a while. It then begins to lose time again. I replace the battery, it runs fine for a while, and then begins to lose time yet again. If I didn't like the looks of this clock so much, I'd give it the Frisbee treatment out the door!"
2,the mindless hiker,This book has little to do with hiking ang more to do with finding your happy place. Stephen Altschuler sould leave psychotherapy to some one who is good at it. The little check list at the end of each chapter made me fill as if I wasn't aloud to come to my own conclusions. There are much better books on this supject. Jim Littiken
3,Poker Aces holds up,"This is a very large book with excellent photography and well written articles on each player. After reading about a dozen pages, I realized that it really seemed like I was reading a lot of the same stuff. Most players started off doing this or that, then moved to poker. They won a tournament and became interested and became pro.Overall, I gave the book 4 stars. It provides information on many of today's poker superstars that would take a long time to search for ourselves. We get a unique look at the lives of these players and see that they are pretty much like all of us in a lot of ways...and very different.Ron Rose always seemed to be a nice guy and he made this book with members of his family helping him. You can really feel the love and respect he has for all of these players and the poker community. If you have always wanted to know more about some of the famous poker players, this is a great book for you."
2,Just not that interesting,"'Murder Investigation Team' is a spin-off 'The Bill' and begins with solving the murder of Sgt. Boyden. The casting in this show show just didn't work. The 2 female leads are embarrassingly bad - no similarities to Cagney & Lacey. The supporting cast just seemed to go through the motions. It's hard to really put a finger on what was wrong with the ensemble, other than they just didn't work. The stories were gritty, but also heavy-handed and predictable. This is possibly worth a rental if you are bored, have nothing else in your queue, and want to watch an English cop show. However, there are much better shows out there, including 'The Bill.' I'd go with 'George Gently','Dalziel & Pascoe' or 'Lewis' before buying this. I own the DVD's and would love to get rid of them."
3,Noise and Confusion,"This series looked good on the web page, but turned out to be A Dsappointment. Background noise prohibits hearing and understanding anything most of the actors said. Everyone talks at once on top of that. The screenplay seems disjointed and caused me to be confused as to what was going on. We quit watching them after the first 2 or 3. I'm not a person who is critical for the pleasure of it. We've watched a LOT of British Mystery dvds, and have found some difficult to understand, but this series stands out in that regard. Fred Rullmamn"
1,Hazards of internet purchases,"I purchased this itemMurder Investigation Team: Series Onebelieving that it would work on my equipment.Alas no - it works on my laptop but not on the video recorderattached to the Television. The recorder only says ""format notrecognized"" I assume it is intended for the US market - I live in AustraliaIf I had known this I would not have purchased it. It would have been usefulto be told that it would not work in Australia when I put in the delivery address.Is there a solution to my problem? - other than returning the item to Amazon?"
1,MIDI garbage,"Like another customer said- this is not the music used in the films. To call it a ""new age"" version is generous. It is a midi version, like listening to ringtones of this great music. Somebody just typed the musical score into a computer, recorded it to CD, and is trying to pass it off as a soundtrack recording. Stay away!"
5,Old Memories,"I was born, raised, educated, and married in Chicago. My wedding gown came from Marshall Field's bridal shop. I saw every christmas poarade on state street as a child and young adult. It all came alive in this book! Book was received in mint condition and fast service."
4,Brought back Great Memories,"I bought this book to be able to have a collection of photos, facts and trivia from my childhood memories of going Downtown every year with my family to see Santa and all the Decorations. My sister in law was in from California this holiday and we all enjoyed sitting around and talking about our childhood Christmas memories. What fun. It will be a book to bring out every Christmas Season!"
5,Nostalgic,I Love the book..I .sent to others who seem to love as well..it's a great stroll down memory lane and more
4,Christmas in Chicago,"Generally very good nostalgia. More variety in stores would be appreciated. However, I realize information is limited by historically available photography."
3,Christmas (Shopping) in Chicago!,"I used to ride the ""el"" from Berwyn downtown with my Mom for our shopping during the'40's and early '50's. As an adult I worked downtown in the '60's. This book had everything and more than I remembered. Most of the stores are no longer in business, and I moved away and haven't kept up very much since 1970 so it was highly informative for me."
1,Ageing rich kid needs money - writes book - reveals nothing.,"The reader from Sheridan, Wyoming said it all. I was so disappointed; the guy is so superficial and smug and whiny its hard to believe he is 57 years old. Not a whit of meaningful self examination is to be found, just an endless recitation of who I slept with, where I sailed, and what government figure dared to challenge me. He also subjects us to countless reminders of what a good father he is even though the facts contradict him. You learn nothing about Jane and Henry or Jack or John Ford you don't already know other than some superficial facts. Needs editing badly."
2,I wish he hadn't told anyone,"At great length and, at times, in excruciating detail, Peter Fonda shares with us his life. Not just the cool bits, like hanging with the Byrds, inspiring the Beatles and making Easy Rider, but everything, and I mean EVERYTHING! At times I was wondering if even close members of his family would be interested in knowing this much about him. Must admit I found myself skimming over big chunks of this book after a while. Peter Fonda is clearly a talented actor and writer, with a story to tell about growing up in and joining one of America's most famous acting clans, but sometimes less really is more..."
2,A era icon,"Well started out well. However, a little too much step by step detail read more like a diary you would write while smoking pot. I'm not a prude but maybe he burned a little too many brain cells. So he's anti-establishment and rules. However, he's had the advantage of father's legacy or sister's which helped him get out of allot of crap. If i would of pulled knives or guns on the feds I'd still be in jail.He's just anti-establishment which means nothing if you haven't any true motives.Oh yeah, the only movie of his I've seen is easy rider and it's not exactly a cinematic triumph. It was a piece at the time that was highly needed. I mean, timing was excellent as well as the sound track. I love John Kaye!. In summary, if you want to read about a guy who bangs allot of broads (while married) and calls it romance, does allot of drugs and drones about unheard of movie sets this is the book for you."
4,"""You bet.""","Fonda reveals himself in his autobiography to be quite different from his public persona. Rather than the laid back hippie he shows himself to be a gun toting confrontational hedonist in search of emotional and spiritual healing. Because of this soujourn, the book often carefully describes the facts of his personal history and existence as he sees them. Also surprising is Fonda's behavior in accepting sub par acting roles and making commercial endorsements in order to support his (and his family's) extravangant lifestyle. Hippie not, capatalist, yes, is how I would describe him. I did find the book to be a good read and found Fonda's writing style to be both personal and conversational. I think most readers interested in learning about the man will not be disappointed."
3,"Where's the dirt, Peter?","A nicely written book about Fonda's life, although I found it strange that, having dedicated the book to his sister, there is very little about her and how their adult lives crossed. Far, far too much information about his yachts and their voyages. The story of Easy Rider was well told but overall I felt I gained more insight into Fonda from Peter Biskind's book: Easy Riders and Raging Bulls."
4,Excellent Autobiography!,"I have to admit that before reading this book, I knew nothing about Peter Fonda. All I knew was he was Henry's son, Jane's brother, Bridget's father, had starred in and written a counterculture film called ""Easy Rider"" and did drugs in the 1960's. This book showed that he is so much more than that. This is an excellently written memoir that takes us through his life. It's not pretty but it's honest. Yes, it's a story that includes lots of drugs and a fiery temper when it came to authority figures but that's who he was and I commend him for being honest. After reading the book, I came away really liking Peter."
4,I also bought the companion piece...,"I liked the book so much, I checked out the Society of Primitive Technology web site and joined. Great stuff!"
3,Not a how-to book,"This is a series of articles on the philosophy and benefits of practicing primitive skills. It doesn't tell you how to do anything, but it gives you a lot of insight into why you might want to."
2,not worth your money,"I got this book to learn how to survive and live in the wilderness. To be honest other than making a bow which is so complicated and tanning deer hide, I didnt learn anything. It didnt go into any depth on any survival skills. Dont waste your money if you want to learn anything. This book is for people who already have a basic skill.."
3,"Interesting, not accurate","While this tool has a place (mostly for measuring around curved surfaces) it is difficult to be very accurate because the lines marking the distances don't extend all the way to the edge of the tape so you have to guess a bit. It would be more useful, I think, if the story pole feature was only on one edge of the tape so the lines could extend to the other edge."
2,Very Limited Application,"I thought I would really like this tape, but find I hardly ever use it. For general use, a conventional metal tape measure works better and faster, as you can often work one-handed and there are things you simply can't do with the Flatback. The Flatback tape ALWAYS requires two hands to use, and I don't need the write-on capability. The single thing the Flatback does best is measure around curves. In response to the reviewers that wrote about accuracy, for most purposes the absolute accuracy of a tape doesn't matter - what does matter is using the same tape for measuring that you do for, say, cutting. When I need real precision I reach for a steel rule anyway. You can also compare tapes and rules so you know the error margins within which you are working."
3,A little silly and a little sweet...,"To keep it short and sweet; this film is a bit silly and perhaps a little too cute, but it does have excellent production values and great actors. David Kelly and Milo O'Shea are excellent as always. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if it were possible."
1,"Victorian, descriptive and boring",The language is stilted and pompous. The ideas and approach to the subject are quite cliche and sound as if the author was from the times of Victoria and Albert. The book is very descriptive and lurches heavily from the very beginning. There is quite a lot of modern fantasy on weres that is considerably more interesting. Skip this one.
5,Test Strips,"I used this product to test pH, and this test strip was excellent in the results - 100% each time. Allowed me to know the acid level or alkaline levels in my urine. This is also a way to test for High or Low Blood Sugar - without having to poke your finger and draw blood. It is 100% accurate and highly recommended."
4,Product is is worth it!,I purchased this product about a year and half ago before I had my current pillowtop mattress. I used it and thought that it definitely improved my sleep. I now have it on my guest bed. My brother visited a few weeks ago and slept the whole time! He has asked me several times about the memory foam topper and has decided to purchase one for his bed. I think the product is well worth the money!
1,How to Ruin a Perfectly good Mattress,"..I bought one of these in 4"" thickness, because I had hoped it would help with my shoulder problems...It did not fit my bed, it moved around under the sheet, it did not conform to my body enough to notice, and turned a perfectly good mattress into an abomination...I don't know why companies think people are so stupid that they will buy any 'pie-in-the-sky' story about a useless product..this one is worse than a solution in search of a problem...Do yourself a favor..save yourself the money and the aggravation of returning it."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"I purchased the version of this book in its online format. Let me tell you, it's god awful. There are no maps of any kind, and all the information can easily be found in the official guide. In fact, unlike many unofficial guides, which will occasionally have that extra secret that the real writers left out, this guide actually has less! Although it does have information about the final boss, its not enough to make this guide worthwhile. Don't even think of purchasing this book."
3,This was a really CHEESY book,"This strategy guide was good, but is better suited for my non-productive cheese factory than the shelf."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"I bought this book because I wanted to get into the Final Fantasy game series like my friends and I needed help getting started. This book didn't get the job done. It claims to be able to help anyone from beginners to Final Fantasy experts, but their instructions are no use to the novice. Plus it looks really weird too."
4,An OK book,"Most people would disagree with me but this book was OK, it wasn't confusing as the official and the side information is well put together."
4,best purchase i ever made,"this think is a freakin' beast. i knocked off a star because the fence doesn't sit permanently flush to allow a straight 90 degree cut, so you have to make minor adjustments prior to use. this summer when i get tired of constant adjustments, i might just push the fence all the way back and make necessary adjustments with shims for a more permanent solution."
2,Solidly made-Poorly designed.,"Smooth running machine w/ tight fit and feel. Quality components. Dust collection needs improving. No option given for dust bag. Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!) I ended up using a ""Sharpie"" to make some of the angles more visible. Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut. Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle. Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles. Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off. Trigger safety button would be nice. Quality laser would be nice. I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it. I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211. I would not buy this saw again."
3,Okay,The package was not big enough and did not have enough padding; the edges of the coasters were worn upon receipt.
5,Excellent prep to turn an interview into an offer!,"This book helps you deal with how to present yourself in the most favourable light to a prospective employer. With the preparation this book gives you, exude confidence and competence so that employers will want you on their team. It helped me recognize my strengths and positive qualities - but don't tell too many people about it, let's keep it a secret."
3,Okay product...,Purchased this product before I knew specific information. The important part to look for is the concentration of forskolin and not exactly the # of mg. This product is OK but would recommend other products over this one due to the low concentration of forskolin.This particular product only guarantee's 1% but you should look for minimum 10%.I purchased another brand with higher concentration with good results.
3,Series For Hardcore Fans Only,"I purchased this series because I love Dragonball and Dragonball Z. I had read mixed reviews on Dragonball GT so I did not have high hopes and unfortunately I was correct in holding back. This set reminded me of very bad reiterations of stories we have already seen in Dragonball. Many of the adventures are almost the exact same, I felt like they just gave up on writing. Therefore, it was not gripping and seemed very slow and dull to me. On the other hand, seeing Goku transform into SS4 is still pretty cool. I would only recommend this series to a hardcore db fan."
2,Dragonball Down Grade!,"I've already seen the entire series and even though I love DBZ this Next Level is really the lowest in the entire Dragon ball Series.Every character is ether working at a job or just plain boring. The villains are kind of wack. The best scenes are mostly at the end of the series, like when they turns SSJ 4 Gogeta and fight Omega Shenron (By the way,I think the Super 17 saga was way worst than the Garlic JR. saga)But if you still want to watch it and you're a big fan like me, start from the Second Season because the first is really Lame. Just don't expect it to be half as good as Dragonball or Dragonball z."
5,Finally Here and Finally Remastered,"I know the Season isn't out yet but I got some connections and was able to get it.The DVD contains all of the following like the usualy Dragonball Remastered :* 32 Episodes* Remastered* 3 Audio Tracks (English 5.1 Sourround, English Fun Animation, Original Jap)* Special FeaturesThe only thing I found wrong with this DVD is it's in Fullscreen not Widescreen. If your like me and want widescreen or have a LCD HD tv, you'll not be very happy.I still bought this because it has so much stuff and i can deal with the Fulscreen video."
4,Beginning of gt,Dragonball gt started out very slow almost painfullto watch but it starts to get good on the last twoDVDs. I was nice to see the kais still around butpan made gt a little un bareable with all her cryingshe just talks too much. It's sad that no otherz warrior made to super sayian 3 but the seasonis a must have to know the complete story
3,DBZ isn't over yet...,"GT is no where near as bad as some fans are saying. All the characters have basically remained the same, except Piccolo recieves barely any screen time if any really. Disappointing to say the least. The first two disc I admitt don't inspire much interest with unimpressive characters such as Ludd and Lord Don Chi. However, once General Rildo and Dr. Myuu arrive the story picks up the pace and actually gets interesting. There are great battles and Baby is one bad ass villan in himself."
4,Pretty Good,Watched DragonBall/DragonBall Z all the time as a kid and never got to see the new GT episodes. I bought this and it brought back a lot of fond memories from when I was a kid. There is a lot of talking and stretching things out just like in the the shows I remember but there is significantly less action the the Dragonball Z series. It has a pretty good story and a strong recommendation for any fans of the show.
5,"Great quality, and a great show","The quality is pretty solid. Audio and video are both very sharp, not much more to say about that. The marathon feature is present, which is great because if you had to use the ""Play All"" method you would have an extra 20 minutes to watch for intro and outro credits.I don't really know what else to say about the product itself, but the show is great. All in all this season is very slow, GT only just gets going as this season ends."
1,Should not even be called Dragonball,"I hate this series. Things in it go against the original manga, the artwork is different, and throughout the whole thing you will find yourself going huh? and why?! Not only that but it decimates the original ending with a very dumb one that doesn't even make sense (as much as dragonball might be kinda ""out there"" it has always at least had some explanation for things that makes sense). Toriyama did not even write this story, they got greedy for money and wanted to cash in on dragonball. They basically came to him once a week and he would say ""ya whatever, go away"". Just go buy Dragonball now that the season sets are out, and save up for the Dragonball Z Dragonboxes, don't encourage this garbage."
5,great but dumb,there is going to be a dragon ball GT movie double feature but they only made 1 DBGT movie. how dumb is that but still it's great that they are remastering everything. anyway the season is great the lost episodes are kind of boring but the end of the baby saga is great. the super 17 saga is good but a bit short.
2,Am i too old or this just not good?,"I've watched dragon ball and dragon ball Z and loved both. I bought DragonBall GT with the assumption more is better, but after watching quite a few of these episodes, i can't recommend it. I don't think the plot is good. I don't think it was good enough to start a new season, I think it is ridiculous. It's either that or I'm too old. I'm not willing to admit I'm too old, so i'm rating this 2/5 stars."
3,"Love Dragonball, but.....","First off, I love Dragonball Z like many people do, yet Dragonball GT pretty much sucked at the start and got damn good towards the end. My advice to you, the good public, is if you're a collector of Dragonball, get both seasons. But get ready for a frustrating, boring and downright silly first few episodes. The fun begins on season one, at about the third disc I believe, the beginning of the Baby saga and progressively starts getting better. Be warned you're going to hate Pan, apparently she was supposed to be the spunky new character in the Dragonball universe who was supposed to be fearless and indepedent(for a little kid). Yet she comes off as a HUGE brat that grates on your nerves everytime they give her face time. Besides this and a bevy of other similarly stupid and silly characters, this series as a whole is quite enjoyable and gets great towards the end."
2,New otaku (anime loving freaks) need not apply.,"For any dragonball fan or collecter, this series is a must. However, if youre not into anime, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUUT! Saddly enough there are much much MUCH better animes out there then this one so dont ruin the genre for yoursele before you get to the good stuff."
1,G-UNOT,"This cd sucked!!!! i picked it up this weekend and hoping that it would be well worth lisenting to. it had bad beats and you can tell buck wasn't in g-unit at the time. it is sad to see a great lyricist have a horrible cd. Young buck is still nice and talented, eventhough this cd was nasty. Everybody go see Get rich or die tryin because it is HOT!!! If you dont see it i will come to your house and slap the taste out of your mouthPEACE!"
5,A must for your bathroom library. You will smile as you read,"The artwork is wonderful. We found the illustrations of each animal's waste quite entertaining. It would be a great addition to a potty-training regimine, or just for ""poops and squeeks."" For all ages, really."
4,G-UNITTT,And For People Sayin He Ain't In G-Unit No More Because He Don't Got No G-Unit Features Is Wrong Of Course He Is In G-Unit And This Album Is His Old Stuff Back When He Was Wit D-Tay.....It's Unrealeased Stuff....His New Album Comin Out In Early 2006 It Is Gonna Be Called Buck All Yall.....But This Album Is Hard Too.....And If Yall Get This....Make Sure Yall Get Yayo's Too....Thats Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon....And Tha Get Rich Or Die Tryin Soundtrack Too.....Support Tha Unit Mayne
3,Decent,"This album is good, I wouldn't buy it but wouldn't mind listening to it... The best album of this year though is Tha Carter II~!! Yes sir, listened to it and its a lyrical master mind, y'all need to get this album on Dec 6th"
4,"not as good as Cashville, but that should be OBVIOUS.","i love how people sit there and go on and on about how bad of a cd it is because its not new and they say it is..NEWS FLASH... there has been NO promotion whatsoever on this cd... they're not promoting it as a new cd. its a collection of b-sides... i saw that in the best buy add, before i went and bought it.THE CD... isn't that bad. its not as good as Cashville, but it didn't get the attention or production that Cashville did, either. no, the beats aren't that good. he does sound younger, but that's cuz he was.Bottom Line: if you're a big Young Buck fan, pick it up. why not? you'll get some extra tracks to hold you over til he comes out with a real new cd."
3,Insight to how Crabb diverges from Biblical Christianity.,"This book can be eye-opening to many of us who truly are hopeful that Crabb is moving toward a more biblical approach to counseling (and in understanding man and his vertical relationship with God and his horizontal relationship with his fellow man). If you have been impacted by Crabbs' books, this is a must read. It will give you a very discerning look at how Crabb, many times, still sees the world through the eyes of secular psychology. I do believe that a few times the authors were more sarcastic rather than the more loving exhortation for a brother (1 Cor 2:3-9) we're called to in God's Word. However, overall, we need to be warned: Psychology is at war with God's Word and let us be discerning in these last days."
1,Weak guide,"Very little useful information in this guide. Much of the book is page after page of what stat effect something has on an item even though each tier is always the same. They could have put Tier I adds +2, Tier II +5, Tier III +10 to all mining, reaping, etc. It would have taken a paragraph to provide the same information they choose to pack the book with.Looking at each class such as a mage they provide the name of the spell they receive at each level but no explanation of what effect it has."
2,The only complete recording available - unfortunately.,"It is very unfortunate that the only available recording of all of Krenek's quartets is so marred. The performers are obviously struggling with this music; they are often wildly out of tune, and their ensemble rhythms are very sloppy. The producers and editors have not done a great job, either: somehow they completely missed the fact that the first two beats of Quartet no. 6 have been cut off! The music, however, is very strong (especially Quartet no. 7), and does manage to deliver its message despite the drawbacks. If you're really interested in these works, this is the only way to hear them. If you're merely curious, choose something else - this set would be a very bad introduction to a very fine composer."
1,Price is ridiculous,"I checked another site and apparently there are 3 in the package, which makes it a little less extortionate but really, a individual box for a cupcake and you want more than 2 dollars a piece? Who buys these things?"
4,Very well done.,"This is a wonderfully written book full of interesting, and mostly fact-based characters; Geoff who'd rather be back at the Crusades, his loyal friend Roger who is not always the sole of discretion, the gay squire Durand, Bishop Maurice of London who insisted his frequent need for sex was a medical necessity, and the Belleme women who practice witchcraft and fight as knights. This was a fascinating time in British History and Beaufort does an excellent job of using that period as a backdrop to what is essentially a murder mystery. Fans of historical mysteries will enjoy this."
2,Did not live up to the hype...,"I was very disappointed with these binoculars from the moment I took them out of the box. Overall, they felt to me to be much of much less quality than the previous reviews led me to believe. I found them to have a nice and acceptable image when used , but because of the casing I found the binoculars to be very uncomfortable to handle. The strap and case I found to be cheaply made, as well. I also found that the only rubber protection is the green colored casing. The black is hard plastic which I feel will be vulnerable to damage when used. I have since found a much better pair of compact binoculars, the Pentax UCF-R, which I enjoy much better and I feel are much better made. The Alpens have since been re-gifted!"
5,Very helpful for seeing the world through a small dog's eyes,"I really like the author's attitude toward small dogs and the way she explains how they see the world. I found the book helpful for working with the 8-year-old Pomeranian I adopted. He is my first small dog, and before I read this book, I made the (apparently common) mistake of thinking that when he barks at bigger dogs, it's because he thinks he's a big dog. She points out that no, it's actually because he KNOWS how small he is, and that he barks because he's afraid. She also gives advice that was helpful to me about keeping a small dog safe, as well as gentle positive-reinforcement based training advice."
2,Not very detailed,"I have a 4 month old Papillon and I had VERY high hopes for this book. Unfortunately all the information in this book is very basic and will not necessarily work for every dog. The author did a poor job of expanding topics, especially housetraining...very poor. She teaches readers the ""watch me"" but my puppy has no interest in following treats, has no interest in sitting...holding the treat over the dog's nose has not worked once. I just wish this book had more information than it does and frankly I am very surprised it has received such high reviews."
5,Little Dogs,Very good and the information is very helpful for the small breed of dogs and todays new methods of training a small dog
2,Not necessary,I don't really think that the pint-sized dog warranteed a book of its own. I cannot see that the training is any different from the others I have read. It's a fine book and probably ok if you are not going to buy any other. I expected a whole range of issues I hadn't thought of that effect small dogs - there really aren't any!
5,Awesome Insight!,"I've looked all over for a training book specifically for small dogs and Ms. Woods has finally written it! This book is informative, insightful and fun to read. She has a wonderful grasp on issues small dogs have and doesn't make excuses for bad behavior in a small dog. My 2 yorkies and I have started working on the training and it's wonderful (they are 8 and 2 years old)...never too old to learn some good manners. Thanks Ms. Woods!"
4,Good book for small dog owners.,"After owning labs for years, we just added a shih tzu to our family. This is a great book to help us with training her. There are some chapters in it that we aren't using, but the rest of the book is wonderful. Some of the personal stories included are humorous."
3,Great Buy!,Amazing writer and extremely knowledgeable! I've used all the techniques and they work amazingly!This was a great buy for me and my little friend!
3,"Good Book-Maybe for Non-Teacup Varieties, Though","I have been told that for very small dogs-ie tea cup dogs:They should not always even be handled much-ie picked up. (You have to call them and lift them on towels...)They can not be put on a leash-or wear a collar-for the same reasons. (They have very small bones which break easily.)You have to be very careful with diet: as they are so small even a little bit of something bad is terrible.They are extremely hard to train.PS I think this would be a very good book for: regular size poodles; small-medium terriers; and others. But not teacup sized and what are sometimes called ""toy"" at this point."
5,Very Insightful Book!,"I've been researching about small-sized breeds and I've read a number of books about specific breeds. I then bought this book to help to understand about training and just things you should know about little dogs. This is a well written book, with much insight about things you should or should not do, why size matters? It is very detailed! I now have an idea of where to set up crate and play pen, and just important facts to know before buying a pup.I also recommend reading ""The Power of Positive Dog Training"" by Pat Miller, which is more of a psychology book about dogs. It teachs dog behavior and how that differs from human behavior. It is a great guide for positive, clicker training. It even gives a program for people to use week 1 do this, week 2 train that... very helpful advance book."
4,Great companion book to a training class.,"Well written and easy to understand. Very informative. The part on potty training is short but then again if you go search online, you're going to get the same advice. She teaches the 5 basic commands a dog should know and tells you when you can start training them (at 4 months). she even has a few tricks you can teach your pint-size companion. She also tells you when you can start training on the next, or how long you should train them on one. I would say this is a great companion book to a puppy training class. Its at a good price and you can use this book through-out the dogs life (we all need a refresher course), and any other books you get should be from the library."
2,Disappointing,I was hoping this book would give me better insights into training my Morkie puppy. It was a lot shorter book than I thought and although it gave some good information a lot of it is just basic obedience with a few small dog facts and tips thrown in. I suppose it would be good to have but I would not buy it again knowing what I know about it now.
4,Perfect for Little Dog Owners,"I had previously read several books on dog training, but none met my needs as well as this book. I have a bratty one year old Shorkie, and I needed guidance in setting boundaries for a small dog. Little dogs contains useful information and sweet little stories. It's a quick read and well worth your time."
1,Save Your Money & Your Time!,"I bought this DVD in hopes to learn a few good things to teach my Lab. But that's not what happened.What I did get out of watching this dvd was that I should have just signed up at Pet Smart for their dog training class. This didn't have any real life scenarios using an untrained dog. They used trained dogs throughout the entire thing.From what I can tell from other's reviews on these ""Fun To Know"" series, the producer Millennum Interactive, Inc. is just out to put something on a dvd and put a pretty label on it and sell it as ""Professional."" Yep, it's professional all right, professional waste of time in my opinion!"
2,Too high a 'talk' to 'train' ratio,"It only took Pia Silvani and company a couple of days to make this video and it shows. While Pia offers a fair amount of common sense, there is too much talking and too little training to make this your first choice if you are looking to buy. There are simply better, more professional dog training DVD's on the market. While almost all the commands you'd want to know are here, too many of the dogs have already learned the commands or seem too preoccupied or bored to be learning what's being offered. The lack of production value shows up in many little ways. For instance, teaching your dog name recognition, a prerequisite for learning almost everything else, doesn't show up until the middle of the video."
5,Two great hammers in one,"Not quite American quality but is great to have a no bounce brass hammer and a hard rubber hammer on one handle. Great for working on machine equipment,guns,removing bearings from shafts etc."
2,Dark but not to dark,This one I found to be a little to dark for small kids.I dose how ever have a good story line for a more miture audionce.
1,I DONT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK,This is one of the worst poetry books I have ever read. The poetry is so sappy and pathetic. I actually know the author and think he is just like his poetry. This book is brutal.
5,Soooo CUTE!,"I just discovered Susan Branch's stickers/books/stencils/stamps/etc. I ordered this book for next year, and want to get one for my sister. It's so cute, and there are lots of Susan's drawings and watercolored leaves, flowers, and hearts...I can't wait to start using it. Couldn't find this in the bookstores anymore, so I ordered it from Amazon and got it within 3 days."
5,excellent bargain,"i was already familiar with this item, which is why i bought another. i wasn't disappointed at all. fantastic price, excellent condition and super-fast shipping. no qualms at all about this seller."
1,"Dont buy it , waste of money","this book was worthless, I am going to try to return it. I was not at all happy, very outdated information and some info I found to be quite incorrect. :("
1,Just a one more book about soltwater aquarium,"If you are looking for a complete guide, don't pike up this one. I found it good for first time reader, who doesn't know a thing about reef tank, but it doesn't realy help to set up you own."
3,A good general overview of aquarium keeping,"there are better books out there, but if you want a nice book to read on saltwater aquariums in general, then this book is quite okay."
5,Flying Crane Chi Gong,The production is great. A really well done and easy to learn professional tape . I have been doing it every day and I have more energy and my health problems are starting to clear up. I am telling all of my friends and clients
5,A great series,I read the original three when I was thirteen back in the 70's. I had always wanted my boys to read these books but I had lost the first two over the years. I have just found the series again and I'm thrilled to turn my kids on to this great read.
5,i love this book series!!!,"I stopped reading fiction in High School but I think this is one series I could read over and over...It's really creative and I think it makes you think, especially if you read this when you are a youth. Anyway, I also kind of think the Matrix might have stolen some of their ideas from it.. (tripods, and the thought that humans could make machines that have intelligence and ""revolt"" and enslave them...) but maybe these ideas have been floating around for a long time. I recommend this book to everyone and give it five stars!"
4,A Great Science Fiction Book for Kids,"If you enjoy science fiction books, then you should read When The Tripods Came. This must read book is a story about a boy named Laurie living in a world that was recently taken over by giant tripods. These mechanical monsters are quickly destroyed but not before they manage to hypnotize most of the planet's population. The world is taken over; Laurie, his family, and his friend, Andy flee from England where they were living. They go to live with Laurie's stepmom who left to stay with Laurie's grandma and ill grandpa. The small town where they had sought refuge is quickly taken over and they are forced to seek refuge in the mountains. Can they survive in a world conquered by tripods? To find out read the series.If you like science fiction, adventure, and friendship, you have to read this book. This book is only one in a series of four. I enjoyed this book and I think you will too."
5,For any kid who thinks--or needs to,"This is must-read stuff for any pre-teen or young adult. It's gripping science fiction, but it's also much more. The central themes are mind-control and social conformity. We're all taught to obey the laws and our parents. But what if you woke up one day and the laws and our parents were suddenly wrong, as wrong as could be? How do you know it hasn't happened already?In this novel, three young men come to the startling conclusion that life as they have always known it has been twisted around backwards by an alien race. Their fight for liberty resembles every modern fight for liberty, from the American revolution, to World War II, to the Civil Rights Movement. But don't get smug. The book's ending is perhaps the most chilling bit of all."
4,a book for both genders,"I found this book in junior high, as a 13 year old girl I was still faschinated by the characters. I am disturbed by this being labeled as a ""boys"" book. I think that the characters, while male, still hold a universal appeal. Anyone male or female can relate to the adventures of the book. I loved it in junior high and I still love it over 20 years later. I have three children that I plan to introduce the book to and one of them is a girl. I know they will ALL love it."
5,Great trilogy,"The White Mountains, City of Gold and Lead, and Pool of Fire are absolutely amazing. The plot is interesting and exciting, and the characters well developed. When the Tripods Came was disappointing (I think it was written last, and takes place first--usually a bad idea), but the others are more than good enough to make up for it."
3,Weird Futuristic Book,"The book is about futuristic earth that is ruled by giantmetal monsters,called Tripods.these metal monsters take youngmen when they reach a certain age and cap them with a metal plate that controls their minds.the book also goes on to tell about the journey of three young men,and the sights and people they encounter on their journeysouth to a place they know as the White Mountains.Where theyhope to escape the giant metal Tripods,and the capping of theirheads with the metal plates that would control their minds."
1,Whats Happening????,"White Mountains is the story of a boy and his cousin's journey to the White Mountains. They want to escape the tripods that will take over their mind. Along the way the cousin's find a young boy (Bean-Pole) and see castles, vineyards and much more.I personally didn't like this book because more than half the time I had no idea what was going on, I think it was badly written and hard to understand. *"
4,When the Tripods Came/the White Mountains/the City of Gold a,"I read the book when I was 10(20 years ago) and now I found the books at Amazon, so I orderd it and read the books again. I could remember my feelings when I was 10, and I could feel them again while I was readind the books. Very nice science fiction, and very simbolic. The brain controll via tripods can be a symbol to religous fanatism which controll the mind of lots of peoples! Read it and enjoy it."
5,One of the best Kellerman's and thrillers,"What a treat! I love Kellerman books, and he's got a winner here! Lucy Lowell comes to psychologist Alex Kellerman after she is a juror in a serial killer case. The horror brought out by that case caused Lucy to have nightmares about a little girl watching what could be a rape, murder, or burial. She doesn't remember that the little 4-year-old girl is herself until she goes under hypnosis.Alex, in his clever way, grabs cop friend Milo Sturgis and goes behind the scenes and tracks down the details of this case -- which is very real. People start dying all around them, and Alex and Milo realize they are on to something -- and it's not a dream.This is a great Kellerman book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a spooky thriller. Going back into the past can be scary, and Kellerman makes it even more so in this case!"
4,If you are looking for a nice series to get into....,"If u like a series novelist, Mr Kellerman is just what the good doctor ordered. Kellerman paints vivid portraits of suffering and healing like nobody else in the fiction biz!!! He is a clever and witty narrator that is good at detailing ""real life"" accounts.This guy could be called ""The Mailman"" because he delivers. I know, I know it's a cliche but Kellerman is that damn good (sorry HHH)!!! He is very good at describing his characters and keeping the story flowing at a nice pace. Like his wife, he is just an excellent writer, I know I am laying it on kind of thick, but READ him and u will find out for yourself!!!As usual his stories carry an underlying socio-logical message. He writes with the precision of a surgeon and is just great at documenting the human condition that is life. His book's are always enjoyable and I am surprised they aren't turned into movies. That is the way his novels read.Smooth like JD on ice!!!"
4,Jonathan Kellerman,I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman. I love his character Alex Delaware and enjoy reading his novels. They keep you on the edge.
3,"Not as good as ""The Clinic""...","...but still a pretty good read. Very unexpected twist right at the end to what was an extremely psychological story. Recommended book, but not as highly as ""The Clinic""."
4,"Pretty good story,","but not nearly as good as several other Jonathan Kellerman books I have read. This one is interesting as it really gets into some pyschology.Dr. Alex Delaware breaks away from his usual work and takes on a private patient... a young woman, Lucy. She had been on jury duty full of horrible and frightening details and she is now suffering from a very troublesome dream.As Alex works with her he begins to wonder if her dream stems from a childhood memory and he starts to dig deeper. He finds out that Lucy has had a very difficult and sad life.This mystery novel takes us into con-men's games, pay-offs and multi-murders. Plenty of people have things to hide and Alex and Milo uncover them. At one point Alex's life is on the line!Happy reading!"
2,Slightly more exciting than hypnosis!!,"I found this book to be very boring. Not much happens for the first 300 pages or so. If you can wade through that to get to the story, you might be ok. The descriptions are just so overdone about everything. Didn't like it and would not recommend.Some of his other works are ok but this one is dull."
4,Alex Delaware is a great character!,This is the first Alex Delaware novel and it was a very fast and enjoyable read! The idea of the dream haunting Lucy and then the dream was something that actually happened to her years ago was very interesting. I will definitely read more of Kellerman's novels. I hope they are all as good as this one!
3,Self-defense,This story was not nearly as interesting as most of the other books I have read by Kellerman. I usually like his books a lot but this one was dull and did not hold my interest as much as others he has written.
4,Does the end matter?,"I have fallen in love with Alex and his stories so my slightly lower rating means something. I seriously considered 3 but just could not do it. It was the ending. I really disliked it. It seemed that all of a sudden all the characters were tossed into a blender whirling around here and there....then BAM, an ending suddenly materialized. By the final sentence I was exhausted. I still don't quite get it. Oh, well."
5,Death Row explained,"This is death row real. Written from the perspective of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is perhaps America's most outspoken and noteworthy death row inmate, life on Pensylvaina's death row is explained in graphic detail. From the outrageous hassles and hardships of everyday life to the injustice and inhumanity perpetrated by a very UN-just criminal ""justice"" system...Mumia does not hold back. Mumia has suffered alot of unecessary harassment in Pensylvania's prisons due to the publication of this book. We owe it to him (and other on the row) to at least listen to his voice and consider the ""other side of the story""...if only for a moment."
3,The second half is better,"Once Mumia completes his vivid message about how penn's prisons are unconstitutional by nineteenth-century standards and shares reminisences about his life before, the book improves. The interview with Jesse Jackson is priceless."
2,Poor book filled with rants about Penna. Corrections.,"Abu-Jamal's life is vivid and full enough to fill a dozen books, this one is not needed. I have read about his story and heard his voice. I was looking for more personal insight on the thoughts of being on death row, and his personal conviction. This books tells some of the horrors of death row, but makes them strictly a racial issue. Not very personal or well rounded, just an impersonal diatribe."
4,free mumia,....I enjoyed this book I read death blossoms previously...I enjoyed this book very much it made me so angry because I truly feel that he is in jail only for his political beliefs....but one thing I can say is that his spirit is not broken...and that is so beautiful....the main thing this book did was change my views on capital punishment at first I was all for it but those views changed I am now against it....free mumia!!!
5,A good book whether you believe guilt or innocence,"Abu-Jamal tells about prison life from behind bars I personally recommend it whether or not he is guilty. This book touched me in a way that no book has before. Until I read this book I was not sure if I was for or against the death penalty. After reading it, I felt that we are still very barbaric in this modern age of man. I warn you that some parts are graphic but, it will probibly make you look at our sociotey and wonder why such things happen."
4,Developing Your First Expert System,this book is very good for beginig to learn how to build expert systems
1,No brainer expert system,This book is not my moneys worth. I should have rather bought some pet food for my dog with the money I have waisted. I have some previous knowledge of expert system and now after looking this stupid contents...I feel I can truly teach this stupid authors one or two what is Expert System.
5,Perfect for 5-8 year olds!,"Got these for my kids for christmas (ages 5 and 7) and they LOVE them!! They feel like they are really solving the mysteries :-) I think it helps with some logical problem solving skills as well. Probably good for other ages also, but seems perfect for them at this stage."
5,A great video for a Busy town fan,My son loves Busy town and this was the obvious choice for Christmas. The video is of good quality with recent Busy town episodes. DVD arrives well packaged and on time
1,No technical Support,"This may be a good drive, but I'll never find out. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my daughter to use on her Mac G4 laptop. The drive was not recognized by the Apple (i tunes) software and the ""toast"" software that came with the drive scrambled many of her mp3 files. There may be a simple driver or configuration solution, but there was no useful information on this drive on their website (only sales pages and support information for their 16X drives which did not work for the new unit). QPS technical support did not respond to repeated phone messages (coast-to-coast long distance calls -- they do not have an 800 number for support) and the e-mail to their tech and customer support addresses given on the web site bounced. Out of time and patience, I am returning the drive."
4,A great quiet machine,"This little burner was easy to set up. Plug into computer, plug into power convertor plug into a socket. Done. The drive itself is quiet until burning and then isn't too loud.It's complements the PowerMac G4 tower esthetically and if you sit it on top, the tray just clears the handle. It comes with a snazzy case if you want to carry it around with you too.It runs extremely smoothly in OS9 but it lost a star because there is no driver out there right now that supports this model for burning in OS X."
2,"Drive great, but packaging an issue.","The drive works well with my XP operating system and Nero CD burning software. The only major complaint that I have is not in regard to the performance, but rather with the design. The drive is big, most of which is plastic. There is a considerable amount of space wasted to make the drive look nice. The two plugs for the Firewire cable are located in the back of the drive and are very flimsy. This drive is used for more than one computer and so I must exchange the Firewire cables. I broke off one of the plugs within the first week, simply by pulling the Firewire cable out of the drive. The second plug is loose as well and I fear that even with the utmost care, I will eventually pull it out as well, simply by using the drive. Although the drive works great, I would suggest considering a drive from another manufacturer."
3,"Ok, but no Retrospect","I tried this drive and it seemed fine in general, but it won't work with Retrospect backup software. So if you want to do multi-CD backups on MacOS, you need something else. I switched to the QPS 16/10/40 version, and it works fine."
5,Best micro recorder ever!,"I have used the model for more than a year. This is the best micro recorder I have ever owned. The mix of features, battery life, sensitivity, and file portability is optimum. I like the fact that I can complete a recording and immediately plug the unit into the USB port of my PC and upload the sound files. There are no extra software interfaces or applications required. Files play directly into Windows Media player. I have used third party audio editing applications to convert those files to mp3 and other formats with no problems. I highly recommend this recorder."
4,Recorder Review,"Awesome turn-around time. Arrived in perfect condition. Would buy from them again.Pro - I use it to record college lectures etc and it records perfectly.I haven't figured out all of the features but the ones I have are awesome.Connects easily to computers/USB ports.Cons- The battery life doesn't last as long as the recording time. They should say that somewhere. You only need 1 AAA battery, but it lasts less than 10 hours.It's not compatible with Macs (at least I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to).Other than that it's awesome! Highly recommended!Thanks!!"
1,battery life 3 hours or less,i bought on battery life was around two hours. some batteries did not register - as if they were depleted. i checked each battery with volt-ohm meter first to make sure they were good. thinking it was a reject i sent it back to olympus for service - i need one for my job and turn-around at olympus is listed at 10 days so i got another one at a retail store. same exact problem - this is a lemon - i can't speak for olympuses other models - this one only uses one aaa battery - DON'T BUY THIS!!!-pj
3,Possibilities,"The Olympus WS-331M has potential to be a great product. If I was the manufacturer I would simplify the operators manual and also include it in a tutorial on the recorder itself. I also, suggest getting someone like myself, one who wants a quality and easy to use recorder, but who is not even close to being a journeyman tech geek to write the instructions from his or hers simple perspective."
4,Good for what it is intended,"For notes, lectures and other recording this can't be beat. The built in speaker is low quality but still can be heard. I don't use this as a music player so I can't comment on it's capability. I wish there was a way to edit individual recordings such as removing silence or unwanted parts but there is not. You can only delete the entire file."
4,Mac/iTunes compatibility?,"Does anyone know how this product can be used with Mac/iTunes? I purchased the recorder and like the USB feature, but don't see how to convert the files this recorder creates without third-party software, which I will not use. Has anyone been able to add the files the Olympus creates to iTunes so that recordings can be stored/burned, etc. as MP3 or other iTunes compatible file? Many thanks in advance for your thoughts."
4,Great Little Digital Voice Recorder,"Just got the digital recorder a couple of weeks ago and haven't had any complaints about it yet. Compact, light-weight and so portable that it easily fits into your shirt pocket or pants. Really like the fact that you can download files by simply plugging it into any computer USB port without any other software. The playback sound is a little low, but no a major problem. Also like the amount of memory in this little gadget."
4,My Opinion,"2 years ago after much thought and research decided to purchase the Olympus WAS-321M DVR. I liked it so much that I bought the newest model even though the first one still works perfectly. I was surprised to fin that it has been updated in many small and useable ways making for a notably improved machine even though at first glance they look almost identical. If you read ""reviews"" on this item, you will hear some complaints: in general, I have NO complaints about this item, EXCEPT - and it is one that I have never seen mentioned: I really wish it had a MANUAL RECORDING LEVEL CONTROL. WMA/Mp3 Music sounds as good as the source material. I bought rechargeable AAA batteries for this thing from www.all-battery.com which have worked great. In short: I LOVE THIS THING.thanks for stopping byTheThriftstoreMountaineergKd"
2,not what i excpected,I thought this game was going to be good but not to me the graphics are horrible and it is just plain BORING!!!!!!!!!!
4,A must have for the young engineering student.,Logical !!!Concise !!!Excellent concept delivery and use of practical scenarios.A must have for the young Engineering student !!!
4,"Finally, my engineering professor makes a good pick.",Excellent resource. I bought this second hand and not in great shape. Pages were falling out. I went ahead and bought the PDF version from cmosgccc @ rocketmail.com. Well worth the read.
3,"4 stars for Spice 1 -- A Real ""G"" in the rap game for 17+ years","To begin with I meant to give it 4 stars. It has 13 songs, guests are on 2 so you get a lot of Speezy Ace on here. 1 is almost a classic, 4 are ok, and the rest are good. Production is alright but not the best. J Silva did all 13 of the songs. To say it's one of his worst albums of the 15 I have of his and it's still 4 stars (I'd give about 4 or 5 of his albums 5 stars and probably another 6 or 7 would get 4.5 stars)shows how great Spice 1 is plus the fact he's been around for over 15 years. A good album to have for his fans and fans of real G's in the rap game.#2 - 9.5 (about how all that comes out now and gets airplay is fake g's -- I agree 110%)#3 - 8#4 - 8#5 - 7#6 - 7.5 (a message to all the haters)#7 - 8.5 (f/ Yukmouth & C-Bo)#8 - 8.5#9 - 8.5#10 - 9 (f/ Kurupt & Jayo Felony)#11 - 8#12 - 8#13 - 7#14 - 6.5Robert Lee Green Jr. b. Texas moved to Oakland/Hayward, CA -- b. around 1970Check all my reviews"
1,The Truth Doesn't Say Much,"Supposedly a comeback album for the Black Bossalini but The Truth is Spice 1 fell off when he dropped the mediocre ""1990-Sick"" back in the mid 90's. For the past 10 years, every album that he dropped got worse and worse. This current album does nothing but dilute his own legacy as a former innovative lyricist. J Silva produces the whole record and proves he is just a Dr. Dre Aftermath style wannabe. The songs that are actually decent are ones about getting at girls, lol. The intro's beat is the hardest beat on there. Other than that, this is just music by a has been gangsta rapper that's still trying to milk whatever is left of his core fan base.Note: ""Everybody Want To Go To Heaven"" sounds like same beat on San Quinn's ""Put My Mind To It"" from the ""The Rock"" CD. ""The Rock"" came out five months after ""The Truth"".Highlights- The Intro, Pop That Kitty, What Cha Working With."
5,VERY PLEASED,"I found this item very easy to assemble. It took less than a 1/2 an hour to put together. My daughter was a little short for the height, but is quickly growing in to it. She loves the actvity center and can operate all of the different toys. I would highly recommend this activity center. We haven't used it as a walker yet so I can't comment on the stage of this item at this time."
4,surprizingly much better than i expected,"-yes, it does not adjust to hight, and i had to put something under my son's feet when he was too little to reach the bottom, but he loved to bounce and loved the balls that come with it.-the balls can also be put in the legs, which then roll down to the bottom. my son loves to put the balls in all the different holes.-i didn't have any problems with the paint chipping.-my son would be entertained for hours (expessially when he had cherios on the table) giving me time to relax or do chores. this time got less as he grew older and liked to crawl better.-Now my son uses the walker part and loves it. it moves very well on my carpet.-overall, i and my son are very happy with this activity center"
4,Fun for baby-hard to assemble,"My 5 month old has really enjoyed this toy. Her face lights up when she makes the music play. If she gets bored with being one way, she can turn around and play with something different. I wish it had adjustable heights since she is small. I put a pillow under her feet so she can turn around. It was not easy to put together so be patient. It's great that it turns into a walker when ready so it's a great deal for the price."
2,Baby Sit & Step disappointment,I was very disappointed that the Baby Sit & Step was not able to be adjusted to a lower height. I contacted Kolcraft and was instructed to try and lower the seat. It is adjusted to it's lowest height and my 7 month old grandson can still not touch the bottom. We have had to put a pillow in the base in order for him to touch the bottom and stand. I have since researched other activity centers and found them to have adjustable leg height- I would not purchase this product again. I would research the other brands and be more selective. This was a Christmas gift and was a disappointment to all of us. Thank you. Barb Riley
2,sit & step,"I am reallly disappionted in this product I got it for my son. there many things in the product that i dont like, one the height doesn't adjust and when i got it my son was 3 1/2 months and he was a very active baby who always wanted to stand and play. now at 5 months he still only plays with about 3 of the toys on the this product , we would most of the time rather play with what ever else you place on the tray. and when the product first came out the made it sound like it went from and stationary to a sit in walker... when it really is just a walk behind. he enjoys the excesuacer much better then this product"
2,Chokes my baby,I bought this for my 4 1/2 month old baby. He loves the seat. But last night when he was playing he pulled the green mirror part forward and it got caught under his chin. It was choking him. Luckliy I was sitting right next to him and could get him out of the seat quickly. I plan on returning it today and letting the maker know that this happened.
2,Is this sturdy?,"I recieved this as a gift, my baby seems to like it, but I dont feel comfortable leaving her in it. It seems like its not very well made and has what I find to be sharp edges on it for a baby and the paint does chip."
4,Does the trick/a little tricky to assemble,"I bought this activity center for my 5 month old daughter a few days ago. Overall she seems to really like it. it has kept her entertained for up to an hour at a time. I think it has enough things to look at for any baby to be curious about. The only complaints I have is that assembling the cloth part of the seat on the ring is a little difficult, and the AAA batteries had to be wiggled around for the musical part of the toy to work. I read that in someone else's review so Kolcraft may want to check that out. All in all it does the trick to keep her entertained while I get a few things done. My little one likes to stand so this is good for that!"
2,Not that great,"My parents bought this for my daughter for Christmas and one of the plastic pieces on one of the parts broke when we were putting it together. It turned out to not be a problem with the function so she did play in it a few times. The biggest problem was that it couldn't be folded and tucked away anywhere. My daughter also didn't find it very amusing. I don't think there were enough toys for her to play with. We ended up returning it and we bought the exersaucer mega by Evenflo. She absolutely loves it and I love it because it can be folded up and put away. It's also really easy to travel with. The Evenflo one also has interchangable toys you can purchase seperately. Go for the cheaper in price model by Evenflo! It's a life saver. Cheaper,more exciting and able to be folded up. I just wouldn't recommend the baby sit & step."
2,difficult to assemble,"It's very difficult to assemble, especially the seat portion. It uses AAA batteries, which are less common than AA ones.One of my kids likes it, but the other one doesn't."
4,Keeps my baby entertained,"I bought this from Amazon.com for my baby when he was 4 months old. It arrived with many missing parts. I wrote to Amazon but I was directd to contact the manufacturer, Kolcraft instead. I Fortunatley, Kolcraft was nice enough to send me the missing parts. Because I am stationed overseas (military), it took about a month before we had all the parts to assemble the activity center. My baby is now 6 months old. At first, my baby didn't like to be in it, but after several weeks, he finally took to it and now it keeps him entertained for at least half an hour, sometimes even up to an hour which gives me the time to work on my computer, clean the house, do laundry or other household chores. I haven't used it as a walker so I can't comment on that. I am satisfied with this product so far and would recommend it to any parent."
2,Beware--Toy fell on top of child,"We liked this when our son was younger with the base attached. However, my son is 10 months old now. We have had the bottom off so he can use it to help him learn to walk. This morning he was seated in it and reached forward. The whole thing fell on top of him. He was very upset as were my husband and I. Just a warning. My husband almost chucked the whole thing in our pool. I will use it if we have another baby with the base attached when he/she is young, but not once he/she is past 8 or so months."
3,misleading...,"The toys are great, but the baby does not stand like a traditional exersaucer. The baby sits (feet are not supposed to touch ground) and spins around using arms."
4,Rumble Roses - Models Gone Wild!,"Yeah, It's like a supermodel reality gone bad! The only reason I didn't give it a five is because it's on my archaic PS2.Descendents of the Pantheons: A Graphic NovelThe Sweet Smell of ASH in the Morning: The Pocket Edition"
4,great game,"Rumble Roses is a great game for wrestler fans around. Better yet, the game features all women wrestling."
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"I don't play wrestling games much, but I played this because of the concept and the price. (I got it new for $5.00.) Female wrestlers who are half naked? It almost can't go wrong.The game itself is nice to look at, and the controls are easy to master. The instruction booklet could have used more work, though, and the game is a little too easy at times. The mud matches are nothing to get excited about, either, and the music was bad. The characters' backstories? Not worth the napkin they were written on. It was fun, however, tossing people around and doing humilation moves. Putting an opponent in a compromising position is always fun, with the added bonus that both are ladies.If you can get this game at a deep discount and are mildly interested, it is worth it. I would never pay full price, though."
4,Every rose has thorns.,"I've become increasingly dissapointed with the WWE wrestling games, while the quality of their games is great the way they treat their female characters is shameful. So now i've found a wonderful alternative, the gameplay is strong, the girls are gorgeous and it is fun to play.PROS.1. The ablity to gradually switch your character from good to bad and viceversa creating different personas.2. great graphics3. great gameplay Cons.1.The story mode is a lot of fun but after each match there should be a save point, for those of us who dont have the time to sit for an hour, I dont want to HAVE to skip the story because im pressed for time.2. No tag team action?? get out!3. To execute a reversal depends more on luck than skill.Overall RR is an excelent alternative to testorone fueled wrestling games, plenty of eye candy and fun to play. EP"
3,Rumble Roses,"Ok so i guess ill say it.I purchased rumble roses for the many ""Assets""it offers.I mean who actually bought this game for the wrestling.Ive played this game and on several occasions had to replace a controller.Its funny you beat the crap out of your opponent and they all of a sudden pull a hulkamania and get all their energy back and in just a few moves your pinned.I mean really!It cant be stressed enough this game is for the really lonely!I think konami had a good product on thare hands but they didnt take the time.It just proves what they were making it for.Konami is full of very lonely people and thats ok.If you can handle stress play it. for all the Bad dialouge and cheatin this game does go ahead.Ohh and its cheap!"
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this game when it was first released, and I really felt like I was wasting my money.First of all, the voice acting is so horribly corny that I couldn't play through the game without cringing. The game tries very hard to be sexy, with the girls in skimpy outfits and the ""humiliation"" moves, but it's just so hackneyed that it's not. The animation during cutscenes is decent, but during play, it's a little substandard. The matches weren't very challenging, so the gameplay became boring quite quickly.This game might be fun to play once in a while, but it definitely wasn't worth buying new."
5,"Beautiful music, thought-provoking lyrics","This CD is billed as part of the ""songs for peace project."" The lyrics of all songs come from mystic poetry representing various belief-systems from around the world---though heavily from the Middle East. The music, which was ""worked out"" by the male (David) and female (Nance) vocalists, can well be described as soulful, beautiful vocal duets, with non-obtrusive instrumental accompaniment. I found the songs to promote a feeling of meditative serenity---a very fitting mood in which to contemplate the thought-provoking, and often inspiring, lyrics."
1,Don't buy if you are a fan of David Wilcox !!!,"I saw David in concert a couple of month's ago, and was hooked.I love his songs, voice, guitar, timing and the emotion he can put into his voice. I am neither personally religious or spiritual, but I can appreciate music that is, and I thought that David's style would meld beautifully with the songs. Unfortunately this album is more of a vehicle for David's wifes' voice than his, and so I was sorely disappointed. David is very much the background singer. Nancy's voice is O.K. but not anything special and not what I wanted to listen too. Very disappointing CD.So, if you want to hear David Wilcox sing, pick a different CD."
1,Way below the mark...,"I have every David Wilcox CD, and this is the only disappointment out of all of them, besides a few songs on ""underneath"". This isn't really my thing. I listened to it once, and that was it."
1,Picture is not what is shipped,"I get so tired of companies that take pictures that do not match the description or flat out are misleading such as the photo for this product. I shows two cans of aerosol. You receive only one. Rip off? You tell me. I think so. If I have to dig and look for the fine print to desipher the actual product viruses the picture I figure they are not straight forward and honest with customers. I did not read anything that suggested only one can would be shipped. If the photo shows two cans and the cans are a special scent, that is what I expect. No more orders from me. I would suggest using another company. I did not try to return the item as the value is so low it is not worth the time or cost. I guess this is what they expect. Buy it and eat the cost. Run"
1,Depressing,Obviously so controlled. Not real at all and it is sad how the shows producers try so hard to make the stars (?) feel like crap about themselves. Its a serious phsycological problem and a one hour show bullying them into cleaning up a lifetime of collections is wrong.
4,Cute welcome sign,"A welcome sign for inside the house for our son's first birthday party. It was not expensive so the quality is about what you'd expect. Thin material, much lighter than ""cardboard"" (i.e. packing box) but heavier than card stock - roughly about the thickness of a poster board (not the styrofoam backed kind).It is a tri-fold sign, and no amount of pre-unfolding removed the folds. I had to apply multiple pieces of tape in different areas to make it lie flat, but I expected that. I purchased it with the intention of using it once and then maybe keeping it up for a few days, and then tossing it.If you used it in a classroom or flat-door setting, you'd want it to be somewhere where it wouldn't be touched all the time, I don't think it could stand up to much wear and tear. That said, brightly colored, accurately sized, as described, good item."
5,:),"we got it for my sisters babyshower, and she hung it up by her sons door as a measuring chart:) good job cat in the hat."
5,It was great! Just what I wanted.,It was perfect! Just what I needed. We will use it on Dr. Seuss' birthday at preschool. It will be great.
1,1 or 2 in 1 order?,Just wonderinf I would like 2 of them. Are they doublesided? and do they come in a package of 2?ThanksLiza A
2,Overpriced and under-researched,"Very nice, trendy little coffee-table type book, with pretty pictures and a small amount of general information you could easily find just about anywhere. Not a book for the serious researcher in spite of the glowing reviews obviously submitted by friends and relatives. It would make a nice gift for a favorite aunt or grandmother or a pal met at the spa. Do not purchase, however, if you are trying to find serious and detailed information concerning the history, lore and making of rare or even classic incense blends or you will be sorely disappointed."
3,Broad brush overview,This book is very nicely written and easy to read but it doesn't go into any real depth about incense. If you're interested in an overview of the history and traditions of Incense it's worth reading.
3,My daughter loves this video,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves Mary Kate and Ashley's Party series. My favorite is the campout video. As for the ballet video, my young daughter has learned all of the words to Satin Shoes and has been showing me how a ballerina positions her feet. I think that it is important for everyone involved in the making of these videos that the twins are role models for our little girls."
2,Three videos,"I ordered this thinking that it was all of Mary-Kate and Ashley's videos. Instead of getting them all, I got three, I guess it is a good deal. I got the seaworld adventure, volcano mystery, and hotel who-done-it. My guess is that they randomly chose three videos and rap them up together, or just give the three I mentioned. I hope that I helped you out, because when I came here, I was kind of disappointed that no one had written a review."
2,three videos,"I ordered this and I thought that I wuld be getting all of the videos, how stupid could I be? Well, it is three videos, I do not know if they are randow, or what but the ones I got were Seaworld adventure, space camp mission, and the volcano mystery. I thought I might say a few words to try to help people out. since there is no description. Did I help you?"
3,You're Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley's Chrismas Party,"I thought Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Christmas video was okay. It was nothing like how a real party would be, but it did have some really interesting footage. First of all, it shows Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen on their family ski trip in Vail, Colorado. It also sends a good message to younger viewers about how Christmas is a time for sharing and giving, not just taking and being mean. I would recomend this Olsen video to any Olsen fan, and anyone who has a child, or is a child at the age of ten and under. Hope this helps!"
5,Great first video!,"This is their first music videos. Videos like ""No One Tells The President What To Do,"" ""Peanut Butter,"" etc. If you are a die-hard fan of the Olsen twins, this is a must-see."
4,Another Olen Video with no story line (barely!),"This Olsen video is about how they waited to the last minuite to plan the birthday party. They need ideas to plan the party, so they think of an idea then sing a song about it. I watched it so much!! They go to six flags and sing a really cool song, an they have a pool party, that song is very fun!!! This is a pretty good Olsen video, but the camping one is better! They learned how to act, dance and sing better in that one! They didn't open presants, that made me mad, that's the best part of a birthday!!!"
5,The greatest Adventure video !,"The Trenchcoat twins has to go to Hawaii to solve this mystery. I think this is the best Adventure video. It also has the great song ""Why can't we live in a hotel all the time"". Believe me, this one is really worth the money. (not that the other Adventure videos aren't)"
4,Not Good Singing!,"Ok, I know that in this video Mary-Kare and Ashley are only working pragress, but the singing is the WORST! The video is very cute, but it also gets borring very fast. If you like Mary-Kate and Ashley's early stuff then get this video, but if you don't then SAVE YOUR MONY!"
1,Too Childish and over-exaggerated!,"This is the worst Adventure of the Olsens. The grown-ups in this video are REALLY annoying and you almost get a head-ache by watching them. I'd recommend The Case of Thorn Mansion instead, which doesn't have any annoying grown-ups, and is a plain cute video with the greatest songs."
4,VERY cute,"this video is sooo cute if you don't like the videos where they sing then don't go for this but if you do then this is the best offer. the twins are adorable and they sing songs such as ""i am the cute one "" and ""brother for sale"". my favorite song is ""identical twins"" because they look so sweet. if you love watching the twins when they are young then this video is a definate MUST!"
3,O.K Not much of a mystery but VERY educatinal. Would reccomend to 3rd-4th grade Science teachers. Tells ALOT about volcanoes!,"Its O.K. I just got through renting it from the library and waching it. Wouldnt wach it again. I am VERY glad I didnt BUY it. If I did, i'd give it to Mrs.Luc, my 4th grade science teacher (Im going to be in 5th grade). Dont buy it. Its the worst movie the Olsen twins have EVER done. Trust me, Im a HUGE Olsen fan. Dont think because this movie is not very interesting the other Olsen movies are bad cause theyre THE BEST. I wouldnt want to be one of those idiotic jerks who dont like the Olsen twins. This one's not much of a mystery; more of all about volcanoes."
5,still great,i love it it's my favorite you're invited movie you can picture them on full house wich aired 1986-1996 when this was made so it always brings a tear to my eye
4,The perfect book for the beginner,"It is a really good reference work.It's quite complete covering all the fighting vehicles currently in service.However I think that the description of each vehicles are somewhat sketchy.The author should have stuck to one type of description always listing and explaining the same characteristic.Instead he talks about something on one entry and misses the same kind of info on the next.It is really annoying.There are also big errors.Many words are printed to or three times and the orthograph of certain entries are incorrect.A very good book, not of paramount interest to the expert but very interesting for the military enthusiast."
3,"Excellent Resource, However not as advertised!","Just recently picked up the 2002 edition of this book (current edition as above). Great reference book for anyone interested in modern AFV's.However, there is a major omission, as the book states it contains Self Propelled Anti-Aircraft systems, but they are not included in the book. An obvious error that should be corrected either by including them in a future edition, or removing mention of them being included on the back cover (2000 edition also has this same error).Only reason for the 3 star rating. Otherwise the book is well worth the price, and has a mountain of detailed info, statistics, color photos & diagrams on most all of the AFV's being used around the world today."
4,Review For Jane's Recognition Guide-2nd Edition,"In general, this is a good book since it included some new such as armoured vehicles from countries such as Iran, Croatia, and Singapore, in addition to items from the first edition. The only drawback was the section on Self Propelled Air Defense System such as Self Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns and Self Propelled Land Based Air Defense System was deleted."
2,Previous Edition was better.,I would get the more current editon of this book or the edition before this one.
4,"Tanks, APC's and other Armored Things","This paperback edition of the Jane's series is a major feat. Jane's takes all of the available information and some errors which are unforgiveable, whips them together with standard stock photos and presto, makes a WORKABLE basic guide to modern armor. There are ommissions and very poor editorial control all over the place. I wish that Jane's would have spent more time with the book. Many if not all of the pictures are the same in Tanks of The World, by David Miller. I was surprised by the number of wheeled armored vehicles in this book. Not great, but good."
5,A great little reference manual.,"While not the most detailed or in depth manual, this little book is great for quick reference for identification of most modern combat vehicles and tanks.Visual recognition for each tank or combat unit is easy with full color images of each tank/vehicle.The stats for each tank or vehicle are well done, the history is brief and to the point without extensive background information that some may find tedious.I highly recommend this ""pocket-sized"" book for those just wanting a tank/military vehicle companion guide they can grab fast off the shelf and find most any modern vehicle they are looking for."
4,An Un Avoidable Reference,"This book is absololutley massive it briefly describes the development specifications, status and manufacturer of every combat vehicle in service today from tank to armored personel carrier's to scout cars etc. yet the problem is that the pictures are in black and white and as i said it only describes BRIEFLY the combat vhiecle. Over all it is worth the money RECOMMENDED."
4,Complete guide,"If you need a first-view recognition guide, or a few words identification tank, here you have the definitive pocket guide."
5,Simplify your scripture study,"I love reading the Book of Mormon this way. There are none of my personal markings in this book and with the reformatted text, it is a little like reading it the first time. I find that the story flows well. I like seeing the poetry written/formatted as poetry. I love the subtitles. Very, very helpful to the reader. And, of course, the Book of Mormon is a wonderful and important book. It blesses my life."
2,"A lot of filler, unfortunately.","The so-called ""rap"" either consists of imitation frat-boy yelling or imitation DJ patter. Not surprising since two of the members are from Monterrey's ritzy ""fresa"" district. Their pouty ""rebel"" image (they threw in cuss words liberally) was marketed well enough for them to get to pose for photos in some of the Mexican teenybopper mags, right between the makeup tips and the advice column about boyfriends. A few hits resulted, but the rest of the album just meanders along with boring filler. Polygram Records definitely made its buck, anyway."
5,El Machete Controlando,"I am from Pharr,Tx I am the #1 fan of Control Machete I recomend both albums because are Excelent if you like good music, this Movimiento Rapero cause us to start a clika called MACHETES our clika is controling South Texas and Reynosa Tamps. Mexico If you want join us. Y Chinge sumadre el que no le guste me comprendes mendes la artilleria pesada controlando"
1,Control Machete No Tiene Talento,"Este album es menos que basura. Las letras de las canciones no tienen sentido y la música suena horrible. Estos pseudo raperos no tienen idea de lo que es verdadero rap. Son unos pobres diablos imitadores de Cypress Hill, que no tienen nada importante que decir. No pierdas tu tiempo, ni mucho menos tu dinero, en este album que no vale ni un centavo."
4,Solano County Guide Reciew,"The Thomas Guide for Solano County is a good source book for finding your way in and around the towns of Solano County and some of the nearby areas. It includes even the smallest of side streets. This book is very easy to use from the front cover to the Points of Interests in the back. My only true beef with this book is that some of the countrysides did not get included in the detailed maps section. Granted most of the area left out was farmland and pastures, but if that is your thing, this book falls a little short. If you are looking for a guide/map book to get you in and around the cities in Solano County, then this is a great resource for you."
1,surprisingly terrible scene,"Turning the pages with my 2 year old son, we were enjoying the story and illustrations until we found a fork appearing to be piercing the live mouse. My son immediately asked for the book to be done. I guess I'd better start censoring the books I read him! I was really disappointed. I later showed my husband (this is Mark's wife), and he was sickened by the pitifulness as well; it appears to be a pretty nasty scene."
4,A fun take on an old theme,"Frank and Devin Asch give new meaning to the term ""Cat and mouse"" in the delightful _Mr. Maxwell's Mouse_. The punctilious Mr. Maxwell visits his regular restaurant the Paw and Claw to celebrate a promotion. As a special treat, he asks for a fresh mouse for his lunch.The exchange between diner and dinner is mildly humorous, as each seeking to gain something from the other (the cat his meal, the mouse his escape) under the veneer of polite restaurant conversation. The story itself is interesting and charming in its revisiting of an old theme, the artwork reminiscent of the 1920's. A fun book for younger children or those just entering school."
4,Great follow-up,"I played brain age 1 constantly (I still can't say BLUE good enough though). Brain age 2 is a really good sequel. Just as much fun as the 1st one, and you never have to say the word BLUE."
2,Too Many Information Screens,"Navigating through the information screens every time you want to play a game (even in quick play mode!!) is monotonous. The Sudoku games are fun and challenging, but can be improved upon by tapping the numbers into the boxes instead of having to write them. Sometimes the software doesn't recognize your writing, which will cause you to lose points."
3,Brain Age 2 is much more challenging,"Brain Age 2 is much harder than 1. It's challenging so if you're up for a good one, start with Brain age 2. Brain Age 1 seems like it has more math problems.I tinker between the two every now and then. My favorite of Brain Age 2 is the keyboard. I hate the clock!"
5,not an ounce of bad.,i likes it. if i can get it back from mom. very addicting. get one for your mom and pops.
3,Brain Age 2 game,I haven't played it that much to give a good review but so far everything is fine. The game came with good directions and was shipped quickly and without any problems.
1,Crappy Game,"This game is very tedious. You have to go through the explaination each time you enter a game. My biggest complaint is the Quick Soduku option which only has ONE game. They are the exact same numbers each time you play. This is not true for the main gameplay, but it is a serious flaw."
3,Interesting,"The idea is interesting. I bought this for a gift. I don't have a DS, so I cannot try it out myself. (I""m writing this to get Amazon off my back about submitting a review. Damn, they're getting obnoxious!)"
1,Hard,Ummm Why am I hurting myself trying to play a game. For me this was very complicated. I don't want to think when I don't have to! Not what I thought it would be.
4,Addicting Brain Action,"Not a terribly deep game and I'm not sure how much the little puzzles really ""train"" your brain. Are you supposed to be more alert? A better problem solver? The scientific function of the game is never really explained. But, if you are into problem solving and puzzle games you will get hooked into this. Tons of replayability for a little price = nice!"
3,Its Okay,"The ""tests"" are fun to take and can be frustrating at times, but there is a sense of accomplishment when you see the improvement from beginnig till now. The good news I can still score better than my grandkids. First time I took my brain age test I was 82, I'm now 52! Pratice does help. Helps to follow instuctions (my wife loves that). Could do with a little less or different ""conversation"" from the doctor though.He ""says"" the same thing every time!"
3,"Not as good as it appears to be, but good enough.","This game is a good time killer, but not a whole lot of fun, if you play it by yourself is boring, but If you have someone else do it you can get competative about getting a higher score.all and all it's a good product."
5,My brain hurts from thinking. /(>_<)\,I loved the first Brain Age but Brain Age2 got a wee bit harder in the types of exams they test you with. I get stuck on some of them and take awhile to think up the answer. I LOVE the Piano one where you press the piano keys according to the chart on the side. It's addicting like the last one and it'll keep your mind thinking. If your a Work-Out buff dont forget to grab yourself a DS cuz there's a part of your Body that is important to give a workout to and that your Brain. Brain Age and Brain Age2 can definitely help you train your brain. :D
4,Brain Age,"This is a fun way to see if you can ""improve"" the age of your brain, but there really isn't a lot to it. I was hoping for more games and more levels. It is a bit disappointing."
4,Full of challenges,Great! Grabs your attention and desire to solve everything that appears!! Definetely reccomend for adults and kids!!
4,Great for thinking skills!,"The whole family is playing the many games on Brain age. It helps the kids learn to make change, improves their math and listening skills. Sudoku is on here, too. The more they play it the more game choices they have."
2,LAME!,"When I first got my DS this game was part of the present. I was really excited because I wanted a DS more for NYT crosswords and the like so I thought this would be perfect. Ugh! Not so. This game is pretty boring. There aren't that many ""tests"" and you can only record your scores once a day! You CAN play the tests over again to ""train"" but puzzles like word jumble (that's not the exact name of the test) stay the same until the next day so there is no real challenge.There is a sudoku game in addition to all of the fake brain tests but that can only hold me for so long. I'm the kind of person that likes addictive games. The kind of games that when you close your eyes to go to sleep you are still playing it in your head. Brain Age 2 can only really be played 15 mins tops a day.Since I bought other games Brain Age has been sitting in the corner collecting dust. Good thing I didn't pay for it."
4,SCISSORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAARGH!!!!!,"Ok, both Brain Age games are great. I received them as gifts recently and I am enjoying them a lot. The sudoku is great and it has actually sparked my interest in those puzzles. I recommend this title, but my only beef with it is that the voice recognition leaves a little to be desired. There is a rock paper scissors game that requires you to speak into the microphone on the DS, and for some reason, it has extreme difficulty recognizing the word ""scissors"" Everytime I have this daily training exercise it causes my brain age to decrease dramatically, not because I have trouble with the exercise, but because it ends up taking the game 10 minutes to understand that I am saying ""SCISSORS"". Because of this, it has determined that my brain is 80-90 years old.Fun overall, but ...SCISSORS! SCISSORS!!! SCISSORRRRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!"
4,Great game,"I bought this game as a gift for my 12 year old cousin and she loves it, and both of her parents get enjoyment out of it as well. Nice change from none educational games"
5,Great Game for Any Age,"I think this game is a great edition to any DS owners collection. It challenges you to think about small things most would take for granted after middle school. The only problem is if you are done your training for the day, you can't keep playing. What a bummer, but that's what it says is ""daily training"" so it's not like they don't let you know. If you like sudoku, there is a game that you get that you can unlock and play anytime...so that is a nice little bonus."
4,decent,"decent game, has an extra thing to play that some people do not know about, i would suggest looking up thie game online to find it"
4,Brain Age 2,This was given as a gift. The recipient was pleased and has used Brain Age 1. Overall satisfied. Delivery was as stated and condition was excellent. It came by US Mail.
4,Brain Age 2,Pretty fun game if you enjoy challenging your mind. Whether or not it has improved my brain function like advertised is unclear. Mostly plays the way it is supposed to although the rules for some of the games could have been made clearer.
4,"Sweet Not Sour, like those nasty pickled plums!","I love this game! I'm 29 yrs ol and I just bought my first ever handheld gaming device, the DS Lite. And when I did, I ordered this game to start with. It's pretty much the only game I play, even after buying several others after I received my DS Lite & BA2 in the mail. I enjoy not only the brain game challenges but also the simplicity of the game. Anyone can pick up this game, put it in their DS and get started and actually ""get it"" right away. It's so easy and so fun!There is some silliness to it that could have been eliminated, but honestly the silliness is part of the appeal."
4,My first DS game,"My sister gave this game to me along with a DS platform for Christmas and I have been hooked ever since. The daily training if super fun and I like the whole stamp reward system, where with increasing amount of stamps collected, more training modes are unlocked. The only complaint I have about this is that there are too few training modes! Also, I agree with a previous reviewer that there can be a little too much of Dr. K giving repetitive advice and tips, which can become inane after a while.Otherwise, this game is super enjoyable and keeps my brain alert, even if only for 5 minutes a day. And, since I'm also a Sudoku addict, this is perfect for me. Again, the only complaint about this aspect is that I'm coming close to solving all the Sudoku puzzles; so I'm quickly running out of Sudoku to play!"
4,Good daily training!,Good way to train your brain. Actually use your brain instead of a computer. Simple but must view and process the questions progressively quickly.
4,What can you say of a sequel?,"I have owned the first in this series since it came out. I was looking forward to the release of this sequel.It has more of the same brain trainings but with a change in some of the methods (games) that complements the original.For a second purchase, you will find yourself switching back and forth for variety. For an initial purchase, you cannot go wrong with getting Brain Age or Brain Age(2).Regardless, there are suduko puzzles on each.Very enjoyable."
5,My husbands review,"I bought this for my husband for christmas and I must say he isnt much on video games, but he loves this one. The first day the game said his brain age was 84....He's been trying to bring that number down. This game is addictive, and alot of fun I must say."
3,It's ok...,"I like that I can use this game every day for a few minutes, and that I can use it while waiting in a waiting room and the like. It passes the time a bit. But I have to say that I'm not all that into it or excited about it, it's ok."
4,Enjoyable and improving your brain,"I wanted to find this game out so i decide to buy my own Nintendo DSi XL (i bought an 25th Especial Edition). I love to exercise my brain and Brain Age 2, it`s the first one. If you`re an adult (me 43 Years Old) you`ll find a lot of fun playing this game. I prefer Sudoku and math chalange, beside you have a Daily Practice which really help to improve your skills."
5,Hard But Fun,"This was requested by my wife. She is having a great time with the challenge. Her only complaint was that the time required to figure out exactly how she was supposed to write down her answers counted in her first score. But, since that first effort, she's been having a blast, so she still wanted to give 5 Stars. Anyone can ""wipe the slate clean"" and ""start over,"" but in the long run ""who cares,"" since it is ""all about the challenges."""
2,Not what I thought it would be.,This is what it says I guess. You play for a few minutes each day....however after a few minutes of playing you are done. I thought there would be more to it than there was. Dissappointed but my 10 year daughter loves it. I would not recommend to friends my age.
4,Brain Age 2,"Love it. Very challenging puzzles, great way to pass the time. Definitely notice faster reaction time in my ability to perform basic calculations or make logical connections between arguments. Originally skeptical that games like these would improve my cognitive abilities..."
3,Very inconsistent handwriting recognition,"This game is frustrating. The handwriting recognition works just well enough to make the game enjoyable and challenging. But the same handwriting recognition also fails enough times to make you cuss at the game more than you should.The games are extremely time sensitive. A difference of even one second makes all the difference in your score. I must admit the frustration level reaches a high level when a score is substantially reduced only because the handwriting recognition misconstrues say ""4"" as a ""21"".I have some doubts whether this game makes a person more mentally acute. The game's origin has some dubious scientific authenticity.Overall, I half recommend this game. It would be so much better and far less frustrating if it had a more consistent handwriting recognition."
3,Wish it was more fun.,"First off and most importantly, I don't think you should bother buying this game.Just rent it and see if you like it like I did first. It's OK but it gets boring kinda fast.There are various games to play but only some of them are fun. I have yet to unlock all of the games but I must say that the ""Piano Player"" mini game is by far the worst. It doesn't feel intuitive and I was actually looking forward to it.""Rock Paper Scissors"" is fun though once you get the hang of it. But it drags out too long.One of my favorites is ""Memory Sprint"" which basically has you following one of the men as he is in a race. Many men will pass him and you have to see what place he finishes in. He will be passed first and then he will gain speed and fall back again over and over until he hits the finish line. I could play that game for a while.But really, don't waste your 18 bucks on this.3.2 stars."
5,hurray for learnin',"this game is a lot more fun than i thought it would be. i am not a ""gamer"" and really enjoyed the experience."
4,Brainage II,It's a little more intricate than the previous version. The voice activation is better than version one. This version is a lot more challenging and you shant be bored.
3,Brain Age 1,I'm glad I got this game when I did. Apparently I need to really work at exercising my brain before it is too late.
3,Good game,"The only problem I have with this game is the rock, paper, scissors part. Sometimes it doesnt hear me or recognize what I am saying. Other than that, fun game."
4,Excellent!!!,Excellent game if you like puzzles. Makes you actually feel like you are working your brain. You cannot get to a game though without reading all that the guy has to say which is sometimes irritating.
3,OK but unresponsive,It would be a great application if it would quit misinterpreting my voice and handwriting. For a 'test' based on speed and accuracy this is very frustrating.
4,Does exactly what it promises,"Brain training is great. The more you train, the more options you're given to play."
5,"Great shoe, fabulous price","Great shoe, very cute with the usual true to size Mia fit. Great with dress pants or jeans."
5,BNL Sets the high water mark for Alternative,"I remember hearing this for the first time on tape in my friend's car. I was happy to finally figure out who did ""Be My Yoko Ono,"" which I had heard before. The album really stuck with me, being as off-beat as They Might Be Giants, witty as Ogden Nash, and resonating with me and my experiences, particularly Grade 9. I picked it up soon after, and it was one of those albums I listened to over and over. It goes from being whimsical to moody to satirical, but is almost always up-beat. All the tracks on this are strong, with particular favorites being Grade 9, with its Rush tributes, and If I Had $1,000,000. Also look for an unexpected insertion of Styx's Mr. Roboto, and a slam dunk against New Kids On The Block. This is their best album to date, and the best place to start."
5,Makes you feel like a Lady and still want to be Naked!!!,"The first time I listened to this CD was in Jakarta, when I shared a rent house with a Canadian. I work in advertising I thought...WOW!!! Someone should read the copy they wrote!! Excellent! I like ""Box Set"" the most cause it always gets me to dance. ""$1,000,000"" is light but entertaining, like listening to a stand up comedian, and I think ""Grade 9"" is hilarious and very funky. Now, three years since the first I heard it, I live in Holland and still listen to the CD and still dance all the songs. What can I say. IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! You must buy this CD or you miss the greatest music, fun and laugh!!"
5,Listening to BNL,I listen to BNL mostly everyday. And to listen to all the songs and really understand what is going is awesome. I believe that listening to BNL will make you happy when your sad. Since I broke up with my boyfriend all i listen too is BNL and i feel alot better. And when I'm really having a bad day i stay home listen to BNL all over the house and have fun with singing there lyrics.
5,Greatest BNL Album ever!!!,I absolutely ADORE the 'Ladies and this has to be their greatest album. Grade 9 cracks me up every time I hear it! Their music can be touching and sweet or fun and playful...100% pure musical genius at work here!! :D
4,"Their first, their best","Listening to ""Gordon"" is always a good time for me. It is not the best album ever recorded, but the young group of five demonstrated their versatility. The band's early days are well documented here and you can see how immaturity played a role in some of the songs. But the antics of such songs as ""Grade 9"" and ""The King of Bedside Manor"", are balanced nicely with the serious and slightly meloncholly sounds of ""The Flag"", ""What a Good Boy"" and my personal all-time favorite ""Brian Wilson"". They have a knack of writing upbeat songs with darker undertones. And the combination of melody and lyrics makes it hard not to sing along. You can see how it began with this album. I enjoy all of the band's recordings but I always seem to find myself coming back to ""Gordon"", their first and, in my mind, their best."
4,This is a good start!,"Of course, this is their first alblum, so you can't expect it to be perfect. My favorite song is ""The Flag"", about a girl and her abusive boyfriend. It's a serious matter and the guys really did it up. Good job!"
5,"Fabulous, a must have of any BNL fan","The '92 debut of the Ladies was a great way to start. Like in the later 3 albums, they have a great mix of sound with jazzy tunes, as in ""Hello City,"" and great acoustic rock with the hit single ""Brian Wilson."" The always popular song at their live shows, ""If I had $1000000,"" is on this record and keeps the happy flow going. These are the classic songs that put BNL on the map and the c.d. really speaks for itself."
5,I cannot rate this one highly enough,"BNL's first album establishes them as a seminal force in the world of nutty music. One listen and you too will be humming along with the catchy riffs of ""If I Had $1m"" and singing lyrics like ""You can be my Yoko Ono/ You can follow me wherever I go"".A truly unique and distinctly impressive effort from the best thing to come out of Canada since maple syrup, ""Gordon"" is BNL at their best, an album for the ages that should be at the forefront of any discerning music collection."
5,BNL's Best!,"The Barenaked Ladies is deffinately my all time favorite band! And this is their best C.D.! BNL is the most diverse band I've ever heard so their's a song to fit any mood you're in. Trust me. Buy this C.D. You won't regret it. (If you like Gordon, check out BNL's other C.D.s too.)"
4,"Very good, but Stunt and Maroon are better","(See my review of Stunt, to start with.) The reason why I say that I like Stunt and Maroon better probably has to do with a maturity level (and probably MY maturity level), but I did enjoy this album. I just don't reach for it first when I think I need a BNL fix. Best tracks: ""Brian Wilson,"" ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me,"" ""I Love You,"" and, this should go without saying, ""If I Had a $1,000,000."""
3,Too cute,"This CD is like a hamster. Cute for a little while, but gets old and finally one day you find him dead in his cage. Okay, maybe not so much like that last part. But here the Ladies were trying to be a little too cute. And there are so many chords and stuff borrowed from other artists, it's a wonder they weren't sued. Buy it if you like that TV show Barney & Friends. If not, I suggest something like Maybe You Should Drive or Stunt, where the Ladies are at their peaks."
5,ABBA DELICIOUS!!,"This video had to come out because frankly they were only able to put 19 of their biggest hits on the first video and they had quite a few more than that. What you discover with any ABBA video is that they were quite well done for their time. This set includes the magnificent songs ""The Day Before You Came"", ""When All Is Said And Done""; ""Eagle"", ""One Man, One Woman"", and lots of others. There is not a loser in the bunch."
3,Good but not great...,"This videocassette was a bit of a dissappointment to me first of all because unlike ABBA Gold, not all the songs from the matching CD were included. Secondly, this video didn't quite reach my expectancies in the quality and creativity of the videos. But nonetheless, ABBA are still the best in my very-dedicated-crazily-hooked-ABBA-fan mind. And one strong point of this collection was that my two favorite songs from the CD were included: Summer Night City & When I Kissed The Teacher."
5,One of the best,"I am a fan of ABBA since 1980 ,no one has made an impact on international music as they did.my favouriet song is OUR LAST SUMMER."
4,Great condition,"While it took slightly longer to arrive than I expected, when it did arrive I was very pleased. The book looked almost new and was in excellent condition. I have read other books in this series and this one fits in with the theme."
4,francoise goes 80s new wave,"i have to say i love this album, though it may not be to the likings of fans of francoise's 60's girl group bubblegum pop. this is something like francoise does synth pop, early 80s style. i think it's genius, but i may be biased since i had this album on tape in the early 80s. but there are really lovely moments - ""reve de starlet,"" an achingly poignant casio-tone carnival ballad about a suicidal starlet (think tom waits covered by betty blue) is one of the loveliest songs of its genre (i.e. the circus sideshow pop tragedy genre - one of my perennial favorites). and ""villegiature"" has the charming retro quality of sounding just like an 80s TV jingle for a travel agency - also brilliant. what with 80s chic being back ""in,"" there's nothing not to like about francoise hardy's new wave phase!"
1,TOXIC and dumb - Avoid,"Very, very strong smell of spraypaint. Not subtle. Smell intensifies when beads are stored in the container. We received this as a gift for our 2 yr old, and she liked it, but we discarded it after a couple of days due to the strong chemical smell, in order to avoid further exposing our daughter or ourselves. The problem is compounded by the ridiculous name of this product -- Smart Snacks. Are you kidding me? How is this a smart snack? How is it a snack at all? Why encourage a child to potentially eat one of these poison pills? WTF? There are lots of other safe, sensible lacing toys for families who love their children (e.g. those from Plan Toys)."
3,Lacing Sweets that can't be laced,"I bought this product for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. Each piece of candy has a capital letter on one side and the corresponding lower case letter on the other - a good thing. My daughter loves that they are candy shaped and she can scoop them out of the candy jar and play with them. I love the fact that everything fits into the ""candy jar"" and stores away very nicely. However, the main reason I bought this was so she could practice lacing and make words at the same time. It is very difficult to get the shoestring through the hole. As an adult I had a hard time. How is a 4 year old suppose to do this. If your goal is only to play with the letters, then this would be a fine gift, but if you actually want to lace them, rethink your purchase."
5,Smart Snacks ABC Lacing Sweets,"My children, 2 1/2 year-old twins, love playing with these beads! They are very colorful and fun for little hands to hold. I found them to be a great tool for teaching abc's as well as colors. Even though the age says 2 years and above, I was still a little concerned as a choking hazard because they are small enough to put in the mouth. If your child is still prone to putting things in their mouth, I would wait till they are a little older. My son who is 4 also loves to play with them."
2,Not as sweet as I thought,"My two and a half year old daughter got these lacing sweets as a Christmas present, and was very excited to open the box and play with the pretend candies. The only problem was that the laces did NOT fit through the holes. We tried many different candies, and none of them seemed to work. I finally pushed the lace through one of them, but my daughter was more than frustrated when she could not do it herself. Also, the laces are very, very short. I expected more for the money. My daughter does like to use the scoop that it comes with- she scoops the candies in and out of the cookie jar. Then she asks to have some ""real candy. "" Not a good toy."
2,Choking hazard,The manufacturer actually lists this toy as being for 2-5 yrs. Our 20 mo. old and 35 mo. old both enjoy putting the candies in and out of the the jar. The scoop the candies back into. Lacingings worked but needed to be done by an adult. Still I thought it would be good to work on learning letters.Wrong! The candies are small enough to fit in the mouth and big enough to block an airway. Age should be older than two unless they make the candies too big to fit in a mouth.
1,Does not hold 5 drives as advertised,"I received this item and was disappointed to find that even though the item description says ""the Storage Tower can accommodate up to 4 full height optical drives or 5 3.5"" hard drives"", you can not actually mount 5 3.5"" drives without purchasing an extra adapter for an additional $129.Buyer beware."
5,Perfect,"This perfum is adorable, lovely! I love when my boyfriend used the CK be. This product arrived in perfect condition and in the estimated date. I recomend this product and this seller for people who appreciate good scents."
5,"""Great Revivals"" is a must-read","Awe-inspiring, breathtaking, it'll knock the rust off your spiritual wheels and have you hungering and thirsting for more of God. The marvelous works of God in days-gone-by leave you praying for revival in your daily world. Faith-raising, doubt-dispelling. Totally must-read for most Christians, especially those whose persuasion allows for miracles, prophetic pronouncements, divine guidance...in other words, all Bible-believing Christians. All this book needs is an up-date on some of the people it applauds, in case they no longer merit such lauding, such as Yonggi Cho and Reinhard Bonnke. Send me your e-mail address and I'll send you a chapter of this book, see if you agree; just tell me if you want old (Wesley, Whitefield, Edwards...) or modern (Korea, Argentina, Africa...)"
3,DIETRICH AND THE DUKE,"In this first of three movies Marlene made with Wayne, we find the setting being the Seven Sinners caberet in the South Seas. Wayne's part was originally meant for Tyrone Power, but it was discovered that Wayne and Dietrich had a certain (if a little eclectic) chemistry together and this made their love scenes believably passionate. Marlene is marvelous in her role as Bijou as she parodies every South Seas island siren ever known to the hilt for the screen, and John is a fine rugged counterpart to Dietrich's sultry image. Dietrich sings three songs and her throaty voice caresses her numbers with her own brand on smoldering sensuality. The supporting cast is generally good: Broderick Crawford, Oscar Homolka, Albert Dekker, Billy Gilbert and Anna Lee."
5,Entertaining.,"I enjoyed this film, especially when Marlene gets to really act. That part comes near the end, when she gets a bit shook up. John Wayne seems rather awed in Marlene's presence (affair, maybe?), but is perfect as a Navy man. My favorite parts are Marlene's song ""The Man's in the Navy"", which she sings dressed in a Navy uniform, and the part where her character (Bijou. What a name.) is embarrassing the Navy guys with their stolen property. Broderick Crawford and Mischa Auer are in their element, also. The fight near the end is worth the price of the video."
1,Awfully bad erotic thriller with terrible performances,"Chris Young (PCU, Book of Love) plays a kid who has just shacked up with his new roomy played by Kristoffer Tabori (Brave New World, Braker). Tabori's neighbors consist of tough guy George Segal (Just Shoot Me, The Cable Guy) and his wife Tanya Roberts (That 70's Show, Sins of Desire). Young becomes fascinated by Roberts and eventually starts to worry about her because her and her husband Segal have alot of fights. Young even bugs their apartment so he can listen to their conversations. He then becomes more closer to Roberts and eventually the young boy sleeps with the mature woman. Things get heated and twists and turns begin to happen. Pretty lame movie with terrible performances by all and Tanya Roberts as a love interest? Please, come on. Segal shouldnt of been here. A waste of time this movie is. Boring as boring can be. Dont watch it is my advice but if you do I warned you."
3,Fits Parcially,"The Steering wheel cover only fits the ring, not the parts that go to the center of the steering wheel, which on this case (mr2) the original one did."
3,Got it scratehed.,I got my shelf brackets in reasonable time but they were not individually wrapped and scratched each other. This marred my first impression of the item. I will probably keep them and turn them so that only the unscratched sides show when the shelves go up. So buyers beware; if mine were scratched yours could scratch too since the satin nickel finish is only on the surface.
4,"Very abridged versions of texts, but a good primer of the classics.","Decent selections from the classics - Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Machiavelli, most notably. But the translations are likely to be different from what you've read before, and the selections (Machiavelli, Plato) are very abridged. If you need a good primer, or just want to brush up on your Philosophy in politics, this is a great book. Otherwise, I recommend finding the full texts online or finding later translations."
3,Humorous book that's worth a read...,"Humorous book about England written by an American who has lived there for over 20 years. The book has interesting revelations on a culture which is and is not similar to our own. Very well written and full of laughs. However, it became boring about half way through the book and I put it down (which is ok because the book is just a series of stories woven together).This is the type of book that you don't have to read all the way through -- you can read a few pages, put it down, and pick it upa year later."
3,Not as good as his later stuff...,"This book is somewhat of a disappointment after reading his later works like ""A Walk in the Woods"" and ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"". In this work, Bryson sets out on a ""walkabout"" around England before moving back to the States. He tries to convey the drollness and eccentricities of England's townships, but often misses and just comes up boring. Perhaps this book was not written for an audience outside the ""Small Island"". I would recommend bypassing this book and heading straight for his newer releases."
5,Bryson's talents are best displayed in this book,"Unlike in the more recent 'A walk in the woods', Bryson does here what he does the best: he describes people and situations, rather than scenery. In his descriptions of his experiences on several train journeys, and also of his time in a Dover bed and breakfast, he is quite brilliant. His summaries of the British people and their approach to life is at the same time incredibly accurate and very funny. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Astute and funny,"I believe that reading this book made me begin to fall in love with Bill Bryson or, at the very least, with his sense of humor. He wryly and wittily describes Britain as only a local can and invites us all along on the trip. This is probably some of the best travel writing I've encountered and I hope to read more by Bryson."
4,Helpful Background,"Having learnt of Bill Bryson via the Australian book (tape, really), I set out to read and/or listen to all his stuff. The man can use the language, wonderfully. Plus which, he enjoys the odd libation (it's a kindred spirit thing).I read ""Notes"" a couple of years ago, but reread it (twice) during business trips to England over the past year. I'll be traveling there again with my wife in September on holiday, so will take a copy along for us to lisen to as we drive around. Unlike Bill, I drive rather than endure the Britrail situation.You'll definitely get a flavour of England by reading or listening to this book. Even if you're politically conservative (as I am and Mr. Bryson most assuredly is not), I'm sure you'll take enjoyable things from it. The man can write.Enjoy."
2,What a disappointment,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to read this book. I hadn't read 20 pages before I realized I wasn't going to like it. I think the only reason I even finished it was I was stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read. I think my primary problem with the book was that Bryson just sort of wanders from one destination to another, telling us the travails he experienced getting from Point A to Point B. I didn't get any real insight into the British people. And there were several instances in the book where I was sure he was making things up for alledged comic effect. Several people have made comparisons between this book and Paul Theroux's ""Kingdom By The Sea."" I will admit that Paul can be kind of mean-spirited and doesn't seem to have a good time when he travels. But he is such a far superior writer that I felt I had a real sense of what Great Britain was about after reading his book. I got little, if any, of that with ""Notes From A Small Island."""
1,A cure for insomnia,"I love dhis book on Australia. I laugfed so hard it hurt and I got truly useful information besides. That wonderful book on Australia is a sharp contrast to this one.Read this if you need to have a cure for insomnia. This book reads like it was written by someone without an editor and is more frustration than education. It commits the sin of being boring. You may wonder if a book can be completely boring from cover to cover? I would say yes, although it ranges between deadly boring to only marginally boring."
2,Nothing Interesting,"This book has been placed in many different categories, such as travel and non-fiction. But in my opinion, it seems as if it is just the story of a bitter old man being miserable on his trip around England.There were excerpts of this book that were, in fact, pretty amusing. But overall it was relatively boring and hard to get through. If you're looking for an informative, fun travel book about England, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Paul,"Dont bother. I didn't make it half way through.Bryson comes across very shovanistic and codascending. He spends pages describing how much he dislikes the street names in London or the Chinese restaurants in Kent. Or the weather in whatever town he went to next.I was planning a trip to England, but now I'm not sure.I have read other Bryson books, such as "" brief history of nearly everything""or what ever it was called. But this book didn't work for me."
4,Notes from a small island,I can't stop laughing as I read this book! I started reading it on a plane trip to Chicago and I was laughing out loud (got a few sideways glances). It's my first Bryson book and I will definitely read others by him.
4,A good introduction to Bryson,"A charming, loving tribute to an adopted home from one of America's preeminent travel writers. Minus one star for a sameness to the approach (visit town with an obscure history, long trudge to get there, last-minute search for food that invariably winds up in a second-rate curry or Chinese restaurant).For comparison's sake, readers should check out the anti-tribute, AA Gill's The Angry Island: Hunting the English."
2,He's written better.,"Now don't get me wrong - I love Bill Bryson's writing. But this one seems to be from his ""early work"", where he mostly travels around and expresses his discontent with a city's architecture and planning. There's not a lot else to flesh-out the story. After a while it gets a little old. For something more varied and less critical, try ""A Walk in the Woods"". That is a great read. As is ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (go for the illustrated version). Those are both books that I eagerly read over and over again."
2,Not his best effort,"If you enjoy descriptions of frumpy resorts, slightly seedy restaurants and near-abandoned villages, this is for you. It pains me to give Bryson only two stars, it really does-but not as much as it pained me to slog through this offering to the bitter end. There are pages and pages of Bryson sitting alone in restaurants and waiting rooms, wandering through rundown tourism areas, and so on. The entire book feels like the journal of a man trying to kill five hours in a boring city between travel connections. Exactly the sort of situation where one longs for escape into a good book. This book isn't it."
2,Knackered?,"Being part English and having studied and lived in the US, I feel I have some common background with Bryson. I think he could have done more with this one. At times, he doesn't seem to enjoy himself in his trekking, and his sprinkling his stories with typically English terminology at times seems contrived. This was my first Bryson, I'll try more to try to figure out what the hullabaloo is all about."
3,Only if you enjoy boredom,"When I first picked up the book I was optimistic, his work being praised by those that had read it. His work on Notes from a big island was a huge success for me, so i was very disappointed with Notes from a small island. On the whole it was boring, Bryson always talking of his pet hates for bad architecture, among many, many other hates. He doesn't half moan about them all the time. In some parts he actually seems offensive, and when he shouts at the poor guy working in McDonalds, he just seems like a grumpy, bitter old man. There are however a few parts in the book that gave a smile to my lips, the well known 'Vodaphone man', and everyone knows a Mrs Smegma. I would buy this book if it were on special offer, but it would probably sit on my shelf and collect dust."
4,A charming and detailed walking tour by witty Anglophile.,"Bill Bryson captures something essential about England and the English in this loving account of his last trip through the island he called home for 20 years. Bryson, electing to use public transport and foot, encounters many amusing and frustrating obstacles as he navigates his ""green and pleasant land,"" and as his journey slows, so can the book. But his keen eye for detail and his self-deprecating humor make this a must for any American travelling to the Mother Country, and a delight for those of us already in love with her quirky people."
1,"yes, hate is a strong word but...","i LOVE bill bryson. but his voice ruined one of the funniest books i've ever read. hoping to return it. i've since discovered the seller will not accept its return because it's been opened. why would you return something you hadn't opened? how would you know there was something wrong with it? i listened to about 10 minutes of it and it's a good thing i did. as a gift, i couldn't send it to my friend. as a book to listen to while driving it would put you to sleep!!! so i'm stuck with this rather expensive disc i will never listen to. i don't think this is good business. i suppose it's a catch 22 situation. the seller thinks you'll just copy it and send it back. on the other hand, it's very easy if you have the apparatus to repackage something to look brand new so i don't know if the seller did this prior to selling it to me. this would be my first unhappy experience with amazon. i guess it has to happen sometime."
2,No Walk in the Woods,"I loved his Walk in the Woods and so I had to try this one. I did not even finish the second disc (audio version). I think that someone that spent time in Great Britain would likely enjoy this, but if not it just may not be your cup of tea. It wasn't mine or at least 1.8 discs of audio weren't. Could be it starts slow and gets better and I just didn't give it a chance, but for me it was nothing like his Appalachian trail hike and I ended up zoning and loosing interest. The part i did hear seemed to be a series of inside jokes about England. Perhaps if I had ever been there?"
3,"a love letter to the British, is sadly not Bryson's best work","An early work of Bryson's is a travel log of his farewell tour of the United Kingdom. Though there are glimpses of Bryson's characteristic wit and engaging ability to tell history, science, and other intellectually-stimulating yarns, the book is mostly just a log of his complaining about the architecture of British cities while eating at pubs. He does well to capture the unique culture of the British, but this is definitely one of his weaker works. I much more prefer his Short History of Nearly Everything, Made in America, The Mother Tongue, and Shakespeare: All the World's a Stage, to his travel writings. Still, Bryson is always a good read, especially when he so perfectly illustrates the very meaning of Anglophilemania. Grade: B"
3,Non Fiction,"An amusing account written by a yank who has spent quite a bit of time in pommieland. Probably a couple of others of his books are better, but this is ok for a quick, extemely light read and browse. It won't take anyone very long. The English can be funny, who woulda thunk it?"
4,What can be more fun than laughing over Britain,"Well, after reading Neither here, nore There, this book is slightly more story-telling and less so a row of laughs, but it is still a very enjoyable book with many humouristic features about the silly, comfy and stiff Great Britain. It is a good book to follow up on Bill and his writing but for the first time reader I would suggest to read Neither here nor There first, to get accustomed with Bill's humour and writing style."
2,"If you are in Britain, perhaps","Pretty funny at times, starts very well and the starting humor has a pretty universal appeal. After a while though Bill Bryson brings us through numerous boring places in England and the book just fizzles.Obviously, if you are British this book may be interesting to you but even then, most of the places he describes sound just about as interesting as would US travel chronicles through New Jersey, Newark, Flint, Buffalo or Detroit."
5,Bill Bryson,"Excellent book from one of my favorite authors. Laugh out loud funny, and shrewdly accurate in describing the England I grew up in."
2,Amusing enough in a superficial way.,"Bill Bryson is very popular with the British because he panders to their own self-image as lovable eccentrics. This book is a perfectly agreeable holiday read but utterly superficial. Also dated (written in the mid-90s, it refers in several places to the Conservative government). There's no reference to the problems that plague British society, such as alcohol and drug abuse, rampant consumerist materialism, over-indebtedness, issues with uncontrolled immigration and race relations, hyperinflation, cultural elitism, etc etc. OK, so it doesn't aim to be an in-depth social portrait of the UK, it aims to be a light and amusing read, and in this it succeeds very well. But I found the superficiality a bit cloying after a few chapters. A very light read."
4,"I enjoyed it, but...","My cousin loaned me this book knowing my travel habits. She was correct, BB and I have some similar ways of visiting a country. The author here describes his journey around Great Britain, and the book has much to recommend it. BB has a keen eye for detail and some well formed opinions. That said, every so often, he showed a mean streak which bothered me. Most days I might enjoy traveling with him, but there might be a few where he would get my goat, and maybe me, his."
2,Leave it on the shelf where it belongs,"This book has been in the best seller lists for a number of years and has had rave reviews. I was extremely disappointed in the book. I found very little humour and got irritated by Bryson complaining about architecture, transport, etc. This isn't a travelogue, just a sequence of towns visited with incidents on the way. As a Brit I didn't feel that it painted an accurate picture of the people or the place. I feel sure that there are better books that address the issues - leave this one on the shelf."
1,Tepid,"Maybe its me, but I just don't get Mr Bryson's books so it seems.Having been to Australia I picked up his version of his travels there and found it at best mildly amusing, and at worst inaccurate and banal, but as I'm open to the idea that maybe I started on the wrong book, I picked up this one as a secondary attempt to see why people like him so much.Now I know that negative reviews on here seem to be frowned upon, and hardly ever classed as helpful, but I'm struggling to find a positive. Yes, I know its not supposed to be a reference book, and is an individuals projection of the aspects of his adventure around the Uk which he found amusing / noteworthy and indeed, with a few pints in the pub and a few mates, the stories told may raise a chuckle or three, but in a book? Perhaps im just lacking an affinity with the author, but then... isn't that what the books he writes are designed to create? In which case, for me at least, it just isn't happening."
5,"FUNNY,ILLUMINATING & ALL SO TRUE","Bryson disects the British character with scalpel - like insight. The rituals & eccentricities of everyday life leap out of the page and in to your life. I laughed out loud at the sheer range of people he encounters. As somebody who grew up in England Idid not think an ""outsider"" could catch the feel and spirit of the country in the way Bill Bryson skillfully and amusingly achieves"
4,Not Quite Perfect!,"The thing that I liked best about ""Notes From a Small Island"" is the fact that by the time you have finished reading it Bill Bryson feels like an old friend. He is completely open with the reader and is not afraid to laugh at himself. Most of the humour comes from the fact that everything he says about the British is so true! I know that I often fall into the ""mustn't grumble"" category!I have decided against giving this book 5 stars, however, because Bill does tend to whine on rather about his obsession with cities and how modern architecture is ruining them. This book had me falling about in fits of laughter, especially the scene with the waterproofs, but it would have been ten times better if Bill had just cut out some of the rubbish.In conclusion, however, this book is a brilliant and enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a laugh."
5,The best and funniest account on travelling in the UK,"I have read 2 contemporary accounts on travel in the UK, that by Paul Theroux and Bill Bryson. Paul's fashionable left wing haughtiness and his propensity for meeting people he hates make you wonder why he bothers to travel at all except to write a book or meet famous people. Bill, on the other hand is always sympathetic to the locals, enjoys their company hugely and imparts his enthusiasm to his readers. He laughs at their foibles but never in a condensending way. And in spite of Paul's reputation as a serious novelist, Bill uses language much more effectively. And infinitely, more funny. Two Americans who have lived in the UK and travelled the world extensively ....Bill obviously enjoys living in this world much more. I wish he would make a trip to the East and write about it."
3,A Big Disappointment,"Rarely have I been so disappointed in a well-reviewed book. Mr. Bryson has a two-year-old's fascination with all forms of excretion and a teenager's predilection for a particular four letter word. Worst of all, however, he is a traveler-by-choice who hates to travel. The inconveniences --- poor food and accommodations, long waits for conveyance, boring fellow travelers --- which the seasoned travelers I know shrug off, at least in hindsight, with humor and good grace irritate Mr. Bryson as much as the daily commute frustrates the daily commuter. One gets glimpses of an interesting isle in between the complaints but, all-in-all, one wonders not only why he bothered to do something he obviously doesn't enjoy doing but why he thought the rest of us would be interested in reading about his manifest crotchets. If you read travel books for pleasure, try A Year in Provence by Peter Mayle."
1,a travelogue that makes you want to stay home,"Bryson reaches for at least one homourous quip per paragraph, and usually doesn't even raise a dry smile. As a travelogue it is totally unmemorable and uninspiring. It inspires me to stay home, to travel nowhere. The fact that this book is so popular in Britain just shows what a nation of narcissistic, air-headed twits they are."
2,"Shallow, jokey, trivial",Can only suppose that the success of this book is because it flatters the british ego. He says nice things about us in an amusing way. But as a thoughtful analysis of life in the UK it has little to recommend it. I couldnt be bothered to read more than a quarter of it. George
1,Don't buy it,I couldn't even get through the first half of the book on cassette of Notes From a Small Island. Most of the humour is mean spirited. It appears that he gets great pleasure of sitting next to an overweight family just because he can watch them and find a reason to make fun of them.
1,Farewell to Notes from a Small Island,"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it a great concept to travel around England by public transit or foot and comment on what he saw after living in the country for 20 years. So he walks into Oxford with a passing comment on the beautiful buildings and then spent paragraphs denouncing the shopping center. It seemed to me he wanted to be a stand up comic, but he failed, fell on his face or his posterior most of the time. He also commented in vulgarisms, too many times. The only thing I will give him credit for is being an ambitious walker, even in the rain."
3,Nothing special...,"I enjoyed the first few chapters, but after a while, my enjoyment trailed off into boredom, and I had to force myself to finish. Don't get me wrong, there are some excellent sections, but on the whole, not that good a book to sit down with if you feel like a truly *good* read..."
1,Couldn't finish this one....,"I've read five of Bryson's books so far, but this one has put the nail in the coffin for me-there will be no more Bryson books for a while. I'm about half way through it but am finding it increasingly difficult to tolerate Bryson's mean-spirited remarks about people he's never met. Bryson's comment that an overweight teenager was a, ""greedy, fat, pig"" wasn't funny at all. It was just mean, plain and simple...and this coming from an author who needs to take a look at himself in the mirror. In the last Bryson book I read, his wife comments that all he does is, ""b**ch, b**ch, b**ch. I agree with her. I find this book to be repeatedly filled with whining, and mean-spirited comments about people Bryson has never met and places he doesn't spend enough time in to know anything about. If you want to read good Bryson books try, ""A Walk in The Woods"" or ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"". This one will will be going out, half-finished, with our summer tag sale items."
2,Depressing!,"I am a dedicated anglophile, so I thought I would enjoy reading this book. Boy was I wrong. As the above reviewer said, all Bryson does is complain. The whole book is about how things have gone from bad to intolerable since 1973. I read about 5 chapters before I went into a blue funk about my upcoming trip to Great Britain. The book is going back!"
4,Some people just don't get it,This book is extremely funny. Reading some of the reviews I realise that some people just don't get it.. This is not meant to be a travel book or meant to help a would be traveller to the UK. It is about a man who decided to retrace his arrival into the UK 20 years ago and then goes for one last trip around the isle. It is funny and well worth the read.
5,Read This Book,"If you are even slightly interested in England or in the English, read this book. It has been years since a book made me laugh out loud. This one had me laughing so hard, I kept reading passages over and over. I even called my friends to read them passages over the phone. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
2,An Excellent Short Story...,"...but, sadly, not a novel. Bryson has moments of brillance. His observations are witty, and he is able to decribe the British culture like no other. But he needed a strong editor to make the tough decisions about what to leave out. Bryson made all of his points (and his most cogent observations) half way through the book. He did not need to continue to make the same observations over and over the rest of the way. Overall, I was disappointed. The book started with such promise in an English port city. His description of the B&B landlady was tearfully funny. Unfortunately, the book never got any better. Sometimes, Bill, less is more."
2,A Major Disappointment for this Bryson fan,"I loved ""A Walk in the Woods"" and ""In a Sunburned Country"". They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia. I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation. I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless. I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited. It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain. I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England. In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon. If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself. I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable."
4,More Bryson goodness.,"I recommend this book for Bill Bryson fans, but not perhaps for those just starting out with his books. I really enjoy his audiobooks read by the author, but this one is read by the capable but somehow inappropriate David Case. While his British-accented voice is clear and he tells the story well, I can never quite escape the impression that he's reading with a slight sneer, as if putting a sarcastic feel into this tale about his country by an American. I like the story overall and it helps complete the biography of this worthwhile storyteller."
4,"Not His Best, But Still Worth Reading","Although Bryson has got to be the wittiest travel writer around, I wasn't as enchanted with this book as I was with his shorter--and nastier--Neither Here Nor There. In this travelogue, he decided to take a sort of celebratory tour of Britain just prior to moving back to America after 18 years. His goal--largely successful--is to accomplish this all via public transport or foot. Bryson does lots of riffing on various aspects of English culture, often to humorous effect, and never fails to highlight his own mistakes and shortcomings along the way. It's a largely successful book in that he manages to recommend certain destinations and express disappointment at others in a fairly judicious and witty manner. He's also good at highlighting the differences in scale between the U.S. and the UK, not to mention the differing sense of history each culture has."
4,A wonderfully funny insight into rural England,"Bill Bryson manages to put into words what many of us ""Brits"" feel about the quintessential English way of life. Tea at Eleven and crumpets before bed. His travels around the country and his encounters with the dreaded landlady are memories of every middleaged man in England and his holidays with parents in the bleak seaside weather of an English coastal town. A great reminder of how holidays were and perhaps should be."
3,Britain is in fact more than just England,"Whilst this book details the character of English people and their surrounding it does not convey the character of BRITISH people. Once again we have a well educated author forgetting (after 20 years in Britain) that the Small Island he refers to is actually made of 3 nations as opposed to one. Britain is in fact a combination of diverse cultures and languages from Wales, Scotland and England. This book, albeit stunningly well written does not cover the diversity of Britain, but concentrates on England. All too often, foreigners consider England and Britain to be one, mainly due to authors forgetting any Geography lessons they might have had at school. I admire Bill Bryson's wit, sharp eye and commentary but this time I do believe he has chosen the wrong title for his book."
4,You don't want to go THAT way...,"How very true so many of Bryson's images are! Anyone who has seen the UK Comedian Harry Enfield will immediately recognise ""you don't want to do that..."" as a character alive in Bryson's book. I realised the honesty of Bryson's insight into the Britons when I found myself having the car direction conversation in a pub too! And who among us British has not had to endure wet Bank Holiday outings, much like the trek up the mountains.Recommended for ""natives"" and anyone who wants a hilarious insight into the British way of thinking."
5,Humorous and effective travel book - best of both worlds,"At first I was reluctant to read this because I figured it would be a Rick Stevesesque annoying travel book that tried to be funny. On the contrary, this book could stand alone as a comedy book as well as a litany of occurrences that detail what to do and not to do when travelling through Britain.At some points Bryson feels a little inclined to rant and whine, but it is in a generally good-natured way and he always has a point. His descriptions of characters he meets and endless ability to make fun of himself and his mistakes make this a true pleasure to read.Honestly, if you are going to Britain and want your normally resistant family to read a travel book about it, just get them started on this and you'll find that all the family members will be clamoring to read chapters aloud in the car. Simply a great, informative resource."
3,The usual Bryson-fare,"If you like Bryson, like I do, it's a fun read. The sense of humor perhaps a little too predictable by now, this is no ""walk in the woods"" where my sides hurt I laughed so much. But nevertheless entertaining, although I think I am about done with his books."
1,big disappointment,"This was my first, and probably last, Bryson book. Somebody just recommended another of his books, and while shopping for that I noticed this one, which had mostly good reviews and seemed like a great choice since I am about to make my first visit to England.It is very rare that I don't finish a book, but about a third of the way through this I couldn't make myself go any further. There were a couple cute things but overall he is not funny and is often whiny and insulting. I really don't get what people liked about this book, but I was definitely disappointed."
2,Not Bryson's best travelogue,"I've enjoyed ""In a Sunburnt Country"" as well as ""A Walk in the Woods."" In both books, there were plenty of exploring, interesting history, and witty dialogues. In this book, he explored Great Britain on his own so not a lot of dialogue. Some of the history was interesting but most was flat-out boring, as I found in my history courses in school whenever we had to touch upon British history. And exploring he does, but it got pretty repetitive. I am sure Great Britain is wonderful and I do hope to get there one day, but Bryson really made this place seem boring. Sure he had a few humorous remarks here and there that kept me reading, but I struggled to finish. Usually Bryson has me planning a trip, but with this book, he had me planning a snooze!"
1,Mean spirited,"After loving A Walk in the Woods and In Sunburned Country, I bought Notes from a Small Island. It was disappointing. It seemed mean sprited to me in that he took shots at people without letting the reader know why they deserved it. At first I thought okay, maybe it's just me. I put the book down and went back to it weeks later on several different occasions and just couldn't get through it."
3,Hilarious but shallow,"This is my first Bill Bryson book. I spent the last one year in England and I can readily see the truth in some of his observations - the weather and getting from point A to point B are very English subjects of conversation. The English are eccentric, witty and loveable. I found myself laughing out aloud may times but I must admit some of the humour is forced. And halfway through the book he stops offering any worthwhile insight into the towns he is visiting (except may to criticize the town planners, architects etc). Most of the times he is just in and out of trains or buses and looking for a place to eat. A good laugh, but not a travel guide by any means. Nevertheless you will enjoy it if you have already visited Britain"
1,"Dissapointedly overrated, opposite of ""Mother Tongue""","Having read Bryson's ""The Mother Tongue and How it Got that Way""(a terrific book), I thought he found so much fault in all around him that I just couldn't finish this diatribe. I was astounded at the depth of his angry ranting against the people he met, the architecture and their society. I was so surprised, having read a number of positive reviews to find this book without much to recommend it."
3,a bit of a disappointment,"After reading a few other of his travel books, I found this one to be a bit disappointing. The beginning was the most entertaining, then I found it to get a bit repetitive and unhumorous - as if there were some boredom with the trip itself."
4,Another hilarious Bryson tour,Travel writer Bryson keep a firm tongue in cheek as he makes the rounds of his adopted country before returning to the United States with his family. Anyone who has spent time in Britain will chortle with wicked delight at his experiences.
3,o.k if you have nothing better to do,This was the first Bill Bryson book that I read and I have to say I was not that impressed with it.I must say though that there are some quite enjoyable bits for example the 'mobile phone' man. There is also some good humour in this book and some of the cameos that are shown are really heartwarming(the poor family in the museum). Apart from this though I thought the book was a little bit repetitive and tended to lack any adventure. It was quite bland and Bryson tended to ramble on a bit. He was also quite rude and out of order with some of the comments he made for example ''a parkinsons convention' was not a joke but a sick and pathetic attempt to raise a laugh. Overall the book was not badly written but I have to say honestly I did not enjoy it.
2,A little... dull?,"Was this book a product of cobbling together a series of travelogues written independent of each other? While Bryson's prose is... interesting, if a bit vulgar in his attempt to be ""outre,"" this book wearied me. Perhaps it was the redundancy. Or maybe the repetititiveness. Or maybe... ah, you get the point."
3,notes about small complaints...,"Bill Bryson travels his adopted homeland of Great Britain and his observations about the people and places take the spotlight in this travel diary.This is classic Bryson. Lots of acute observations, some dry humor along the way, and many adventures. While I enjoy Bryson, his writing is not for people who have not been to the place he is talking about. I enjoyed his other book ""Neither Here, nor There"" much more as I had been to Europe and the places he had been to in that book and therefore found his observations much more amusing than in this book.I actually put this book down. It was entertaining for sure, but I just got sick of hearing about England after awhile. I will of course read Bryson again, but this one was just not a fave.three Stars."
2,A Bryson disappointment,"After reading Sunburned Country, Stranger Here and Walk in the Woods, this book was an astounding disappointment. I expected the same sarcastic wit Bryson is famous for, but instead I found myself reading a depressing list of gloomy towns in the UK with unending descriptions of rain and fog and how the names of British towns and streets are more entertaining than those in the US. After reading this book, I could tell why this was not one of his more famous ones. If this had been the first book I read by Bryson, I may have enjoyed it, but from reading his other books, I came to expect from him more than the average author."
4,Good Chocolate/Coconut bar,"Wish it were a little less sweet. And, I wish the company would have responded to my inquiry about GMO Rice Syrup. But, this is a good bar. The chocolate is nice and dark and the coconut moist and chewy."
4,Tasty - Unusual,"I bought these because I had another kind of bar that they offered, and thought these sounded interesting. They are - I think they're great, and so do the Indian guys I work with. They're not terribly sweet, and the cumin adds a peppery spicy element.Quite good."
3,just okay,I purchased these as a snack for my gluten free diet. I feel they are just okay and I would not purchase them again. I prefer the sesame bars instead.
3,no strawberries!!!,"We get these all the time and my husband really likes them, however, this last package has been void of strawberries...Was something wrong with a batch that didn't get caught at the factory??"
5,Yummo!,"I have been buying these bars (without chocolate) for years and have recently found them with the chocolate. Our family of six loves them. They are a great bar to hold you over and give you extended fuel, made with great ingredients to boot. I highly recommend you try a box!"
4,cumin is not evenly dispersed,"this is a very high-quality product, as far as sesame bars go. not too hard or sticky, and very fresh-tasting. the cumin used in this particular bar is not evenly dispersed throughout the bars, and so one bite may give you a huge peppery blast, while several bites are just a nice sesame bar. they are very fragile, and often arrive in little bits, rather than solid bars."
1,old / stale,This product is old. the chocolate crumbles and it looks old. Maybe not stored properly? I could not return item as it is a food item and could not conveniently see how to get a refund. We have had this product fresh and it was wonderful. This was not wonderful by any means
2,Disappointed with this box of bars,"The concept is good. I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup."
1,Ew.,"I bought this bar at a health food store, thinking it would be tasty, somewhat healthy snack. After eating the first bite I literally almost threw up, the taste was horrible. It tasted like it had a solvent in it, radiating a disgusting taste in my mouth. I checked the package and it is not expired. Now my stomach hurts."
5,"Mon livre préféré, jusqu'ici!","Croyez-le ou non, j'ai lu ce livre 2 fois, en anglais et en franais et je me suis tapé une audition en 5 cassettes. Le pire, c'est que l'an dernier j'ai suivi quelques cours en allemand et je m'étais dis que je pourrais pratiquer avec une édition originale.Bref, ce livre est un bijou. D'abord, c'est une ode à l'odorat (sans jeu de mots), au parfum (on devine le titre), à la passion, une seule. Puis, c'est aussi une histoire d'amour. En boni, c'est un roman policier plein de suspense.De grce, achetez ce livre et conservez-le dans un coffre-fort (c.-à-d. ne le prtez pas... il ne reviendra pas!)P.S. Ses autres bouqins ne m'ont pas impressionné autant."
3,thank you !,Thank you for resolving the issue with the postage. They were prompt to work with me on a postage issue. Not their fault. Thanks again.
3,"Unfortunately, Acesulfame Potassium (Acesulfame K) is a main ingredient","I would love these suckers if they didn't use acesulfame potassium, or Acesulfame K, as a main ingredient. In various rat studies, Acesulfame K produced lung tumors, mammary tumors, and rare types of tumors in other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned on August 29, l988 for a stay of approval by the FDA because of ""significant doubt"" about its safety.They taste great, but frankily, I'm afraid to eat them. Why not use Stevia instead?"
1,Sugar Free Assorted Fruit Lollipops Kosher & Gluten free,"I was very disappointed in these lollipops - when i ordered them they stated kosher and gluten free - what they didn't say that ""SPLENDA was ADDED"" false advertising - and a waste of my money. I tasted the sweetness in these lollipops."
2,A disappointment,"When I first got the book and read it I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping to read interesting stories that I hadn't heard about before. It was just another book that repeated the same stories about the Lockness Monster and others. I think that if you're a reader who is more than curious about the unusual, there are better books out there."
3,Review of Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries,"I generally enjoy this author's style and thought provoking content. However, I did not find this book to be at the same level of clarity and attractiveness of ""Beyond the Occult"" and ""The Occult"" (which in fact repeats some of the facts and stories in the attached book, which I am not sure is so good).Also, I find some irregularity in ""importance"" of the topics selected - some seem to be very personal cases (I am sure that that the archives of any solid police department may yield many more unresolved crimes stories and even more challenging than those in the book) and others more general. Mixing the two levels does not give a very good impression. Nevertheless, this book did not ""put me off"" the author yet. I am inclined to give it a very large 3 stars, but still in my opinion it does not make it to 4 stars."
2,Disappointing,"Reads like a book written 40 years ago. The author touches on the usual subjects of the genre, but addresses a few mundane stories (Dillinger's death, et.al.) as mysterious. There is at least one ""mystery"" in this book which has since been explained, and quite publicly and acceptably to those astute in these matters. Also, an annoying number of grammatical and spelling errors distract from the stories (spelling Dr. J. Allen Hynek's name as ""Hyneck"" and listing CSICOP as ""CSCIOP"" are examples.) I admit I didn't finish reading this book...there are too many finer volumes in the genre to enjoy."
4,"It's good, not great","First, not to overstate the obvious, but if you bought the starter box and the previous limited edition releases then obviously you should buy this just to complete your limited edition collection. We get to find out about Esther, Abel returns, we get to see more great fight sequences, etc. And we get to see a very significant flashback sequence that explains a lot more about Cain and Abel. It's not a perfect ending (but then, neither was the series) but there are still lots of great and tearful scenes along the way."
2,the end of the anime Trinity Blood,"Lame. totally lame. There was such a build up and then...huge let down. I realize the creator had died and that affected things, but still. Lame. we're talking they probably ate lead paint chips with paste on them in kindergarten lame.and for what ever reason you get through all those 20 tears of Abel dying and he reappears as this freaky blue naked thing, then is latter shown normal trapsing around the country-side with the Earl of Memphis. All I can think of is, well while you were at 100 percent nano machines what the heck were you doing letting him get AWAY?rent it. don't let your hard earned cash get sucked into this.and just think, I actually adore Trinity Blood. its just the ending of the anime that sucked big time."
2,uh,"not much to say, except that I no longer love this series. This was a huge disappointment. But ended in typical anime fashion...."
5,"Fast, Wonderful","Product was exactly what I needed, and it arrived very quickly--I couldn't be more pleased !! Thanks !"
4,Mr Coffee Brew Basket,Mr Coffee Brew BasketThe brew basket fit perfectly and it works just like the original one. I'm very pleased.
1,error,"Even though I sent the model and #,I was sent the wrong basket. I was disappointed and unable to use my coffee maker."
4,Brew Basket - Perfect Replacement,"Not much to say. We broke the bottom pouring mechanism on our previous basket when it was dropped during cleaning. This brew basket fits my Mr. Coffee 12-cup machine perfectly. It may be slightly improved over the older model because it seems to clean up more easily. We had the previous one (original with coffee maker) for several years, so it might be my imagination. At any rate, this is the correct replacement and it works fine. Much cheaper alternative than replacing the whole thing obviously."
5,Thank You....,"The product I purchased was exactly what I needed. It was described properly with not only a description but the model number, and was shipped quickly. Thank you!"
4,"Good, but why is s&h cost more than the product?","Fast delivery. Exactly what I asked for. But, s&h cost more than the product. What's up with that?"
2,If you love puzzle games and scrabble ....,"then I would suggest this book, but if you love erotica then I would say give it a pass.......Fiona, or Fee to her friends, takes off for a week's vacation with one of her girlfriends to a plush retreat where they are all paired off (oddly enough into male/female teams) to play in a semi-treasure hunt to win a prize left by a dead wealthy pervert.The book deals heavily with the clues and what has to be done to discover them. While searching for the clues everyone has scripted sex, what else would you have expected. At firat, I thought it was kind of cute but after a while I got really really bored with it all ..... again .... there no eroticism per-se just plain sex while playing scrabble and word games ...."
1,you get what you pay for..sigh,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I know my way around computers and wireless networks. This Hawking USB wireless adapter gave me the following issues:1) slow to connect, sometimes taking 5 minutes2) sometimes would never connect3) poor signal strength4) it died on me finally!I replaced it with a US Robotics USB adapter and that adapter does what it should. It connects very quickly once windows boots. It ALWAYS connects. It gives a great speed, and web-pages come up fast.I don't recommend the Hawking USB wireless adapter. The money savings is not worth your time and heartache."
5,Best reception after testing many others,"After trying a whole assortment of adapters from a variety of manufacturers, this one, and another one also from Hawking, consistently gave the best results. I have Version Z2, which another reviewer has posted a picture of. I used the drivers and software from the CD in the box. The current Amazon picture is the first Version.In order to have the adapter that will have the best chance of connecting, I tried many--including Belkin, Linksys, Netgear (several), Buffalo, and Motorola. This Hawking performed the best, and often was the only one that would connect when the others wouldn't. I took the rest back.I feel quite satisfied with this one, after trying so many others."
2,This movies rating is way to high,"when i saw how high this movie was rated i was excited to see it, I regret renting this.the plot was predictable and boring the only reason i'm giving it two stars is because when there was action and fighting the fights where entertaining.He was petty and foolish in the beginning but all of a sudden he is this great leader, give me a break.This was a waste of my money and highly overrated."
2,product not in good condition.,"The movie was pretty good but the dvd is no good, there are some uneven surface in the dvd that cause the movie to slow down , stop, even stagger motion, I was planning to return it but I was so excited to received the item i throw the address of return place, clean the dvd, 2 x still no good, finally I saw the uneven surface, can you do something about it, thanks."
5,Legend of the Shadowless Sword,"Probably One of the Best Asian Martial Arts movie to date. The scenery, fight scenes, costumes, acting, and story line are among the best. Most martial arts movies center around the same theme or as I would say, ""If you've seen one you've seen them all."" For a first time Korean Martial Arts Film I would rank this in the TOP 5! Superb Job! It doesn't hurt that the two Korean women Actresses are HOT! HOT! HOT!"
5,Shadowless Sword - See.It. Now.,"My wife & I have been watching kung-fu constantly since we don't have channel 37 here. Shadowless Sword popped up on one of the pages when I was looking at something else. Other reviews got me to buy it and when we sat down to watch it, we were simply amazed. One of the best kung-fu movies I've ever seen, and from Korean kung-fu no less. Great story, great production, great filming. Worth every penny. Now wishing I'd purchased the blu-ray. See. It. Now."
5,Unsurpassed in the Wuxia genre,"This epic saga has all the hallmarks of brilliance, artistry, choreography, and script unsurpassed by any Chinese wuxia film. This Korean film is filled with articulate passion - beautifully executed on screen finding the artistic balance of wired movements and gritty martial arts. Well deserving of its cult following."
2,I know you want to watch this...,"...but don't. Or do. It's not a good movie. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is my favorite movie. Not the best movie ever..but my favorite. So maybe I'm a little touchy about the ripped off scenes - drums while having a flying chase running over the roof..hmmm..where have I seen that before? And the over-blown acting, and silliness of it all.But the fighting scenes are good and some cool camera work. And hot women with swords. Just go into it knowing it's bad and enjoy it. You're going to watch it anyways."
2,"Uneven, lumpy and not very engaging...","I want the two hours of my life back... ugh. Very improbable plot and it doesn't appear Koreans do wu shu flying as well as the Chinese, probably because the Koreans put alot of power into the flying sequences, when they are best done with grace such as in Chinese movies.Special effects are not well done. The water fighting scene was laughable. Also, the love story was too contrived and formulaistic if you are familiar with Korean love plots.All in all, it was a big yawn. I don't know why I persisted through the entire thing."
1,Not for American audience,This movie is more about Korean romance and some history than an actual good fighting movie. I just saw the movie and quite frankly am upset I saw it. It just removed 2 hours of my life and I want it back! One star PERIOD!
4,Good action movie,"Good action movie. Professionally made, good action sequences and story. Glad that I bought it."
3,Not on the level of the Shaw Brothers,"I am one of those hardcore martial arts fans and I try to not only see but own every great to good movie on the market, over the years I compiled a significate collection of films. At this point now I'm trying to view the Koreon style of film making thats why I purchased this movie, so far I found some simularites in the Koreon, Chinese and Japanese.But in my opinion the Chinese are by far superior the Koreons and Japanese show much more aggression and brutality where the Chinese are more artistic. This movie is a good combination of all three the fighting is fair not a lot of extended stand and fight but mostly cameras and effects. I could tell how the story line was going to flow which was'nt that bad and I was glad to see the women fighters steal the movie overall a fair movie not on the level that would have like to have seen."
4,Pretty Good Flick,"I liked it. I'm not an expert on Kung Fu flicks, but I thought it was pretty good. For me, I wish there had been a tad bit more fighting. The story was good, and the fight scenes were good as well. There was one scene in the water that I thought was a little corny, but overall it was worth renting. I only wish I had watched it on something bigger than my laptop or had at least rented it in HD."
4,The female lead rocked,"The lead character & her nemesis were very strong & determined. If I had one gripe, & it is not a big one, is the male lead sometimes gave off a contemporary hippy vibe. Other than that, really enjoyed it!"
5,great movie,like the swordfighting scenes. the plot was good and a bit unpredictable. second time I watched it and still like it
3,Old filth,"Easy read and revealed a situation I was not aware of, sending british children born in the far east back to England to be educated."
4,Old Filth is an interesting read.,It is very English but really a fun book to read. Filth is a bit eccentric and the humor is quite dry but I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.
4,Jay on Filth,"This is a revealing novel that deals with the product of the English of last Century sending their children ""back home"" from the far east to be ""properly"" educated. The title is a curious play on words!! Found it an interesting, informative, fun read that only occassionally became a bit confusing as to time, character and place."
5,Extraordinary!,"HERE is a novel by a truly talented author in full control of her craft! From the hilariously misleading title right to the last page this is a beautifully controlled narrative and darts back and forth in time without ever once allowing the reader to lose track of where in time and space the narration takes place.The clipped dialogue captures to perfection a certain type and class of old-time Englishman, of which Eddie Feathers, aka ""Filth,"" is one. His nickname comes from his having invented an acronym describing people like himself, who didn't succeed in London but who were very successful when they moved East: ""Failed In London, Try Hong-kong.""Without for a moment becoming maudlin, the author conveys the horrible toll taken on the ""Raj orphans,"" the children (like Filth) of British colonials who were sent ""Home"" to England and virtually abandoned there to the indifferent care of distant relatives, abusive foster-homes, and the occasional, ultimately unreliable, kindness of friends."
5,top ten list,"This book has joined my top ten list of all time favorite books. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. Funny, philosophical and bittersweet."
5,Death of an Empire,"I totally agree with all the superlatives heaped on this wonderful book. Usually I don't take the time to write a review unless I have something original to contribute, but since this is the best book I've read this year, I just had to add another positive to those already written."
4,Riveting and moving,"Sir Edward Feathers, born in Malaya, brought up by Malayan villagers, a Dickensian English foster family and English public schools, becomes a guardsman to the Queen Mary during WWII, a barrister in London, and a sterling career as barrister and later judge in Hong Kong.Now retired with his wife Betty, in a quiet little town in Dorset, he finds himself retreating back through the years, especially after Betty's death.A stirring, moving and at time humorous novel, the life of Filth (nickname given to him for Failed in London, Try Hong Kong)is shared with us through his memories. His cold exterior may be explained by his having had people leave him throughout his life, the death of his best and only friend, a disastrous sexual introduction that led to a cold sexless marriage, the rejection by his father and odd relatives. But the exterior hides a man who realizes later in life, that what he's been missing has been desire, a desire for life."
3,Modern Art - There are Better Choices Out There,"I love brainy boardgames, generally of the German variety but this one just doesn't ever get opened at our house. First, I love art and I thought the board game would actually talk about art in some respect. If they couldn't have used copies of real art work, at least they could have used real art genres. Second, there isn't all that much strategy to the game. Overall, I was underwhelmed. I like Ticket to Ride, Carcassone, Puerto Rico and Settlers of Catan better..."
3,Disappointing.... but review is subject to revision,"I had high hopes for this game; even going so far as to schedule a ""game night"" party with several families. The group included several professors (language), a CPA, a translator, AND a teenager, most of whom tried to get through the instructions but couldn't find the wherewithal.But, for me at least, the biggest disappointment was that both the art and the artists represented were really insipid. I was hoping the game would have presented tantalizing designs in dizzying colors, but most of the cards were the same palette of bland colors and the same small range of design ideas.Perhaps if the art cards had been more inspiring, the group might have found more reason to slog through the instructions (or at least to invent their own version of the game), and the auctions would have followed.If we ever get to playing this game, I'll review the actual game play."
3,A gentle romance makes a good memorial for Pamela Macaluso.,"Pamela Macaluso's book starts off in a snow storm which strands Patrice Caldwell in a line shack with Stone Garrett. The rancher was sent by the sheriff to rescue the city girl when she put her sporty little convertible in the ditch. She has no idea how long they'll be there, nor what can happen in a week. Although possible to fall into cliches with this plot, Pam avoids them deftly and gives us two passionate and rather bewildered people who never saw love coming until it was too late to avoid it. This is Pam's last book. She and her two children were the victims of domestic violence. All of us who enjoyed her romances will truly miss her."
1,THIS TOY IS TOXIC TO BIRDS,"Copper is TOXIC to birds, any one who uses this can kill their birds specially people who do not know copper is toxic to birds!"
1,SUCKS!,"It does the job , would have liked it already with something to hang on it in my cage. Too Short! I would skip this toy.."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent guide to the ceremonial as practiced in the Episcopal Church in the USA. Well, worth purchasing for any priest."
4,FRANCOISE WHO REDEFINED THE WORD BLUE,"Most guys would like to have a sister like FRANCOISE HARDY who is often blue but also romantic and has a way for making you feel good.In her early days, FRANCOISE was shy but that was part of her charm and somehow she always manages to let you go into her spider web.Melancholia can be fun to she tells us in many songs like LA MAISON OU J'AI GRANDI and COMMENT TE DIRE ADIEU which is also the title of her best album of that time.At 55 FRANCOISE is still going strong even though she has stop touring a long time ago"
3,"funny, well written stories","I really liked this book, but could only give it three stars. The problem was most of the stories condoned extra-marital affairs, and I believe in monogomy so the subject matter was a bit touchy. All the stories take place in a retirement community where a bunch of people live. The women are real yentas (busybodies) and you will especially enjoy the book if you are aware of jewish culture. The best story was the one about a new widower and all the old ladies who were trying to get their hooks into him. He was totally unaware of the reasons behind their actions. I also enjoyed the story about the old couple whose sons hate each other, and how much the mother wants them to be friends. I can relate, I hate my siblings and they hate me, and there is my poor old jewish mother in the middle!The book is an easy, fun read and if not for the extramarital affairs, I would have given it a 5"
4,An entertaining history of the breed,"This is a great book for Boston Terrier fans and fanatics. Detailed text and photos of the breed from the first ""official"" Boston, through the evolutions to today's breed standard. While not for someone seeking information on how to care for a Boston Terrier, this is a great breed history for those ""hard core"" Boston-lovers!"
5,Leaders of the the New school of D & B,"Great mix of D & B for the new century, Chase and Status are the ones to beat, BIG UP-ALL TIME!"
4,Great Job,This book gave me great information on this game! It gave info on the different types of routes and run types! It also gave defensive hints! This book also gave great team by team info on how to play with each team! I love this book. This book gives info on how to beat each team too. I recommened buying this book! I give this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars
3,Every game BUT Nintendo DS.,"This manual has everything you need except for DS. Can't fault the info provided, it is good but the lack of info for a new popular format leaves us with 3 stars."
3,Great Stragey Guide,This is the best guide if you like error's on some of the pages they had big gramatical errors. The play routes were the only best info I had.
2,Didn't work for me,"Doesn't seem to work for me. I got bites within minutes whether it was windy or not. I am sticking with my OFF Familycare Smooth & Dry spray with 15% deet. It works very well for me, and it was well reviewed by Consumer Reports magazine."
2,"On time delivery, but the wristband does not repell insert","Product arrived on time. But, I was disappointed when I put it on my ankle one evening to work on my lawn. It did not repel any mosquito. I saw a few mosquito landed on my foot trying to bite me. Better use ""off"" as it works."
4,"so far, no bites","Very strong smell, even sealed in two layers of plastic bags, it can make my cloth smell like the ring, haven't used it for long, so far no bites, knock on wood."
2,aphids,Does not work on aphids. Or the lower coacatostial stratum of blood sucking insects. Ineffective against Insect egg larvae as well (in hair).
1,Bug Band,Was overall pretty disappointed with this product. It doesn't fit well...or stay on well for that matter. As for it repelling bugs I saw no difference when wearing this band than when I wear no bug repellant.
1,Does not work as promised,"I have tried my bugband yesterday. I have put it around my ankle before going to my back yard. I want to report that although mosquitoes did not get my legs, I was bitten in my back and my arm. I suppose if one were to put a band on each limb and a waist it might work but it certainly does not do what the manufacturer promised. It even says on the packaging that it repels all kind of insects if it's attached to a backpack. I am afraid it's back to the spray for me."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with the bug bands. They did not work at all. In fact I got a mosquito bite right where the band was!! I would not recommend these at all!!!
1,Not Working,"We wore these on a camping trip and they were totally useless as far as we could see. The mosquitoes were pretty intense -- maybe with fewer mosquitoes, they might be more effective, but they did not work for us."
2,not very effective,"It was good for the area around the arm only, where I had it wrapped. For someone who suffers from average mosquito bites, I need something more protective."
2,Bite protectiing bracelet-hopeful,"Like the Bite Shield, one needs to have multiple more of these on each arm, leg, feet, in order to avoid biting insects. I have strong allergies against any type of insect bites, and this bracelet was far from being sufficient help. Maybe a small nuisance to those probably very tired flying or crawling insects but not for the ones with their usual intent to bite a human being anywhere they find an opening from a fabric."
5,good enough for a re-read,I bought these in paperback then donated them to the library so others could enjoy (and they are always checked out). I have often wished I had kept them because they were so good I wanted to read them again - and I do not usually re-read book - so I bought the kindle edition. I am constantly looking on Brenda Joyce's website in hopes the next book is being written. Well worth your time to read. A great series.
2,Not a romance,"This book threw me off because it said romance on the spine, but be warned this is NOT a romance. I might have liked this book if I did not read it as a romance. I expect more and it did not have the romance I was looking for. I felt no sexual tension between characters at all. It was a big disappointment for me. Maybe it works as a mystery, I don't know because I am not a mystery reader."
2,Hmmmmm--,"Knowing that I like to read historical fiction, romance fiction and suspense fiction, my librarian plopped this book in my hand. ""Look,"" she said. I looked. Nice cover, gorgeous step-back, (I like old houses) and then the ambiguity on the spine caught my eye. My library had catalogued the book as a 'mystery' but the publisher calls it 'romance'. That's only part of the problem I had with this book, which I did not finish--in fact, page 80 was the extent of my patience with it. I kept wanting something to happen. Almost anything would have sufficed. I freely admit to not ever having read anything by Brenda Joyce, although certainly I've heard of her. This book, however, didn't seem to know just what it wanted to be, and I really couldn't wait for it to grow up. Sorry."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I was horribly disappointed by this book. When I bought it I though it would be a romance mystery. Unfortunately,its not a romance. The most romance in this book is a kiss between two main characters who can never get togeather, in this book or any other in the seiries. unexpressable unrequited love that is not overcome is not my idea of a romance. In addition to this, the myster part of the story is a major let down, boring and predictable from a mile away. If you want a romance or a mystery get a different book about the only thing this book is a waste of time. And for all of you who think that this may only be the case in the first book of the series i'm sorry to disappoint, none of the others in this series change this situation."
3,Weak yet Strong,"This isn't really a romance book, but hints to be one. This book is more on mystery than romance. While we know that Francesca and Rick are the heroine and hero of this series, I do not feel that Rick feels anything for Francesca, from the beginning to the last page, even after Joel's last comment, which I was like ""duh... how did it seem so?""This book is weak by itself in storyline and definitely in the aspect of romance. However, let us not forget that it is the beginning of a series of romance mystery between Francesca and Rick, and the people around her.Deadly Love is like a small piece that makes up a big puzzle. While it may not be an enjoyment to read and does not live up to its expectations, Deadly Love, as the first book to the series, introduces and builds a set of characters we need to know for the future stories.Thus, I think I will appreciate this book more as the story develops when more books are released."
2,"Great beginnings, poor finish","I loved this book when I started reading it. I love the strong female character, the time setting and her family. It made for a very interesting story. But then it all fell apart. She became a sappy female, learning of family and friends secrets page after page after page after page. While the author sets the stage for more books, I don't think I will buy it."
5,The book every child should read,"Even now, at 24, I still can't get enough of Karl May's books. Each time I re-read them I find something new in them. Most of the books in my modest collection (28) are in Slovak or Czech, but I do hope to add some in English and German soon. What a pity Canadian children have no access to these books; these books helped to shape many European generations."
5,Should be read by all young people,"The only book we ever wanted as a child in Germany. I am now 70 , have some of K.M. books and still read them once in a while. ( about 20 times so far). Too bad young people have no interest in these books, but play on computers.They do not know what they are missing."
2,$9.95?,"I like the purifier. But, why isn't this thin piece of flimsy metal included with the $550 product for which it is intended?"
1,Should not have to pay extra.,"The product does what it is supposed to do, but I'm giving the company one star for not including this cheap strip of metal with all of their purifiers. It is beyond ridiculous to charge people an additional $10 to hang their expensive filters on a damn wall."
2,Kinda flimsy... could be more versatile...,"This is just a cheap piece of metal plate, pretty thin and feels flimsy. It's also not very wide, I wasn't able to find 2 studs that were close enough to properly mount this and when I screwed it onto a single stud with the center 2 holes, the sides bend away from the wall a bit when the Rabbit Air is hung. I had to improvise and screw the plate onto a 5-ply piece of wood and then mounted the wood+plate onto a single stud. Seems secure now..."
3,Disappointed....,"It's a little disappointing to pay over $500 for a product which costs $75 a year to maintain and is advertised as being something you can hang up on the wall, but you have to pay $10 for that feature....not to mention, it's just a flimsy, cheap piece of metal. Seriously? Besides that, Rabbit Air is amazing with excellent customer service - but this is a rip-off."
3,Functional but expensive for what it is.,"An expensive accessory considering what I paid for this air purifier. Didn't have much option, had to get it. It does keep the unit mounted on the wall."
3,Useful,"Being a relative neophyte to the subject of the Texas Navy, I tend to review the newer books with caution. It's so easy to fall into the trap of repeating the same old lore from previous works. Sad to say, this is how the book starts out. The same tired old folklore about Anahuac and Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn. (The author claims that Bradburn and his brother were jailed in Tennessee for stealing slaves. NO, this is another myth. Bradburn's brother drowned in the Duck River, but there is no record of any prisoners by that name. One inmate was accused of horse theft) But once the author gets into the post revolutionary Navy, the text improves. More often than not, the Army of the Republic gets all the glory, but the Navy saw it's fair share of action. Oddly enough, the Mexican Government wanted to HIRE the Navy to help put down a Centralist Uprising in Yucatan. Old wounds tend to heal rather quickly when you are outnumbered! All in all, this is still a useful book."
3,DC's Collections Dept. Screws Up Again,"It hasn't received much publicity, but DC screwed up big time with this TPB. It's a combination of the earlier Accross the niverse TPB with the PF format ""What Ever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"" collection and the Killing Joke one shot. well, when DC put this together someone forgot to restore the famous opening paragraph of WHttMoT which for the original collection was placed on the back in leiu of an original text piece.Now normally this might not be that big a deal, but that paragraph is famous and a powerful piece of writing. It might be corrected in future collections, but for now I'd recommend picking of the original Accross the Universe TPB instead and the seperate releases of WHttMoT and Killing Joke."
4,"Wanted Killing Joke, got so much more!",I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. A friend recommended I pick this up instead of buying just Killing Joke - glad I did as there is tons of awesome content here.
2,There's got to be more than this.,"I'll start out stating that the only reason I bought this was to own the Killing Joke. Well, that is pretty much the only reason to own this since you can't find that one-shot for individual sale anymore. If you are a fan of Alan Moore's work, then this should get your fix. Agreeing with a lot of other comic readers, this is not his best stuff though."
5,Review of Moore's 'DC Universe',"Classic Moore--what more can I say? These stories feature all of the creativity and careful language I've come to expect from the man. This isn't a good 'sampler' of Moore, because I'd argue his best works are full-length novels, but for one already initiated into his circle, this is a hearty meal."
5,Pure Alan Moore fun!,"Although not Watchmen or From Hell by any means, the stories collected here are some of Alan Moore's most enjoyable. From the excellent Superman stories ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"" and ""For the Man Who Has Everything"" to ""The Killing Joke,"" a dark look at the cyclical Batman/Joker relationship, this collection never fails to entertain. Also within this volume are brief, inspired looks at the Green Arrow, the Vigilante, the Phantom Stranger, and the Green Lantern Corps. Alan Moore, comics god, never fails to leave a mark and that is strikingly apparent in the stories contained within this volume."
4,There were these two guys in an insane assylum,This comic book is a good sampling of Alan Moore's work. The most notable highlight is The Killing Joke which is a classic for Batman fans.
4,AP Chemistry Text Book,"This text book was the most through chemistry book I have ever used. It gives examples of how to do almost every calculation that you need for the AP exam at the end of the year, and goes through them with you step by step, then proceeding to give you problems to work out on your own, and allowing you to check your work with the selected answers in the back. An all around great resource.It was shipped in wonderful condition and quickly."
5,The book was like new,The delivery of the book was fast and the book was in very good shape (like brand new).
5,coupler,"As far as couplers go, this one did the task I needed it for. A simple connection, yes. But without the coupler I was left without an option for connecting the cables together. This coupler did exactly as advertised, it did indeed connect the cables together. No tape, screws or other methods were needed to keep my cables together. Great product, I recommend this product to anyone in need of connecting cables together."
3,"No surprise, works as listed","It was shipped quickly and arrived at my house only a few days after I ordered it. It doesn't look very durable, but that is to be expected for this kind of price. It works alright...spotty connections are common, and the contacts usually have to be adjusted after it is reconnected. We have it connecting two long ethernet cables from an upstairs bedroom to an Xbox downstairs. The coupler is laying in a foot-traffic zone on the upstairs floor, but it doesn't appear to have been stepped on yet.Bottom line: It is functional enough to be kept around for this school year."
5,"Great coupler, cheap price","Amamax's coupler was a great product and was shipped extremely promptly. Would do business with again! It just couples two CAT5 / RJ45 cables together...and bam, you've got internet."
2,Loose connection,Cable connection is loose. I had to tape cables and this thing together in order to get a stable ping. Otherwise 90% packet loss.I tried several different cables and it was all the same.I ended up buying a 2-pack of similar couplers/slitter on a sale for the same price from one of Chinese stuff sites. They do work.
3,It couples RJ45 male to RJ45 male,"Works just fine. Bought a bunch of these for my IT staff in those instances where cables need to be extended in a pinch. I would not recommend them for long-term use, but if you need the, you will be glad you have them."
1,connectors,I bought 4 of these and 2 did not work. These are absolute junk. I didn't even bother returning them.
5,does the job,for as inexpensive as this was I was almost expecting it to break right away. Not the case. this little guy has done its job well. no complaints.
5,good product,I needed to connect my internet modem to my TV in another room. I ran cable above the basement ceiling tiles. This coupler works great connecting the 2 cables I already had.
5,Does the job,"This product is intended to connect two Ethernet cords to make, in essence, a longer one. Very basic. I don't expect it to do anything else and it doesn't. It does this well."
3,"Works, but could be built better","This product certainly works. My only issue with it is that it was built/designed poorly. Ethernet cables do not ""click"" into the coupler and easily slide out when connecting a cable in the opposite side. All in all, this isn't a huge deal, but you'd think that a product with ""high quality"" written as a feature wouldn't have this."
5,Just what was needed.,This little item was a complete life saver...came in a pinch to add extra cable length where needed...awesome little gadget.
4,Love it,Originally purchased from a very popular chain store. Searched on Amazon and found same item. Been using for couple of months and it works great!
3,"Cheap, but OK","Price was right. Coupler is kind of cheap, fell apart on first use. A little super glue and pressure took care of that. It works just fine, and that's all I needed. Prompt shipping."
4,Adequate,"This coupler serves its purpose, it connects wires. There's nothing wrong with it, the ports are fine and the speed cap is okay, but there's nothing special about it, it just connects wires."
2,RJ45 Coupler - Unreliable Product,"I purchased this to extend the range of two RJ45 50' eithernet cables, the biggest issue I had was that I had to tape these cables into this coupler seems I could not get a good connection. Finally just threw this item in garbage. Was cheap in price and, you learn that you get what you pay for. This was a product that was trash after spending over two hours or problem solving to find, it was the stupid coupler that I thought was suppose to do the job. It didn't do anything, I don't believe that the seller is bad or has any issues except that the product they sent was just garbage and, that's where it went into the garbage."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR MONEY,"This product doesnt even work. It's supposed to be an extender, but it's very shoddy and doesnt work. Now it's sole purpose is being a toy for my two cats!!"
1,Chinese Junk!!!!!!!,Folk's don't buy these couplers. They are shipped directly from China for .90 cents each TOTAL!How can there be any profit with a price like that unless there is slave labor involved ???Amazon shame on you !!
1,Doesnt work with either ethernet or telephone plugs,"The picture and description are not accurate, the coupler does not accept, or retain, standard telephone or Cat5e networking plugs."
3,cheap way to extend lan line,"works fine and its cheap,works fine and its cheap,works fine and its cheap.works fine and its cheap,works fine and its cheap"
5,Works so good I pooped my pants!,"What do you expect at this price? This won't cook my dinner, or clean my house, but it DOES let me link my phone line to another phone line!!!"
4,Does what it's suppose to,"Ok I don't know how much I can say about this product.. It does what it's suppose to do, it was a good price, I would buy from this seller again."
5,The best movie EVER,I LOVED this movie. It was a different type of movie for hilary. It was amazing and i can't get enough. i feel it sent an impotant message out
5,2 thumbs up!,"I saw this movie while babysitting kids, and I completely fell in love with this movie! As a teenage girl, I love the subtle romance and adorable boys! A perfect movie for girl sleepovers and having a girls day out. This movie is a complete chick flick!!!"
3,Raise you voice Music School movie,"This is a nice movie about a girl who goes to a Music School dispite indesision associated with chosing a college, I don't know what the big deal actually is, you can always pick a different major!:)But anyway the movie show the kinds of extreme characters you actually could meet if you hang out at such a place ."
4,Raise Your Voice,An entertaining story for any age and for any aspiring musicians. This movie has an excellent story line and I found it very inspirational.
5,Go see this,I havnt seen the movie yet because it's not out yet! But from what i hear it should rock! Hilary duff is sensational and everyone knows that. Its out October 8 th if i believe and i think it will be #1 at the box office!
1,This movie sucked sooo hard!!!,"I watched this one at a sleepover and I hated it!! I've never been a Hilary fan, but his was by far the worst movie yet!! Hilary duff is fake and she knows the cameras are on her, so she way over-acts!! Hilary is a fake, botox-infused poser that is not worth your time or money. In this movie she plays Terri and musical girl whos brother dies and then she doesn;t want to go to Music acadmy of whatever!! all the plots to her movies are the same: she falls in love with a hott guy, he does something wrong and then she feels betrayed and has a pity party and then he apologizes and they fall back in love. this is not worth your time or money and even little girls won't enjoy it!!!"
1,Loved it ..... not really!!!,"Hilary Duff is the best new actress that wants more money. All of her starring roles have wrought havoc on this generation's minds. The pretweens are being sucked and brainwashed by her bubblegum image. Most of her movies have flopped because they are all the same, just with different boyfriends. But anyway, the movie would have been better if it had someone else with talent."
1,Horrible,"Hilary Duff proves her incapabilities as both a singer and actress in this truly horrible family drama. Duff plays a high school student with musical aspirations. Her brother dies early on with a strange desire to send his sister to a performing arts camp in Los Angeles. So the predicatble happens and Duff goes off to the camp, connects with a boy, realizes her strengths, and overcomes her fears. Pretty melodramatic and trite.Duff has a charm about her but can't handle the demand of this role. Her character is given depth but her limitations as an actress keep the girl one dimensional. Keith David gives a Razzie worthy performance as the predictable strict father forbidding Duff to go the camp.The story is alright and James Avery (Uncle Phill from Fresh Prince) even pops up for an appearance, so that saves the film for a couple minutes. But ultimately the story falls flat through no realistic dramatic situations, lack of comedy, and lack of realism."
2,Tell me....What was the director thinking?,"A boring, sappy, preddictable movie about a girl running from bright lights! Come on! You've got to be pretty gullible to like this movie. Just because someone died, doesn't mean it's sad and touching. You don't really care about the person who died.Buy the soundtrack. That way, you'll have the ONLY good part about this awful movie."
4,I enjoyed this flick!,"I dont think this movie is really good for kids under 8. Because of kissing and there was no swearing in the movie every one is like "" This movie has swearing "" But it does not gosh! I love oliver james and hillary duff the plot was good the romance of the flick was really good I think it is personally best to be like 10 and up to watch it ( Wich i am ) I really enjoyed it.I was surprised at hillary duff drama acting!"
3,Raise Your Voice,"Hillary Duff's best movie to date. I really enjoyed the story line, which tells about a young girl who escapes home to persue her dram of being a singer by attending a summer music school. I think the music was not so bad at all. Speaking of music, there's a real cool extra feature that lets you make your own music. This is one teen movie that the entire family can really enjoy watching together."
2,What was the director thinking?,"This movie really sucked. It was very sad. What was the director thinking? Rent it first before you think of buying it. It's not good at all. If you want a great movie watch The Perfect Man, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper by the Dozen 1 & 2, or Material Girls."
5,Great!,"Romantic and capturing. Emotionally gripping. You will cry, but then you will be proud and rejoice. Loved it. Great movie compared to other movies Hillary has done."
4,A MOVIE REVIEW BY STAR GIRL,This movie is the best movie of the year. It is about a country girl who goes to a school to sing in a big city. She meets new friends and the love of her life. It is an extremely good movie. I hope you read it!
4,Good movie!,"Here's another well-done movie from Hilary Duff. Sad, yes, but it's realistic and death does happen in real life. However, it's very inspiring when you see how Terri Fletcher doesn't give up music and goes to the music school. It's funny in places, too. Yes, this is a film that's family friendly, which is quite usual for Hilary Duff. However, her latest movie, The Perfect Man, sounds bland, boring and compromised.All in all, a film worth seeing, maybe even buying."
5,This looks great!,"I have been following up on the details of this movie and I have to say that this looks like the best movie Hilary Duff has been in. This is a story about a girl named Terri Fletcher who lives in a very small town with a very large dream; she wants to sing. She applies for this amazing school for musicians and gets accepted. With the encouragemant of her mother and aunt, and despite what her beloved father says, she goes for it. She is not accepted by her other classmates, but she meets a boy who likes her. This looks like a great insprational movie with a great theme and looks like it will be a big hit.I will be one of the first to see it!!"
4,A mom's review,"I took my nine year old daughter to Raise Your Voice, with minimal expectations. I have to say I was surprised to find myself really paying attention. I also cried in several places, and then had to try not to embarrass my daughter!Hilary is an average actress & singer, but she has a sweetness and innocence that draws you in. I wasn't expecting the sadness, but overall I felt quite comfortable having my daughter view this movie.Several scenes were a poor copy of FAME, but I guess you have to be as old as I am to remember that. It was all brand-new to my nine year old.Mom gives this a ""thumbs up""."
1,NO!!!!!,why did Duff do this [...]!she sucks!!!!!!this movie is garbage. but you don't have to worry so are most of her movies.
1,This movie was...,"This movie was WAY too sad, it was also boring and predictable. The acting and music were good, but it was poorly written. It is not good for 5 or 6 year olds, because my sister who is 7 going on 8, had nightmares, and at 11 going on 12, I did not enjoy it!"
1,lame movie,"this movie's plot and all was old and poorly made. us usual hilary duff plays a girl who is trying to ""find herself"" or whatever. her boyfriend gets drunk. kissing is over the top for pg. a real dissapointment. i do reccomend a cinderella story, though"
1,This wont play in my dvd player at all.,This wont play in my dvd player at all. Not sure why? It was completely wrapped and disk was secure. I put it in to watch it and my dvd player says error. Every other dvd plays fine.
2,not recommended,"unless you're a teenager maybe, i wouldn't recommend this. some nice scenes but very light and not worth the time... not even for multi tasking..."
1,"What a self-conscious, self-obsessed bore the author is","It's like a really boring Mummy Dearest tell-all scandal book with no stars and no scandal - the poor dear was forced to traipse around Europe as a child, how awful.The guy from Salt Lake City hit the nail ont he head when he said: Reviewer: A reader from Salt Lake City, UT USAThis is an unbelievably boring childhood recollection of a boy with a poet father, who is hardly ever in the picture anyway. The jacket blurb raves about descriptions of a family friend, Leonard Cohen, but these descriptions consist of no more than a few lines when he happens to drop by the house. Overall, a big disappointment."
3,Good value for a generic system,"The cameras have a decent range from the receiver, approximately 350 feet in my case. As with all other 2.4GHZ devices, it may cause interference with your wifi or cordless phones. It sees very well in low light, and has a lower profile that most cameras. I have it mounted in the 2nd story window overlooking the street and you can barely see it unless you stare. ***Seriously, these cameras are TINY so keep that in mind.If you are thinking of buying this system to use with a 9V battery, only plan on about 2.5 to 3 hours of run time per battery (making it impracticle to mount it for continuous use on battery power).Ultimately, if you have the need for a low-cost video monitoring solution, this product fits the bill."
3,2.4GHz Wireless Surveillance Camera Kit w/4-Channel Wireless,It's just okay. the receiver has to be very close to camera. It runs down the 9V batteries quickly. and in some location the camera will not work.
1,Keep your money,"My 4 year old plays with them they are just his speed. The reception is crappy, one of the lenses just fell out, and they never stay put!"
4,Wireless camera kit w/receiver,Everytime I record activity with the wireless camera system it shuts down my Wi-Fi to my laptop. I would stringly suggest knowing how to change channel frequencies.
5,SOOOO SHARP!!!,THESE ARE SO SHARP.. I BOUGHT FOR MY NIECE'S WEDDING AND I WAS NOT AT ALL SORRY. THEY LOOK BETTER EVEN THEN I COULD AMAGEINE. ORDER YOU WON'T BE SORRY
4,Err,This one has a great plot and plenty of action and humor and you get to meet some of Lupin's family. But unfortunately it contains some nudity and other rated R stuff. PG in Japan is not the same as PG in the US
5,One of the 3 best Lupin movies ever,"This is one of my third favorite Lupin movies. While Castle of Cagliostro is #1 and Dead or Alive is #2.There's is so much happening. It has a lot to do with religious cult called the ""Nostradamus Sect"". Which is an actual religion founded by a man named Micheal Nostradamus who lived in the 16th century.There's a giant skyscrapper called the ""Douglas Media Skyscrapper"" who is own by the billionaire Douglas who is trying to win Presidental election."
1,worst car care video I've ever seen,"I have watched many car care/repair videos. Unfortunately most are a bit outdated so I was excited when a local library got in this recent one.I was appalled to see them jack up a car without sticking something under the wheels to keep the car from rolling. I saw it a bit ago so I can't remember the other stupid things there were- but that was my main impression. I felt the library should pull it from the shelves - as the guys on the dvd weren't doing things safely/intelligently.I really would like to find a recent good video/dvd. My favorite is Last Chance Garage, but it is a bit outdated(I don't know if it has been updated). I wish pbs would bring back that show- the (last chance garage) video is amazing."
5,The Life of Rudolf Nureyev in his Own Words.,"Seated on a rocky shore facing his own island across from Naples, Italy, Rudolf Nureyev narrates the story of his life from the time he was born on a Siberian train passing near Lake Baikal to the small town of Ufa, Russia and on to the ballet school in Leningrad and the Kirov Ballet, his defection in Paris, France and at last worldwide fame. This progress is illustrated with photos and film clips as well as comments from family, friends, teachers and ballet partners. The film ends with his last trip to Russia to visit his dying mother and he bids us farewell as drops into the sea in the nude and swims away."
3,The Shortest Way to discourage....,"This book contains information that is concise and certainly complete. However, for a first-book writer, it is an overwhelming source of discouragement. Right away she tells you how unlikely it is that you will succeed at getting a book published. And, she tells you that it will take up to over four years for ""the shortest way"". This book is realism, I am painfully sure, just not much cheerleading for the first-book writer. I am not going to let it get me down. I am reading only the chapters that are relavent to non-fiction writing in many how-to books on writing. I'm placing this book in the middle of the stack. If this was the first book read by an aspiring writer, I'm afraid it would scare off many good writers. For cheerleading, I read a dose of Dan Poynter, though his books tend to include limited information. Just pick the chapters relevant to your work, and skip what agony COULD, just could befall you."
5,It worked for me!,"In 1997, I was trying to get a book published. I found this book and followed Susan's advice. It's now 2007 and my 7th book comes out this year.Cheryl Charming"
5,A great place to start,"Susan Page's book offers great insight into the ""publisher or self publish"" question that plagues so many first authors. This book is full of helpful information, and very encouraging to aspiring writers. I've recommended it many times."
5,Finally a place to start,"As a struggling writer with no knowledge of the publishing industry or all of the facets that accompany the actual writing of the book, I found Susan Page's book to be exactly what I needed to truly wade through the complicated world of moving from a ""writer"" to a ""published author"".Her advice is timeless and valuable. I don't think I'd have made it past my manuscript, my various poems, and collections of journaling, and actually be on my way to publishing a book of my own without reading The Shortest Distance..."
3,Nothing new,"A look at Miss Page's publishing history reveals three relationship books. This may explain why she tells the writer to approach their book by 1) Establishing Your Book's Unique Identity, 2) Start Working on a Fabulous Title and only then, 3) Write Your Book. This may in fact be a good path for nonfiction, but they have little to do with helping a fiction writer get published. She spends a considerable amount of time on writing and post-publication, when the title promises to talk about getting to publication. If you need to know to write a book first and care about getting your book into paperback after its successful run in hard cover, or want some cheerleading, buy it. If you want insider knowledge and concrete, proven examples and insight, move on."
5,I like an Author that Practices What She Preaches,"With this book, Susan Page provides anecdotal advice for writers and would-be-writers everywhere. I especially paid attention after I looked at some of her on-order numbers for one of her new book as listed in Baker &amp; Taylor. She has a brave tell-it-as-it-is style and manages to keep the reader interested. This is an encouraging and useful book. Outside of Rosemary Daniell's new book, this is my second favorite writing guide of 1997. - Steven Farme"
2,"Writing a book, or Marketing 101?","There's no doubt that there's some good information here, but I was a little overtaken by the 'businesslike' manner she portrays. It works for self-help relationship books like her's. But it seems somehow sacreligious for any kind of literary writing. If I were looking to write for the money it brought in (as compared to writing for the discovery, joy, uncontrollable need) this would probably be a great book. For me, it's somewhat interesting and mildly depressing."
2,ok i guess,"This book was Ok, but as far as it being a step-by-step approach it wasnt so great. I didnt see many unique ideas and the step by step approach was ambiguous. Just about all of the information I got out of this book I recieved through a simple internet search. If you are looking for a hold your hand approach to publishing, I would look elsewhere"
5,Great labor history....,"This history of a small, but influential transport union is the best work of its kind. It serves as a model for others to follow in making a critical judgement of the rise of transportation unionism, municipal unions and New York City organized labor"
3,Not as good as some of her other books,"I thought 'Corpse Suzette' was okay, but not as good as some of her other books. It started out slow & built to a so/so ending. Just mediocre."
4,An interesting read,I enjoyed reading the book. I must say that I tend to agree with the author that the race for improved equipment is ruining the sport. I read that and say that but still enjoy seeing some drive a 330 yard par 4. He right about older courses becoming less of a challenge.
3,outdated,"It is outdated to where a majority of the information is not relevant. Weapons and equipment technologies have advanced enormously, the political landscape is vastly different, tactics have evolved, strategy has changed. It is all pre-OEF and OIF footage."
4,Just what I wanted after my trip,"I don't know about the reviewers who said that you will never forget the people in this book. Still, this book was just what I wanted after my 2-week trip - interesting vignettes from someone who truly experienced Costa Rica.You should know that most of the stories occured at least a decade or more ago, in case that matters to you. Also, there wasn't much about Costa Rican wildlife."
2,Not much value added in this book,"I'm not an academic, but I thought the Psalms of the Bible were already poetry. I didn't read one psalm that sounded better than the original, in this book. I threw the book away."
1,Avoid this,"The styling of this scale is nice but most buy a scale for its functionality not its form. This scale would never read the same twice. It was overly sensitive to the point of not reading a steady weight unless you were absolutely still while it took a reading. I apparently could not stand still long enough for it to ""lock in"". My wife had the same difficultly. I would avoid this scale."
2,different readings,My wife and I both use this scale. Each of us can stand on it three times each and we can get three different readings. We are going back to our scale which is about 13 years old.
1,Lemon?,"I purchased this scale in November and have had to replace the batteries twice already. The packaging claims an extra long battery life. I've found that weighing myself once a day, the batteries only lasted about 3 weeks. I'm hoping I just got a lemon."
5,EBM is the best!,This release combine dense electronic with distorted ryhtms and great vocals!Don't miss this CD!
2,Not accurately described,"The product condition was listed as acceptable, however, the cover and first several pages of the book were missing! Very disappointed."
4,BETTER THAN THE MOVIE,"I tried this game out before buying it for my niece. Actually, the game is more entertaining than the actual movie upon which it is based. The graphics and animation were better than what we got in the movie. The locations from the movie were used in the game and gave the player an opportunity to explore and make points. Reminds me a lot of Pac-man and the old Super Mario Brothers. Fun for kids but tedious for adults. Maybe a bit overpriced for a movie tie-in."
4,Very Fun,I am a 10 year old writting from Guatemala. I bought this game after playing it with a neighbor. I think this game is very fun. It is not so hard as I already got to the end. I highly recommend this game for middle stage players.
1,Warning - This is a different (and inferior) game.,"I enjoyed the PC version of the game. So, I bought this game so I could play on my PS2.Same title, same box art = same game , right? Wrong! This is a totally different and inferior game. They just use the the title and box art from the PC version to cheat you out of your money.Beware, THQ and Spongebob use deceptive advertising.Be sure to borrow or rent a copy to see if you like it, first."
2,An Awesome Game For Kids!!,This game is great...If your 13 or younger. I despies older people watching and enjoying spongebob as if he were some God. Wearing shirts and boxers of him gloating about how they watched the show the day before. It is a time to put an end to this misery over this terrible creature. Nevertheless the game is great!!. Graphics gameplay....Hell a kid won't know the difference but its good for them. Unfortunally the humor in the game is just as warped and subliminal as in the show and the movie though for kids it is alright. The overall apperance of the game is great and is certainly easy to play except for a few tough levels in which you can easily help your child through. If you catch any adult near this game officialy declare them an outcast and stay away from them at all costs. This game is awesome only if your 13 or younger!!
4,Cool Game,"This game is good my kids like it, they just can't get past a certain level, my wife and I both try to beat the level for them and can't LOL But over all it's a good game. My wife and I just aren't game players, my kids will figure it out sooner or later."
4,Fun enough game,"I am a HUGE Spongebob fan, so this game was basically a must-buy for me. After receiving it and started playing it, I was somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong - it's a fun game, especially for anyone who's a Spongebob fan - but the graphics aren't all that great. At times, it was hard to tell where I was going or what I was jumping on. I guess you can't ask too much of it since it's a game geared for children."
4,Good... but challenging,"I love spongebob and have played Battle ofr Bikini Bottom. This one is very difficult. But, I'm in for a challenge. For those of you that like challenges, this is for you."
4,Speaks to all levels.,"I am a former athlete that my 20s and 30s that got the best of me. Now 50 pounds heavier, with high blood pressure and lower engery levels I want to make a change. What I liked best was how this book was an easy read the first night read over 50 pages. The key fundemental that was repeated was get up and do something constintantly even if its taking a walk for 15 minutes for 3 times a week and then increase steadily. This book also gives people a little embrassed about getting back to the gym."
3,Needs an attitude adjustment,"Frankly, I didn't get past the introduction. The basic gist was that if you're over 40, you're on that slippery slope into the Dark Abyss and the only reason to get fit is to hold off the Grim Reaper a little longer. Other books for aging Baby Boomres are much more positive about the possibilities for an excellent quality of life, such as ""Walking and Running for Women over 40."""
5,Super PCI Card but only for Windows 98 or 95,"This is great card but it will not play good in Windows XP or 2000.So beware, if you run windows 9X , you will love this card.If u have old PC like me that missinng AGP slot this card is great, games play good picture is amazinng quality, TV tuner and so on.For windows 98 this card is worth every penny!"
4,Not bad for 90s technology,"I bought this card for an old Dell mini-desktop that I turned into a cheap digital VCR. The card installed with no problems, the software is easy to use, and it actually syncs audio and video better than a newer AIW AGP card that I was using in a different machine. It works good with Windows XP, and if I wanted to search for the old Windows 98 drivers for the rest of the hardware on this machine, it could probably run even better. I'm really impressed, considering I never expected to downgrade to PCI video."
2,Painful!,"There is nothing practical about this book. It is a looooong, purely theoretical torture with only a few examples that don't work too well in the real world. I had to buy it for one of my graduate classes and here I am three months later even more clueless than I was when I started. This book is very boring, painful to read. It doesn't help that the author is clearly biased in favor of traditional HRM and refuses to give much room to more modern thinking. The exercise book is a nightmare. The exercises are either impossibly difficult and time-consuming because the textbook does not offer valuable guidance for any practical problems, or they are an absolute waste of time - students basically have to copy a chapter. I could go on like this forever. In a nutshell: buy this book if you have to, but sell it as soon as you can."
3,"Outdated but - As Yet, Nothing Better","I assign this as one of two textbooks in teaching Compensation Administration in graduate school.While it has undergone 9 revisions, the attempts to update it to today's compensation world are not adequate. Far too little is here concerning internet usage, for example.But perhaps its greatest shortcoming is in its glancing treatment of group incentive plans as a key means to unlock workforce potential. It is a glaring and unforgivable gap.If anybody out there knows of a better fundamental compensation textbook, I'd love to hear about it."
3,"A good text book, but a text book all the same.","This book is well written, informative & exceptionally boring. Richard Henderson, a compensation master, is superfluously long in the tooth. This book will get you an A & put you to sleep."
2,"Terrible, from a student perspective.","I thought this class would be one of my favorites, but the textbook saw to it that it would not live up to this expectation. The book is technical and boring. There isn't any anecdotal information (which I find very helpful for moving a student through the chapters). I don't know if there is a better choice out there, but if there is, teachers should make it."
5,My review of this album was published in 1985,"My review of ""White Shoes"" ran in the June 1985 issue of CD REVIEW magazine. The music is great and the fidelity is exceptional. Great band, songs, production. It's probably Harris's most rocking album."
3,Good,"I love Emmylou Harris, and this was a hard one to find.On the whole, I guess I would recommend this, but for the import price, I would only recommend this to her most loyal fans. There are only two things you need on this, ""Drivin' Wheel,"" and ""In My Dreams"" (which is available in the box set, Portraits).It sounds here like Emmylou was running out of ideas. Some of the songs will knock you right down, and then some will make you say, ""Here we go again. Yippee."""
5,"Very challenging, opinionated, with a lingering effect.","I have given copies to several friends and find this a book that I want to discuss with them. It is rather academic at times, but by the time he gets to the interpretation of Scripture he starts to soar. Ideas from this book have continually returned to enlighten and offer insight months after I read it."
3,"Leave a little myth, please","I will say first of all that this book is a very interesting read; Bailie wears his ideology on his sleeve, not pretending any kind of ""objectivity."" And for the most part, I agree with him. However, there were a couple problems that I had with the book.Bailie, while well-intentioned, eventually strips biblical narratives of all the personhood of God. The portrayals of YHWH he does not like he chalks up to ""violent myth,"" and the ones he does he calls ""religious genius."" Moreover, up to the point that I am in the book (about sixty pages to go), he has not yet allowed any miraculous event to stand miraculous; he wants to ""demythologize"" them all into social interactions. While he does not have to give them historical veracity, at least he could talk about what the miraculous as miraculous might mean."
5,Essential for understanding social violence,"As we head into the post industrial Dark Age, brought on by global warming, climate change and the end of the oil age, it is important that we understand the nature of the violence that pushes us to the brink of extinction in a nuclear armed world that is still poised on hair-trigger alert, with the spread and upgrading of weapons of mass destruction, that are illegal according to the world court.This book is excellent at uncovering the deeper roots of our violence. An important cvontribution to the subject."
5,#1 in parenting magzine,This game is fun and you can see why parenting magzine rated it the number 1 software of the year. i like to play it with my dad. this game is really fun because you fight tak's nightmare monsters. this game has a lot of action.
1,Too Complicated!,"I have this game on a demo disc and it's pretty cool, for the first five minutes! Although my mom likes it, this game lacks direction and the controls are too complicated! Plus, it's not my kind of game and I was going too buy it. I definitly recomend to rent it first."
2,Demo pretty weak,"Played the first one and thought it was okay. I recently played the demo that was packed in with OPM magazine. It was pretty dismal. The game play is slow, the camera is nausiating and overall the game is just slow and no fun. I think I liked the first one better than this one."
3,I DONT CARE,My boys love it they say they could rate the game ovewrall better had they finished it already....otherwise they like it!
1,Disappointed!,"We have been playing Tak 2 and have been very disappointed in the product. The game play is slow and not that fun. We like the Nickelodian games in general, Sponge Bob, but this one not so much. You might want to rent before you buy."
2,Fair not great,"Our family owns the first Tak and while I don't think this game is bad, it just seems a bit too similar to the first game and still has many of the same problems. The collect-fest of the game is still as annoying as it was in the first game also the camera works very poorly. The characters and graphics look better, the worlds are larger and there are some decent puzzle aspects - but it just still feels a bit slow and monotnous."
3,Not easy for normal humans,"Please don't listen to the opinions of hardcore gamers who say this game is ""easy"" and ""only for toddlers"". It may be easy for those who spend 18 hours a day playing video games, but for the ""rest of us"" it's a challenging game. The barrel ride through raging waters and over waterfalls is particularly difficult and dare I say, very frustrating. I sincerely hope your family members don't find this easy, because if they do then they are playing video games far too much.To the gamers: get a life. To normal people: only get this game if you have a high tolerance for frustration and a strong stomach for disorienting visual images."
5,Unersappreciated,"Yes, this is one of the last of the MGM musicals. Tis a pity. Now that CHICAGO is such a hit, they must release other MGM musicals just as good as this. THE BAND WAGON...THREE LITTLE WORDS...EASTER PARADE and SUMMER STOCK, just to name a few. SILK STOCKINGS is a remarkablly good film for it's genre. Nothing could beat CYD and FRED dancing, even if the plot isn't strong. Too bad there wasn't more of JANIS PAGE as one of her numbers seems to have been given the short shift. Otherwise, the film is a standout and a must for musical lovers. Any left? I think so. Give this one a try as well as the other Cole Porter releases. Thanks for these, but we want more!!!"
5,Enjoyable light entertainment.,"Although I've seen better dancing by Astaire and Charisse, and it is not Cole Porters best music, the songs and comedy make it a very enjoyable movie."
2,Silk Stockings,Fred and Cyd were never singers or actors; they should have stuck to what they knew best....dancing! Cole Porter was not at his peak when he wrote the score for this amateurish box office failure. And those accents!
2,Great Film - Poor Quality Master!,Received this great musical on DVD the other day to enhance my collection and was disappointed to find the picture quality substantially inferior to my identical television recording and only a slight improvement upon an old video tape of the same film. Digital enhancement would appear to be needed in this particular case.
4,"Softspots Angie, Taupe","I love these loafers, especially the Velcro closure. They are a great fit all the way around. The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because the upper is coming loose from the sole on the right shoe. Think I can fix it with some Superglue, but should not have to for an $80 shoe. This happened after one wearing, but have not had the problem on the black pair of the same style. Even with this small problem, I would buy these again."
4,IMPORTANT MEMOIR FOR NEUTRALIZING HOLOCAUST DENIAL,"In his autobiography, Rudolf Hoess openly writes that he was personally responsible for the gassing murder of 2-1/2 million Jews at Auschwitz-Birkenau. He wrote the memoir just before his execution for crimes against humanity to save his family from consequences of his actions. Hoess took full responsibility for his crimes. It was a mea culpa -- complete with elaborate tables with a breakdown of which country various populations of his victims had come from.Hoess concludes his memoir explaining that he wrote it so the world could see that he wasn't a monster -- rather, just a misled bureaucrat who hopes his family will not be made to suffer for his crimes. The book is well worth reading -- especially by those who either out of ignorance or wickedness take the position that the Holocaust never happened.See: ""Pope, Expressing Solidarity With Jews, Reacts to Uproar Over a Holocaust Denier"" -- New York Times[...]"
4,"Nicely recorded, but lacklustre performances","The technical recording of this CD is ok. Good soundstage and range. Not superior, but ok. It is a DDD recording, and the CD appears ""GOLD"". I waited six weeks for this CD, but it was NOT worth the wait. The performance is lacklustre and mechanical. Nothing special about it. If I had heard it before I bought it I would NOT have purchased it. But it is nice for background music, very pleasant.The out of print Archive recording with the English Concert with the Sextet in C major and OP.22 and OP.11 quintets puts this recording to shame, technical wise, and performance wise.If you are looking for a JCF Bach CD that would be ""similar"", but to me much nicer, is the available (on Amazon.com) DYNAMIC label recording of the JCF Bach Flute Quartets, by Concilium Musicum."
4,Great DVD,"This is a great DVD full of useful information for an aspiring Bartender.I bought this because I wanted to start a career in the bartending profession. It has a lot of good information and enjoyable to watch. Good quality production. If you are trying to become a bartender or know someone that is , This is a good buy."
2,Quality of product,"The 44 kitchen cabinet pulls I purchased on Amazon did not match the quality of the same pull I bought at WalMart. The white porcelain bead fit very snugly and neat on the back side of the pull on the WalMart pull. None I purchased on line looked that nice. I suspect the ones on line to be seconds. Of course, I paid $.76 less a piece for the ones on line. Silly me I thought I was getting a bargain."
3,Introduction to Opera-eze,"This book is a typical Scooby story. It really doesn't make much sense, but it does give a child a backstage look at the opera and for that it is at least worthy of three stars."
3,Thoughtful from another perspective,This written account of time spent in Auschwitz during WWII. Very few books are written from the view of a person who was in a camp working with German scientists that experimented on prisoners.
4,Goodbook,Good book. Worked less than a year for the ss and doctor mengele but had many things to tell us.
4,Great book,"Detailed account of a very difficult subject. Watch the movie ""The Grey Zone"" which tracks the book very well if you enjoyed the book."
4,Behind the scenes in a concentration camp,"I've read several holocaust stories, some are from people in hiding, some in concentration camps, but this book was interesting from a different prospective. He was a jewish doctor who was forced to do autopsies and disections on dead bodies. He worked directly under the infamous mad and cruel Dr. Mengele. He was treated better than the other prisoners, provided with good clothing and food. He provides a lot of information about things that went on behind the scenes. A book not for the weak. Although I thought that the Foreword and Introduction chapters were long and boring, the remainder of the book was very informative. Even though these holocaust books are difficult to read, this is part of history and must be told."
4,A difficult read due to the subject matter but well written.,"I could never say I ""Loved"" this book- the subject isn't loveable. But the story of people caught up in that situation need a voice so we can try to prevent this from ever happening again."
4,INHUMANITY,The books reads like watching a horror movie. I particularly enjoyer resding the forword by Bruno Bettelheim who raises a very profound question. Excellent read for people with solid stomachs!
4,A harrowing read,A fascinating read on the horrors of Auschwitz seen from the eyes of a Jewish doctor. The author of this book was put in charge by Dr. Mengales of dissections of countless victims of the holocaust all in the name of unlocking the secrets to racial purity. I have read numerous books on this topic and always find it a harrowing and sobering topic but never has a book shown it in such a way.
5,emotionally provoking,"Am not sure that I saw what the author was trying to convey. What could possibly be worse,the extermination of millions of Jews or this physican's participation in these acts. The fact that he was an active participant was not an act of bravery or a means to survive,but an act of disregard for his fellow man. How could he face himself in the mirror everyday after watching hundreds of thousands of people meet their death and he simply stood by! How could he save a young girl from the gas chamber,administer medical care and then turn her over to the SS for death?Did I feel sorry for him,not in the least. This book kept me awake at night pondering what would I have done if I was the doctor?"
5,A serious hard-to-read book,"This book basically shows what would happen if the inmates ran the asylum. It reads like fiction, but it is a real trip to hell. The doctor is a fine writer and captures every sordid detail. It is a hard book to read, but I am sure it was harder to write. A must read for all Holocaust deniers!"
5,A horrifying and fascinating account.,"This was an early work on the life of an Auschwitz prisoner working as a forensic physician attached to a crematorium. The book is not, as some have suggested, simply another retelling of death camp terrors. It is also the fascinating story of Miklos Nyiszli, a professional scientist who is very proud of his skills. Forced to apply them under the most unspeakable conditions, he carries on - pleased with his new laboratory, his relationship with respected German institutes of race theory and eugenics (as a supplier of gruesome specimens), and eager not just to survive, but to be recognized for his talents by Mengele who was the Camp's chief scientific officer. He recognizes the horror of his position and the tenuous nature of his very existence. He loathes the gas and is in no way a collaborator - yet he takes pride in his technical accomplishments. As a fellow scientist, I am repelled, I am horrified, and I understand"
4,Haunting,I first read this book when I was twelve years old. It was the very first book I read about the Holocaust. It seared itself into my memory. How could this happen? How could this kind of evil exist? I can't recommend a stronger testament to the horror of that time and place.
3,Interesting peek into Auschwitz,This story is truly concentration camps from a different perspective. Good for anyone into twisted medical minds. I liked it just fine even though I know nothing about medicine.
3,Quick Read,"I haven't read many books about the Holocaust and I chose this one because I thought it would be interesting to read about the experience of a doctor who worked alongside the notorious Dr. Mengele. The author wrote both vaguely and in great description at different points in the book. Overall, the book was a quick read, and definitly worth it. Maybe I expected more of a sentimental side from the doctor... but I guess that experience hardens people."
4,ww2,Enjoy reading up on anything ww2 escecialy the Holocost. To read about the trials & trbulations form a person who lived it was moving.
5,Powerful and unforgettable,"There can never be a path to understanding the Holocaust because all human explorations are bound to fail. However, the inferno that was called Auschwitz must never be forgotten. This book is haunting,painful but an absolute must read for anyone committed to it never happening again.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"
5,Great read!,I though this was a wonderfully enlightening novel but not for the faint of heart. It was rather shocking with the details that were added but I think that is what makes it so appealing...he told it as he saw it. I think everyone should read this book because it's an easy read and very accurately depicts one aspect of the Holocaust.
3,Avoid the foreword,"I highly recommend skipping the foreword to this book. It is complete psychological hot air by a self-absorbed intellectual that ads absolutely nothing to the reading value of the book.Equally useless is the introduction, which simply quotes passages from the foreword that precedes it and the book that follows it.Spare yourself the superfluous opinions of both irrelevant men, and get right to the core of the matter by reading only that written by the real author.The rest of the book, as many others have mentioned, is an excellent account of the Auschwitz experience."
4,Short and to the point,"Disturbing, but that's exactly what it should be. It amazes me that there are still people who deny it happened. I don't know how to respond to the 2 guys who gave 1 star with identical reviews. I'd like to see your research on the doctor. To the other person who gave 1 star-what did you think you would be reading about when you chose a book about Auschwitz?? Sunshine and roses? Yes life goes on, and it has, and the survivors got past the horrors somehow.I found this to be a good read."
4,chronicle of courage!,"Rare and precious account of man kinds darkest hour, told through first hand experience of a man who survived insurmountable odds in order to fulfill his destiny: to give us his story."
4,Auschwitz. A painfull read.,"This book gives one a lot of extra information about the internal workings of the camps. Its a hard read, but for those seeking the truth, accurate information and the hope for survival do not miss it."
3,apology for collaboration?,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this book was spookily distant. I'm not sure if I may have had some preconceived notion, but it seemed to me that Dr Nyiszli's infrequent references to the suffering of the general population of the camp were pro forma, inserted when he ""remembered"" to be horrified. He failed to mention even his own wife and daughter for what I thought was an unusually long stretch, and gave more attention to the quality of clothes he was issued and his personal discomfort. I've read many accounts of Holocaust survivors and camp liberators, and this book just seemed to be missing the true sense of horror expressed by witnesses.Anyone else feel this way?"
4,Auschwitz,Excellent book for those who loves history. the book takes you back to how it must have been surviving the camps. One must though keep in mind the winner always writes the history.
3,Insiders account of horror,"When I ordered this, I was expecting a detailed account of what happened during the authors confinement in Auschwitz. I was not too disappointed. The only thing that disappoints me is that there are no diagrams or drawings to support the story. Also no comments as to what happened to the SS, who were mentioned, after the war. But maybe that is for someone else to write about. The book is too short, and I am sure that more information could have been included. The price is about right for what you get."
4,Horrifying look into the Holocaust,"This book was very good. The main character did what he could to be able to tell the story to future generations in order to prevent this from ever happening again, and also to survive. Nyiszli, should have died a dozen times in this book, but each time he escaped death. Of the thousands-He may have been the luckiest Auschwitz prisoner to survive. We must continue to read books like this, because as horrifying as they are, they teach us to never forget; for as soon as you forget there is chance that it could happen again."
2,Aushcwitz,Book is just a repetition of the first chapter. Not sure what I was expecting but its just too long for what it entailed.
4,Incomprehensible,"For Dr. Nyiszli to bear witness to the day-in and day-out horror of Auschwitz, and still be able to write about it, is quite unreal. Working as a pathologist for Dr. Mengele in the confines of the crematorium compound, we read of the horrors of the camp, and how both inmates & guards coped."
4,disturbing and brutally honest,"This book is hard to put down. It really makes you wonder how man can sink to the lowest level by treating his fellow man this way.The atrocities committed by the nazis on these defenceless souls is only compounded by their lies and deception to the unfortunate victims and indeed the outside world .It was a never ending horror story with the worst imaginable crimes committed . No horror fiction writer can come close to this...... and yet it is a irrefutably true story,"
5,Excellent,"Heartbreaking tale, beautifully written. This story is one that not only touched me but broke my heart into pieces. Excellent."
4,Auschwitz,A disturbing count of a physician who was forced to perform unspeakable things at one Germany's Concentration camps. A well written book.
2,Impossible to like !,"The word ""auschwitz"" automatically causes revulsion, this book only added to that feeling.If it was intended to excuse the writers actions, it did not."
4,A different view from other Auschwitz books.,"I enjoyed this book because it took me to a different place within the camp. Most books tell about their struggle for life within the barracks of the camp. Escaping selection, and struggling with awful illnesses. This books is told by a Jew doctor. He was selected on day one to be part of a sonnderkommndo group. He lived his days inside one of the many crematoriums. What he witnessed throughout his time in Auschwitz, is truely one of a kind. Most others that were witness to this side of the camp, were routinely exacuted."
2,Poor Quality,"It was a trully low budget CD. I got it mainly for one song, but I paid really cheap for it, so I got my moneys worth."
5,highly informative book on one of Sweden's greatest holidays,"this book is absolutely amazing. it gives in detail and easy to follow instructions the how to's of the Saint Lucia celebration in Sweden. i especially like hearing about the origin of the Saint and why Sweden has honored her for so long. another bonus of this incredible book is the recipe's at the end. it is a sweet surprise indeed! the author gives step by step instructions on how to prepare your own Lucia celebration, and tips to help it be fun and beautiful. and for those of us with swedish heritage it is especially nice to find Lucia songs in english AND swedish. all in all a wonderful read."
2,"Don't buy this card, buy ALL IN WONDER 7500 Same price","This is old video card, Rodeon AIW 7500 cost even lessAnd is 10x better than this.This card has slow memory for games, and not good drivers for Windows XP"
1,"A coffee table book, or a strategy guide?","This is a horrible 'book'. I apply that term with much regret, because books contain words, strung together in sentences in order to express thought. This contains pictures of the game with a caption such as 'new train', following a single sentence informing the reader that at a certain point in the scenario, they will indeed be offered a new train. Sentences are repeated often; peppered throughout the scenarios section are such insights as 'expand quickly', and 'issue a bond'. The 'author' had 206 pages to fill, and succeeded with minimal effort. He likely played each scenario once, and makes no effort to explain the new economy. The industry chart contains less information than the poster shipped with the game. Overall, there is better documentation in the box."
1,Railroad Tycoon 3 Official Strategy Guide,"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVERThis is a horrible 'book'. I apply that term with much regret, because books contain words, strung together in sentences in order to express thought. This contains pictures of the game with a caption such as 'new train', following a single sentence informing the reader that at a certain point in the scenario, they will indeed be offered a new train. Sentences are repeated often; peppered throughout the scenarios section are such insights as 'expand quickly', and 'issue a bond'. The 'author' had 206 pages to fill, and succeeded with minimal effort. He likely played each scenario once, and makes no effort to explain the new economy. The industry chart contains less information than the poster shipped with the game. Overall, there is better documentation in the box.This book contains nothing of any value for the serious railroad developer. Virtually nothing on the economy, cargo or advanced play issues. Don't waste your money."
3,Was hoping this would have more.,"I was hoping this book would reveal the deep secrets of the games's economy and talk more about overarching strategy. It wastes a LOT of page space just talking about the basics, with HUGE and useless screenshots peppered throughout. It has a decent walkthrough of the campaign, but if you're looking for a tell-all book on what makes this game tick, this doesn't quite cut it."
4,Theophostic Counseling: Divine Revelation,"Although this book is extreme, its exposure of the fallacies in Theophostic counseling is accurate. Ed Smith's proof-texting takes Bible verses out of context and uses them to forward his adgenda. If you are struggling, pick up a Bible and read what Jesus has to say about it."
1,From one who has experienced theophostics,"I know the Word (I have most of the NT memorized) and I know theophostics. My wife has met the Jesus of the NT in theophostic sessions while her counselor writes verbatum notes of their conversations. When I compare the two, the session notes might as well be another chapter in the gospels. The Jesus she meets has all the wisdom, grace, kindness, playfulness, and powerful teaching that he displayed in the scriptures. And she is healed of wounds that 10 years of Prozac and Minerth-Meier counselor sessions could not relieve. So don't bother with inexperienced reviews; get Ed Smith's tapes and start experiencing the Biblical Jesus yourself."
4,Short version of a UD football game in 2003,"As a Blue Hen parent, I wanted to get a copy of the games I had on video put on the computer so I could make a highlight tape of my sons college career. Unfortunately, ESPN had published two of the games as CDs so I was not able to get my video copy digitized commercially. This version sold by Amazon is only the game and does not even show the goal post being pulled down after the game. Nevertheless, my husband and I enjoyed watching it and many fond memories."
1,Bad design,"The picture of this chime looked adorable so I ordered it. When the product arrived, it was all tangled, the beads were falling off, part of the wind chime itself was broken, and a metal shaving went right into my hand! There was no possible way to untangle the mess. I notified amazon and sent it back requesting a full refund. This is not worth the money it is being advertised for, and it is purely decorative. You could not hang these outdoors, it is far to flimsey."
1,Windchime - Pots & pans,"The picture looks better than the actual wind chime. It came broken, one of the strings broke, it looks like they packaged it broken because the beads were missing. I woun't order this item or from this company. It tooks a week to ship, the it arrived broken."
5,Great Content,"Yes, this is a textbook, but well written, and full of great info, easy to read. A little cheezy in spots, but the world would be a better place if people understood and applied the concepts in this book."
5,Very Informative!!!,This book on interpersonal communication opens your mind to several concepts not covered in a regular communication course. This book relates to our lives.
1,DISAPPPOINTED,"I am not very happy, because Iordered this Book on Nov 22 and still have not received it. I may have to cancel my order!"
2,review,book was okay but I had the wrong edition. always make sure when looking for books that you choose the right edition unless you still live in the 70's or something then this is the book for you.
3,But is it worth the price?,"This may be a good text for the subject but is outrageously priced at over $68. Even considering that textbooks are always overpriced, this book shouldn't cost more than $40."
1,Movie Star is the only track I know.,Not much to say other than the one hit wonder sadly means the chaff comes with it. Is this song worth the cost of the full CD? On the right night after a few beers with the right company --- probably yes.
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"Overall this book is now a definet favorite of mine. I thought this book was a hard book to put down and i enjoyed how it kept you on the edge of your seat,I would recommend this book to children or adults 13 years of age or older. In this story a young teenage girl by the name Janie has just discovred she is a missing child and wanted by the FBI and Police. She starts getting suspecious on who kidnapped her because her kind loving parents seem just to nice to do anything like that. Her only friend there to help on her journey to sloving this mystery is her nextdoor neighbor Reeve. Now she is on a search for her real family and all of the details on her kidnapping. Does Janie find her real family? Does she find out who the kidnapper was? Read this exciting book to find out and you won't regret it."
4,The Face on the Orange Juice Carton,"I found this book's emotions to be nothing but the bare truth of a tipical teenager's life. At some point in time, everyone goes through that emotional stage,although not always in that same situation. I felt that the story was ended well, because it helped intriugue the reader to follow up on the other books in the series to find out what happeded. I, meself,found it hard not to read all night because of how anxious I was to know what would happen to Janie/Jennie. All in all, The Face on the Milk Carton was an okay book."
1,Half of a book at best....,"This ""book"" was actually more like the first few chapters of a book. A bit of a rip off really because you expect a plot to have a beginning (Janie realizes she's kidnapped) middle (discovery of her other family, conflict, adjustment, etc.) and end (resolution.) Instead, you get to the end of the book and realize you have only read the first few chapters of the beginning of the actual story. In order to read the rest of it, you have to buy additional books. The plot has potential to be a really good book. Breaking it up so strangely really makes it seem like a ploy to get you to buy all the books once you are hooked on the story. Which I certainly won't be doing."
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"The Face on the Milk Carton is a thrilling book that made me realize just how precious common sense isto have and use. It taught me to be careful around strangers. Carolin B. Cooney did a great job making an intense book with a good message. I would rate this book a four out of five because it had a positive message which stuck through the whole book.And the ending kept me guessing which i like and in the middle of te book the story got confusing, but it was made up by the ending. Anyone who enjoys a book that keeps them guessing, thrillers, mysteries, romantic, and adventurous stories, this book is for you! THis book starts off strong and ends strong."
5,VERY addicting! I just couldn't put it down!,"I am a 14 year old who read all the books in this series. I ABSOLUTELY loved them. Once I started the first book in the sereies (""The Face On The Milk Carton"") I couldn't put it down. It was just very VERY addicting. At the end of the book it left me in suspense so i just HAD to read the other books in the series. I really really enjoyed reading them too. But don't forget, if you read this book you will want to read the other two (three including the conclusion book ""What Jane Found""). That pretty much takes away the suspense. I think that Caroline B. Cooney is a great author. I read 2 of her other books and I just couldn't put them down either."
4,Intresting?,"I thought this book was GREAT the only problem was that they kept getting off the subject they were trying to explain, then all of a sudden 25 pages later they get back on it again! But in other words the book was a total sucsess! The ending was a little disapointing!"
3,The face on the milk carton,"I recently read Caroline B.Cooney's The Face on the Milk Carton. The book began to be interesting when Janie found out that she was kidnapped, but I felt as the story got near the end it didn't quite conclude the way stories written by her usually conlude. From reading her other books, I anticipated that this one would be as interesting as the others, maybe with more information about what happened to Janie after she talked to her mother, or it would have ended differently. A more mysterious ending could have been added to the story to leave the reader with a thought."
5,I read this book because I couldn't put it down !!!!!1,"I read this book because I could't put it down, all the kids in my school where reading it, it was on my Accelrated Reader list and I love the authors writeing. First I read the 3rd book weird haha becuase I say the Face On the Milk Carton movie on lifetime but the 3rd book is different then the movie because the movie has all 3 books rold all into one for the movie. I read for about 3 hours today just trying to find out what happens and I can't wait to read the 2nd book. I love the story of Janie and Reeve hope you do to.thanks, me."
4,This book was so suprising!,"I really liked this book. It never got dull and it was suspenceful until the end. Although it was a kiddnapping mystery, Caroline B. Cooney made it very realistic. I'd reccomend this book to anyone!"
3,too emotional!,"""Face on the Milk Carton"" was a good book, but the author got off topic too much. For example, she would go from wondering what her real parents are like to wondering what making love to reeve would be like. I think this would be a five star book if the author stayed on the stolen child topic."
2,Pretty much a waste of time.,"This book was pretty disappointing. It seemed that the author took an unusual (for ya literature, perhaps not TV movies) subject and plugged in very typical, not particularly likable characters. The relationship between Janie and Reeve seemed thrown in purely to have a romantic/sexy aspect, and didn't seem natural or necessary to the plot. The main issue of the book wasn't really dealt with enough, it was like a distraction the character not only didn't want to think about, but hardly had to till the next book readers who actually cared would have to buy."
2,Parents-preview this book!,"My daughter (12) asked to get this book. Our library lists it as High School rating, so I thought I'd better peek through it first. There is two pages and about two paragraphs that aren't pertinent to the story but totally change the rating! Let's just say the 14 year old character (she finds out she's not 15 like she thought) goes from one kiss with her first boyfriend to a very mature decision the next day...HOPEFULLY this is not a common trait among real teenagers, and certainly something no high school kid should be doing! Also, my daughter enjoys action packed suspense novels; this is neither."
4,This Book Is Awsem,"Hi, my name is Shane Abbott and i thought this book was great. It is full of Love and Adventure. It has bestfriends sharing their life and even boyfriends are in this book. Some of the main charecters are Jannie, Sara-Charollet, Adair and dont forget Revee Shields. If I were you i would get this book as soon as possible!!!"
4,good book,this book is a very good book. It keeps you hooked on the book so you cant let go! It is full of wierd and sometimes sad parts. It would be a very good idea to read this!!
5,The Face On The Milk Carton,"The Face on the Milk Carton is a great book written by Caroline Cooney. It is about a girl who has a happy, rich life and then as she gets older she's at school and discovers a milk carton with her face on it. The book is about her trying to find out what happened to her happy, beautiful life. I recommend this book for people who love to read mystery and are ages 12-any age."
4,Only the First Part of the Puzzle,"Magnetizing! You can not put this book down until the last page is turned. ""The Face on the Milk Carton"" is about the epic troubles of a teenage girl who thinks that she is dreaming up another childhood inside of her. But is this ""dream"" real? Has she really had different parents and a whole other life before? Everyone is telling her that she has this cooped up in her mind and needs to release it. It is only a thought, a figment of her imagination. She has loving parents and she would not trade them for anything, but why does she want to further investigate this troublesom thought? Does her heart know it is real? This horrible daymare continues making her go insane. Does she ever find the truth? You will be on your toes until the end. But even after that, is it enough? Is that all you need to know? Or do you need to read the sequel and find out,""Whatever Happened to Janie?""."
4,One of the best books I have read!!!!!!,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read!!!! I am not a real big reader but I couldnt put this book down!! In five days I was finished with the entire book. This book is filled with mystery and had me wondering every second. This book is about a girl that saw her face on a milk carton. She believes that she was kidnaped but cant tell anyone,well except her boyfriend Reeve. This leads her to a little adventure to New Jersey.She finds out the truth about her life......and this leads us to the next book ""what happened to janie?"""
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"The Face on the Milk Carton was a good book. I can say that it mostly kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to read more. I usually don't read mystery books, but this one was very interesting. Within 5 min. of reading this book, I just could not put it down. The reason why I say this is a good book, and not a very good book is because, yes I did very well like the book but it had some parts where I felt as if Janie was asking a lot of questions and in my opinion she was sort of freaking out to much. So it made her sound really annoying in the book. Anyway if you are the kind of person who does't really like mystery, I suggest that you pick this book up and I guarantee you won't put it down."
2,Face on the MIlk Carton,"The book, Face on the Milk Carton, was not very well written and it could have been much better. I thought it was bad because of all the romance stuff. if the author left that out i would have thought the book was okay. I also thought that the author could have been allot more descriptive. I had a very hard time picturing what was happening. This book was very suspenseful, which helped me to actually finish the book."
2,Not for Elementary School Book Orders,"I purchased this book from my child's 5th grade book order. It was marked ""Mature Theme"". For parents considering this book they should know that there are quite a few sexual references. For example, the teenagers in the book call a place named the Scenic Overlook, ""Sexual Overlook"". Also as the boy and girl are skipping school to search for the girls birth family they stop to check into a motel (with his father's American Express card...). They end up not going in but their motive is clear. The girl has flashbacks to when she was younger but I was disappointed the reader doesn't find out who she is and what really happened, as the back of the book leads you to believe."
3,From Information Literacy & Technology Class,"The Face on the Milk Carton is an enjoyable mystery book. In the beginning, Janie Johnson sees her face on the milk carton when she was three years old. This book gets you off on an interesting start. Right from the beginning, all you want to know is ""Was Janie kidnapped?"" As Janie goes on a quest to find her true identity, Cooney keeps you on the edge of you seat. There are multiple twists in the story that completely changes the plot. Towards the end, the book becomes dry, but not boring. The Face on the Milk Carton becomes predictable. I was disappointed with the ending, but I would still recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a quick and easy read.-Natasha"
3,It wuz ok,"okokok.....i am a person who thought this book wuz so-so... parts of the book are for mature readers only. Its about a girl named janie and how she found a picture of her when she was little on a milk carton stating she was missing. She acts like a detective and tries to find more info about her childhood. Her nextdoor neighbor reeve tags along on her journey and they also have some love sparks goin on. the book is like a cliffhanger, and thats what i did not like. They dont really tell you what happens to her at the end, so it was like a waste of time because i dont want to read the sequel when there are other fab books to read out there in the world. yes, you may have a different opinion, i am only here to tell you mine. good luck findin a good book to read out there!"
5,Words cant explain..,"I read this book back in sixth grade. My english teacher was having a book club and we were reading this. We were asked to read a hundred pages in a week, me and my friend read this book in two days. When you read this you get pulled in right away, if you wanted to stop at one chapter it would be really hare cause each chapter ends in a wonderful cliff hanger. What i dont like is the serise is a bit slow. I read the whole first and second one and only alittle bit of the 3rd, and read all of the 4th (the last). Its to slow for my liking. But whatever, I still got and liked the book. I think this book is a need to read before high school. :)"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!!!!!,"This was one of my fave books ever! I read for four hours straight until I finished it! After you read it, you HAVE to read the other two books in the series. You would be insulting American literature if you do not read this book. NOW GO! READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Face on The milk carton,In this book a girl that is in her sophomore year of high school looks on the back of the milk carton and sees that she is the missing one on the back of the milk carton. Then she's trying to find out if her parents are her real parents or if they were fake parents. Then she finds out... uh oh I can't tell you that part.I recommend this book for one reason because it is very interesting. One reason I don't recommend it for little children is because it has some inappropriate things for little children. Another reason I recommend it is because it always has you predicting what will happen next. The last reason I recommend it is the finale encourages you to read the next book.
2,Face on the milk carton review,If you are like me you will not like this book.It is about a girl who thinks she is kidnapped by her parents.You would think it is a good book but it isnt.In many parts of the book it draggs.They could have done a lot better with the book.Most of the book is about Reeve the neighbor boy and Janie's love life.It only caught my attention once or twice.I am a person who likes action books.They could have made this a good book but they didnt.
1,"If I could pick one word for this book, it would be terrible","This book was a huge dissapointment to me. The story idea was great; the problem was, the story line strayed off into the romance sub-plot too much, and not focusing enough on the main plot. It was not well written and the ending didn't seem like the ending--it seemed like the book wasn't quite finished. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,The face on the milk carton,"I think this is a good book becauseit tells how it would be like if youwere kidnaped and found your face ona milk carton 12 years latter. I would give this 5 starsbut I gave it 4 instead because getting kidnapedand not knowing that know body has told you the truth forthe last dozen years, that would be sad to find out whoyour real parents are after living with a kidnaper that youare used to living with."
3,An intriguing story,"The Face on the Milk Carton is about a girl named Janie Johnson, who finds her face on a milk carton as a missing child. Janie then begins to question whether her beloved parents are really her parents at all, so she begins a search to find he truth with the help of her next-door neighbor, Reeve Shields. Although, Janie wanted to find out what really happened, she felt that somehow she was betraying her parents. Once Janie uncovers the shocking truth, she then wonders what she should do with her new found secret. The Face on the Milk Carton is a good book filled with mystery and even a little romance. The plot was great, however, I did not like the characters much. Maybe it was because I could not relate to what they were experiencing, so I couldn't feel for the characters. Other than that though, I really liked the book and immediately started the second book, Whatever Happened to Janie, after I finished the first."
3,The Face on the Milk Carton,"This book is the best book I have ever read in my life. Before I started to read this book I hated to read, but when I finished I loved to read. This is a good book because it makes you think about what you read.This book is about a girl named Janie who finds out that she was kidnapped in a shopping center by her own parents. She learns this from reading a missing child notice one milk carton. I rated this book three stars because I would have liked it better with a different ending.Except for the cliff hanger ending, THE FACE ON THE MILK CARTON is the best mystery book I have ever read!!"
4,Face on the Milk Carton,"Janie is a typical fifteen year old. One who is looking forard to getting her driver's license and is interested in boys. Until one day in the cafeteria she looks down at the milk cartoon and see's herself. Listed as kidnapped, the picture shows a three-year old child, one wearing a dress that she remembers. I remember watching the movie when I was a teenager, and absolutely loving it. The book was just as enjoyable. I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series and finding out what happens with Janie and her families."
5,Very good... suspensful too,I bought this book because I thought the cover was interesting (and it seemed cool too). I'm so glad I bought it because I couldn't put it down once I started. You think you know what's going to happen and then it changes. I love that about a book and the second I finished I went out and bought the second book in the series. I recommend it for everyone.
4,The Face On The Milk Carton,"If you like mystery you will like this book. It's about a teenage girl named Jannie who finds a picture of her when she was a little girl on a milk carton. The milk carton says she is missing. She thinks that her parents have kidnapped her and aren't really her parents. This is the only reason for the subscription on the milk carton to be true. She has proof that this is true because her ""parents"" don't have pictures of her until she was around the age of five. They said they just didn't have a camera, and Jannie doesn't believe them. In the end it is a little confusing and it is nothing that you would have ever suspected. I liked this book because you could never put it down once you started reading it. Read it to find out what happens."
3,THE FACE ON THE MILK CARTON IS A GREAT BOOK BY:CB.C,"WHEN FIFTEEN YEAR OLD JANIE SETS DOWN AT LUNCH WITH FIVE OF HER FRIENDS,THERE ALL PASSING THE MILK CARTON WITH A CHILDS FACE ON IT.WHEN IT IS PASSED ON TO JANIE, SHE REALISES THE FACE HIS HER OWN.THIS BOOK IS FULL OF ACTION,SASPINCE,AND A GREAT THRILLER."
3,The Face on the Milk Carton,"I thought that this was a good book. It did have some dull parts though. Its basically about a girl who is living a normal life until one day she recognizes the face on one of those missing person pictures on a milk carton at school. It's her. The book basically describes what she goes through after that. She can't ignore the picture in her head. She finally talks to her parents or so she thought they were her parents. Before that she talks to her boyfriend about it. After all of it, it turns out that her real family is called the Springs. They call her real family and her family wants her back. She has to move with her new family and has to try and adjust to her new lifestyle. This book is book one out of four, so it is only the beginning to her whole new life."
2,Two lefts don't make a right but three do!,"You should only think of things that are pure, praiseworthy, superior, and appropriate, things that are unwholesome, and disgraceful are not to be meditated on. A book that would probably fit the decryption of unwholesome or disgraceful would be The Face On The Milk Carton by Caroline Cooney one of the most frequently challenged books from 1990-1999 according to the American Library Assoc. I think that it should be banned, because in the book there is a lot of inappropriate thing such as curse words, inappropriate kissing, putting down of religions est. If a younger child was to read this book it could make them wonder about things that are not true or are not appropriate for there age group. Censorship is a strong word, but it does mean that children should be exposed to only things that are pure, praiseworthy, and proper, not filling their heads with disgraceful and inappropriate words and situations."
4,"An Okay Book, It Could've Been Better","The Face on the Milk Carton is an okay book, the author (Caroline B. Cooney) does a generally good job on this book. The author uses dialogue very well in order to display emotions, drama, and moving the story on. The story moves on smoothly and the characters each contribute a piece to the plot line.Personally, I am not a fan of fantasy or non-fiction books. This book, the end and surprise climax was extremely unlikely, it was very farfetched and the logic didn't really click with me. It was also a little annoying to me that the author didn't really give the reader a chance to guess why she was stolen. There were useless clues and they didn't specifically contribute to the climax. But, I do have to give it to the author that it was very surprising.If you like emotional books, with drama, family, and a pinch of fantasy, this book is for you, especially if you're in elementary school."
4,it was cool,i liked this book because i didnt know what was going to happen and it was very fun to read!
3,The Face on The Milk Carton,"HI MY NAME IS ALEXIS FERRARO.I AM GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THE BOOK IT GO LIKE THIS.THE BOOK IS ABOUT A GIRL NAMED JANIE THAT HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.WHEN SHE WAS 3 YEARS OLD.NOW SHE IS IN THE 10 GRADE.HER BEST FRIENDS ARE SARAH-CHARLOTTE,ADAIR,AND HER DREAMER BOY REEVE.ONE DAY SHE WAS AT LUNCH AND WAS GOING TO TAKE A DRINK OF MILK WHEN SHE SEEN A LITTLE GIRL ON THE MILK CARTON THAT HAD THE SAME RED HAIR AND JANIE HAD THE LITTLE DRESS THAT THE GIRL HAD ON.LATER ON IN THE BOOK SHE WANTS TO GET HER TEMPS BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A BIRTH-CERTIFICATE.ONE DAY SHE WENT UP TO THE ATTIC WHERE SHE FINDS SOME MORE STUFF ABOUT HER SELF."
4,Rachel's review of: The face on the milk carton,I think that the face on the milk carton was a good book. I am not a big reader but when I read a book and start the whole sequence then it is a good book. I have alot of friends that think this is a good book also.I am not a big reader so I usualy don't understand or remember anything about it and it was such a good book that I remember alot of it and I haven't read it in a while. My favorite part of the book would have to be when Jainie and Reeve are outside he grabs her and starts passionally kissing her. This book to me is a romantic mystery book. That is what I would put it under if I had to catorgorize it. Overall the book was great it is a kinda book I would suggest to all my friends to read but only one problem they all read it along with me.I like to read Caroline B Coooney's books now. I think that it was a sad book because it is about a teenager living a life with people that wern't really her parents and she didn't even know it.
5,A verry good listen....,An outstanding book. If you don't have the time to read the book this cassette set is just as good. Miss Jodi Benson (the voice of the little mermaid) Reads the story of a grild who find out she was kidnapped 12 years before. DO NOT let the fact that this is a book for young adults through you off. Halfway though it I forgot altoghter. It is that good..
4,The Face On The Milk Carton,It was definitely a mystery book which a lot of people will enjoy. If you like mysterious books and suspense then this is a book for you!
5,Review,Arrived on time. Daughter likes the book very much. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
3,The Face On The Milk Carton!!!!!!!!!`,"This book was fun, yet some what boring. If you like mysteries this is the book for you! Here is what this book is about--Janie Johnson is a pretty normal kid. Life is at its finest when one day at lunch Janie took a quick glimpse of the missing child on the milk carton. She recognized the white dress in the photograph and the tight dark brown pig tails on the little girl. Could this little girl in this picture be her? This little girl who had had been kidnaped in a New Jersey shopping center? Janie was overcome with shock. How could this possibly be true? No way could her loving parents who had been at her side her entire life (or most of her life anyway) had driven all the way out to New Jersey to kidnap her. But if they did kidnap her, are Mr. and Mrs. Johnson Janie's real parents? If not, who is Janie Johnson, and what really happened?"
3,The Face on the Milk Carton,This book was a great mystery thriller. This book is about a girl in high school named Janie.Janies life was almost perfect until one day she steals a milk carton from her friend. She sees a familiar face on it and notices its her when she was three. One day she goes up to her attic and finds the dress thats on the milk carton. Janie keeps thinking if her parents are kidnappers or her actuall parents. Who put the picture on the milk carton? If you want to find out if Janie was really kidnapped read this book. I recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries.
4,Face on the Milk Carton,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The story line is very interesting and entertaining. I would recommend this book for teenagers, 12+. It tells the story of Janie, a girl who finds out she was kisnapped from a shopping mall 12 years ago."
4,The good book,I got this book for my bitherday seven mothes later I read the book. The book dose talk about sex some waht. The book should be for kids 14 and up. I liked the book a lot more then the movie. As soom as I finshed the book I bought the sequle from Amazom.com and just finshed reading it. and then bought The voice on the raido. So if I were you I would read the book!
4,STOLEN,"STOLEN ****I'm reading the book "" The Face On The Milk Carton"". By Caroline Coonley. It's about a girl who when she was a junior, she saw a face that she recognized on a milk carton, but the weird thing about it is that the person who was on the carton was stolen when they were about three years old. After she saw that she started having odd daydreams, weird things would happen, she would have no idea what was happening. In one she saw a little girl receiving candy from her mother, or adult figure. She also discovered it was more then just an ordinary girl...I liked this book a lot; it kept my attention throughout most of the book. I thought it was a well-written book, had enough characters but not too many were you lose tract of them all and you get confused. I thought it had a great plot, very creative, and well thought of. I would recommend this book for someone who likes surprising twists."
4,"Taryn, M, Miller Place, NY","Caroline B. Cooney wrote the book The face on the Milk Carton. It was a very good book. This is a fiction book that was a big mystery. A high school girl named Janie is sitting at lunch and notices the MISSING label on the milk carton, she looks at the little girl in the polkadotted dress and realizes that the little girl in the picture was her, and that picture was taken 8 years ago. Janie was very confused and worried about this. She tried asking her so called ""parents"" for her birth certificate, etc. but they wont give it to her. This gets Janie very worried, so she starts putting all the pieces together. This book made me want to read on and not put it down because it was such a good book and i wanted to see what happened next. This book makes me realize that people do get kidnapped, and bad things happen in life. If your into mysteries and drama, then this book is good for you."
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"The Face on the Milk Carton is an exciting book with wild adventures! I loved this book because it kept me interested and never got boring. This is the type of book that is hard to set down and keeps you turning page after page anxious to find what's next. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone about 12 years of age and up that is interested in a book filled with an aspiring young woman, Janie, and her journey to uncover her real history, accompanied by her friend Reeve. Are her mother and father her real parents? Is that really Janie on the side of the milk carton? Has her whole life been a lie? Read this exciting book to find out!"
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"I really enjoyed reading this book for manny reasons. Mainly because of the suspense at the end when Janie calls the Springs and tells them that she thinks she is their daughter. I like that because it makes you interested to read the next book. In away it gives you a hint about how the next book will be like. Or how it will start. I also like the book because it has alot of drama and romance in it. I like the little match up between Janie and Reeve and how Janie is like the typical ""girl next door."" It also has the Drama of Janie losing the letter she wrote to the Springs. The best thing I like about this book is the little bits of memories she has through out the book. It gives descriptive memories of the Springs even though she doesn't know it. That is why i think this is a really good book."
3,jacquie's ILE book review,i really liked this book.Ithink it was fun to read.Through the whole book Iwas wondering what was going to happen next.MY favorite part is when Janie and Reeve start kissing in the leaves.That makes the book have some romance in it.It is also sad because Janie really loved the Johnsons but she had to find out that they were not her parents.
5,Wow!,"Holy cow! I read The Face on the Milk Carton and it is fantastic. It is so perfect! Romance, Mystry! i twists all over the place. Now, I'm pretty good at guessing plots, but not in this one. Janie Johnson is a 15 year old lactosintolerant girl. One day at lunch, she sneaks Sarah-Charolets milk, and find's a picture of herself on the back as a three-year old. She becomes obsesed with finding out what happened.Along with Reeve, her sexy Boyfriend, she yerns to find the truth.She suddenly has these flash-backs to her childhood. Will these help her at all? Read to find out."
5,So Touching I Couldn't Put It Down,It was so great!A touching Story I couldn't put it down!Though it had sexual content it put a good spin on it.I can't wait to read Whatever Happened To Janie.
1,Terrible Novel,I thought this novel would interest me because I am into criminology but it was down-right awful. The first half of the book was boring and nothing happened. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Full of Sexually Suggestive Material - Not for young readers,"I was surprised at the amount of suggestive sexual material was in this book. While the story is good, I feel that this book should be directed at an older audience than it currently is. I work in a library and I know that there are kids as young as 8 reading this material! While we do live in a highly sexualized country, do you want your child exposed to this? If you want to learn more about this story I suggest that you watch the movie."
1,Terrible for a young child,"I read this book, or started to, in fourth grade. I had to return it to the library after the first fifty pages, it just filled me with too much fear. Everything about the story just filled me with doubt and mistrust. It took me months to get over the fear that my parents had kidnapped me, and for several months I felt I couldn't trust them. Overall, don't read this until you're ready to accept its ideas as pure fiction."
4,The Face On The Milk Carton,"- Caroline Cooney has put together an awesome book, The Face On The Milk Carton, fit for almost all ages, filled with a spell-binding tale. I know everyone hates a book that takes forever to get to the main point or the really good parts, but Cooney goes right out from the beginning telling you what the real mystery is, and she keeps you clinging to the mystery until the last word. You can feel the roller coaster that the author takes this girl on throughout her journey to find out who she really is, who the bad guys are, and who she can trust. This book can never be just left on the shelf unread. Caroline Cooney has written it so that you almost have to read it in one sitting, and I'm positive the continuations to this book, Whatever Happened To Janie and The Voice On The Radio, will do exactly the same. This book is what some people describe as a ""real page turner"" and is it ever!"
2,Could Have Been Better,"Though I have heard many reviews that rave about this book, personally, i did not enjoy it. Her blind faith in her next door neighbor is questionable and her denial that she had been kidnapped-when there is plently of evidence that proves that she was indeed kidnapped-is rather pathetic. Also stuff could have been added and there was things that you didn't need to know. The ending cuts off aruptly so you have to go out and get the second one."
4,The Face On The Milk Carton,"I give this book 4 stars because it is very intesting and exciting! It kept me hocked the whole time I read it and I did not want to put it down! There are a few parts were it lost me put close to the end I stayed up all night woundering what was going to happen next! To my surprise there are three books that follow! If you love to read, just like me, this is the perfect book for you! I love this book and I hope you do too!"
4,This book is wonderful but not quite a 5 star,"The book A Face on a Milk Carton is wonderful by Caroline B. Cooney. If you like a book that keeps you guessing then i am sure you would like this book. But the book is kind of slow in some parts so it may get kind of boring. This book does contain a little to much for the young ones.When sunddely Janie finds out that she has been kidnaooed by her parents at the age of 3. she doesnt want to say a word to her so called ""Parents."" well she wants her birth certificate to see if her ""Parents"" are really herparents she finds out in her moms office the bottom draws on her desk are lock..... could she be hiding something or what. janie desides she should go into the attic and look inside the old trunk that she had seen once before.well she finds somehting about someone that she may not want to know about... but thats all i can tell you now you should read the book to find more [about] it."
4,The Face on the Milk Carton,"The Face on the Milk Carton is a very good book. It is about a girl who is sixteen years old who starts to become curious as to why her parents won't let her start driving because of a birth certificate problem. In the midst of all this curiosity at school she goes to drink some milk and on the back of the carton she is staring back at herself...literally. Her picture was on the back of the milk carton. When she goes home she looks in her closet and sees that the dress she saw herself in the picture is in her attic. So she goes to figure out what is going on, and also at the same time she is trying to keep her boyfriend, Reeve. I recommend this book to you if you like romance mystery books because this book has a little bit of both. Is Janie really Janie? Did her sweet loving parents really steal her from a shopping mall in New Jersey? What will happen between Janie and Reeve? To answer these and other questions read The Face on the Milk Carton.Andy Zaleski"
3,The Face On The Milk Carton,"I think it was a great book, but it was not the type of book I would usually read. it is a exciting book though that's why I gave it three stars!!!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"I loved this book it was a great book. This is one of the best books I've ever read! I guess because I felt like I was there most of the time.It has a lot of feelings talked about in it.I would definitly recommend this book to anyone who reads and even everyone who doesn't read, because this book would make them want to read more and more books.I rated this book a 5 star because it was a great book and I would read it again and again and again if i could. This book kept me in suspense and made me want to read more and more. It kind of was a mystery at the end and I would definitly read the next book.You may want to read this book for yourself to see just how great it is! My favorite character was probably Reeve. All the more I can say is that I loved this book so...PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!..."
2,Slow & Boring,I didn't like this book. It was slow and boring to me. The only good part of the book to me was the end. It made me want to read some of the other book to see what would happen next. I think the author should have written the book like the end. Overall I think this story was not for me.
3,The face on the milk carton,After reading the face on the milk carton I was sad. Janiewent through so much. Could you think about how hard it would be tohave done as much as her. Knowing that the people that you know andlove are not your mother and father. Would be so hard. Its good thatthey are her grandparnts then no being family at at all. Revee was a real goodfriend/boyfriend. Because he was their for her when she need him.She should be thankful she had him. I would have been.
4,This book was ok,"The book, The Face on the Milk Carton, was a very good book. I thought that she should have found out eairlier that she was taken. The theme was well thought out. I would recomnend this book to anyone."
3,The Face on the Milk Carton - Danielle,"IT all started when Janie was at school taking a drink from her friends milk carton. She shes herself on the back of it as a missing child when she was three named Jennie Springs. She gets very suspicious, so she tries to find clues if she was kidnapped. She finds a box marked ""Hannah"" in the attic with the dress that was in the picture of the kidnapping. Also when she asks her parents if they had any baby pictures of her they said they never took any. So her n Reeve go to New Jersey to see her old house. Is is Janie or Jennie? read the book to find out!"
5,Best book ever,"It was a wonderful book. there was a lot of detail to descibe the cherecters. It was also a cliff hanger which I loved about the book, and other books. It also had a little over romance, which droped my rating by .5, but there isnt a 4.5 option so I settled for 5. The romance enhanced the book, but not what happened when Janie and Reeve almost did going home from New Jersey. Yet, I cant imagine the book without Reeve. Other than that it was a fabolous book."
5,Milk is GOOD,This book is a five star book!!!! I love it so much!!! Partly becuase I like mystery/adventurous books and I would recommend this to all of the people who like mystery/adventure. It is a GREAT book about a GREAT family when everything goes wrong when Janie Jonhson decides she wants to drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid - she learns too much...
4,Face on the milk carton,"In this book a girl named Janie get's the suspicion that she has been kid napped. Janie thinks she has been kid napped when she steals Sarah-Charlet's milk and reconizes the picture of the missing person on the back of the milk carton. Janie gets more suspicious when her mother can not provide her with a birth certificat, and when she notices that they have no pictures of her under the age of 5. Later in the book she finds the poka dotted dress from the picture on the milk carton in a truk in the attic. Then Janie is debating wheather or not to call the missing persons number on the back of the milk carton."
3,This is an okay book,"I thought this book was okay, but I definately like the other books in this series a lot more! I didn't think that this book was very catchy. In some parts it was hard to understand but in others it was very easy. I think it gives you a good picture of Janie and Reeve, and it gave a good backround of them if you are going to read the whole series. I would recomend this book to begining readers because it is very easy."
4,the face on the milks girle review,I think that the Face on The Milk Cartoon was a fantastic book.it really keeps you guessing about whats going to happen next. The book was very up and daown. Meaning there was supence and then it cooled down. I loved how the begining began. where everything started at really one place and then grew.Overall this first seris of the book is really great.
1,Just a commercial for their tour.,Do not buy this video! It is horrible. It is just a commercial for their tour. There is very little action sequences and most of them are from Crusty 1 and Crusty 2. I was very disappointed in this video. Don't waste your money like I did.
2,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 14","In my opinion, a minor movie in André de Toth's career. However, one may note that the famous scene of bandits offering champagne and free brunch to the passengers of the stagecoach can be found in Carson City. If you're in the mood for a few reflections, you may also ruminate about how De Toth handles the theme of the double in this film : the Kincaid brothers, the double tunnel, etc.. A DVD zone completists. Only."
3,GO GO Pen,I would not recommend this product for inside use.No way to stake it down. Outside you can stake the go go pen to the ground for stability.
3,Ok,"The 36"" is too tall to bend over. I was hoping I could bend over and quickly lift puppy out or clear up messes. I thought that might happen so I bought this as it has a door.I thought that door was supposed to be for humans to easily get in and out but it has bars over it and under it so you would have to go through it 'doggy style' and who would do that? - it should be more clear on description.Also if fitting onto a wire crate the ""door"" can only be fitted to one side.So if you think you can get away with a 30"" high one then buy that one and not this one."
4,Home Saver,"Good quality. Easy to open/assemble in various shapes to fit your needs; however, not as easy to close. You have to close it in just the right order or the last panel will not close completely. Also, I'm 5'10"" and it's a little too tall to easily bend over and pickup things from the floor inside the pen. If I had to buy it again, I would get the 30"" high panels which would be too tall for most dogs to jump out of and low enough to pick up items from the floor inside the pen."
4,An idea whose time has come,"It's so great to have these all in one place. The quality of the scans is amazing, you can fill your screen with a panel & not lose any quality of resolution. My only complaint is with the way the 2 page layout works with Adobe Acrobat format. It's not really made for reading facing pages. If Marvel had them as single pages, it'd be a lot less klunky. All in all, a great product. My son and I are having a great time reading them together, from start to finish (the Spiderman set, too). I recommend it highly."
1,won't work outside US,I'm disapointed... I bought this but it won't work outside US. It's absurd that it is not specified on the product. Shame on Marvel.
1,"Item was used, not new","Package was opened when received, there was gummy residue on outside of package, item aws supposed to be ""New"" and the DVD appeared to be used."
1,BAD DVD,"This DVD arrived with no data on the disk at all, the DVD had the artwork on the disk, but not a single bit of data. I can understand mistakes will happen in processing, but when I returned it, Amazon charged me $2.99 for the privilege of returning a defective product; all in all a pretty good scam- just send out defective products and get $3 for everyone who returns them."
2,Poor quality images used,"Many of the covers, arguably the highlight of a comic, have ""NOT TO BE SOLD"" stamped on them. For this price they should have used clean copies."
5,They're wires!,"They're wires!! They have a small doodad on one end that fits in the camera and a larger one at the other end and electrons magically travel from one end to the other. I can't tell you how they do it but pictures somehow appear on a computer monitor and so I'm pretty sure that there are no shorts in the wire which is nice because the only reason to have the wire is to allow electrons to move from one end to the other without interruption. It's a black wire which sort of gets me down in that it reminds me of long winter nights rather than colorful spring flowers but since the wire is usually kept in a dark case, I guess it doesn't make a difference.One hint...This wire is not an appropriate anniversary or birthday gift for the lady in your life"
3,great customer service,"After initially reviewing this product about how I was unhappy with what I received, I soon received an email from the seller stating they would offer me a full refund of the product, which went above and beyond what I expected. It was a very courteous email and generous offer. I know it is not much to refund, but still nice to see a company care for its customers. The product I received works, but has poor connectivity and often fails when loading pictures. Seems to be an isolated incident and will gladly purchase other products from them again since their customer service seems to be well above par."
1,Wrong size,The cable i ordered for my Pentex camera does not fit my camera - the shipping cost more then the cable.
1,Optio S50 Compatible?,"Either there is something wrong with my camera or this is not compatible with the Optio S50. I was unable to transfer any of my pictures to my computer, and kept receiving an error message every time I plugged the device in. I have tried other usb card readers with no problems. The only reason I ordered this was so that I would not have to remove the memory card each time I went to transfer the files to my computer, and risk losing the data by not ejecting it properly. Why I keep getting this error message I do no know."
1,erroneously advertised at Amazon,Amazon's description says this cable is compatible with the Optio 450. Not true. The black plastic lug at the camera end prevents coupling.
4,Pentex USB transfer cable,This product is exactly what I was looking for. I searched in stores but they were unable to provide me with the correct wire.
1,Not Compatible with Optio W60,"Big problem.This is supposed to be used to download photos from the Optio to a computer.The USB side of the equation is OK.The other end, however has a thick plug which interferes with the casing of the camera. It's quite different from the slim plug pictured. You have to force it it, and even then you don't always get a positive contact.Products that don't work should be removed from the site.Why is this one still here?Anybody home???"
5,Pentax I-USB7 USB Cable,"I needed an extra USB cable for my Pentax digital camera to take on the road and the I-USB7 USB Cable filled the bill. The cable is as well built as the original that came with the camera. The only physical difference observed is the camera side plug body is a bit thicker than the OEM. However, this in no way affects the functionality of the cable."
5,Just what I needed,Tried to find a replacement cord for the camera in local stores with no luck. This product arrived as ordered and works perfectly with the Pentax Optio W30 camera. I do not have any negative comments as it is made just for my camera.
2,naaaaaaa,"Low budget sex movie from the late 70's. Might has been exiting then, butby today's standards it is quite boring,,,stupid robot. The sexy Alicein Wonderland was much better."
3,seein; me,got this because I was in it and had never seen it. Now that i've seen Me i probably will not see it again.
3,"2,000 Is Not Enough!","It is a beautiful little book but I need a more complete reference...the first few names I looked up weren't included, and I also want more background on the genus name as well as on the common name. Guess I'll have to go for the big bucks! :)"
3,"Nice book, but not for everyone","I think this is a very nice book; it is very informative. However, I was surprised when I received it that it was pocket sized and the typeface was very small. It can be difficult to read for some people."
4,It's so handy...,"The AHSGPG is a wonderful little book. It has practically every living plant known to man. Not only does it give descriptions on plants/trees/shrubs, but this book also gives you a climate planting guide, as well as suggestions on the different kinds of plants to plant in different areas of the U.S. Even small container gardens, shade gardens, full sun gardens along with different soil limitations. It's small size is what I love...small enough to tuck in a purse when going plant shopping!"
2,"Not Bad, But Not Necessary","As someone ""interested"" in identifying good candidates, I have the following two recommendations for anyone interested in West Point:1) Get your information about the process of getting intoWest Point directly from Admissions -- FREE!2) Get your information about the true significance of WHYthe exceptional choose West Point by reading thebook, ""West Point"", by Norman Thomas Remick.As someone long involved, that's my best advice to anyone who wants to take a look at a West Point education."
1,Self-serving,"Maybe it's just me, but I find it very self-serving that an author would write in the reviews about his own book, as I notice was done here. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said there was no need to pay for this book when your tax dollars already pay West Point to give the public information about how to prepare, get in, and survive."
1,An Unnecessary Book,"This appears to be just another book invented to make money off my alma mater. You can get all the necessary information in this book from, or through, the more than capable Admissions Office at West Point ---FREE! Correction. You very well had better get it, for your taxpayer dollars are paying the salaries and huge overheads for the ones who are there for that purpose. I am sure everyone is well-meaning. But --- really now --- lets not be disingenuously exploitive. This is an unnecessary book. Spend your money on information you cannot get for free."
2,Seriously outdated information,"Mr. Smallwood means well in writing this book, and I must say it DID help me...when I bought the book back when I was 12!!!Now that I have already gone through the Admissions process, and am now going to West Point, I must admit that the information in the book is horribly outdated, especially about the Nomination process!I feel that by reading, ""Absolutely American,"" and gobbling up the wonderful catalogs and brochures that the Admissions Office provides for...free, you'll be good to go!"
2,Goes against what the cadets themselves say,"I bought this book at USMA after finishing an overnight there, and read about a third of it on the way home. The book (written only in 2000) completely contradicts what other publications and cadets themselves (particularly Plebes) told me regarding Beast, academics, military training, etc., and some of the admission data was inaccurate. Aside from this, the writing is horrible and the author often drones on at times. You get the feeling that you are reading the script from a 1950s newsreel at times. On a positive note, when interviewing members of the math and chemistry department, one can see what they should brush up on before the go to the Academy. Do not buy this book if you are seeking admission, and even if you have your appointment, in my opinion it was still a waste of money."
4,"Character-driven page turner with an ""Up North"" setting",Very entertaining novel focusing more on the mental turmoils of the characters than the wildfire. Provides some awakening insight to the life for those of the deep North woods and forest firefighting. Pyper has a pure talent for detailing the sensory and mind-twisting of his characters. Excellent read.
5,A Delightful Story,This is a wonderful story about the earth and animals that sparks the imagination and glorifies God's creation. The illustrations are as magical as the story. It is a great bedtime story that my daughter asks for frequently. The only downside is that this is not a hard cover book. This will be a favorite in our home.
3,This is a great book !,"You're sitting down about to read Oddballs and the first thing you see is ""To my family: Please forgive me."" That is a very creative start to a book. The characters include Vicky, who loves to dye her hair with grape juice, Bill, the reassuring older brother, and Danny and Tycho,the youngest of the family.The book also has its downs.I mean one minute the chapter is the funniest, then you get to the next chapter and it is so dull. He should have thought about some of the chapters a little more carefully before writing them.This is a three star book all the way.I would recommend this book for someone who wants a good laugh and wouldn't mind reading something a little different."
5,I read this book while in an Advanced Placement course.,"I read this book my during my junior year in high school. I believe this is the best book I have read yet to this day, (I'm 26). After the first couple of pages I was seriously laughing out loud. No book has ever made me laugh out loud. I reccommended it to my best friend and I hope you read it as well. Those oddballs are a crazy group. You wonder how they survived with each other. Oddballs was a great book, funny, interesting, entertaining, and just all around great! Please read this book, however old you are."
5,A Paragon,"In retrospect of Dr. Robert Nozik's new book ""Happy 4 Life"", the most salient lesson I have learned, which now affects my every day practice life, must be the ability of removing one-self from a confrontational or adversarial situation. At a neutral distance, I can now evaluate my point of view and that of my oponent, and then either reach a compromise or admit that I was wrong. I highly recommend this book for any-one in a service profession. Stephen J.F. Zuber D.P.M. - Clinical Professor Podiatric Medicine"
3,A book for specialists,"If you have read extensively about the Lost Generation and their Paris, then the McAlmon chapters will further illuminate what others have said. If you are fairly new to the subject, this book will bore you to tears with its laundry lists of who/what/where/exactly when and at what time so-and-so got drunk. I do not think Kay Boyle's chapters do anything but prove how odious she was."
2,doesn't get you very far,"Of all the mandolin methods I possess, I would have to say this is the one that gets you the least far. By the end of the book, you're playing simple melodies in G and F (one sharp, one flat). That's not very impressive. I would recommend instead DelGrosso'sHal Leonard Mandolin Methodfor the casual learner."
4,Good!,This was a required textbook for my American Literature class and I really enjoy it. It does seem unbalanced in author representation. Some major authors only have one or two works yet some have five. It is a rather varied and good collection of work though.
2,For school only,I found this book to be kinda racist and it is one that I will never read again. I did not like the time period
5,Anthology of American Lit,"I needed this book for a class and purchasing it through the school would have been nearly $100. I bought it here used and saved myself a lot. This book is great. It might have a few pencil marks, but it's a great deal."
2,misrepresentation of condition of book,"I was very disappointed in the condition of this book. It was listed in excellent condition with minimal writing on the outside of the book. Not only was there writing on the outside but there was excessive writing inside the book as well. My daughter was unable to use it for her high school english class and I had to purchase another book. I emailed the seller and he did not reply. Although my investment of around $14.00 was not huge, it was still money down the drain! I would not buy from this seller again."
5,Fast Secure Shipping!,The college bookstore was TOO busy this semester. I took a couple of minutes and LOTS OF FAITH in ordering the volumes on-line. This order was shipped and at my home before I could blink!
2,Sized Differently than stated : (,"The size that I ordered from their description was off by 2 to 4 inches on every dimension, and the quality was marginal at best."
2,"Intense, Scary if you're a woman!","I personally thought this was a scary book, that I would not have read if I knew about it more. It scared me because the main character, ""The Butcher,"" was a rapist who killed many woman. It was scary and kind of disgusting to hear about these women being raped, and it felt as if you were there, watching it in person. It makes you want to cry, it's so intense. - But you do hear about a couple, Graham and Connie, who barely survived, because of the Butcher and his evil gun. The only part I enjoyed was when you hear about Ira Preduski, the detective, who seemed to be so nice and caring towards these people. He was kind and warm hearted. He made the day. - So, if you are looking for a more scary, thriller book, check into this one. If you are like me, then STAY AWAY!"
2,Great buildup and then it falls flat,"I enjoyed the book until the ending. That was the one of the most disappointing endings to a book I have ever read. However, I guess every book of his isn't going to be fantastic. I thought the main theme of this book was very interesting, and the standard man and woman who fight the villain together and also become romantically involved (or at least attracted) is not a problem for me. Even though it's in every one of his books, it's also in most action movies and TV series (for example ""The Outer Limits""). It's something that writers seem to think is necessary to appeal to the widest audience, to have a male and female protagonist. This book isn't one of his best--try ""Servants of the Twilight"", ""Midnight"", or ""Mr. Murder""."
4,Dean Koontz collection complete,"The Face of FearI purchased a hardcover copy of Dean Koontz's The Face of Fear. It arrived in the condition described. It arrived in a timely manner. I'm pleased with my puchase. This book completes my quest to collect all of Dean Koontz's books in hardcover. Thank you, Amazon.com and those booksellers who helped me with my collection.Sincerely,Teresa"
4,A Great and Classic Novel By One of the Masters,"This is classic Koontz, I have read pretty much everything he has written and it is one of my favorites! It is the story of a psychic and his girlfriend trapped in his office building in the middle of the night by a serial killer called ""The Butcher"". The killer thinks the psychic will identify him and decides to to take him out and have a speacial little moment with his girlfriend. They actually made a T.V. movie about this book a while back.It is a short book like most of his earlier stuff but it is fast paced and non-stop action. The villain is a mean and sick individual. The only thing i didnt like was the boring description of mountain climbing. Other than that, agreat book and I recommend it for anyone who likes the genre."
4,An alright book,"Dean Koontz's The Face of Fear was an excellent book, but I was disappointed in the ending. Overall the book was great. The novel focused mainly on the police and a clairvoyant named Graham Harris trying to catch a killer named the Butcher. Some of the parts of the book are extremely graphic, so I would not recommend this book for anyone under seventeen or someone who has a weak stomach. The ending, like I said, was disappointing because I expected for something else to happen that was more exciting. I am starting to like Dean Koontz's books and... this is a good buy."
3,Great ending salvages an otherwise standard novel.,"The Face of Fear is a good novel, with a number ofsuspenseful situations. However, in comparison withsome of his best work, The Face of Fear only works asmild entertainment, not reching the level of qualitythat Koontz manages so gracefully in other books.However, what makes this a step above some ofhis other weaker novels is a great twist in the endingthat is more satisfying than anything else in the book."
3,Not his best but good,"Like many of Dean Koontz's books, this is one of those books that has a lot happen over a short period of time. It doesn't have too much of a supernatural element, beyond the Butcher's ""out there"" rantings and Graham's psychic powers. However, it was very exciting. The climax, which stretches for quite a while, where Graham and Connie try to climb down the exterior of a forty-floor skyscraper, was absolutely thrilling. It has plenty of twists and turns, and in typical Dean Koontz fashion, the ""twist"" is revealed in bite-size chunks strewn from beginning to end."
2,hmmmmmmmmm,"To tell you the truth, i cant even remember which book this was. They are all too similar and their titles border on thoughtlessness. I enjoyed Koontz before i started reading people who spent a bit more time with their novels and payed a greater attention to details. It is my feeling that Koontz writes like the rest of us use the toilet. He just sits down once a day and squeezes one out. Where do all of these books come from and how do they keep getting elected best sellers? They arent bad or uninteresting, but they are more like an outline for what could be a very interesting world than an actual novel. If you want something you can read in a day and not have to think much about then go for it. His novels are entertaining. If you are interested by complex characters and twisting storylines then look elsewhere. Leave Dean on his porcelain throne..."
1,Koontz actually wrote this?,"I tell ya, after reading Twilight Eyes and Seize the Night, I was in love with Koontz. I read this book next, and I honestly do not believe Koontz wrote this. It seems as if this book was written for a much younger audience than his other books, and the plot is basically pieced together from other far superior books. About 1/4 of the way through this book, i really was thinking about just quitting, but i kept reading, hoping for that major plot twist or ubelievable ending. Sadly, the last half of the book is just as boring as the first. I was hugely disappointed in this book. You want a good Koontz book, read Twilight Eyes. And buy this book for your ten year old son or daughter."
5,THE FACE OF FEAR,THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A LOVER OF SUSPENCE NOVELS. PROMPT AND COURTEOUS SERVICE. HOPE TO PURCHASE MORE OF THIS TYPE OF BOOK
3,Dean Koontz Faces of Fear,"The book has a great story line and is a good addition to my Koontz collection. I was a bit disapointed by the condition of the book, expecting it to be less worn. But, overall, a good find, especially since it came all the way from Britain."
3,An uneven work.,"Rather than providing a consistent analysis, this is more like some kind of unplanned buffet of essays. Small bites for everyone, but nothing that satify an academic appetite for analysis."
2,Missing washer,Item was missing a washer that holds the valve cover on. Only came with 3 suppose to have 4. Had to reuse old part. Be careful when purchasing.
1,Next time I buy from the dealer,"Purchased this valve cover set for my 1995 Honda Accord with 2.2 engine. All parts in the set fine except the most important one, the valve cover gasket. Gasket is slightly off spec, with biggest problem being that it does not fit very snugly into the groove in the valve cover. (Yes, I know how to put the gasket on without stretching it, I've done this lots of times in the past with no problem). As a result, the gasket does not stay in the groove when you turn the valve cover over to place it back on the engine; and because you can't easily see the gasket once the valve cover is in place, you can't tell if you've gotten a proper seal or will leak oil. Next time will spend a bit more and buy the gasket set from the dealer, as not worth the hassle for the few dollars saved."
2,for scientists only!,"This is very theoretical stuff. It seems to be written by academical scientists and you can hardly feel the connection to real world, although the second half of this book consists of 4 cases. These are, however, so similar to each other and pretty borring. The Sherlock approach seems to be simply 5-steps process of domain-oriented software production and it isn't worth any book, maybe some articles at most. But if you are research worker at a university and you treat the software production as matter of theory, it is a suitable book for you. Who is looking for practical advices should rather avoid reading it."
3,Lovely Coloring Book - CD Needs Work!,"The coloring book has wonderful pictures to go along with the poems; however, the person reading the poems on the CD sounds like a hypnotic witch! I've asked 3 people to listen to her and they all agree that she sounds too creepy for little kids. If you purchase this, just plan on using the coloring book."
4,When friendship hurts,"A pretty good book on the ins and outs of friendship though it doesn't delve much into what does make a good friendship or how to improve friendship skills. However for those problematic friendships, it does a great job and I guess that is what it promises. Goes through the common problems in quite a detailed way which is really helpful. Has a number of examples and short interviews also. A good solid book on friendship."
2,superficial shallow and dismissive - there are better books on this topic,"This book has tm (trademark) next to the terms the author has ""coined."" A little too processed and gimmicky for me, and too superficial to label the friendships that didn't work out as being toxic.Better books on the same theme are The Friend Who Got Away and Secrets and Confidences -- both of these delve deeply and questioningly into the very complicated nature of female relationships."
2,simplistic,"I didn't care for this book, much, as I found the examples and explanations overly simplified. While the book is based on research (interviews), I found that the examples given were often somewhat extreme examples and didn't readily apply to my, apparently more benign, situations. This book lacked a depth of explanation and came across, at times, as clinical. For a topic that is so frought with emotion, the book failed to capture the true essence of betrayal, hurt, conflict, etc. in friendships. I did find a few research based facts enlightening. And reading the book did, at least, provide motivation to look at some of my friendships and former friendships. However, I didn't feel the book provided me with much new insight, factual information, or coping strategies."
3,Just Average,"I bought this for a specific reason. When betrayed by a friend. Actually, the book is thought provoking at some levels. Explains when you shouldnt be friends with a person... found out I was giving way toooooo much benefit of the doubt to friends. I needed to cut back."
4,Interesting Insights,"With a Ph.D., the author is well-qualified to talk about the subject of friendship, and offers many helpful insights. It's a comprehensive reference book on friendship that can also be used as a book club study; there are twelve discussion questions at the end of the book. Jan Yager talks about all different kinds of friendships, including friendships between siblings and how those relationships in the family affect your friendships throughout life. She also mentions children and teen friendships and bullying, and offers helpful resources for parents.The reason I didn't give this book five stars is because of the tiny print and technical-style writing with long sentences and large blocks of text. But the information it offers is very valuable as a textbook to keep in your family library. The author makes no mention of God, which disappointed me as well. All in all, though, I like it."
3,Didn't help,"Yes it's well written. Yes there are little stories to learn from. Where this book didn't help is that I am not going to make up with the creepy, hater guy at work that I never want to see again. I'm not going to make amends with the friend from high school who was just too negative to be around. I'm not going to play poker again with the moody girl who cheats. It also didn't help me with the girlfriends that stopped calling ME back. The book explains these quirky people but end result will be the same. You will find a way to avoid them to make more time for the positive people in your life. Growing apart is a fact of life."
1,Waste of time,Does one really need to ANALYZE one's friends? Either friendships work out or they don't...it's a cycle as old as time.
5,An excellant deal,"The ATI Wonder VE is an excellent addition to any computer. Don't believe some of the stories about compatability issues with Windows XP. If you download the drivers from the manufacturer's website, there should be no problems. The instructions are clear and written by someone who is fluent in English. That can be a rare case with this kind of product. To conclude, the ATI Wonder VE gives high picture quality and functionality for a very low price."
2,I'm sorry to say I can't recommend,"This product has some great claims. I was really excited to get it in the mail. But after trying it out on 2 separate computers, including one that was brand new with all new drivers and a fresh load of XP the bottom line is that this ATI TV Wonder VE is a piece of junk.The main problem involves frequent lock-ups while in capture mode. This happened on both machines. It doesn't recognize that DirectX 9 is installed, it doesn't recognize it's own capture drivers from the ATI site (yes I checked to make sure I was loading the right drivers that go with this card.)Normally I'm a fan of ATI's stuff - and some of their display adapters have been great. But as for the TV Wonder VE - I recommend that you pass it up and buy from another vendor. It will save you a lot of headache."
2,Compatability problems,"I purchased this item two years ago. It worked for a few months before it began to interfere with my Intel video chipset. Even with tech support, my video struggled to return to normalcy. You can't beat the price for PCI TV tuner and the picture was great when I used a good antenna. Now that I've upgraded to Windows XP, I've abandoned all hope of it working with my computer. My Windows diagnostic recognizes it as incompatible hardware."
1,Don't buy this card,"This card does _NOT_ work with WindowsXP. Do not buy it if you have, or plan to have, WindowsXP. After purchasing this product, I was able to install the drivers, but then only received audio on one channel (NO video). Also, I used the latest available drivers off of the ATI website, not the ones included on the outdated cd. I am using an nVidia video card. Look elsewhere if you want anything more then that.My only wish is that I could assign a ZERO star rating. This product will be returned tomorrow."
2,Poor software,"The card itself functions just fine, however if you have windows xp you will be out of luck. The software from ATI has multiple obvious bugs and the task scheduler crashes everytime it is used. The most recently updated software is a beta from July provided as is. If you do buy the card and you have XP try using DScaler and VVCR as your viewing and capturing programs."
2,Pay more money and get something better,"I bought this hoping I'd be able to watch and record TV. This card has several bugs. One, the TV Listings are not accurate and I found myslef using Yahoo TV listings because they were always correct and I didn't want to miss any shows. the ""recording"" part was easy and the video looked OK but not great. However, once in a while the audio ""pops"" and the video ""skips"". Moreover, when I'm watching ""TV"", the audio frequently goes out of sync with the audio. I did a google search and found many other people had the same problem. I updated all of the drivers and changed the sound card and nothing worked. Strangely, if the audio is out of sync and I press the ""record"" button, all recorded video is IN-sync. Anyway, don't buy it. Get something more expesive and save yourself a hassle."
2,Resource conflicts,"I bought the card, plugged it into one of my PCI slots, and installed the software, following the instructions in the manual. I found out, as soon as I tried to run the TV Tuner, that the card had a resource conflict with one of my BIOS extensions. Try after try, I could not get the settings to change. I ended up returning the product, and looking for another TV Tuner card.I'm sure that if I didn't have those resource conflicts, it would have been a great product...documentation was sufficient, the other programs seemed to function great, but because of the serious errors I had, I'm giving this 2 stars."
1,If you run Windows XP - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"If you run Windows XP DO NOT BUY this product. Flat out do not buy this unless you are a massochist. I know what you're thinking, this guy is just some idiot that probably had to call Dell just to setup his first home PC. Consider yourself lucky to have been smart enough to read this review and others like it before wasting your Sunday afternoon trying to get it to work like I did. After spending 7 hours straight downloading drivers from the ATI website then downloading fixes from the Microsoft website, re-installing the product 4 times, after it totally [messed] up my operating system (thank goodness for the XP ""system restore"" ) I finally gave up and will be returning this product. After about the third hour of trying to get this to work, I finally got XP just to properly recognize the new hardware - only to have the application freeze up every time I started the ""TV"" panel.Looks like a cool product, if it only worked."
3,"So-So Dryer, Way too loud!","I am only giving this product 3/5 stars because of how loud it is. In Low setting it is fine but once you turn it to high- Look Out! It is so very loud that it might be damaging to your ears, seriously, having it close to your ears on a daily basis is a concern. I bought this on sale at Target for 16.99 and I will be returning it. My quest for a sufficient Ion Dryer continues. Also, I noticed the dryer left my hair wavy after drying, whereas my previous dryer left my hair straight... I am not sure why or how this would happen, but it something I noticed that I did not like. After using this VS blowdryer I had to bust out the hair straightner (more time spent than I wanted). Anyhow, the dryer works, just not for me. My suggestion is too look elsewhere for a dryer."
2,nothing special,"i previously had a vidal sassoon dryer and loved it. when i decided to upgrade, i chose this dryer. bad idea. it's a decent dryer, but my hair is thick and long and the dryer wasn't powerful enough. i also noticed that the hot setting was hot enough to burn my scalp, but the warm setting wasn't intense enough to dry. i'm returning this product. it's not worth the money."
1,Worthless Product,"Mine just stopped working. I tried everything to get it back, but it just stays quiet. Odd in light of others talking about how noisy it is!"
2,1.5 yrs then Dead,"I had this 1.5 yrs then it died. Next I bought the Vidal Sassoon Answers for fine hair less than a year it shot bright white light out of it and is threatening to start a fire. Answers model did a better job smoothing and shine while it lasted than this model. I had both set to the right ions for fine but not extra fine hair.Your hair dryers do not last. Never again. Burned me twice, and the second time was almost an electrical fire burn not a figure of speech anymore."
1,Scary electrical issues with this model,"Have had this dryer for about 2 years, leave it plugged in. Every few weeks, it makes a loud vibrating electrical sound, very scary. I shut it off, reset it and it still works. Is there a recall on this model? Read online that many others have same problem. No flames or sparks with the thing as other have had, but plan to replace it pronto. Went off again this morning and woke me up! See other site for more on this electrical issue ... Be careful![...]"
1,Nice dryer if it would have kept working,"I wanted to try one of the ionic hairdryers, but since I have fine hair I was hesitant about how it would affect my hair. Having the option to select ionic or not seemed to be a good choice. The hairdyrer itself was fairly lightweight and balanced. I did like the ionic drying - it seemed to make my hair much softer. I did not like the on/off and heat selector buttons...they seemed to get in the way and be much harder to use than the sliding tabs some other dryers have. I would have gotten used to them though, if the dryer had not overheated and quit on my 3rd use. Nothing I did would get it to work again; every time I turned it on it overheated within 5 seconds and quit. So I sent it back and am waiting for one from a different manufacturer."
4,Many diverse applications,"The harmonic oscillator is one of the classic problems that recurs in physics. Partly because the underlying differential equation is one of the simplest non-trivial equations possible. But, and related to this, because it is a problem that can be solved exactly.What the authors have done is gather under one cover a panoply of harmonic oscillator applications in modern physics. Something that is otherwise scattered through various monographs and journal papers. This in itself has merit to those of you who might have wondered how extensively the idea is applied in various branches of physics."
4,Anti Pfunk Pfunk,"A very cool album for anyone digging the Funkadelic or Parliament sound. Fuzzy Haskins played for both bands and this material from 76' and 78' has excellent backing from Bernie Worrell and other Pfunk members. I prefer the 1st albums worth of material better but there are just enough quality tunes on the 2nd album to keep the interest up. The cd mixes blues, rock, and funk for the 1st 10 tracks and has a more later Parliament sound for the tracks 11-18. Overall the sound quality is excellent with good vocals from Fuzzy Haskins. 2 songs from the 76' material do a little Clinton (George) bashing showing the tension that was prevalent in the Pfunk mob back then."
4,okay but george is a better concept artist,"fuzzy was okay but proved he could'nt hold his own this was recorded when fuzzy was getting tired of funkadelic anyway so he tried to make his own tracks before cutting out this ain't bad features lots of the pfunk crew like bernie worrell, tiki, jerome brailey, boogie mosson, glen goins, gary shider, and michael hampton which makes these jams interesting."
3,cheez,"I don't know what the big deal is about fuzzy haskins. There was a little bit of excitement following his tune being used in the gap commerical a few years back. It's a good album, but it's not the funkiest thing I've heard. If you're into heavily produced, keyboard driven space funk, then you'll like it. If you're into more raw, James Brown stuff, it's really not for you."
1,Later chapters not supervised,"I can tell that many of the chapters in this book did not follow the intentions of the REA reviewers. That is, the subject should begin with basic concepts and teach by example. Instead, many of the chapters are arrogant and mix concepts that have not been covered at all in earlier chapters. In addition, the problems in those chapters contain logical errors that indicate that the chapter is nothing but filler."
2,Disappointing,"I found it to be nothing more than a condensed textbook. It's probably OK if you need it to brush up on Calc after a number of years. But, if you need it to clearly explain concepts that your text cannot, it is worthless."
3,Calculus problem solving,Book is what I wanted but the description from the seller said it was a 2002 edition. It is a 1991 revised edition.
5,Step by Step,I have been out of college for 7 years. I began Grad school last quarter. This book gave me the basic steps to relearn and remember Calculus. It takes you through each kind of problem without skipping steps or assuming you already know what you are doing. A big crutch for understanding single and multivariable calculus. -I passed the placement exam and then used the book to assist in other engineering classes.
3,Life of Gandhi,"This book is excellent if you are looking for a good biography of Gandhi. I don't prefer to read about him, but the book was excellent for class."
5,works as advertised,"Once again I proved to myself that having the right tool makes the job much easier. After struggling to correct damaged threads on an automotive O2 sensor, I broke down and ordered the subject metric hand file to get the job done right. Voila, a few minutes of working the threads with the file made life a whole lot better...sensor screwed in without any more fuss. Product quality looks good, so I expect the file to outlast me."
1,Very disappointing,"Even with a system that meets Apples specifications I find Aperture is so slow, it's almost unusable. Unfortunately I bought the academic version of the program, so I won't qualify for upgrades. Wish I'd done more research before purchasing this program.."
2,Misguided,"Night Comes to the Cumberlands is a well intentioned but one sided book that paints, at best, only a partially correct picture of the people of Appalachia. While negative aspects of the society and economy of the region are described in great detail, and with some truth, any positive developments are mentioned in passing, if at all. The result is a work that could have added greatly to the debate on the future of the region, but is instead largely a lament with few positve things to add to the topic. That said, the book is worth reading, but only with the knowledge that it is a very narrow view of a very complicated topic. Much of what the author describes is, in the opinion of many of the citizens of the region, incorrect. Indeed, some natives of the area even feel that the book has had the effect of continuing many of the worst stereotypes of the region, with the result that further growth has been negatively impacted."
4,Night comes to the Cumberlands,"Excellent read. Caudill makes somber history come alive with many anecdotal accounts and direct exchanges with the ""locals"". What an indictment of the coal barons of the time! Easy to see how the book influenced Kennedy and Johnson to try to mitigate poverty in the region. Only criticism is the lack of references.GEM"
5,"Sad, but informative and fascinating","Being a long time resident of Kentucky, I read Caudill's book with keen interest. Although it is nearly five decades old now, I found it to be just as valuable, and no less relevant today, as it was at the time it was written. Much of it is depressing and sad; some of it is humorous; some of it is infuriating; all of it is fascinating. As a lifelong resident of Appalachia (WV, TN, and KY), I found much to help explain 'why things are what they are' (and how they got to be that way) in this part of the country. Some have criticized the book for perpetuating unfavorable stereotypes - I disagree. Caudill does not stereotype Appalachians - he merely explains them. Night Comes To the Cumberlands is a valuable history of the Cumberland Plateau, and a damning account of the brazen exploitation of both its people and the beautiful mountains in which they live."
5,This whole series of books is charming,Meant to be read aloud as a couple perhaps. Makes you want to cook together. And hop on an airplane for Europe!
5,Yeah!,"I really liked this book! Mia, the main character, is so interesting through this novel! At first I was somewhat turned off to the book because all it seemed to focus on was the Prom. However, this is probably one of the more complex books, and possibly my favorite out of the series. We see the love that Michael and Mia share, a close friendship break up (between Lily and Mia... at least for a time) and some other shocking things from Lily. This book was more well-rounded than the others, which made it so interesting. It is an easy read- much like 1-4, I think just about everyone could read it in a couple hours tops. And best of all, it has the happy ending!:)"
1,5 letters: T R A S H,"This book plain reeked if you were over the age of ten. Come on, the people reading these books did not start off liking them because Mia loved asinine junk like the prom and if her boyfriend was going to break up with her. The only good thing in this book was Lilly, and there wasn't even that much of her.You really want to know? just read the first three books and stop there. There's no point in going on if you want a three-dimensional heroine."
4,A book that will win the heart of any girl!,"Things are looking up for Mia Thermopolis: she is the newest member of the school paper,""The Atom"", her completion of freshmen algebra is just around the corner, and she is just about to get a new baby brother or sister. Could things possobly be any better?But Mia has just one wish, to spend any evening with Michael in a tuxedo and a corsage around her wrist, in other words...Mia really REALLY wants to go to the prom. However, Michael doesn't seem to share the same dream, which is the prom. Worse still, a service workers strike (with Lilly and Mia grandmother at the heart of it and on opposite sides) threatens the very existence of this year's prom.Will the strike end in time? Can Michael be persuaded out of his anti-prom views before the prom? And, most importantly, will Mia ever be able to wear her beautiful pink prom dress?This book is a great book for any girl who has ever fallen in love with a boy...or PINK! :)"
3,Something was missing,"I am an adult who loves to read the Princess series. The previous books have all been entertaining, but for some reason, this one is lacking.I think it is the fact that the author makes Mia sound soooooooo whiny and more than just a little needy.The entire book is based on Mia's need to be asked out for the prom, by her new boyfriend Michael.That's fine and some of Mia's writings are hilarious, but there is a not so subtle undertone of neediness in this book that seriously removes from it.Not the best in the series that is for sure."
5,Amazing,"This book is well crafted nad follows true to the seires. Meg Cabot writes yet another spell binding novel. In Princess in Pink, Mia is dealing with not so ordinary problems. She worries about the Prom and about the future of her genovea. She finally has a boyfriend and now all she wants is to go to prom. Her Grandmother and best friedn are feuding and she is trying to pass Algebra. Whats a gril to do. This book is written with witt and it makes you wish you too were a princess."
2,Poor showing by Cabot,"I don't know if it's because Meg Cabot has lost her touch (which may be the reason all of Mia's adventures are becoming predictable and overdone) or what, but I was very disappointed by Cabot's 5th installment in this series. The Princess Diaries initially drew me in because I could believe Mia as a real 14-year-old, but as the series is progressing, Mia seems to be regressing. In Princess in Pink, Mia's search for self-actualization (which at this point has slowed to a snail's pace) seems to entail acting like a sheltered sixth grader and involves a tiresome amount of CAPITAL LETTERS and exclamation points (...). The scenes that used to be fresh and funny have become stale and are bordering on the absurd. Mia needs to begin realizing some of her potential or I'm going to begin self-actualizing myself away from this previously charming, and currently pedantic, series."
3,Disappointed,I am a reader from GOZO (MALTA) me and my friends where waiting eagerly for the fifth book in this great series but we where greatly disappointed because all MIA talks about is PROM PROM PROM PROM PROM PROM PROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????(And we don't even do proms in our country!!!!!!!!!!!)Although there where some exciting parts like:when Lilly goes out with the busboythe seven minutes in heaven gamewhen Boris dropped the globe on his headthe prom itselfwhen her mother gives birth to her little brother Rocky.Is it possible that a human being spend his life writing???!!!
1,FILTHY!!!,"'Princess in Pink'is simply tainted with filth and immodesty. Using young, likeable characters Meg Cabot is creating a terrible example for today's teenagers. These books are written for young girls? Is this how Meg Cabot acted when she was fifteen?!? This book should have a warning label on it:TOTALLY UNAPPROPRIATE!!!!!Moms: Please don't let your children read these books!!!"
2,Meg Cabot's Lost her Touch,"In all of Meg's previous books she has kept the reader drawn to the book throughout the story. This book, Princess in Pink, was unlike her others. It was very repetitive-and lost my attention. During the story there was only one climax and even that was dull. (...) Don't waste your money buying this book-instead rent it from the library because it will be a big disappointment to all Mia fans."
2,A royal dissapointment.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first books in this series starring Mia, the clumsy and honest girl who could think for herself. This novel, however, was a huge dissapointment. If you want to listen to a highschooler whine the prom, getting grounded, and missing her daily make-out session, then congrats, this is a great read for you. As for me, this title made a great addition to my 'literary crap' pile."
1,Would you like some chesse with your whine?,"This book has to be the worst book that I have ever read! I love the first three Princess Darires book. I thought that 4th one had it moments, but this one was the woast. Cabot takes a B plot, like wanting to go to the prom when your boyfriend doesn't, into a 256 page book. Also the whining that she did...lets just say that there was more then one time that I wanted to slap her. She also said ""Why me"" more then once. Are you kidding me? You get to be a heathly teen with good friends, a boyfriend and even a princess. On yeah...you really have a terrible life! Her selfishness also comes through on this book. It wasn't even HER prom, yet she thought it was a good idea to make her boyfriend go by tricking him. I can only hope that the books get better then this. To me it just seemed like Meg wanted 10 books in the series...and had to make something out of nothing."
5,This is a great book!,"Being one of the only books I've ever actually laughed out loud during, The Princess Diaries Volume 5 is hilarious, enjoyable, and well written. I am genuinly impressed by Meg Cabot's ability to portray a teenager, judging by the fact that I am one myself. I never read teen series books, but this truly is different. The Princess Diaries is truly entertaining, and I haven't regretted reading it. Although the horrible covers may be deceiving, these books are definitely fun and flow very well. I now own every book in the series, and I read them over again and again. The Princess Diaries are definitely the kind of book that you can read again and still enjoy. Read this series!"
3,3 and a half stars,"This was a great movie. It was based on a true story about a women who decided to get an abortion because there was something wrong with her baby. This was before abortion was legal and when word got out it caused quite a scandal, and the hospital couldn't do the abortion anymore (her doctor had recommended it, and the hospital had already done other abortions- I found it interesting that doctors and hospitals found ways to get around the abortion laws to do abortions before they were legal)This movie was very emotional, as well a interesting and important historically.I only wish it was out in dvd- and maybe with a documentary about what really happened, and about the history of abortions, and so on as the extras.I highly recomend this movie."
1,I was expecting something much more...,"Being fascinated with werewolves and folklore, I was excited to see this book after searching the shelves for something to curb my boredom.Well, I was disatisfied with this whole book, save the few stories about werewolf tales in France and Britain.The author used one of her backup resources from Wikipedia, which is a pathetic way to cite from a book, since any old schmo can revise the information at any time.This also seems a bit biased on opinion, and seems to encourage that werewolves exist on earth. They don't even mention anything about genetics or the fact that physical shapeshifting is anatomically impossible, but focus on ""magic"" shifting instead.I'm only giving it one star for the neat cover."
4,A Neglected Band,"Best understood as the British answer to Alice Cooper. SAHB shares a lot in common with those guys from Detroit -- showmanship, a flamboyant lead singer, Tin Pan Alley influences, and, best of all, a nice, uncomplicated reliance on heavy riffs to power the sound. This and Live (taken from a 1975 show) has good versions of all their best songs -- ""Faith Healer"", ""Framed"", ""Vambo"", ""Tomahawk Kid"", ""Temptation of St. Antony""-- and taken together is all you really need."
5,Just what was ordered,"I ordered several different seasons and my son loves them all. He could stream them on the internet, but he says he prefers watching on a larger screen."
4,Funimation Finally Speeding things Up!!!!!,"I'm glad to see that this is coming out right behind season six! But, why piccolo on the cover???? They should have went with gohan at SSJ 2 as a teen. But, this saga is really just a filler until Buu is released. Although Goku and Vegeta gives us funny moments throughout the tournament and up to babidi's spaceship! Great Saga but not better the Fusion and Kid Buu! Hurry Up Funimation!"
4,DBZ Junkie,"I am a junkie for DBZ so if there is any problems with the title, I can't honestly write one. Shipping of the product was within time so everything for me was good."
5,Season Seven Rewiew,"Great sagas. The saiyanman saga is a perfect for summerizing what has happened in the last 7 years as well as show where all the characters are. And the fights in the other world tournament are awesome. THe saga is also the first with Goten. As well as kid trunks. And those 2 are hilarious. And the world tournament saga sets up the story for the grand finale. essential in all collections.Piccolo definately deserves this cover. He is one of the most dynamic characters in the epic. Only second to Vegeta. He killed Goku in the first saga and then trained Gohan to save the world. Then he died for Gohan. Then on Namek, he stepped in when the Gohan and the others were beat. THen he fused with Kami to destroy 17 and prevent cell reaching his perfect form, He watches over the boys and teaches them the fusion dance, and ultimately chooses to go to hell to help goku escape."
4,Epic,"Hey everyone, if you like DBZ just as much as i do, then you'll love this DVD just as much as the other Seasons. In this particular season set of coures the season starts kinda boring with the Sayaman saga but comes to life as soon as Gohan starts training Videl."
5,great season,"This was a gift, but what I was told he has enjoyed this season of Dragon Ball very much. It was a hit or should I say a home run."
3,Some information is outdated,"I enjoyed reading this book, and I love all the pictures, but some important information is outdated. For example, the book suggests over and over that you give your parakeet gravel to help with digestion, but this is a big no-no. A more recent book would explain the dangers of this practice, and inform the reader to steer clear of gravel and grit, as well as sandpaper perches (which can hurt and injure your bird's poor little feet).Much of the information is very helpful, and again, the pictures are wonderful, but I would suggest a more current book to anyone who is looking for accurate information on the feeding and care of your parakeet. If I had noticed the publishing date of this book (English version was first published in 1986) I would have passed on it."
1,Hopeless is right,"I picked up this book because I think the author's The Body in the Volvo is one of the best mysteries ever. I was hugely disappointed in this book. I admit that my disappointment is because I require that people investigating a murder actually take some sensible precautions. After all, sooner or later you're likely to run into the murderer, so it's best to be prepared. The main character, Jane da Silva, doesn't think along these lines at all. She arranges to meet with someone who may know something, and I could see there was going to be trouble, but Jane doesn't suspect a thing. Once at his place she gets knocked unconscious, and upon awakening she does some more stupid things: she doesn't want to go to the hospital or tell the police what it was all about.That was enough for me. I stopped reading. If you don't mind this kind of thing, go ahead and read it."
4,Princess Tricycle,This is the cutest thing I really like the looks of it. So far I am really pleased with my purchase it was simple to put together and rides nicely for my small child. The only negative is the plastic bin where you can put your toys broke away from frame because my daughter steps on this piece to get onto seat if you are careful with that it will work fine.
2,Your usual Ram Oren...,"Ram Oren always had a knack of catching the latest & most popular Israeli catch phrases & what's on the collective Israeli mind as reflected in the news (both TV & written).Unfortunately, he often doesn't know what's behind those phrases & situations. Having some computer work background, it was obvious Mr. Oren was spewing out catch phrases he had heard somewhere, but had no idea whatsoever of what he was saying. I do hope that his journalism background has made the parts dealing with journalism more accurate.Then why 2 stars? If you want something light & fluffy to read to pass the time, this is the book for you."
4,Educational experience...but interesting,"This book offers some good insights into police work from a veteran officer. It recovers a lot of things you get in the academy as well as on-the-job experience. It also goes into history, police equipment, and situations you are likely to find on the job. There was not excitement from cover to cover, but overall it was so interesting I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book for veteran officers and especially for those considering a job in law enforcement."
1,Maggi Curry Noodles,"I grew up in Malaysia and ate Maggi curry noodles when I was growing up. Things must have changed a lot because I don't remember seeing ""Milk"" as one of the ingredients. As I am lactose intolerant now, I was very disappointed with this. So for those of you who do not do dairy, please note."
4,Great intervju although...,it's a bit annoying to hear the sound of the bad music in the backround. They say a few funny things and I think it's worth buying!
2,Not worth it,"I was dissapointed by this CD. I've heard better radio interviews with Green Day. I don't feel like this CD represents the band well, or is worth buying"
5,this is very cool if you are a greenday fan,this is a unique look into the into the minds of the best punk band of the 90's
5,great,"this is a great piece of hardware, it has great tv capture with a great resolution. it is a cinch to install and very user friendly. i totally recommend this over the PCI card tuner.BUY IT!"
3,"stripped-down software, good basic tv functionality","I bought this USB version because I liked the ALL-IN-RADEON card, but I'm disappointed that the software out of the box doesn't have an 'on-demand' feature that my Radeon does (pausing live tv), and no video compression available for tv recording (no mpeg or mpeg2). This makes recording on a laptop inflexible (HUGE files).PROS: It's pretty cool to have tv on a laptop! Basic tv functionality is good. Guide+ works well just as on my Radeon.Curiously, on my Radeon, it shows ""ATI TV v.7.1"" on my Radeon, and ""ATI TV v.7.3"" on my TV Wonder USB. I hope there's a previous version with the features I'm looking for (or a downloadable update)."
2,Had to send it back,"I could not get it to work properly under Windows XP, even after downloading XP drivers from ATI's website. One problem was that everytime I pluged it into my laptop, I had to reboot the comptuer, which it should not have had to do. However, the reason I sent it back was that the sound would go out after a few minuets, and I would have to change channels to get the sound back. The picture quality is also much worse than a tv tuner that goes into a PCI slot, which is expect because USB cables cannot transfer as much data as PCI cards.If you have a desktop, I would recomend a PCI tv tuner or one that directly connects to the monitor and does not need a computer to work.It is possible that the sound and USB problems were because of XP compatablity issues. However, I gave this two stars because ATI does advertise it as XP compatable, and the poor picture quality was because of the tuner, not the computer."
1,Buggy stuff,Though the picture is very good considering that it's USB tunerI wasn't able to make capture working stable in my XP Pro.Here are number of other bugs with sheduler also.Synchronisation between audio and video capture completelyabsent. Software package is weak. No remote. They still have nocompleted XP software only betta version.If you have XP - choose another tuner.
2,could not get it to work,"no matter what i did i could not get it to work on my toshiba laptop (512m, 850mhz p3) running xp-home.actually the video capture was fine, but the tuner would not deliver a clear picture dispite having the cable company supply it a line directly from the pole (ie:a new cable directly from the source itself).an considering a standard video capture device...just be careful./pastor harry/"
1,"Lots of trouble to install, still no sound","I tried to install this on my old computer running Win98 and it said that my graphics card was incompatible. When I got my new machine, running win2000, I tried again.The first problem was that I had to uninstall the multimedia drivers that were already installed for my ATI video card. There was no error message telling me this, the install just bombed and I had to take a guess.I finally got it to work with video but there is no sound. I wish I had researched this before I bought the card, because now I'm finding out that many others have had the same problem.To summarize, the card is garbage."
2,Had to send it back,"I could not get it to work properly under Windows XP, even after downloading XP drivers from ATI's website. On problem was that everytime I pluged it into my laptop, I had to reboot the comptuer, which it should not have had to do. However, the reason I sent it back was that the sound would go out after a few minuets, and I would have to change channels to get the sound back.

However, I gave this two stars because ATI does advertise it as XP compatable, and the poor picture quality was because of the tuner, not the computer."
3,Video quality suffers w/ USB... Poor driver support from ATI,"PROS: Ease of installation, portable.CONS: USB tv tuners tend to have worse picture quality than PCI tuners. Mono sound (no stereo). ATI STILL has not released drivers for WinXP. They are notorious for their lousy driver support... Get with it ATI!!!"
3,Does not support Windows NT!,"I recently bought this device to use on my laptop, but discovered it does not support Windows NT. I haven't used it yet as a result. The device is just the right size and I think it will work out well once I switch to Windows XP. I plan to use it on my sailboat, where space and power are prime concerns."
4,Good Background Information,"This book is a good resource for those who want to find out more about Kosher products. More information on the practical, day-to-day issues of keeping Kosher would have been helpful. But the book has a lot of good information overall."
4,Great anecdotal look into baseball,"As a result of hearing Bill Littlefield interviewed on the radio, I decided to buy this book as a gift for my son's little league coach. It looked so delightful that I couldn't resist reading it before I gave it to him. The book includes amusing and interesting anecdotes on a large variety of topics relating to baseball. Between the writing and the terrific photographs, Baseball Days keeps one's interest throughout."
3,Way better than the movie...,"I caught most of the movie, enough to make me curious about the source material. The movie seems very melodramatic and sad. The book is more humorous, sometimes reminding me of Tom Robbins' novels, although not quite so whimsical. I liked the ride, but I'm not sure I enjoyed the destination. The heroine's decision at the end seemed very selfish, in a way, but it would be giving away the plot to explain why I felt that way."
5,:),"Jade Carrington was not left with much choice when one of the King's men attacked her. She knew the only way to defend herself was to kill her attacker. Now Jade must face her punishment. She was to be auctioned as a slave.Matthew Hunter knew that he would pay whatever it took to win Jade. Unfortunately, Matt was not the only one that wanted Jade. The Frenchman that Matt outbid had every intention of having Jade whether he won the auction or not. Matt and Jade rode deep into the wilderness where they not only had to stay hidden from the Frenchman, but also from the Indians who were planning an attack of the white people.Matt and Jade face many dangers as the struggle to survive in the wilderness and at the hands of the enemies. Their strength, honor, and love get them through the worst. The story of Matt and Jade is about survival and so much more. The danger keeps you on edge from page to page. This is a book I do not hesitate to recommend."
5,ABSOLUTELY MOVING!,"I have read (11) books in this series. This one People of the Lakes actually made me cry. Not only do they give us the most amazing history of these great people but the characters have so much depth to them. I cannot remember reading a book of where people were willing to sacrifice their lives for another and for the most basic reason of love. The Gears have written a beautiful history for people to enjoy and every book I have read has wonderful characters and always has a great plot. They leave nothing for you to wonder about later. All of their books have a more than satisfying ending and as I said before with this particular book leave you with a wonderful feeling of how great it is for people who care about others besides themselves. Anyone who has not read any of their books is causing themselves to miss many hours of wonder, adventure and history."
5,Written for the poetic minded person. Not just another story,"Exciting, poetic, and with a hint of mystery and intuitive anticipation"
2,Awful,Call me a party-pooper but I fail to see what is so wonderfull about this book. It was a chore to read.
5,mystical and magical adventure!,"Kudos to the gears for writing such magical novel! We are know from history classes what happened in ancient greece and Rome and medieval europe BUT we don't know what happened in our country a thousand years ago but thanks to the Gears and their considerable storytelling abilities we can imagined what happened in this country.This novel has scenes of eerie mysticism, romance suspenseful adventure and witty dialogue to create a novel with memorable characters like black skull, deadly warrior with a painful past, feisty Pearl and mysterious sorcerer midget named the Tall Man and the hunt for the sinister mask was gripping! Two thumbs up for this novel!"
2,Great if you want to read 10 pages of material stretched to 300.,"A very average book. The main point in the book is that you have to be more assertive and quit downplaying your achievements. The rest is just material copied straight from any other self help book. There are at least 50 pages of just blank lines that you could buy a legal pad or steal some paper from the library's printer.Don't buy this book, there are much better self-help books out there."
1,Claims won't hold water!,"Purchased this item for daughter 4 months ago, in the hopes of avoiding hair damage from separate drying and straightening processes. Unfortunately, the product never lived up to its claims. She never got a truly smooth straightening starting with damp or dry hair. In fact, when used as directed on damp hair, the coating started peeling off the plates, and sizzled some of her hair. She now uses a Revlon Ceramic straightener that produces a beautifully sleek result for far less money. My advice is to stay away from this one."
4,Perfumed Garden,"Sorry, I have not finished reading the book yet, but onto the page I am presently, it is a good read for those who want to improve on their love relationship"
5,really a comprehensive manual,"Loved it! It is really ""comprehensive"" as the title indicated. It also comes with many useful tables. A useful tool if you are doing research on the Abhidhamma."
2,It's a dud!,"I bought two Williams-Somona ""Salads,"" one was by Georgeanne Brennan and the other was by Emanuela Prinetti. The first one was great. This one was a dud! It divided the salads into appetizers, main course, accompaniments and fruit salads. I would have liked a book on ones that were familiar and exotic or different. It needed arugula, fennel, raw steak, endive, watercress and radicchio throughout. I am not satisfied."
1,don't buy this book,"There was absolutely nothing hear that gave strategies and/or secrets to Panzer General 3D Assault! The instruction manual that comes w/this game comes w/ a better strategy plan for the tutorial, than any of the strategies listed here. Most strategies are one to three paragraphs long!! Hardly any info. for you to use. Don't buy this book, if you really want it, email me, and I sell you my copy for a buck! Thats about how much its worth! If I could rate this book a minus 1, it still would be over-rated!"
5,Book has good information,This book has alot of information on chameleons.I think it is one of the better ones offered here.
1,What a disappointment!,"Where do I begin? This video seemed very sophmoric - the ""hosts"" appeared to be ad libbing the whole way through this ""documentary."" I didn't get a real ""feel"" of Seattle, either. This video, if anything, inspires me NOT to travel there (but I'm going anyway 'cause I booked my flights already!) . I recommend the ""Step One"" video series if you'd like to catch a glimpse of Seattle's ambiance."
5,El relampago del llano,"Uno de los interpretes mas representativos de nuestra querida Venezuela, el cual ha tracendido mas alla de las fronteras del continente americano; poseedor de una lirica fuera de lo comun,que con caricias lacerantes, relata la cruda realidad del pueblo. Junto con Ali Primera, aunque de filosofia 180 grados diferente; representan la mas pura escensia del venezolano de ayer, de hoy y de siempre."
5,The best of Venezuela...,"I was not a big fan of this music when I was back home, but then I realised that is only when you're away that you appreciate what belongs to your culture. This music is made those of us who are away from home as it reminds you that you belong somewhere... THE best place to live, and that's my country, Venezuela. And I'm proud of it."
1,Not worth the money,"This thing is a piece of junk... when I first got it, the screw holding the handle together stripped its thread, meaning it would fold up unless I supported it. Just today, after 2-3 years of service, it stopped, emitted a blue spark, and died. I think I only paid $20 for it, but you're better off spending a bit more for something that will last."
2,Seemed nice at first,"This isn't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling. However, the folding handle did eventually break and I had to modify it to hold it together. I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand. If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position. Personally, I can't wait to find her a better one so I can tear this one apart for more interesting things. On the upside, after fixing the handle, it has worked without any real problems for 6 months."
1,dorenerobin,The off-on switch on this product is very difficlut to use. I am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands.
4,A pretty decent travel dryer,"I was looking for a dryer to use for after swimming and came across this one. I already own a panasonic ionic dryer so I was looking for something preferrably smaller to carry to the locker room to use after swimming. The size of this dryer is just right for my bag. The arm is bendable so that is does not take up more space lengthwise. I like this dryer because it is ionic and that it dries my hair up really fast after washing my hair. My hair is pretty silky afterward too. This is overall a good travel size dryer. The only complaint that I have is the switch..sometimes it is rather difficult to switch it off after drying my hair. The dryer has a seasaw-like switch with the OFF in the middle, with the LOW setting above and the HIGH setting below. Therefore, too much pressure put on the switch can push the switch to either above or below and NOT the middle which is to switch it OFF. Otherwise, a good buy."
1,Very poor quality,"When I first received this dryer, I thought it was the greatest one I had ever tried. It was amazingly effective and conveniently sized. However, after only two weeks of daily use it now only blows cold air. Since I have long, thick hair, a dryer that does not blow hot air is completely ineffective and useless. I am amazed at how quickly this dryer wore out on me and am disappointed. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone, unless you like to style with cool air."
2,I wish I could rave...,"I love to rave about good products...this is not one of them.Regardless of those defending the rocker switch, it is pathetic. It is unnecessarily difficult to operate.The quality of this hair dryer is poor. It will most likely break in the first year of use. I was surprised of this in that Vidal Sassoon products are typically good, in my experience.I purchased this hair dryer last Christmas as a gift for my wife, and had to purchase a new one again (different model) this year."
4,"Good hair dryer, not so compact","I purchased this hair dryer particularly for travel, to be disappointed that it was not so compact as I wanted it to be. I have several mini hair dryers which are not so powerful, so I was hoping to find one that are both powerful and compact. But I gave 4 stars because it was actually a good hair dryer, working like a full size hair dryer, for me it is a bit bulky for travel."
2,shaggy dog story,"The book held my interest for quite sometime but it became more and more entangled with way too much verbage. The characters were not well defined and seemed to change their personalites at the writers whim. The ending was riduculous. It didn't not fit what had gone on before. I felt as though the aurthor had gotten tired of writing (which he should have) and just came up with something to get it over with. Left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I really enjoyed Adrenalin , Last Chance and Last Minute Doesn't seem like the same writer."
5,Don't read this in the dark!,"Jordan Poteet is trying very hard to fit into his real father's family. But these people are just plain odd! Deep, dark family secrets, murder and fear on an isolated island, the consequences of looking into a past perhaps better left alone--this is not just a murder mystery. This one is just plain scarey!Read it with a trusted friend, but most definitely read it."
5,JZW,"This is a wonderful example of everything all rolled up in one -mystery-comedy-love, all in one neat little book! Can't wait until the next installment!"
1,Loved the series until,"this book.In the series of 4 books, Jordan Poteet returns from a good job in Boston to small town Texas because his mother has Alzheimers. His sister needs help with her.The first three books follow Jordan as he becomes involved in various mysteries. They are fun to read even if Jordan himself is often not the most likable character around.This book wasn't even close to the first three. It was dark, depressing, and the ending was absolutely the worst. Don't look for happily ever after here, folks.For Kindle readers, there were many typos which made reading it that much more difficult. In fact, the only reason I did finish it was that I had invested time in reading the first three and wanted to know how it all ended. I should have stopped while I was ahead."
2,Dabo falls off,"A typical problem with new jacks who came off at first like Dabo did on his first release with Platium Tongue is keeping up with that standard. This is Dabo's dilemna. Sure the CD starts rough enough with an ill futuristic gangster movie type of theme, ends with the same beat track but little jewels are in this package. Most tracks sound similar; the vocals as well as the beats. Not without any flavor this cd comes off sounding like a Japanese Guru from Gangstarr produced by the Neptunes type of thing. If you really wanna feel Dabo pick up his first cd, when he was hungrier and showed more variety."
4,A Great Book...,This is a really good book because it tells you how and where to catch all 250 Pokemon! It also says all the attacks each Pokemon acn learn! I liked it because it has pictures for all the Pokemon and it was really fun going through and looking at them. The breeding section came in really handy and I now have some Really good Pokemon on my game. This is one of the best books I've read and I would recomend it to anyone interested in Pokemon!
3,Its ok,"Years after we order this the book fell apart, We still have all the pages in plastic bags but its so out of date we not sure if we will ever replace it"
4,needed more off 1st two Blondie albums,"Titled the ""Complete Picture"" so I'll give her a pass for including solo stuff on this much of which is duff.The Blondie tracks are great. I just wanted more of those.How ""Detroit 442"" did not make this is beyond me as that was Debbie Harry at her sexiest and rockingest, if you've seen the video (YouTube it)."
1,Spendy Pepcid,"I allowed panic to set in when I couldn't find then in my drug stores, and bought 25 tablets for $46 and then, the next day, found them at Costco 100 tablets for $24.00. My Bad!"
2,way overrated,"This is a classic of poker literature, it's true, but I think it's overrated and ranks way down the list of essentials. There are at least 20 other poker books I would recommend before it. The problem is that applying the book's concepts is really a very nebulous business."
5,soft and cozy,This is a great mat. It fit our crate perfect. I love the color. It is so soft and our dogs like the raised lip. It washes up nicely too. Very happy with it.
2,not scratch resistant,I bought this so my dog's kennel would be more comfy. Unfortunately my dog is a scratcher and she had the middle of this bed torn up in a day.
3,Okay Pet Bed,"We purchased this pet bed for our german shepherd. It fits the crate nicely, but is not quite as plush as I would have thought. Also, the bolster is not as big as I initially thought it would be. Our dog likes to prop his head up and he folds the bed in half to have the elevation he wants for resting. All in all the pet bed is okay for the price."
4,Great Price,The quality for the price was excellent. This is the third crate bed that I have purchased. The dog loves.
2,A lot thinner than it looks,"It looked thick in the picture, but the bottom of this has no padding at all, my greyhound won't even lay on it. waste of money."
3,"A satisfactory mat, but not what I anticipated","The photo gave me the impression of significant sides to this crate mat. In reality, the mat is actually flat. Might be okay for an indoor dog (on a carpeted floor, maybe?), but I bought anticipating that this would be a gift for an outdoor dog. This is a well constructed product, but not suited for our needs."
5,"Immerse yourself in a new world - prepare to get ""possessed""","In this series of books Hamilton ceates a unique cosmos of worlds, cultures, aliens, and characters. All without forgetting he has to first entertain and engage his reader. Don't look for deep meaning or some ""read between the lines"" insight - this is a fun romp through the galaxy. Much like Dune, a new world is created complete with technology, aliens, cultures and language. Unlike Dune, you don't need an appendix to keep up with the action. Don't get the first book(s) (Reality Dysfunction 1 & 2) without buying The Neutronium Alchemist 1 & 2. You won't forgive yourself. Can't wait for the conclusion."
2,Way too drawn-out; The series should have been one book!,"Peter Hamilton would have written a great book if his entire saga would start and end in one book. As it is, the majority of things are just a rehash of one of the previous books. Skip this one!"
1,It's Not Worth It,Volume 4 of a six volume series. See series review on the Reality Dysfunction: Emergence page.
5,"Outstanding, One of the best book's (Book) I have read","I ordered the first book just to try Hamilton, But once I had read it I just had to get the others. Only problem is now I have to wait to 1999 to read the last book - aaaargh. Hamilton may well be one of the best authors I have ever read, lets hope the ""The Naked God"" is as good, or dare I say it better than the others."
5,An epic,"Great book and realistic characters but i recommend reading all the books in sequence without reading books in between. I get lost sometimes when the minor charecters show back up between books. Most characters are three dimensional (All major ones are as our the reoccuring ones, cept the lackeys got have them in this kind of epic) One of the few science fiction stories i've read that the space battles are 3D. And it looks at combining spirituality with science and what is it that makes us.. us."
5,a 'must read' for parents with a special needs child....,"WOW........ talk about bringing back the memories, of when Sarah was 'gifted to us' some thirty (30) years ago.....!!! What a blessing she has been and continues to be, to EVERYONE she meets. Just like Johnny was for the Stallings' family, for his forty-six (46) years. I often times say........ 'God has never made a mistake, and He certainly didn't when He created Sarah for us'....... Thank you, Lord....!!!"
4,A Fond Memory,"I had been looking for this book since hearing Coach Stallings speak at our Boy Scout Luncheon last year. I was aware of his parenting of a child with Down Syndrome and having employed a young girl with this disability, I could relate somewhat to the difficulties Coach and his wife encountered.It is an inspiring story of love and devotion for your children, regardless of their capabilities. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,outdated new copy,"the subject of this heartwarming story has passed away and coach has written an addition to the book. since i am sending the copy i bought to a friend who has a son with downs, i hoped that an updated version would have been sent."
3,Another Season,I live in alabama and even kind of like alabama football so when we had to read it for summer reading i thought i would like it...i absolutly hated it!!! You could so tell it wasn't written by a pro writer i mean it jumped around from different dates and although i loved how inspirational it was with johnny gene stallings seemed kind of self centered and every time the family was happy moved. i hated how there was no time line and years would pass and then he would go every minute of the next day. i thought it was good how they were so religous and i liked reading it but it is not a book i would really reccomend to anybody just because there are more inspirational books and just better books!! Luv Ya!!
4,Just challenging enough,This puzzle was a fun trip down memory lane for two former farm kids. It was challenging enough to keep us occupied for several days.
4,Very cute,This book is adorable and very funny. I would recommend any of the pigeon books. They crack my 5 year old nephew up and I have to admit to chuckling myself when I read them.
5,The Reviewer Finds a Good Book,"Poor pigeon finds a hot dog, which he is very excited to eat. Unfortunately, a pesky little duckling scoots right up to him and starts asking all kinds of questions, which the pigeon believes are meant to get him to give up his hot dog.As with all the pigeon books, this one was a hit with both my son and me. We chuckled our way through it, and my son now scoots his way around our kitchen while quoting ""scooty, scoot, scoot.""My son had some questions about the characters' motivations; for example, why does the pigeon get so upset about the duckling asking question? This led into to a good discussion about ownership, begging, and sharing.Overall: a good, entertaining read with great discussion potential for younger readers."
5,Pigeon is great,Wonderful book! We discovered the pigeon series recently and my son loves them. It's a great read!
5,BEST PreK-Grade2 book series EVER!!!,"It was love at first sight. After finding Mo Willems' ""Don't Let the Pigeon Ride the Bus,"" my son was hooked. He couldn't wait to read it by himself.The name Mo Willems doesn't ring a bell? He is a 6 time emmy award winner for his work as a scriptwriter and filmmaker at PBS' Sesame Street. And he head-wrote the first four seasons of Codename: Kids Next Door.""The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog"" lovingly teaches children to laugh at themselves and to be good role models. I highly recommend purchasing the whole series. We can't wait for the next book!Update 7/8/12: My son still loves Mo Willems' Pigeon books after all these years."
5,Love it!,All I have to say is my daughter (4) loves this book and so do I. The simple pictures are full of expression and the story is so funny we laugh every time. Highly recommend it.
5,My child LOVES Mo Willems' books,"This is my four year old son's favorite book. We picked it up at the library, then, spent the next two weeks reading it at least 10 times a day.It has a simple, yet engaging story and cute pictures. The dialogue is entertaining (my child insisted that we act it out, like a play), and you will never think of a hot dog the same way again. Anything that makes my child laugh the way he did while listening to ""The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog"" is a winner, to me. It has also encouraged him to try new foods--we now joke around about how different things taste, coming up with ridiculous analogies or descriptions, enticing him to sample ""the goods.""This book has made us fans of Mo Willems' work. We have since read several of his other books and enjoyed each of them, as well."
5,A pigeon with personality,"We fell in love with the pigeon in ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus,"" and now we love the duckling, too. This book doesn't encourage as much interaction as the first, but the lesson of sharing it teaches is long-lasting.There are just a handful of books that toddlers and parents enjoy enough to read every night -- sometimes three or four times. This is at the top of that list."
3,Disappointed,"I love the author's ""Knuffle Bunny"" and the reviews of the book were good. But I was really disappointed with it. The book seems to be written for young children with it's simple drawings and large type. But it uses long multi-syllabic words like ""celebration"" and ""sensation,"" defeating the reading ability of my young kids."
2,Hard to 'read',"This is one of those books that tells a story with just the pictures. If you have a small child, you are 'explaining' the pictures and adding these words in that is all dialog. At 8pm, I don't want to make up a story around a book. I want to read a book to my kid.Although the illustrations are cute, I still wish there was more narrative."
4,Nobody likes this book but me and the kid...,I think its amusing and the kid listens to the story for a few minutes. Maybe nobody gets it but me.
5,Great read,We have several off these books my 3 year old loves them and asks to read them all day long. Great story.
1,My son and I didn't like this book.,I was surprised by all the great reviews associated with this book and The Don't Let the Pigeon Drive The Bus (we bought both) book. My 3 year old son was between bored and confused when reading it. I didn't much care for it either. The Pigeon is pretty rude and an obnoxious loud-mouth. I don't think this is an appropriate book for a 2 year old--maybe Kindergarten-up.
3,not as good as the stay up late one,"good series, awesome illustrations, just not quite as solid as the other one we have, the ""don't let the pigeon stay up late"" book, which our son LOOOOVES.but maybe hell like it a little more as he gets older. ?"
2,A one joke joke book,"My daughter got this book in kindergarten through a Scholastic book order. She liked it herself, but I couldn't stand it. I get that it's supposed to mirror some classic comedy sketch, but the characters are obnoxious, it demonstrates negative behavior, it's less of a story than a brief joke, and it's just plain not funny. I read it twice to her before I just refused to read it any more. There are much better books out there for kids this age, including the author's Knuffle Bunny titles."
5,What does a hot dog taste like?,"This is another story starring our friend pigeon. This time he finds a hot dog. What a great treat. Unfortunately, he can't fully enjoy it because of a pesky duckling. This duckling asks him all kinds of questions about the hot dog. This causes the pigeon much frustration as all he wants to do is eat the hot dog. After much deliberation and aggrivation, it is decided that the pigeon and the duckling could share the hot dog, thus ending the conflict and making both parties happy. A great, simple introduction to the concept of sharing and acceptance."
5,Howdy Cowboy!,"My family and I had a lot of fun playing this card game. It was unlike any other game that we own. The game plays quickly, so if you have someone in your group that hates long, drawn-out board games, this is perfect. Even if someone is ""shot to death"", they won't have to wait too long before you can begin another game. We found that the more people that could play (up to seven), the better. We look forward to purchasing the expansion pack to try out new characters."
4,Such a fun cardgame!,"This is a clever and very fun card game. The only reason I gave it a four is because when a character dies that player is out of the game entirely. Even though in the expansion there is a card that brings a player back to life but, only for one turn. Plus its only in the expansion pack. But anyway, unless you are out very early in the game which can happen, its very fun."
5,I don't do titles,"This is the only board/card game that I've extensively play and still like. I gave away the set that I had, but I'd buy it again, if I could find enough people to play the darn thing.I won't bore you with details such as the rules of the game or why I like it, but I would like to mention that there should be more board games that cater to those needing entertainment. It seems that most are created as intellectual endeavors (not why I play games) or mindless pastimes (usually not why I play games). The most interesting kind of games, of which Bang! is a good example, is social games. The kind that you can use to make new friends or get more out of your old ones (until you trade them in for store credit).Yeah it's terribly educational. When I lost the English version of the rules, I had to learn Italian just to be able to play the game again.It's about as durable as you'd expect something made of paper to be."
2,"tediously detailed with a meandering storyline, laborious to read","This book is too long and eventually the reader grows weary of the tedious pace. The subject matter is interesting, however, the author does not bring the characters to life nor engage the audience. Eventually one becomes indifferent to the outcome feeling worn down with endless debate about the morality of the criminals. This author provides absolutely no comic relief in hundreds of pages of writing. The book does have educational value and well it should because reading it is work."
2,allergen be gone,"I own a 3 year old version of this vac, what I received was a much used version that looked 3 years older then my vac, everything was scratched, chrome lettering was scratched off and it really looked used, not re-manufactured. While it may work and perform, very disappointed with Allergen Be Gone, won't order any else from them."
2,"great suction, poor build quality","Bought this and within 4 months of relatively light use, went through 2 belts and the self-propelled mechanism keeps slipping up and down. Very disappointed."
2,Heavy weight but good vacuum,"I bought this based on the positive reviews. The remanufactured model is working well and saves significant money. The vacuum itself has good suction and excellent cleaning. HOWEVER, it is really really heavy and that prevents us from using it much. No one had seemingly mentioned the weight but it is not for the faint of heart. Back problems would prevent you from using it."
1,BELTS BRAKE< SMOKES LIKE CRAZY>No Response from seller,Ok So I have had this vacuum cleaner for a little over a month I have used it maybe 7 times. Every time I have used this it smokes I have very low carpet and have it set on the medium height. Today I started vacuuming and it was fine for a moment then the roller quit working and the machine started smoking ALOT. I am very disappointed that my belt has broke. I don't understand the whole smoking every-time I vacuum. Have replaced belts same thing...Contacted seller no response....I strongly believe in Hoover but if this has been re-manufactured and there is still a problem it needs to be taken care of.....I guess I will have to go back to my good old faithful Kenmore canister that I have had for over 9 years.....I don't usually write reviews...but lets see if Amazon publishes this...they took that last review of mine off...Time to get Honest....
4,U6401-9RM after a few years of use.,"For the price, works great.Buy a bag of extra belts, when they are ""glazed"", the machine is hard to move. Put a new one in every year, even if it works ok.Go out on eBay and buy a case of bags, because they do not hold much.Buy extra rocker switches for the power on/off because they do not last long. Very easy to replace - no soldering or wire nuts required. Remove 6 screws for access.The unit is light & easy to operate otherwise. Nice that you do not get dust in your face when operating :-)"
2,Attachments don't all fit on the vacuum,"The vacuum looked almost new and worked right out of the box. However, the wands were too short to fit on the vacuum, so I will have to store them somewhere else and hope, they won't get lost. Like others have mentioned, the hose is too short to be useful. The vacuum is almost impossible to move when not plugged in and on self propel. If you have back problems, stay away! This vacuum is very heavy!Otherwise, the suction is very good but it is louder than my old vaccum (Bissell)."
3,Lots of problems,"We purchased a remanufactured unit: the plastic switch to adjust from carpet to bare floors broke immediately. We returned it, and the next one worked pretty well for a while, but now the brush unit stopped working on carpeted floors even after replacing the belt. The hose is too short. The best part is the self-propelled feature and it does pretty well suctioning pet hair."
3,Came in broken,"Unfortunately the unit I received came in needing a new brush as the one that it came with kept causing belts to come off or break. After a trip to the warranty service location nearest my home, it now works fine. Other than that, it looks and runs like a new one. Just sort of a hassle to have to take a newly purchased vacuum in for repair before I could use it."
3,Love God's Dream for Us,"While I do not always agree with Bishop TuTu's religious views, I find his narrative absolutely inclusive of all views and I loved reading this book. The story of liberation from South African Apartheid, the message to love one's enemies, the message of God's Love for all of us, is worth reading."
4,Relieved.,"The item arrived before Amazon had even marked it as shipped. The item is just as it was described. A perfect gift for Nana, my son said--which the fragrance is, soft, warm and powdery, like a lady."
5,Should be required reading for anyone in private practice,"I highly recommend this book to all the clients of my billing service; in fact, I gave copies for Christmas one year! Therapists are launched into private practice with no clue about how to deal with insurance companies or managed care. Suddenly they have to learn (usually the hard way) how to fill out treatment plans and work with case managers. Susan Frager maps out this new world in a clear fashion, and in language familiar to the clinician."
2,Cheap poorly made,"Cheap and poorly made, looks like something that would come from China. Definitely not to be used as a clamp, ergo what's its purpose?"
4,Simple & Handy,"Good to add to your collection of clamps. You could get around this ""luxury"" clamp by using some simplier items, but this is sure quick, convenient, and less cumbersome than using 2+ clamps and blocks/brackets. One of my favorite uses is to use one end to clamp onto a fixture or table, and use the other clamp for workholding . . . viola! instant movable vertical vise! Money well spent."
2,Feels Cheap - Returned Item,In this case you get what you pay for. Feels cheap. Don't bother unless you don't care about having cheap disposable tools.
2,Clamp won't tighten!,"Recently bought a pair of these clamps for gluing up some small picture frames. One side of one clamp won't tighten, the quick release mechanism keeps ratcheting to the next notch. Currently in the process of returning the defective clamp and obtaining a replacement. The other clamp works fine, but 1 defective clamp out of a sample size of 2 doesn't look good for this product."
5,Great for cabinet face frame,"These clamps are great for cabinet assembly. The jaws have a quick release mechanism that provides for fast clamping. In addition, the jaws are somewhat deep that gives some flexibility. These are not for heavy duty assembly of thick wood but perfect for the typical 3/4 inch to 1 1/2 inch work pieces. I just ordered a couple more of them."
4,Works as advertised,Used this to make a wooden frame when it arrived. Worked quite well. Only problem I had was drilling holes in held pieces due to clearance with clamp.
4,A good corner clamp,This corner clamp is stout. No wimpy corner clamp here! The protective pads allow me to clamp faster because I dont have to add a softener like I did with my former clamps. Package was in good shape and delivered in a reasonable time.
5,Quality product at a reasonable price,The Wolfcraft right angle clamp met my expectations of a quality product. It is composed of quality materials and its construction shows that care in assembly was taken to make this a good product. I have used the clamp once and was very pleased with the results.
4,Very Interesting,"The term 'Tarot' most often raises an image--for those of us who have had little or no experience with the ancient technique of interpreting archetypal art on cards--of gypsy fortune tellers dressed in gaudy clothes and primitive jewelry.But I was pleasantly surprised by Toni Gilbert's book, Messages from the Archetypes: Using Tarot for Healing and Spiritual Growth: A Guidebook for Personal and Professional Use. She illustrates how a modern, educated and 'regular' person can benefit from the symbolic art of Tarot.I found it enlightening that Tarot can be used by professional healers and counselors to help people articulate deeply personal issues that may not have been previously evident. Gilbert's book helped me understand the value of Archetypes in the human experience, how they relate to me as an individual, and more important, how to use the information to access my own personal issues."
2,Buy the book that got Troy FIRED from the THE APPRENTICE,"Buy the book that got Troy FIRED from the hit NBC reality-show called ""THE APPRENTICE""! Read the book that turns an otherwise great leader into a ""loose cannon"" that could endanger any organization!When it came down to choosing between Troy who read ""The Art of The Deal"" or the other guy, Donald Trump personally fired Troy almost immediately after Troy mentioned that he had read Donald's book.Why? This book is a waste of money. Donald didn't want anybody dumb enough to buy it running one of his companies. I'm thankful I only borrowed it from a friend but, I still wish I could get my time back.2 stars because I didn't notice any spelling mistakes"
1,Lousy book,"There is nothing to learn from Donald Trump.He inherited his money and is a lousy businessman.As a showman, he has no peers.As a person, he is mediocre."
4,Very entertaining,"I liked this book a lot. Donald Trump is very entertaining, and there are a lot of good ideas in this book, especially if you are interested in real estate."
4,A good look inside the life of Trump,"Other reviews have summed up the book nicely. So, short and to the point, I thought the book was a nice glimpse into the life of a successful businessman. Who doesn't want to be successful? Seeing his everyday life and how he handles people, obstacles, and situations allows the reader to form their own ideas on how to acheive success. I'm not talking just about financial or business success.Some of the stories, I thought, were a little long winded, but I'd rather have long winded good stories rather than short stories making me long for more detail. Trump's got a neat story that many will find interesting."
3,The Art Of The Deal,"The book is more about selling Donald Trump than the art of the deal. If your a donald Trump fan you will love the book. He talks a lot about himself and goes into detail about deals he's made. The book is not for learning about how to make a deal but just that Trump made the deal. Its a good read. Larry Hobson Author ""The Day Of The Rose"
4,the art of the sell,"Trump is like my idol. You have to give it to trump, he knows what the people want, and he gives it to them. How else would one account for this bestseller. Sure, probably 50 percent is fabricated crap. But i dont think most people really care...if this is the real trump or what he wants to be...it sure was a fun read. But it all sounds a little to glamorous to me. Too easy almost, like he has never failed. Trump is very good at highlighing his victories and even better at blatently minimizing the extent of his failures(covering them up). But you have to give him credit; i probably would have done the same. After all, who wants to read about failure? in the end, only the victor is revered......"
3,"Entertaining and a little bit educating, with style","Though many reviewers said that it's not a ""how to"" book, I personally do learn much from Chapter 1 ""Dealing: A week in the Life"" which went through briefly Trump's daily not-so-routine style of working and living, and Chapter 2 ""Trump Cards: The Elements of the Deal"" which mentioned Think Big, Protect the Downside and the Upside will take care of itself, Maximize your options, Know your Market, Use your Leverage, Enhance Your Location, Get the Word Out, Fight Back, Deliver the Goods, Contain the Costs and Have Fun to be Trump's winning cards. The rest are mostly individual chapters/stories/big deals elaborating what had been summarized in the first two chapters.If this book is not so dated and highly focused on real estate deals, I would certainly give it a higher rating. Nevertheless, I enjoy reading it much."
4,Another Mindset Book,"This is another one of D. Trumps book that gives you a walk in his shoes.I love this book because it shows you how someone successful structures thier day out. Once again this book is not going to tell you how to be rich, it does give you a first class ticket into the world of a great business man."
1,Pathetic,Trump will go down as one of our country's greatest embarrassments.New Yorkers used to be amused by him and now he just annoys us.
1,Buy the book and make him even richer,"Calling this book ""boastful"" (Amazon.com official review) is an understatement. This is total self-flattering and self-grandization. This is not a help book that can show you insider secrets to getting rich (if they exist in form at all), nor is it a half-respectable autobiography. Written back in 1989, at the height of his previous career, this book simply tells you that Donald Trump is the modern-day J.C. Some of the accounts of his personal life are nauseating. If you love the Donald like he was your b/f from a previous life, get this book. For all others, avoid as there's no useful information here and its sold purpose was and is to get the Donald even richer."
1,UncleBilly79,Wow...the art of inheriting Daddy's money and how to rip people off and sue them and steal government funds and declare bankruptcy.I think the combover is taking over...Don't waste your money on this it is better used as kindling.
4,The Trump book,This book was a good read. I didn't realize how old it is now but I still enjoyed it. I just have a little trouble with Donald Trump's ego but it was interesting.
5,The Path to the Top,"The book genuinely describes Donald's way to the top. The guy who is the target to so much criticism and jokes these days does deserve at least some respect. I especially like his take on the city officials, their incompetence and outright corruption. The struggle of private enterprise and authorities had never been described better. Extremely valuable advice on the ways to deal with all injustice and unfairness of human interaction in business."
4,Highly entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book. The deals Trump describes take months, if not years to negotiate, so it's nice to have a sequence of key deal events boiled down to a quick, entertaining read. Yes, the book is dated, but so what? If you enjoy real estate, architecture, negotiations, or ""The Apprentice,"" then this is a great book. I'm planning to visit New York soon and it will be fun to visit some of Trumps buildings and know a little of the history behind how they were built. I thank Trump for sharing."
5,quick reading and very entertaining,"a very entertaining account of his life. quite interesting in how he got his empire together. no boring parts at all. a little too much self-promotion, but then trump isnt known for his modesty!"
1,phony,"Donald Trump writes about buying Maralago (his Palm Beach property, that is now a country club), and says in this book that he bought it as a residence. But when he faced a legal situation, the records regarding Maralago were then made public, and they showed he bought Maralogo so as to convert the land into condominiums. ""Spy"" magazine took only the two page section from this book dealing with Maralogo, and found--when comparing it to the court records--lie after lie in literally sentence after sentence ON JUST THOSE TWO PAGES! If there were countless lies on just those two pages, how many lies could there be in the whole book? Garbage in, garbage out."
3,Trump: The Art of the Deal,This was a gift and I haven't heard anything back about it yet. I assume it's fine.
5,Get into the right mindset with this book!,"If you want to be successful, it's valuable to study successful people. With this in mind, ""The Art of the Deal"" gives you an inside look at the ultra-successful, real-estate tycoon, Donald Trump. You'll learn about his thinking process and how you can use it to make better deals in your life. This book offers inspiration and is a must-read for today's entrepreneur.Melanie Rembrandt, Rembrandt Communications"
4,Fascinating!,"Not really a ""How-to"" guide, but yet fascinating. Donald Trump takes you through the story of how and what he did to become the successful man he is. A great read for those who want to go into the real estate business, or even just plain business."
4,Trump,I bought this book for my husband and he really loves it. He even reads it to our kids sometimes! Great condition and arrived quickly.
