4,Andromeda - Season 2,"I enjoyed it and soon I will buy season 3.And in Australia, Andromeda has never been seen in Australia on TV."
4,Andromeda is Worthy,"It's amazing how bad some of the episodes can be. Not as bad as Hercules obviously, but lacking a great comedic actor like Bruce Campbell, Andromeda just can't weather the bad writing. Too bad they can't get the relationships of Farscape, and the beautiful effects.The protagonist is a likable guy, but he suffers from Smallville complex...he never gets in bed with a good looking woman (guess the black hole ate his cajones). Please do not place any emphasis on the purple flower lady, she just kills every scene with her lack of confidence.The message is positive, the science isn't lame, the graphics are pac man leftovers (laughable)and the writers go flat at least three times a season, but the series has Heinlein quality moments and StarTrooper episodes that pull it out. It's not Farscape quality, but it's good."
4,I wish people would stop complaining,"I like Season One a great deal, and I'm now waiting on the Season Two release to be delivered.I just wish people would stop complaining about the fact that ADV released the boxed sets at a lower price than the individual discs. Buying in bulk, things are always going to be cheaper, that's just the way things are. I always wait before buying any series, including this one, because boxed sets will come eventually, and as time goes on, prices will inevitably fall on just about anything.I don't want to be rude, but I think anyone who didn't have the foresight and patience to wait for prices to fall, and boxed sets to come out, and rushed in to buying individually packed discs at inital retail prices, deserved to get ripped off.Bring on the boxed sets for Seasons 3 & 4!!"
2,Now that ADV is gone,"Now that ADV is gone, I'd strongly recommend that the US fans purchase this series from Amazon.ca!Assuming many have been waiting for a price drop as I have, before purchasing.It is being released in Canada via Alliance and the cover price is in the $25.00 Can$ range.ADV over priced and gouged the fans of this show right from the beginning and its unfortunate that it's taken 5 years and the demise of ADV for fans to get a reasonably priced collection of this show on home video."
2,"Slow Toasting, Uneven Browning",This is the worst toaster I have ever owned. It takes FOREVER to toast the bread to a medium color. It also does NOT toast evenly. I am always toasting half-way and then turning the toast over to toast it evenly.I have had the toaster for 3 years and I have am now fed up with it. We seem to be toasting more than ever and i don't have time to mess with a silly toaster.
2,IrisPen locks up after scanning over ten pages,"I agree with the other reviewers that the accuracy of the scanner is very good. However the software locks up after scanning for more than ten minutes. I downloaded and applied the latest patch and tested it on both a Windows 2000 and Windows XP pc, so I don't think it is a client problem. What is worse, I tried repeatedly through email and phone to contact support and got no response. If I had to do all over again I would not buy this product."
1,very poor quality,a very poor quality product. I wish I could get my money back. you would do better to buy a proper scanner and ocr software.
4,It works as promised,"I received the IRIS Pen Express a day ago, installed the software and the pen and started using it right away. I am pleased with the pen scanner. It works as represented and is quite simple to use. I wanted the pen scanner for small scanning jobs out of books etc (I practice law and will use the product in legal research and writing projects). For larger jobs, I will continue use a flat-bed scanner.The IRIS pen is fast and amazingly accurate right out of the box. I carefully considered competing pens and decided to go with IRIS--so I have no experience with QuickLink or other competitors.I think the reviews which are very tough on the IRIS Pen are unwarranted. The IRIS Pen is a very good product. I'm rating this a 4 out of 5 stars but it may be a 4.5 (and nothing is a 5)."
5,A must for collectors of books on Texas history.,"Based on diaries written in the late 1800s, Under The Texas Sun tell the story of a young boy, born during the Civil War, who grows up in East Texas and goes to work on the big ranches in West Texas. True stories written by his granddaughter who inherited his diaries and who recalls sitting by her grandfather's side as he reminisced about his youthful escapades."
1,Wouldn't trust it,Maybe I'm just old school but I wold take cheap rope stringers where they all just hang on the line over this. I thought the green hooks were coated metal. Nope they're plastic. I'm not even sure I'd trust it enough to use for bait fish. As a test I hooked my finger in one of the loops and it pulled out. That one happened to be broke already and the rest held but there is no way I could trust for my fish.
3,"great fit, time will tell","The part appears to be well made and for the most part, it fit perfectly. On the factory part, the ball joint stud has a recessed hex so the nut can be tightened while the stud is held in place with an allen wrench. These thrust arms do not have a way to hold the stud. I was able to get the nut tightened by using a prybar to press against the top of the thrust arm and run the nut on with my impact gun.Time will well if the legendary Moog quality is comparable or better than the OE parts."
3,More blues -- much more -- than plot or characters,"Ace Atkins' novels are labors of love for the blues, about which he evidences deep knowledge and overwhelming affection. He's a reporter first and a novelist a long way second: read to learn about one of America's most revered musical genres, but lower your expectations in terms of plot or character."
1,Worthless,I thought this magazine would give us a lot of insight to the world of RVing. It does not. It is filled with advertisment and new campers. I didn't know I was automatically set up with auto renewal. They will not let me cancel- even though I tried in Nov 2012 to cancel renewal in March 2013!. Do not buy this magazine.
2,Trailer Life,"I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one?Dave TumanNew Bern , NC"
2,Two duplicates (so Far),"I expected the auto-renewal to kick in following the expiration of my current subscription, but no, for the past two months i've received 2 duplicate magazines, both on the same day and of course same issue.Fortunately, it's not a king's ransom and I'll probably get screwed for worse during my life time. Chalk it up to experience. Lesson learned. Wait until one expires and then order again if you like it, probably at a cheaper rateNice magazine. I just don't need to read it in stereo. I feel much better now. Thanks for asking my opinion."
1,Never Got It,"I don't know why I was asked to review this. I've yet to see a copy. Maybe someday it will come, until then it's less than one star."
3,Somewhat informative,"I'm not sure if it's the format or what but it seems that the articles are buried in advertising. I can easily page right by an article when I'm looking for it. I really don't think there's any more advertising in this mag than any others; it just seems like it. I believe if the articles were presented more prominently, it would be better. The articles are good."
2,Released Before Enough Funny Parts Were Added,"The original ""Get Fuzzy"" had me laughing at more than half of the cartoons. ""Fuzzy Logic"" got about 3 serious laughs and 3-4 chuckles. It wouldn't have been worth the used book price. Book 3 comes out in a few months. I'll probably buy it, but I'm concerned that I'll be wasting my money."
1,GET FUNNY!,"I cannot understand the fascination with this strip. The art is sensational. The writing is belaboured. I envision this guy at deadline head in hands, thinking, ""what should I write about? I know. I'll make the cat sassy and the dog oblivious. That'll appease the audience for the next 10 years.""There is a lot of potential here. And he does hit once or twice a month, but no job will let you get away with delivering 3 percent of the time, so why do we all think this ""cat' is the next best thing. Give me Adams, Schultz, Trudeau, Watterson, Larson or Amend over this [guy] anyday."
1,Slow Witted.,"What is the praise this strip recieves? That Kat is so not funny. There is something that I have never seen before, an annoying cat. Where did Conley come up with such a brilliant idea? I can't believe that an annoying cat has never been thought of before for other comics. Please somebody put this strip out of its misery, or else just realize that this is a less than average strip."
4,Try to ease through the ambiguity,"Is this supposed to be funny? or what's the word, oh yeah, wry. This comic represents everyting that is wrong with society. How can truely funny cartoons compete against such an unrealistic and supernatural version of what is ""normal"". These characters represent such an unattainable segment of comedy, that it little leaves room for mediocrity. Maybe cartoon publishers should team up with software companies and pervade every aspect of american life. While they are at it, maybe they could teach us all how to be good citizens and purchase saturns. Everyone knows that they are the most reliable cars on the road and someday i hope to save enough dough to buy one."
5,Get Fuzzy rocks,"Get Fuzzy is the best strip alive today and may well be one of the top five strips of all time. It is original, quirky, and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The beauty of it is, the content appeals to both pet owners and non-pet owners alike. After devouring Get Fuzzy in the paper for months (often completely ignoring all other strips), I happened to pick up The Dog is Not a Toy, Mr. Conley's first collection. It was tremendously entertaining and the sort of work I continue to pick up and peruse months later. Since then, I have been anxiously been awaiting his second effort. It surpasses the first in charm, humor, and the artists understated and often wry social and political satire. Mr. Conley possesses a truly fresh voice, talented and hand, and keen insight and I hope he continues to produce such engaging works well into the future."
4,Get ready to get tickled,"I admit it - I'm hooked on Darby Conley's comedy, Bucky, Satchel and Rob. I buy the books for myself. I have the Get Fuzzy calendars. I buy the books for friends and relatives and I'm absolutely sure everyone who reads and sees Get Fuzzy will become a die hard fan."
5,The truth about cats and dogs...,"Darby Conley does it again in his follow up to the first ""Get Fuzzy"" collection 'The Dog Is Not A Toy'.For those unfamiliar with the daily strip, it brings the pet perspective to life. Envision your cat sneaking the charge cards or your dog choosing the main dish for the evening meal. 'Get Fuzzy' allows Bucky (the one fanged cat) and Satchel (the loveable loaf of a pup) to express themselves in a human manner that anyone who has ever wondered what their cat or dog were thinking will love.The pets and their owner, Rob, function as a family and there is a wonderful human quality to the scenes that could only be brought about by a real pet lover.For pet lovers everywhere or anyone who enjoys Dilbert, Peanuts, or Frumpy the Clown - the 'Get Fuzzy' collections will be sure to bring a smile to your day. Enjoy!"
4,Funny!,"these books just crack me up, my only complaint is they are too short! I never want to put them down, and read the whole thing in one sitting."
4,Romberg is still great,"Good music never goes bad. Romberg was of another generation, yet modern musicians and entertainers do perform his music with quality and heart. Buy this album while it is still available."
5,"Wonderful production, great singers",This is a real gem of a recording. The singers are outstanding. Their performances really make this grand old operetta shine.
4,Fascinating reading,"If you have ever found yourself wondering whether whales drink seawater or you are not sure whether to believe the international press when it tells you that dolphins protect swimmers from sharks, then this is the book for you. It is a fascinating compendium of whale and dolphin facts, a collection of answers to frequently asked questions put forward by the generally interested public to Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The scope is wide, ranging from whale evolution, through biology and research, to hunting and fisheries interaction. Pretty much anything you ever wanted to know about cetaceans is covered in this book. With pin-sharp colour photographs by Flip Nicklin, this is a great read cover to cover and a handy reference book for regular dipping in to. Something of a must-have for all cetacean enthusiasts."
1,Item Quality,It is not the fault of the the store but this item is overvalued. It is a spiral bound paper back not what I expected and not something I would normally pay $100.00 for. The supplier was prompt in delivery and teh packaging good.
4,Great replacement!,"I've had a set of UR-15C 'phones for years now; they've seen me through multiple cross country trips and been in daily use at my computer for at least six months. I was heartbroken to find they'd been discontinued! I bought a pair of KHP-21v.. it only took me a few hours' use to decide they were not what I sought. I returned them, did a bit more research, and ordered these. the box has been open for less than an hour, and I can already tell you they're a perfect match of the UR15s. so glad to have my headphones back! great sound quality, comfortable, with a bit of noise reduction that makes them great for use around the house."
3,Very low volume output,"Fit is awesome, sound is good but the max volume output on these cans is SO horribly low. With the volume MAXED out on my devices used for music/games listening it BARELY passes for me to even keep these things layin around."
1,Breaks after two months of use.,"Most of the reviews on these head phones looked pretty promising, so I decided to go ahead and purchase it. However after two months of use the left speaker on the headphones stopped working. In addition to that, the cover that holds the foam in place (soft part that goes over both ears) is ripping and exposing the foam on both sides. I definitely do NOT recommend this product. Buyer beware. To break down in such a way is absolutely unacceptable. This is unfortunate, as I am outside Amazon's one month return policy and because of the price I got it for, shipping it in for a warranty claim would not be worth it. This was probably what Koss, the manufacturer, counted on anyway.If you are looking for headphones that would last for more than two months, I would recommend looking somewhere else."
3,Don't buy for a kid,Good headphones for home use for someone that is careful with their stuff. I bought these for my kids to take to school to use with their computer cirriculum. My son broke his in weeks. My daughter's are still in one piece but she never usues them. If you are buying these to use at home with your PC or stereo they are a good choice. They have good sound and are comfortable. Good buy for the money.
2,The jack was slightly too small.,"The sound quality was alright, but the sound came through very quietly (perhaps due to the length of the cord?) My main issue with the headphones was that it seemed the jack was slightly too small, such that you hand to press it in the socket to get a clear sound. I've stopped using these headphones due to that issue."
2,Why is this a classic?,"The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide..... by W. Tmothy GallweyThis book was recommended to me by Fuzzy Yellow Balls. It took 250 pages to say: "" Be positive and relax and that will improve your tennis experience.""J. Fournell"
3,This is a 1974 book,"The only thing that benefit my game is confirmed that my understanding of ""feeling the ball/shot."" Other than that, there is not a whole lot in the book. I also agree in learning tennis, sometimes, it's learned through image than instruction. With the content and the year it's published, this should be priced at $5.00."
3,"The content is great, but the layout is not!!!","I really liked the book, but im very disappointed with the Kindle version, which is pretty expensive, compared to what you get.The layout of the book is broken, so its difficult to read tables, figures and other non-normal text.Fix this if you want to charge that much for a kindle version.."
5,Very good for the serious player,"This book has been out for many years, I found it to be very informative. If you have ever played in the zone, you know how great that is, and the book gives tips on how to reach that mental state on a consistent basis. I re-read various parts regularly."
1,sucky book mumbo jumbo,"this book sucks. it only talks about one thing, to not think when your playing tennis. then it goes around over and over just rephrasing itself. i think the author may have took drugs to be this tripped out."
1,"Too many ""selfs"" to follow",This book started off making sense but then it kept talking about Self A and Self B.... It went around topics. It kind of made it hard to keep up with reading. It never really helped my game at all and so I looked for other books. There are other books out there that can help your mental tennis game.
1,a very dull read,This book is very out-dated and not too insightful. Each time I picked it up I started to fall asleep. What I really wanted was help on my mental game. What you get here is pompous psychobabble.
5,The Inner game of Tennis,Excellent approach to a topic that interests every amateur and pro. Let's see what happens when I put the ideas into practice. Fun to read as well.
3,Good thing its short,"I read this book after reading an article about Pete Carroll. The ideas behind the book seemed right on and I can completely understand why it is seen as such an insightful book. That being said the premise is play with out thinking, react, and play on your sense. In the first two chapters this strategies is laid out in front of you then the rest of the book is dedicated to try to make sure you don't think. That's a lot of reading about not over thinking. I found it to be funny that you were reading so much about trying not to think it actually made it harder not to think. But it is well written and has some valuable tools for coaches to use when teaching young athletes."
3,Classic not as practical as recent resources,"Gallwey's book was an instant classic when it first came out. It was somewhat revolutionary at the time as few sport psychology books were available for the tennis public. It still makes good bathroom reading and it still applies to a general lifestyle, not just about tennis. However, there are currently more practical mental toughness or mental zone books out there which are easier to read and use. Still Gallwey's book is interesting philosophy more than psychology as he works with your automatic and analytic selves (self 1 and 2) which conflict each other.Gallwey addresses why negativity and self-analysis inhibits the creative, automatic self. Readers become more aware of how being in the ""zone"" really works. Recently, there have been advances in sport psychology which pushes some of Gallwey's ideas a bit out there although he is still on the right path. I would recommend ""Zennis"" (Peter Spang) over the ""Inner Game"" since it is more practical."
4,Re-wrote my mental picture of me playing tennis,"Not a book of technique but one which transformed my attitude to playing tennis. Gallwey explains his transformation from a an ego-driven win-at all-cost player, to a yoga-player who played for the experience without desire to win, to a player who concentrates on making the effort to win. The latter concept, as opposed to being concerned about winning, was the most profound part of the book for me. It explained paradoxes I had felt in competing as purely social player, where often I had not wanted to win. The book has taught me to think less, to concentrate more, and to focus on playing in the present without harse self-judgement. Gallwey insists that he has not written a self-help book, but his philosophy is certainly applicable to wider spheres, not the least learning new sports such as, in my case, roller-blading. I'm trying to just 'let it happen"". A book that needs to be kept and read over."
5,Mentally Better,Improve your serve and strokes with this mental guide for tennis. You'll be able to knock down those barriers in your mind that keep you from playing a superior game.
2,This Book is Pretty Out There,"While I strongly believe that the mental side of tennis plays a huge role in one's performance, I found this book to be too theoretical without much practical application. Mr Gallwey starts the book by explaining Self-1 verses Self-2 and how Self-1 must allow Self-2 to play the game. While I found this form of existentialism interesting, I found very little that I could use in my tennis matches. I prefer a book with more practical applications for maintaining a strong postive attitude with direct discussion of how to flow with the game so I can hit the ball both accurately and smoothly without over thinking. If you're looking for a book like this, I would recommend 'The Mental Edge' by Ken Baum instead."
4,Good for all athletes,"While this book has tennis undertones, the implications range well beyond the tennis court. The lessons are useful for all athletes that are ""in their own way"" of performing at their best. The mental training suggested is simple, yet effective. As a coach, the simpler the better for my players. I've used the ideas with my players already."
3,Two good tracks...,"We all know the rule... three good songs to buy the album. I got this one on faith, but I was betrayed. Living on the Ceiling and Don't Tell Me were, as I should have guessed, the only tracks worthwhile on this album. The rest was dull and boring. My advice - pass this one by."
5,a forgotten 80's classic ...,"Blancmange is truly a forgotten classic from the 80's that epitomized the New Wave era. 'Lose Your Love' from the film Flight of the Navigator was one of the first songs I remember, and this is the only CD with that track. Some of the other hits are on here as well such as 'Living on the Ceiling' and several others."
1,This is not lindisfarne,"This is not Lindisfarne. More likely, a bunch of retired geezers come out for a sing per kindness the benevolence of an indulgent recording company. Where is the trademark accoustic jingle jangle of lindisfarne? Where are those singalong tunes? Where are the great lyrics and the bustling energy of alan hull and co? Dingley dell, Back and Fourth, Fog on the Tyne...those were Lindisfarne. Not this apology............SUNU CHARLES"
3,Ten Tenors Best with Opera and Classical,"The Ten Tenors are incredible singers of opera and classical music. Their voices blend perfectly and they can really reach those high notes. However, it's sad to see their talent wasted on the likes of Queen, Elvis and other pop and rock tunes. Anyone can sing those, but the Ten Tenors are some of the few who can really sing the classics beautifully."
3,Not Quite As Expected,"This DVD was less than expected for me since I had seen The Ten Tenors perform locally this past year. Since they recorded this in 2004, they have added many more numbers to their performance including a great imitation of the BeeGees and other humorous musical tributes. I am looking forward to an American version of their Heros performance and hope it has more of the new stuff!!!"
1,Boring! Bummer!,"Bought this for my wife, a true opera lover. We ended up fast-forwarding through most of the last half. Very boring! Mediocre talent. Don't waste your time or money. This once viewed DVD is now destined to sit on the shelf forever."
2,The Ten Tenors - Larger Than Life,"Saw these gentlemen on the Tony Danza Show (TV) for the first time. They sang a medly of 50s songs and I enjoyed them very much. They advertised this CD as the one with the 50s songs so I ordered it. Disappointedly I received a cd with all classical music and was very disappointed, and you can't return CDs, so I rated it as a 2 since I do not enjoy classical music."
1,Disaster....,Fell victim to previous ratings...so cheap including the musical accompany...find it..so unnatural with these...singers singing MOST of the songs or arias... JUST the same it was a good thing to come out of Australia !! WOW.i just finnish watching the MO tenors..WHAT a great differance..!!
5,10 Tenors- Larger Than Life,"We saw their show in Reno, Nevada at the beginning of April. The show was very entertaining and different from the DVD. Their comaraderie comes out in their singing and their performance. I would advice for you to watch their concert live.The Dvd is great. I would encourage to also get the CD. It is great to see them perform the songs they sing."
3,"The Ten Tenors - Larger than life ,is only a shadow of what they can do.","The performance is good, but it lacks the atmosphere, presentation and punch of a concert which was performed by the Ten Tenors and superbly filmed and recorded by a German T.V. crew in Hamburg, titled , ""Here's To The Heros "". It is ""absolutely "" outstanding ! Unfortunately only the CD version appears to be available for unlucky North Americans . I was wanting to buy a copy of Here's To The Heros for my sister in Canada and friends in Austin Texas but alas , the DVD is only available to regions 2,3,4,5 and 6 in the PAL format. Why , Warner Bros.Music , Why ? ?"
5,kinder chocolate,what's the question?Kinder is so yummmmmmy!!Thank you for making this chocolate available to us without having to travel abroad!
4,Tastes great.,I thought it tasted great. On the the hand most of the Germans I've met however consider it cheap kids candy.
4,yum,"Its good, but not great. It is milk chocolate with white chocolate inside. I would recommend this to people who like Hershey's!"
4,Utilitarian,"This is a terrific item at a great price, much more reasonable than the expensive Cingular store contraptions, and perfect for kids (and grownups) who are always losing things. Lose this, and you can get another one, and still have paid less for both than for just one from the mobile store."
4,Quite an informative report on the subject,"I believe this book dealt with a subject everyone would like to know about , but no one is willing to talk about.It's not the book for the after-dinner fireplace setting, but one which will be an excellent reference at one time or another during one's life time."
4,"Older book, but very informative.",This book was older but I knew that and it DID offer the information I was wanting!
1,"Dated, dull, and unhelpful","I write this as someone who recently faced the terminal illness and death of a loved one. I found this book to be very dull, for the most part a collection of VERY meandering and unfocussed interviews of the dying (transcribed verbatim). In particular, the topic turned frequently to religion, and as we both were/are atheists this discussion was completely irrelevant and irritating to me.I found another book called ""I don't know what to say"" to be vastly superior for me as a practical compedium of suggestions on how I could handle (and help my loved one handle) the situation."
4,helpful,I have recently lost my father. This book gave me insight and some structure into my thoughts and feelings. I recommend the book
4,An extremely valuable resource,"Kubler-Ross does an outstanding job of synthesizing her years of observation and experience into a succinct, readable volume. She tackles the difficult issues of death and loss with candor and sensitivity. This book provides brilliant insights into the nature and purpose of mourning, how to face one's mortality, how to let the certainty of death enhance one's life, how to deal with the death of a loved one and minister to people in grief. Her ""five stages"" are quintessential and have helped countless people deal with death. This book is a sobering and enlightening journey. Highly recommended."
4,Very interesting informative book,This book was an interesting and infromative book on the process of how people deal with death and grief whether they are the person dying or perhaps a family member. Very insightful.
5,Essential Reading,"A brilliant book by E. Rubler-Ross who has dedicated her life to researching the needs of terminally ill patients & their families. This is essential reading for everyone, whether you have had to face death (either your own or a loved one) or not. It is common for Westerners to deny death by not discussing it, or even thinking about it. This book illustrates the many problems that can arise from this attitude & the heartache it can cause the terminally ill & their families. Thanks to E. Kubler-Ross for an amazing lifetime achievement."
3,"Helps you understand they dying...,not yourself",I was looking for how to deal with my own feelings after being 24 and watching my mother die of lung cancer. This book helps you understand how the dying deal with death. It is interesting....I found out what kind of dying person my mother was (but she had already passed). I dealt with her dying how I knew how to and not how she wanted to deal with it. So I would suggest you read this before they die so you know how to console them. It doesn't really help you for after they pass because then they aren't there for you to help them.
1,The book made me want to die,I could barely stay awake while trying to read this book. It really sucks. It was very boring. I only read it because I had to for my class.
4,Feeling good About Death,"This book may serve as training wheels for those who have done little thinking or reading about death or dying but beyond that it is of limited value.Ms Ross has been a tireless proponent that a humanistic answer to death is unquestionably necessary and effective. She panders to our need to believe that death is easier and less painful then it actually often is. So this is a well written and convincing book to those who want to feel good and want to feel in control of death. But death can be a profoundly transformative force in peoples lives when we do not seek simple answers and answers that act as prozac. Dealing with death in a genuine and full way is difficult, time consuming. But since people prefer quick easy, feel good answers this book fits the bill just fine. What surprises me is why this book doesnt come with a packet of ""Hot Cocoa For the Mortal Soul"""
3,ON DEATH AND DYING,It was a very interesting book on death and dying but I don't think that I got as much out of the book as I had expected.
2,a bubble of Bunin,"These novellas and stories were nothing but soap bubbles. I admired their shimmering colors and graceful movement while i was reading them. But the final period was like a pin. Pop! Ideas, plot, characters, setting--all gone as if they never existed.Great writing lives off the page. Stories by the masters (Wharton, Twain, Borges, James, Maupassant to name but a few) stay with you as vivid experiences. Bunin, we are told, was one of these. A Nobel laureate. The inheritor of the mantle of Tolstoy and Turgenev. The artist who carried Russian Literature into the 20th Century. There is little evidence of that in this volume."
2,Not impressed.,"Okay, I realize I didn't pay a mint for these things, but they're Koss, so I thought they would be ""better"". The sound is pretty decent if your willing to hold them against your ears. The clips seem to hold the speakers too far from your ears, so it ends up sounding ""tinny"". The clips tend squeeze your ears after a period of time, and it begins to hurt. Short periods tend to be okay, but after a time, it's painful. Overall, I'm not impressed and wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
2,Rip Off,"I just bought this and a portable speaker system to use with my MP3 player. When i opened the box, they looked like pretty good headphones but when i tried to put them on, i realized that it wouldnt actually ""clip"" on. It had the clip, but, unlike other models that i have had before this one, it wouldnt click open and shut. I paid $10 for these. This is half the price of the Portable speaker system i got which was only 20. Hmmmmm....... Anyway, it did hav pretty good sound when i held the thing up to my ear, which is why i gave it a ""2"" star instead of a ""1"". Overall: DONT BUY IT!!!"
5,Koss KSC7,"Being hearing impaired, I need headphones on my computer. These give me a clear sound and are light on the ears. I've used these for a couple of months now and they are still like new."
3,headphones,"i liked the product at first because the headphones stayed on my ears quite well, but then after a week the earpieces that held the headphones on my ears got weaker and they wouldnt stay on while i was working out"
2,poor fit,"I found this headphone set to be inadequate for MY needs, the cord was a bit short and I really needed a 90 degree connector. The most unappealing thing about this headphone set to ME is the clip that holds it on your ear, it is a fixed plastic tab that was uncomfortable. The speakers had adequate low frequency response when held snugly against the ear but the plastic tab loosely held the speaker in place rendering the base response less than adequate.With this said I was still going to give them a 3 star rating because my son thought they were OK but this is not my sons review, it is my review so MY judgment must stand, I unfortunately did not like them."
4,"Inexpensive, comfortable and functional","I originally bought these headphones locally. It is very hard to find good 'hang on the ear' headphones. They were no where to be found 3 years later and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. They are lightweight, conmfortable and easy to use. I can even fall asleep with them on because they are so soft. The sound is good enough for me."
2,Bad Design Clip-on Style Headphone,the clipper is fixed and very tight and it can not be rotated at all. It is a bad Clip-on design headphone.
2,EAR PHONES,Sound is excellent but the ear clip-ons are bulky and pop off - ultimately not popping back on.Prefer Panasonic for use over ears. I do not like ear buds because they don't fit my ear opening well - Over the ear phones work just fine!
5,Essence of cool,"I grew up watching this with my dad, and watching it again after 2 decades is just great. Banacek is so cool. Absolutely great fun, sure wish they had made more episodes. I think Columbo will be on my shopping list soon, these old mysteries were so well made. It's also neat to sort of step back in time seeing the cities, cars, and fashions."
4,"Good entertainment, but... issues with playback Season 2 Disk 2","Love watching the show, but stumbled when watching Season 2, Episode 3 ""Rocket to Oblivion"" - the DVD programming for playback had a hitch and would not play the show past the 4th scene. Our temporary fix: Load the DVD into a computer and open as FILES (not as a dvd), then drag the .VOB files for the episode (one at a time) to DVD player to finish watching the episode (InterVideo Win DVD on a PC, MPEG Streamclip on a Mac)."
3,Faulty DVDs,"Great series that I remembered from my early teen years. Grew up with series like this.I bought this set about two years ago but was only able to watch a few episodes, the discs were not readable. Not just one DVD player, but two different ones, a PC and a laptop also couldn't read them. Four different machines and none of them could play these DVDs.Amazon was great. I returned the set, got a new one, same problem, returned/replaced again, same problem. They finally gave up and just gave me a refund.Maybe just a manufacturing glitch at the time and things have improved."
5,Banacek Series,Great set it appears to be two differnt collection's of episods but other than that works greathave not finished the whole set yet but so far is just as adverized.
2,Somethings are best forgotten,The quality of the DVD is fine.Im the only one that can watch this because its so corny and I have to bypass some of the womanizing scenes.
2,Maybe it was better in Spanish. . .,"If you can plod through the first half, the second half gets much better. After we meet Theresa Mendoza preparing to run for her life after the killing of her drug-runner boyfriend, the story continues as we follow her flight from Mexico to Southern Spain, new drug-runner boyfriend, prison time, etc. Finally, the second half improves as we see Theresa weave a complex web of corporate structures designed to cover her own drug transport business that would make any corporate tycoon proud. While there are some exciting moments, the story is mostly predictable and ends up an unsatisfying read. Put this at the bottom of the pile on your bedside table."
4,ADDICTIVE!,"This is one of those books that make me glad my native tongue is Spanish. A warning, tough: This book makes extensive use of Mexican Slang (Being Mexican I had trouble understanding one word!) So, even if your Spanish (as second language) is good, I would recommend reading the translated work; other than that, I understand the English translation is very good. So, forget about all the reviews and start reading ""Queen"". It is as addictive as the drugs its characters deal with.Four and a half stars."
1,"Unreadable, disjointed, uninspired","After reading just over a quarter of this book, I've decided to stop reading it. I'm a voracious reader, and have only abandoned a book once before. The best I can say about ""The Queen of the South"" is that it contains some pleasing descriptive phrases. The narrator is unidentified, as is his interest in/connection to the main character, as is his ability to know the main characters thoughts, despite having met her only once. The book would be a hundred pages shorter if Teresa Mendoza had spent less time mentally cursing her dead lover. Yeesh. I hear it gets pretty interesting if you can keep wading through the muck. I can't. I couldn't care less what happens to these characters."
1,"I kept waiting,,,,,,,","I kept waiting for the book to get better, the story just kept going, seem as though she was trying to replace her first boyfriend? trying to take control? you'd think at some point she would have learn and the unnecessary droning details((aarghh!! ) I read all the other reviews, are we reading/listening to the same book? and the spanish!!!!! arrghhhhh! The best part about the book is when she left Mexico( can you imagine the readers expectation, ""its really going to get good now"", and it went down hill from there."
1,"Please go back to the ""arcane""","If no one had told me what I was reading, I would never have guessed that the author of this *sensationally* violent trash could be the same person who wrote Seville Communion, Flanders Panel, Fencing Master, etc. I only hope that it is a ""stage"" and that he returns to what Booklist called his ""arcane"" writing --- write what you know, not what you research."
3,Good book but with a slow start,"This book started very slow, towards the middle of the book is when the good action and the real queen of the south story starts. It is very well narraated, although the book still has some spelling errors here and there. Overall the book was very entertaininga good read."
2,unsatisfied,"I purchased this book intending to recieve it within 21 business days, however the book never came. They have notified me that they must have recieved errors at their warehouse. They gave me a full refund. But I am not satisfied because I wanted that book and now they don't even have it for around the same price. I am so frustrated when all I wanted was the product. I still purchase from Amazon but just not happy right now with my latest purchase."
2,Frustrating to read!,"I did not like this book and had an extremely difficult time finishing it. It is not well written and it is hard to follow. The subject matter is disgusting, throughout the entire book. I gave it to my sister and she couldn't finish it. I would not waste my money on this book. If you are a fan of the author, buy it used and try to wade through it. Be prepared to be frustrated and annoyed!"
3,Very powerful woman but heavy theme,"I had a hard time getting into reading this book. The drug cartel theme is scary and heavy. I almost did not finish the book but gave it a chance. The character, Teresa Mendoza, is a very strong, powerful woman and probably deserves the title ""Queen of the South"" (though it is difficult to equate a queen to drug cartels). The fight scene, towards the end, is interesting.The question is still-is she real or a myth?"
2,"""The Queen"" not my cup of tea","Perez-Reverte is a master novelist, but this is not among my favorites. I found the shifting points of view too jerky and hindered my comprehension of the complex story of the poor girl rising to become ""The Queen of the South."" The tale takes us to all the exotic locales one comes to love in a Perez-Reverte novel, and introduces us to his usual cast of equally colorful and unique characters. Like a good thriller on the screen, Perez-Reverte's gets tremendous mileage out of his secondary and supporting characters. Some will love this tale of the men and women in the world of narco-trafficantes, but ""The Queen"" was just not my cup of tea."
4,4.5 Stars -- This is a terrific read,"I'm surprised more people haven't reviewed this book by now. This is a ""straight forward"" story. But what a story! I can't that I really liked the ""Queen"" but she is a fascinating character with an amazing story. The end of the story was a little disappointing but the rest of the story (and other characters) is well worth your time. I'll read this again."
5,Riveting,"There was abundant action, and characters who developed and changed as the story progressed; indeed, this was one of the themes of the book. I found this book to be excellent from cover to cover, though I had hesitated to begin it due to some poor reviews. I was particularly put off by one review which contended that this was simply a retelling of the Count of Monte Cristo. It is not, so don't let that stop you."
2,Not a queen,"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's books that I have struggled to finish. The ham-handed interviewer slows the story down to a crawl every time he enters. And the story itself has none of the fascinating complications and turns that make the author's other novels (Club Dumas, Flanders Panel) so fascinating. No queen, just a lady in waiting. Disappointing."
3,Meet My Little Friend,"This was a very entertaining book (B+).This story chronicles the rise of Teresa Mendoza from the girl friend (in Mexico) of a low level drug transporter to a woman who is the head of one of the largest transporters of narcotics in Europe. Along the way Teresa has love affaires , disposes of traitors and enemies,and reinvents herself. She was not someone I admired but she was never dull. I enjoyed reading about southern Spain,Gibralta, and Spanish Morocco. I would like to read other books by the author."
2,"I'm disappointed, Arturo","I've been your adoring fan all through your other classy, elegant books, which are among my favorite fiction---especially ""The Seville Communion."" But ""Queen of the South"" is too much a departure, for me, from your usual stylish novels. I'm surprised at the rave reviews of many readers. I and my more discriminating reading friends don't understand why you wasted your talents on writing a book that borders on pulp trash about a sleazy woman in the sleazy drug world. There are already too many authors churning out pulp, disposable fiction. Did you just want to do something different? Okay, you've done that now, so please return to the Perez-Reverte that I knew and loved...and I'll return to adoring you."
2,Characters I don't care about,"The author was recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I respect. Perhaps Perez-Reverte's other books are better, but this one was very dull and the characters were lifeless. I can see that the author has a good writing style, but here his technique was wasted on characters and circumstances that I simply couldn't care about. I rarely give up on a book, but after plodding through the first 100 pages I decided I'd read enough. The was no snap, no sparkle, no mystery, no suspense, no fun. Even the death of a character was essentially ""ho-hum, the (Spanish expletive) was dead."" Yawn."
2,Another disappointed fan...,"I'm a huge fan of Perez-Reverte generally, but - like a couple of previous reviewers - am very disappointed with this one so far. I was warned that it's very slow to get going and I'm only on Pg 100 but I think I'm going to have to put this down for a while and try again later. Somehow it manages to be both sleazy and deadly dull. And why do all the characters and many of the bars and restaurants need so many different names and nicknames? It may be authentic, but it doesn't move the narrative forward and sure makes for tedious reading. The characters, including the heroine Theresa, seem flat, unreal and unattractive. Perez-Reverte has failed to breathe life into any of them. He does paint a vivid picture of the world of drug trafficking but that isn't enough to sustain this peculiarly lifeless story. If I change my mind when I come back and finish the book, I'll amend my review!"
3,Hard to believe this is Perez-reverte,"I've read all his previously translated novels, and felt they all had something in commmon...a sense, or aura, of mystery. Who are these people, what is really going on? At the heart of each of his previous novels were questions you could not wait to have answered.This novel read as a straightforward story. There was no mystery, you always knew exactly what was going on. To me, this was a disapointment. The story itself was fine, and as all his books are, very well written. There was just nothing special about it.I gave it three stars because it was beautifully written, but for Perez-Reverte, 3 stars is a major disappointment. If you read this, do not expect a typical story by him, expect something much more mainstream, something any of hundreds of authors could write."
3,"The not so pink, orange tip up","We ordered this tip up for a gal who had never ice fished let alone seen ice on a lake. She was so excited when we told her we ordered her two ""Pink"" her favorite color, tip ups. When they came they were orange. Everything about the ad suggested they were Pink. Of course we took them apart and painted them Pink for her. She was so excited at the end result, which should have been what we received in the first place as this is what the ad was selling. Pink Tip Ups"
1,dissapointing,"This is, at best, a poorly done book. As a professional photographer, I thought it would be helpful for me to know a little more about makeup. This book has the basics, but the example photos don't look particularly impressive and the writing seems carelessly or hastily written.There don't seem to be a lot of books on makeup for photographers, but I didn't think this book was worth the price."
1,Thank god I checked it out at library,"I recently checked this book out at the library. Thank God I did before I bought it. It should instead be titled, ""Makeup application for little girls that think lipstick all over the face is a good look."" It would have been more accurate.If I was the author of this book, I would be ashamed of some of the images. He obviously didn't look closely at the photos that were supposed to be representative of what he was writing about. The eyeliner is jagged and not close to the eye. The foundation is oily and dirty looking. The child's clown makeup looks like she probably put it on herself.This book is a waste."
5,The Brit Fab-5,"Love, Honour and Obey is a hilarious story of the North-versus-South London gangwars. Full of karaoke, Elvis Suits, and sexual mishaps to keep you laughing. With a great cast (including Jude Law!) attempting to be tough, and Jonny Lee Miller in a clown suit you will be rather amused throughout the film."
5,"Loved it, Never tired of it!","Bottom line, if you're just a Jude Law fan as many have mentioned, you will not enjoy this movie. This movie is for lovers of British cinema, whether it be blockbuster or independent. I'm a big fan of Britain and I was lucky enough to understand not only the jokes, but the history behind them that lend itself to the hilarity of it all. Rhys Ifans as the thugged out Welshman (not true for all Welsh) in the scene with the firebomb screaming his insults, only the British and their legions can truly know how funny that is. The entire North vs. South London theme was pretty funny, too. It goes to show that the British have a great sense humor regarding their bulldog spirit. A+ film. Not one for this side of the pond."
1,I never walk out of a movie but...,"The only reason why I rented this movie was because Jude Law is in it. It just goes to show that all actors star in horrible movies from time to time. Watching ""Love,Honour and Obey"" is like watching a movies deleted scenes without watching the actual movie. Deleted scenes are often of low quality, there's no point to them and they're very boring. That sums this movie up in a nut shell."
2,not too happy,"Well I hate to admit it but I rented this movie because I am so impressed with Jude Law and I wanted to see some of his other work. I just didn't enjoy this movie at all. He was absolutely the best thing about it. It just seemed silly to me and I never did laug,but, I was totally bored. I didn't quite make it half way. Maybe if I had it would have gotten better but I just didn't like it at all. Sorry!"
3,YOU LIKE MY PANTHER?,"This is a cheesy movie about 2 drug dealers named Lazy (Deadlee) and Shorty (Ernie Islas). They are involved in deals with a gay guy named Mike(Peter Tahoe). Guera (Monique La Barr) is Lazy's girlfriend, although lazy has a few girlfriends. Guera attempts to win Lazy by visiting a seer, which I found to be the campiest scene in the film. The acting and dialouge are simply bad and trite in an attempt to be funny. The film had potential but doesn't deliver the cheese it needed to be successful.F-bomb, sex, side breast nudity, cat fight."
3,"Works as expected, but isn't an Apple product",The battery works but you can tell it isn't a apple product... The battery doesn't fit perfectly on my MacBook Pro. It actually 'stands out' a little bit. The button on the battery meter doesn't 'click' smoothly it is more lie a thump. I would suggest buying original.
1,Doesn't work at all,"Unfortunately, this battery doesn't work at all with my MBP. The battery arrived fully discharged and won't take a charge at all. I left it charging overnight; nothing. I've rebooted, power cycled the computer, nothing. Time to return it."
5,"Very nice, quality product.","This vest was very well made, ran alittle big but otherwise, the description was on the money. Would recommmend."
4,Rothco Deluxe Safari Outback Vest,"Size and fit perfect, plenty of cargo space.Color advertised as Khaki is not what I would call Khaki. Khaki is tan or light brown. The color of vest received a light olive drab.Outside of color it will get used."
2,"Not nearly as good as the ""Big Pockets"" Vest I bought.","For birdwatching, I prefer a vest with as many large, USABLE pockets as possible. Unfortunately, this vest has too many small pockets that are more decorative than usable. After I bought this one, I bought the Big Pockets brand and it is far superior for my needs."
4,"Good vest for the price, but the color?","This is my fourth vest, I started with Domke Photo vest, wore it out three years ago, then the Humvee then Foxfire(almost a replica of the Humvee), I was looking for something to replace the Humvee, after I received it I have to agree with the previous two buyers, I ordered Khaki, but this color is definitely Olive drab (I actually saw the khaki after I ordered), and it is alomost identical to the foxfire, from a distance, you may not be able to tell the difference, but the price is lower, the quality is similar, very pratical."
4,The Khaki Vest Is Olive Drab!!!,"Yes, the earlier post about vendor color blindness is spot on. I received my vest and the documentation slip said Khaki, however, the color is Olive Drab Green. Is this vendor color blind? I kept mine because my trip is imminent but I will never buy another product from them again. I believe a customer should receive the product color that they order.There was another post here that mentioned that the customer was at first putoff because they anticipated getting a more beige one which in fact would have been Khaki more than likely. I hope you have better luck but I would keep my fingers crossed."
5,Detailed source,"A very detailed source on the Islamic armies of the Second and Third Crusades, focusing on the Ayyubids of Salah al-Din but also examining the Fatimids, the Seljuks, and other Turkish factions. Helps dispel some myths and stereotypes about medieval Eastern warfare and shows how, in many respects it was connected to that of Europe."
3,Well written but biased,"Saladin and the Saracens is a solid enough effort. Written by Osprey's in-house muslim apologist, David Nicolle, it gives a decent enough portrayal of Saladin and the armies he led during the Crusading era. It concentrates primarily on the Fatimid and Ayyubids and Abbasid dynasties of the moslem middle east. A thumbnail sketch of the Mamelukes is also thrown in for good measure.As with most Osprey titles it is only meant to be used as a starting point, a general overview from which more serious study can then be undertaken.The prints are certainly of high quality, much, much better than some of Osprey's other crusader era titles.Again, as a jumping off point this book is a decent enough effort."
2,The Army of Shalahuddin was not presented enough,"The Saracens were not the whole picture of Shalahuddin's army. I only wished that western 'scholars' would start using Arabic grammar for their names in islamic history for the sake of respect of others.I found that his 'fire-brigade' that harrassed King Guy in the famous Battle of Hattin was not even presented. even his legendary 'light-cavalry' was not there either. Although, the uses of darts, short arrows, were there excellently enough.I was a little bit disappointed with this work, that's something unusual from david Nicolle. Fortunately I found several new accounts from the Saracens which did not all campaigned with Shalahuddin."
1,Uncomfortable,"The speakers don't stay snug against your ear canal, and the ear clip is uncomfortable. Bad design."
1,Junky,"I'm glad I did not pay much for these, because I threw them away after two uses. I bought them to save space in my carry-on during my last vacation. I should have stuck with bigger ones that worked better. I could not get the bud to stay in my ear, even the over-ear clip did not help - these things are made for people with HUGE ears."
2,No bass!,"I was hoping these would be decent for wearing while running but I'm already really disappointed after listening to them for five minutes. They have no bass. They don't come close to the random Sony earbuds I have sitting on my desk at work - even when plugging into my laptop's cruddy headphone jack the difference between them is huge and unacceptable. Without bass they just accentuate the flaws in compressed audio.Ergonomically they might be comfortable, but I haven't logged the time to tell. They certainly feel like they'll stay on through most activities."
3,decent sportclip headphones,as a regular walker who uses a mp3 player i am fairly happy with my Koss sportclip phones...buying them from Amazon at a great price was a big incentive to get them..the ear buds are not adjustable and i have a little problem getting them to be close enough to hear the moderate bass that these phones provide..the clarity is very good and overall when i finally break this product i will purchase another one....
4,Benjamin Bunny,"My 2 year old loves this story she calls it, the bunny's friend book. She enjoys this story more than Peter Rabbit. I think that the story is more eventful than Peter Rabit; and it is nice that the bunnies get to finish their adventure. I have read hundreds of stories to my daughter and we both find this one enjoyable my 5 month old also seems to enjoy it. She likes the colorful pictures. I guess you could say that everyone is happy when this story is chosen. If you like Peter Rabbit you'll like Benjamin Bunny."
3,Costs a dollar and it's almost worth it,"Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit became a classic on the strength of its illustrations, and on that most important point, this Dalmation Press edition fails.As with my review of Dalmation's release of the original story (The Tale of Peter Rabbit), I must point out that the color on the illustrations here is not optimal, either. Perhaps not quite as over-saturated and ""wet"" as in that other review, but still blurry. Perhaps the result of too much enlargement?This cheap paperback comes with cheap thin covers and cheap stapled binding. Still, it cost a buck. (We may have bought it from Target's Dollar Spot.) And it provides a fuller telling of the story than some truncated editions. That means your child will enjoy such gems as:""Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch."" (!!)"
2,The Tale of Benjamin Bunny,"I was very disappointed with this edition and did not give it to the Benjamin for whom it was intended. I probably did not read the description carefully enough, but I was expecting the small, hardcover copy with colored illustrations that I used to buy for my son. This copy is very dull, the illustrations are in black and white and the cover is paperback. I will have to look elsewhere for a more interesting copy."
4,Solved Dilema,"I was invited to a baby shower and was asked to provide a children's book along with my gift.The expected baby is to be named Benjamin,so this was a perfect choice..The book was smaller than I expected."
1,Poor excuse for craftsmanship,"This bell arrived, and I set about installing it as shown, dangling from its belt spring. The problem? A customer would have to slam the door with enough force to break the glass to get the bell to ring. The clapper inside is much too small for a bell that is supposed to ring with the minimum jiggling that it would get from a door opening and closing. I had to remove the bell from the spring, re-attach it with some copper wire to make it dangle better, and then find a replacement clapper to get any type of ring out of the thing.Also, the holes drilled into the band spring were crooked and therefore the bell lists off to one side.Don't waste $20 on this poorly constructed product."
5,Bell works like a charm.,The bell works fine. Very clear. We couldn't get the mouting bracket to work with the door so we took it off and zip tied it to the door hinge.
1,Piece of junk,One or two swipes with this broom and the handle starts unscrewing and twirls the broom all over the place. Then you have to stop sweeping and screw the handle back on. Now do this a dozen times before you've finished sweeping the kitchen and you'll be ready to throw this useless piece of junk out.
5,A Must Read,This was a great book that I would recommend for anyone pursuing a professional career and it doesn't matter in what field of work. There is politics in everything!!
1,Has a huge liberal bias!,"Waste of money! Try to borrow the book if you can, do not buy this! Its contents declare war on conservatism while simultaneously flattering liberals all the while."
3,alright,The book is acceptable. I am somewhat satisfied with the price and with the product. I might consider buying more products from here.
5,Served its purpose,used this book because I didn't want to spend a lot on the current version for my class... Served its purpose. Got an A.
5,Ibrik,"This ibrik works beautifully for making Greek coffee. I never need more than a cup, so this is the perfect size (though I can actually get 2 cups out of it). Came with instructions on how to make Greek coffee too, as well as a little bit of the history behind it. The fact that it's brass means it's durable and doesn't tarnish easily. It takes longer to heat up than a stainless or copper one would, but with Greek coffee heating slower makes for a better cup. Functional and pleasant to look at as well. The wooden handle keeps you from burning yourself (some ibriks do have metal handles). I'd definitely buy from Natasha's Cafe again."
2,Ibrik review,"I now know better...Product was flimsy and difficult to clean. Not good for coffee. Product smelt strongly of brass. Not good for coffee.For a superior ibrik, I recommend the buyer may look for elsewhere.I quickly threw the unit to the trash."
2,Portable but volume isn't adequate,"I purchased the product because I am hard of hearing in one ear; I use a digital hearing aid in that ear. My Gateway Notebook computer deosn't put out enough volume when I'm watching and listening to a movie on it. So I looked for headphones that have volume adjustments; this one had the beter reviews and was reasonably priced. Bottom line: it fits nicely in my bag when folded but even the slightest ambient noise wipes out any advantage of the volume control, which gives very little boost in volume."
2,Cheaply made,"I am somewhat disappointed with these headphones, based on the reviews I was expecting better, but they seem cheaply made and flimsy, I feel like they could break really easily. They are also surprisingly quiet, on both my computer and my ipod I have to turn up the volume almost all the way on both the device and the headphones to get reasonable sound out of them, and I don't have hearing problems. They also just kind of fall off my head if I look down. The sound quality is okay, but like I said, they are pretty quiet, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, you'd do better with a pair of ear buds that you would pay less for."
3,Ear pads fall off,"I really like these head phones. As a matter of fact, I have bought many pairs in spite of the fact of a what I believe is a major ear pad flaw that I continue to experience. After a few months of daily use, the ear pads stretch and start falling off. Eventually they will no longer fit because they are to big. I've purchased a number of replacement ear pads with no luck in finding the right fit. Yet, like I said, I like these headphones so much that I continue to replace them with the same. I always purchase a back-up pair in anticipation of the ear pad problem I know will eventually occur. I'm placing an order today for two more pairs!"
5,Comfortable and good volume,"These headphones are comfortable and fit well on my head without sliding all over. When I take them off, you really can't hear the sound coming out of them, so it won't bother people around you. I am currently listening to the radio on my computer with my computer volume set at only 1/3 volume and I can hear my music perfectly fine despite somebody blasting the TV just 10 feet away. Unlike some other reviewers, I notice a significant difference when using the volume control on the wire. In fact, I was afraid that I might accidentally bump the volume and scare myself so I decided to turn the wire setting all the way up and adjust on my computer instead (unlikely that I would actually adjust the volume control by accident - it would be pretty hard to accidentally bump the control).I have only been using them for a day, but these will work well for me with light use at the library."
3,Know this B/4 you buy...,"Eclectic collection of various artists features pristine sound. However,this is a promo disc.(not meant for sale) A smooth voiced female narrator will announce artist and song title at the conclusion of each track. You will be living with this intrusion upon every play."
5,Great music!,I cannot compete with these other reviews. :-) I first heard them along with the likes of AFI and Blue October. I don't know where they went but their music is great!
3,Lacking.,"I have long been a fan of Mr. Grant's books. He has been the most prolific Classicist author of the 20th century. This one is the first that I found lacking. Considering all the sources sighted in the large bibliography, this book should have been twice as long. There is little here that has not been said before. There is no discussion of Archaeology, and the original source materials. It provides little more than quotations, without in depth explanations. He did succeed in revealing how crucial the fifth century was in the transition to the Middle Ages. However, he did not actually answer the question he posed. That is, ""why did the western Empire breakup, while the Eastern or Byzantine half survived?"" I give it 3 stars for sentiments sake."
2,Disappointly derivative,"A friend bought this book for me from AMAZON. Michael Grant is an excellent historian but even excellent historians can produce nasty potboilers. This is one. FROM ROME TO BYZANTIUM basically consists of a series of quotes (many from other books by Michael Grant, a few from other standard histories of the period) with some linking passages to hold the thing together. I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends. But a far better short history of the 5th century AD - despite its unfortunate occasional descents into religiosity - is Perowne's END OF THE ROMAN WORLD."
2,Buy the regular mouse and a better sander,"I wore this unit out in less than 90 days. The RO sanding base lost its hooks, the mouse base broke, the dust control unit fell off and the finger attachment wouldn't stay in place. I returned it, bought the little mouse and a better RO sander and spent the same amount of money. It was an appealing idea to get all of those tools in one, but the whole package doesn't stand up to more than light duty."
1,black decker 4-1 multi sander ms700,"Sander okay for small sanding project. Dust collector fell off after first use. Once supplied sandpaper with kit is used, it is impossible to locate additional paper."
2,Mega Mouse is not a useful sander.,"I bought the original Mouse sander and it worked very well for the money. This mega mouse sander has the same comfortable grip as the original but it simply lacks the power, the durability and the shape to tackle bigger jobs. I have gone right back to my belt sanders ( my favorite belt sander is my Porter-Cable )My other problem with the mega mouse is that the accessories are so expensive. Check the cost of the accessories if you plan to use this sander a lot."
2,Buy something else,"Fortunately a roomate left this behind so I did not purchase it, but it was barely used. The first time I used it the iron shaped plate, it melted and broke where it attached. I followed the directions so I don't think I did anything wrong. The Dust collector has never collected any dust. I have used it for a few more projects just as an orbital sander, but now the Velcro on the round plate has started coming off, which after some research, I have found is a common problem. I suppose I could buy a replacement part for it, but I think I'll just buy a dewalt sander interwar. It doesn't polish, but we use one at work regularly with abuse and they've never given us any trouble and the dust collector works!"
3,Pretty good,"Being an Aldous Huxley fan, when I found this at the library I picked it up. It's a recollection of a man who lived in the house of an absent-minded genius with a gorgeous wife and dramatic daughter. The philosophies the man spits out at the beginning are interesting, and the story is worth a read. I wasn't blown away by the book, but it fared fine. It's a quick read, so check it out at the library like I did if you are a Huxley fan, if not, don't go out searching for it."
5,Awesome for teenage chicas,"This book was excellently compiled by Julia De Villers. ""Teen Girlfriends"" is made up of real experiences and thoughts of real girls. It's a great read - you can relate to a lot of the stories, etc. I definitely think you should try reading this book. I'm actually in it!! (My name's Arielle, on pg. 9 & pg. 65-66)Check it out!!"
3,"Great articles, but an incomplete book","This book was created by gluing together the famous ""Paranoid Penguin"" columns that the author writes for Linux Journal. Now, the articles are great. When expanded into book form, there's more space available for detail. However this book doesn't have the breadth to be a good security book on it's own. Since it only pulls from the articles, it misses many key points that would be necessary for someone to really secure their machine. Many of the topics here are not geared toward securing your machine, or building a secure server at all - they're more ""how to do things securely"". Now that is a good thing, but the book title makes it sound like you need only this book to build a secure machine, and that is definately not the case."
3,Wears blinders.,"This book, like the horse on the cover, is wearing blinders and can only see straight ahead. In this case, straight ahead is the assumption that you need only worry about the topics the author decides to cover.Now what Bauer discusses is explained well and very throroughly, as well as any other book on the subject. However there are many pieces of your overall security situation that need to be included in a security book. For example the utter lack of anything about physical security is unforgivable, given how many people will be colocating Linux servers.The book relies on graphical tools too often - if you're building a server, you should *NOT* be installing X11 on it! More command line activities would be better."
2,never recieved camera.,"Item never arrived. Was moving and needed item on time. Seller would not respond to my email attempts. I had to order camera from other seller. Fortunately, Amazon stood by the claim process and promptly had my money refunded. I still trust Amazon, but not the store who posted this camera for sale. Thank you Amazon for standing by your reputation. :)"
3,Throw Away,Great little camera for the 3 years it lasted. It broke a couple of weeks ago: the lens is stuck in the open position & it won't turn on. I've tried other new batteries to no avail. Polaroid says they do not repair them and they have no forums or web site to go to for help.
4,battery life,"GOOD PRICE, GOOD CAMERA; HOWEVER, THE MEMORY CARD PROVIDED WAS DID NOT FUNCTION AND HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE."
5,"Great camera, great value!!!","I looked at many cameras and many reviews before choosing this camera. I was drawn to its looks initially, but didn't want to get stuck with a lemon just because it was a pretty color. After lots of research, I decided to try it out.The first pictures that I took with it were of some farm land right at dusk with the sun already behind a mountain. I used the ""Night"" mode and the pictures looked as though we were there in bright daylight! Even distant items stood out with great color and clarity.It also has modes for portraits, children, sunsets, and so much more! I still can't believe how many features this camera has for the money.The only thing that it lacks is a strong zoom, but, face it: that's what runs the price up on a lot of cameras. This camera gives you a whole lot of features at about half the price of other 7mp cameras.THIS IS THE BEST ELECTRONICS PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!!"
5,Polaroid 7MP DC Pink,"Polaroid 7MP Dc PinkWe bought this camera as a birthday gift for our 20 yr. old daughter. She loves it! It's easy to use and takes beautiful pictures. It didn't come with a battery charger, so we got her a battery charger and a couple sets of AA batteries. Taking film clips seemed to use up the charge fairly quickly. We recommend this camera."
2,Great camera... when it works.,"Bought one for my ten year old. First few days it was fine. Then all the pictures had a purple tint. Sent it back for a replacement, which gives a ""card error"" when I insert the memory card. (Tried two 4GB cards and got the same error, but no errors on an old 2GB card.) Turns out that it can only use cards 1GB or smaller... pretty weird for 2009!"
2,not so hot,"I bought this as a replacement camera...my daughters broke my easy share. I thought it was okay at first. However it does the annoying double flash, pictures turn out way too washed out and bright no matter what and it is a battery sucker....and it is a little heavy for my taste, kinda bulky.Pros....it has a rubberized outer shell, if you drop it no biggie and if it floats around your bag..no scratches.only pro about the rubberized-ness is that I had the camera in a new leather bag with black lining and the color transfered on to the camera, I have no idea how to get it off.I am upgrading once again and hopefully for the last time to a Nikon and giving this to my 5yr old."
4,Gulda Back in the Day,"In this era of homogenized classical collections, it is great that Testament continues to rescue gems from the vaults of labels like Decca and reissue them on CD. This disc presents pianist Friedrich Gulda performing two Piano Concertos by Mozart and a Piano Sonata by Beethoven. Long ago, Gulda left the classical scene to explore a (mediocre, in my opinion) career in jazz. This title takes us back to the vintage, pre-jazz Gulda on two first-rate late mono performances (1955) of Mozart's 25th and 26th Piano Concertos with Anthony Collins leading the New Symphony Orchestra. The set concludes with a 1958 stereo recording of the 22nd Beethoven Piano Sonata. This is the type of disc collectors eagerly anticipate from Testament, but I'm withholding a fifth star because it is hard to ask the average fan to pay full-price for historical sessions. In all though, this disc is yet another ""testament"" to a great reissue program."
3,eh i dunno,"Not as good as I thought it was. The first JU-ON is an original, this one reminds me so much of the american remake. This is worth a watch, but not a buy, I feel i kind of wasted my money on it, but whatever. Rent it, if you like it enough, buy it."
1,just ridiculous,"First, let me say that I quite enjoyed Ju-On. Though it didn't suspend my disbelief as it could have, it definitely was very creepy, interesting, and a worthwhile experience overall. But Ju-On2 is just bad. The acting usually isn't bad, but the effects and makeup are no better than comical. (I can't help but giggle every time I think about the scene in which the two were hanged by the hair of a phantasm that resides in the ceiling.) The development of the story is boring, and the story itself is derivative. As soon as I became tired of laughing at the spectacle on my television, I was very bored and ultimately ended up watching another movie."
5,"Now it Makes Sense, Now I know why I can not please my wife.","If ever some was confused it was me. I tried to be a great husband. But if I said one thing, it was wrong, and if I said the opposite it was wrong. I am a man, and was so surprised when I read this book. My love, my wife, had been helping a friend through abuse, and then I saw a book by Patricia Evans, so I thought ""Here is a book for her to use"". I picked it up. Wow it was my life. She lied to me. She redefined me. She manipulated me. I took about 3 months to read the book, it hurt so much to see my long term love in this ugly light. Patricia Evans helped me so much and now I am free, to Love me properly."
5,you are not alone or crazy!!!! read this book,"This book is great for those who are survivors, and those who want to get out of an abusive relationship. I found myself crying tears of joy reading this book, because I realized that I was not crazy and that I was not alone. I recognized myself in its stories. Read it, heal with it, carry it around, and live by it. It can help you change your life and help you heal from this misunderstood and hidden abusive cyle.I also highly reccomend her other books. The reason that so many of these reviews have the same words in them, I am guessing, is that victims of verbal abuse go through the same things, and then feel the same way. It is amazing. Only other survivors can understand."
5,Well done,This is worth the read if you have the problem. Well written - not much help but easy to see how this issue affects others.
1,Too many unanswered questions!,This book would be much more helpful if it had more facts in the examples.
3,Is there some reason the book can't stand on its own merits?,"(The ""3 stars"" is not an actual evaluation; it was a required field that needed to be completed to convey the rest of the message)This is actually a review of the reviewers. I noticed that reviewers from Nashville and Denver managed to give personal testimonies that had too many word-for-word identical phrases too be accounted for by coincidence. It smells like a scam to me... like some author or PR person is doing promotion. If these are actually to separate readers with no conflict of interest, and you actually want to help other potential readers, I invite you to identify yourselves--and at least one of you needs to take the time to use your own words if you want to actually share your own perspective. Actually, if you are the author or a PR person masquerading as a reader, I also invite you to idetnify your self."
3,Average and generic,"I've been searching for some really good lighting books to provide some insight into different methods of working with light and was excited to receive this book. When I got it and flipped through, I was over run with standard stock and uninteresting images.While the copy is good, and pretty detailed, the concepts are pretty mundane. If you are looking for a book with average key lighting techniques, as well as close lighting ratios (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) then this book is for you. If you are looking for some fo the more fine art effects, (Drastic lighting ratios, smoothing of skin, etc.) I'd look to another book.One reviewer mentioned that they were drawn to the book by the cover photograph. This photograph is great and has a fine dramatic lighting set up, there are maybe one or two more in the book on par with this one (style wise), but not much."
5,Tears of injustice not heard by land of the free!,So moving 5 people tell their tales of injustice and spending time on death row just waiting. This story can be heard in any country. But the police where ever can have so much power and just do whatever they fancy. Scary. This just tells there tales as if speaking to you. Its embarrassing their pain is our entertainment but so needs to be heard to so we dont let our boys in blue repeat the mistake.The tragedy of belonging to human animals and not be believed!
4,"Powerful, political film that humanizes an issue","Intelligent, mostly well acted filming of the stage play, as 6 people exonerated from death rowtell their true stories, mostly as monologues, against a black background.A powerful argument against the death penalty, it feels a bit stuck between embracing it'stheatricality of approach, and trying to work as a more cinematic piece both in the way itsshot, the occasional awkward `flashbacks' and in the `size' of the performances, which rangefrom understated and small to quite theatrical and presentational.But whatever questions one might have about the stylistic choices, there's no question thatthese are powerful, important true stories in that every rarer thing, a dramatized American film thathead on addresses an issue with passion and intelligence."
3,"Disappointing, made no sense without seeing series","I personally think that the Rahxephon series is the best anime series out there, however I was very disappointed with the movie. It was just a cut and paste of the original animation with little snipets inserted here and there. The story made no sense unless you had seen the series first. I understand that they were trying to condense 26 episodes into a 2 hour movie, but they left too much out. They don't explain why he sees Mitsumi, they don't explain why he goes back to Tokyo Jupiter. They don't explain his friends in TJ or who they are. But they still added them. I think that the movie would have been much better and easier to understand if they would have reanimated the entire movie and made it started it over. If you have not seen the series watch it first then watch the movie."
1,disappointing,"I completely agree with greg goebel's review of this movie, but I wanted to add that if you haven't seen the series in its entirety you will have absolutely no idea what's going on. I saw the series a few months before the movie and I still couldn't figure out a lot of things from the movie. So if you're interested in anime definitely see the series, but only see the movie if you have time and money to waste."
1,Beyond Comprehension,"I still have the paperback I read when I was 13 way back in 1972. I found it in Mom's attic and guess what? It's worse now than it was all those years ago.Worthless characters, worthless plot, a lot of worthless psychobabble.Worthless then, more worthless now."
5,Love the added flavor it gives to my Tirimisu,Had trouble finding the product locally and was pleased to find it on line. Have used the powder in my famous Tirimisu and have added it to several other chocolate recipes to jazz up the flavor. It is remarkable how the taste improves when using the instant espesso powder.
2,Did not serve well as a pull toy,"Had been looking for a pull toy. This one tries to be both - stacking andpull toy - but it cannot be used as a pull toy because the dog/cat headskeep falling off. It may work as a stacking toy, were it not for thewheels and pull string.Good construction, but not what we were looking for.And the box print says recommended for 1+, but came witha sticker saying it should not be used for toddlers under 18 months,as it has ""potential of causing injury in area of throat""."
3,Misleading title,"I thought this would be a biography of Warwick by someone who actually met him, so I was very excited. Imagine my disappointment when Warwick's death occurred on page 30 after it became clear that de Comines never actually met him and got his information second or third hand. The rest of the book deals entirely with the political situation in France during the reign of Louis XI. If that is what interests you, you will enjoy this, but don't go into it expecting much about Warwick."
3,Review for Genealogy,"The book is only part of an entire work. It does give insight into the minds of the history makers of the time; and is particularly interesting as a first-person narrative. Because of a lack of dates, and references to other parts of the work, it is not a good source of genealogical information. Still, if your are interested in the history of the time, it is something you should read."
4,Disorderly,Wow. Interesting and new ideas on old thoughts. Worth the read. Can't say I agreed with her but her view was interesting.
2,What's up with the edits?,"Edits? Unbelievable! While the sound is much, much better on an A/B compare, that comparison also reveals that they changed two songs as pointed out by other reviewers. I thought I was going to get the exact same songs, in their entirety, as on the original recording, only remastered. I am disappointed that the choice was made to change ""What You're Missing"" and ""Love Me Tomorrow"". I'm surprised that they didn't include some lame DRM rootkit scheme or something to further throw salt into the wound."
1,Radio Edits,"Well Rhino does it again. The original album had full versions of What You're Missing and Love me Tomorrow.Both these songs are edited or radio versions, why?There's plenty of space on the CD.They could've had the full versions and have the radio edits as bonus tracks.Be careful when you buy Rhino especially the Pretenders box set with radio edits."
1,"never mind the MFA criticism, it's just tedious","Some reviews denigrate this book as the obvious product of an MFA degree I have no problem with an MFA product; I have an MFA in Creative Writing myself. But anyone with an MFA knows from the get-go to stay away from the topics of dogs and dreams! I'm too type A not to finish a book (this was on the shelf at a beach cottage) but it was tedious. Bizarre and boring on the topic of teaching a dog to talk, long-winded on tarot cards (unless you're into that... if you're not, a reader just wants to know the outcome), the tension is drawn out too long about the so-called ""mystery"" surrounding Lexy's death, and she herself is an unlikeable character. Read Joanna Trollope's Brother and Sister instead."
3,spoiler alert - Paul learns nothing,"If the narrator tells his story chrnologically, there's no mystery. Wifey's nuts, terrified of having children, dies. Suicide or accident? Autopsy: she's pregnant! So suicide, steak makes sense, story over.But Paul can't accept this, withdraws from reality, and takes it out on his dog. By the end he does accept Lexy's suicide, but never acknowledges his self-deception, nervous breakdown, or mistreatment of poor Lorelei.It's not badly written, although the criticisms of the narrator sounding too feminine are valid. It's interesting and unusual, but forced and ultimately unconvincing. A scientist who calls psychics? Give me a break."
2,Dog Lovers Beware,"I absolutely loved this book....until I got to the part about the dogs. I still can't get it out of my mind and have been feeling the urge to hug my dog ever since. It's a shame the author ruined what could have been a wonderful love story.Oh, and by the way, I wonder if Ms. Parkhurst is aware that neither dogs nor humans have the ability to swallow (and therefore eat) without a larynx????? I think she neglected some important research. Not only is the dog mutilation part of this book distasteful, it is also not factual."
2,"Cool idea, bad book","When I started reading this book I hoped it would be a cool mystery about how the narrator uncovers the truth of his wife's death with clues given by the only witness, their dog. Unfortunately the book was not nearly as neat as I thought it would be. The fact that the professor literally tries to get the dog to talk is just plain dumb. This book focuses way too much on that, and not enough on solving the mystery...which by the way turns out to be not mysterious at all. There is some stuff in the book about animal abuse, and as a huge animal lover, I was somewhat bothered, but it really isn't that bad. Also, I did not end up feeling anything for the characters. Lexy, the wife who dies, is self centered and basically psycho and Paul, the husband, is just plain boring.I finished this book, because I hate the idea of not finishing books, but it really wasn't worth my time."
4,no problems,the book is in great condition. i haven't read it yet but i look forward to it! it came promptly and with no issues.
4,Wonder and contemplation,"I admit that the cover art---the one with the mask---is what first drew me to this book. Next was the title: The Dogs of Babel. I love dogs, and the Tower of Babel story (as well as the idea of language) has always intrigued me. Together, the cover and title promise wonder and discovery, sensations which are delivered in full throughout the text.While some parts of the plot are less-than-believable, the storyline keeps the reader moving forward as the main character struggles not to slide backward. The dog, Lorelei, is perhaps the sturdiest character. Lexy's unpredictable and whimsical character is especially fascinating, partly because many aspects of her reside within me.This book has its ups-and-downs, both in writing style and in the plot. Altogether, it impresses a lasting indentation upon the reader's mind---it certainly left me contemplating for days after I closed the back cover."
5,Yet Another Today Show Winner!,"I have yet to be disappointed with the Today Show Book Club selections, Dogs of Babel is no exception.When I read the description of this book, I wondered what it would be like, would we be reading the dog's perspective? Would it have a bit of fantasy and would the dog really learn to talk? How would this author handle this premise, of a man whose wife has died and is now training his dog to speak?? Well, she actually handled it very well! She took a quirky premise and made it believable, understandable and real. She showed us a man grieving, who was willing to do anything to find out why his wife has died. She made you understand where he was coming from, and made you root for him a bit.I would definitely recommend this book to a friend. Like The Time Travelers Wife, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime and Crow Lake- Dogs of Babel is a jewel found for readers by the Today Show."
4,palpable grief,"Wonderful, takes you into Paul's love and grief. I read this book in hours and am glad I spend the time doing so."
1,Manipulative and one-dimensional,"The point of this book is to find out whether or not the wife's fall from a tree was accidental or suicidal. It is only at the very end that we're told that the husband knew two EXTREMELY important facts from the very beginning that were never shared with the audience. Had we known these facts when the husband did, there would be no mystery, and absolutely no story of any kind. It was an extremely manipulative thing to do and cheapened the entire story."
2,A Dog of a Book,"I had really high hopes for this book and there is a lot going for it. I enjoyed the writing style very much and it was a page turner. The problem was turning to the last chapter or two. What was initially a very engaging story with a unique premise got bogged down into absurdity. I won't give anything away, but the manner in which the character discovers how his wife died was so contrived it completely ruined the book for me, and then to assume that he ""discovers"" the manner of her death from such a contrivance made me re-read that page a few times to see if I missed something. Promising start, a ridiculous ending."
2,Section on Animal Cruelty Ruined My Love for this Story,"I was totally in love with this book and couldn't put it down...until I got to the section that others have mentioned about animal cruelty. I felt like I was floating through this whimsical unraveling of a tragic love story. Then I hit an unexpected wall with the descriptions of animal abuse.Dog lovers will be drawn to this book and, for me, to read this section really upset me and I did not recover at the end. It was a jolt to the tone of the book; and didn't seem in character for the protagonist...without giving away the plot, there is one decision in particular that he made that seems ludicrious and you immediately know what will happen.This chapter detracted from what would have been a great novel. It turned me off the book."
5,Highly Recommended-Wonderful Read!,"I recently bought my third copy of this book, because anyone I've loaned it to always seems to ""misplace"" it! The Dogs of Babel is firstly about a linguistics professor and widower who is trying to teach his dog speech to find out what happened the day she died. It ultimately is a wonderful story on love, relationships, and grief. It is told in a style that begs to be read out loud, and you can feel the author's love of language. Carolyn Parkhurst is a great storyteller and I would love to read more of her work."
4,Interesting and unique book,"I enjoyed reading the book. It was well written and I couldn't put it down. It's nice to read a book that is original and I found that I cared about the characters in the book. However, my book club decided that the ending didn't ring true. It's worth reading, though, especially if you are a dog lover."
2,Interesting premise falls short in execution,"This book held my attention until around page 100. Until then, it was an intersting, somewhat plausible story, but once it got into talking dogs and the experiments on them, I thought, ""This is too ridiculous!"" It wasn't the concept so much as its execution. I almost gave up, but plodded through the next 30 pages or so, and then finished it because I wanted to see how it came out. This book got a lot of hype (which is why I got it), but I don't know why. It's mediocre, though a quick read. I did like how Parkhurst went back and forth, one chapter in the present, the next chapter in the past, and so on."
1,Big disappointment,"...I...bought this book because I am a huge fan of Anna Quindlen. After finishing the book, I also wondered why in the world Quindlen would recommend this novel. The characters are unsympathetic and unbelievable, particularly Lexy. Frankly, I found myself not caring that Lexy had died. My reaction to this book was totally different from Lovely Bones, another novel about death that Quindlen recommended. Read Lovely Bones instead."
4,Can Dogs Talk?,"A college professor is on a mission to teach his dog to talk. He feels that if the dog could talk, it could tell him about the last day of his wife's life when she mysteriously fell from an apple tree.It sounds ridiculous, but Parkhurst makes you feel that the professor has at least some validity in his quest other than pure grief.I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it highly. It's intelligent and fun to read."
3,Not Like The Lovely Bones,"Why was this book compared to The Lovely Bones? I heard that and expected this book to be about someone from the afterlife trying to communicate back to the current people on earth. I guess whenever there is a best-seller or a popular movie, people think they can promote a new book or movie by claiming that it's the next Harry Potter, or the next Big Fat Greek Wedding.Anyway, after feeling misled and actually reading the book for what it was, it wasn't too bad. In fact, there was point where I was horrified at the thought of what would happen next in the story and that added some suspense for me. It was enjoyable to slowly get to know the wife via flashback and see that there was more to the story than initially laid out - I believe they call that How The Story Unfolds."
3,Give the dog a bone...,"Like many others, I read this book with high hopes and great expectations. Then, I actually read it. I agree with many others that the writing style and pacing were very good, but the story structure completely undermined it, for me. I've read a few mentions of ""contrived"". I couldn't agree more.I did enjoy that she chose Lorelei to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback (since we have one) - but a breed especially known for NOT barking!"
1,Pass this one up,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot is inane. The only sympathetic character is the dog. Lexy is a spoiled, selfish, egocentric fleabrain, incapable of concern for anyone else--neither her husband nor her unborn child. The husband is fumbling, inept, and downright stupid. I was not affected by his pain, his loss--only by his selfishness. The parts on dog abuse upset and angered me, especially the husband's part in exposing his own dog to the horrors of the underground ""research"" group. The plot is silly, the ending a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Apparently it did not occur to either the professor or his wife to get help for her problems. The novel is somewhat appropriately named--it is a dog and it is babble."
2,Original but unconvincing,"I was at first drawn in by the novel's delightfully absurd premise: a linguistics professor in mourning tries to teach the family dog, Lorelei -- the only witness to his wife's assumed suicide -- how to speak English. But I stumbled as Parkhurst fell (often comically) short of writing in a masculine voice. Paul Iverson, the narrator, is a very unconvincing man-in-mourning, and often unconvincing as a man at all, using descriptors like ""prettily"" and ""lovely,"" and so often saying things so decidedly feminine (""I sink into the memory as if it were a warm bath"") that I could never get into the narrative itself. I had high hopes, but the Dogs of Babel failed to speak to me on any level.To read more reviews check out Void Magazine's website."
4,Worth a read...,"Parkhurst to me, evokes the feelings I have when I read such authors as Atwood, Hoffman or Coehlo. To me, a novel such as this is less about the beginning, middle and end and more about the words in between. Its in the little details. Lexy painting ""I Love You"" along the kitchen walls, which only glimmered in the morning sun for Paul to see. Paul and Lexy's first date... a wedding where everyone wore a mask she made. I sometimes felt like I was reading someones diary... and that to me is true character development."
1,"Absurd premise, unlikeable characters","I had quite a different reaction to this book compared to other reviewers. Before the premise even revealed itself, I found the description of the romance corny -- along the lines of a bad movie on the Lifetime Channel.And, without giving too much away of the plot, let's just say I am an ear, nose, and throat surgeon and I can tell you that the author did absolutely no medical research for the veterinary/surgical portion of the book. The last straw was when one of the dogs supposedly had a laryngectomy (larynx removed) and had nothing more than a band-aid on its neck. Even if you ignore the fact that it takes 5 years of surgical residency to learn this procedure, once a larynx is removed a tracheostomy is required or the animal would not have an airway! Come on....put a modicum of effort into researching for your writing."
4,"Unique, Enjoyable Book","I enjoyed this book very much. It held my interest from start to finish. And it wasn't one of those overly-sappy stories that play on your emotions. It shows what an otherwise healthy individual might do in the wake of grief. And it shows what an individual who is healthy enough to see that she is somewhat unhealthy might do when faced with a difficult decision regarding something that would effect others.I am a die-hard animal lover. Yes, the animal cruelty section was upsetting, but if you read the author's note in the back of the book, she does note that she realizes some might find it upsetting. It needed to be part of the story--to show how far down Paul could have gone because of his grief--but he stopped himself.This book had great symbolism, too."
1,"The sort of book that stays with you, but not in a good way","This book was one of those I had to keep reading, even though I didn't want to. The author is a great writer, but the subject matter left something to be desired. There were parts of it that absolutely haunted me, especially about the mutilated dogs. I wanted to know what happened, but I wish I had never read the book. I can't get it out of my mind. Don't read this book *especially* if you are a dog lover. The fact that the main character could even remotely identify with these dog butchers made it absolutely impossible for me to feel for him in the main story about his wife's death..which was a bit bizzare in and of itself, but a good story. My best advice is don't start reading this book, because you'll have to finish, and you'll probably be sorry you did."
4,Obsession and dogs,"Professor loses wife in mysterious accident. Only witness is the couple's dog, Lorelei. Professor becomes obsessed with finding out what the dog knows and decides to teach Lorelei to ""speak"". And just like any character in literary history that becomes obsessed, he loses sight of what is important in life.The book alternates telling the story of how the couple met and fell in love, and the plan to communicate with Lorelei. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes, esp. for us dog lovers. I flew through this book in 4 hours. A very entertaining read. One scene set in New Orleans during Mardi Gras featuring a mask spooked me as well as any horror novel. Non-dog lovers may not appreciate this book as much, but I recommend it to all."
3,Read with your dog near by!,"The bottom line is that this is a good story but I would have liked more details about the characters. I did not really get to know them. However, if you have an animal companion this book will at one point give you nightmares while guaranteeing your dog loads of hugs and attention. Your dog will be glad you took the time to finish the book."
2,Good ending to a rather sketchy project,"Unlike many other readers, I found most of this novel fairly boring- with its ridiculous characters, one-dimensional emotions, and pop culture sense of the world, it does indeed seem as if a high school student penned it. And yet, I stuck with, hoping to find the reason it has been hyped so much in the press and by readers here. For me, the ending, far from being gratuitous or as one animal fan put it, ""cruel,"" is the only part of the book that is worthwhile, that does live up to the hype. Through the underground we at last confront something moving, living, and powerful."
1,A Creepy Book,"Though I will not deny that this book is well written, it is, nevertheless, creepy. I had to skip over a few parts about the graphic dog abuse. I couldn't find warmth or depth in the characters. They were just too bizarre for me. After reading other reviews on this book, I am aware that it has moved some readers to tears. For me, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I bought it for $3.00 at a used book store and am planning to give it back to them for free. I don't want the negative energy hanging around my house. I'm left to wonder what has happened to our society to make so many people love this truly weird, unbelievable story."
3,Strange Brew,"An interesting take on grief and conflicted love, but two of the main characters (Lexy and Paul) are bound to get on your nerves. Lorelie is the only one who is written ""true""; maybe Parkhurst is a dog person to the bone (uh, no pun intended; okay, maybe a little). Lexy is volatile/fragile and Paul is clueless/clueless (OMG, is this guy a doofus), yet the premise is so original that I kept going back to see what would happen. However, the segment involving the Cerberus Society was so hamhanded, hackneyed and fraught with the worst sort of stereotyping that I had trouble taking the novel seriously after running into it. The resolution might leave you saying, ""And about time, too!"""
3,Depressing,"This book was okay. At first I got really into it, but it got very slow and was too depressing. I don't know how anyone could have standed Lexy, she seemed like a woman who needed a shrink of some sort. Though it was an easy read, I couldn't help but think days after I read it about if something like that ever happened to someone in my family.I also don't really get why it was called the 'Dogs of Babel'. the only reason I can think is because the fortune teller talking about the dog and the fool. I don't want to give it away for those who haven't read it. Anyway, I guess I'll understand it better when I'm older."
1,My copy is in the trash! Don't bother with this book!,"Gratuitous and frightful descriptions of animal abuse do nothing but add to the horror of a deseperate suicide survivor's search for answers. I hate, hate, hate this book. HATE!It is disingenuous to put Dog in the title of this book. It should be titled ""Suicide Babble"". I was lured into the book by Dog in the title like candy to a child molestation victim. Terribly self conscious writing.Please don't read it. If you have a heart, you will be sorry."
1,Miserable and Disturbing Read For Animal Lovers,"I would give this book zero stars if possible. I hated this book. It started out slow, predictable in its dialogue, and then I realized that the gloomy and depressing ""climax"" of this book is animal torture.If you are sensitive to animal suffering, don't bother reading this atrocity- it will give you nightmares and add to your thoughts of how sick the world really is. There are so many wonderful books to read- don't squander your precious time on this shameful garbage."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I agree with the review that says this novel is predictable, and I'd like to add that it's very sappy. The dialogue between him and his wife seemed made up and unnatural, and her character wasn't consistent.I decided to read this book because I was lured in by the idea that he was going to find some secret unknown canine language. But it more explores this man's feelings about his deceased wife. It goes back and forth from past to present: (past - he reminsces of his wife and their relationship and present - trying to find the mystery of her death), but the ""mystery"" was very predicatable. By the time I reached the end, there was no ""ah-ha!"". After I finished this book, I felt very dissatisfied, like I'd wasted a week of my life on this let-down of a novel."
1,Disgusting,This is a disgusting book and I did not read the whole thing. I could not read past the animal abuse stuff. The author must be some sort of weird person. I have destroyed the book.
4,"Here's the question,though.",What is the connection of the title to the story? Not one reviewer (professional or general reader) ever expanded on that thought. Why did the writer choose the title?
4,Worth reading,"This is a book well worth reading. The plot is original and intriguing.After Paul learns of his wife's death, he goes on a mission to find out what really happened. Looking for clues in his house to learn about Lexy's fall, he turns to the only witness, the family dog. His mission earns him ridicule from his colleagues, gets him involved with criminals, and makes him spend countless hours on the phone talking to strangers.This is an interesting book, however, I only give it 4 stars since some of the clues and plot are a little predictable. If you pay attention, you will figure out Lexy's faith before Paul does. Still, it is a book well worth reading."
4,Sad and emotional book,"I read The Dogs of Babel in two days. It is about a man who suffered the loss of his wife who fell out of a tree in his backyard with his dog as the only witness to her death. As a reader, you will sincerely connect with the characters and feel for Paul. This book really touched my heart. It is interesting, sad, funny at times, and a great read in general. The plot may seem outlandish, a man trying to teach his dog to talk, but it is his desperation and need to find solace that touched me so deeply. I would definately recommend this book."
5,I had to say something...,"I don't usually go to the trouble of writing a review for the books I read. I'd rather people read them and make up their own minds, and I rarely have insight that might be helpful to other readers. But this book touched me so deeply that I had to say something about it. The combination of joy and despair, charm and depth, and the ability to amuse you and break your heart at the same time is very rare. This book has it. I can't remember the last time a novel made me cry. It wasn't Paul's grief that touched me (though it did) as much as Lexy's, because I can identify so deeply with the elation of life while at the same time being in so much pain.I don't want to overdo it here - I think you get the point. I highly recommend this book, but it's not for everyone."
1,A dog,"I rarely review books on Amazon, or anywhere else, but this book is so bad, I felt obligated to warn people. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are poorly drawn and tedious, and the prose is alternately banal and pretentious. How did this book get so many good reviews? A cult that mutilates dogs in an effort to get them to talk? A woman who climbs a tree and jumps out of it as a way of killing herself? The stupid trip to Disney World. The paper mache mask nonsense. The silliness about rearranging the books. The whole thing with the psychic. Silly, boring and utterly uncompelling."
2,A horribly conceived book,"Come on people, don't you want even a little more from your reading experience than this load of sentimental nonsense? Terrible characters (especially Lexy, who never comes across as a real person -- too plucky and kooky by half), and a horrible plot involving Frankenstein-ian surgeries on dogs to get them to speak like humans. Read the review below written by a medical doctor if you don't believe me -- what happens in this plot is incredible and gross and silly. I never got a sense that the narrator felt much for his dog, and I could care less about how his wife did herself in (I could see the answer to this question coming a mile away -- all those 'kooky' little character traits. So irritating). One of the worst plots I've read in a long time, a close second to 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell', but mercifully much shorter."
2,WARNING: DEEPLY DISTURBING TO ANIMAL LOVERS,"If you're an animal lover who is repulsed by scenes of animal cruelty, avoid this book at all costs. Although it's billed as a moving novel about grief and the bonds of love, those themes are overshadowed by the graphic (although highly implausible) theme of surgical animal mutilation. The animal cruelty that you dismiss as only a passing reference at the beginning of the book blossoms into a critical plot point that made me want to vomit with disgust. I couldn't sleep after I read it.Can't stand reading about the occasional animal-cruelty story in the newspaper? Do yourself a favor and skip this book: there are plenty of similar novels out there that won't turn your stomach."
2,"Babel, Babel","The book is OK, wouldn't recommend it. It's a nice love story between husbad and wife and, of course, the dog. The dog cruelty is upsetting."
1,one of the worst books I have ever read,"This book represented everything I hate in a book. First, the writing was terrible: it was hollow, the author asked rhetorical questions, she answered rhetorical questions, and the characters congratulated each other on the depth of their wisdom (which is really the wisdom, or lack of it, of the author). Second, the plot was about a person who suffered the kind of ""tragedy"" that most people will have to face sometime in their lives, in fact many times in their lives, but the book portrayed this as something greater and rarer than that. At least the dog didn't learn how to talk. That would have been unbearable."
2,Unfortunate,"I really wanted to like this book, but I really, really didn't. The premise is interesting - it sounded a bit John Irving-esque - but the execution was just bad. Though this is purportedly a love story, the characters are flat and lifeless, and I felt no empathy for them or their story. The character of Lexy appeared to be trying too hard (I think I met her in a women's studies class in college). And I felt as though the author was terribly manipulative in the way in which she described the relationship between the couple. None of it seemed real. I kept waiting, but the book never really got worth reading."
3,A wonderful story,"When I first picked up the book, I had no idea what to expect, and the first few chapters where very interesting and drawed the reader in. But what happened next was a roller coaster ride of a mourning person's feelings and emotions in being left behind. I do agree that if you love animals that there is some parts of this story that will upset you. But the overall book is wonderful, and it reminds me of Lovely Bones, in the fact that it shows how people deal with death after their loved ones are gone."
5,Amazing,"A *beautifully* written story about grief, coping, love, and the effects of depression. I read constantly, and this is the first story in ages that has had a strong effect on me. It is, as others have said, incredibly sad, but it is told with such amazing honesty that it's worth the tears you will, no doubt, shed."
4,A shot to the gut,"Stylistically, this book reminded me a lot of The Lovely Bones. However, The Lovely Bones took a couple weeks of gestation to really start to appreciate it, whereas this book pretty much hit me from the start. This is one of the saddest books I have ever read, and while I think anyone who has ever loved will find the heartbreak in this book wrenching, those who are married will find it nearly unbearable. In a good way."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","I found that I couldn't put this book down. I finished it in about 2 hours. More than anything, it was curiosity that kept me going, along with a morbid fascination with Paul's obsession. I just had to find out what really happened to Lexy and if Paul would ever get Lorelei to actually speak."
3,"Great premise, but a long road to nowhere...","This book started with an interesting premise, but ran out of gas at the end with no clear resolution - or better yet no satisfying resolution. It's more love story that mystery.Very well written however."
4,Definitely a story unlike any other...,"A dog is the only witness to a woman's mysterious death, and her grieving husband is determined to teach the dog to speak in order to learn what really happened. The story goes back to when the couple first met, chronicling their relationship from its happiest to its gradually more unhappy days, until it's determined what really happened to Lexy. It's an engrossing read, although I surmised from about the first twenty pages what the main character refuses to admit until the very end."
4,Very good!,"This is a book I got for Christmas. A pollyanna gift of different books. I would not have chosen it for myself, but I loved it!! I traded it around the office and it provoked many conversations on grief, the depths of grief, and finally, getting on with life. It was a very well written book. I would highly recommend it."
2,Only Mediocre,"The first one hundred pages were wonderful. I really enjoyed the authors writing style. I was so into it that I actually forgot that this was fiction. I was very disturbed by the discription of the Cerebus Society, the treatment of the animals, the description of Dog J, and what happens with Loreli. I felt that took away from my enjoyment of the book.This is a book that has a good concept, starts out well, but make a wrong turn in the middle that causes me to not enjoy it."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading all the favorable reviews of this book, I was in for a nasty surprise. I was drawn into the book immediately by its interesting premise, but it wasn't long before I began to be bothered by the voice of the narrator. The story is told in an imaginative and frothy voice that I was unable to accept as the voice of a man, and this is where the book fell apart for me. By the time he started calling the psychic hotline, I gave up on the book and will not go back. Paul Iverson is the least convincing male character I have ever encountered."
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed the book but never felt the urge to stay up all night reading. Parkhurst does a nice job with the narrative, but as another reviewer stated, I never felt much sympathy or empathy for the main characters. The book might have done a better job probing Paul's experience with grief. I did not feel that Lexy was drawn out to its fullest... in fact, I often found her trite and quite annoying. Maybe her battle with mental illness might have been exposed earlier - and with much more boldness.I will definitely check out Carolyn Parkhurst in the future. As to recommend this book??? I guess I would wait for the paperback."
1,Very disappointing,"I was incredibly disappointed with this book. The description implies some sort of mystery - trying to solve his wife's death with the help of his dog. But it is not that. The story is not a mystery - it's an unveiling of a disturbed personality, well, two disturbed personalities - the dead wife and the husband (narrator). I do not recommend this book."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE....,"I HAD ""HEARD"" A LOT OF GOOD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOOK SO I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO READ IT. ALL I CAN SAY AFTER COMPLETING IT IS.....I WAS UNDER-WHELMED!!THE ENTIRE STORY LINE IS JUST SO UNBELIEVABLE AND THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SO WEAK I JUST BECAME BORED READING IT. BY THE END OF THE STORY I FOUND MYSELF REALLY DISLIKING LEXY. AS SHE PROVED TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A VERY SELFISH INDIVIDUAL IN GREAT NEED OF PSYCHIATRIC HELP.....AND THE IDEA THAT SHE TAKES HER LIFE BY FALLING OUT OF THEIR TREE......COME ON, IT'S JUST PLAIN SILLY!MY SAVING GRACE WAS THAT I CHECKED THE BOOK OUT FROM MY LOCAL LIBRARY INSTEAD OF PURCHASING IT. THANKFULLY, IT WAS ONLY A WASTE OF TIME AND NOT MONEY!"
2,Not for dog lovers,It lured me in with beautiful writing and delightful images of a quirky woman's life. Then I had to stop reading because it was too disgusting what happened to the dogs. Why did she have to ruin it with a gross-out idea?
2,Forrest Gump Lovers Might Like This Book,"I thought Forrest Gump was a stupid movie. The main character in this book (the narrative voice in the book) is very Forrest Gump-like. Ok, perhaps 20-30 more IQ points, but similarly boring, naive, gullible, and hapless.His wife's character is revealed as somewhat complex and thus somewhat interesting, but not until after her death, and unfortunately the life-flashback portion of the book takes up half the text. While she is alive she is simply whimsical and quirky, and so, together with Forrest, their 150-or-so pages of courtship and marriage is banal, saccharine, and commonplace.The last 60 pages or so help to salvage what was at best a plodding love story."
1,You could find my copy in the trash also,"When i read all the reviews I thought the premise of the book would be interesting. All I really got from this book was sick. How is this book anymore about grief then any other. It was about a guy who fell in love with a whacko and then had there dogs vocals cut out because he really knew his wife was suicidal all along. if you read these reviews please take notice of the ones that are warning you. Unless you like severe animal abuse and total suicidal depression. Don't waste your time. My trash hasn't been collected yet you can retrieve it from there,,,,"
2,She didn't fall from the tree---I pushed her.,"If this woman were my wife, I'd say, ""no---you live...kill ME!"" Quirky is one thing, but this woman was a nutjob. The tale of a man who is so consumed with grief by her loss that he embarks on a journey to get her dog to speak the story of her death is artificially sweet at best because she is the kind of person most people avoid because she is unstable. This makes Paul unlikable because what kind of person attaches himself to a woman who is this much of a timebomb? A fine example of a book that made a strong start and just got lost in a labrynth of ludicrous twists and turns that led to a predictable and safe ending. What was supposed to be thrilling and suspensful was just plain absurd. Moreover, Paul talks and thinks like a woman. Disappointing. Very disappointing."
2,"Great idea, disappointing execution","The idea of communication with animals is one that resonated with this reader. Unfortunately, as some others have attested, the character of the dog in this novel is much more sympathetic than those of the humans. Lexy, the narrator's wife, was a whiny, irrational and frustratingly self-involved character who I found it difficult to care about. The focus of the novel is on how the narrator deals with his grief over the loss of his wife, so this was a major problem.Also, there were some really nice metaphors and good, original descriptions, but the leap into ""noir"" halfway through the book felt forced."
3,"Cliched, but a good read","My main critique of this book was Lexy's character - one of those cliched characters who Live On The Edge and Teach You How to Live. Her relationship with Paul was totally contrived - it didn't feel authentic. Frankly, she just seemed like a loon. Ironically, he describes how ""easy"" it was to be with her, yet it sounds like she made everything incredibly difficult. This is a decent beach read, but it's not outstanding."
2,Disappointing,"I read about the premise of this book and couldn't wait to read it. It dragged for me. It would have been so much better as a murder mystery where that is actually solved by something that results from Paul's effort with Lorelei. The character of the husband was sympathetic but the wife came off as a fruitcake. The writing itself is nice, just the plot needed some more twists and turns. You could see the kidnapping coming the minute the kidnapper excuses himself, it was so predictable."
2,Disappointing,"I usually hate books that are self-consciously quirky, and so I approached this book with some trepidation. The first few chapters took my breath away, however, and I rushed headlong into it, believing that Parkhurst was a major new talent, and that the quirky elements of the story really served a purpose. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its dazzling beginning. Just when the depth and complexity of the characters should have been revealed and explored, Parkhurst instead gives us inane plot developments and girlish whimsy. What a disappointment. The ""girly"" voice really became irritating as the book wore on -- by the end, the narrator felt more like a fourteen year old girl than the middle-aged man he was supposed to be."
3,Dog Lovers Delight,"This book is what I call a ""quick"" read. However, I just couldn't get into the plot which involves a grieving widow trying to teach his dog to talk! The relationship between the dog and the owner is very sweet, but I found myself not really caring about what happenes in the story - with the dog or the sad main character. Maybe if you have a dog that is your pride and joy, you will enjoy this first novel of Parkhurst's, but for me it was on the silly side."
4,"Easy Read, and you'll cry too...","I flew through this book in a little over an hour, which means I was comfortable and interested enough to not put it down, yet it also means it doesnt inspire any deep thinking. Parkhurst's writing seems effortless, and her characters endear themselves to the reader. And for those animal lovers out there, you will shed a few tears in the process."
2,Confused effort,"The Dogs of Babel offers readers an interesting premise--training a dog to master human language--and some potentially interesting characters; however Carolyn Parkhurst is not up to the task. The novel suffers from pedestrian prose, uneven characterization, and (in ironic harmony with the deceased wife, Lexy) an identity crisis. The writer can't seem to decide what the story should be, a mystery-romance or a Garpian satire. There are a few moments of wonderful lucidity in which the prose shines and the story compels, but such moments stand in stark contrast to the mostly limp prose of the narrator and the split-personality of the plot. Perhaps Parkhurst should write short stories exclusively."
2,Strange story,I'll cut to the chase. This book quickly reminded me why I don't read fiction anymore. I tried one more time. Now I remember.
2,A cruel book!!!!,This is a well written book which explores the mind of a tormented man who has just lost his wife .BR> I really enjoyed this book until about half way through when animal cruelty invaded it. It was disturbing and shocking to read about cruel experimentation on dogs.The story had its merits and there was no need for the author to destroy it with animal cruelty. WHY WOULD SHE GO THERE???This book is not for people who love dogs or for that matter anyone who has a heart.
5,Excellent,"Very thought provoking, interesting topic. Some parts were a bit grotesque, but there's a bit of mystery and romance woven in."
2,ruff,"Started great. Husband calls home one afternoon, a cop answers phone - wife is dead she fell out of a tall tree in the backyard only witness is the dog. Whoa! Was it an accident? Was it suicide? What happened? Great! I was hooked. Then it went slowly downhill for this reader with all the flashbacks of their relationship, and fizzled out in the end without even a whimper. 2 stars because I did manage to finish it. Just disappointing for this reader."
3,Thought Provoking,"This is a truly interesting book. Great concept, intriguing plot line, good job of visual imagery. I was okay with the way everything turned out, and I enjoyed that the author revealed things slowly. Here's my major beef with this book: Paul Iverson seemed a little too at ease with the knowledge that that group of crazy dog manglers had his home address. And what kind of an idiot, after seeing those surgical diagrams, still takes his dog (his ""beloved"" dog at that) with him to the meeting. What'd he think? They were all gonna play a game of frisbee with the pooch? And then he's all shocked cause the dog's missing when he gets home. Oh yeah, never saw that one coming... I'm done ranting now. SO, I liked the book, but I was really pissed off at Paul towards the end."
3,If only we could talk with our dogs . . .,"Although there were parts of the story that were contrived, I think that the idea and the writing were very good. Ms. Parkhurst understands and conveys in a tender way both the human grieving process and the comfort that our animals give to us. She also does a pretty good job of showing the highs and lows of one who suffers from depression (manic depression, perhaps) and the frustration and helplessness the person's family feels as a result."
4,Better than what i expected,"I have read some pretty bad reviews about this book.So when i picked it up at the library i was sceptical.I jumped in not expecting much,and came out suprised.True the whole dog speaking blah was out there,but it made the book unique.My only complain was it ended to fast.I felt let down by the sudden ending of the book.It was like the author just got tired of writing."
2,It could have been so much more,"Entertaining? Yes. Fulfilling? No.While I read it in one sitting, I felt denied and hungry at the conclusion. There were intriguing and thought-provoking phrases attributed to both Paul and Lexy. It was a wonderful trip through their romance. But I found myself longing for more substance, less fluff. I expected more on the ""teach Lorelei to speak"" angle, but that, too, proved empty.Don't waste your time, speedread this book, if you read it at all."
2,High And Dry,"This is a book that did not deliver. Like a sincere but inept lover, it will leave you high and dry. The plot was too vague and too timid. It is if the writer wasn't sure what to do with the story after the premise was established - turn it into a murder mystery or a soul-searching odyssey. In the end neither was served up adequately to the reader. Nevertheless, the book is not without charms. The description of the dog is sweet, funny and very realistic. Dog lovers and pet owners will be tickled."
5,Fascinating!,"I'm not really sure what to say about this book....interesting, intriguing, disturbing, sad, poignant, imaginative. After reading a passage toward the end of the book, I copied the two or three paragraphs and emailed it someone I know, the writing was so beautiful and the sentiment so true...(now I need to send them a copy of the whole book)!Anyway, this may not be for everyone, you really have to let your imagination run free, but I think it is a wonderful book."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"A man's wife has died; precisely how she died is a mystery, and their dog is the only witness. The husband is so desperate for the dog to tell him what happened, he embarks on a journey to teach the dog to speak. This is a unique story, to be sure. But not only is the premise preposterous, the ending is a true disappointment. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say I find it seriously annoying when I spend hours and hours reading a book, and only at the end discover the resolution of the mystery required a tidbit of information the author held back merely to encourage you to read the book. I'll compare how I felt at the end of this book to the following example: when I read a murder mystery and I'm introduced to several suspects, but at the end of the book I find out the murderer was someone never introduced in the story before then - a surprise character added at the end. That's how I felt at the end of ""Dogs of Babel"" - manipulated and irritated."
2,"Oh, please","Maximum concept and maximum buzz leads to big sales but mediocre novel. While the premise of getting a dog witness to testify is intriguing, the preciousness of the characters perplexing personalities and the terminal cuteness of Lexy make this a really annoying read. What were the reviewers thinking???"
1,"Horrible, disgusting trash.","A horrible, disgusting book that includes torturing dogs. I threw my copy in the trash after I got to the descriptions of basement surgery on dogs. Too bad trees were destroyed for this garbage."
1,The worst book I have ever read,"Having a Minor in Lit, I have read lots of books. Having purchased many, many books, I have never felt the desire to write a scathing review of a book. I HATED this book.If you HATE animals or get some weird enjoyment over the gross abuse of animals this is the book for you. Once that part of the book began to develop, I really could care less about why this woman killed herself. I could go on and on but this book is not worth the effort."
3,If you love animals,"do not read this book. Up and until the animal torture this was a very interesting story. After that chapter in the book, I could not finish. I didn't even pass this book on, I just threw the book away."
2,Buy a better book.,"I don't understand the glowing reviews for this book. The characters are contrived (Lexi, mysterious woman marries Paul,divorced professor) and uninteresting. Lexi somehow convinces Paul to drive 2 days to Disney for their first date (first hint that this book wasn't going to be believable). We never learn much about the backgrounds or motivations of either character. I wanted the author to flesh out these people -- what brought Lexi to her depresssions? What were her outbursts about? We never really understand Lexi because it is written from the male perspective. Then there is the subplot of an underground talking dog society which grossly abuses dogs --- not worth the paper it took to print. And who would believe that Paul would leave his beloved dog in the backyard after meeting up with these creeps? It was a quick read, but still a waste of my time."
3,Beautiful writing can't override discomfort with abused dogs,"This is an odd little book. Its selection by Anna Quindlen for the Today Show book club was enough to get me to read it, but this was no LOVELY BONES. Linguistics Professor Paul Iverson is devastated when his wife, Lexy, is found dead in their yard, apparently from a fall from their apple tree. The police rule it an accident but he can't help but wonder what really happened. The more he digs, the more he finds odd about the days leading up to her death. The only witness was their dog, Lorelei, a Rhodesian Ridgeback, and Paul gets obsessed with the idea of teaching her to talk so that she may tell him the truth of what happened to Lexy - was it an accident or suicide? I wasn't initially aware of, but was very put off by, the abuse of animals in this book, so I feel compelled to mention it here, but despite that, parts of the book were really beautifully written."
2,Animal Lovers Beware,"This book pulled unexpected emotions from me including full blown rage towards one of the main characters. His blindness in the face of trying to uncover the secret of his wife's death includes an act of such insensitive stupidity I wanted to jump into the pages and rescue the long-suffering Lorelei. I understand the point of exposing the animal abusers as a plot device but I think the author went overboard with the sacrifice Lorelei is required to make. It could have been made with less obvious drama and brutality.My sympathies for Paul's grief remained acute until this pivotal act. From there, it dissipated to the point of disgust.Enter this book at your own risk."
2,An Unpleasant Experience!,"What are publishers thinking? ARE publishers thinking?Paul, the main character, has no character. He loves his wife... that's who he is. She is troubled and clearly needs therapy.The writing is somewhat tedious (do I need a paragraph to tell me they say hello to each other when he comes home?) and the book is quite sentimental, except for the dog abuse, which is horrific. I wish I could wash the book out of my mind.I have given it two stars because she defined his first wife's self-obsessed ways beautifully, having her say something like: ""I have repeatedly asked you not to leave your dirty coffee cup on the table and you have ignored my needs and wishes.""Possibly the writer will grow now that she is a published author (obviously most people here disagree with me).Hug your dog."
2,Emotionally Honest? If You're a Zombie,"This book is, quite frankly, overhyped. It's a fast, light read, yes, but the narrator is cardboard, and I don't buy that his disconnectedness is due to grief. Paul doesn't know his wife at all, and while that is part of the point, the book relies more on plot surprises than the deep character revelation that makes a book literary. Check it out of the library, but don't shell out the cash for hardback."
5,Transported,I so enjoyed this read. I could not put it down until I'd learned the secret of what happened. Lorelei the dog is a wonderful character and I lived that she acted always as a dog would. It was a sorrowful and thought-provoking book.
3,Well written but incredibly sad,I read this after Lost and Found (her second novel). I loved the second novel and found it to be light and fun with an undertone of serious. This book just rocked me into incredible sadness. I am dealing with the terminal illness of the love of my life and I'm an animal person so I was very vulnerable while reading this.Very very well written but sad beyond what is reasonable for me at this time (or maybe any other time).
4,Good in between book..,I read this book in a day. I have a stack of books that I want/need to read but happened to pick up this book and couldn't put it down until I was done. It is not very believable and the characters do/say things that are not believable but it's not all bad. Need something to read on a long plane ride? A beach weekend? Pick up this book.
3,Bring it to the beach and people will think you're smarter than they are,"Parkhurst's inaugural attempt is a worthwhile read. While it suffers from some clunky moments (the idea of suicide as a moment and the awful attempt to market it as The Lovely Bones with dogs) it has enough beauty and power underneath the mistakes to recommend it as an entertaining, lightweight beach read."
3,Sad and not quite satisfiying...,"First of all, this book is EXTREMELY sad! I found it somewhat interesting and quite engaging, and would have given it 4 stars, but I wasn't wowed by the ending. I just didn't enjoy the ending. I thought it a little too easy of a wrapped up ending. However I would still recommend it, just note, it is very sad."
2,The male narration sinks this novel,"Ultimately, this clever idea fails to go beyond just an idea; and the great pace and writing of the first 30 pages dissipates. Others have commented on the play of the arrangement of books on the shelves at the narrator's home, and I agree that it comes across as forced. The caper with the underground dog people is a silly and belongs in a different novel. But what really brings this novel down is the ""male"" narration which is never male enough to deal with the female lead, Lexi. Paul admires her in the way that a woman wants a man to admire her, and not the way a man would. Save your money and buy the used copies. There will be enough of them."
2,Barking up the wrong tree,"Intriguing premise, some good prose and imagination, nicely paced, but ultimately a disappointment. Once you get to the parts with an underground cult in suburbia (who just happened to live in the same neighborhood as the protagonist) doing mutilation surgeries on dogs to try to get them to speak English, a television psychic who takes copious notes of all her conversations for the book she's writing (who'd read that one?), and a PhD in Linguistics who is about as bright as a blown light bulb. Similar in tragic tone to ""The Lovely Bones,"" but without all the humor. My advice: speed-read through all the Dogs Hooked on Phonics stuff, and you'll finish in half the time and may be moved a bit by dysfunctional people meeting in mid-life and trying to overcome their psychological issues."
2,Just gross,"I somehow always end up reading books that leave me disturbed - and, while many people will disagree with me, that is not an emotion I particularly enjoy. ( I probably should read these reviews before I pick up the books!) Anyway, this book was no exception. While the premise sounds kind of interesting and mysterious, it really is a warped book. Unless you enjoy getting new, repulsive ideas (say, perhaps, you can't get enough from the newspaper)I'd suggest that you skip it."
2,derivative and not well characterized,"I felt like I was reading a sophomoric version of An Accidental Tourist by Anne Tyler. Unfortunately, this book utterly lacked the depth and originality of Accidental Tourist. The protagonist is supposed to be a professor of linguistics who has written multiple textbooks. Nothing in his voice or his understanding of language would suggest that he has even broken open one linguistics text, let alone authored one. The inaccuracies about language acquisition were appalling, the premise was silly, and the characters were not credible. A boring book, only to be read if you have nothing else to do."
3,plane geometry,the book you sent me seems to have the basic information found in high school geometry 1 & 2. I hope this book meets the minimum basics.
4,Bathroom Playset - DE Magical Castle,"The fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child. She had a great time using her ""magic wands"" to see what would happen. With the bathroom playset, having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool (I assume so Dora could step up to the sink & brush her teeth) pops out was a very fun surprise. My 7 year old has already spent MANY hours making up princess stories with the castle. The whole set was a great buy."
3,Fun for what it is,this furniture set is better than a lot of the other ones for the dora castle because it's easy to sit the characters in the tub but it's not alwasy obvious to little kids how to work the magic wand feature
2,Hank the Talking Head; not much more,"I'm mostly disappointed with this video. A good 80% of the video time is simply a close-up of Hank Reinhardt's face, as he talks to a point a few feet to the side of the camera. Another 10% is made up of pans across still images from historical drawings. The remaining video time is actual live action. What Hank is saying is usually interesting... but considering how little sword use they actually shot, I'm left wondering: Why didn't he just write a book with this material?"
3,Would've been better as a book,"I bought another of Mr. Reinhardt's tapes ""Viking Sword"" years ago and thought it was pretty informative, well done too. I saw this one and decided to get it too, not as good a choice I found.Much of the tape consists of Mr. Reinhardt sitting in a room somewhere talking about the history of swords, a lot of talking. The man has a lot to say but the camera work seemed amateurish to me, it has the man facing off to the left of the screen. The sound (could have been my hearing in part)wasn't the best- there is no closed captioning.You get some demonstrations of various swords and techniques of use, several still shots too. The story itself is divided into several chapters, each starts off with some information presented in old English style script (read fast, you won't have much time).I think it would've made a pretty good book, I was certainly disappointed with the program in video form."
2,Poor Presentation,"The Jungle Book is a wonderful movie, in beautiful technicolor, that deserves a much better presentation than this DVD.The movie is so bright that one can barely see that it is in color and barely tell what is happening in the movie. I was able to make it watchable by drastically changing the brightness and color controls on my TV, and then it had nowhere near the color and clarity that I had seen when the movie played recently on TCM.If you are not comfortable changing these controls, don't buy this version of the movie.This movie deserves a much better treatment."
1,IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE NOKIA ADAPTERS,"I order this item and when it arrived I complaint with Amazon because it doesnt come with the Nokia adapters. They said sorry sorry sorry, I reorder and again it doesnt come with the adapters so I think that this product has a bad description. In the Coby web page this product is listed as CVM153 not CVM155 so this is an Amazon scam."
2,Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences,"There should be a table of contents of this book on theweb. If I had known it, I would not have ordered this book.The title and the contents of this book are really mismatching. I thought the book was about more practical applications of quantitative research methods to the social sciences. In reality, however, the book is about elementary-level statistics assisted by a simple computer software, accompanied by an introduction to social research methodology."
1,"Confusing, even to the experts","We used this textbook in a quantitative research methods course, and it was not fun. The professor, who has a doctorate in statistics and works in stats every day actually told us not to read certain chapters because they were confusing. She provided alternative materials.I am also very expert at using Excel, but I found Black's Excel exercises to be difficult to follow and poorly set up.If you have another alternative, I'd opt for that instead of Black."
1,poorly made,"I purchased the Oster Fast Speed Clipper through Amazon after much research & many reviews.My husband has very short hair & trims it perhaps every three weeks or so. The first time he used the clipper , the 1/4 inch guide snapped in two! Thinking that it was just one of those things & probably a fluke, I purchsed this set. Again, he used the 1/4 inch guide (twice this time) & it snapped in two! Unbelievable.In retrospect, we should have just got an ""off-the shelf"" trimmer at Wal-Mart. The clipper seems like a fine product, but the quides are just plain flimsy!"
5,Guide combs,These fit my Oster product just right. The order came quickly as well. Reading the reviews I knew this would fit my product.
4,What can I say,This was the best bargin I could find for the cutter I have. I really only use one of the guides but it is worth buying the others to get it.
3,CLIPPER BLADE HAIR LENGTH ATTACHMENTS,"THEY WERE THE WRONG SIZE. SELLER WOULD NOT REFUND WITHOUT BUYER PAYING RETURN SHIPPING. AMAZON DID RETURN PURCHASE WITHOUT ME HAVING TO SEND ITEM BACK, BUT THEY ARE OF NO USE TO ME. HOORAY FOR AMAZON! BOO FOR SELLER!"
1,a complete waste of time.,Reads like a poor outline of a b rated movie. All meaningless action with no planning or direction.
5,Kindle Ebook,"I purchased Kindles for my 13 and 14 year old boy. I got them this book, and others, free for them to get acquainted with their Kindles and to check out some new series. The ordering process was simple,it worked well, and both boys enjoyed the books. Can recommend as a good option for young teenage boys."
2,Unsuspecting Mage,I didn't like it. It should have been listed as a young person's story. It was too simplistic and unbelievable.
3,well now that I'm done,"Here is an example of something with potential, however if you gave picasso an anvil he couldnt make you a beautiful sword. In the hands of another author this might have been a good story... Dont get me wrong I really got into it (after second try) and am kinda bummed that the other books arent free... its just like the people at amazon to give you just enough to start a craving,So dont listen to the haters.... this was actually worth a bit tof your time.. ecspesially if your a D&D; fan"
3,Curl up with some ale & goat stew...,"I agree with some of the criticism, but I did enjoy the story. If you read it you find out early on that the author likes ale & stew, and the fights repeat themselves, but I still thought it was fun. It's not going to be a classic, but for fantasy fans it could be worthwhile."
3,ok i guess,"It's an alright book. The author's switching from narrative form to prose and back again seems to happen at random and can be somewhat disconcerting. It seems like he wrote down a role-playing session or three, including the GM's parts. I'm not sure if I'll go in for the rest of the series, even with the cliffhanger ending."
3,"interesting, but needs an editor","The story is imaginative, the main character is sympathetic, and the author should be encouraged to write more, but he needs to find a good copy editor. I'd volunteer because my fingers itch to mark up the pages to make an OK book into a really good book."
3,"Not a bad read, but sure could use editing!","I rather enjoy this sort of mindless adventure that takes me away from Real Life for awhile. I liked the characters and although yes, it is more or less a Dungeons and Dragons adventure, I'm an old D&D;'er from decades ago so I had fun with it. BUT - the switching from present tense to past tense, often in the same paragraph, serves no purpose. It's as if it were originally written in past tense, then edited into present tense with many errors and omissions. And I find the poor use of ""its"" and ""it's"" and other such grammatical and spelling errors take away from my enjoyment. But then, I find these errors in just about everything published these days, so obviously nobody else really cares, so I just grin and bear it.All in all, a fun read, an hour or two of escape from reality, easily forgettable. And for the price (free!) I won't complain."
3,Tales from a DM wannabe ?,"Let me start with a summary.This is a good story that feels like it is poorly written.However, I do not believe the story to actually be poorly written. I think it was intentionally styled as if a 14 year old Dungeon and Dragons aficionado had penned it. But if you can look past the (for me) annoying strict adherence to present tense, and the occasionally simplistic handling of certain details, you will discover a pretty good little story within.Who knows, you may even find yourself hooked and needing to read the rest of the series."
3,"Enjoyable, but in serious need of an editor","I enjoyed this series. If you've ever though, ""wouldn't it be cool if I got yanked to an alternate world where I was a wizard?"" .. then you will too.The writing is decent, but the entire series needs some major editing. The biggest repeated issue is the author's blatant misuse of homonyms. He'll use heal when he means heel, knew/new, I'd make a list, but there are dozens of examples and I just don't care. He also, in various places misuses plurality. He also, from time to time, forgets which god is which.Spell-check is not an editor.Spell-check Is Not An Editor.If the author paid anyone to edit this series, he needs to get his money back. If he didn't pay anyone to edit this series, then his publisher needs to be slapped.But, if you can ignore the blatant and repeated mangling of the English language, it's an enjoyable series. I'd give it four stars if it had been passed through the hands of a decent editor."
2,Poor execution of scenes,"While the premise of the book is of interest, the scenes in the book are very linear. The sub-plots resolve very simply, without any buildup of tension. If you think about, say, the LOTR trilogy, every scene is imbued with its own level of complexity and anticipation. That this book is meant for younger readers is not a worthy defense - the Percy Jackson/ Olympians series is sophisticated enough to attract older audiences as well. Usage of the present tense also makes reading challenging, without delivering any side benefit."
1,Complete waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of time. I was apprehensive about reading it, after reading the review, but I decided to give the book a chance anyway. It turned out the other reviewers were right. This book has action just of action's sake, no plot or character development. Most incidents are without rhyme or reason, and just there to make it an 'action book'. If you like reading asinine books, filled with mindless fights, this is for you, but for other readers with a more discriminating taste, try better authors like GRRM, Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, LeGuin etc."
2,Spell-check no substitute for editing,"I have been reading the Morcyth Saga books along with my 13-year-old son. We both are enjoying the story line. However, the text is riddled with errors that appear to be the result of relying on spell-check instead of actual proofreading or editing. This does not serve to help teenagers struggling with spelling to get a better grasp of what is correct. Further, some of the words are misused (again, a spell-check artifact). For example, ""empirical soldiers"" is used, when ""imperial soldiers"" should have been. Look up both adjectives, and you may burst out laughing. The list goes on, but you get the idea."
2,Errm,"If this was written by a High School Senior that took notes while playing a linear RPG (Say, Heroes of Might and Magic) and then put his notes into a book, this is what you would have. I can almost imagine the ""pick how you would respond/reply to this situation"" on screen. Do you A) go get help to get the cat from the roof (it's in there, yes, page 190), B) Help the kids throw rocks at the cat, or C) Scold the kids for being immoral and attempt to rescue the cat yourself. If you chose C, then this book is for you."
3,Good storyline,"Enjoyed the ideas expressed in the story. Thought the presentation of the plot line was clever.Needs a lot of editing, that distracted from the story. Also didn't like the main character; found him to be very pretentious. Characters could use more development."
2,"Great story, better writing needed.","I really enjoyed the story in the Unsuspecting Mage - but dear me, the writing was, well, terrible. I wondered at one point if it had been written by a teenager. Sentences switched tenses mid-stream, which made me wild. Which sucked, because it was a good story. I'll try the next book with the hope that the writer matured."
2,A Printed Video Game,"This book is like a video game. It has a simple, one dimensional world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. The main character (I wont call him a hero as others have), James, is a seventeen year old boy from our modern world who suddenly finds himself in this strange land to which he adapts instantly. He never gets homesick, almost never shows any emotions, even when killing people by the dozens.James has magical powers in this world which he uses like a video game player: to kill, maim, destroy, blow up and set fire to things. He goes out of his way to constantly put himself in dangerous situations so he can have the fun of killing a bunch of people. And then the book just stops. I wont say ends, because in a novel that implies resolution of the major conflicts in the story. There is no resolution of anything, we are left hanging like a TV show that ends with ""To Be Continued""."
4,light [slight-spoiler],"I found the book to be a very light read, but that doesn't make it bad. The story was just a refreshing adventure/fantasy plot, with little to no twists. Some characters one has to wonder about, until the author cleverly puts them in later. But I do like the fact that by bringing in an 'out of touch' teen from our time, to another, allows the story to have some more sensibility then most stories would have, ex; he makes spells to clean his water, he's worried about sanitation ect.over all an enjoyable book, and one would not regret reading it."
2,Hard to read in present tense,"This book read like a grocery list. Go to store, pick up rock. Throw rock at bad guys. There was nothing memorable about this book. I'd give the writer credit for completing a novel, except it doesn't feel like anything was accomplished by this book. Usually when a book is a series,when it one book ends something get resolved. This booked ended with no questions being answered, no idea where the next book is heading. While not all series books do stand on their own at least they feel like a complete novel, not a half finished book.I would be curious as to where the author is from, because the spells in the book are supposed to rhyme and they do not to my ears. One line has steel trying to rhyme with kill."
2,Not worth it,Suffice to say I didn't like 'The Unsuspecting Mage' very much and promptly returned it. Out of the many books I've read lately I rate this the lowest. Not much of a story really and no characters I cared about.
1,Junk,"Poorly written with elements cribbed from other better stories. Rife with inconsistencies and a generic plot, it did gain better pacing as you get deeper in."
1,I Felt Cheated,"Had I actually paid for this, I would have definitely felt cheated. As others have already said, this reads like a transcription of a game -- the reader can only follow along and not actually participate. Mostly, though, I thought it was more a travelogue than a story about a mage.The passive present tense was jarring, until I figured out that this was a game -- and even then, I did not care for that style. The whole thing cries out for proofreading and editing.I have the impression that any follow-on episodes will be more of the same. There is probably one good book's worth of story in all the episodes, but the first part was so non-engaging that I'll not be joining in on the rest of it."
2,It's ok,"The story itself seems like it could be interesting if only all the characters were defined more. It's like reading a book where everyone is played by Kevin Costner. The main character, who is 17, speaks like a noble as does his 14 year old street urchin sidekick. I mean if you always thought fresh prince of bel air would have been good had the cast of 90210 been in it instead then you shouldn't have any trouble getting into the characters. I want to know how the story ends but I'm not going to pay for the sequel / shrug"
4,Good Potential With A Lot of Heart,"When I first decided to read this book, it was based on the author's voice, because he said that he was skipping over chapters in a particularly popular book. I can only think that he was talking about Harry Potter. I too, wished for Potter to be a bit more dark than it was, so the idea that an older version (Older meaning High School Senior) book was on the rise was very interesting to me. It was definitely not anything like Harry Potter, but the book was simple, and an easy read and I did enjoy it. I give it 4 starts instead of 3, because I think it was a good attempt and I appreciate when someone tries to execute something with their own passion through their heart. I think if anything, that shines through."
1,None,"This book should never have been published. There's a reason it's free! It sounds like something a 10 year old illiterate kid wrote, with unrealistic characters, and a horrid plot."
1,The Unsuspecting Reader,"*YAWN* Do yourself a favor and delete it before you even download it. It's that bad.It is nothing more than the transcript of a computer RPG play-through. There is no plot. There is no story. There is, however, lots of boring repetitive traipsing through the realm in search of . . . what? Who knows.The story *might* have been improved if it came with an MP3 of the sounds of D&D; dice being rolled--just for background ambiance."
1,Just not enjoying it,"I find the premise of the story to be an interesting one, but am not enjoying the quality of the writing. It reads more like an outline than a fully fleshed novel. Or perhaps fan fiction written by a middle schooler. The characters are not well developed, and the story is rather unimaginative and repetitive."
1,"Good Lord, how dull.","In a world full of wonderful books, I will not waste my time with this one. It's as if you're at a wonderful desert table with a chocolate fountain and unbelievable cakes and candies, and you choose to eat a stale wafer cookie.It's narrated as if you're watching a old educational video, dialogue that was totally out of style 50 years ago. What is with the weird use of present tense? And the weird absence of use of contractions? What teenage boy says ""I did not know him well, but he was well liked by everyone.""? The whole thing has the effect of distancing the reader from the characters altogether. It's as if all the characters are on very heavy doses of anti psychotic drugs, totally flat affect and super super superficial. I cannot stress enough what rubbish this book is. That there are apparently 5 books in this series already completely boggles the mind. Who buys this rubbish? What moron in the publishing house sent this through?"
3,Dungeons and Dragons Script,"I've read some of the other reviews on here...everyone seems to hate or love the book...I'm guessing that all of the ""loved its"" are coming from the author, his friends, or 12 year old kids.It is really a D&D; script. There is waaaayyy too much attention given to how much he spent on this and that...There really isn't much of a plot throughout the first 95% of the book. Something just starts to emerge at the end.That said...I did enjoy the book. Call me a 12 year old kid....but I liked it. I didn't love it, but at least it kept me reading (most of the other free books on Kindle don't even get that much from me). The little bit of plot at the end was actually enough for me to check if there was a second FREE book to keep reading.In the end...it is probably a 2/5 stars...but the price is right at FREE so I gave it three."
2,hrmm.,"This is the first book I'm actually reading on my new Kindle. I am having huge issues dealing with the physical grammar of this book. Throughout the first half of this book (I'm exactly half way through now) the author cannot quite figure out which tense he wants to write in .. which is grossly distracting. It also has a number of spots of incorrect word use (which actually renders one sentence literal gibberish .. it just doesn't parse) that I can't quite attribute to publishing typos.Mostly I'm finding the writing is getting in the way of the story/plot .. or lack thereof. Like the other non-five-star reviewers here, I find the yarn basically lacking from the typical literary fantasy fiction standard I'm quite accustomed to reading. Its merely tolerable because it was free; I'd be seriously put out if I'd purchased it."
3,"Simple, but good read","I've been reading fantasy books since I was little. I did like this book. I guess you could say I agree a little with all the previous reviews, hence the 3 star rating. I got this book for free (can't beat that!) and it was a very quick read. It does remind me of an RPG game. Towards the end, all the fights just seem kind of repetitive. I do think the story has potential, though. I'm intrigued enough to buy the second book in the series."
4,Great find!!!!,This book is terrific. i just couldnt put it down. i highly recommend you read this book. you wont be dissappointed
4,The Unsuspecting Mage,"Good read, interesting writting style, the writting perspective almost felt like a DnD game. This book, will not change your life, but it is entertaining."
1,If you have not reached puberty yet this might appeal to you.,"Maybe I'm just to old but this book just seemed to be rambling on and on never going anywhere. I think the only female interaction was a princess smiled across the room. But D&D never was one of my favorites. I think the comments about the food in every pub they stopped at was about the only sensual appeal to the whole book. As far as the ""Mage"" his magical abilities were limited by his lack of insight as he stumbled from one thing to the other. If you have time you want to totally waste then this book is a must read."
2,Some easy things that could have been fixed,"This is yet another two star review. I am reading the first two installments because I am a gourmand reader, not a gourmet reader. I will not address critiques I have read that characterize the story as one dimensional D&D adventure. I will simply state that the writing is so bad that it interferes with the story. Misused language. Story goes back and forth between third person present tense (which grates on me anyway) and third person past tense, sometimes in the same sentence. Mr. Pratt, you don't ""make due,"" you ""make do."" Please find an editor. I can't believe this was ever edited at all. It wouldn't take that much work to fix these simple issues."
1,Get an editor,"Imagine a 15-year-old nerd recording his role playing game and then publishing it without any rewriting, editing, or even a literate adult's proof reading. That, in Pratt's terms, is what you have to ""make due [sic] with"" in this book. I found the lack of editing so frustrating it was hard to pay attention to the mediocre story."
2,Sigh,"So I am all of maybe 10 pages into this book and I just can't force myself to read it. It is written like a trashy romance novel. The dialog is very poor, and the narrative bland and stilted. I believe I written essays in middle school with more pep than this."
2,Good concept poor execution,"I liked the concept of the book however, the author lacks the skill to keep the readers attention for either the storyline. Read only if you are desperate for fantasy style adventure."
1,"Weak, present tense rubbish","I tried to read and like this. The basic idea sounded good, a teenager fumbles his way to becoming a wizard in an alternate world, BUT the thing is written in the present tense. Personally, I hate that. You read lines like ""He washes his hands"" or ""As he walks along, he stubs his toe and he falls."" It's like reading a narration, and it's unpleasant in the extreme. I found the dialog to be weak, I thought the characters were a little flat and all in all, I thought it read like something from an inexperienced 7th grader might have written for a school project."
1,Self Published,"All of the one star reviews have covered all the relevant points in regards to a reading of the book. I should have read these reviews before wasting time downloading. Like others, I am happy I didn't spend money on it. However, a few reviewers feel the need to congratulate Mr. Pratt on having at least been published. Then they wonder about what the publisher was thinking. Let me clear this up for you. Mr. Pratt is Mr. Pratt's publisher. It says so right on his own website. Apparently, he's his own editor as well, and he knows no more about editing than he does about writing. It is hard enough to find good books these days without free crap like this getting in the way of the search. If it was possible to give this book negative stars, I would do so."
1,Don't bother to download,"I downloaded this book because I thought the storyline sounded fun. I forced myself to read 4 chapters, hoping that it would improve. Other reviewers thought it read like a D&D Campaign. I've never had the opportunity to play D&D so I can't compare it to that. Personally, I thought it was like one of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books without the fun of choosing what happens next. I feel bad for those of you that paid for the book. I downloaded it free for my Kindle and am really glad I didn't pay good money for a bad book."
2,reads like a beginner writer,Very hard to follow. Very choppy written.Rough around the edges. The story has potential given a few more rewrites and thought for a more smoother flow of story.
2,Meh,"Well, I was really looking forward to reading this, it had me written all over it, ""do you love books? Become the hero of your own story"" it was a bookworms dream. Sadly it fell short of the mark, yes it had all the right ideas and by the book but it lacked draw and imagination. I couldn't picture the world I couldnt see myself as any of the characters and it bored me.This could be because the author always used third person view for the main character, it made it impersonal and didn't feel as though you were part of the story.Sadly this is one of the books I never finished, I couldn't, so maybe it does get better but life's not worth reading boring books."
4,fun to read,"I normally do not write reviews on books, but I felt this needed it. I agree the editing was terrible. I enjoyed the plot. Someone said they enjoyed that this did not have multiple plot lines. I thought it unusual that the character acutually accepted what was happening to him. He does not try to change the world but work with it. I am looking forward to buying the remaining books. I can`t wait to find out what happened to all of the minor characters and of course the main one."
3,"Please for the love of all that is holy, get a decent editor. Or maybe a ghost writer.","What killed me was the writing. ""He goes here. And he does this. Then he says something. And when he is done speaking, he moves to there."" Both the tense and the phrasing are TERRIBLE throughout the book.That said, it's an interesting story. I enjoyed the D&D; references things to like a character's encumbrance when deciding how much gold to carry. It's just a hard slog through a badly-written book."
2,Won't be paying for any more of these,"Well, since it was free, at least I don't have to feel cheated ;-) I definitely won't be buying any more in the series. I thought, with so many published books under his belt, that the author must be fairly talented, but his talent must lie elsewhere. I won't repeat most of the things that other reviewers have mentioned aside from the present tense of the book. I found it extremely distracting, and actually started forcing it into the past tense in my head.I agree with the other reviewers that this reads like a walkthrough of an AD&D; session with very little character development, strange/stupid reactions and lack of questioning of various events and situations, no reflection of previous events, and repetitive battle scenes."
2,A Linear Path,"This book was purportedly a novel, but was written as one short story followed by another by another with little suspense and no use of subplot. While entertaining at moments, it never fulfilled the promise of its premise nor, in fact, of being a novel at all."
3,Wordy but entertaining,"Given that this was the first e-book I downloaded (and free!), I had very low expectations. I enjoyed the plot and initially thought the author's detailed descriptions enhanced my enjoyment. However, halfway through the book I mostly skipped the descriptive details (unless it was explaining a fight or magic) and looked for quotation marks; not exactly the emotion you want to have while diving in! I would still recommend reading it if you are into fantasy, although this part of the saga isn't dramatically fantasy-like."
2,A sound D&D script,This one started out with a good premise but the writing style and the linear nature of the plot didn't live up to its promise. It reads just like a gaming script which makes it a bit stilted and occasionally jars. I finished it hoping it would get better as the author got more practice but it didn't - I wouldn't recommend it and won't be going further with the series.
1,Present tense is an amateurish way to write.....,".....and this book reads like it was written for a high school English class. Worst book I've read in a long time.I like lots of books, especially ones written by Robin Hobb, George Martin, and Stephen Donaldson to name but three. These books were well written. This one was not. Just wondering - how many of you are still in high school yourselves?"
5,book review,"A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager who enjoys fantasy and/or sci-fi."
3,Farmers will love,"Those who play D&D will enjoy this fast paced adventure. Now I want to buy ""Fires of Prophecy"", the next book in this series."
2,Why?,"No regrets reading it because it was free but not sure why I bothered.There was nothing to take away from this book. It was just a play-by-play of battles with a few lines of speech thrown in for good measure. The narrator's voice also became very grating very quickly. I disagree with others who say that present tense was the problem because it was more than that. I can't quite point my finger on it. Like a distant, omniscient grandfather figure used to narrating Left 4 Dead matches. I ended up wanting to off myself.I'm giving this two stars, and that's only because it was free."
1,Not so great,"My guess is that these reviews were all written by DeWalt's marketing department. The day after I bought this rotating laser, it stopped working, and I had to argue with the dealer to get it warrantied. In addition, I found it time consuming and not so simple to set up. I won't buy another laser from DeWalt."
4,Bones: Season Three (Totally Decomposed Edition),"The episodes were great but disk four would not operate on any of my DVD or Blueray players. Does anyone know if you can return just one DVD? I had the same issue with the last episode, the season finale on season two's DVD. I am afraid to buy the DVDs anymore thinking that once I get to the last DVD in the set, it will not work."
3,so so,Disc set in fair shape. Three of the five discs skip but not enough to warrant returning. Over i am satisfied and the product was shipped promptly.
4,GREAT SEASON,LOTS OF CHANGES IN THIS SEASON BUT I THINK IS THE BEST FOR THE RELATION OF THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS
4,Good show,"I do not watch tv shows usually, but I liked CSI (Las Vegas). My Fiance got me hooked on Bones, and I find I like it even better than CSI.There is a lot of humor as well as the crime scene stuff, and now CSI seems really dry in comparison."
5,awesome show,"great show, it's got it all, funny, serious, crime fighters, heartfelt relationships, keep it coming!"
1,Wrong Product,"I was very excited about receiving Season Three of Bones in the mail, as I love the show. I even woke up early the day after it arrived so I would have time to watch a few episodes. But what do I find upon opening the case? All of the Season Two DVDs in the box for Season Three. I'm very upset about this and I will be returning the wrong product for a replacement of the RIGHT DVDs."
5,Love Those Bones!,"The Bones series has a great cast, great writers, and exciting plots! The humor in the writing is terrific and the nuanced acting is gifted. I discovered it only a year or so ago in syndication. I don't know how that works but it seems they can't show the episodes in any kind of order. So I have been buying the volumes in order to watch them and watch the stories develop in sequence. This 3rd Season focuses on the Gormogon plot and is great. The extras are fun but there could have been more. I didn't enjoy the commentary as much as I thought I would - just personal preference. It is a great addition to my library."
5,Good series,Got this for my mom and she loves it. She loves this show! It came in perfect condition as well.
5,Sophisticated humor at its best,I am really enjoying seeing some of the earlier episodes that I missed and have not seen since they were aired.Seeley and Temperance make a great couple and the ensemble cast makes the show really great.
1,Bones season 3,"This show does not improve with age, acting is staged and unimginative. Will not be interested in buying any more."
1,Not falling for it,I'm not falling for it. Do you really think rabid fans want to fill up their Tivos with these downloads? Where's the DVD's?

4,"Still a very good show, but..","Don't get me wrong, Bones continues to be a family favorite at our house, but the new plotline about the therapist for Brennan and Boothe just doesn't quite work, and some of the momentum seems to have died with the writers strike this year, now that the show s going again, it doesn't sound like we are going to get a full season out of any show, but at my house we are hoping that our favorites like Bones are exceptions to that.When you have a favorite like Bones, and you want the DVD set, you want a whole season! If that doesn't happen I guess I will download all of these episodes, since they can be stored in the Amazon digital locker, to avoid crowding my Tivo."
5,love it,"consistently good, interesting, and even funny. love the way Emily and David portray their characters. definitely recommend."
5,Love It,I love Bones. I watched Season 3 in about 2 days then I started over watching Season 1 again. I can't get enough of Bones.
5,They did it again!,"The producers and cast of this BONES series struck a home run once again! The cast delivers yet another provocative, enlightening, and fun season of episodes. So glad I decided to purchase this series - look forward to upcoming series as well."
5,Love Bones!,We love the Bones dramas and love not having to listen to commercials. It's worth the cost of paying for the seasons just to watch them undisturbed with commercials. Character development in this series is exceptional.
5,Timely and Excellent :),This is a great series--a favorite of my sister's and mine. I purchased this season as a Christmas present to her and was extremely pleased at the speed in which it arrived. It was in excellent condition and the packaging was neat and carefully done. Very excellent series excellent buying experience. Keep it up!
3,Canada,This item is only $19.98 (as of Dec. 4)from 'amazon.ca' & you will save 20% on the exchange rate.I don't agree with one of the other reviewers who stated that the series was as good as the books. I like the series & I will be buying this item but it is so different from the books that I don't ever know why they bothered keeping the character's name.
2,"Bones, season 3, partly defective discs","I love what I can watch, but part of the series (parts of discs 1 and 3 seem to be edfective - they won't play for me."
1,digital screw up,There a total of 6 disc with up to 4 shows per disc and on at least 6 shows are digitally messed up. Which prevents the viewing of up to 3 episodes and cuts in half 3 other episodes. You get to watch the first half of 3 episodes on 3 different disc's leaving you with no ending. I'm very dissappointed only mess up to every happen to me through amazon.
1,Pissed Off Writers,"Given the attrocious writing that ruined Bones' Season 3 for me, the only thing that makes sense is that we had a bunched of pissed off writers before the strike and the same group of pissed off writers who obviously didn't get what they wanted as a result of the strike. I just wish that they hadn't taken their anger and frustration out in destroying all of the good work they did in Season 1 and 2."
1,Not recommended,"I own this DVD and it really sucks!!! Please, do not buy it!!! There's a lot of wrong stuff!!!I wish I could rate with no stars at all, but it isn't possible..."
4,Great tool,"Excellent tool for learning the techniques and licks of this album, author should do a few other. Highly recommended."
5,a new favorite pianist,"After hearing him play live, I wanted to know more about him. This DVD is excellent, going through how he prepares for a concert and also has one of his own compositions on it, great. He's an amazingly good pianist."
4,"Gnawing, days after you read the last page.",It's been nearly a decade since I read this book but I'll never forget its profound impact on me--even as an only child! Minot's voice is so truly crafted that you will experience this family through each of the characters. You feel as though you are inside the heads of the mother and the siblings. You feel a sense of forboding with the father's presence. It's almost haunting that is exactly what makes this such a memorable read.
1,This book gets great reviews???,"Seven Children in this family- all indistinguishable from one another. I had high hopes after reading ""Evening"" and seeing all the great press for ""Rapture"". But this novel ended up being one of the most disappointing reads I have had all year."
2,Nice picture book...,"Nice picture book of rustic homes built with recycled materials, however if you are looking for actual how to knowledge this isn't the book. I was hoping for more information on the ""how"", but instead the author focused almost exclusively on the final product. Would have been nice to see a ""beginning to end"", with details on how the material was salvaged, prepared, and installed."
5,Great little book for the youngster who is into words and sounds,My son loved this book when it first was out. I bought it again for a young friend. My only warning is the used copy I bought had faded over the years andfor these older eyes it was hard to read! I'm not sure how you can check beforehand if buying it used online but it might be worth questioning the seller.Hopefully it will be re-released!
3,Lacks a certain fire.,"Malone is a fine player, but to me this record lacks the kind of vitality which, almost by definition, inheres in improvisational music. The tempos are too slow, and the band's performance sounds stilted in places - like a band that hasn't played a lot together, and which is therefore more concerned with avoiding ""mistakes"" than just cutting loose. Also, to me, the record sounds a tad over-produced - Malone has a such a nice, warm, ringing tone live, but Lipuma has flattened it, making it sound somewhat benign."
2,be forewarned: sizes are unrealistic!,"I agree with the reviewer who said that anyone who thinks a 32 inch bust is a Large has been in Hollywood too long.I bought this book after flipping through it quickly at the bookstore. I liked the designs. Some are quite cute, for example: the bamboo-handled purse, the heart-shaped pillow, and the fuzzy baby booties.I'm now kicking myself. I should've read some of the patterns more carefully. A skirt that I thought I could make for myself goes up to a size Large - a whopping 33 inches (and remember - that's the size of the FO, not the person wearing it)! GET REAL, SUSS!Don't make the same mistake as I did. Take a pass on this one."
3,"not bad, but not very impressed","I have mixed feelings about this purchase. Some of the designs are very cute and look like they will be fun to complete; however, most of the patterns look identical to ones in knitting books I already own. In other words, not a lot of new material here. The sizing of the patterns is also disappointing. Many of the knitwear designs look like they would be well-suited to larger figures, but the sizing of the patterns does not allow for this."
1,Overly impressed with her fabulous customers--still!,"This book suffers from the same irritating weaknesses as the first book-- self-involvement of the author, the directions are frequently unclear, the sizing unrealistic and the name dropping PATHOLOGICAL. On an anecdotal level, I have been to Suss Cousins's store in L.A. twice and found her to be rude, dismissive and unpleasant--apparently she saves her friendly demeanor for her fabulous celebrity customers. I wonder how THEY feel about her advertising her connection with them in order to increase her own sales..."
2,Problematic,"Overall, This is the wost knitting book I own. That's not to say it's awful, but there are FAR better.The patterns are adorable! A lovely afghan, heart-shaped pillow, and an excellent sweater jacket are highlights (at least for me.)The issue is the patters have problems. A LOT of errors. Check her errata page big time here, and just keep your eyes peeled for things that just don't look right....It's also more of a coffee-table book, with a lot of extra nothing"
5,VERY Impressive,"I'm really surprised at some of the reviews I'm reading. Are these people even fans of the band? I got the album today, and I've listened to it 4 times and I love it. I have everything by the Cure, and I think this is going to be one of my favorites. It has a more ""rock"" sound than anything else they've done, which is cool. I love it when bands stretch themselves. Very similar to Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, and the last three songs they recorded before this album: Just Say Yes, Cut Here, and Signal To Noise. If you like some of their other songs like Just Like Heaven, From The Edge of the Deep Grean Sea, Fascination Street, and Trap, you'll like this album. Dark, rocking, and just plain good."
1,Sad,"The Cure was my favorite band in the 80s. The only thing they made since Wish that's listenable (and that album is mediocre overall) is Bloodflowers. This barely demo quality thing proves the adage ""You can't judge a book by its cover"" wrong, as did Wild Mood Swings.I didn't buy that album because of its cover and its title. When I finally heard it ten years later I found out just how right I was. This one, though, got me, because I was looking for a gift for my sister, a huge Cure fan. I would have been better off buying her a pack of socks.The Cure, though, didn't stop their quest to find the bottom of the bottomless pit with this thing, though. The album after this one is even more preposterous when called a ""Cure"" album. I had suggested that the band get Porl back. I had hoped that would cure them. But, the problem must really be Robert. He has utterly lost it and needs to pack it in."
2,Not Impressed...The Cure Can Do Better!,"I purchased this album yesterday and after giving it a few good spins I have decided to review it. I am not impressed by the latest output from The Cure.I am disappointed in the lyrics, it could be a personal thing but they don't speak to me on this album, especially when Robert Smith decides to use profanity much more than I'm used to from The Cure on such songs as ""Before Three"" and ""Us or Them"".The album does have a few good tracks, but I wouldn't say they warrant purchasing this album. Such tracks would be ""Lost"", ""Anniversary"", ""Alt.end"", Taking Off"", and although it is a little too long, I like ""The Promise"".I was hoping, after the release of ""Greatest Hits"" in 2002 that we would see more songs like ""Cut Here"". I am disappointed."
1,The Distinct Sound of Vomiting,"Arggggg! What a load of manure this disc is! I like The Cure but I can barely handle listening to this disc for more than 2 minutes. Robert Smith's screaming and shouting and there's no melodic songs on here at all. The only thing worse than listening to this disc is looking at the shoddy cover art. Maybe some will find the artwork of children ""cute"" but I think something more substantial could have been chosen for the bloody cover. Avoid unless you enjoy listening to the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard."
4,best album since Wish,"I wasn't too convinced upon first listen, but now I am. I like this album, and contrary to other reviewers, I like the artwork on it. This is a balanced album, it's got has all sorts of typical cure sounds that appeared in previous albums such as Kissme, Head in the door, Pornography, and Wish. It's got those catchy happy songs next to hard hitting angry songs. It's also got a couple of those typically depressing cure songs.This is strangely addictive, no doubt the best thing they've done since Wish. Wild mood swings is non-existant, Bloodflowers had a couple of good songs on it, but this is a true album, to listen all the way through.It's a sin though that Americans aren't getting the album closer, Going nowhere, which makes the album close on a tender note rather than the abrassive The Promise."
3,A review for Cure fans,"This disc contains an EP worth of good songs while the rest are disposable. In my opinion the last good Cure CD was (seriously) Wild Mood Swings. That CD contained good, Cure style pop songs which made us all fall in love with the Cure in the first place. However, somewhere between Wild Mood Swings and Bloodflowers Robert Smith decided to live up to the label of depressing goth band that have dogged the Cure throughout their career. Gone from Bloodflowers are the horns and upbeat tempo which had been a staple of their earlier work. To say that this album is part of the trilogy is sacrilegious in my eyes. This album is quite similar to Bloodflowers save tracks 4 and 7-10. If you liked Bloodflowers, you'll like this album. If you felt it lacked in tempo and lyrical quality like myself, you may be disappointed as this album follows in the same footsteps."
4,"Not the best, but a for sure upswing!","After listening to two horrid albums in a row, it is nice to hear something that is The Cure. There are drops in style back to The Top, Head on the Door, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. Is it the greatest, ""NO"", but it is definately good to hear something which shows that Robert hasn't disappeared. I had my fears, but it made a hell of a birthday present coming out on the 29th!"
4,it's quality music ppl,"It's a good album,,,,why? because it's not for mainstream...all songs are very long melodic songs that throw you inside of them and never let you go till the end...obviously it's all gothic stuff, all love songs but that's what you should expect from the Cure...they definetely did a good job on this album...later"
4,Good but something missing...,"I've loved the Cure since about 1984...I love the haunting melodies and Robert's ballads, like This Twilight Garden, Apart, Catch...this CD is good but I guess I was just hoping for more of these types of songs like A Letter to Elise or Trust..."
2,Straight poop.,"Seriously, I'm a rabid fan of everything they did from Three Imaginary Boys to Disintegration (Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me had way too much uninspired and lame pop filler IMO, though), but The Cure should have stopped with Disintegration. It sounds like a farewell album. It could have been their swan song. But no, they continued to make albums, and poor ones at that. The Cure's dark moody pieces have always been their best, and the pop stuff usually the worst, barring the material on Japanese Whispers.I've tried listening to this album on numerous occasions (I own it unfortunately) and I just can't enjoy it. You'll be much more satisfied with The Cure's earlier work, trust me."
2,save it,"This was the first Cure album I bought and I thought it was trash. Now I'm assuming that the Cure is really a great band and this is just a thin spot in their discography, but this was not a very good album. I had to struggle to listen to it once. The songs didn't go anywhere. I mean angst is one thing, but this wasn't angst, this was just being emotive for wads of cash. And other agree, any album that's being resold (103 for sale used!) starting at $3.00, while its single is still in rotation, clearly is a wad of crap. Maybe you (the reader) and I should choose our Cure introductions a little wiser next time."
2,Still Lost in a Forest,"And the downward spiral continues . . . the songs in this album appear to feature our friend Robert either singing or screaming with some random, gritty, repetitive music playing in the background. Some of the lyrics seem strangely reminiscent of those in past albums -- just set to lamer music. I wonder if the group spent more than 20 minutes drinking down a keg while composing the words and music for this one. But not all is hopeless, I liked ""Anniversary."" It has some of the haunting qualities of The Cure that we know and love so well, which proves that The Cure can put something decent together if they try. The album as a whole is nothing memorable (with the exception of a throbbing headache from some of the songs) -- but if you can spend $6 or less to get it, go for it. Otherwise, save your money for the next anthology featuring the Ultralux mix of ""Friday I'm in Love"", the GottaGetRich mix of ""The Walk"", and the TooDrunktoWriteaGoodSong mix of ""The Forest""."
1,Oh no....,"I have been a die-hard Cure fan for many years and tolerated some not so great albums, but this one is just bad. I couldn't believe it when I heard it, I was just in shock. This is not the Cure I grew up with...The lyrics are okay but the melodies don't flow. It sounds unfinished and quickly put together. A couple good songs on this album, but they are not worth buying this CD. It truly saddens me to hear it. Don't buy it."
1,Please Don't Use Records as Therapy,"I'm a big fan of The Cure. They have made a lot of great records, but I'm sorry to some of the other reviewers, I didn't think this was one of them. It starts out with a hopeless rant about being lost(no real music involved) that is funny the first time, but hardly enjoyable to listen to a second time. The album then at least attempts to be musical. Unfortunately the songs are just drab and mediocre. Mr. Smith seems to have used the process of writing and recording these songs as some kind of self therapy. I really don't care about some horrible breakup with a woman he insists on telling me about in detail.I do like two songs including The End Of The World. I give the album only one star because after several honest tries to appreciate the album I've decided it was a waste of money and I don't care to have it in my collection. It has to be that bad to get only one star from me. I'd advise others not to waste their money on this one."
3,"A solid rocking release from ""The Cure"".","After reading some other reviews, I think some people need to listen to this more than once before they review it. True it's no ""Disintegration"" (there will never be another), and true it's maybe not a classic album, but it is very good. It's also much more rocking than the past few albums, which is a nice change from the mostly lush ""Bloodflowers"". The deluxe edition of this with the DVD is unneccessary to get, the album is the same, but the DVD is boring. Overall it's a great disc, that sounds old and new at the same time. That's a ""Promise""."
2,disappointing,"How can the same band that farted out ""The Top"" years later come back to produce a masterpiece like ""Disintegration?"" It's this kind of inconsistent artistry that keeps Cure fans buying their CD's even after having been burned.This self titled release actually makes me yearn for ""Bloodflowers."" The recording is completely disjointed with only 2-3 songs worthy of standing against The Cure's body of work (Labyrinth and Anniversary.) I can tell why Simon Gallup wanted to punch Ross Robinson's teeth in - you can barely hear his trademark bass.Buy it if you're bored, or just desperate to relive your youth, but if you're familiar with The Cure's catalogue, you'll probably agree this is a fairly vaccuous offering. R. Smith tells us more than once during this CD that he ""can't find himself"" and that he ""doesn't know what's going on."" Thanks Robert, but the recording stated that clearly enough."
1,Cure disintegrating ?,"This record consists of a bunch of jam sessions recorded.I think the Cure is slowly dying away today. I'm waiting for a great, emotional, greatly produced album. I think it's a shame they don't get themselves together to do great things again. Having this platform, having such a legendary band, how can Robert Smith just record some tired and uninspired jam sessions ? I am desillusioned these days. I want some great hymns, psychedelic deepness and proper music.Trying to sound more indie 'rockish' just does not work for them.If they don't give us a beautiful record next, the case is closed for me.However, one song's got some of the old magic:Anniversary."
2,Consistently not what I expected.,"One thing about this album is consistence. I really want to like it more, but there is just to much of Robert Smith yelling. So he has lost himself, so what. I like crunchy sounding guitars with lots of feed back, but I also like to have a more coherent melody. A lot of this album sounds alike. It is loud and mad. More melodies are needed.I hear stuff I like in this album, but I hear too much I don't. Maybe with more spins it will grow on me. I just don't enjoy listening to it, like I do other cure albums."
5,The Cure is back !,"This is one of the best cure albums, it may take a couple of plays before you get into it, it's not as easy or catchy as some other Cure albums but if you like The Cure you will not be dissapointed.The only bad thing are the missing tracks in the american release ... wich are really good ones, i'm sorry to see a lot of bad reviews about it... even on the same day of its release, people should not review a item after the first listening."
3,"The Cure ""The Cure""","""Lost"" (8/10)""Labyrinth"" (7/10)""Before Three"" (8/10)""The End Of The World"" (9/10)""Anniversary"" (8/10)""Us Or Them"" (9/10)""alt.end"" (8/10)""I Don't Know What's Going On"" (7/10)""Taking Off"" (8/10)""Never"" (6/10)""The Promise"" (5/10)The Cure return with their first studio album in a while. I was actually impressed with the result of such a long hiatus. There are some bumps along the road, but many good tunes. Standouts include ""The End Of The World,"" ""Us Or Them,"" and ""Taking Off.""Overall rating: 7.5 out of 10."
2,The Cure has reached the end of the world,"I'm a huge Cure fan, and was highly disappointed. I classify their music into three genres: happy, sad, and angry. Although this album covers it all, I was hoping for the ""trilogy"" to continue. Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers are the three best albums The Cure has made. I hate their happy pop songs such as 'Friday I'm in Love', 'Mint Car', 'Just Like Heaven'...too much fluff and not believable. Robert needs to get back to the basics of The Cure: bleak, somber, desolate, depressing, sad, and angry. The 'Kiss Me' album produced one track, 'The Kiss' with a bunch of B-Sides. The 90's 'Wild Mood Swings' produced one track: 'Want' which contained a bunch of B-Sides. 'The 13th' had a B-side called 'It Used To Be Me' which should have been on the album. That was their worst album to date, but now it's 'The Cure'. Suggested track includes: The Promise."
2,Adding a bad taste 2 what should've been a nice occasion.,"Ok, The Cure made a really good album. Now here is the problem. The f*ckfaces only released 3/4 of it in America. Why does Japan get three extra songs? Why does England get one extra song? And really, why does the crappy vinyl version HAVE FOUR EXTRA SONGS? I know 20 songs were recorded, so use some ""non-album"" material for precious extra cash b-sides. I don't want to buy any more singles. You have made enough money off of me. You want a higher rating? Put up the songs you ripped me off for to download for free on your website (I will download them anyway). Don't try to pull that greedy @ss crap again."
1,Ugggg!,"If you like the albums ""Kiss Me..."", ""Disintegration"", any of the singles, or best of's like ""Galore"", you will not like this album. Someone compared it to ""Bloodflowers"". I liked more on that album than this, and that was one of my least favorite Cure albums, and I have been a fan since the mid 80's.There is a lot of ""yelling"", ""screaming"" of lyrics.There is not one ""toe tapper"" in my opinion.It also says something, that less than a week after the album goes on sale, people are selling it used."
2,I need a cure,"This is the worst cure album to date, and I have been a fan since The Top. Sooooooo disappointing too, because I really wanted to like it. Well, at least we have all the re-released CDs to keep us company a bit longer. Can't wait for the next round to be released."
3,mixed review,"Although he's been around for what seems like ages, Robert Smith must be only in his early 40's, and yet, I think this album shows that this must be the end of The Cure. his former magic shines on lightly on some of these tracks, but most are just a monotonous angry scream. The sound of the band is too muddy, you can't really pick out any guitar riffs or melodies, Mr. Smith has definitely lost his touch. Even so, I like the CUre so much that I don't regret buying it, and won't be selling it soon either, maybe save it for one of those days in which the world makes no sense at all."
2,Smith give me my money back!,"The Cure should have ended their career after Bloodflowers as they said they will. I think it was a great album but this new CD is just horrible. It's annoying, repetitive and boring for most of the time - I just cant believe how could they release such a bad record. I'm the Cure fan but I'm so disappointed and mad at Smith for stealing my $15.00."
2,As dispensable as anything since Disintegration,"It's not that ""The Cure"" is bad. There are some inventive moments (openers Lost and Labyrinth) and satisfying melodies (End of the World, Taking Off); but there is nothing that stirs the soul like their earlier work, and nothing that's nothing like anything you've heard before.Worst of all are the words... how many times can Mr. Smith tell us it's the end before no-one really cares anymore? Sadly the lyrics sound more tired, banal and frankly adolescent with every new release."
1,INCURABLE,"Ok, so I thought I was Robert Smith in high school (back in, oh, 1986-7) and i carried the torch a long, long time but I think I have really just about had it with Mad Bob & Co. This album sounds like gothy oatmeal. Two, three, four listenings back to back and nothing...Robert - please just STOP already! Those out there singing this albums' praises - have you actually listened to the back-catalogue? The Top, Faith, Kiss Me, Pornography, etc etc - there's so much there, and now with the exceptional B-sides collection, this album just pales and fails."
1,Avoid this CD at all costs,"This CD sounds like someone's dead or someone died on the spot. Man, this CD gives me a really bad earache and headache! Avoid this CD and you will be fine. buy someone like Joy Division or Bauhaus to keep you entertained! :P"
2,i know about the art work,"When robert was on the tonight show with jimmy kimmel, he was asked about this strange art and robert had told him that he asked his five year old nephew and nese to draw pictures of good dreams as well as bad dreams!The hole booklet is there art work and no they have no idea about it..im just wondering about when there olderwill they want royalties heh heh.The album is a big dissapointment to me..but none the less its still the cure,its amazing how some people that dont know the cure and hear this cd and like it but dont like the songs that are good like classics as -to wish impossible things-fear of ghosts-strange day-just like heaven and so on. ps,the version of the cures world in my eyes totally kicked the originals [...]!As for buying this album go ahead and do it cause if your reading reviews to see if you want it you probally dont really know the cure and you probally will like it but its not for me......."
1,save your money,"Instead of buying this disc, get the Cure's Disintegration, or best hits collection. There is no ""Pictures of You"" on this current release..."
1,You want Bad?,"An album by a whining, paranoid snivler. What a piece of rubbish this is. I don't usually trash an artist's effort but this is really a poor effort. Unless you are a hardcore Cure fan steer clear."
1,intolerable,"awful, awful awful, how can people like this, its awful, go get your brains and pants examined"
4,Way to go Robert!!!,"I'm happy with this album. It is their hardest yet it reminds me a lot of Boys Don't Cry, good but in need of slight improvements (like the frickin 4 tracks on the vinyl version). The cure (i mean Robert) have been going through constant changes from punk (Boys don't cry/3 imaginary boys) hard gothic (pornography) to ""new wave"" (17 seconds) to pop (Wild Mood Swings), it was sort of obvious that they had to release a ""hard"" album they have and must experiment with new sounds and techniques that's what the cure are about, but stupid people want them to just stay in one niche market and not expand. How many times have I heard ""this is not disintegration or the next one hopefully will be disintegration"" well guess what I'd be disappointed if Robert rehashed a disintegration just to appease the fans. Screw the fans just keep doing what you've always been doing Rob."
2,cRaP!!!!..... is that a word?,"Wow, The Cure have hit a new low. I could tell this was going to be garbage from their shotty video for the single ""End of the World"" to the even worse cover art. Now that I've actually listened to the whole album straight through, I must say the music is worse than both the video and the cover art combined.Robert Smith's lyrics have grown trite and boring and the beautifully, dark melodies that we once heard on Disintegration, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Wish and even friggin Pornography are all gone. I don't know whether to blame the band or Ross Robinson. Either way this album is terrible. Oh and I must say that ""Never"" is possibly the worse song The Cure has ever written. It's almost hilariously bad.The only reason it gets two stars is because I was smart enough to buy the import which had more songs on it, one in particular which is actually very good and shows what could have been."
4,Amazing level of realism,"I am into simulations both in games and professionally in physics; and while I can see some aspects of how they try to ensure the driving is not too difficult or frustrating it is still an extremely detailed and accurate simulation of a Rally driving experience. I am especially amazed by how much realism they put into the interaction between the vehicle and the surround obstacles in the environment like bushes, trees, guard rails, roadsigns, fences, rocks, logs, and any other debris on or around the track. That includes bits and pieces of other cars that sustain damage during the race. I mention the damage modeling here almost as an aside but the only word to describe the detail and depth of the accurate simulation here is Awesome. You have to see it to believe it - I would recommend this game to any driving sim enthusiast."
5,One of the Best Racing Game,"I second all the good reviews on this game. I'm addicted to it and enjoying the challenge it is offering at every stage of the game. Complete justice to modern Hi-Def video games. Supports up to HD 1080p. High quality graphics. Dolby digital audio for the best sound experience.It takes a little practice for the beginners to get the handle on drifting. Once you master it, it is lot of fun.Don't have money to buy a real expensive race cars? Don't worry, this game will help you buy and drive the virtual ones :) There are plenty of awesome looking vehicles.Total entertainment. Very satisfied."
3,Good game,"It's a good game, its graphs are amazing. The only one problem is the unavailability to play with more than one player (under stand alone mode)."
4,Good game,"The latest installment in the Colin McRea series, DIRT puts you behind the wheel of some great cars and allows competition with others over the internet. Nice graphics and decent control of the vehicles.Dirt"
3,Dirt is ok,"Dirt is ok. I like most driving/racing games that Codemasters makes, so I bought this because of their reputation for me. I recently bought the PS3 and bought several games for it around the same time. I am currently concentrating on GRID, so my DIRT playing is limited. But, it's fine, I enjoy it when I do play it, but right now it's going to have to wait til I get through with GRID."
4,Good,"I bought Dirt inted of Dirt 2 because of the reviews of it. But I think I didn't to the right thing. The graphics quality is very very poor, especially if you have seen dirt 2.and to it get worse, after buying this I realized that is descontinued.if you can, buy dirt 2, not this one."
5,One of the best PS3 racing games!,"This game is my favorite. For as long as I've had it, I have played it for hours at a time. So much vehicle variety. My favorite are the rally and hill climb races but everything else is still great. Basically, if you want a good off road racing game, this doesn't disappoint. Get it!"
3,It's OK...,"Dirt is great, but it still feels a bit less ""real"" than the GT series, for example. It is quite challenging, however. It's still way better than any arcadish games and definitely much better than the older CMR Rally games.Rallycross events do feel more ""less-real"" than the rallies or hill-climbs, for some reason.Overall, if you are into racing on dirt and not looking for arcade fun, you'll like this game. A steering wheel can help this game tremendously. The controller is OK, but not as precise as you need to be."
5,Best rally game for PS3,"Great game if you love rally. Realistic graphics and handling, the lighting and background detail on the PS3 is a lot better than the 360. I think of motorstorm as more of a kid-fun boost until you blow-up kind of game, where as DiRT is a true rally enthusiast game with realistic damage.The only problem i have with this game is no multiplayer. I want to play with the person sitting next to me, not online, but all the new games seem to be that way."
4,Realistic Game,"I'm not one for video games, but this one is pretty fun. The graphics are done very well as does the realism of the driving, for using a game controller. As others have said, a steering wheel would help. It is hard to take turns properly with the PS3 controller since with the controller, you are either full throttle or not. I've tried playing online, but those who have steering wheels will always win. I still enjoy the game and it keeps my interest. They did a very good job at getting the tracks down to what they are in real life."
1,"Beyond B.S., it doesn't work","Mr. Pappadopoulos explained his system on a local Spokane radio station recently to sell his book and it worked.. I've met many folks around the BJ tables in this town who now use his system. The layout of his book is equally cunning in that it prefaces his ""hook"" with a legitimate concept.. Basic Strategy. The problem is that the ""hook"" is yet another progressive betting scheme that any true blackjack expert will tell you does not give you any more of a statistical advantage than Basic Strategy alone will give you. As you surf Amazon.com for a good blackjack book, remember one thing above all else: You cannot gain an advantage over the house without using a statistically proven card-counting system. To do so, go the the experts: Wong, Schlesinger, Uston, Clayton, Thorpe, Revere, etc."
1,"The ""secrets"" are still hidden","This pamphlet of 20 pages is disappointing. I simulated the stategy and was hard pressed to win 20% of the sessions. This, coupled with a flawed trend, bankroll and money management scheme, does not inspire confidence."
4,Straightforward,I've been looking for something that would cover the program evaluation process and this book does it in a straightforward way. There is a case study used as an example to walk you through the process as well as a worksheet to use for evaluation criteria and milestones. Major assessment concepts are also covered.It appears to be geared toward teachers who need to evaluate their schools' programs (e.g. NCLB) but anyone can use it as a guide.
3,Good player Poor teacher,"This Video is nice to listen to, but if you want to learn how to play the tunes I found it to be lacking. It was more of session to watch a great player play her songs and then have a host tell her how great she is. Very little teaching was presented."
4,Good Idea,I was looking for something that my Mom could hold onto while she tried to sit down in the front seat of the car. Whoever thought if this was right on the money. Just attach it to the window and a person has something to hold onto while they sit in the car. Very handy gadget for older people. I highly recommend it.
3,Watch the door,"This is okay, but as another person already mentioned, be very careful because it tends to pull the door shut!!"
3,"It's well-made, but didn't work for me.",I bought it because I am on crutches and thought it would make it easier to get out of the car. I can only put weight on one foot and had to push up from the seat. Pulling up didn't really help me. It also didn't work for my husband who has cerebral palsy. He needs the door to be still in order to get out of the car. The handle obviously pulls the car door in. I wouldn't recommend it for those with disabilities. It probably works better for older people who lack strength to stand easily.
1,"I'm sure this works great, but I wouldn't know because they didn't send me this one.","I ordered a Standers CarCaddie for my newly partially paralyzed mother for Christmas, and instead they sent me a Standers HandyBar instead. Thankfully, for my purposes the HandyBar should work fine, but that is still not what I ordered, and for many people who are expecting to get a CarCaddie the situation might not be as flexible. Standers, you need to correct your shipping process!! I wasn't notified that it would be different either. I was still charged the CarCaddie price (which was thankfully the cheaper of the two) but received a different product. I'm sure both are great, but you need to fix this! Buyers beware."
3,Good Quick Fix handle for Shoulder problems,"Although its adjustable, it tends to hang too low. Be aware that it will be thumping on the window if you are not hanging on to it. It is a good quick fix and works well with shoulder problems."
1,not a good thing,"i purchased this product to help my elderly father get out of his car, but as you pull on the handle, the door closes in on your legs. i am returning it."
5,GREAT INDEPENDENCE TOOL,I highly recommend this product...makes gettting in and out of the car much easier for my 98 year old Aunt.
2,Standers Car Caddie,Product was of very little help for assisting my Dad in/out of the car. When you pull on the car caddie to help get you out of the car it closes the door. You are not able to get the leverage needed to assist getting a person in and out of the car.
5,Uses it everyday!,"This little handy strap handle is terrific and my client uses it everyday.Never had any problem with door shutting on her, but she does make sure to open the door full and scoot out to edge of seat, then uses it to pull herself straight up.When she needs to she uses it in addition to the Handybar."
4,Handy but slips some,"Really like the item, but on one car, it slips on the window frame--just a bit, but can be disconcerting. I still like it."
2,"Great idea, lousy buckle","Great idea. But this company could spend a few cents more to put a good no-slip slider buckle on the strap where it adjusts. A few cents more. A touch of thought and quality where it counts. Nope. Shame. I hope to use it, but will always worry about pulling the strap through. I have other items with the proper buckle, and they work fine, no slip under most any condition. Hoping it holds when I need it."
3,Bonks grandma in the head while she's driving,I may not have researched this enough but don't recall seeing anything about the item moving around too much while driving. Maybe we didn't install it correctly. I'm just reporting that grandma couldn't stand it and it's now a handle I use to stabilize myself while climbing into the attic once a year after the Christmas stuff.
2,HEAVY,"While these sound great, they are two heavy and squeeze your head to tight causing aches under extended use. trying to loosen them up makes them fall off easy due to the weight."
1,Not What I had Hoped For,"I spent a lot of time researching headphones before I bought these. They had a strong reputation and were in a very good price range. I have a nice NAD C 370 Amp that I planned to listen to these through and was very excited. Looked pretty nice right out of the box and plugged them right in and commenced to playing some of my favorite jazz that I have listened to many times. The bass was rich and deep and nicely detailed. The midrange was a little flat and for me, the treble was abysmal. I felt like I was listening to these songs through a sheet rock wall from the other room. Perhaps it is my amp, which is known for having a very uncolored response, not flavoring the sound with much of anything that isn't there, which is added to a set of headphones that is flat in their imaging that is causing my disappointment. All I know is that I have had the NAD amp for five years and wouldn't trade it for anything. These headphones went in the box and back to the dealer."
2,a bit overpriced,I thought I was going to receive a purely quality product when I ordered my Koss Pro 4AAt's. They never seem to fit perfectly to my head which is an average size. There not as loud and definately not as punchy as I would expect for a 60 + dollar headphone. Should have bought the fake sony's. they are dripping with plastic parts and the earcups of course feel plastic and cheap. The gold plating is nice but a detachable cord would have been a great add on. overall not impressed will probably upgrade to AKG 240's
3,Awesome Sound...but heavy,"Bought them for the sound quality and lifetime warranty. After only one week of use I am pleased with the sound, but the weight of these is killing my neck. They do create a nice seal around my ears to block out noise, but my ears almost start sweating after and hour or so. Now, not to knock them too hard cause they are nice, but I have too big of a head for these. Fully extended the headpad still gives me a headache from resting and pressing up there. Great headphones for short listening periods and excellent sound quality, but just not fitting me right."
1,Plastic fantastic,"The sound is good, but the plastic construction is not very solid. One side has already broken, and the other one is about to break as well. After one side breaks they are trash. They have been in use for 24 months in an office setting."
2,weak sound unless you have a headphone amp,"The Koss Pro4AAT headphones are quality headphones, but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv. To get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about, you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp. Also, the ear pads are of a vinyl-like material which doesn't breathe well, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. I've read that leatherette pads are available, but so far haven't been able to find them. The warranty alone is great, but I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp."
4,Are these the right phones for you?,"After disappointing durability with Sony noise canceling headphones, which ate batteries and were quite flimsy, I bought the AAT's having owned a pair of Pro 4 AA phones in the 70's. They have good sound isolation without active sound canceling and have a lifetime warranty. That was the key deciding factors for me, as the Sony's have only a 90 day warranty.The sound is decent, although there are better sounding and much lighter phones out there. I won't buy a product with a 90 day warranty any more.Six months laster I am enjoying the sound just as much, and am living with the weight ok."
4,Most impressive.,"Not going to write much, as most has been posted on the site, but definitely get these headphones if you're looking in the 50-100 dollar range. Actually these are better than many higher-end(higher-priced)headphones I've tried. Only complaint is that the headphones might be slightly large and heavy - extended use makes for hot ears. Nevertheless,the sound quality is superb. You won't be dissapointed."
2,disappointed with the sound,"I have the new koss portapro's and the small koss titatium headphones which I purchased from amazon a few weeks ago. They sound real good and are small enough to take with you any where.So I though, why not order the koss pro4aat phones to use in my house only with various audio devices. I have tried them with a sterio 100 watt amplifier, portible radio, telivision and CD players. After using the smaller and cheaper koss phones first they are obviously much better sounding, and do not weigh a lot.I will never order Koss products with out trying them first.Don't be fooled in thinking these might be great by ordering them thru the internet and being disappointed about them."
2,Not very good.,"I had a friend who owned some Koss UR20s, and they were awesome headphones. The bass response was good, they were THE most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, and they've lasted a good many years.Contrasting this, I decided to ""go all out"" and buy some Pro4AATs. The statistics on the Pro4AAs were blowing the UR20s out, so I bought it.I've been dissatisfied with my purchase ever since.The Pro4AATs have mediocre bass response at best. The sound quality is thin. They weigh too much! I can't wear them for longer than an hour, because it presses down too hard on the top of my head.3 years later, I'm still using these Pro4AAs, and my friend is still using his UR20s. I did a sound test, and the UR20s still wup up on the Pro4AAs."
2,Shoddily Made -- greatly disappointed.,"I have a set of 30 year old Superex ProB VI headphones that are still going strong -- the Pro4 line has been around about as long, so I figured to try them out. Audio quality is FINE, but these headphones only lasted about 6 months before something broke. Looks like the sliding mechanism on the top ate the far channel. These have a ""lifetime warrantee"", so I sent them back, but that will end up costing about 25% of the purchase price. No excuse for such a poorly designed mechanism... sad to say, these apparently are made in the USA.Would not buy these again, sorry to say."
1,BE AWERE !!!,"I would not recommend this ""hi-end quality product"" to anyone, even for my enemy! I had terrible headaches all the time I was wearing these headphones more then one hour. They heavy and the head-piece is extremely uncomfortable. Sound quality is not that good that I was expecting."
5,As good as it gets,"I am a connoisseur of old classic country. I buy old Vinyl from Ebay, and Amazon. I have Polderbits software that allows recording to PC while cleaning out the crackle and pops, a filter for hiss and equalizer to replace some highs. I can honestly say listening to the end product is fantastic. Music from 50's 6o's 70's LP's should have a lot of noise when listening to earphones, quite the contrary the sound is better than when new. These phones are fantastic."
4,Heavy & hot but good sound,"If you don't know already these are heavy. I have a big head and I don't generally like a heavier set of headphones, but these are much too heavy to be comfortable. Additionally, and just as bad, they're hot! I'm a hothead and these remind me of that.If you can somehow overlook those two things these are a very good value. They have good sound for the price and seem like they will last a very long time. They have a well-balanced sound with good clarity. Once again for the price I'd say they're a good value.However I personally can't look beyond the comfort issue and had to sell them."
1,Not up to par,"I ordered the Pro4AAT phones about a year ago and thak God for lifetime warranty..They sound good,They are heavy,They are uncomfortable after being worn awhile,Not durable like the Pro4AA..I have had to send mine back twice..The first time for a short in the cable.The second time they fell and the ear piece broke off..The second pair I sent in they sent me a pair of Pro4AA's instead..It might have been a mistake,but I am a lot happier..I used to have a pair of these for years and love them..I can't recommend the Pro4AAT's for anyone who uses them professionally..They don't take abuse very well.."
3,Not the best of their own.,"I have owned Koss sporta pro which I rated highly. But this one, with much weaker bass and high, I can not rate it highly. I also have Sony-V6, which is also a close type of headphone, I hope this one can replace it. But this phone sounds much worse to me, no way to replace it. I could not believe Koss produce headphones sound so different.One factor is that phone is high impedance, it is supposed to be driven with a headphone amplifier for large volume. I do not have it, but in theory normal amplifier should have no trouble to get good sound except with smaller volume.If you have a headphone I mentioned above and try to replace it with 4aat, you should expect a different sound."
3,14 months later one side of the head phone died.,I used this heavily but took care of em and didnt blast the music in my ears and the right side of the headphone just died. I would say its not worth the price if they break in less than 2 years and I took care of these headphones but used them heavily maybe I got a bad batch but its hard trusting these ear phone agains espically for the price. thanks for nothing koss. although I will still use my dead headphones because they hide outside noises they wont be put to used as headphones as the right ear died on me.
2,Sticking with my vintage Koss Pro 4X Plus,"I have owned a pair of Koss Pro 4X Plus headphones for twenty plus years and the sound is incredible! I thought I would 'upgrade' after reading so much about the Pro4AAT and could not have been more disappointed. These sounds just awful. I do professional restoration work for Casey Kasem on American Top 40 and sound quality is everything in what I do.I concur with the complaints of other reviewers:1. The bass completely lacks and sounds like a roll-off at 100 Hz and below.2. The midrange is recessed and the highs are exaggerated. Overall the sound is harsh and brittle and really hollow.I could only take about 5 minutes and have to say these are the worst sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard in my life. A TOTAL waste of almost $100.As I said, the Pro 4X Plus has so much more dynamic range and response and I'll continue buying them up every time I see a pair come available."
3,Unusual for Koss Pros,"This is unusual for the Koss Pro line of headphones....but we purchased this set of KOSS phones as a gift for a college senior majoring in music. Unfortunately, the bass response is just not that good. We purchased a pair in the past and were very happy with them.. Although, for some reason this pair just isn't all that spectacular. KOSS does offer an awesome return guarantee for full replacement, it is just that we are hoping that this was a singulare instance and that the replacement pair will have the bass response we anticipated from KOSS."
2,Short Range and lots of noise...,"I have never tried other wireless headphones, so I did not know what to expect. These headphones will only work in the room where the base is...that is not too much of a problem because I use them to watch movies when others in the house need quiet, but the amount of hiss and noise is quite distracting. No matter how I fiddled with the volume of the unit and the volume of the surround sound system I could still hear it.One other thing that may be purely personal: I usually am reclining on the sofa when I watch the movies, with my head propped on pillows--these headphones have a ""behind the head"" design that is much less comfortable when you are laying back.The only really good thing for me was the price, but I would be willing to pay more to solve these problems."
2,Below my expectations,"When I bought the headphone, it seemed the best option: light, cheap, good brand.But using it was kind of disapointing. Even at 3,4 feet away you hear a background squeaking.When I had to get new batteries (after 2 months of far-less-than-intense use) I broke the little piece of plastic that holds the battery cover.I am still using (I got used to the squeaking), but as soon as I have a chance I will look for something better.UPDATE (02/01/06): I've lost my patience. It went to garbage. Spend more money and buy something better."
2,Disappointed with Infrared Technology,This is the 1st set of cordless speakers I've tried. I was warned about about IR vs radio frequency technology. I should have listened to the advice. RF is much better than IR.I would not recommend these headphones
2,Too Flimsy for family room,"We bought these to use for the family room TV so teenagers could play games or watch videos without all the noise. These headphones sound OK, but the construction is very flimsy- headband broke in 3 weeks. Sony wireless phones have more robust construction and lasted for several years in the same application before being moved to a different room. We're goong back to the Sonys."
2,Uncomfortable to wear,"First the upsides - price, easy to use, and acceptable sound quality. The downsides for me are mainly comfort when wearing them. Because they are a 'behind the neck type headphone, I believe that the tension of the spring wire that connects the 2 earpieces is to great. There is no adjustment for this (one size fits all). To compound the problem there is not much padding on the earpieces. If I was to buy another set of headphones, I would opt for the over the head design with large, well padded over the ear type earpieces. If you are like me and wear a large hat size, don't buy these as you might experience the problem that I am having. However, maybe someone with a smaller hat could wear them."
3,Better have line of sight. . .,"These headphones are comfortable and have pretty good sound for the price, but you really must have a direct line of sight between the headphones and the base. If you are lying in bed, don't prop your knees up or pull the blanket up over your head. . .this will cut the signal entirely."
2,I've read better,"Not a very good book. The author is overly opinionated and not very open to conflicting ideas. He also does not do a very good job in educating the reader on economic concepts he uses to support his views. Overall, I would say it's not worth the time or money."
5,The Armchair Economist,Landsburg does more to explain what economics is really all about then all the textbooks I've read put together. It should be mandatory reading for all highschool civics classes. Great illustrations of proper economic thought processes that will enlighten all readers of any age.
3,"If you like Pop Economics (like Freakonomics) & you read alot, then this is a good book",Nothing spectacular. Nothing splashy. But it kept me awake for about 3 hours & I think I'm smarter afterward.
3,Meh,"The author seems to contradict himself here and there, beyond which he makes horrible logical mistakes when he gets into talking about the income gap (IMO)."
3,wooohooo,i got it. i got it on time. it was necessary for my econ class in brigham young university. yeah.
3,"Thoughtful, but devoid of detail","Landsburg's book should be entertaining for persons interested in learning basic economics. His style is a bit questionable, in that he can occasionally be found lost in self-argumentative circularism. I found David D. Friedman's book 'Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life' a more valuable book. As a singular example, his discussion of the price of popcorn in theaters seems, intuitively, better than Landsburg's."
2,Good but starting to sound a bit dated,"While the book has some interesting parables and anecdotes and is an engaging look at some problems from the ""man is a rational agent"" perspective, this mantra starts to get a bit tiring after a while (and is also starting to sound a bit dated with recent developments in the field).My main gripe however was the author's style. Arrogant and condescending, I found the book hard to get through at points - despite being interested in the content."
2,Organizational Issues,"This text is required for my graduate level voice disorders class for Speech Pathology. After reading the text, I found that it was poorly organized and difficult to read. This book does not provide a glossary and never defines many technical terms. I found myself reading the text with a dictionary open. I also found it odd that some of the voice techniques were randomly embedded in case studies. For example, the proper way to shout is located under a case study on phonotrauma in children. I believe that something as important as a vocal technique should at least get its own heading."
3,Informative but difficult to follow,"This book covers the topic of voice disorders very well, however I don't believe the organization within the chapters is very well done."
3,Dated Bronson,"Not a bad story for its period. However it reminds me of the Kenneth More character in ""39 Steps"". Both male leads have a condescending attitude toward 'NAIVE' ladies. Maybe that helps one identify this as a 'Period Piece'."
1,Poor quality peppercorns,"I bought a bag of these peppercorns last Christmas. My whole family agreed, they smelled and tasted awful, kind of a ""barnyard"" smell. I have used other brands of mixed peppercorns and never smelled or tasted anything this bad. Ended up just throwing the rest of the bag away. Not recommended."
5,Supreme,There are no finer works than these and these are superior performances recorded by professionals in an ideal live setting.
2,Still a mystery.....,"The Cure's mysterious rise remains more puzzling than ever after this snip'n'paste rummage through the usual gamut of press clippings. With stunning banality, inter-band frictions are reduced to soap-opera absurdity, and Robert Smith's notoriously quixotic working methods are judged almost entirely on whatever PR line the press were fed at the time. There's a terrific Fear And Loathing-style saga to be written about this boozy, chaotic combo, but Faith is just an overwhelmingly partisan fan-study."
5,"Durable Construction, Multi-Purpose Saw","The handle looks like it is made of plastic in the supplied image but it is actually composed of a molded metal composite with a rubber grip. The blade is a bit flimpsy for my use but it is an 18"" saw. General purpose blade also cuts plywood, plaster board, and paneling in addition to PVC. Also, as stated, the blade can mount either vertically or horizontally.An excellent saw for the price. I would recommend the 12"" blade if you are questioning size."
3,Finally I'm done!,"While this book was well written, it took me months to get through it. It just didn't hold my interest. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the author going back and forth with the two stories between Jesus & Mary Magdalene and the priest and Marie, distracting. I did not enjoy this book. It doesn't mean the book was bad; it just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not going to recommend it because of my own personal tastes, but others, I see, did really enjoy the book."
3,Chocolate!,It tastes great in a fruit smoothie. It costs is the only thing prohibiting me from keeping it in stock in my kitchen. It was delivered in a timely manner.
2,Bushcraft,"A good coffee table book,But far too heavy and impractical for taking with you camping/travelling.Illustrations dark and not clear.Same old information,which has already been written by others."
3,Meh- it was okay...,I bought this book as a gift for my bridesmaids for when I asked them. They all live in different states so this was a cute gift to mail to them with the ask inside... but the book itself is about one flip through then you'll probably never look at it again.
2,Not for Bridesmaids in their 20's,"I bought 4 of these books to give to my bridesmaids as part of their gift at the rehearsal dinner. It's a cute book/good concept, but I was expecting more modern pictures. There are some classic giant-sleeved 80's dresses, but for the most part, the pictures all look like they are from the 1960's or 1970's. Don't get me wrong - the dresses are hideous to someone in their 20's, but those were just the styles back then. The fewer modern dresses in the book just aren't that bad - I've seen/worn much worse. I think this book would be funnier to someone in their 50's looking back than to young brides/bridesmaids today."
4,Excellent Fourth Way movie.,This is a really excellent little movie that seems to achieve exactly what it sets out to do.I really enjoyed it.
5,Comedy Dvd,I enjoy a good laugh! I like all the comedians that are on this dvd. They are very funny people. :) THanks!
5,Yummy !!!,"I love this fragrance. I can never get enough of it. The scent is fresh, not ""heavy"" or ""perfumey"", if you know what I mean.If you are woman who likes fresh, happy, optimistic scents, with a splash of citrus, this is for you."
4,Loving waste in a bath,"What a wonderful novel Purple America is. I deeply admire Moody's intensity, his choice of words, his ability to create a consistent character from failed boyhood to failed manhood. I especially loved looking for parallels between the decaying old Millstone nuclear power plant and the decaying old mother laying waste in her tub. Whether it was intentional or not is unimportant. It worked. I believe this novel will be studied and read for a long time."
5,I think some people miss the point on this one...,"... the language is tricky at times, and he likes to get into those categorical lists, which may come across as tangential wandering, but to me its quite brilliant. The first five or so pages count as probably among the best writing I have ever read. Very meditative, like an incantation, a style which resonates throughout the book. I guess the only reason I'm writing this review is becasue this book needs to be read and studied; not enough people recognize its beauty. It's easy to read it quickly and not let it get to you. Read it slowly. A great improvement over Garden State, I think, and just as if not more satsifying than The Ice Storm. Please read it."
4,Wasp Death,"Reading Rick Moody's Purple America is like spying on a dysfunctional family's bathroom, you see everything. Read this novel at your own risk, for you will experience decay and destruction with little catharsis. The writing is as well done as you could ask. The characters are well rounded and believable. My only issue with this novel is that I came to the table ill prepared to handle the depressing narration. So, read it but realize what you are in for."
3,"Good enough read, not enough photos","I am currently 1/4 of the way through this and I keep wishing some photos of these places had been included. I'm a bit surprised that a story about such unusual places has no photographs of such. The few photos in the story are mainly of people, although I did see one of a sign and someone's wall. Very dissatisfying.I spent some time looking on the web but some of the places he described have since changed (in some cases drastically) and I have not, as yet, found any photos showing some of the things he describes. In particular, Whittier Alaska is now inundated with thousands of tourists from cruise ships every year. It would have been nice to see photos of it beforehand.A decent read but if you're like me, you'll be spending time online trying to find some visuals to enhance the experience of learning about these places."
5,No Nomads Here,"Imagine living in a home surrounded by lava flows, or on a small island where hurricanes are common and the one road out will be covered with water well before the storm hits. Jack Halpern has given a view, not only of five very extreme living conditions, but also of the strong-willed people who tenaciously cling to the place they call home. It is hard to decide which is more memorable, the unforgiving land or the people who weather the elements. For these hardy souls, home is a place of roots and continuity, a tenuous place in reality but a concrete place in mind, a place that truly defines them."
1,"No customer support, broke after one week.","The SoleusAir MS-14R stopped working after one week of very light use. The heating element simply burned out.I attempted to contact customer service on two occasions. On the first attempt got an operator; however, when I asked for customer service, I was told ""call back in an hour, he is on his lunch break"". So they only have one customer service representative?I didn't call back in an hour (I forgot about the soleusair). I called back a few days later, all I could get was a machine.I will not buy another SoleusAir product."
3,so-so product,"The heater stopped functioning (the reason was not apparent) and, even through it was still under warrantee. I decided I didn't like the product enough to bother with having it repaired. The heater distributed heat well throughout the room but the heating element glowed very brightly, like a low wattage light bulb, and I found that to be an annoyance. For example, the brightness of the heating element interfered with watching TV because I like my viewing room to have dim lighting. This would not be a problem in well lit rooms."
1,Lasted about four hours,"We received the MS-14R Reflective Tower Heater made by Soleusair late this morning. I assembled it and turned it on. Worked great for about four hours. Now the reflective bulb will not come on. The power light is on, the unit will oscillate, but the bulb will not turn on. I unplugged the unit for 20 minutes and plugged it back it. This did not help.I called their customer support. They want me to cut the plug off the unit and mail it to them in California, then they say they will send me another unit. Winter will be over by the time I get it if the plug doesn't get ""lost"" along the way to them.We'll see what happens."
4,excellent product,"It is very difficult to find a good powdered multi for a reasonable price. Fortunately there is this product. Admittedly, some don't like the taste (it tastes OK to me). But if you don't like it, all you have to do is put it in a smoothie or something. Great product, great nutrition, great price."
4,Great coffee book,"This book gives a good basic understanding of what coffee is all about. I especially like the specificity of information about coffees from different areas in the Regional Character chapter. For example, discussing Costa Rica's two best growing areas and how the coffees differ. I also found the opinions of which coffees are worthy of their price helpful. I read the Perfect Cup first and am glad I did because it was a good coffee overview for me. Coffee Basics was a great second book for me because I was looking for more specific information about coffees of each area. If I hadn't read Perfect Cup first I think the break down of info. on each type of coffee/regional character would have been information overload for me. If you are new or relatively new to the coffee world and are excited about learning more and more about the subtlties and nuiances present in that cup, I highly recommend you read this book."
4,Coffee 101,"This is a good book that explains in simple language about coffee basics. The history, origins and how beans are grown, picked and processed before roasting. Includes the different methods of making coffee and the expected results. It offers comprehensive and excellent information about espresso; an expensive investment. There are no illusions or heavy product endorsing in this book. I paid over $14 for it, and discovered I had many misconceptions about storing and brewing. With less than $100 in equipment, I am now enjoying a fabulous cup of java in the morning."
3,One word: BADASS,"Personally, I don't like death metal, but this band has changed my mind. The guitar is sooo great I could listen to this band for hours straight. I haven't ordered any of their other albums, but after hearing this one, I plan on doing it. They don't really have any horrible songs on this CD so I could listen to this album without pressing the ""Skip"" button. I suggest if you like metal, you order this CD."
2,SUNGS ARE VERRY GOTHICK,THE MUSICK IS OK FOR HAVEY MEATEL BAND EVEN FOR A SLAYER FAN TJHE MUSICK Was good but the lyricks were crude overall my grade c+
5,"This is the best from Slayer since ""South of Heaven""","It is comforting to know that there is another band that refuses to become what MTV has turned Metallica into. DIABOLUS IN MUSICA is hard, fast, and loud. Everything that a Slayer album should be.J.B. - San Jose"
4,"Music rules, lyrics are lacking.","Slayer once again demonstrate why the edge of the music continuum ends with them!! This album is hard and fast like the Slayer of years back. However the lyrics are not terribly exciting and at times are plain stupid. But then again, the musical force and fury has always been Slayer's contribution to the scene while vocals only helped support their electrical power. Check it out and discover the feeling of musically induced mayhem!"
3,Hanneman writes;Araya and King sleep,"Although I'm liking the album a little more each time I listen to it I have to say that the production quality of this album is lacking. The album is certainly not representative of a four year absence of new material. I didn't really like the sound of ""Gemini"" on their previous release and DiM sounds the same. The first minute of the first song (like the first thirty seconds of ""Gemini"") just has the music waiting to go somewhere (and it eventually does). The drums on both UA and DiM have got to go. Bostaph had a steady underlying rhythm in DI but sounded terrible in the last two releases. I also don't understand Araya's bass either. Slayer is a guitar oriented band. Why are the bass and drums drowning them out? Had this album been a more collaborative effort it definitely would have been better."
4,"They're back,Slayer dishes out another spoonful of brutality","People ask, ""What happened to Heavy Metal?' Well Slayer swallowed it whole and has spewed out some of their most brutal, driven works of yet. Boasting the speed that made them The Kings of Thrash, and some meaty slower chops that are as heavy as a five pound steak. Slayer once again has created a masterpiece. Can you digest it???"
5,This album is great!,"Hey, Diabolus in Musica is a great album, I encourage everyone to go buy it now!!!"
4,Slayer delivers again,What more to expect than an excellent album from these metal gods. Slayer experiments with new ideas without losing their roots and most importantly staying loyal to their fans. Long Live Slayer!
5,the Return,"Wow, they are defenatly back. Get this if your a fan of Slayer. Trust me on it, just short of greatness. This Album is just right behind ""Regin In blood"" In my book. It may not be as fast, but yet still VERY catchy. Thank you, buy it!"
4,"A grower. Still, inferior to their 80s material","Like many reviewers here stated, this album will probably grow on you with time and repeated spins. Just like it did on me. It's a far cry from what classic Slayer played, yet, a good one in its own right.This record doesn't offer much in terms of classic thrash assets, like solos, melody, complex rhythms, etc. Instead, it further moves Slayer sound into hardcore realm. The music is all about playing heavy simple instrumentals with ferocious p**sed-off vocals of Tom layered over the music. But it works!A very angry recording."
3,Good.....but......,"As Slayer is my favorite band I had been expecting this album for quite a long time. But I must say that although it's pretty good it's not even close to what I expected. It doesn't have some of that ""Slayer spice"" that the other albums had. In particular songs like ""Love to hate"" sound so not Slayer.My advice: If you like metal and/or Slayer buy it. But if you're choosing between this album and any previous album then go for any other first."
5,DIABOLUS IN MUSICA:ALL THE DEATH AND CGAOS YOU CAN ASK FOR,SLAYER HAS DONE IT AGAIN! THE NEW DIABOLUS IN MUSICA WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD. I FELT IT WOULD BE A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT BUT THEY MANAGED TO PROVE ME WRONG. THE HARDCORE STYLE IS EXTREMLY WELL DONE. TOM ARAYA'S VOCALS AND GUITAR WORK FROM KING AND HANNEMAN MAKE THIS CD ALL A TRUE METAL FAN CAN ASK FOR! BASICALLY TWO WORDS BUY IT!!!
3,"IT'S OKAY, BUT IT DIDN'T GIVE ME THE RUSH!","Slayer has been around for a long time, and every new album that comes out is becoming dumber and dumber. Yeah Kerry King kicks on the guitar, but the lyrics have no point to them. To me, this band is pretty silly, as they try to put on this stupid image that isn't them. You wanna a real metal album, go look for PANTERA cd's, they are much better and more honest with the fans. Sorry, slayer, you could have done better!"
3,"Could, would, and should have been better","For Slayer, ""Diabolus in Musica"" is mediocre at best, this could, should, and would have been better, but for some reason the total package here feels rushed. Other than ""Point"" and ""Stain of Mind"" nothing else here is really memorable and it just sounds like Slayer was writing mostly filler material. However there are some good points; the music has a very dark and sinister groove that saves ""Diabolus in Musica"" from being a flop. All in all, this isn't a bad album by any means, but I expected a lot better from Slayer (check out their latest, ""God Hates Us All"" which is a lot better). If you don't allready have every Slayer album, or your deciding which ones to buy, get this last."
2,Slayers Worst Album,"I like Nu-MEtal...But I think bands like slayer should stick to what they do best...Old school sounding thrash/Death Metal.This Record is way to ""Nu"" sounding for a Slayer Release.I dont need to Hear Tom Arya Rap.I know that bands like to try new things,but slayer took it way to far on this CD.This CD is bad for a slayer CD...But I would take a mediocre Slayer CD over alot of other Garbage out there today.This CD does have its gems.""Bitter Peace"" is a great old school sounding song.""desire"" sounds like it could have been on the SOH record.But they are trying way to hard not to sound like a thrash band that was born in the 80's on this CD...If you are buying a Slayer CD for the first time I recomend ""South of HEaven"" or ""Hell Awaits"" buy this one last to fill out your SLAYER collection."
4,Slayer keeps it real...,"Slayer is my alternative to Sepultura. Sepultura puts out the CD ""against"". Slayer puts out ""devil in music"". Sepultura ""sells out"". Slayer ""keeps it real"". Don't get me wrong. I did not give this album the five stars. But they deserve something for keeping the Slayer sound in tact. With the exception of ""Divine Intervention"" and ""Undisputed Attitude"", Slayer has put out great albums since ""South of heaven"". Is this a great album? Well, no. But a good one? Yes... Any loyal fan should buy this one. Just like family and friends. You stick with them even through struggles."
2,Letdown.,"I wanted to love this CD. Just look at the artwork in the booklet and behind the CD! A man shot in the head, his blood all over the wall behind him, a whole line of needles sticking in the underside of someone's arm, and a pair of lips sewn shut! Rock on!But sadly the music just doesn't live up the imagery. Standout tracks are only ""Bitter Peace"" and ""Point"" which are the two more aggressive songs on the CD.This was Slayer's most experimental album, an attempt to incorporate elements of the popular (and very awful) nu-metal genre which had appeared around this time. It's somewhat interesting to listen to, but the songwriting just feels weak and lacking compared to earlier works. Something just doesn't quite work in most of the songs but I can't figure out definitively what.You'll have to really be into Slayer to jump for this one."
2,Their weakest effort,"Enamored by bands like Machine Head and Pantera, whose sound, ironically, owes much to Slayer's classic 80s albums, Slayer decided to unleash Diabolous in Music upon the world in 1998. Talk about poor career moves. Downtuned guitar riffs that could be played by a 5 year old, poor songwriting, and Tom Araya struggling to sing like he used to... this is all anybody should expect from Diabolous.After a killer opening track (Bitter Peace), DiM quickly heads downhill into monotonous borefest after monotonous borefest (STAIN OF MIND?). Towards the end, things pick up a bit (In the Name of God is a good song, as is Screaming from the Sky), but a few redeeming moments do not save this pile of dumpster fodder from mediocrity.The question is: WHAT HAPPENED? How could Slayer fall so far? Who knows exactly what they were thinking when they recorded Diabolous... and maybe it's better we don't."
2,inconsistipated,"slayer are taking themselves too seriously here and while it pays off with a few amazing tracks like stain of mind, some songs are complete crap, leave a stain on your mind...maybe make you just a little more degenerate who knows what they're thinking, much of these perversion lyrics are ugly in a bad way, that is, just stupid...listen degenerate satanists; seasons and divine int. are better albums. this one is inconsistent, some perfect tracks to take a really mad, pissed off dump to. the test of a slayer album is how it sounds when you're wired on coffee, or whatever stimulant you prefer i suppose and this one FAILs. but my 2 star ambivalence comes from the songs that work, where the band is amazingly tight and angry sounding like never before, menacing... in any case the title of the album is appropriate."
1,Talk about selling out!,"If you liked Divine Intervention or anything before it, don't even think about buying this album. Everything is about half speed, and the drumming is just horribly slow. The guitar riffs sound recycled, and are obviously uninspired. Slayer used to have some talent, but I'm not sure where it went. Apparently, judging by the vocals, they just sold out to the rap-rock fad. It's a sad day for true metal."
2,THEIR WEAKEST ALBUM.,I was very disappointed when I first bought this album because it sounded weak and uninspired.This cd reminded me of metallica's load.Poor song writing and some poor vocals.I think slayer hit their peak with divine intervention and have gone downhill ever since.Avoid this album and get any of their previous albums.Goodbye for now.
3,decent release from a great band,"when I first heard this album I though ""what a disaster!"" Now , a few months later, I really enjoy listening to this album. The bottom line is this: If your a fan of their older material you will be disappointed, and if your under 20 and a fan of new hard metal bands (Korn, Pantera) you will probably like it. What impresses me most about this release is that they are in thier 30's and due to that the music is not as creative, but they still rock hard!!. Wimp out is something Slayer will not be accused of anytime soon. This sounds like it was recorded in a subway. Its harsh and easiely the one of the most difficult of thier albums to listen to. Very good thrash."
4,GREAT,This is a great album. But Slayer already pumped out their absolute best way back when. I love this album simply because it's hard to find anything even remotely heavy thats also good anymore. Death's Head is my favorite song off DIM.
2,"Greatest Thrash band of the 80's, lets keep it that way","dude, i used to be a die hard slayer fan. they were my absolute favs. Reign in Blood still kicks a** after 1000+ listenings. i also play music. i feel that i am a good judgement of great metal. this isnt it. they are tired and out of fresh ideas. old school fans...dont bother. if youre a new fan, maybe you'll disagree, but the lyrics are rediculous and guitar substandard slayer. some really cool riffs mixed in the boring verses and catchy hooks, but still ive listened once and i dont care to again. i'll still listen to the old stuff though!!!!"
4,ahead of its time,"How anyone accuses Slayer of selling out to the rock/rap of the 90's era I'll never know. Araya doesn't come anywhere close to rapping on these tracks. I've got to admit though, I hated it when it was first released. I'm 34 now and have been listening to Slayer since I was in high school. That said, I was used to RiB/SoH/SitA and hated the mods made in this release. I got away from metal for years when it went with the rock/rap garbage (Linkin Park...ugh!!). That said, Lamb of God brought me back and I started downloading a lot of older material that I'd gotten rid of over the years. I spent the money and redownloaded this album and am pleasently surprised. The sound is far head of its time. Deaths Head is an awesome track along with Love to Hate. Lots of memorable tracks on here on a release too often overlooked."
4,Very good but could be better,This cd is alittle more diverse than their previous albums. If it was heavier I would of gave it 5 stars. Still nice speed metal by one of the best thrash/metal bands out there. Just a few fillers that bring this cd down... My favorite song is track 4!! Bad ass riffs and the drums are kicking.
3,"Better than some,worse than others",This CD is not bad once you get used to it. The best song on here in my opinion is Stain of Mind. It does have a more darker theme with the music than the others do. It does have a tendency to get monotnous after the first 5 songs though. In my opinion they could have done better with the lyrical content. Most of the songs seem to be about the same thing just in a different way. Not Slayer's best but not their worst either.
4,A good first impression,"This was my first Slayer experience. As a drummer, I was really floored by the job Paul Bostaph did on this album. He plays with such ferocity, precision, and speed. The sound of the drums is just amazing! For the album in general, great sound, great chops, great stuff."
4,Consistency in Musica,"A band needs to evolve to survive. Darwin wrote this in his theory of Natural Law. I like Diabolus. It doesn't display the power and spirit of the earlier albums, but it's a far cry from sellout corporate metal as well as anything that's been released in the last decade. Power is exposed in ""Bitter Peace"" and ""Death's Head"" is incredibly avant garde for a Slayer song. ""Stain of Mind"" is a concert fave while ""In the Name of God"" maintains Slayer's cynical vision of worship. Other good songs include ""Screaming from the Sky"", ""Point"", and ""Perversions of Pain"".""Overt Enemy"" could have been left off of the album. It's too drawn out and boosts the track count to an atypical eleven. And there is no hint of 'hardcore' on this cd at all. Atreyu must provoke delusion."
5,My favorite Slayer album,"I totally agree with most reviewers that this is a departure from what we've come to expect from the band, and I certainly don't think it's their best album at all. Diabolus just has straight up, loud, in your face power. Bostaph is totally on and Rick Rubin did a phenomenal job with the production."
2,Disappointing Diabolus,"After a lengthy break from UNDISPUTED ATTITUDE, the kings of speed metal return with a lackluster album. After the first three tracks which range from mediocre to above average, the album goes downhill. No melodies or riffs stick to your skull like past records, and nothing exciting happens. You can give this repeated listens all you want, but this won't even come close to SEASONS, UNDISPUTED, or GOD HATES. A real shame."
1,"slayer is not very good, i bought the album.","Exaggeration is what this band is all about. i still cannot till this day understand what is so special about this band. i bought this album and was surprised that the solo stink and that the rhythm is very slow. one would think that guitar intensity would be alot like american hi fi or like immortal.it does not matter who it is, but anyone who listens to slayer must be in some type of trance (hypnotized)because this band is not that good. but like always, the masses enjoy not the so good stuff. diabolus in musica is a no show. the drummer is not heavy at all. the long hair, the ripped jeans and tattoos is what makes these guys not their music. ohh, diabolus in musica must be latin standing for diabolical being in music."
2,A pretty weak album - 2.5 stars,"Slayer released Diablos in Musica in 1998. This is a decent thrash album, but definitely not up to Slayer's standards. Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated. These people are entitled to their opinion. That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album. Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music. His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now). Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.This is the Slayer album I listen to the least. There are song good songs: Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky. Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring."
2,its ok,"this is an ok cd, ill listen to it if im bored or something, slayer isnt at all a really good band, but they did something here, they made there music sound ok, slayer is getting stronger....."
4,A must-buy for Slayer fans,"If you like Slayer, and were a little disappointed by the previous release, you must buy this one."
4,KILLER CD,"I have to rate it lower that other Slayer albums but it is definatly an awesome CD. It keeps up w/ all their other albums and experiments w/ Toms voice a little more. But other than that it is an instanT classic. If you're a Slayer fan you already know this but if your not and just looking for a good cd that thrashes w/ the best of 'em get this one. No new CD will match up. Other awesome Slaytanic CDs include Divine Intervention and Reign in Blood. This is not their best album by far, but it IS Slayer and it does rule and it deserves to be listened to."
3,Monotonous In Musica,"Slayer continues to put a half-hearted effort out for the general public. The first three songs on this album are the tracks that received the most work, but it's obvious by listening to the last half of the album that they need to continue expanding their style. Most metal bands get chewed out for changing their style, but Slayer might actually do themselves a favor by opting for a new guitar sound...maybe dumping Rick Rubin would be a start to that. Still, the first three tracks are worth checking out, thus the three star review."
2,"Oh wow, what happened?","For the first time I was bored by a Slayer album. Technically, the musicianship and production are great. However, the songs are sort of blah and after several listens I buried in my cd collection. Pulled it out a few months later hoping for something to sound different but it didn't so I sold it at the local used cd shop. But since they are a great band who have done better work in the past, I'll still give the next one a chance."
2,Poor Slayer. Poor Us.,"Remember the good old days? Seasons in the Abyss... Reign in Blood... South of Heaven. Slayer was the king of thrash metal. I remember those days too, which why I have to say that this sludgy, droning album must have been made by alien imposters. The tracks are interchangeable, and none are memorable. Sure, it's heavy, but in that phlegmatic Godsmack kind of way. Buy their ealier albums if you don't yet have them, you won't regret it."
2,Losin' speed,"This album is not as good as these people say it is. It DOES sound like Korn or Biohazard, a.k.a BORING! Older Slayer albums have raw energy. This one seemed over-produced and fabricated for mainstream; at least, that's how it sounds to me..."
4,A Very Decent Album- But they have Done Better,"This 98 release see's slayer trying to open thier music to a larger audience. Araya's vocals are not at thier peak. But maybe I am unfairly comparing this album to the masterpiece ""Reign in Blood"". This is a decent album worth buying. Bottom Line but not for those who like old old slayer"
4,Over-criticized....,"Please, people. Some of you people are way to hard on this album. While some of you consider it a ""sellout"", and some of you don't like it because it can get repetitive, I love this album and still think it rocks hard. Sure, it is a bit repetitive, and it's not the same sound that Slayer patented back in the Haunting the Chapel days, but...is that necessarily a bad thing? Songs like ""Bitter Peace"", ""Death's Head"", ""Love to Hate"", ""Perversions of Pain"", ""Scrum"", ""Point"", ""In the name of God"" all rock, some in a different way then before. And while their seems to be more of a neo-metal influence, this album should prove that Slayer isn't dead."
1,Atrocious,"I wish I had seen the other reviews before renting this movie. I also thought it was the other movie, THE black dahlia. This version is uncredible atrocious, with a totally incomprehensible plot, real bad acting and a similar stupid ending. It manages to be gory and boring at the same time, through endless repetition of nasty torture scenes. I can only agree with all the other reviewers. Don't waste you time and money on this."
1,"Ulli Lommel, please stop making movies...Go flip burgers.",How does something this poor in quality get made and released? Any starving student film-maker can blow away this amateurish endeavor with half their brain cells tied behind their back. It seems like no one involved with this project had the vaguest hint of talent or ability. Even the gaffer and best boy were lousy.
3,Ulli Lommel's The Black Dahlia,"Ulli Lommel's The Black Dahlia is a horror film that takes place in 21st Century L.A. A crazed Gulf War veteran and her cohort stage fake auditions looking for another ""Black Dahlia"". Not only was this psycho groomed by the Army to torture (she has a lot of flashbacks) but is tied to the last missing link from the original unsolved mystery of the original Black Dahlia (who's shown in flashbacks and looks hot). A nosy cop and a bunch of dead bodies points towards a weird old man and a warehouse.Shot on digital video and very gory for an R-Rated film. If you like low budget DTV horror and know what kind of films Ulli Lommel makes, then you'll want to watch this one. Others need not apply."
1,This is not the Brian DePalma movie,"Just to help those looking for the Black Dahlia with Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johanssen, This is a different movie completely. This film is made by a really awful german horror film director who for some reason, continually pumps out terrible films. Most of them are only watched because he is constantly exploiting other current movies. Like this film which came out close to the time of Brian DePalma's film. This director also made a film called Boogey Man, which not surprisingly is almost a scene for scene remake of John Carpenter's Halloween. That is so far his most successful film (and that should tell you something about the film makers talent).Avoid at all cost!!! Unless you recieve a sick thrill from bad films"
1,11 Minutes - To Turn It Off,"Could a movie stink any worse than this? Between the constant flashing back and forth and the horrendous acting, not to my knowledge.It took only 11 Minutes - To Turn It Off."
1,Let me save you time and money,"Not only is this movie poorly shot, but poorly, if at all, researched. How could you NOT KNOW how the Black Dahlia was killed? And if you didn't and were going to make a movie about THE MOST FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD MURDER, don't you think you should at least take a peek at the facts? Hmmm? This is all the time I'm wasting on this silly movie."
1,I can't remember watching a worse movie.,"I don't want to waste any more time on this movie then I already have. Just don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't watch it on cable. Don't even watch it on broadcast TV. Stay far away from it. Every individual involved with the making of this film has a special space reserved for them in hell.Lionsgate also has a space reserved for tricking people into watching this movie by having its DVD release coincide with the DePalma film of the same name. Very Cheesy.Once again, do not watch this movie. You will lose half your brain function just by picking up the case."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't waste your time on this money. I could film this ""thing"" in my basement for about $100.00. Could this movie be any worse? The answer is NO NO NO NO NO!!!!! Watching the grass grow in the middle of winter would be more entertaining than this flick. I only give it one star because you can't give it no stars."
2,Bizarre and derivative,"I rented this accidentally a few weeks ago, thinking it was Brian DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia."" But this one, Uli Lommel's Black Dahlia, is a whole other beast. It basically centers around a cute, psychotic girl (who stole Sheri Moon Zombie's laugh and fashion sense) and her two silent henchmen in helmets who hold auditions in abandoned buildings for the next Black Dahlia. Anyone who's not ""right for the part"" is cheerfully tortured and killed, complete with random nudity and dancing in blood. There's a bizarre subplot with idiotic detectives and an old man to whom psycho girl is caretaker or somehow related, who may have killed the original Black Dahlia and wants to try a new one . . .The whole deal is several shades of rotten, from the z-movie budget to the random Eon McKai-style editing. It doesn't even fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category, but I threw in an extra star because I'm sure it would be incredibly funny if you were drunk."
1,Five thumbs down!,"This was perhaps my dear husbands biggest movie mistake ever. He had heard that the Black Dahlia was a good movie. I, of course concurred, but after five minutes viewing something seemed terribly wrong.I've read Black Dahlia and this didn't seem much like what I'd envisioned.I truly have never viewed as much gratuitous violence, or as poorly done as appeared in this film.Warning to all there is nothing, not one thing redeeming in this film..."
4,Bwahahaha,This movie is Great! It's like a cheap Rob Zombie film. If you like sick humor or funny horror you'll probably enjoy this one.
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!,This is NOT the movie about the Black Dahlia that stars Hillary Swank and Josh Hartnett. It's a shamless rip-off that (illegally?) uses the same name. What a horrid movie. Even horror movie buffs...BEWARE! Run away. As fast as you can. NOW! RUN! UGH!!!!!
1,Awful Awful Awful,"I absolutely hated this piece of trash!!! I only watched a little of it,thats how bad it was!!!"
1,Worst movie Hollywood has released,"I cannot believe ANYONE would waste money concocting this really awful movie. If it cost more than 50 cents to make, then that was too much.The Black Dahlia case is one of the more mysterious, unsolved cases in america.... and a very intriguing one at that.I haven't see DePalma's new version yet. However, the best version I have viewed so far was the one with Lucie Arnaz. Hard to find, made for TV, but a good one.Don't waste even one minute of your time on this one. If I could, I would have given it '0' stars."
1,Truly Awful,"I am very easily entertained and can find something good to say about most movies. This movie however, could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. In all fairess, I couldn't make it through the whole thing as it was just too terrible. I could have made a better movie on my camcorder. Please trust the reviewers on this one and stay away! I wish I would have."
1,is this really directed by ulli lommel?,There was a fine actor/director who worked with the late greatRainer Werner Fassbinder by the name of ulli lommel - could this trulybe the same man who directed this piece of trash? If so i hope it was just for the money - at least i could understand that..this is even bad by horror movie standards.. I know the man who starred in 'love is colder than death' is capable of more than this (if it is the same person).
1,Why made movie as rubbish as this???,"I just bought this DVD and watched it tonight.Oh God, this is again one of the most rubbish movie I have ever seen!!!I am still wondering if it is really a movie or someone is joking, wasting negatives just to make fools out of viewers like us by this experimental garbage...There is nothing in this garbage movie, silly, pointless, senseless, confusing, especially the shots they used make you dizzy.The movie is hard-selling nothing but blood and body-parts in a meaningless way, I seldom use the ""hate"" word, but I hate this movie.Please note that I actually wanted to give ""0"" star but since there is no such option.We are being tortured and ripped of money above all!!!STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Second worst movie in the world,"After this director's other flop, BTK Killer. The videography is terrible, the acting is amateurish, the directing is sloppy, and all in all the only good thing about it was the graphics on the DVD box. If I had remembered that this was the same director who did BTK Killer, I would have known to avoid this movie. Do yourself a favor and avoid all of Ulli Lommel's films."
2,True Blort,"The main thing I didn't like about this movie is that it looked like it was mostly videotaped, NOT filmed...that's an immediate turn-off for me. But I found myself sitting thru the whole thing, waiting to see what was gonna happen. Would you like to know? Why not.....Young girls arrive at an old abandoned building, expecting to audition for a movie adaptation of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder. They're all pretty stupid, because they all allow themselves to be strapped down and cut to pieces by two rednecks with implements of destruction. The whole scene is instigated and witnessed by these two hicks' sister, who stands there giggling like some moronic ninny.I will say this: I gave it an extra star because I didn't expect the ending...that's it's saving grace.....disgusting, but at least it didn't end the way I figured it would.All in all, yeah it's pretty lame, but I sat thru it anyway. You might too, if you have the curiosity of a cat."
4,"Horrible, but not to me.","I recently watched this movie with a friend feeling in a funny mood. Pretty much as soon as it started we cracked up and pretty much didn't stop laughing until the end of the credits (we laughed at the 9 crew members). To somone looking to see this movie because they really want to see a good movie, DO NOT SEE THIS. But if your tacky and wierd you will want to get this."
5,Mobile Cities - A Great Way to Go On Vacation,"For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what year it was supposed to be. Somewhere around the Year 5000. Way back in the 21st or 22nd Century, we had pretty much annihilated ourselves in the 60 Second War. Some centuries later, the technologically challenged offspring survivors have managed to mobilize their cities, thank Quirke (humankind's savior).There's an orphan boy who idolizes the swashbuckling Valentine, there's an orphan girl disfigured by said Valentine, and there's a lot of big mobile cities gobbling up smaller mobile cities for their resources (Municiple Darwinism).The books are a bit dark, kind of like Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. I'd recommend them for anyone 12 and up. There's a bit too much violence for the younger set."
1,Typical straight-to-video bad movie,"The story meanders way too much, the plot is put together in a way very unconducive to a coherent structure, things happen that make no sense and contribute nothing to the main story, cliches abound, and I wasn't sure at what resolution Richard Grieco's character had arrived by the end in the US version. Was he going to leave the priesthood to pursue a relationship with the art student? Maybe I would have been more entertained had I seen the European version to which the other reviewers alluded. Otherwise, this was just another straight-to-video time waster. Who writes these scripts, anyway?!"
3,Not as good as PSP version,"I bought this game, as I've played it before, on the PSP. Unfortunately it is not as good as the PSP version, and it's design is cheesier."
3,Not as good as past iterations of the game,"I have loved Bust A Move since I first played the Neo-Geo version in an arcade some 15 years ago. I have played various home versions of it, from the stellar (Dreamcast) to the pretty good (Gamecube). The DS version, which uses the touch screen to fire your little ball, slingshot-style, is a fun and innovative addition to this classic game, but it doesn't allow for as much precision. Perhaps I am not as hand-eye coordinated as I once was, but this version is slightly more difficult to aim accurately, and therefore slightly less fun as a result.Make no mistake, though. If you have never played Bust-A-Move before, you will love this game, as it is fun and highly addictive in the way that only the best puzzle games are. But if you already own a console version of the game, you may want to try this handheld version before you decide to buy it."
2,Not recommended.,"For the most part, the stories in this collection are mediocre. One notable exception is ""Who Hears the Fish Cry?"", which is excellent. (That's why I gave this collection two stars and not one.)Either you'll like or dislike the stories here. Be prepared to read about sex between all genders: girls and boys, boys and boys, girls and girls. Quite a bit of that in a book that is supposedly for young adults. It's not everyone's taste, and definitely not mine."
2,7 disk series converted into a movie.,"Just watch the series. This is a waste of time. As a movie it will seem disjointed and possibly confusing.The reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that there things out there like the GITS Individual Eleven and other disks which just take footage you already own and try to sell it to you again. This has some new stuff and so gets 1 extra star.The streaming quality seems fine, for those streaming through prime."
2,Very Good,"Rahxephon is a very good show, It has just about anything you would want in a show, Action and sadness and most of all a boy and girl fighting all ods for a life where there Love for one another can come true. It is to me a Really Must See Show, But if I was you I would just get the Series not the Move, The movie is just made up of parts of the Series and nothing new. If you get the Series don't bother with this movie."
5,FYI DVD SPECS,"The Story: (Specs Below)Return to the world of RahXephon, where humans and Mu fight for dominance over a shattered Earth, and giant statues are the ultimate weapons. Where music forms the fabric of the universe and the link between two hearts is the thread upon which the fate of humanity hangs. It is still a love story, but it is not the same story. Not exactly. Prepare for new visions and new revelations, as the other side of RahXephon is finally revealed.Contains a 120-minute feature in both English 5.1 and Japanese 5.1 language versions with English subtitles. Extras includes an 10-page RahXephon booklet and ADV previews.I recommend the Collector's Edition, If you did not buy the box that came with volume 1!"
3,Beware: A mashup of the TV Series,Beware if you were to watch this movie before watching the TV series you will find the story to be very confusing with no plot! The movie has basically taken clips of the TV series and assembled it in to a 1 hour 55 minute movie with some extra scenes. I was fortunate to watch the entire TV series before seeing the movie. There are some things explained in the movie that are not explained in the TV series so it has helped seeing both. This isn't the best anime series/movie that I've ever seen but it wasn't entirely bad. I highly suggest watching the TV series first before seeing the movie and it will make more sense.
2,What are you watching?,"this animation is not as real, it seem to lack some excitement and it was not very interesting, don't buy it."
1,Didn't work,I tried this product and couldn't get it to work. I put the product into my DVD player and went by the instructions and couldn't get it to work.
2,"clock yes, radio no","I bought this clock radio for the size. I knew it had a small speaker, but I only wanted it for the AM news, so I didn't think that mattered. What does matter is that the radio tuner is impossible to set. Even a strong station is hard to locate. The clock by itself is clear and easy to use."
3,"Great business advice, but...","This book contains probably the most valuable business advice I've ever heard in my whole life. You follow and practice what is written here and your career could soar. That being said, I don't recommend you use all the techniques as described by the author during an interview to get a job. You'll sound arrogant and selfish. Few companies are looking for professionals with those traits. Again, don't use it to practice for interviews, unless you find another way to convey the same message without using the author's words, but use it to learn how to become a great business person."
1,One counterproductive audiobook,"This book consisted of two things:1. Obvious advice that you already know, expressed in quite a condescending tone: take responsibility when you do something wrong and make it right, don't be a slacker, etc.2. Advice that might have made sense in the 1950s, but that will cripple your career if you follow it in this century. The author imagines a cozy, predictable, unchanging business world that yields success to rigid, top-down, head-in-the-sand, command-and-control organizations, and to workers who model themselves as square cogs in square wheels, closing themselves off to innovation and to communication, thought and life beyond their own departments and corporations. These attitudes are not what winning firms want in their new hires."
1,Master of the Obvious,"This book is great for someone who has never been in the work force or has never had any work ethic before. Basically the clueless. Clearly not for someone who has worked more than 5 years.This book is merely a list of traits an ideal employee should have. I kept waiting for the meat. This book is completely unhelpful in these economic times because savvy candidates (particularly those who were successful before and but for the economic downturn) know to say these things already and perspective employers know it.That being said, I would recommend for my children to hear this in high school and then again upon graduating from college. BTW I think my view explains why the Amazon reviewer Thomas Carlyle (England) at age 22 and his brother who just graduated from college gave this book 5 stars.Save your money (particularly if you are unemployed)."
1,Old School,"I listened to this audio book in preparation for an interview. It came across as very old school. Basically do whatever you can to suck up to your boss, the boss is of supreme importance, believe this and you will make it to the corner office. I found the material that was valid to be poorly conveyed. Instead of this recording helping me prepare for my interview I found myself incredulously amused at its content."
5,This book makes you believe in yourself,"I listened to ""25"" a few times, then met Dexter Hawk couple weeks ago, at a book signing in Silicon Valley. Go see him, when you get a chance.He makes you believe you can land any job you want. He gives you confidence. And he makes you believe in yourself."
1,The absolute worst material on job interviews I've ever come across.,"I can't imagine anyone being taking seriously in a job interview if they were to actually apply the advice outlined in this material. I'm not totally convinced this isn't a parody of a job interview guide to perfectly honest. If they repackaged it under ""how to be a mindless `yes-man' and corporate rear-kisser in 25 easy steps"" any put some fun, silly fonts on the cover, it'd probably be a better seller."
1,19-th century advice in a brainwashing tone,"Worthless. Instead of talking about intervewier's psychology, tricks, mistakes, common techniques and questions and giving idea of how to better behave on an interview this book goes on an on about ""I love the job! I get things done! I take responsibility!"" Such obvious things repeated over and over in imperative, brainwashing tone sound irritating. The book also goes out of its own scope and talks too much about how to change, tweak (or freak, if you like) your personality to achieve some career advancements. This is completely irrelevant to the subject. For professional jobs nowadays it is often the company who is more interested in you, not vice-versa, therefore staying with your interests and personality is very important."
1,worthless advice,This book is not worth the weight of tape it was recorded on.The advices are outdated. They might help you get your first job after high school but won't move you to the next level.
1,How can this possibly help prepare for an interview?,"Wow, what a misnomer. If you ""said"" these things in an interview, I think the interview would end pretty fast. Does Dexter Hawk really think it is compelling for an interviewee to say, ""I work hard, I show up early, etc?"" This is perhaps for part time teenage year job interviews."
3,good overall review of the panzer'movements in WWII,"This book gives the good explanation of development, utilization and fate of German armors in WWII in each campaign in an easy-to-read way. After completed this book, you will get the more clearer view of the panzer force. The pictures are clear and many of them seem to be seen here for the first time. The one disappointed thing is the rather large amounts of wrong identification of the types of AFVs and weapons in the pictures. The quality of printing and binding are of high standard."
2,WARNING:THIS IS NOT BY LOVECRAFT,"This book is actually written by August Derleth, after HPL's death, supposedly off of notes Lovecraft had sitting around. It's the best Derleth I've read, meaning you can actually slog through it without vomiting if you really try. Spend your $... on something useful, like a bottle of vitamins. They'll be more entertaining."
1,"see ""inept,"" above.","Mostly written by Auggie, and representing a dramatic departure from Lovecraft's cosmology. Bad prose, characterization, development, etc. Buy ANYTHING else by Lovecraft before this, preferably from Arkham house."
2,OH GOD IT HURTS,"Wow, I never knew books could just drone on and on like this on did. The only reason i gave this book two stars instead of one is because it has it's interesting points. The last half of the last section of the book comes to mind. But other then that this book is not worth the paper it was printed on. This is the first ""Lovecraft"" book I've read and am far from impressed. At times i actually found myself dozing off while reading this book. Now I'm about eightteen pages from the end, and decided to save them for before I go to bed, for sure, it will put me to sleep. Avoid this book, at all cost. Read and actual Lovecraft book, I hear those are pretty good."
2,One of DERLETH'S better books.,"This is one of Derleth's (in)famous ""posthomous collaborations"" with HPL, where he took a few scraps HPL did and slotted them into his own story.Sadly, Mr Derleth's Mythos stories (both the posthomous collaborations and the stuff he took all the credit for) tend to all have the same plot: some guy moves into an ancestor's house, it turns out that the ancestor was an evil cultist, the guy repeats his ancestor's Cthulhu-worship. Yawn. Lovecraft did it once, and did it better, in ""The Rats in the Walls"".Fortunately, Derleth pulls of the repeated plot a lot better here than he did elsewhere."
1,Don't make the same mistake I did!,"I purchased this book under the pretense that it was written by Lovecraft. After hearing so much praise about HPL, I couldn't wait to start reading it. After the first few chapters, it became a chore to read. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It was like eating a bowl of tofu when you expected Captain Crunch. When I finished it I was convinced all the hype about HPL was blown out of proportion and that he was nothing more than a less than mediocre author. Little did I know he didn't even write it! It took me over 3 years to find this out. When I finally did get my hands on an authentic Lovecraft book I was floored by the way he drew me right into the story-the dark and shadowy world of Innsmouth. Don't buy ""The Lurker at the Threshhold"". Save your time and money and be sure to check the copywrite before you buy any Lovecraft book(Derleth is sneaky)."
1,A big build up to an anti-climatic ending,"Still having the ending fresh in my mind, I must say that it would be hard to write a more disappointing ending except by just failing to write one altogether. The story was all building up to one epic ending, and instead of a satisfactory delivery it feels like a fizzling white-wash that leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a desire to smack the author.Get anything else by Lovecraft. This isn't entirely written by him, but also August Derleth who must have concocted that awful ending."
3,"Good story, well done","It's a good read. It's not an action-packed, thrill-a-minute magnum opus, as it seems some wish it wouldve been. It's a rich, Gothic story... not trendy modern neo-Gothic. There is a vast distinction.It has a good pace. It's nicely done. It's enjoyable."
3,A Fair Book -- But Who's the Author?,"This is a fairly good novel and one of the betterMythos works August Derleth ever wrote. Yes, I said AugustDerleth. H. P. Lovecraft is given credit on the cover,but he only supplies two short fragments that are abouta page's worth of material each and were probably notintended to go together. The rest is entirelyAugust Derleth's work. In all fairness, this is Carrolland Graf's problem, not Amazon Book's."
1,doesn't work with SMTP authentication,"This idea a real killer...but the UX-B800SE is a partial failure.Purchased one but returned it the 2nd day.If your internet/email provider needs the SMTP authentication before sending out email, such as AT&T; Yahoo!DSL and many of the major email service providers, you are stuck, period. There's no workaround."
1,This is Refurbished with Missing Parts. Do Not Order!!!,"This is a Refurbished Product (not NEW as it says). I ordered it and received it today (after 9 days); however on the box it printed Refurbished Product. Opened the Box, it had a paper inside which states that you have purchased a refurbished product. Anyways since I had opened it I started putting it together and found that Ink Cartridge was missing (Read the User Manual, they have stamped with RED - Ink Cartridge Not Included). Furthermore, Warranty Card has another Mark ""VOID"". It will not work without Ink cartridge. Price for Sharp Cartridge varies from $35 to $100 on Amazon (not sure if it will even work).Do NOT ORDER this machine. It is not what it says!!!I have not powered it on yet; don't know if it even works."
4,Broadband fax,"Switched to a VOIP provider, after they assured me that my fax would work--it didn't. Saw this broadband fax-perfect. I've spoken to people whose regular fax works over the internet-others whose fax machines don't.This Sharp Broadband fax works flawlessly with Optimum Voice.Cablevision sales dept. just lied. Do a google search before you switch to VOIP-many people have fax issues."
1,Don't even think about this machine if you really want the broadband features.,"Listen to the other reviews: OK as a basic, stand-alone fax, but the broadband function only works for ISPs that don't require POP authentication. It will not work in most places and more and more ISPs are switching, so chances are if it works now, it may not soon."
2,THIS IS A REFURBISHED AND DOES NOT COME WITH CARTRIDGE,"This is a real low. The ad clearly identifies a new fax machine and this is not. Although some of the other sellers do sell the refurbished, I clicked on this ad because it stated new. Well, the cartridge they are stating COST MORE THAN THE FAX MACHINE!! So, in the end this machine will cost you double the price they are quoting. Most new machines will have some sort of cartridge in them, but this has none.A slip of paper in the package states this:""This Package contains a refurbished facsimile. These models require an Imaging Cartridge to print, As a refurbished product this cartridge is not included and must be purchased separately.""What kind of false advertising scheme is this company trying to pull?The actual machine I received looks good and so far everything seems to be fine, but instead of ordering the cartridge, I will use the broadband function to send the faxes to my computer for printing. What a real disappointment this is."
4,The Only Fax to Email Machine,"I brough 13 RB condition from them, $36 each and 2 have issue. Follow the RMA procedure and got the repalcement back in 3 weeks. You don't need to connect it to PC or any other system (but internet), and you can have all incoming fax to your email account. The only missing function is it cannot email you the out going fax confirmation and you need to print it out, otherwise, you don't need to replace the ink (very expensive $38/each) and don't need to feed the paper."
1,Main Feature Impossible to Setup. Don't bother.,"Works decently as a simple fax machine, but the main feature of fax over email is impossible to setup. After 5 days of troubleshooting, calls to Sharp and trying different setups nothing worked.This is not a sellers fault, who shipped the product very quickly, just a crappy product from Sharp."
1,Don't bother - get a Brother,This fax machine is terribly complicated...has a hard time finding an IP address (internet address) and jams constantly. I think that Sharp just wasn't paying attention when they manufactured this fax machine. It sounds like a great deal being able to fax to an email address...but read the fine print. It's difficult to use...will cancel your faxes on a whim by resetting randomly. Maybe I got a lemon...or maybe not...but I'd think twice before buying this fax machine.
5,very nice,Very good deal. Great price and very good working fax machine. came to my house very fast and in great shape
3,"Was a pain, now it's fine","I've had this product for almost 2 years and had to have an account with smtp2go but no longer! Cox finally works without hassle. [...] and port 25... that's it! I can't speak for the other functions (print and fax)... All I do is scan to emails... and it works flawlessly. Wish I didn't have to go through all the anguish at first, but I'm good now!!!!"
4,Christie Excels With Story of International Intrigue,"Hilary Craven, the heroine of this story, wishes to commit suicide. The sleeping pills are on her bedside table and all is ready for self-imposed death when a knock on the door changes her plans. A young man tells her the story of a nuclear physicist who has disappeared. Hilary, intrigued by the drama, agrees to impersonate the scientist's wife and begins an improbable masquerade that leads her deep into Africa to an unknown destination.This is a book you will probably want to read in one sitting because of its breathless excitement which culminates in a surprising ending."
1,"Usually a fan, but unimpressed","Let me start by saying I love Agathie Christie, she's one of my guilty pleasures. There's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it's raining outside.That being said, this novel is very odd and uninspiring. It's not one of her typical murder mysteries...and it's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel'. This probably would have made a fine screenplay...but there's not enough coherence or guts to it, to make it a good novel as such. The characters also, are rather forgettable. The climax to the novel as well, is all rather odd and unimpressive.A fast read notheless."
5,"NOW, WHAT WAS I READING?","Too bad you can't give a book 0 stars, I would if I could. I read this book and found it SO boring (this might be because I read it when I was 10). I couldn't remember what I had read at the top of the page before I go to the bottom! This just proves how boring it was. And believe me, I was reading other mysteries at the time so I know a good one when I see it. Agatha Christie was NOT a good one."
4,More Thriller than the other mysteries,"Most of Agatha Christie novels are murder mysteries. They follow the usual murder mystery formula. Someone is murdered. Enter the detective who must solve the mystery before the murderer strikes again.Destination Unknown is different. It is more of a thriller than a mystery. There are deaths, but it is different. And in a total good way. This was a nice break from the murder mysteries and kept me reading until the last paragraph.Definitely recommend it for all Agatha Christie fans."
5,VERY INTERESTING,"It's nice to take a break from Poirot and Marple. Usually, when Christie gets away from her usual detectives, you get a story that has plenty of adventure and a much more interesting story. A harried detective sends a girl ready to commit suicide on on a hunt for some murderers...dressed up like a dead woman. Needless to say, your heart is racing thru-out the whole thing. Buy it, especially if you feel bored or rather depressed yourself!"
1,"Shame on you, Princeton!","I was quite excited to see this book & read the comments. Princeton University Press doesn't publish much classics, and I had high hopes for this volume. When it arrived, I was upset to learn that it was a Bollingen imprint -- Jungian propaganda, with a lot of imagination, outdated scholarship and contempt for scholarly values. It really is despicable of Princeton to tarnish their reputation with their Bollingen imprint, and I feel like a sucker to have wasted my money on such a preposterously worthless book, and I wish that Amazon.com would put a warning label on the Bollingen imprints, so clearthinking people can be more careful when ordering. (The problem is, of course, that few excellent books are mixed in with the nonsense, so one can't dismiss Bollingen books out of hand, but there is usually a 90% chance that they are garbage.)"
2,"Disappointing - Not complex, not authentic","I was really disappointed when I received my tin of raz el hanout from Blessac. I don't know what to make of the earlier 5 star reviews. Perhaps Blessac has changed its supplier or its recipe. There are only 7 ingredients in this mix - turmeric, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, pepper, clove and chili. It smells and tastes more like Indian curry powder than ras el hanout. For me, this purchase was a waste of money."
4,Alice in Blunderland,"Alice in Bluderland by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is a marvelous book about a girl named Alice that lives with her brother and father. She doesn't have a mom because her mom died when she was a little girl. Imagine how it would feel like to live without a mom! This book made me want to read more and more. If you think this book sounds boring, you are totally wrong! If you want to know more about the book you have to read it yourself. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
4,An Unusual Historical Novel,"""Helena"" is not a typical historical novel--it is too self-conscious in its purpose, and Waugh fills the dialogue with Britishisms (""What a lark!"" and ""dearest Mummy""). It does, however, contain a subtle and emotional portrayal of how Helena, mother of Constantine, finds Christianity and the true cross. This is not a novel that will make you feel as if you are experiencing the time period, but it may speak to your emotions, despite its rather contrived form."
4,An oddity for Waugh -- but well worth reading,This is an oddity for Waugh -- but well worth reading.I was impressed by his historical research to begin with. The author admits where he filled gaps in the known facts with his own inventions. It has all the mastery of writing that Waugh was known for and is full of wit but not the biting sarcastic wit of much of Waugh. Altogether it's a heartfelt and gripping read.
5,Outstanding book.,I'll keep it short and sweet. This is possibly the best WW2 photo book out there. Amazing photos of both the Leibstandarte and Totenkopf during the Battle of Kharkov. I appreciate this book more and more as time passes. I strongly recommend this book.
2,Photografhic book,"A photographical book really well done. If you read it side by side with an historical book about the third battle fo Karkov, like the one from the french Heimdal, you'll be able to capture the real flavour of the battle understanding the nature of the battlefields and of the firezones, the problems and the solutions, the real availability of tanks, SP guns and artillery of the best supplied german SS tank division and imagine how bad was the To&E of the others. If you like the russo german war during the WWII, you'll appreciate this book."
5,Awesome,"This cd is really awesome. I've never heard two people play more together and sound more like one instrument then the Duo Patterson. They have such a unique and beautiful blend, on top of being so precise techically that it's nothing but a joy to listen to them. I truly recommend this cd to anyone!"
3,Doesn't really work well with Excel,"I bought this so I'd be able to open Excel documents that I receive in email, as well as for Word. While I'm reasonably pleased with the Word functionality, potential buyers should know that the spreadsheet program is NOT Excel or even Excel lite, and is not fully compatible with .xls documents. I find this very irritating."
1,Depends on how interested you are in the Word program,"I bought this because I needed a new copy of Word. Since Word is always bundled with other programs I chose this one for the price. However, I did not know there would not be a Word 2006 in the pkg. I later learned that Word did not have a new and improved version in 2006. However, this version was Word 2002! What a drag! It is older than the version I had on my system which had become defective. Now I need to buy another version."
4,Works Suite,"The product works very good, Microsoft should make their operating systems work as well as this product."
2,I expected a lot but this tool doesn't deliver,"The Zipsaw is a great idea. Unfortunately, this tool is under powered and struggles to complete most medium duty tasks. I found the Zipsaw useful for hobby projects like cutting balsa wood, cardboard light guage plastic etc.My other two problems with this tool are no.1 it is way too loud and no.2 it gets too hot during use.Clever idea but disapointing quality and performance."
1,Coughed up an internal part,"I received the HS600 for a gift. Loved the case, etc. Used it about twice before it dislodged and internal part that pretty much chewed up the internals. Thought about getting parts and fixing it but after reading the other reviews...maybe not."
3,Good movie....with other influences...,"While it is a cycling movie...there is a strong spritial part to this, not bad, just did not expect it."
5,hair gel,Showed up on time. It was packaged well. Very happy to find it at a reasonable price. However very sad that they are not going to make it any more.
3,good songs ...,"...but if you enjoyed most of the music in this movie, you should probably just buy a Spoon cd, since almost all of the songs and instrumentals in the film itself are Spoon songs.All of their albums are good, but you should probably start with Kill the Moonlight."
4,Stranger than Fiction,"Stranger than Fiction is a terrific film, although a bit 'close to home' if you are an obsessive compulsive. The music is a complementary score that works well."
2,Disappointed,"I watched the movie and liked the song ""whole wide world"". Purchased the CD. But, very disappointed by the song. The original singer's voice sounded child-like. I think Farrell did a better job of singing than the original artist. :(."
3,Interesting,"If viewers have watched Schultze Gets the Blue, you have an idea of what to expect for this offering. The main character leads a repetitive life day in and day out akin to Groundhogs Day until one day, he decides to go away to have a perspective of what life truly means. He comes across interesting characters along his journey and befriends some of them that enrich his life. A movie more about observation of human's behaviour. Commendable catching."
5,James Robinson and Tony Harris are Brilliant!,"This excellent reprinted trade of issues 0-5 of the rgular Starman series, perfectly sums up everything that should be good in comics.The art is tragic in a way, yet absolutely spectacular. And the writing and character information is absolutely the best I have ever seen in a comic.Do yourself a favor and get this book!"
5,Starman!,"Starman, written by James Robinson,with art by Tony Harris, Peter Snejbjerg and others, details the exploits of Jack Knight, the son of the aging 1940's Starman, as he struggles with the family business, his personal business and Knight's Past, his, um, business business. It's got science, mystery, romance, cowboys, pirates, and some of the most pure heroism that was presented in the grim and shallow world of 1990's comics. This is one of those great series, Sandman-style, which is loved by comic and non-comic readers alike. This is where I first saw the pencils of Ex Machina artist Tony Harris. I had such a man crush on this creative team, when I met them at a convention in 1996 I giggled Japanese schoolgirl style and averted my eyes. I palpitate at the thought! James Robinson complimented me on my shirt, which I had cleaned especially for the occasion. This is the comic that made me love DC comics, made me embrace my inner collector, and kept me returning to the comic store."
2,Too small,"This product is too small to really be able to shake up 5 dice. May be because I am used to larger, thicker leather tooled cups from Mexico that stand up to the fun of the game."
4,Ambience Primrose Shimmer Serum,"I have been using this product for a few months now. I have had mixed feelings on the the product, especially after seeing alcohol as the first ingredient. I don't know about the previous review, but it does smell like alcohol. Having stated that I would like to say that the product does dry to a smooth finish quickly. I also believe this has helped keep my acne prone skin to a minimum (in my mid 40's) without overly drying it out. (and yes I at times have VERY dry skin-esp. in winter). I apply this after cleansing and toning and before using a moisurizer.Ambience Shimmer SerumI would recommend this product to others on this basis. It may not be the best product out there but the benefits I have personally received have made it worth it. It also lasts a while unlike many other serums."
3,Not Bad,"Got this product for my son for Christmas. Overall works well,and has a very large clock face. We were only able to tune in a few stations,but the ones that did come in had a pretty strong signal.We would recommend this clock ."
2,Average Product Bad Reception,"Looks good for a cheap radio. Strog Built doesn't sound bad.But you can only get one or two stations outdoors or in a big room in the house, don't take in to a small room or office because you wont get anything.I wont recomended, for that money you can get something wiht better reception."
5,The best I've seen,"Highly recommended - This is still the best intro book I've seen on PKI. Precisely and clearly written. Can't wait for the second edition, though, as this edition is getting a bit dated."
2,Not even close to the size,"I grow nothing but dinner plate dahlias. These did not get to the expected size. Others in the garden did. I water, feed and stake."
2,"Loved the first 2, but disappointed now","The first 2 books were great! I couldn't wait for Milk Glass.Maybe my expectations were too high. There wasn't much of a story line in this one. It was just day to day. No big news or anything to keep the pages turning. It was still a pleasant read, and easy to follow but it just lacked the impact of the other 2 books. I'm still a fan and can't wait for Trigiani's next."
3,Trigiani gets her groove back after Big Cherry Holler,"This is the third and final (?) installment in Trigiani's series about the people of Big Stone Gap and the MacChesney family. The second book was an unrealistic portrayal of life after the death of a child, but in this third book, Trigiani really hits home with her central theme of mother/daughter conflict during the teenage years. She knows her stuff and paints a compelling portrait of a family adjusting to the fact that their little girl is growing up.This book ends with all the characters having completed 180 degree turns on their lives. Will this be the last we hear from the residents of Big Stone Gap?"
5,Book Review,Great book! Author is awesome. First time reading her books & really enjoyed the triology.
2,While I didn't completely hate it,"it didn't have that special something that Big Stone Gap did. I loved Big Stone Gap, liked Big Cherry Holler, but there was something missing in this one. There is nothing new or exciting here. New characters are introduced then not truly developed, the old ones don't get nearly as much attention. I just don't understand why Ave Maria doesn't make her break out of Stone Gap when she has the most stimulating conversation with Theodore than she's had for months at home and still feels like such an outsider. Surely a pharmacist could find work anywhere she would choose to. We are all set up to see Ave Maria and Jack Mac again, next time in Italy. Hopefully Adrianna Trigiani will be able to recapture the original magic of the first book again."
1,Disappointed,"I've read the first two in the series. This book was a disappointment. There just wasn't much of a story ----- just a narrative without any real plot.I don't think I'll read the 4th in the series, after having to plod through this one."
1,Trite and full of cliches,"I was disappointed by this book, the first (and last) one I have read by this author. As another reviewer said, there is little to no character development. The protagonist comes off as a shallow whiner who thinks her moronic pithy sayings pass for philosophy. I only finished the book because I paid too much for it On Kindle. I have a hard time knowing how books are priced on Amazon: too often I don't feel I get what I paid for. And then again, I have totally enjoyed older classics and books priced at less than a dollar!Anyway, it's unbelievable that this book got so many 4 and 5 star reviews? Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Going out with a thump,"I loved Big Stone Gap so much that when Big Cherry Holler came out I grab it without hesitation and enjoyed reading about the evolution of all the realtionships that I came to love in the first novel. BUT Milk Glass Moon is soooo boring I can barely keep my motivation to read it through to the end. Ave Maria is so annoying and still has all the same insecurities as the first novel. I thought that she resolved alot of her insecurities in Big Cherry Holler. Poor Jack Mac and Etta, they have to live with her. There were so many opportunities to turn this book around. With a focus on Jack or Etta and how they have dealt with living in the Gap, the loss of Joe or just living with Ave.Sorry to say, but I just can't recommend this book to anyone. The first and second novels were such hits but this one is such a miss. Please Ms. Trigianni end the series here before I forget why I loved your writing in the first place."
5,Welcome back friends,In this long awaited conclusion to the Big Stone Gap trilogy you will once again meet up with all your friends. The story opens with Etta at the difficult age of 13 and ends with her being a young woman of 18. Will Ave Marie be able to survive her daughter growing up? You will have to be sure to read this one because there are alot of surprises for you just around the bend.Milk Glass Moon is a wonderful cozy read that you should not pass up on.
2,Disappointed,I really enjoyed the 1st 2 books but found that I had to force myself to finish this one. I was disappointed that it didn't hold my attention and that there wasn't mush going on in this book worth reading.
2,Very Disappointing,"I had been looking forward to this book for so long, having enjoyed the first two very much. What a disappointment. It took a lot of effort to keep reading to the end. It was one cliched situation after another, there was no real story going on, and all of the characters (whom I once loved) were just plain annoying. I don't know what happened with the author this time. It's like she figured the characters were just so endearing that anything they could do or say would be loved by the reader. If you decide to read this book, go into it with low expectations. Then maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised!"
2,Milk Glass Moon,"The author is becoming the ""same old same old""...nothing beats her first novel or Valentine."
3,A decent read,"It's been a few years since I read the first two books in this series. However, I had high hopes for this one. I found myself quickly becoming bored with the characters. I skimmed several pages toward the end just to finish the book. I also felt this book was rushed. Trigiani takes us from her daughter being 11 to 13, then it seems as though she rushes us through the book to marry off the daughter. Ave seems to continually choose the ""safe"" option, which was boring. This was not what I expected. A decent read, but not as exciting as the first two books."
3,Good but Rushed .....,"I have to say that I had high hopes for Milk Glass Moon. I was hoping the trilogy would go out with a *bang*. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed in this one. The first half of the book was pretty slow moving for me and it lacked the *country feel* that the first Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Hollar had. I felt that towards the end of the book the story was rushed.All in all, it was an easy read but it just didn't live up to the standards of the first two."
1,Disappointing,"Ah, five scenes and none of them are anything like the pictures on the front, sides, or back of the video box. Instead we get the following scenes. First, Betty gyrating in a living room -- no bondage here that I could see. Second, she puts on very high heels which could be seen as bondage in some form. Third she is kidnapped by a rather silly pair of women. Third she is taken by a woman and complies with being tied up in a pseudo-suspension fashion -- the look on Betty's face is amusing. Fourth, she and another woman kidnap a third, dump her in the back of a car then go no where but the backyard to try and tie her up. Fifth she disciplines another woman. The spanking is silly, the bondage is foolish, and it was very disappointing to never see Betty as the whip-welding dom on the cover of the box. I guess for the 1950s this was hot stuff -- just not today."
2,Too Much $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,"Though a useful tool, for what it is and does...... WOW!! $440.00!!Just imagine, a small piece of chain linked fence with some directional tines on it. What a concept!"
4,Guitar Hero,I got it for my son for Christmas and he has been playing it constantly since.It was in good shape and the disc was in good shape. It did meet my expectations except there was no owners manual and I couldn't find one online.
4,So much fun!,"My husband and I purchased this as a birthday gift for our 11 year old daughter, but it turns out I'm enjoying as well! I've played it more than she has so far! It is a lot of fun, but I noticed that it occassionally misses some button pushes. Not a big deal though. We are still having a great time!"
3,tom foolery,I THOUGHT I GOT A GOOD DEAL BIT THE GUITAR WAS CHEWED ON AND NOT THE ONED IN THE PICTURE..AT LEAST TELL REAL CONDITION OF MERC.
5,This is sooooo much fun!!!,"I got this for my kids for christmas, but my husband and I play it just as much......great family time!"
4,Easy to pick up,"Easy to pick up and play and quite addictive, gets a little hard as you progress through the game but overall a +"
5,I thought this would be a lot of fun..,"And its even more fun than I thought! My wife got this for me for my birthday, and the entire family is playing it over Christmas break! From me and my wife, my college boys to my 9 year old. This is a great family gift and more fun that I could have thought."
2,"Game is fun, but guitar is horrible","There are some really fun songs on this installment of the ""Guitar Hero"" series, but you're better off just buying the stand-alone game instead of the bundle, because the guitar that comes with this is a piece of junk. Unless you're pointing the neck down toward the ground, be prepared for unexpected star power launches. Also, when you're holding down long notes, don't be surprised if they suddenly aren't being held down anymore. And when you write to customer service about the worst gamer guitar you've ever played (and I've got five others), be prepared for them to ignore you. It wouldn't be so bad if they would at least release a downloadable update to make this game compatible with the ""Rock Band"" guitars (like there is with ""World Tour"" and ""GH: Aerosmith""), which are much better controllers than this."
4,Guitar Hero III Rocks,"Guitar Hero III is amazing, the game already has a great variety of songs on it and then on live there is even a better selection."
4,Awesome game!,"This is an awesome game. Great songs, great difficulty, great guitar! Also, I think that the game HUD can show the stars I have in real time, and a few things in the menus, but you forget about that once you start playing.The box came in excellent condition, and the batteries last a lot. I lost the count of hours, but I passed the game in medium and easy difficulty with the same batteries, and my brother also is playing it in hard. Until here, batteries are just beginning to look empty."
5,Solid,"What's there to say. Either you like this sort of rhythm game/rock fantasy or not. GH delivers for anyone who's longed to take their air guitar to the next level... and also helpful for those like me with a particular deficiency in the ""rhythm"" department."
4,Great game but a little easy.,"This game is really fun but with some songs i don't recognize. Anyway, it is still a good game but if you don't like a big challenge from guitar hero i don't think you would like this game because the expert mode is extremely well maybe not extremely but pretty easy. Well its a good game and i hope you enjoy."
3,Guitar Hero 3,"Just an overall commercialized version of guitar hero 1, and 2. The game is a bit more challenging, the black guitar is awesome! The boss battles are quite challenging on expert. Over all the game is fun, and the graphics are great, with funny little cut scenes here and there."
4,Music Fun,"I bought this for my family for Christmas and it was a big hit. Even my husband plays it daily. Even though I am not very good at it, we all really enjoy the songs that are used. I ended up buying Guitar Hero: World Tour just so we would have some more variety."
5,OMG Killswitch engage unlockable my curse,"this game is outstanding!!!! has me up all night playing my curse by killswitch engage after unlocking it i cant stop playing it... the boss battles are fun and challenging. slash is a tough one even on medium.the game has changed graphics wise from 2 it doesnt look as cartoony as it did...all in all i had to give this 5 stars for the wide selection of good songs to include some: miss murder by afi, welcome to the jungle by guns and roses, schools out and many more. this game will have you playing the songs in your head all day.. i highly recommend this game for anyone who loved 1 and 2."
2,Low quality hardware ruins this game,"This game could have been awesome for me. The software is really good. BUT, the hardware (guitar) is super low quality. Seriously, it's garbage. The middle button only works intermittently. I will NEVER buy another Red Octane product. I honestly have ZERO respect for them. They develop awesome software for this game and then the hardware is garbage. Seriously, I could build a better guitar. Do yourself a favor and just buy rock band. They have better songs and the gear you get actually works."
4,Party on Wayne!,"I'm not particularly a Rock fan but GH 3 offers some nostalgic tracks that no one can resist! Even my 8 year old nephew who swear Chris Brown is the king of the beat(get it... beat LOL) All jokes aside the game is progressive in a you learn as you go kind of way with easier songs to start and harder ones later on.Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone with an xbox 360."
5,Bought as a gift,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. You can't go wrong with wireless Guitar Hero. Even though he's not a big rock fan, he still loves to play this game. It contains alot of good songs anyone would know."
4,"Good game, great value",For the price this was a great deal. I got the guitar I needed and a good game. I just supplemented with buying some of the newer version of Guitar Hero seperately.
1,"The game is great, but the controller dosn't work","I love the game, but my red button wouldn't work on my first wireless controller which came with the bundle. After a returned it my second controller had issues. The whammy bar was always activated and it is nearly impossible to activate the star power. I need to hold the base of the guitar by the bottom with both hands and whip it around the room to activate the star power. I researched the problem in forums and found out that there are a lot of other people with the same problem. Do NOT buy the bundle. The new controller is horrible it ruins the game. I cannot believe that a company would release such a crappy piece of equipment on the third generation of a franchise. It makes me wonder if they even tested the controller before releasing it. Use your old controller and save yourself fourty bucks."
4,"Wireless controller Great, game mostly fun","I purchased guitar hero III because I really wanted a second controller for rock band, So we could have a full 4 person band. For an extra $20 I could get the bundle that includes guitar hero. My wife worried that the controller might have a delay since it was wireless (and she experienced a similar problem with a wireless DDR pad.) This was not the case, the controller is great some people preferring the button being raised in their guitar (like the guitar hero controller), other friends prefer the flush buttons of the rock band controller, but both work great. Unfortunately Activision has made is so that the rock band controller does not work in guitar hero, so we seldom play guitar hero because we have to play it alone. Guitar Hero has nicer graphics than rock band and a decent song list, but it is a lot more fun to play with other people."
4,"Fun game, but tough","Fans of the Guitar Hero franchise will love this, but it can be difficult at times; even more so than the second one. Plus, as I gamer who prefers not playing with people I don't know, I was disappointed at the number of achievements that can only be obtained through online ranked match play, the most competitive of the online game types. That aside, there are lots of great songs and the hammer on/pull off system is more responsive than previous titles."
4,Still the best music based game around.,"Guitar Hero 3 continues it's excellent game play and fun from previous titles. The guitar is the best one to date. The strum bar and fret buttons area as smooth as silk, really well designed. Plenty of songs for people of all ages. The ability to to download song via XBOX live is great, even if pricing is a little high. This game would have received a 5 out of 5 if not for the in game advertising. For a game that is all about the idea of being a rock star, it feels the game has sold out with all the advertising. Again, that's just a minor grip of mine. Guitar Hero 3 is a great game that will keep you entertained for a long time to come. Highly recommended."
5,guitar hero 3 for xbox 360,Fun for the whole family!! It's addicting. We play on a Sony Bravia HD LCD-the graphics are amazing.
1,Beware - Fake Copy of Book Being Sold,"My book came in today. It has the same cover as the advertised book, but when I opened it, the CONTENTS are another book! The cover is Living White by Robert S. Griffin, but the actual book INSIDE is ""Attracting Abundance with EFT"" by Carol Look!You've been warned. I don't think this was an accident."
3,not great but decent,"Started with 240 wpm on my first test, finished with 320 on my tenth dayNot a great achievement but still counts, I sayNot so much through her speeding technique ( I hardly found anything useful ) but rather through being aware of what reduces my speed and trying to eliminate* daydreaming* sub-vocalization* regressionSimply put -* stay focused ( eliminate distractions, sleep well etc. )* trust your eyes ( stop constantly re-reading )* make sure you understand what you're reading through critical attitudeYour reading speed greatly depends on what sort of a text you're readingThe text about the speed reading history ( in the middle of the book ) I was able to read at whopping 526 wpm, but that was really easy structured, so that visual map is easy to build. The fiction ( day 9) on the other hand was terribly slow (200wpm) and very poor understanding.The book is useful all in all - 3 stars"
4,Interesting approach,"A series of interesting techniques to help improve your reading speed. Not 100% sure that they are all worth while, but there are a couple gems in there."
4,It worked for me,"10 Days to Faster Reading was definitely worthwhile reading. I am not afraid to read and consider myself a quick reader. To my surprise, reading at my normal pace, I was only at 265 WPM. This is quite average. I know that I can read fast when I have to, but I never had any strategies to follow and found myself just thumbing through the pages, retaining no information.10 Days introduced me to multiple methods for reading faster, a few of which seem to work well with me: using a pacer, keywords/key phrases, and previewing. My WPM is now well over 450. And that is after only 10 days, with much improved accuracy.The only drawback to this book is that it provide a large amount of information over a relatively short time frame. I will remember what worked for me right away, but probably will not remember enough to try out some of the other techniques that take longer to learn."
4,Incredible!,"When I first bought this book I wasn't expecting much. It seemed unreasonable that reading speed could be increased greatly in a short period of time. I bought it anyway, however, in hopes that it might have valid suggestions to improve reading speed that I could develop over time.It was a tremedous surprise when I more than TRIPLED my reading speed in just four days! When I began I was a slow to average reader (200 WPM). After four days I was able to read at nearly 650 WPM. However, comprehension is a different story. When I read quickly I find it hard to retain information. The book assures me that with practice I will begin to retain more of what I read. I am finding that this is true.In conclusion, you should be able to learn how to read much faster (not necessarily triple your speed though) in just 10 days. But after learning how to read quickly, it will take a great deal of practice to gain the comprehension you had before."
3,Interesting to start with,"The first few chapters of this book are helpful for improving your reading speed. From there, it turns into a more generalised self help book, addressing issues like how to label your incoming bills to make sure that you pay them on time. Thanks, but I'd rather read David Allen's Getting Things Done if I was looking for a productivity book.Still, I was able to use the speed reading techniques (mainly how to quickly skip through dense content while maintaining some comprehension) to skip through the last six chapters and determine that I wasn't missing anything amazing by not reading them in great depth."
1,10 days to Faster reading,"I would NOT recomend this book. I read it 2 times and I put in practice their suggestions, techniques with nothing to show for."
1,A good book to learn how to skim through documents,"I am reading this book and aside from the hidious reacing car obsession by the author, I found that it has good suggestions for reading faster. However, seeing more words-per-minute does not mean comprehending what you just read! This book could become valuable if it had also information about how to retain information read at high speed. my two cents..."
1,Typos Turn Me Off,"Why would I ever buy a book with a glaring typo in the Table of Contents? She spells ""putting the key in the ignition"" as ""puting the key...""There is obviously poor attention to the editing of the book, which in my mind calls into question the quality of the material."
5,"What to Do If Your Mom Or Dad Says ""Clean up your room""!","I had this book along with others in the ""What To Do"" series when my kids were young in the 1980's. I bought this book for my grand kids because it provides the clearest explaination I have every seen of just exactly how to clean your room. It goes step by step in an amusing way but so clearly that it makes this often daunting task seem do-able. Using this as a bedtime book as well as an ""at the time"" book helps reinforce the steps needed. I would give this book to anyone young or older who is overwhelmed by the process of cleaning their room!"
2,Machiavelli and Music,"This guide seems to be written primarily by Robert Cowden and opens appropriately with a quote from Machiavelli. Examples (both real and fictional), of administrative and evaluative practices from the Department of Music at Indiana State University (Terre Haute, Indiana) are given. An overview of other music department's procedures is lacking."
4,Cute as a button,My flower girl looks so cute in this. The only drawback is we have to have it taken up in the waist even though my flower girl is a little chunky. Just keep in mind that you will more than likely have to alter the dress. The flowers are glued on and I wonder how this is going to hold up. I will probably have the seamstress put some stitches there too.
4,Watch out for the clasp,"We ordered two dresses - one for each daughter. Upon arrival, one of the clasps came unglued with the slightest touch. No biggie; a little hot glue did the trick. One of the other clasps cam undone, so I reglued that one as well. The size runs a bit big at the waistline, like another customer mentioned. All in all, for the workmanship and price, the dress was well worth it!We also purchased the Blue Cinderella Tulle Dress (1098), which held up much better and looks even better than in the picture!The BEST PART about these dresses...they are MADE IN THE U.S.A.!"
4,"Okay, but not great","I really wanted a blue sapphire necklace. Unfortunately, the sapphires look black, even if you hold them up to the light. It is a pretty necklace, so I decided to keep it. Still looking for blue sapphires that are blue in person, not just in the picture."
4,Saddness But Interesting.....,"It wasn't what I expected cause I may not have read the review well I thought some of the sences where going to be taken in the ghetto my fault for not paying more attention to the review. I had read a story with a white guy and a black guy and from the time I saw it was along that line I decided to purchase it cause the story I read was so good. Anyways it was a very deep movie, saddness lingered throughout, heartbreaking. Buy it for what it is if you like sad movies otherwise leave it be, I think the dvd cover art is a little misguiding a bit as well."
2,Unrealistic,"I bought this title because of some good reviews on Amazon, but found it generally contrived and hard to take seriously. The production values were decent and the setting was quite beautiful, but the direction was lacking and the characters were very underdeveloped. I really had to stretch myself to not see most of the characters as cliches or unknowns. I'd have to be really bored to watch it again."
2,Really???,Completely unbelievable story. The characters were completely opposite of each other and never would have attracted in real life. If you have nothing else to do I say watch this movie.
2,Not heavy duty,"I wore these gloves while splitting wood with a wood-splitter. The bark on the logs is rough and wore through one of the thumbs after only 5 hours! If you're going to be doing real work, I would not recommend these. For light duty work they'd be OK. The fit is nice."
4,A Very Good Read,This is a very enjoyable read. The story is fast paced and all of the characters have their opportunities to shine. The story is primarily centered around Trance who is experiencing quantum leaps of reality and living other potential time lines while the crew of the Andromeda are desperately trying to find a way to repair the ship and a dark secret awaits them on the 'abandoned' Waystation.... pretty good stuff! I definitely recommend this book.
5,Press the kindle button to get Kindle/iPhone version,"I use this Bible in my Japanese studies. I like it a lot and really appreciate the furigana. I'd like to get a version for the Kindle iPhone app, and hope others will click the link and encourage the publisher to do this."
5,A real cool book. Review from the daughter of this account.,A great way of studying Japanese along side an English Bible translation.Much of the Kanji in this book comes with Furigana (small characters above the Kanji that tell you how to pronounce the Kanji).
1,pendulum power,"This book was not what I expected. I would not buy it again. It mainly consists of the history of the pendulum with very little ""how to"" involved. It was a waste of my money."
4,Sticks Its Neck Out,"This is a handy tool, solidly built and you'll find a surprising number times you'll be glad for the swivel neck for getting into awkward places. The neck locks firmly into place, with no play. The quick change bit system makes changing bits fast and painless, and the three finger trigger is nice and comfortable to use with great control over drill speed.Two things niggle me about it though. As someone else mentioned, it seems to have low torque even at the highest setting, so you should only get this for fairly light household and assembly chores. And the battery charge cap does not give any visual clue as to when the battery is fully charged, so you have a hard time knowing when it's full again.Other than that, it's a great drill!"
3,Where is the torque?,The versatility of this swivel drill drew my attention and I bought one only to learn this unit lacks the torque I get with my Panasonic cordless drill drivers. This tool looks good and has nice ergonomics but it can't get the job done in high torque projects.
4,GREAT LITTLE TOOL,I had several projects planned and some included installing sliding shelves in cabinets. This presents a problem because standard drills don't fit for this job. This small drill is perfect for small jobs and not very expensive. Charging is quick but the battery pack doesn't last very long.
1,SOME LEMONS,"I purchased this based on the many positive reviews it received. However, my experience was unfortunately the same as two other minority reviewers. The Battery took its initial charge and unit worked fine. Next time I needed to use it, after spending a couple of months on the shelf, I expected to need to recharge it (the drill not me). No dice though, battery will not take a second charge. So it's your call whether it's worth the 5% risk of getting a dud. I have taken 20:1 odds on other Amazon purchases, so I'm glad it was not too expense an item that turned up craps. It's beyond Amazon's return policy so I'll need to see if B&D warranty lasts more than 90 days. Not betting on it."
3,I Liked it Until the Switch Broke,"This drill/driver is handy, light weight and the battery holds a charge for quite a while. I have had this drill for about 4 years but have used it very little as I keep it in my travel trailer and have an 18v cordless drill for home use. Recently, the variable speed switch has become more and more erratic-pull the trigger and nothing happens. Click it several times and it may or may not work. Disappointed that this did not last longer as it is a useful tool."
3,Good for light house work,Not a particularly powerful motor. But it will work fine for most.The five position gimmick? It's just that. There is a reason most professional quality drills have kept the same basic shape over the years.
4,Great tool for small jobs,"This cordless tool is great for small jobs, and seems to have plenty of power and spunk. However, if you were going to be doing a lot of work on a big project - this drill isn't the one for big jobs. It is light-weight and plastic - which is lighter to work with and the ability to reach hard to get to places is what it is mainly designed for - for that it is great."
5,Great Product,"This product is really nice. It is light and convenient, plus I like the movable head."
2,i like it.....but what happens when the battery dies,"well you may have read my previous review praising this tool. It IS a good tool, but I've checked ...Amazon and so on, and I cannot find a battery for this tool.I even checked the [manufacter] website, nothing listed. So be wary, you may only get to use this for a short timethank you"
5,Great addition,"This is the best power screwdriver I have ever used. The battery lasts a long time, and the power and flexibility are unmatched."
4,Good product,This Drill/Driver is great for any projects. Its easy to use. Its a little bulky though. Other then that it's ok. I would recommand it. Price is not too expensive. I bought mind at a great discount.
4,Great price point...,"and so far, works very well. lots of bits included and a great storage case. Buy It now!!!"
1,Piece of junk - no power and battery was dead in 30 days.,DO NOT WASTE your money - piece of junk. Go buy a real one. Only reason why I didn't return it was because the shipping cost. The vendor was as you would expect..but the black and decker is not what it should be.
3,"gimmicky, but works","This drill reminds me of a riddle I heard when I was a kid, ""What's the furthest you can be into the woods?""The answer: ""halfway"".So why would I need a drill that pivots 180 degrees? After 90 degrees, you're just repeating positions, and I only use 1 or 2 as it is. That being said, this is an okay little drill that has good battery life and gets the job done. my biggest issue is that the drill bits don't fully lock into place, wiggling annoyingly for about 1/4 cm in the socket. After heavy use, i can safely say they're not going anywhere, but i'd prefer a drill that I could tighten the bits with a key, regardless of how much the head pivots."
5,Does Everything I Need it To.,"First of all let me say that I don't know anything about heavy industrial uses for a drill so I am not qualified to speak of such issues as I have never been a tradesman. Further, I have never been asked to take part in any projects in which I had anything to do aside from digging or simple grunt work. Therefore, the other reviewers are far better qualified than I in regards to judging whether this drill is effective in diverse settings. I bought mine strictly for home use. I just got a new condo and the 12V comes in handy for everything I need to do. It drilled holes perfectly for cabinet handles and cabinet knobs. I also made steady use of it for the putting up of window treatments. The model was reliable and I have no complaints. It appears ideal for simple home operations and is a great addition to my toolbox. Also, considering that I got mine for 37 bucks--it's financially a good deal."
5,The Art Of Screaming Rocks!!!!!!!!!!,"The Art Of Screaming is Fantastic!!!!I have been singing for over 20 years. I have purchased so many singing/instructional CD'S that are difficult to understand and do nothing!!!!!The Art Of Screaming package is hands down the best out there.Not only do you receive a DVD of a live lesson (which makes you feel like you are right there) to practice with, you also receive a cd that you can rehearse with before a show, on tour,in the shower, where ever you are ,Sue Carr is right there with you with invaluable instruction on the correct way to do it all. And it's fun.This CD/DVD combo has changed my whole thought process on how to sing, and not to sound to corny but it has changed my life!!!!If you want to better your vocals this package is totally worth checking out!!!!"
5,Great CD,I wish Aaraon would come out with some more songs and albums. He hits a homerun with all songs.
2,"Sky Island, no illustrations","Probably my fault, but I understood that this edition included illustrations from the original publication, which are wonderful. When the book arrived, of course, I found there were none.If you purchase this edition, be aware."
3,Not great,"This fairy book has some wise philosophy about xenophobia and cruel leadership, but the charm is thin. Baum wrote it during the hiatus when he hoped he'd written his last Oz book. Fortunately, public demand defeated him."
1,Why take out the illustrations?,"Why at all publish a book such as this one and take out the original illustrations? It just doesn't make any sense. I understand that (the publisher) Dover has reissued this book in a closer to its original form, with illustrations. It puzzles me that Amazon only carries this non-illustrated version instead of the Dover edition."
1,Ryan Adams - does he know who he is?,"I have ALL of Ryan Adams' music, including Whiskeytown. I've really liked (loved) some CDs and songs and rated him as one of my favorite artists. I was anticipating this CD and am very, very disappointed. It meanders all over the place, like how Ryan himself meanders all through a performance. I've seen Ryan perform live twice. Each time, I wonder if he even knows where he is. He reminds me very much of a friend of mine who has ADD. I often wonder if Ryan has ADD, but it's probably just the booze and drugs.Ryan Adams is/was/might be a good song writer, good musician, or good singer. However, one CD after another simply meanders across a range of styles and emotions. I bought this CD, but will NOT buy Jacksonville City Nights or any others. After experiencing how he treats (mistreats) his fans at his concerts, I'd rather give my money to better musicians and better people. Check out Neil Young's Prairie Wind for a far superior artist and a much better person!!!"
3,Disapointing with Few Gems,"After hearing much greatness about this album, and hearing it being compared to one of the greatest albums of the year (Bright Eye's 'I'm Wide Awake It's Morning')I had to get it and listen to it. I am a little disapoited in it but don't get me wrong, it is a good album and much better than most music out there but it clearly is not as good as the new Bright Eyes disc who he is compared to often. There are, however a few WONDERFUL songs that are worth getting the album for like 'Friends', 'When Will You Come Back Home?' and 'How Do you Keep Love Alive'! Those are all excellent tracks but this album is flawed. His writing for one has no great skills and his singing is to 'pop' for anything of great value. But it is worth it - believe me!"
3,When will you come back home?,"The first disc isn't very good but the second disc has its moments, some of it sounds like the songs I don't like on Pneumonia or worse while some of it is quite good. I would say on Cold Roses Ryan is in the same town of Jacksonville Skyline and Heartbreaker but still can't seem to find his way home.I remember the rose but honey down at Midway Park the cold roses will soon be forgotten."
2,A real snoozer,"If you're looking for more upbeat Ryan Adams' songs like New York, New York....well, look elsewhere. This album is so mellow it's depressing."
3,Nice Vocals,"While i don't dislike this disc, it doesn't really move me either. I have heard that all of Ryan's discs are very different from each other which i appreciate in a musician. So while tihs isn't a disc i can say stands out, it's certainly not terrible and his voice is beautiful. I have heard other songs of his that i really like so perhaps another disc would do the trick"
5,Excellent & Timeless,"I am a late convert to the brilliance of Ryan Adams. I know there are differences to his solo work vs that with the Cardinals, but nevertheless this is an outstanding consistent body of work that never gets old. Ranges from poetic to haunting to downright beautiful. Listen to ""How do you keep love alive"" and try not to be moved."
4,"""Strangers Almanac"" fans rejoice","A really beautiful album. There's not much more to say, except that Adams delivers in a manner that I haven't heard since Whiskeytown's second LP a decade ago."
5,Perfect!!!,This is an excellent album full of melodic hooks and inspiring lyrics. It is one of those albums that has really grown on me and I continue to be amazed with the tunes. A must have for any fan of music.
1,lame-o same-o,"i just dont understand, as if wilco wasn't bad enough. this guy's gotta go and beat it into the ground with a rubber mallet."
4,I'm a Convert!,"I was into Whiskeytown. Then lost track along the spew of RA solo releases. It was a lot to keep up with. And the sound kept darting in new directions. The critics didn't help. ""Cold Roses"" brings it all back home ... and into a whole new perspective. Adams is finally rightfully presenting himself as an ambitious, eclectic songwriter and song-stylist whose vision is unpredictable without caprice. Okay ... having said that: ""Easy Plateau"" and ""Magnolia Mountain"" are stuck in my head and I don't want to let 'em go. I will now gleefully re-explore RA's entire catalog with new ears. And I await every surprise this artist has yet to commit to posterity."
5,Ryan Adams and the Cardinals - Cold Roses,"Prior to hearing Ryan Adams music I was a country music hater. Now that I've had the opportunity to enjoy this CD and others I have seen the error of my ways throughout the years. Seriously, I cannot say I will now flush out my music collection with a comprehensive country collection, but I will be open to purchasing a CD here and there.Cold Roses is full of emotions joy, pain, sorrow, longing, and loss. Do a little research on Ryan Adams and you'll find a good deal of knowledge comes with this effort.If you do not buy this CD G Godon Liddy will break your kneecaps!"
5,Best of 2005 so far,"My title says it all, maybe the best in twenty years.Since Mr. Adams has two more dics coming before the endof the year, who knows."
4,hits and misses,"There are bits and pieces of everyone's reviews that I can agree with. First of all, Ryan does need an editor. I am not a detractor of Ryan's work. The music world is much better off with Ryan than without. Rock needs him and so does country. However, you do kind of wonder when he will put it all together, and come up with, dare I say, a concise album? Secondly, when an artist gets too grandiose and writes more songs than humanly possible, he is in danger of producing crap as well as the good stuff(maybe all the crap is for the sake of the good songs). And Ryan Adams is most definitely guilty of this. That being said, this is a very good double album which, when it hits the mark, hits it dead center. Songs like Magnolia Mountain, Easy Plateau, and Dance all Night are beautiful expressions. The influences are definitely there but they blend. That's when the magic happens with Ryan. At any rate, Ryan equals risk(in more ways than one), and he is well worth the misses for the hits."
2,"Easy Plateau, indeed","One of the songs on the new Ryan Adams CD is called ""Easy Plateau."" It's an especially poignant title in that it's a polite way of summing up the feel of the whole darn album. Filled with mid-tempo drivel and buffed to a high production sheen, there's absolutely nothing here to grab onto - no pathos, no ebb-and-flow, no peaks and valleys. It's like someone sucked all the spooky ethos out of Chris Isaac and shoved a lap steel player into the studio with him.This is the genius behind Whiskeytown?"
5,Spectacular,"You've got to be atleast a bit skeptical when an artist says he has enough material to put out four albums in one year. I in fact, was skeptical. So I purchased his first double-disk album of the year of the four to be released and have listened to it through and through and boy am I impressed. I personally feel that there are no bad songs on this album and is best to be listened to from song one of disk one to song nine of disk two, straight through with no pauses or skips. It's a very good album in which I'd recommend to any Ryan Adam's fan."
5,I LOVE this album honestly,"I am not a music expert, or a critic, just a regular person who loves music but gets bummed when I shell out for an album and it ends up that I don't like most of it, and I'm disappointed. I have all of Ryan Adams' previous albums, and I love and treasure them all, but there's always been one of two songs on all of them I haven't really liked, but that is not the case with Cold Roses. I rate it 5-stars because I think every single song, from beginning to end is great. The melodies, the harmony, the lyrics, everything. A lot of them sounds really personal too, like Heartbreaker, and it seems like every song is perfect. I saw an interview Ryan did on Much Music and he said ""I know I'm not the greatest song writer in the world and I'm never going to be- but I really love doing it, and it doesn't hurt anybody"". After this, I could argue many he is one of the great ones! I hope everyone who buys this album enjoys it as much as me. Thank you for reading this."
4,Ryan Adams - Cold Roses,"First off we must stop comparing Ryan Adams Latest work with those of his past, simply because those songs are classics their a staple of alt-rock. The songwriting, melody, and atmosphere can never be outdone. They are damn near perfect. This latest work is resemblent of those earlier works. Some songs are well put together and and great to chill and listen too, others are not but overall the feeling is still their and he is still Ryan Adams.-Q"
5,haunting,"I read this book about 30 years ago and it remains one of the most memmorable. The last paragraph touched me and remains one of the most poignant ""literary moments"" of my life. Maybe I need to get out more, or maybe it strikes a common cord within us all."
3,Vaguely politically incorrect,"My copy of this book was published in 1971. Reading it, I felt an uncomfortable fascination, as though I were witnessing the author pandering to the white man's fascination with the ""wild indian."" In other words, one of the characters of the tale happened to be half Cherokee, which apparently explained the macabre little fetishes, his ability to hunt small animals and eat them raw, and his love of living in holes in his own filth. Stereotyping? I could just imagine what someone from AIM would say about it. I think if something like this were released today, there would be quite an outcry.Apart from that it's a fun diversion and a quick read - a little guilty pleasure on a summer afternoon. An illustration in how child neglect and abandonment can affect all of us.I might recommend it to others, but not without warning them that they might find it a little offensive. Or illuminating."
2,"Good when a teenager, bad when an adult...","I read this book as a teenager and remembered it as scary. On this reading, however, the book is merely inane.The flaw with this book is that the two 'adoptees' of the psychopath living in their basement do not behave within any boundaries of normalcy whatsoever. The novel is touted as one of ""growing menace and terror"" but is instead one of growing ridiculousness and boredom."
5,Just What I Needed,This book has an excellent overview of writing with early learners. It also has great activities and strategies for engaging students in learning to write. Wonderful!
1,This is some sort of joke!,"I came upon this author through the other reviews he's given to REAL authors on astral projection. I read the commennts on his first book, and there he claims having been jailed in heaven and been tortured lol. Further, he claims to have fought demons. On this volume, he claims to have been to hell and purgatory lol.Notwithstanding, he has numerous grammatical and syntax errors in this book. It is reflected that his native language is not English. He at least could have gotten an editor.Anyway, I did have a laugh with the little that I read thanks to Amazon's willingness to let you search through the books.Sapphire now go learn some good English and practice astral projection with a reputable expert please!"
1,"Don't buy, waste of money and space for your fx5","When i first purchased 2 fx5, this was one of the recommended product to buy with along with the bio-max. Let me say that you don't need this item, as its a complete waste of money and space in your fx5. There are way more better media than this. Many people i have search on the the web have opt to have their fx5 loaded with nothing but bio-media."
5,Evokes a true sense of hunting,"Henry Chappell has hunted and fished all over Texas and the American southwest. An accomplished sports writer, his articles, essays and short stories have appeared in a wealth of hunting, fishing, wildlife, and sports magazines. In At Home On The Range With A Texas Hunter, Chappell offers a series of engaging, highly recommended essays on the bonds that exist between hunter, hunting dog, land, and prey. From hunting Bobwhites in the Texas Panhandle, to prairie grouse in the Flint Hills of Kansas, Gambel's quail in New Mexico arroyos, blue quail on the staked plains, or doves and Mearns' quail in Arizona, Chappell evokes a true sense of hunting, complete with its responsibilities and ethics."
3,Not a good text for learning neural development,"I was unfortunate enough to take a class on neural development where this text was our primary text. The book is written in the format of what appears to be journal articles, or reviews by various authors on the different subjects. It is not written in textbook style. Furthermore, in this manner of writing, the book does not provide enough background information on the subjects that it covers. It automatically assumes that the reader fully understands the subjects that it is intending to teach. I do not recommend this as a primary text for a class. It would serve a wonderful job as a supplement for a class or to provide someone knowledgable in developmental neuroscience a ""refresher"" or update on what is currently known in this subject. However, I do not feel that it should be used to TEACH developmental neuroscience."
3,"Maybe a Master, but regretfully didn't get it","This is a typical old British zigzagging slow-motion thriller(?) that needed you to read along with an English housekeeper's patience. I prefer Forsyth, Follett and Archer's modern English more than this Grand Diamond Dagger Master's, and would like to skip it anytime possible; just a personal thought."
2,Not as good as the Wailing Jenny's,"I bought this CD based on a suggestion from a Wailing Jenny's review that these were similar bands. I did listen to the snippets here on Amazon but after I played the full music a couple of times, I'm not very happy with it. The songs are (lyrics & music) good, but the lead singer's voice just grates on my ears. So like Bob Dylan, you either love'm or you hate'm. And in this case I fall in the latter category."
1,Warning: laced with arsenic!,"I am a firm believer in submission as taught in the Bible. The author of this book, however, has ""exceeded what is written."" Does your husband require you to get an abortion? No problem, just pray about it and God will change his mind! What immature reasoning is this? Just because it has happened in some cases does not make it normative for all! Stay away from this book. It can lead you into sin!"
1,Obey God Rather Than Man,"I would not recommend this book, because the teaching on the TOTAL submission to the point of sin is wrong. This book turns page 16 & 17 Adams' sin into a good deed. This was not a good deed, but a sin of Gods law. Disobedience to God for the sake of reaching someone else is wrong. The book on page 20 & 22 implies, the husband can save the wifes body. ""For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body."" Jesus is our savior In the book page 31 suggests obeying the Husband rather than God.Here are a couple of websites for further review...[...] [...]I would not recommend this book as it will confuse you, about the submission God is talking about."
5,Amazing book!,I'm so grateful I found this little book in our church library. In fact I loved it so much I purchased a copy for myself. This is really key for any woman or young girl to read to prepare for marriage. It is VERY biblical and gives us the right perspective on how we are to view our husbands/future husbands as well as how to be biblically submissive to them. Wonderful book!
1,Bad Interpretation Leads to Inaccurate Conclusions,"Ms. Handford's book, though put together in a thoughtful manner, fails to accurately interpret the passages she uses as her Biblical ""proof"". She does what Bible Scholars call, ""Isogesis,"" meaning that she comes to the scriptures with assumptions about what it says and looks for scripture to back her up, rather than letting the scripture speak for itself.When one reads scripture without coming to it with motivation of trying to prove a point, you will be able to see that her interpretation of the creation account(s) in Genesis is horribly skewed.Don't read this book. It's a waste of your time. Find another book that accurately assesses the scripture instead. Allow me to recommend: Good News for Women: A Biblical Picture of Gender Equality by Rebecca Merrill Groothuis as a book that takes conclusions drawn by those with poor interpretation and looks at them in light of scripture."
1,Obey God Rather Than Man,"I would not recommend this book, because the teaching on the TOTAL submission to the point of sin is wrong. This book turns page 16 & 17 Adams' sin into a good deed. This was not a good deed, but a sin of Gods law. Disobedience to God for the sake of reaching someone else is wrong. The book on page 20 & 22 implies, the husband can save the wifes body. ""For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body."" Jesus is our savior In the book page 31 suggests obeying the Husband rather than God.Here are a couple of websites for further review...[...]Start on page 8, ...[...] AND [...]I would not recommend this book as it will confuse you, about the submission God is talking about."
1,Finally--a book for Stepford Wives!,"If you'd rather not have a thought in your pretty little Stepford wife head, this is your book. Frankly, as a Christian woman, this book makes me laugh and feel sick by turns. I thank God that I am married to a man who expects me to be an equal partner. This book tries to prettify the word ""submission,"" but we all know what it means. I'm sorry for the little girls who grow up in homes where the mothers and fathers truly believe this stuff."
1,Legalistic,"Ms. Handford is asking wives to ignore their consciences when faced with a husband's command to sin. She says God will always, always (her words) provide an ""out"" for the wife who knows what her husband is asking her to do is sin. If He doesn't, it's because He sees she is not willing to obey, anyway.Ms. Handford's whole premise bypasses the high incidence of spousal abuse today and the fact that a controlling, sadistic husband can use this book to destroy his wife. Her solution to a situation like this? Submit ever more deeply, faithfully and thoroughly. In this way lies madness for emotionally and physically battered wives who can no longer discern what is rational and what is not.Following this teaching, a woman can potentially ignore all Scriptures except those specifically addressed to wives."
3,Cause for Concern: Dangerous Interpretation of Scripture,"As a newlywed, I am reading everything under the sun about marriage, blended families, etc. I am in the process of surrendering to God's will for my marriage which requires me to submit to my husband. It has been a wonderful yet challenging learning experience.That said, I was taken aback by many of Hanford's interpretations of the historical events in the Bible. She referenced several couples (Abraham & Sarah; David & Michal; Queen Vashti & King Ahasuerus) in the Bible to augment her argument that a woman is to submit to her husband. I found her interpretations to be assuming, misconstrued, and incomplete.I hesitantly recommend the book with this caveat - Open your heart and mind to the book's overall message, Our (women's) submission to our Lord is God's plan for our marriage. Submitting to our husbands, ultimately, demonstrates our faith and trust in our Lord and Savior."
1,Well..,All I wanted was for these to fit in my ears and make sounds when they were plugged into an audio device. At the price I wasn't expecting much more. They do make sound when plugged into an audio device. But I cannot insert them into my ears or put them in any position in which they will remain near my ears without the assistance of my hands.
1,How much would you pay for pain?,"I bought these because the price was right, and that I am not an audiophile. I was merely looking for something cheap to watch movies on my laptop and figured, hey, how bad can these be?These earbuds are more like ear-PILLARS - they dig into your ears! Plus, the cheap-o foam covers NEVER stay on!Avoid these at all costs and buy something else. It is a shame that this product is even legal."
1,OUCH!,"These are too long to fit well resting in the outer ear and too thick to fit in the canal. They're much less comfortable than the earbuds that came with my Sansa MP3 player, and the sound quality isn't as good, either. I'll be replacing mine before they wear out--a first for me!"
2,Not recommended,"There are two ways to wear these earbuds. You can rest them inside the rim of your earlobe, only to have them fall out as soon as you turn your head. Or you can try to squeeze the oversized buds into your ear canals, taking them out 15 minutes later when you can't stand the pain any longer. The discomfort does go away after a few days, once your ears have been broken in.Repeatedly removing the buds from your ears will eventually cause the foam padding to come off. I was able to wriggle to foam back over the buds, but after it continued to fall off again and again, I stopped bothering. Since the foam adds to the size of the earbuds, removing the pads actually increased the comfort level.The sound quality is about on par with laptop speakers, which is perfectly satisfactory to me. I have not had any problems with them being too quiet.I would not recommend these. You're much better off spending a few extra bucks on a halfway decent set of decent earbuds/phones."
1,A waste of money,"Although they were cheap (about $5), they are worth nothing. You can barely hear the sound come through, even with the volume turned as loud as possible. They are also very uncomfortable in your ear."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I've purchased some Koss products in the twenty to fifteen dollar range, and have been surprized by the sound quality, but I was dissapointed by these. I was hoping to use them with my ipod (my apple earbuds are a little blown out), but they are way less powerful than the apple earbuds. I had to turn the volume all the way up just to equal the sound that I got from my apple earbuds at normal volume. And even then, the sound was less full and warm sounding. I immediately converted back to my blown out apple earbuds. These headphones are not terrible, they're good for their price, but I expected greatness. Just go ahead and spend some extra money."
1,Inferior sound and uncomfortable fit,"If you are like me, you will be attracted to the low price on this set of earbuds. I am going to recommend you stay away from this set for two reasons:1) Due to the large and uncomfortable size, my ears would have a feeling of soreness after wearing these for an extended period of time.2) The sound quality is inferior in a way that can best be described as having a lack of bass.I highly recommend purchasing SONY earbuds instead of this cheapo set. Your ears will thank you for it."
1,Earbuds,These were a waste of money (only $5). They don't stay in you ears whether you are running exercising or even walking. Plus they hurt your ears after a short time. So if you plan on buying these for any physical activities dont even bother.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"These ear buds are the biggest waste of money, even if it is less than $5. They offer poor sound quality in all frequency ranges. In addition to that, they wear your ear out because of a poor fit and the fact that they don't stay in place. By wearing your ear out, I mean just that. They actually tire your ears out from the fitting, or lack there of."
1,Very VERY dissappointing.,"While the quality was pretty good, I was distracted by the fact that the output was very little; at full blast, could only hear at normal levels. The earpieces are big and dont seem to be erganomicaly designed for ears. The foam covers were a little helpful for that problem, but fell off very easily, like if you store them in your pocket instead of the carying case, and when the covers are gone, the phones became very annoying to listen through.I recently bought the panasonic RP-HV152 to replace them and all of the problems of the Koss product were fixed by the Panasonic product. At a similar price range, about four to five dollars, it is a much better suggestion and reccomendation."
2,My ears must not be normal...,"While I agree with the other reviewer who said the sound quality on these ear buds is great, I was not able to make these stay in my ears, no matter how hard I tried. On the rare occasion when they did stay, I soon had to remove them because of the pain they caused. The ""bud"" part that goes into the ear seems overly large, the padding is thin and easily removable, and there is nothing for the ear to grab on to. I am continuing my search for the perfect ear buds...."
2,Terrible,"Though it had great sound quality, the foam covering of the hard palstic speakers fell off after two uses, one cover being lost never to be seen again, the other falling off repeatedly, no matter how I reapplied it."
4,Rockers through Amazon,"Received quickly. This was a trial situation for me. First, I ordered two, one ivory and one almond to see what would look best on my wall. Almond was a great blend for my existing paint. Ivory was a slant to a yellowed beige. Then, I was interested in a quieter than existing switch outlet. Didn't happen, so I won't be using these. My engineering husband says the regular switches are easier to repair anyway. If you are just determined to use rockers, Amazon has the best prices."
5,Amazing!,"I couldn't believe what I was reading! It is astounding and well-written. Phillips offers a completely objective perspective on the most shocking history imaginable for a town such as Bristol. ""Pioneers"" offers a glimpse into a world that was in our region and remains ignored. The corrupt, the fights, the evolution of a town and the ghosts of the past remain in the minds of many. It's apparent that Phillip's desire to retain the colorful history of the region will continue to amaze and fascinate new generations."
5,love it,This is a great product. However I don't appreciate this site requirirg me to go on and on when I can sum this up in one or two words.
2,Some kind of joke?,"The Dragon Reborn must have been published as a joke. There's no plot, the dialogue is terrible, and the characters are boring. I'll never read another Nelson book again. This is the worst book I've ever read in my life."
5,Best book in this subject,"This book is the best book I've seen in assembly language/architecture. It's very clear, thorough, and concrete. It is really superb in how it teaches system concepts. And it shows how C++ and Java works, in addition to how computers work. It has a great chapter on the JVM. It also covers the SPARC and the Pentium. By means of the included software, the reader can design, implement, and test new architectures."
5,the proper way to train a horse to the bridle,This book is a must for anyone who aspires to train a horse to the proper way to become a bridle horse. It is not for anyone who seeks a quick and easy way to bridle a horse. It takes time and effort as well as patience. It's not a quick fix. Well worth the effort!!!!
5,It's exactly what I wanted,"After going to many Scottish Festivals and seeing these moulds, I knew I wanted one. The recipes that were included were easy."
2,Do you all work for Black and Decker?,"It's a great idea but if you are going to do a day or weekend long project that would require one or more of the attachments, get extra batteries! The only attachments that didn't kill the battery quickly were the drill and maybe the saw wasn't great. The other pieces especially the router and jigsaw drained both batteries noticably in about 15 minutes. I've found the router adequate only for edge and laminate work but way underpowered for anything else.Don't even get me started on the safety start mechanism. You must depress a button on the attachments before the trigger will engage. This is especially maddening and awkward with the router.Save your money and buy the real versions of each tool you really need instead of this poor compromise on all of them."
4,Solid tool; smart design.,"All interchangable heads mounted easily, quickly and securely. Drill: two (variable) speeds; adjustable clutch; nice amount of torque. Router: only mounts 1/4"" bits; does a nice job edging shelves; worked surprisingly well. Sander: of limited use, but it worked fine; lots of B+D ""Mouse"" accessories available. Jig Saw: cuts quickly; buy an assortment of blades (metal, wood, etc). Circular Saw: cuts very quickly with little waste (thin kerf); great for sheets of plywood, mdf board and drywall; only cuts to a depth of one-inch. Overall, this tool is great for the small home workshop. I feel at ease when the kids cut wood for birdhouses using this tool rather than a full-size C-saw or (eeek!) a tablesaw. Comes with two batteries... should be good enough for most projects. Has a quality feel to it."
4,Great for the occasional fixes around the house,"LIKES1) Great price. This use to be 99$ back then.2) Multi tool. 5 tools in one! Thats like 20$ each tool.3) Comes with spare battery and a nice bag.DISLIKES1) Not powerful enough for the router, circ saw2) Circ Saw doesnt cut really deep3) Router is really miniature4) Batteries die fast w/ the router, circ saw5) A little on the heavy side"
2,Poorly-supported thesis,"While Kincaid makes a number of interesting points on the way Western culture venerates The Child (and includes some insightful historical and literary evidence), the book falls apart after the introductory chapters. Since this book was written some decades ago, the work is unfortunately outdated and fails to take a critical eye to class and race in the analysis. I wonder what this book would be if it were written within the last 5 years."
4,wrong book reviewed and rather rushed too!!,"I meant too review ""Harmful to minors"" which I read not this one which I didn't read (in its entirety)-- but I'm against the fear mongers that wish to frighten and repress young people (esp teens) -- read Freud--children are already sexual--they can be repressed not ""sexualized"
1,Negative 1.000 rating,"I don't own this book, nor have a read it. The description was enough. But since I was asked to write a review I'd say don't defile yourself by reading something so disgusting either."
5,great,"Love those babes. Love their music, it is great to watch them, too.I wish Camille West was still on the road."
4,Useful,I used this text for a course on 'Electric Machines & Power Systems'. So I found the relevant sections of this book extremely well-written and quite useful. The sections on power transmission and generation were quite excellent.
2,I do not like the camera work.,"The music is glorious, but my enjoyment of this series is greatly dimmed by the fact that the camera often jumps from one shot to another after just one second or less. Some viewers may like this approach to showing a symphony orchestra in concert, but it makes me nervous; I am very sorry to say that I cannot recommend these DVDs."
4,a scientific Must; also contains stuff for many movies,"Originally published 1899 by a British colonial officer, one of the very few people genuinely interested in what are one of the world's strangest people. This book contains a rather badly organized mess of government and other reports, documents, descriptions, all without an index - but what reports, what descriptions! This reviewer has spent weekends trying to locate quotes that he knew are mentioned somewhere in the 880 pages but couldn't remember where. In the end he made his own rough index despite the horrible effort infolved. It it was worth it. Besides the unique scientific stuff, this book contains the raw material for half-a-dozen adventure movies and parts of it are a jolly good read, too."
2,A book that gave me a headache,"This book is either badly written in original, badly translated, or both. The sentences are long and meandering, occasionally one sentence makes up an entire paragraph! The style is such that the reader doesn't always know whether Maritain is describing Bergson's positions or his own (shades of St.Thomas and his scholastic method?).Frankly, I stopped reading this book after a few chapters. It gave me a headache. Besides, we already know why Neo-Thomists reject Bergsonism. ""Rome has spoken, the matter is settled"".The rest is just commentary."
3,"Good International, Bad USA","This series used to contain ""raw comments"" from students which I found very interesting. Now, Business Week is the only one that publishes them.Interesting statistics, good summaries. But pretty duplicative of any other book, web site, WSJ, BW, etc.Except for international. Very highly recommended if you're looking at international schools off the beaten path.Getting long in the tooth."
5,Doctor Dunbar's Good Little Dog Book,Good information for new puppy and for existing dogs. Positive training ideas. Step by step instructions. Good reference book.
4,Essential Reading for Serious Jews,"Maimonides' philosophical opus presents his views on biblical interpretation, creation, the nature of prophecy, the reasons for the commandments, divine providence, free will, and many other topics. The Guide is one of the most influential works of Jewish philosophy ever written, and is well worth the effort of reading. Unfortunately, it is an effort with this edition, as the type is absurdly small."
5,A Difficult and Perplexing Work,"An excellent work by a late medieval Jewish theologian/metaphysicist (a contemporary of Aquinas) who presents and breaks down the metaphysical arguments of the day for the existence of God, a God-created universe, and the interpretation of the Torah. He examines the Aristotelian arguments supporting the eternal existence of the Universe and determines whether or not they are supported by Scripture and logical analysis. Our contemporary physicists could use his methods to uncover logical flaws in their theories about the ultimate origins of the Universe. He finishes the text with a treatise on Scripture and the perfection of Man. A must read along with the works of Augustine and Aquinas, and for that matter, any modern work on the ultimate nature of Nature.rac"
5,A Masterpiece,"This work of philosophy is in fact three books, the last one not really dealing with philosophy, is one of the greatest masterpieces of philosophy ever written. Composed almost a thousand years ago, it is still extremely relevant. Words cannot really describe it - you MUST read for yourself.The translation is pretty good, if sometimes difficult, in any case, it is a much easier read than the Hebrew translation."
2,"love Wedgits, but not so much this set","I had high hopes for this set--our son loves anything with wheels, and we love the flexibility of the original wedgits set. So this sounded perfect.But unfortunately all this set does is include some wheels. Not very many, and not with very much flexibility as to what you can do with them. Very low on the suggestions for vehicles you can build, and in fact it's hard to build anything that looks or acts much like a vehicle.High expectations, not met. Hence the low rating."
2,Wedgits: love but not this,"I love the other Wedgits set we have and was very much looking forward to this set. I had seen some reviews saying the wheel assembly was difficult to put together. It is VERY difficult for anyone under 15. Then once you have the assemble together, you build your vehicle, but if you attempt to move it, it falls apart. The pieces are durable but not what I was hoping for. I love their products but was extremely disappointed."
3,Very unusual Vincent Price Movie!,"This western, made 1966 in South Afrika, is a very strange remake of YELLOW SKY (1948). It reminds me a little bit of two Monte Hellman western (THE SHOOTING and RIDE IN THE WIRLWIND) made around the same time. Major interest is Vincent Price as an old gold digger, who lives with his graddaughter in the desert and gets in trouble with a gang of bankrobbers. If you're an admirer of Vincent, you have to see this!Talking about the Brentwood DVD: The quality is okay for a rare film like this and the cheap price. Colors are a bit fadad red. The main problem is, that the film isn't complete: It runs only 93 minutes, than the correct (and on the cover mentioned) 105 minutes! But probably we'll never get the chance to see it better!There is also a tape available. I don't know it, but think it's made from the same source. If you own it you don't need the DVD. If not get this one!"
3,much better than I expected!,"I just show the movie a couple of days ago on Fox Movie Channel. Even though Vicent Price is given top billing, it's more of a supporting role. I wasn't too crazy about it's premise (cowboys in South Africa). However, by the end of the movie, I liked it.As previous reviewers have stated, granddaughter and grandfather (Price) try to protect gold from 5 outlaws. One of them falls for the granddaughter and decides to change his ways. Not original, but fun since it takes place in South Africa rather than the old west. I've haven't seen the original, YELLOW SKY, so I can't comment if this film is better or worse.As far as the length of the film is concerned, the one I saw on Fox Movie Channel had a runing time of 93 minutes. If there is a longer version, either Fox doesn't have the missing scenes or it really is only 93 minutes and the distribution company made a mistake on the running time."
3,disappointed,I am a big Vincent Price fan but I did not like this movie at all. It is kind of stupid. Not entertaining at all. sorry
5,Best ever Waffles,I gave this as a gift and it has been wonderful for my son and his family. We all love the waffles and convenience of having 2 waffles ready at once. It is great for holiday breakfasts and suppers.I heartily recommend this to everyone.
3,Completed the Whitecross collection,"OK, I've been a longtime Whitecross fan. To be honest, I preferred mostly the Rex Carroll era, but I loved a lot of the tracks on Unveiled and Equilibrium. So I got this to finish the collection.There are some decent songs on it, but it is my least favorite album in the collection. I think they were trying to 'fit in' to the alternative 90's sound and weren't sure how to make it sound like the ""Whitecross"" sound. That's my opinion anyway.There were enough songs on it for the price that I was happy with the purchase. I'm glad I waited though, because if I had spent $18 on it back in the day, I wouldn't have felt the same.Overall, decent purchase."
2,Disappointment,"I'm a HUGE Whitecross fan, and this album is a disappointment compared to their other albums. The first song is awesome, and there a couple other pretty good ones. The rest of the album though is just OK at best. I would love to get the song Flytrap on an MP3 download."
1,It doesn't do a good job of grabbing your attention.,I'm the kind of person who loves a book that makes you want to never put it down.This book is nothing of the type.I was doing a research project and when I went in to get this book it was sitting on the shelf all dusty like it had never been touched. Now I know why.
4,Hump's Death?,"Crazy Horse has held a deep and sacred passion for me since childhood, I thoroughly enjoyed Mari Sandoz's book but can not understand why her account has Hump dying at the hands of the Snake's and in a time frame before Crazy Horse's own death(1877), one has only to read Dee Brown's ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" and view a photo of Hump dated in 1890 at Fort Bennett, South Dakota, additional research indicates that Hump died long after Crazy Horse. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could clarify this for me."
5,A definitive and unique biography of a legendary hero.,"This book and its' unique style succeeds in communicating history and personality. More so than a standard biography, Ms. Sandoz gives one the feel for the man and his character. The personalities of the protagonists are simulated for the reader. The background in history is strong enough to make most historical purists feel comfortable despite the styling of a novel. This book based on history; and ""Hanta Yo"",fiction based on culture, give the reader some of the best insights into the times from the mindset of the Lakota."
5,Great Story about a Great Man,"This book is well written, very interesting and hard to put down. The story it tells is very important in the history of North America. Crazy Horse is a significant historical figure to be admired and understood. I wish more Native American History was included in our primary and secondary educational system. If you want to know the truth about what our government did to the Indians, include this book in your reading list."
4,"A book for someone who knows how to play, but not well","This book helped me when I was learning. This book gives 3 basic openings and encourages the user to focus on just these. This is good advise for someone who knows how to play, but not well. These openings will get you into a sound middle game, and if your opponent is not careful they will make a mistake you'll be ready to capitalize on. I now follow a similar line of reasoning but I now use a differnt opening, the King's Indian...partly because it can be used for white or black, and it is more difficult to disrrupt. My favorite book for that is ""The Ultimate King's Indian Attack"" by Angus Dunnington."
3,What if your opponent doesn't cooperate?,I've been playing with the Stonewall opening and my opponent keeps not cooperating! I guess I need to read on to find out what to do when he doesn't follow....! It has helped me with developing my pieces and strategizing. I guess there is no perfect game.
5,Perfect for my use.,I got it to unscrew the caps from plastic 5 gal. military type gas containers that I couldn't get off any other way. I had screwed the caps down pretty tight to keep them from leaking when laying on their sides in the trunk of my car. It works great for that.Just FYI I found a wrench on ebay made especially for the military gas cans so I don't use this any more.
2,Not as good as I would have hoped,The book came in excellent condition but it was not what I was looking for. I gave it to my sister and she is getting a lot out of it. To each her own.
4,Great Value,This item is very nice looking especially for the price. We installed it in our new mudroom and it looks great.
3,Detailed and Dense,"This book is a wonderful reference and source of info, however it is really dense. It takes time to get through all the chapters and the wording."
1,Why?,"Why read this book by an author that speaks from a place of bitterness. His work is redundant. I would never purchase another book by this man. It is difficult to suggest others read a book when I have heard the message from the man himself. He speaks with bitterness and demeaning tones. He proclaims emphatically...""There is no such thing as a learning disability."" He declared that 9 out of 10 K-1 teachers are terrible. The presentation was one offensive comment after another. I left his presentation saddened and disappointed. I thought the man behind the words in his books was so much more. Every book I had purchased by this man went in the trash and I will never purchase another book by him. I have to say that the fact that Cunningham publishes with him makes me think I will never purchase anything by her again either. Where is integrity and respect for colleagues in the profession?"
2,You get what you pay for,I bought the same earbuds last year and those were great. The ones I got this year were not very good at all - but then again they are very inexpensive - you get what you pay for.
3,What you should expect,"Let's be honest. If you're considering this product, you're probably not worried about sound quality, comfort, sound isolation, etc. If you are, there are some out there for only 15 bucks with much better quality than these. For about 2 bucks a pair, with a convenient wind-up case, these headphones are decent for everyday laptop use and to undiscerning ears."
1,Incessant Jambs,"From day one this machine would jamb during every other fax transmission. We experienced nothing but frustration with it until it finally ceased to even receive faxes. Evidently something happened internally and it began stripping the fax tone from the incoming fax call. Consequently, the phone would ring and ring without ever connecting to receive the fax. We sent it back as defective and purchased a Brother machine instead. I do not recommend this device."
1,Out dated technology,"The Sharp Broadband Fax w DECT Handset UX-D1200SE does not perform as advertised. The technology for forwarding faxes to email is out of date. After 3 hours trying to make it work I called Sharp and their technicians told me the error message I was receiving indicated that the authentication software is not compatible with my email service provider, and that this is the case with most current providers. Nowhere on the Amazon, Sharp or other sites I visited to research this product is there any indication that this machine has been discontinued or is unlikely to perform as advertised because of changes in email technology. The Sharp technician said it has been discontinued for two years.Broadband Fax w DECT Handset UX-D1200SE"
1,A real turkey!,"I have to agree with the rest of these guys. My Sharp UX-D1200SE constantly returns a line error whenever I try to send a fax. And, like the one reviewer, I can't send faxes to email either. If only a good attorney would buy one of these turkeys."
4,Beautiful picture of lower-class subarban London,"The story plot is nothing extraordinary, nor are the characaters unique, but what sets this short novel apart from the rest is the vivid picture that Maugham creates of the lower section of the London society. The story flows freely with a lucid style of writing, arresting the reader's attention from the first pages to the last, and touches a chord in the reader's heart somewhere deep, all along the way. Definitely a work of class, more so, it was Maugham's first novel. The old adage 'morning shows the day' aptly describes what the writer achieves in this work and the masterpieces that follow (Of Human Bondage, The Moon and the Sixpence, The Razor's Edge, etc.)."
5,IF YOU DONT LIKE MISSY YOU CAN KISS A $$!!!!!!!!!,MISSY IS VERY CREATIVE IT WOULD TAKE SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY HAS NO RYTHEM TO DISS MY GIRL WHO EVER DIDN'T LIKE THIS ALBUM WOULDN'T KNOW TALENT IF IT BIT YOU ON THE BOOTY!!!!!!
3,Enjoyable civil war story but could have been better.,"Somehow this truncated movie leaves a lot hanging in the air. Not that the story is not complete, but more so because there are elements which seems to have been removed. Audie Murphy's acting is unexpected. He showed a lot of emotion and humanity very much unlike in those subsequent B westerns of his which paralleled the Clint Eastwood westerns."
2,Try Again!,This looks like a low budget version of a great American story. It would make a good candidate for a re-make (although I doubt if will ever happen).
4,"Heroism, Stephen Crane's exploration","I compared this classic story to Crane's short story, A Mystery of Heroism to ask ""What defines Heroism?"" Is cowardice a necessary part of courage? Does peer impact enhance or diminish heroism? Why is Heroism a burden? Juniors in high school related to this rite of passage piece. And,with Audry Murphy and Bill Mauldin, the flic connected to yet another War, WarII. Short, great for classroom."
2,To Hell and Back,"It was unclear when I purchased the DVD that it was operable only within the US DVD zone and not in Europe, where it was delivered. I suggest to highlight it better in order to avoid such problems. Thanks."
1,Doesn't help you hear at all,"My 8 year old spent his own money to buy this toy and was so disappointed in the results. It doesn't magnify sound at all. In fact, my kid's joke is that you actually hear better out of the ear you *haven't* put the ear but into because at least its not getting covered."
3,For my grandson,"We'll let him do a review when he gets them. Not much I can say about them. My ""spy days"" are over."
4,Super cute toy!,"This is definitely something to get for that spy in your life. Cool high-tech gadgets! The clip-on ear function is great in theory but there hasn't been a child yet to use this that didn't need help (all above age 8). With that in mind, it is a ton of fun watching them sleuth around the corners trying to spy on their compadres. Great, great fun, lots of laughs and giggles. Highly recommend!"
1,Junk!,"As with all the spy gear I ordered from Amazon, this too is junk. The brand name was the same for all the pieces and none of the pieces work as advertised. Very disappointing for children absolute junk."
2,Not as pictured,"The picture shows it covering the entire space between the second row of seats and the rear hatch. However, the actual product only covers where the third row goes. The third row has to be folded down, so it covers about half of the cargo area, which is not particularly useful."
4,"Love the book, hate the title","I thought the book was very helpful and a great eye opener to new photographers setting up a photography business. It really does drive point the fact that this is a BUSINESS first. I think the information was usefull and informative. I don't like the title though, this is a VERY difficult industry right now so to imply that anyone can make ""Big Bucks"" is a disservice. There is money to be made, but it takes a lot of work and business senese. Its a small think but reminds me of the mindset of the eightys and early ninetys..not the current state of the industry."
5,Best Business Book,"This is one of the best business books I've seen that's oriented to the freelance photographer, writer or any other biz person."
3,Not overly impressed,"With a little common sense you can skip reading Mr. Hollenbeck's book. Everytime I want more depth and detail, there is none, but in other ways the book is amazingly repitive and redundant."
1,This is a $12 Leviton 7599-W GFCI receptacle repackaged by Marinco,"I purchased this thinking there was some reason that Marinco would sell a 'marine' GFCI receptacle. What I received was a LEVITON 7599-W receptacle in a Marinco package. This is a $12 item found at almost any hardware store that Marinco is selling with a more than 300% markup. The item does not match the picture on this site, nor what is shown on the Marinco site. Out of curiosity I called WestMarine and one other store, and they verified that it is a LEVITON 7599 in the package.I wrote to the ABYC (American Boat and Yacht Council), and their response was that there is no distinction between GFCI units used on boats or in houses.In short, DO NOT buy this Marinco item. Buy the LEVITON 7599-W instead (same thing) and save $30:Leviton 7599-W 15 Amp, 125 Volt Receptacle, 20 Amp Feed-Through, SmartlockPro GFCI, Wallplate and Screws Included, White"
4,A wandering mind,"There are many interesting poems in this book,and for Harfford fans,it is especially interesting how some of these poems eventually became the lyrics to some of John's better songs. I enjoy having this book as a way to remember John and explore a bit of his wandering mind and clever use of words."
1,Don Giovanni,"I purchase highlights of operas to be sure I make the right choice before purchasing the entire work. I won't be buying this version.I had great hopes and as much as I have loved these artists in the past, they don't suit my taste in this Don Giovanni. Sutherland is a stand-out, but I find the recording disjointed by solo work rather than ensemble. The conducting is good, but inconsistant and the sound is cloudy. It doesn't feel like a live performance, which my needs require for any opera recording."
3,Faith Facts for Young Catholics,"I thought there would be more different topics for the drills, there are probably only 7 topics and each topic has 3 or more different ways of using the drills. I do like the Flash card concept. We have went away from memorizing and it is another good tool to learn with."
5,Love it!!!,I got my dog from a pound that did not provide much care. I found nine ticks on him right after I got him...I used this to get everyone of them off. Much easier than tweezers!!!
5,Love them !,I had the tick twister and lost it.....and I looked all over for it because my horse had a tick never did find it so I used my tweezers.....What a joke !!!I got online and ordered 2 right away because nothing works as well or easy as this does. It works on people and animals I love them and wont be without it.
3,It's in my arsenal,"Looks sturdy, and I will try it on myself as soon as the opportunity arises:) Did not work so well on my poodle because the poodle hair got tangled in the twister."
2,Outdated,"I bought this book because I had read an awesome tale by the same author. Although the volume is interesting by itself (reproducing the original two-column format, with original illustrations), the stories themselves are quite boring and outdated."
1,This phone is horrible,Returnedthis phone a day after receiveng it. this unit has too much interference. as soon as you are a few feet away from the base unit you can not hear a thing. or best case if you do hear something it's mixed with various noises.this is my second Uniden phone and my last.
5,the excalibur soundtrack,I saw the excalibur movie in 1980 and loved it and the wagner music was very compelling.I bought vinyl soundtrack album that I wore out. During the cd era though this sound track became impossible to find. Now I have found this cd collection with the same conductor as on the soundtrack (Sir Adrian Boult) and it sounds exactly as I remember the soundtrack. Almost as a bonus there is other great music here just as compelling. (Lohengrin prelude to act1 and Tristan und Isolde prelude to act3 come immediately to mind) So if you loved the music to the 1980 movie Excalibur get this cd!
5,Great shaker,Perfect size and unlike previous shakers it doesn't leak. I have found it helps to give it a slight twist (like tightening a lid) to ensure it doesn't leak. Very happy with my purchase.
2,Leaks: malformed top,"I tried this shaker with water and I spilled some of it. Now, I'm a bit of an amateur with these things, so at first I thought I wasn't doing it properly. I tried shaking water a few times, on different days, and I always managed to spill some of it. Then I located the source of the leaks: the water was coming out from beneath the cap, and I could actually see that the top of the shaker was malformed: the cap was inserted ""deeper"" on one side than the other, and I couldn't do much about this. Since I don't want to make a mess every time I shake a martini (or shake it over the sink), I found this shaker effectively useless.To be honest, I don't understand why this shaker costs $22. It looks exactly like the $9 one at my local hardware store, which probably doesn't leak as badly."
1,Defective,"The shaker looks nice but I can't get the top off. Maybe if you have super-strength this would be the right product for you, but for us mere mortals it would be a good idea to get something else."
2,Disappointed,"When I received my package, I was very disappointed in the quality. There was a sticker on the bottom that said ""New,"" but the box was really beat up. My shaker had scratches on the outside of it, which looked really bad. But the worst part of all was that I couldn't open it. My roommates all tried, and I even put it in the freezer, hoping the metal would contract. However, I still couldn't get the lid off, so it's going back. It seems to be of high quality, except for that big issue."
3,Works well and looks nice but rusts easily.,"This seems like a quality shaker, works well, and doesn't leak... but I started noticing rust after a few uses!Make sure you dry it completely after use so it doesn't rust. For the price i'm not going to complain too much. Being stainless one would not expect it to rust so easily."
4,Great shaker for entertaining.,"We just added a wetbar to our basement and we always host parties for friends and family. People often ask for a specific drink and if we have the supplies, we will make it! But lots of friends were asking formartinis but our bar lacked a good shaker set. I bought this a few months ago and use it nearly every weekend. It cleans easily and is dish-washer safe. You should try this if you enjoy making drinks athome."
1,Not what they advertised,They said it was a Boston Shaker and it is not. Just a regular cocktail shaker. They did pay for the return.
1,could not get the lid off!,"Ordered two of these, one for me and one for a gift. Opened the first one, unable to get the lid off, no matter what hubby and I tried. Opened the other box, and still same problem, can't get that lid off either. Sending back for refund and ordering another type of shaker."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this item for an outdoor party and I wanted something inexpensive so if it didn't make it back or was damaged I wouldn't care. The shaker, however, did not make it to the party because it would not open. It is so tightly sealed that no one could pull it apart. Trying to return to seller. We'll see how that goes!"
1,Good Shaker but bad quality,"Bought this because of all the great reviews...forgot to look at the 1star reviews.the shaker was great in the beginning but after one use, I start to notice on the bottom of the exterior there's a ring of rusted edge.which isn't going away.. shaker is still use-able but not very appeasing to the eye. I would not recommend this."
1,"Very dissatisfied, will try to send back","Like other reviewers here (nursegardener), I received a faulty product--the lid does not come off. I should not have been sold this product and I am looking into returning it, which is a huge inconvenience for me."
3,Not Heavy Stainless,"I was disappointed in my premium cocktail shaker set because it is lightweight and leaks terrribly when shaking your drinks. I not only bought one, but I bought two so I'm doubly disappointed. I would recommend this product to someone who had never used a heavier martini shaker like the older one I own."
1,"Its parts stick, making it utterly useless","I bought this based on the mostly good reviews. I made ONE drink last night, and the cap stuck to the strainer. At first I couldn't pull the strainer off either, but at least I was finally able to pull that piece from the bottom piece -- BUT of course it had all the mixed ice etc. that was supposed to be strained. (I read someone's review in which he said he ran the top piece under warm water to get it off, but that didn't work at all for me.)It is now the next day and the top and strainer are STILL stuck. I am going to return this as I must have gotten a defective one -- at least, it doesn't work the way it's supposed to work. Not happy at all at wasting my money on this piece of crap.Are there any mixers out there with pieces THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER AFTER MIXING?!!"
3,Does the trick...,"Had shopped a few stores for a product like this and was not able to find it. Seems well made and the martinis that we enjoy are now shaken properly for home comsumption when the weekend arrives. Easy to clean and without leaking this product ""does the trick"". The cost is reasonable. Another good Amazon product!"
2,Nothing Premium,"There is nothing premium about this shaker. It is shiny so fingerprinte constantly smudge the outside. It is somewhat difficult to remove the top. But I suppose it would work for mixing which is what it is made for. I am returning this ""premium"" cocktail shaker and using the old 6 dollar one that I already had. I guess I had too high of expectations for a shaker, it is what it is. But It isn't worth 15 dollars."
4,Love it.,"This is the perfect size for 1- 3 people drinking. It looks great, and cleans easily; it also maintains its shine well. Sometimes the top is hard to get off, but if you use the technique of pushing up on the top with your thumbs instead of ""muscle-ing"" it, you should be fine."
3,Okay,"Nice shaker, I just expected it to be a little larger. It worked just fine, though. Other than that, okay"
4,"Lid Sticks a Little, but Overall Quality is Good.","I guess it is hit or miss with this Cocktail Shaker. Some people have trouble with it, other's haven't. As of yet, mine is just fine. Lid sticks a bit, but no rusting yet."
4,Leaks,This is nice but I do wish it had more of a grip when shaking cus it tends to leak on u. So I norm do it ovr the sink.
4,great to get drunk at last!,wonderful product. i could not give it the full 5 because of a few things mainly just a flaw in cocktail shakers in general though. when i shake it i need to have it on tightly. when i have it on tightly i can not get it off.. when i can not get it off i can not refill it...see where i am going with this? lolso i tried to lightly close it and spin it so it would mix and it worked until my mom grabs it from the top and spills ALLL MY VODKAH EVERY DAMN WHEREi cried that night.
1,Leaky,This is a good-looking shaker but it leaks when I shake it. I filled it up halfway the second try and it still leaked out everywhere from the top. I have to buy another one now and I'll pay more for better quality this time. Disappointing.
3,You get what you pay for,"Leaks a little, flimsy compared to my old one, and it's finish holds fingerprints like they'll be needed for something diabolical... Still, mostly worth the price when you're poor."
1,Dangerous item- pressure build up,"I have used many shakers in my day in both professional and home settings. I bought this shaker for my husband who wanted to try his hand at mixology. Not only does the top stick when you don't want it to (as other reviewers have noted) but the top SHOOTS off like a rocket when least expected. After shaking a drink vigorously, we have, on numerous occasions had the top burst off with a loud noise and land across the kitchen. Thankfully no one has been hurt, but we have yet to figure out why this top is so unpredictable.We do not recommend under any circumstances."
5,"Quick delivery, excited to give for Christmas",I can't wait to give this to my boyfriend for Christmas! He loves martinis so this is one of the best gifts I can give him. Came quickly and just as pictured for an excellent price!! Would recommend to all martini lovers!
2,Leaks,"We read the reviews and noted that some complained about leaking, so we immediately tested it out with some water. Yup, it leaked. Too bad, it was such a good price. You get what you pay for! We returned it and decided on one from Pottery Barn instead and are pleased with that."
5,Classy looking cocktail shaker,"Very nice. Adds a little class to the cocktail shaking process at parties, dinners, and whatnot. The stainless steel finish is very bright and clear; almost looks like polished silver. This is a classy little accessory. RJB."
2,"Doesn't look like picture, rusts immediately","Very disappointed. As some of the other reviewers noted, this thing rusts. I rinsed this out the day it was delivered intending to use it that night, and in the process of drying in a rack, the bottom began to rust in addition to the inside of the cap. This means that every time I use it, I need to wipe rust out of the shaker before making a drink. That's stupid and I strongly encourage you to NOT buy this.Also, the shaker doesn't look like the picture. I like the way it actually looks, but it's not shiny as the one that's shown, more off a matte finish (not sure if that can be applied to stainless steel, but you get my drift).On the plus side, it doesn't leak when shaking up a drink."
3,Funny :),"This movie is so lame! :) But you know what? That's okay, really! If you're looking for a fun family movie, check it out. It's very funny, and it's perfectly harmless. Sarah Michelle Gellar's part is pretty small, so you might be disappointed if you watch this video just because she's in it. The movie is about a family with a workaholic mom, a nice dad, and two kids, who are just trying to spend one evening relaxing. One thing after another goes wrong, and they end up on a deserted island . . . or is it really deserted? They build a really cool tree house, Sarah M. Gellar's character has a little romance, and the family fights the bad guys (who are kind of modern-day pirates). The film is not a re-make of the original Disney ""Swiss Family Robinson"", although there are some similarities. (I liked this one better than the old one.) Really, this movie is nothing to write home about, but it deserves points for its humorous antics."
1,This product contains lead,Do not buy this product. It contains lead as do several other Davinci labs product. Read the ingredient carefully. I would have given this product zero stars if that was an option.
1,Worthless!,"Over the years I've used some brand name and ""manufacturer compatible"" ink cartridges for all the printers I've had (mostly HP and Canon). These are unequivocally the most inconsistent and shortest lived ones I have ever bought. The last one I tried putting in literally printed 3 pages and then sputtered to death. Even at twice the cost, the Canon brand name cartridges print more than 6 pages each, and reliably so!"
2,Take it handly in your kitchen!!,"As an Italian girl, bored to eat always pasta and pizza, I was searching for a book teaching me how to bake scones: I once tried them in a lovely tearoom in Cornwall, UK, but they don't sell them in Italy. This book shows how to make them EXACTLY THE SAME I tasted them up there!!! And every recipe is clearly explained and easy and fast (very important for me, a working woman with two children!). I've got a new oven and my husband said that with this book he has to be jealous, because I spend all my time in my new kitchen! But I simply can't stop! Try page 26! Very tasty!! Thanks Mrs Wilson! (Only I was accostumed to weights in grams and not in ""cups"", but I easily got it with an English mug)."
3,works on small items,"I owned this APC inverter for over a year now. Mine does t e same thing, it beeps and shuts off after a while if the car is not running. thats a big pain in the neck because I drive a large commercial truck with multiple batteries so therew shouldnt be an issue. its only a laptop, common."
5,we believe,"my wife and i decided to take a trip to the casino the other day, well.... we lost our pants. i figured there really is no way to win against the big casinos. i'm telling you there really is and i believe it's in this book. the next week we came back to gamble once again, this time armed with a great book we found in a local book store. It' called Blackjack's hidden secrets For the first time we had a plan a..... goal. If you stick to this book and play the odds, you can really WIN.We have. Use this book and you can WIN for REAL too.Mr & Mrs J zdenek"
2,PIPER53,"If you take out the index,basic strategy chart, and the blackjackbasics, your left with a few pages of betting and theory. This ""book"" is only a quarter of an inch thick.I'd only recommend it to someone thinking about trying blackjackand had an extra 10 minutes to kill."
5,This Book Is Great,This book was great! It was easy to follow and I played for hours. I have never walked away from a Black Jack table with money in my pocket and never after 4 or 5 hours of playing.People at my table wanted to know what I was using and where could they get one. I won't go back to vegas without this book. I can't wait for my next visit to Vegas.
4,Good Prospective,"Hi...My mother first got this when i was about 14. I was touched on how good this was done by the actors. I am now 20 years old and i am living on my own, and this is a MUST HAVE. Too bad it's sold out on here becuase i would have bought this on here. Bruce has touched my life in many ways, and so has this film. Watch this for yourself and you yourself may incounter that the word of god is the most powerful words written in the world. Thanks visual bible!God's Blessings to all who seek the word of GodDavid"
5,The most human portrayal of Christ that I've seen!,"I thorougly enjoyed the Book of Matthew not only because it followed the NIV transalation word for word but the portrayal of Jesus was superb! I've never seen a more human example of Jesus Christ. He was playful, full of joy, and compassionate. This is a MUST SEE! The Falling Fire movie was also good but more of a dramatic portrayal than a word for word account."
2,An attempt to make Jesus more palatable,"Jesus smiles after just about everything he says - even when talking about hell and when rebuking the Pharisees! It seem the producers of this movie were uncomfortable with a Jesus who often made rather harsh statements. Instead of acting in concert with the text, the actor playing Jesus seeks to uphold an extra-biblical perception of Jesus that looks nothing like what a natural reading of Matthew would suggest."
2,"Inexcuseable, too many errors","I am currently reading this book and came on here because I spotted several errors in the text and wanted to see if anyone else had noticed this. I totally agree with a previous review that says the numerous errors will make you question everything. It is an interesting read, but it is just unforgiveable that even obvious things like plot points in films, casting, etc. are wrong. I noticed a few and let them go, thinking that I must be the one that was wrong. As it went on I thought wait a minute and started checking things out only to find that, in fact, they were wrong! Bad enough that the writer is irresponsible, but wasn't there a fact checker around?! As the other poster stated, when facts that are obvious and easily checked are wrong, it kind of ruins the readers experience and does have you wonder what else might be false. Inexcuseable."
3,half-and-half,"a little too much gossip, not enough real info.great stories about the behind-the-scenes, of getting these films made, of the struggles of the directors.but too much about parents, girlfriends, small stuff.so 2 1/2 stars actually, for the interesting stories."
4,Rebels On The Backlot,"While, by my definition, the directors here can hardly be considered rebellious, in Hollywood terms they certainly are. All fought the Hollywood machine. A machine that retreats from creativity, controversy and originality, always seeking the middle ground and, ultimately (all they really care about), profit. I was by no means an admirer of all the films here, but so fascinating are the accounts of their journey from idea to screen that I watched the films again in order to view them in a new light. This is an exhaustively researched and entertaining book. It's also full of juicy anecdotes and gossip (probably scurrilous). I think anyone interested in films and their tortuous journey to the cinema will enjoy it."
2,Fire the editor - you said it.,"I was going to write exactly what reviewer Howard Lamp has already commented on, so I encourage anyone planning on reading this book to consider Lamp's comments. If we can catch these rather larger errors in Waxman's book, why couldn't the people who were paid to catch them? And what about the author?For what it's worth, the book also features many grammatical errors."
4,Pretty good....,"Sharon Waxman delves into the lives of six men who have made headlines and redefined the way studios treat directors. Overall, what makes this book fascinating are the delicious details of personal lives and the on-the-set antics. However, what fail to shine is the actual writing. Waxman labors the half-baked introduction with lists of the directors' biographical landmarks that fail to make a point. The conclusion also feels rushed and bases her views of success on merely financial results (She dismisses ""Punch-Drunk Love"" as a failure for P.T. Anderson. He won Best Director for the film at both Cannes and Toronto Film Festivals.)I would still contest that this is a great read for those who have been captivated by these ""rebels"" and their extraordinary films, but if one is looking for any depth of analysis or crafted prose, look elsewhere."
2,A book for film geeks which needed a film geek editor,"Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times. Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling. Waxman badly needs an editor. She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function. Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry. Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative. But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly."
1,Very cute when not broken,I received one for Christmas. It came in a million pieces. Sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement. The tail was broken and not repairable. I'm very disappointed. I really wanted the dog but I probably won't go for a third try.
5,Love this Dog,"I love this dog digging in my Garden. Received many comments from neighbors and it looks so real.... Received it fast and well packed and it is a big part of my animal statues, I highly recommend it"
5,just darling,this is exactly as it looks in the picture. put it in my yard and it appears as though our terrier is digging in the dirt. very realistic. our dog began barking at it when she first saw it.
2,Broken!!,I gave it two stars because it was broken when I got it and inside the box the styrofoam was broken also. My only option was to get a refund even though a replacement would have been much better as this is a gift for someone else. I am worried about ordering another because it may arrive broken also.
2,not quite the usual fantasy,"There is no indication that this is only half a novel, but that's what it is. Usually a series of novels has a large story with each book being it's own standalone story. This book is not a standalone. It ends abruptly with a cliffhanger, there is no attempt at closure, there is only an attempt to get you to buy the next book. I wouldn't mind if they made that clear up front, so I wouldn't have wasted my money.Also having the narrator interacting with the story is a bit tacky, but that's just me, maybe some people like that."
4,Good deal for the money,"We ordered this UPS to replace our 10+ year old APC UPS. We are a small family owned company and wanted to save money, so we ordered the refurbished UPS. It arrived promptly, was easy to install and has worked great so far and is much quieter than our old UPS. I gave this 4 stars right now because I haven't seen how it holds up in daily use."
4,UPS for PC,"A fine unit. Works well, I have not ""lived"" with it long enough to know how it will be over the long-haul.The software for the Macintosh is very primitive but sufficient (Belkin's is much better.)The unit does not have any ""surge-protected only"" outlets, so you need a power-strip as well for your printer, etc."
1,Leaves us with no firm sense about the script,The book is more about Parpola's pet thesis that the Indian civilization is derivative to the Mesopotamian than about any real advance in the decipherment of the script. Parpola's thesis on the archaeological situation flies against the opinion of all the archaeologists and it is worthless.
2,just ok,"there really isnt anything special to this filter, as with most cameras you need to have the shutter open for a while with a really high iso setting, not to mention compensating the focus. in all honesty go spend the money on a converted camera, that way you dont have to spend 5 mins setting up your gear for a fuzzy photo. really not worth the money.ps if you are using this to see through clothing just know that it does not work except on very rare occasions and circumstances."
3,Garbage,"I do not recommend this filter. Total waste of time.Tutorials on the web, showing how to use an x-ray film tell you how to build your own IR filter and results are better."
5,No Contamination Here!,This one of the most well thought out and laid out book on this topic that you will ever find. Peariso covers all of the topics one would expect to find in a book such as this. Everything in this book is top notch from the charts to the everyday examples. I plan to purchase one of these for every manager in my plant. If you are concerned about food safety this is the book for you my friends...
1,Aging Today magazine,"I would love to be able to review the magazine but I ordered it Jan 11 and as of May 16 have not received a copy. If you are considering placing an order, you might want to re-consider. Have tried contacting publisher but no response."
5,GOOD!!!!,Very good book. I love diana palmer. she is one of the best authors out there. I love her books and will be buying more by her in the future.
3,"Great book, bad presentation","This classic book by G. Campbell Morgan has been a source of encouragement for several generations of Christians. Warren Wiersbe stated in On Earth as It Is in Heaven that it is one of the three books that were foundational to his Christian faith. Unfortunately, the digital presentation merits a rating of just about one star. There are many words that are incomplete, the text drops off in the middle of a sentence, and strange characters and boxes make it difficult to read. It would be wonderful if the text could be corrected and made more presentable. For now, the text available online at sites such as archive.org (which is the exact same book used for this digital copy) is much better."
2,great book - cheap printer,"This is a fantastic book and I have read it several times. I tried to purchase several copies for a couple friends recently. The shipping and the packaging were good; however, the books looked like they were printed with a bad copy machine that was about out of toner. Literally there are pages where the bottom two lines are not legible and the footnotes and scripture references at the bottom of the page are missing. Highly recommend the book, just find some other printer. Book would be 5 stars if not for the printing."
4,OK cap but does not keep water out of my ears.,REVISED REVIEW: I had no idea the cap is only intended to keep my head warm. I thought it was to keep water out of my ears. So it is a great cap but if you want your ears dry this is not the solution and not intended to be.
3,Okay but,"These recordings are okay. I'm not sure they are definitive in either sound or performance. I need to listen to others before I can throw rocks, tho. This is a listenable set and I like the ""Hebrew Themes"" which was one of the pieces that I was looking for."
5,Wow!,"Berof's performance of the 2nd Prokofiev piano concerto is one of the absolute most emotional performances I've ever heard. Amazingly, he isn't bogged down by the impossible notes--he sings the melodies, he listens to the harmonies, he fills the movements with personality, and he wrenches my gut with his cries for life. Of all of the several recordings of the Prokofiev 2nd piano concerto and the hundreds of other classical CD's I own, this is my personal favorite recording. If you haven't heard this concerto perfomed by Mr. Beroff, you are missing out on some of life's most human sounds. It will be one of the most moving recordings you will ever hear."
5,Great debut album!,"Too bad you can't get the CD from here anymore....but you will find yourself buying and downloading all the songs on this album...In the Midst of Malevolence"" by Dead Rites is an album you'll not soon forget... Radu is right up there with Pavarotti or Barry White, his deep sexy yet very metal vocals....he will haunt yer mind and move yer soul.....Dead Rites is a great metal/rock/gothic/punk band out of Georgia.The four cover songs on here very awesome!The other great songs were penned by themselves...showcasing their musical range from punk to rock to goth metal..."
3,interesting book,about literature before spain and shows what kind of people they were in mental sense of being
2,breaks easily....,So I bought these shoes as they fit MY personality PERFECTLY! THE DAY AFTER i bought & wore them the skull piece cracked COMPLETELY in half!?! I mean how crazy can you really get in this size of a shoe right? Well the shoes are WAY cute but quality is CRAP!!!
5,memories of a child,it reminds me of some great times as a boy . ispent hrs with this mans music he was so alive and so real for us as children.victor hart.
1,uglyuglyuglyuglyugly,Why oh WHY did they make them grow up? Now they are creepy. :'( Bring back the babies!
3,Still trying,"Although ""unique""--as one professional reviewer put it--that doesn't necessarily mean a brilliantly conceived book will be enjoyable. I started, but didn't get very far, so far. The style is opaque with trendy deconstructionist jargon that must first be deciphered into plain English (this is serious sociology, after all). Understanding Wright's own words can be difficult, true, but fun. This is not, so far. (Contrast the fresh air quality of the opening Wright passage with Satler's ponderous text.) Although the book title speaks of ""Living Space,"" note that this book focuses on Wright's early WORK spaces (Larkin and Unity Temple) rather than his houses. Nor are the tiny B/W pictures of those buildings either plentiful or good. I hope to come back to this book after enjoying some others (e.g., G. Hildebrand's The Wright Space [Univ. Washington], or Susan Bandes' Affordable Dreams: The Goetsch-Winckler House [Kresge Art Museum, Michigan State Univ])."
4,A readable instruction book,"The poor excuse for an instruction manual provided with the excellent Treo 650 is so ""non-user-friendly"" (very small, gray type, dense copy) that I bought his book as a ""substitute manual""The book is a readable, inviting, instruction manual. All the information in it is buried somewhere in the supplied (free)factory manual but this book avoid eyestrain and frustration. That was worth it for me."
2,Not worth buying,This was a waste of money. You can get the same info on the internet. Short and sweet... don't do it!
4,Makes Sense to Me,"Amazing! But believable. Isn't it every man's fantasy to have a ... slave. I could not give it 5 stars because the Biblical quotes were a bit too much. I admire Brice's courage in telling her story. It is unfortunate that she did not have a proofreader for her book as there are a lot of grammatical errors which are somewhat annoying. Nevertheless, it's an interesting read all right."
4,Makes Sense to Me,"Amazing! But believable. Isn't it every man's fantasy to have a sex slave. I could not give it 5 stars because the Biblical quotes were a bit too much. I admire Brice's courage in telling her story. It is unfortunate that she did not have a proofreader for her book as there are a lot of grammatical errors which are somewhat annoying. Nevertheless, it's an interesting read all right."
1,A Poor Fantasy Derived from a Crazy Woman,"This book is way too weird to be true. She names all these famous singers, actors, and politicians, and knows that she was sent in to all these highly sensitive areas (such as the Pentagon), but didn't name ONE piece of material she was made to memorize. If she really risked her life to name all these people (as she claims)why not tell all? Sorry to say, but it sounds like a weird story constructed out of pure fantasy by someone who really is crazy."
5,NO MORE DENIAL!,"Depending upon the level of abuse one has endured, this book apparently has it all. Finally, the truth has come out about how our country is run and how those in power get there and what they do to people to stay there. I commend Brice and her therapists for spreading the truth and helping set others free from ritual abuse. A must for any psychotherapist and any minister who counsels with abuse issues."
1,Great to see the paranoids coming out of the woodwork!,"David Icke is of course the British soccer announcer turned Messiah currently poisoning the minds of the gullible and borderline paranoids worldwide. Brice Taylor is his handpicked poster girl, a sad basket case who has chipped in to help Icke disseminate his lunatic ravings about global conspiracies, alien invasion, and other nonsense garnered from pop culture films like ""The Matrix"" and ""They Live"".This kind of garbage is well-timed to say the least, the biggest global conspiracy of all being the knee-jerk anti-authoritarianism, anti-Americanism and ignorant superstition that festers in the imagination of ill-educated young people worldwide. And, sadly, not so young people who ought to have developed the plain common sense to know better. Disgusting, slanderous, libelous, ludicrous, insane claptrap."
1,"If you are a loony, you might like this book.","I think it is one of the worst written, far-fetched, piece of complete and total junk-and that's being kind. This woman is obviously nuts and making the whole thing up. If you believe the National Enquirer, you may be gullible enough to fall for it, but I think it's one of the worst books out there."
5,Great for protecting a home system.,"This is my second APC UPS. I previously had the 500va model. If you need a good UPS for protecting a home system, this should suit your needs.What can I say about it? It works the way it's supposed to, and that's what matters. Well-built, reliable, and effective. In the years I've had my UPSs I've had power outages, brownouts, fluctuations, and my computer has never been affected.Keep in mind that this (and all UPSs) are heavy, due to the internal battery, which is pretty beefy.I've had need to contact APC on occasion, and they've been responsive and helpful."
5,Works very well,"Well made quality equipment. You don't have much work time with it, but it keeps your computer from going down on power blinks. You have time to close all programs on longer outages. If you want more time, buy a larger unit."
1,Doesn't even work,"Bought it a month before I needed it because I am proactive, which is why Beach Audio will not allow me to return it. If I were you I would go with a larger more reputable company or open what you order immediately because you won't get a refund if it doesn't function"
5,OSP 10,"This is without a doubt one of the top five movies of all time. The acting is superb and the movie keeps you interested through out. Gary Cooper is brilliant, but the actress who plays Mother York, Margaret Wycherly, steals the show. I have seen this movie several times in my lifetime and I become deeply engrossed everytime I watch it. This is one of the best bargains ($10.99) you will ever find for a DVD. The second DVD, Sergeant York: An American Hero is also outstanding as well. This is definitely a must see movie. They definitely don't make movies like tis one in this day and age."
5,Sgt. York DVD,"This is a great film. My husband loves it, he watched it the night he recieved it. Thanks for carrying these old film."
5,A War Classic,"It's difficult to imagine any collector of war-based films not having this one on the shelf or in the DVD tray. It is the true story of Alvin York, one of America's greatest war heros and patriots. While the actual combat scenes are limited, when compared to the overall length of the film, it is a most powerful WWI story of a conscientious objector's battle with balancing his faith against his need to perform as a soldier. I cannot think of an actor from that era who would have been more effective in the role than Gary Cooper, who was at his best in this touching film"
5,Sargent York,"Amazon was the only place I could get this movie, fast service, my husband was thrilled to receive this movie."
5,Give me that old time religion!,"Gary Cooper's first Academy Award winning performance (his other award was earned from ""High Noon"") is in one of the most memorable films to come out of Hollywood. World War I had been one of the most unpopular wars ever fought by the United States. Even though President Woodrow Wilson promised to keep the country out of the war, the pressures to enter were just too great. Even near the war's conclusion in 1918, uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict was quite prevalent; the United States was in need of a hero to keep the morale up. This film is based on the true life story of Alvin York, a Tennessee native who at first objected to his induction into the army due to religious beliefs. This gifted sharpshooter played a significant role in helping to win the war for the Allies. This film has everything needed to be a cinematic classic whose popularity will endure for generations to come."
4,Sergent York,Of course I am a fan of Gary Cooper regardless of the role he plays. This is a bit of history along with great acting by all cast members.
5,A Classic that should be in Every Collection.,"Excellent depiction of values,family,God and Country.A time walk through all phases of life in an honest way.the bonus footages and the stories told. are well worth the price if the movie was sold seperatly .. love it"
5,Classic,Had this movie for years Worn out the VHS. Glad to see SGT. York in DVD. Great history and so true to his real story. After seeing movie visited his home in Tenn . THe second special DVD in set tells the long history of the movie. If you like the movie get the set. Great.
5,More than just a war movie,"Sergeant York tells the true story of Alvin York - a man whose many transitions in life culminate in a Medal of Honor for service in World War 1. He starts as an alcoholic and streetfighter, who has developed great rifle skills while hunting. Along the way he finds religeon, love and pacifism. Despite the last, he is called to serve his country, and struggles with moral challenges of war.The movie is not a typical war movie by today's standards. It takes 70 minutes to get to where he's drafted. The preliminary scenes are more about his transitions in life, and struggle to make something of himself. The climax is the war scene that makes him a legend. It captures the ugliness of war without the modern technology used to make movies today. (Certainly not a Private Ryan movie)Outstanding story of heroism, and the moral conflicts of war. The messages of the story resonate today, perhaps with just a little too much irony."
5,Great Family Movie!,This movie is enjoyable for the entire family. I had my cell group over for a movie night and young and old enjoyed it alike.
5,Common man becomes war hero.,A movie about overcoming impossible odds. Gary Cooper plays the role of a perfect gentleman and hero. Mister Cooper had a screen presence that cannot be matched. His acting skills can reach out to anyone and let you live in the moment. This great movie can be a true inspiration.
5,The Nearly 2 1/2 Hours Swooshed Right By!,"This film is so indulging and influential. It tells the true story of a giant American hero. All the necessary elements nedded to make a spectcular picture are right here! Watch this one with your entire family. Also equally recommended is ""High Noon"" and ""Mr. Deeds Goes To Town."" I just love Gary Cooper!"
5,Courage Defined!,"Gary Cooper in one of his finest performances in a long and brilliant movie career. ""Alvin York"" is truly an inspirational story for all Americans. All of us at one time or another have wondered if ""we were called to duty"" how we would respond. Gary Cooper gives the type of response that we all hope and pray that we could give if placed in a similar situation. Gary Cooper defines the word ""courage""."
5,An excellent study of man overcoming his own weaknesses.,"This film is a remarkable story of man's struggle to serve both God and Country. He excels at both without giving up on either. The impacts of supporting characters on Alvin York are the true gems in this film - his mother, his pastor and his commanding officer all play roles in shaping his character. Yet all the while he remains faithful to himself and God."
5,An America That Is Long Gone,"The acting, casting, and directing in this film are perfect for the storyline. This is a movie about one man's struggle to strike a balance between his commitment to God and his patriotism to his country. He ultimately proves that both can be achieved without compromise to either.This is the TRUE story about an American hero and how he rose from obscurity as a Tennessee hillbilly farmer to a national icon. Truly an inspirational film for the whole family.Cooper and Brennan are fantastic! Joan Leslie is also great."
3,"Not just your average ""gung-ho"" war film.","Gary Cooper gives an Academy Award-winning performance (Best Actor, 1941) as Sergeant Alvin C. York, a Tennessee hell-raiser-turned-pacifist Christian-turned-war hero. York's journey toward immortality (he won the Medal of Honor for his actions in France) began with a drunken brawl in a Kentucky tavern, and ended when he single-handedly captured 132 German soldiers on the fields of Flanders during World War I.The acting in ""Sergeant York"" is fabulous. Cooper is simply superb as the reticent, conscience-stricken York. He is ably supported by Walter Brennan as his pastor, Rosier Pile; and Joan Leslie as his girlfriend Gracie.""Sergeant York"" is much more than just a ""gung-ho"" war film; it explores with great sensitivity and relevance (even by today's standards) the eternal human conflict between personal beliefs and public responsibilities. In my book, this will always rank as one of the greatest films ever to come out of Hollywood."
5,Sargent York,Sargent York has got to be one of the best movies in history. Gary Cooper does a wonderful job portraying Alvin York. Sometimes biographies can be boring but this movie tells his story in a great way.
5,Sergent York wins a Medal again,"Sergent York, was a real American hero who did it for his country during WW1 . His amazing story unfolds here in my state of Tennessee in a small town called Pallmall in northern east Tennessee. His exploits are enjoyed by thousands as he went to war and was against killing as the Bible teaches.He actually killed to save lives and singlehandled captured 132 Germans and was exclaimed a hero and decorated for it.It is a great movie by Gary Cooper and Walter Brennen. Also June Lockheart ( Lassie Fame) played Alvins sister.It's a piece of history you will want to see over and over."
3,review regarding movie Sgt. York,"I ordered the movie Sgt. York not realizing it was the black and white version. We saw the colorized version on TV and wanted it. It was our mistake by ordering the one advertised and returned it for a refund. We can't find the colorized version but would love to have it. If ever available we want to purchase it. Can you put a request on file? If not, we will continue to search for it. Thank you. Joann Hefner"
4,Sergeant York DVD,"Listing in Special Features on the back of the DVD package, it states as included:Commentary by Film Historian Jeanine Basinger - check2 insightful documentaries: New Making-of - checkFeaturette - Sergeant Your: Of God and Country and Vintage Biographical Profile - checkGary Cooper: American Life, American Legend - checkClassic cartoon: Porky's Preview - not there - we were looking forward to that"
2,SERGEANT YORK,The reason for the rateing is that I thought that this movie came in color and when it arrived to my home it was in black and white. Cna someone there tell me does this come in color as while if so please give me a price. Other then that I really enjoyed the movie.
1,Horrible!,"I just can't understand why everyone liked this film so much? I HATED THIS FILM, This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. UGH! I don't think that the acting is good, It's stinks.The woman who played as York's wife is too old to play the part. I got confused and though that was his mother until someone tell me it wasn't.This movie is too long, and there are alot of parts that they should leave out. All of the parts where they are getting druck in a bar. That a waste and it's makes the film long and boring.Mostly all of the acting is just plain silly, I laugn at this movie. This film is a big disappointment. I can make a much better film than this one.If you want to watch a good war movie watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" and stay away from ""Sergeant York""."
4,One for the ages,"Sergeant York (Two-Disc Special Edition)Even though there have been a number of reviews I felt I needed to add my voice. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because some of the acting is not ""top of the line."" That being said it is one of my favorite movies of all time. This film represents beautifully the inner conflict of a man whose life has been radically changed by an encounter with Jesus Christ and who takes what he has been reading in the Bible very seriously and yet is called upon to serve his country in a way that seems (to him) contradictory. While he presents an example of a conscientious objector that perplexes his commanders, he struggles through this dilemma to a place of living out these dual roles. The portrayal of Alvin York's humility is done superbly by Gary Cooper. A wonderful film."
5,Cooper at his best!,"This is one of my favorite all time classics. The true story of hillbilly sharp shooter and hellion Alvin York turned pacificst, then WWI hero.Gary Cooper is magnificent and natural who's presence commands the screen with a great supporting cast as well.Even non war film fans will enjoy this story.Fact: Alvin York refused to sign the rights to his story until W.B. promised that Cooper would play his part."
4,I like it,Viewed this movie a while ago and it was great movie back then and it is a great movie now.
5,Amazing,"I wont say many things but this is just an advice for those who long for real music. Let's forget all the bad hits today and listen to the greatest ever band on earth. When I heard Always I couldnt believe that it is manly made. It is something I cant describe. The words, the music, all the thing is great. So rush to the nearest CD store and buy this great one from the great Bon jovi"
5,The Greatest,I have got most of his records and cds but I just carn't stop listing to them all in turn when i'm depressed but when i'm realy depressed I listen to my fravourite one These Days. I have never heard such a good singer his voice realy gets my heart pumping and the words to most of his songs mean something. I realy like his new one (life like this) and I hope to have it in my collection soon. Some of todays new singers just don't capture our imagnation and leave us wanting more. They don't even realy know how to sing .
3,The only way to listen to Bon Jovi,"Bon Jovi, like so many other hair bands of the late '80's has this problem with solid albums. You get a few good singles from each album and the rest leaves you with a bad taste. This ""best of"" works for me. No fillers, just the meat. Only song I can think of that sould have been on this ""best of"" but is not would be ""Born to be my baby!"" So I'll keep the ""New Jersey"" CD in my collection for that classic. Other than that this CD has the bases covered."
2,Poor quality,"Cross Road is a great soundtrack, but the quality of the CD is terrible. A couple tracks skip and I'd like to get my money back."
4,Rocks out,"I was never a Bon Jovi fan in the past. I'd heard some of their songs, but I was past my AC listening stage. I bought this for the fetching Mrs. because she said she liked them. I found this ""best of"" CD to be very enjoyable, from the perspectves of listener or musician. Richie Sambora is a very good guitarist, and I like his work."
4,The Best,"I think that this is the best album of JBJ's. I love it! I am sure that a lot of ppl agree because when of these songs come on in the bar everyone knows the words. The mix if wicked slow songs and fast songs. Some of my faves are: Always, You Give Love a Bad Name, Bed of Roses, and Bad Medicine.Peace...if you dont got it, then WHY!!??????"
4,Masterful Assorment Of Timeless Music.,"Bon Jovi were one of the best hard rock bands to come out the80's and their legacy to music is captured. Even though they arestill around today and still sound good i don't think they havethe same type of rock enthusiuasim they once propelled. But stillwhen you take a listen to CROSS ROAD and hear songs like""Livin On A Prayer"" ""Bad Medicene"" ""In & Out Of Love"" It's toohard to forget the impact that Bon Jovi made on contempory music."
5,THIS CD ROCKS,"I completely love this CD! Some of the songs are without much beat, or they are too long, but my all time favorites are Living On A Prayer, Keep The Faith, Always, Lay Your Hands On Me, U Give Love A Bad Name, Bad Medicine, Runaway and In & Out Of Love. Bon Jovi has very good lyrics and the whole album has a very good rock quality! Buy the CD, it is a must-have for any Bon Jovi fan!"
5,Great start for a Bon Jovi collection.,"I bought Cross Road because I'd heard some of the songs when my brothers played them and knew ""Bed of Roses"" from school dances. I never expected to love the CD as much as I did--this was the first CD case I ever wore the hinge down on so that it didn't stop opening at 180 degrees.Granted, the album didn't have every single pre-1994 Bon Jovi hit on it, but I don't think that means that the casual listener or even the hardcore Bon Jovi fan can't enjoy listening. There's a great selection of songs here."
4,Couple Songs Short...,"Ok we all know that ""Never Say Goodbye"",""Born To Be My Baby"",and ""Living In Sin"" are missing.....damn it sucks.But when putting a greatest hits together like this you can't be to picky.Maybe they will release a newer hits or essential package later that will have them on it.Its alright for the casual fan.At least they put two songs from their older albums here."
4,The best to date of Bon Jovi,"I'm not typically a Bon Jovi fan. In fact this is the first album of his I bought. I ranked it four stars because of that reasoning. But to attest to how good this album is, I had a Japanese exchange student living with us who is a huge Bon Jovi fan so when I let him listen to Cross Roads he stated definetly that this was his best music. Personal favorites include Always, You Give Love A Bad Name, and Lay Your Hands On Me. I strongly recommend to all Jovi fans to buy it, and for those of you who aren't (including me) you wouldn't be a bit sorry to purchase it."
4,Good News and Bad,"""Crossroads"" is your one-stop shop if all you want is Bon Jovi's hit songs (and a couple new hits thrown in for fun.) They're all here in their original glory. Here's the problem: Bon Jovi is one of those bands whose truly great songs were never released. It's songs like ""Wild in the Streets,"" ""Blood On Blood,"" ""Silent Night,"" and ""I'd Die For You"" that make this band more than just the faces you see on MTV. ""Crossroads"" misses that point. But it misses most of what makes Bon Jovi great. Unfortunately, a lot of people will think this is all of what makes them great, and that's sad. So go buy the rest of the records and listen to ""Wild is the Wind"" or ""Dry County"" for a real dose of a great rock and roll band."
2,three strings and a few good songs,"three chord hair band with a few good songs but way over the top hype.wanted dead or alive,you give love a bad name you know the good stuff and maybe two more songs the rest just like there music careers is filler."
2,it falls short of the glory. . .,"it's a typical hits cd in the way that it excludes some gems. it's missing ""edge of a broken heart"" and ""she don't know me"" which makes it a shame but not a total, pitiful shame."
1,Bon Jovi Crossroads CD,"There was a Jazz CD, in the case, not Bon Jovi.Since I did not pay much, did not make a fuss, but disappointed."
1,'Tis The Christmas Shopping Season....,"Let's do over what we all ready done but with a twist. It surely will sell well and kill another one of those requirements with the record company. We'll make money, the record company will make money and we won't have to do alot of work! Ain't Amercia grand.......Fantastic band...bad idea...don't bother!"
1,"If you hate music, then you'll LOVE Bon Jovi.","This is what happens, auditorally, when you combine guitars with hairspray. And the ""happening"" ain't good. This is the ultimate representation of the dreck produced during the 1980's - an era where talent and musicanship took a backseat to appearance and trivialities.If you're reading this, then you need to dig deeper into some of the better musical offerings of the decade; good music could be found, you just had to search a tad harder.Throw out your leftover Aqua-Net and spandex."
3,ADD 3 songs....REMASTER,"Adding a few more songs would be nice, RE-release the album...maybe remaster. Without songs like "" BORN TO BE MY BABY"" etc., there really isn't any great JOVI hits. There are easily a couple of other good tracks from SLIPPERY WHEN WET, that could go on this HITS collection, even NEW JERSEY. BUT PLEASE NO demos, or LIVE TRACKS. Those destroy hits collections.This album is way to short for the CD world, not for cassettes but deffently short for a hits collection. Hits VOL. 2, is rumored for fall of 2009. This is what worries me. BOUNCE, the album, was really bad...AND I KNOW ,the jovi camp will stick those crappy songs on the set list."
4,Great - but could be better,"They really could have put a few more songs on this one. Born to be my baby, living in sin, in these arms... wild in the streets... I'd die for you... just to name a couple. HeadbangerDuh should bang his head without the duh... POP music is short for whats ""popular""...""Hair metal"" had nothing to do with metal - just the hair. motley crue and poison were popular back than - so what made em metal? Anything thats top 40 is ""POP"" music."
4,"Great starter for a Bon Jovi collection, but needs a pt. 2","Cross Road is a 14 track (11 previously released) Greatest Hits collection Bon Jovi released in 1994. The album was a huge success and gave them one of their biggest singles, Always.The bulk of the album focuses on Bon Jovi's peak in popularity, roughly 1986-1990. With Slippery When Wet and New Jersey, Bon Jovi were one of the top hard rock bands of the late 1980's. 3 tracks off each album.With Cross Road, you can get the biggest of the big Bon Jovi hits from 84-94 on one package, prepare to ride on the steel horse or be shot down in a blaze of glory whenever you wish to be.However, I think it's time for a Cross Road 2. Bon Jovi's had quite a few hits since this album, and they can put in some of the ""missing"" hits off this album, such as the #3 Born To Be My Baby, the #9 Living In Sin, the radio smash Never Say Goodbye, the top 20 In These Arms, and others."
4,my husband likes it.,"bought this for my husband. he likes it. i like bon jovi, but i tend to go for his newer music, he has mellowed out some. still sounds great, but not so much what i call ""headache"" music!"
3,Jocelyn B Smith has THE voice,"Jocelyn B Smith, a singer living in Germany, has one of the most beautiful soul voices you can imagine. She has several albums out in Germany, but is rather unkown outside of German borders. Here she sings the German versions of Elton John's ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""Circle of life"". Unfortunately I like only these two songs of this album - so only 3 stars :)"
4,"Excellent content in the book, although it's well worn","I bought this hard to find book, because it's by Barbara Walters, the best interviewer of all interviewers. She has successfully interviewed many people who will not give interviews to other interviewers. Her compassion enables her to ask personal questions that people do not want to answer, and she is successful where others are not. Her tips listed in this book will help anyone to learn how to talk to just about anyone, just as the title implies. This book is a used paperback and is not being published any more. It was last printed in 1975 with a listed price of $1.50, but it cost much more than that when I bought it, and it is well worth the present day price."
1,Really dated,"Couldn't get through this book. Style reminded me of a wanna-be Bronte: brooding, heavy, unrelentingly dark. Quite dismal, and I love period fiction."
5,One of the best,"I have read this book at least three times,it's that great. Everyone feels the same way after reading it. Janna is such a strong woman. Every woman should read it, men also, it's that entertaining."
5,Try it! You won't be disappointed,"This is without a doubt one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. If you like a good yarn and the kind of book that you just can't put down, read Penmarric."
5,An Inspiring Story that Teaches Powerful Lessons,"This is a unique guide to finding the love you want!! Unlike other self-help books, Dr. Kirschner shares her expertise with us through an engaging narrative with characters who are familiar & inspiring to us at the same time. After reading this I thought, ""If she (the main character) can find her way to real love I can do it, too!"""
4,"Informative, eye-opening view of the psychedelic experience","Huston and Masters give a well detailed and extremely fair minded account of the psychedelic experience, primarily via LSD sessions that were recorded by observers who were trained in psychology. The book covers the myriad aspects of ""the trip"" from perceptions of the human body to the deep religious experience.The book is somewhat more scholarly than the works of someone like Timothy Leary but this is what is needed if this movement is to ever regain its legitimacy in the eyes of the general public. While it does not condone the illegal use of the drugs, it decries their suppression and the utter halt of legitimate research into these fascinating and important substances. Read it with an open mind, but remember that the drugs are illegal and therefore also potentially dangerous. That aside, the book will almost certainly spark your curiousity."
4,"Great strips, OK book","9 Chickweed Lane has been a favorite comic strip for some time. Brooke McEldowney uses heavy lines and negative spaces to capture a unique atmosphere. These strips about Solange, the family cat, and her feline quirks are some of the best and emphasize McEldowny's graphic skills over dialogue.Unfortunately, the book's addition of heavily using pink to highlight the otherwise black and white comics detracts greatly from his artwork. A book in the same format as Mutts, Fox Trot, or Calvin & Hobbes would have been much preferred over this special-format book. And I hope that 9 Chickweed eventually gets such a collection."
2,Hallmarks of Felinity,"""9 Chickweed Lane"" is often the funniest -- and always the most beautiful -- comic strip in the daily paper. It's the first thing I look for every morning. This tiny, tiny book is disappointing not for what it includes, but for what it leaves out. I want a collection that adequately represents the remarkable depth, beauty, grace, and wit of McEldowney's work. ""Hallmarks of Felinity"", with its small handful of Solange strips, simply fails to deliver."
4,Covers the silly and serious nature of the feline,"This book does well in capturing the essence of the cat. Any cat lover would appreciate this book as a gift.Brooke McEldowney (who is a man, by the way) has great talent- and I can only hope to see a comprehensive 9 Chickweed Lane book in the future.Other fan of McEldowney's work should be sure to look for his other comic strip: Pibgorn"
5,Perfect,"I heard Corb Lund described as Canada's answer to Cake, but that's not really true. The Corb Lund band is as rooted in Alberta as Cake is in California, and both have smart lyrics, but (even though I don't much like country music) I have to give the nod to this album. Great musical hooks, wonderful lyrics, songs that get stuck in your head and make you smile for days afterward.I think I'd compare Corb Lund more to Steve Earle, with a catchier bass/banjo line. BRILLIANT album."
5,Pure Alberta Country !,"I was in Canada this weekend and heard the 'The Truck Got Stuck"" and I was hooked. I bought the CD and laughed and smiled from the beginning until the end. Buy this CD and ENJOY!"
4,Great ring..,It's beautiful. It's clean and It looks great. I would of course rather buy http://amzn.to/fsGM7V but considering the cost this is not bad at all :)
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in the aring.. I thought it was going to show the crystal stones better. I would not get another one nor would I tell anyone to purchase this ring
3,cubic ring,"Looks nice, but very uncomfortable wearing. Worth it the inexpensive price if you are wearing it for short periods of time."
4,Growing on me.,"I got two to wear on either side of my 5mm yellow gold wedding band with a 1.3 karat round stone mounted on it. Just wanted a different look than my channel set diamond bands that I have worn on either side for years. At first, I thought the pave bands were too much, and took away from the solitare. I decided to wear them over the weekend with my wedding ring, and now I like them. I have received compliments as well. At first, they felt bulky compared to my other anniversary bands, but now I am used to them and they are comfortable. I am happy with the purchase. A totally different look at a very affordable price. They look much more expensive than they are."
4,Ring,Wish this ring would come in 1/2 sizes really needed a 6 1/2 very well made was happy with this purchase
5,Love it!,"Just got this ring, and I absolutely love it! We had an accident with my wedding band and the garbage disposal (wedding band lost), so this is my 'replacement' band until I get a new one made later this year. Wanted something in sterling silver so the color wouldn't turn, and LOVE the look of pave diamonds.It really sparkles, and would definitely make a great wedding band (who CARES if it's not real diamonds!)"
5,This ring is gorgeous!,"Wow, this ring sparkles more than I expected! It truly is beautiful and for me I don't mind wearing cubic zirconia so this is perfect. Really a great piece of jewelry for a really good price."
2,Not so great,"I thought the picture looked good, but I didn't like the ring very much once I saw it in person. It's also not very comfortable to wear."
3,pretty but a little rough,small but sparkly stones but is definitely rough and a little hard to wear all day. makes a nice party or evening ring.
5,Neve's Journey to herself...,"This movie is not a typical comedy or suspense thriller that Neve usually stars in. It's more of a down to earth, ""real life"" flick, one that inspires personal growth and encourages adventure. Neve is an adorable free spirit who is doing some soul searching. She has a mystical ora, a realness about her in this film. Very different from the others she's done. If you're a REAL NEVE CAMPBELL FAN, this one is not to be missed."
3,INTERESTING LOOK INSIDE THE LIFE OF THE KING OF 'B' MOVIES,"Well done but comes down to the wire DULL (to be honest this is the first full book i've read that wasn't a children's book or a review book by roger ebert,leonard maltin or videohound or a book on must see movies) i bought this bookbecause i'm working on a movie about a corman-like figure,as i was reading iti sometimes wish that roger corman & jim jerome made a documentary adaptation of their book (which dosen't seem like a bad idea to me!) it's dull but otherwise not bad as it has more then enough interesting parts leonard maltin said ontv that 'bowfinger' had parts that were stronger than the whole,that's how i feelabout ""how i made a hundred movies in hollywood and never lost a dime"" i offically recommend it,in spite of the fact that it's dull offical verdict:thumbs up"
4,Good book from the king of Trash,"First, this is really a 1990 book, and all information pertains to 1988 and prior. I enjoy exploitation films and this book adds to my enjoyment. Many films today are boring and darkly filmed. Just a bunch of special effects done on a computer. It's nice to know that many of Roger Corman films are still available. Maybe not at you local Wal Mart, but they do appear on TV occasionally. This book provides information to further my appreciation of what Roger Corman was able to accomplish during his life-time. Well through 1988, anyway."
4,Wonderful Western!,"This is a great family western that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Little kids will love it and the older people will enjoy reminiscing about when it was live on television. Packed with action, adventure and good clean fun, Laramie is one western you don't want to miss."
4,westerns,there is so much junk on tv now that I always go back to the westerns.good clean no gays no bad words.
2,Is it just me...,"Okay, so I've tried several Timeless Media titles, some of my favorite western series (+ M Squad) from my childhood, and I've read all these good reviews about the transfers. Am I missing something here? These are poor transfers. Okay, I've not watched every single episode of each series Timeless has released, but I've watched a few from each series I've gotten (The Texan, The Restless Gun, M Squad, Laramie) and I'm just not going to do it anymore. These guys do it on the cheap and, forgive me for being a cynic, but those reviewers who praise the transfers are either employed by Timeless or are getting kickbacks. Even Warner Archive has done better transfers with the made-to-order DVDs. It's a d--n shame these great series get such a lousy treatment."
4,Good dvd,Great TV classic. Wonderful western theme. Wholesome viewing. The video case was damaged but the discs themselves were fine. Recommend for family viewing.
4,LOVE OLD WESTERNS,"Content of this video was good, but the picture was not as clear as some we have purchased. was a little light. Do like Robert Fuller in the lead role."
1,APC SUA1500 1500VA Smart UPS for Servers,"Hols charge - but product does not do what it says it will do, notification software does not work to email or call you if power goes down."
4,A nice Wayne/Ford collaboration,"A lesser-known John Ford western, featuring John Wayne, Pedro Almendariz and Harry Carey, Jr., son of the great silent western actor, Harry Carey, to whom Ford dedicated this feature. The three are an affectionate trio of would-be bankrobbers whose big heist goes kaflooey when they find themselves trapped without water in the Arizona desert with a posse on their trail. The story takes a comedic twist after the desperados are made guardians of a dying woman's newborn son. This ""three banditos and a baby"" plot had been filmed several times before (and survived intact in other genres later on...) but it still has its charms. Ford's direction is typically solid and entertaining, and Wayne is pretty much at his physical and charismatic peak. Fun film -- not great, but a nice afternoon oater."
3,"Enjoyable, but no classic","Three Godfathers is memorable mostly due to its character actors and the cinematography rather than the script and 3 leads. It's an interesting story that's been done numerous times, and is always watchable, but unless you're a hardcore Wayne fan, it's nothing special. Worth watching, not owning. BTW. to the one poster who gave mini bios on practically everyone connected with the film... that's nice, but what did you actually think of the movie itself?"
4,3 Godfathers Review,I enjoyed the movie very much but a few scenes ran a little long. John Wayne was excellent. It was diffent from traditional Christmas movie but it left you with the same feeling of joy at the conclusion.
4,"""Three Kings"" move over!","Looks like the ""Three Kings,"" which was advertised as the best original screenplay of 1999, resembles the ""Three Godfathers.""Wayne (Clooney) and his outlaw friends (Kings' soliders) get greedy, steal gold, and flee into the desert. Along the way they become the ""godfathers"" of a dying woman's baby (abandoned Iraqi rebels). They then get a conscience and realize they need to throw away their plans in order to save the baby (back to ""Kings"" abandoned Iraqi rebels). So some of the outlaws (soldiers) unfortunately die along they way.""Three Kings"" is a nice movie but give credit where credit is due. You just can't beat the Duke and John Ford! Ford and the Duke did give credit to the past film versions. They even dedicated ""Godfathers"" to the original star of the silent film version.Get the ""Three Godfathers."" You'll love it!"
4,3 Godfathers,"I first saw this on TV years ago and always looked forward to seeing it when televised but unfortunately it is rare as it is a lesser known movie by the Duke. Fans of John Wayne may know of it but if not it is a must see. John Ford does an excellent job directing, the cast includes many of the Wayne favorites, and the story is compelling and funny at times. The cinematography is beautiful. The desert scenes are remarkable as in all Ford directed movies. I recommend you at least rent it and if you are a Wayne fan as I am you will want to own it as you will rarely see it otherwise. Good quality DVD. If you enjoyed this catchShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon.CA Luster"
5,"John Wayne,Living legand.Always remember,Never forget.",Any movie made by John Wayne is unforgetable.We own them all and Are so pleased to be able to click in amazon.com and get anything we want at reasonable prices.thank you so very much for your service and to all the other companies that serve the public.I have never been dissappointed with anything I have gotten and am sure I won't be on anything I buy in the future and you can bet I will buy more.All the information is accurate and true to my findings and I've never been let down yet.To all out there feel free to buy.Amazon is the best.As you can tell I am a western buff and real country girl.Amazon Provides all the movies I am looking for plus more that I have ordered and enjoyed very much.Truely great company.And I thank you again.Lynn
5,Good Movie,"These 3 guys just robbed a bank and the sheriff is after them. They are stuck in the desert without water because the sheriff has men all over the place and they can't get out because they will get shot. They come upon a wagon were a lady is about to have a baby and she is all alone because her husband went to search for water and food and never came back. The lady is the sheriffs daughter and they were moving out west to liver with her parents. The three robbers help deliver the baby and the mother dies They know nothing about babies at all. But the mother has a chest with a book on how to raise babies. They put axle grease on the baby. The sheriff is closing in on them so they continue on there way. 2 of the 3 men die, only John Wayne lives. Then he gets to the town & gets arrested."
5,the three god fathers is a classic film you have to see it. One of John Wayne's best film,"this is a great classic film by John Wayne that I seen as a child, highly reccomend to friends and family"
3,Far short of a masterpiece,"Well, on the good side I would list the fabulous Technicolor cinematography and the strong cast (especially the wiley sheriff). There are also any number of excellent individual sequences, and many of Ford's hallmark movement shots -- horses across the desert, etc.On the minus side I need to list inconsistent manner and tone, excessive length, frequently poor timing and pacing, and a mawkish sentimentality and religiosity that I, personally, find very unpleasant. Give me ""Fort Apache"" any day! But the film is still of interest for John Ford mavens."
5,"Excellent for lunatics,lovers and poets!","If you love this play and are thrillled by the stage history and staging minutiae, the this book will send you reeling! The historical reasearch is encyclopediac and captivating. Your rude sea will grow civil with its song."
