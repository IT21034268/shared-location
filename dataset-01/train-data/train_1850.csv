4,Great family show,"The cover makes the video look scary - it's not! It's about a father and son taking a trip in the forest (somewhere in Washington state, I believe) and discovering nature - and each other. The nature photography is incredible and a wonderful learning experience. Threaded through the story is a subplot about ""martians""...and the legends of the forest, again not scary but intriguing."
2,ice pack doesn't last long,I am disappointed with this item. I love fit & fresh and have may of their other products. This one doesn't stay cold long enough and my fruit and hummus were lukewarm by lunch. All of my other products keep my lunch nicely chilled but this ice ring doesn't seem to be large enough to last. The container itself is great and will be useful so the purchase was not a complete waste.
4,Item smaller than thought it would be. Not happy with Amazon pricing.,"I had this in my wish list when it was listed at $6.99. When I was ready to buy it a few days later, Amazon said the price had gone up to $9.99. I really needed it so I bought it. Of course when I check now, the price is back down to $6.99. What's with the pricing Amazon? It would be nice if I could get my 3 bucks back! Anyway, on to the product. It was smaller than I expected it, but like another reviewer said, it's amazing how much you can fit into it. I use it mostly for cut up fruit and my family snacks from it throughout the day. Thinking about buying another but if I put it in my cart, Amazon will probably jack up the price again."
2,just an afternoon snack size,"I was looking for something for both myself and my husband that we could keep chilled in the fridge for a quick snack. It takes a lot of time to cut up all those fruits and veggies and I thought this could provide a good storage place. If you're looking for something for just an afternoon snack this could be for you. If you want something for more than a meal or two you won't like this. The compartments are very small and you'd have to cut your fruit/veggies up so small to fit into the compartments. I don't need anything making more work for me. To give you an idea, you'd have to cut a stick of celery at least in 4ths maybe 5ths to get it to fit. Good for a kids lunch or a toddler or younger child."
4,Good for lunches or storing food in the fridge,"Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken."
5,The Best Way to Get Kids to Love Veggies,"As a mother, grandmother, and author of a book about helping kids learn to love veggies and other healthy foods, I recommend this product. It is the right size for an assortment of cut up veggies like carrots, broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower. The dip goes in the middle. This is a great way to fill kids up on veggies after school, on a trip in the car, on a picnic, after soccer or other activities, or before supper. It can also be used for fruit with yogurt for dipping. Each child can have one and personalize it. The frozen ring that snaps in the top (takes a little practice to get it out -- then it's easy) is useful for snacking away from home. And I love mine for hiking - it is small enough for a day pack. Enjoy!! Eleanor Taylor, RN co-author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family (Fork and Spoon Field Guides)"
3,Nice but don't count on the ice ring,"I bought two of these and one of them arrived with the ice ring cracked in the center. The company sent me out a new one right away and I was careful with the ice rings since the first one broke during shipping. Only used them about 10 times and the second ice ring broke. The container is great and fits perfectly in the kid's lunchboxes. The inner container is convenient and doesn't leak if you put liquids in it, but don't count on the ice rings. Company doesn't sell ice rings separately so it is back to the ice pack in the lunch bag again."
4,Love it! Mostly!,"I bought this bowl and used it 3 or 4 times. You know the best part? The center bowl doesn't leak!!! I've had so much trouble taking milk to work for cereal in water bottles because they either leak or I can't get the sour milk smell out of the plastic or they're just way too big for the amount of milk needed.I love this bowl! I read other reviews complaining about the size of the bowl! Um hello! Part of it's function is portion control!The only thing I dislike is the snap on spoon. I feel like a 3 year old with a training spoon. It's huge (the actual part you eat from) and the handle is ridiculously cumbersome. Otherwise, this item performs exactly as advertised.You'll love it!"
4,MARTIAL ARTS ACTION MOVIE,"""TRUE LEGEND WAS INDEED A VERY GOOD ACTION-PACKED MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE. IT KIND OF REMINDED ME ABOUT SOME OLD SCHOOL MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES WE USED TO SEE.""THANK YOU!!!! HERB SIMON. KATY, TX."
5,Very good movie,"Had to watch this movie through Netflix since my device does not support the software used to watch videos on here. Anyway the movie was fantastic. Great graphics, greater story line(tearjerker though), awesome martial arts. Highly recommend to any martial arts film lover."
3,should've been a trilogy,"i don't have any backstory to this film.....but it clearly should've been a trilogy. the first two parts were very well done....and at the end of what SHOULDVE BEEN the film's climax....it keeps going. i don't understand why. the part after the climax should've been an entirely different film.it was good....don't get me wrong....but after the main struggle driving the main part of the story is concluded...it should have ENDED....but for some reason the filmmakers decided to keep it going. i am having a tough time grasping why they went in that direction. maybe the director saw Ip Man 2 and felt inspired? the ""final"" final scene in this film defnitely doesn't compare to the final scene in Ip Man 2.so maybe just watch the first 2/3 of this film....then go rent Ip Man 2. :]"
3,good movie,so much action. tends to be too violent filled with vengeance which is truly a bad culture for any society.
4,Great action and good movie.,"I got this movie on a whim. I saw it advertised on AOTS and I got it pretty cheap for a BlueRay. I do wish that it had come as a DVD/BlueRay combo but none the less it was worth the purchase. Overall the movie was good. The story was a little disjointed which made for a downgraded review but the acting was good for this kind of flick, the action was amazing (which if it wasn't for the action the movie would not be good), and visuals (which enhanced the action and overall feel of the movie) made this a must see for those enthusiasts of martial arts and foreign films."
2,Depressing!,"I'm a big martial arts and HK cinema fan, but man was this depressing!! Visually, it looked good and action was good, and the initial bad guy was ok.SPOILER ALERT!!! ENTIRE PLOT SUMMARIZED HERE - please skip if you don't want to spoil the story! Continue on if you want to know specifically why I felt this film was depressing...Bascially this is the fictional story of Su Can, aka ""Beggar Su,"" who invented drunken boxing. Of course this was preceded by his brother-in-law killing his father and later his wife, the loss of his life as a teacher, his descent into madness (as in ""A Beautiful Mind""), and finally his becoming a drunk and homeless father. What a downer!!!"
4,Good buy axis/risk,Quick shipping and good buy if you like old board games and have nobody to play with for hours.
4,after market,This is not quite the same as the origional. The origional had a collar on it that kept it from dropping down in the router. Unfortunatly ryobi dosen't offer a exact replacement even on their website. It does work well.
2,Please enter,can choose whether this is displayed on the site or not; we'll keep it private it if you choose to not have it displayed alongside your review.
5,Good for 18 month old,"My 18 month old had no trouble figuring out how to use these. I just put a few drops of clean water on each pad, showed him how to use it and he went nuts. He loved using h paint brush and didn't have any trouble using the paints."
2,intermittently interesting,"This collection of ""transmissions from the edge of style culture"" is intermittently interesting, depending on one's personal interests, level of interest in cultural studies and tolerance for semi-academic jargon. Beard's pieces are mostly republished from various style mags (mostly i-D and Arena) he wrote for over the course of the '90s. For me, he's probably at his best extolling various sci-fi writers like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, or J. G. Ballard or specific topics as opposed to the pieces where he's making broader assertions or bringing together bits and pieces of his vast reading. Likely to appeal to a fairly limited audience."
5,Underground Black Metal,"For any of you out there who are into TRUE underground black metal, Vinland Rising is a necessary addition to your collection. Long Reign the Horde of Darkenwood!!!!"
5,Emails,"E-mail from God by Curt and Claire Cloninger is the one book I look to when I need help in this world. This book is written in a form of an email from God to a teenager who might hav some problems in his/her life. The emails talk about many different things, including peer pressure, popularity, sports, and family life. This helps you to be able to handle all the rude comments and cruel things people will say or do to you through your life. God talks to about about how you are perfect the way you are and you don't need to change because of what other people say about you.I really enjoyed reading this book. It helps a lot with maning different aspects in my life and helps me be able to hande all the tough situations. It has helped me be able to ignore all of the rude comments that come my way and be able to stand up for myself and others. I would recommend this book to anybody who is having any sort of trouble in their life."
1,e-mail NOT from God,"The problem with these types of books is that they are not authentically inspired by God. This book contains a lot of sentimentalism packaged in a contemporary commercial form. The authors have a lot of good stuff to say, but when they present it as a message from God they are not telling the truth. This is a dangerous thing to present to teens especially, as it teaches them to think of God as an imaginary friend that helps them cope with life. They know the e-mails in the book aren't really from God, but the book presents the pretense anyway. This lays the foundation for an inauthentic and shallow faith that gravitates toward false spirituality. If that's what you're looking for, enjoy the book. Shame on the authors for using God's name on the by-line to peddle e-mails they themselves have written."
4,I am so Pleased this has been Reissued,"For years I have heard of this book, but it was unavailable. It is a worthy addition to your library.This work is notable from three points of view. First, as others have noted it is a military story about partisan warfare, spirit and dedication. Dodd is a model soldier, a wonderful example.Next, it is a painless primer on the Peninsular War. What was it like? Not too nice. (Sharps's Gold also deals with this war.)Finally, it is a standalone book by Forester, the writer of the Hornblower series. Those of us who love Hornblower learn more about the author and the art of writing by seeing such a different work.A good book for the military professional. An excellent thriller for teenaged boys. An interesting sidelight for the Hornblower fan."
3,"A Good Read, but...","I enjoyed the book, but I did find Dodd to be just a little to robot like. You have to figure that he would get harden to death and suffering, but I think that Forester takes it just a little to far. On the up side the action sequences are really well done."
4,Good reading,"I am a C.S. Forester fan so I figured why not, so I got this book. I enjoyed it very much. He does a great job in getting Dodd home. He also does a great job in showing how rough things were for both sides and that the French were not invincible."
3,One British Soldier behind French Lines,Rifleman Dodd is inadvertently left behind by his regiment while fighting in Portugal. He hooks up with local partisans and raises as much trouble as he can behind the French lines while all the time trying to get back to his regiment. Good account of fighting in the Napoleanic Wars from the perspective of a common British soldier just trying to do his duty to God and Country.
3,"OK, Not Up To Hornblower Standards","Good depiction of army life of the era. Didn't feel the characters were developed nearly as well as in the Hornblower series. Rifleman Dodd, in particular, was rather one dimensional. I ended the book having more empathy for the French soldiers of Napoleon than for the Dodd."
4,masterful descriptions,"I found this satisfying, and believable. This was a nice addition to the author's impressive list of his wonderfully realized tales."
1,"Out of date, useless book","This book is so out of date, it commonly refers to the advent of the minicomputer and its potential effects on the business world. Its filled with ot of date theories, and it takes a down right insulting view of computer professionals. It goes as far as saying that data entry personel are unreliable and should not be trusted!"
1,"Not colored pencils, just ordinary lead","I thought these were ""colored pencils"" as the title states, but it just means that the outside plastic is colored and the lead is regular lead."
3,Plastic Is Not Durable,"As a mechanical pencil the papermate does a decent job and i cannot complain more. It is a plain and simple design, gets the job done. The Mechanical pencil also has a nice grip included. The lead is very smooth to write with and flows very well on the paper. However there is a major flaw, the outer shell of the pencil made of very brittle plastic and is easy to crack. Many of my pencils have cracked after being placed between a textbook or in my backpack. After a while the fracture on the pencil will extend making the pencil useless and i have to toss one out."
5,e-Video and the Internet Revolution,"This new book presents a big picture analysis and roadmap of how internet video and the developing convergence of standards is leading to new applications of technology, thus adding additional fuel to the internet revolution. It provides not only a conceptual framework to enable a comprehensive understanding the convergence of technologies, but also a detailed guide through the complexities of new applications which is critical during this pre-shakedown phase of e-video.The insights from this book are invaluable in conducting practical technology evaluations of new technologies. The book provides how-to examples that are entry points into the topics discussed in the book. The book also provides additional references to provide the reader easy access to additional information on the broad diversity of topics covered. This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in understanding the ongoing internet revolution and the expanding role of e-video."
5,A unique masterpiece sent from outer space,"This album is unlike anything else I've heard. The combination of electronic sounds, guitar & percussion is out of this world. One of the musicians plays a chapman stick. I'm not sure what that is, but I'm guessing it is responsible for some of the interested sounds on this album. Torn is very experimental and incorporates spacey licks, feedback, and leverages his whammy bar to create a soundscape that sounds something like futuristic indian sitarists on a mission to Mercury. Despite the experimentation and wide array of sounds, there is good song writing here as well. While I love to listen to experimental music, its hard to listen to it too long if the music is just a random improvisation with no song structure. That is not the case here. I highly recommend this album."
4,Excellent release.,"This is an excellent release. Not quite as good as ""Tripping Over God"" or ""Polytown"" in my humble opinion, but still excellent nevertheless. David Torn is a master composer and uses his guitar and assorted instruments to make beautiful exotic soundscapes. Highly recommended."
1,a letdown,"After hearing other work by Torn in Everyman Band and with Jan Garbarek I was expecting something on the level of King Crimson ""Red."" I found jazz and fusion largely through listening to prog rock, especially KC, so this album was personally exciting for me.The tracks never seemed to get off the ground and get coherence. I found Isham to be a breathy distraction.Levin and Buford never got their quirky groove on, and after a few listens I stopped trying so hard to like it and moved on to something else. Oh well."
2,Completely missed the mark,"Unlike the other reviewers, I found this CD a major letdown. I have been interested in The looper guitar thing for awhile. This music seems very re-hashed stuff. Some of the drum and bass lines are good, but Torn should lose the whammy bar! I'm sure he's a better guitarist than this. Sounds to me like poor Eddie Van Halen copies!"
2,Don't scrimp on your kid's safety!,"You get what you pay $[...] for...a helmet not even worthy enough for a kid to use. The soft, outer plastic has the same exact hardness as a 2-liter soda bottle. What kind of protection is that? The thick, bulky, styrofoam padding inside does not compensate for the outer shells' lack of scuff and impact absorption. Also, the 21 tiny vents do not cool very well either. If you value your kid's life...spend a few bucks more and get a helmet with at least 24 vents and IN-MOLD(hardshell) construction, please!I gave it two stars because the straps and fit was really the BEST thing about this flimsy helmet."
2,Disappointing,"Like many parents we watched the movie and loved it. (It was on our son's Xmas wish list.) Sadly, the book is not nearly as satisfying. While the writing is capable the story is weak, the characters poorly drawn (pun intended) and the language, while not overly strong, comes across as inappropriate for the age group. I almost never say this, but the movie was fantastic, the book...not so much (to quote a joke from the film)."
4,Recommended,I recommend this book to you if you like a thrilling humorous book! It's about a boy named Hiccup and a dragon named Toothless. The boy named Hiccup is on a mission to train a dragon that he found in a cave. And you'll want to know that the training is a very bumpy ride. The pictures in this book are poorly drawn on purpose. To find out the end to this read it! And remember keep reading!
5,Funny adventures of heroes-in-training,"In this first volume of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III's memoirs, How To Train Your Dragon will impart funny adventures of heroes-in-training, tell of giant sneezes and ocean deeps, and will attract many a reluctant reader who will instantly be drawn by the zany adventures, humor, and black and white whimsical drawings peppered within."
3,What I like and don't like about How to Train Your Dragon,"I like the book because it has dragons in it and a kid who can tame dragons by speaking Dragonese. What I don't like about it is the jerky kids in it - that act like they're all superior and high and mighty over Hiccup. I think the ""How to Tame your Dragon"" book within the book is funny even though it only has three words on the topic. ""Yell at it!"" - I'm 11 years old but my mom typed this for me."
2,"I hate to be a killjoy, but...","I read the first two books of the series and I have no desire to read any further. The writing is good but that's about it. The stories are only okay, the characters are totally forgettable and the dragons are just cowardly little flying rodents. This is one of those instances where the movie is way better. In the movie the characters and dragons have a nobility that comes through in the end, but it's almost completely absent in the book. I also thought the meanness of some of the characters in the book might send the wrong message to its target audience. If you're a parent looking for a quality read for your kids, I'd look somewhere else."
3,Meh.,"We've enjoyed the movie and the new weekly TV show a lot, so I was excited to dig into these books with my 8 & 5 y/o boys. As stated earlier, they're not along the same storyline as the movies. Written better than many books for this age group--decent vocabulary, fun kid-like drawings throughout. The disappointing differences I found from the movie were a) the never-ending need to resort to bodily functions and wimpy character traits for humor (do NO authors think children can laugh at clever, inspiring things these days??), and in at least this first volume, wimpy heroes and unlikeable, selfish dragons. This is a far cry from the rise-above-your-obstacles, likeable characters in the movie. I suspect that if I read the full set, Hiccup & Tootless' characters would DEVELOP into what's portrayed in the movie... I bought Vol. 2 to this series because I figured we'd excitedly read the whole set, but we'll be lucky to even finish Vol. 1, and I will scan Vol. 2 before I start it."
1,Inappropriate language in these books,"Unfortunately I had purchased the entire book set for my son, who is young. He mostly read the books to himself. He asked me to read a chapter to him from book 6 and I was appalled to read about a character named ""Big Boobied Bertha"" and the word ""breasts"" were actually used. My chin hit the floor upon reading this. I don't know if this character is in book one, but she is in book 6. I just wanted to warn future buyers of this book series what their innocent little children will be reading. I understand that there is some other language used that I definitely don't want my children repeating, and if they read it in a book, they will repeat it.I don't recommend this series."
1,Not entertaining at all,"I didn't like this book. I read it because I liked How to Train Your Dragon the movie and I thought, ""Oh I'd like to check out the book"". Thankfully I got it from the library rather than purchased it. Honestly this is the first time I've ever said the movie was better than the book because the book is just awful. There's no real depth, you don't care either way about the characters and even the dragons are boring. The illustrations are sub par but I don't really need those but I do need a good entertaining story. If this had been told by a 5 yr old I would have said ""well done!"" but for a real writer to have come up with this drivel is just agonizing. I kept hoping it would get better. Now some say because I'm an adult I can't understand it but really if someone had given this book to me when I was a kid I would have felt the same way. I still read kids books for entertainment and this had nothing to offer."
5,Get my kid addicted to reading chapter book!,My kid loves dragons so when it's time for her to read chapter books I got her this collection.She loves the variety of dragons that are introduced in each book and the antics of the protagonists.Now she's at book #7 and she read it in two days!What else could a parent asked for?(PS: The story in the book is quite different from the movie adaptation but they are both equally good. My kid doesn't have any problem with either one; they are like parallel universes to her)
3,"Too much ""shut up"" and ""stupid""","At least once a day, I am reminding one of my boys ""we say hush"" or ""ideas can be stupid, but people never are"".So then what happens?I pick up this ""How to Train Your Dragon"" book for family reading time, and SHUT UP and STUPID are major parts of the dialog. Along with SNOT and even a little CRAP.Forget how to train my dragon -- How am I supposed to train my little boys when the most massively entertaining book we have read in a year is chock-full of the very words they are forbidden to say? Everyone can read -- they know when I'm skipping words.Anyway, excellent plot, great humor, I love the story. My kids are wild over the map.Too bad about the language."
4,enamored with the old-style paper edges,"I had seen this book in the store, and loved the rough edges on the pages, as if it were printed/bound back in the day. When I went back to purchase at the bookstore, this book was out of stock. I came to Amazon's website but could not find information confirming that this printing had the same uneven pages. Ordered anyway, and yes, the pages were the quaint style I had hoped for."
5,A fun book to read together or for your young reader to read to themselves.,I read this book to my son before he was reading. We both enjoyed the humor and adventure of the story. Now that he is reading on his own he has reread this and enjoyed it just as much the second time.
5,Great series for 2nd-5th grade,"A friend of mine bought this for her 10-year-old and he loved the books so much that he asked me to read them...and they're great!This series is really nothing like the movie, but the movie is aimed at an older crowd, and the books are so much more creative.I ended up buying this set for my book loving 8-year-old nephew who read them straight through in a week! Now I'm back to buy the set again for my 6-year-old so we can read it together!"
4,Very funny and highly recommended!,"I must admit even though I'm an adult, I still enjoys reading children books. Hiccup series is one of my favorite children books; I like it so much, if I have kids I'll shove it to their throats. Hiccup was an unusual Hero in every way. Born as Viking, he was skinny, short, plain, and prefers to use his head to think, and not to bump it to his enemies as most of Vikings in his era would do. I had good laughs every time I read this book and I never get bored. Every time I feel the need to escape from 'difficult' books and want a little laugh, Hiccup Series never fails me."
5,my favorite book ever,i loved this book so much. The story is great. There's tons of pictures. There's tons of dragons. And this book is perfect for young readers. You should really read this fantastic action packed story.
5,"Good, insightful documentary","Good, insightful docu, enjoyed it a lot! Seems to be based in great parts on the Natascha Rambova bio ""Madam Valentino"". Clarifies why their marriage didn't work out."
1,Script Kiddie Scratch Book,I would certainly say that this is a case of a Script Kiddie trying to get smart and act as a White hat.It is more of Ctrl C & Ctrl V with lots of editing to hide traces of where the original work has come out of.Looks like the publishers done a favour by publishing this one.
2,Script Kiddies are Weenies !,"OH well, nice book for beginners but I would never recommend it to anyone except other 16 year olds."
1,Appalling,"This book is appalling. I have the Indian version and it is sloopily put together as well as dated. In addition, it is hardly ethical in any sense of the word when the author suggests that you use your ISP to hack.In addition, I have found script references in the book that are not written by the author and yet he doesn't identify this fact. He leaves them as if he wrote them. Further some chapters are nothing more than just a cut and paste from existing websites that are not the author's work.If I was the publisher, I would be looking more deeply into this author's credibility. If you are serious about security, get a book like ... If you just want to be a script kiddie, this will do you fine."
1,Already returned the book,"This book is awful. There are typos everywhere and some of the paths in the registry that he refers to are incorrect. After reading the book for only one day, I have returned it. Most of the information is available on the Internet with little searching. Also, as Microsoft is no longer supporting Windows 95, the author should look for a more current operating system. This book it is sloopily put together as well as dated."
1,This book is a joke,"I am more than upset with the author of this book. All the material can be found easily by searching the Internet and by doing a search at www.microsoft.com. The zip files that are mentioned in the book are corrupted. Not only that but when I reported the problem to the author, I got nothing from him -- that was almost a year ago, I am not sure about the files as of Oct 1, 2008.I don't recommend this book -- well, I do. If you have a fireplace and you are out of wood. Other than that, save your money and search for other more serious books online."
5,Excellent!!! Best Book ever written on Computer Security!!!,"I have read the Indian edition of the ethical hacking book and found it stunningly comprehensive ey easy to understand. It is the best guide for a beginner who wants to learn about hacking techniques. Ankit's writing style is great and the author has really not left any subject untouched. It is a must read and should be a part of every computer enthusiast's bookshelf.I work for a Computer Consultancy firm and found this book very helpful in my work and also a hinderance, as I kept keeping my work aside and reading this book. It is unputdownable.The author, has really done not only India, but also the entire world proud!!! Congrats Ankit!!!"
3,Not bad for a youngin'...,Those who complain about the emphasis on Win 95 should remember that Ankit's computer (as indicated on the bio page of his website) is a 166 MHZ with 32 MB RAM and a 4.3 GB hard drive. He's done more with that than I do with my 1.6 Gigahertz P4.
1,Outdated and unoriginal,Outdated and unoriginal material coupled with a poor writing style make this book a waste of time for anyone serious about studying computer security and hacking. Ankit Fadia is a joke. Do not waste your time or money!
1,Garbage,"The book has nothing but garbage. Most of the vulnerabilities hes talking about have been fixed ages back. And all this stuff is free on the net. Especially the windows registry hacking is horrible. Hes just stolen the ones that fancied him and made it into a chapter. You'll get thousands of such tricks on the net. I wonder how the publisher had the nerve to publish this stolen junk and charge so much for it.What more, this guy has now published more such books and has started a certification ""Ankit Fadia certified ethical hacker"" ! Goddamn it."
1,Did you ever heard about copyrights ?,"Whereas I'm a security auditor now, I started first as a Blackhat. This book is everything but valuable information. He cut'n'past some garbage tutorials written by [...] hackers, then he mixed them into the form of a ... well... let's say a ... book. If you want to spend time and money, if you want to learn everything but what hacking is and how a blackat think, just read this book.You'll find most of the content of this book in his website. Just make a Google search and discover yourself how he just pladgied...Hope this helps."
1,Updated edition of a plagiarizing work,"Updated edition ofThe Unofficial Guide to Ethical Hacking, which is well known for being a published work plagiarizing other works to the tune of 1/4 to 1/3 of its pages. The wise reader seeking to learn about hacking, ethics, and meshing them together will skip this book, as with all books written by unethical authors."
1,Blatant plagiarism,"I am unfortunate enough to have bought a copy of this book in 2002 or 2003, which together with Google and the Internet Archive made verifying claims of plagiarism leveled by others on the Internet very straightforward in 2012.Nearly one third of this book's pages has plagiarized content. The author stripped attribution from copied content, including notices of copyright on the source content having such. The author was even bold enough to claim personal authorship of a few of the plagiarized programs included in this book.A Web search using the author's name and the word 'plagiarism' as the search terms yields enlightening results about this book. If you don't believe that this book is literally a waste of your money, then perform that search."
1,Garbage,"If you are a beginner and know how to use a search engine such as google, then you will get all the information in this book for free from the Net (I bet thats what the author did as well). I have been working in Security for over 9 years and I don't understand what is so special about this book - more like garbage to me. Check out Ryan Russell's - Hack Proofing Your Network - 2nd Editon and Mike Shiffeman's new - Building Open Source Network Security tools. These are worth spending $$."
1,Pure junk..,Funny how people can get away with this kind of garbage. The 5* reviews must have been written by the author himself. Waste of money.
1,Official guide to Unethical copy and paste (plagarism),"How can anybody turn up pure garbage like this in the form of a book, and claim to be any sort of security expert. Just as the book, this guy is a sham. The only positive reviews on this site would be those doctored by the author himself."
2,Buy another book please!,"Most of the information in this book is well documented on the Internet. Save your money! If you can't resist buying this book, please buy a used one. This book is definitely for beginners advanced users can pass this one up."
5,Easy Read; Informative,"As an IT professional, I was looking for comprehensive reading to strengthen my network security knowledge. This book fulfilled that goal well. I am very pleased at the value obtained. I would surely recommend this material to those interested. It appears easy enough of a read for a beginner, but even as a seasoned vet I found it very useful."
5,A Solid Guidebook,"If you want to know about the art, architecture, history, culture, and landscapes of Northern Italy, then this is the book you need. Using solely this guide, we spent 2 weeks in and around this region of Italy. We never wondered what we were looking at, because we merely turned to the location in the guide, and read all about the place.To me, as a well-traveled person, if I want to know something about a place, a Blue Guides will give me all you ever wanted to know. A Blue Guide is my ""tour guide"" wherever I go. The thoughtful insights and small drawings add a nice feel to the book, and the information is always right on the money."
3,pink pig puppets,"fun for the two year old whom I gave them to. Initially she played w/ them, but did not sustain interest (when I used one and she used one)"
3,It is cute,"It is cute, but note as cute as the picture shows. However, the size is like what showed in the picture."
4,Piggly-Wiggly,"CUTE!!!!That is all I can say for this sweet little ""oinker"". I collect pigs, and had to get it for my growing collection.Nice for young and old. Great service!"
2,A Bizarre and Weird Black Comedy,This dark comedy has to be the most bizarre cult classic ever and the weird part was it was set in the 1950s and it was a black comedy about a kid who discovers his parents are cannibals and he notices because all they eat for dinner is meat and that night's leftovers and plus he has nightmares about them.There isn't too much violence or gore or special effects instead actor turned director Bob Balaban focuses on suspense and make the viewer figure out the scenes plus the music(The man that did the Twin Peaks music composed this)makes the scenes eerie.This bizarre movie has weird scenes like the boy goes into the kitchen and sees an arm in the sink and blood spilling from the top of the fridge and another scene were the boy sees a leg on a meathook in the basement.Rent or watch this one on TV(Showtime and TNT show it) but do not buy till you see it.
4,I'll never eat sausage again!,"What an interesting, scary, beautiful movie. Its plot of maniacal parents shocks and terrifies us, but its themes of loneliness and lost innocence are what makes the film a must-see. The camerawork is hypnotic, the soundtrack is first rate and the performances still make me shiver. Go see this film!"
3,I'm now a vegetarian (just kidding),"I happened upon this movie, as did some others, late at night. I too was morbidly fascinated. I particularly identified with the helplessness of the little boy. The movie was not needlessly gory, as horror movies go. Rather, the psychological tension was more horrifying. The depictions of the preparation and serving of meat were enough to cause one to think about the barbarism of eating all animals! The set dresser deserves high praise for the authenticity of the 50's decor and customs. I am not a particular fan of horror movies, but this one was ""deliciously"" engaging."
1,So Boring!,This movie was just too boring for me to enjoy. I decided to give it a look since it was on Fearnet on Xfinity On Demand but I just couldn't take it. It drags on and on and its attempt to be humorous amid the horror just comes off as silly. Everything moves just way too slow and nothing really happens.Maybe it's unfair for me to review the movie without finishing it but I saw about an hour of it and dozed off several times. I gave up from that point on.I can't say whether you should try it or not. People are different and others might like it but it was like watching paint dry to me. I was a kid in '89 when this came out and I never heard of the movie until now. I see why it obviously wasn't a hit.
3,Duuuuuude...,"This movie was really, really weird. I turned on the TV at 2 AM, and the first thing I saw was a kid drowning in a pool of blood. Needless to say, I had no choice but to watch the rest of the movie. The movie seemed to serve no real purpose, which is why I liked it. It was incredibly surreal. (Then again, part of that might have been because I was half-asleep.) In the morning, I actually convicned myself it had been a dream.Anyway, through this whole thing I was expecting it to be deep, but it had a Goosebumps-type ending, which sort of ruined it for me. Well, anyway, I'm done now. I should never write reviews."
4,La Marque Loop-It watches,These are great watches.I use them all the time.great for business meetings as you can look down thoughtfullyto get the time instead of looking at your wrist.Only reason I don't give it five stars is that the batteriesneed to be replaced reasonably often.
1,Pain in the neck,"I think I received a defective pillow. Simmons forgot to make it comfortable!The pillow is very firm/hard and the foam feels cheap. My wife has a memory foam pillow, that I love, that is the same size but weighs twice as much. Not sure if the heavier weight means better quality or not. I wish I knew what brand hers is and I would buy it in a second.I only tried this pillow out for a few days so it may need a ""break in"" period to become comfortable but my neck couldn't stand the pain. If you like firm pillows or sleep on your side, this pillow might work for you.One the plus side, my son said it was a perfect pillow to have in a pillow fight."
4,Great music!,"Upbeat songs, lyrics easy to understand and easy to sing to.My classroom loved the songs."
4,Good,Excellent and very moderately priced product although does not work with newer model ipods. I had to purchase an older generation ipod video to get it to function properly.
4,pretty neat!,"a bit quirky but the sound is surprisingly good. It would be nice if the Ipod menu showed up on the screen and if the controls managed all of teh Ipod functions, but I like it! Good to use in the care as the controls are big and where I live it works much better than an FM transmitter. For lss than $100 this is a real bargain! (if you have the Ipod)"
2,Bad headphone audio output,"I had the same experience that an earlier reviewer had: the headphone output puts out a static that is very noticeable and distracting with high-quality headphones. (I use the Shure E3c.) You can still hear the static, but more faintly, if you use the stock Apple earbuds.I've had this problem on two units so far, and even SI's tech support was baffled. I am returning it, since the noise is very distracting during dialogue scenes. The speaker output is fine."
2,Not as good as expected,These speakers are not as good as I expected out of Sonic Impact. I have the Sonic Impact i-F2 speakers at home and they perform MUCH better than these do.The sound is inferior and tinny.
2,Be careful,"I just purchased one of these at a greatly reduced price of 50 bucks, and noticed from the start that the screen sucked - no brightness awful color values, bad sharpness, I must have adjusted the settings for over an hour, comparing between full screen/wide screen. When I returned the device they told me all had been returned for the very same reason and taken off the shelf.Sadly I did like everything else about this product, design, structure, materials, layout...it just didn't workO and the touch buttons were awful, you had to use the remote for everything."
2,sonic 55,"The speakers sound great, but the Ipod connector is difficult to use - seems like it will break easily. Once the I-pod is down in position to use the video screen, it is difficult to get it back out. The Video screen did not work. Sending unit back for refund."
4,I wooted it.,"I got this item from a Wootoff and at a nice little price of $35.It has good picture quality (not the best in the world), great sound (actually... scratch that, amazing sound), and fits my Ipod video perfectly.The buttons do not stick, and in fact mine are touch sensitive, so I have to be careful when moving the device. I bought a car charger adapater for it, so riders in my car can just sit still in the backseat and watch TV for the long trips.Really there isn't much to say. It is basically a portable IPOD play with a larger screen that can play your music (loudly) or your movies.I like it, and I REALLY like it on the airplan."
4,good with the iPod,"Bought this to take on a road trip. Worked very good. It is kind of quirky when you try to turn it off, but once you figure the correct sequence to follow it has since not been a problem. Look forward to many years of use."
4,Works Great with 60GB 5th Gen,"We acquired a 60GB Ipod Classic 5th Gen from my mother and this Sonic Impact and it is perfect for our little girl during travel. It is extremely durable. The speakers are legit and the screen, although not super high res, is very effective for why we are using it. If you are trying to repurpose an old 60GB Ipod 5th gen, this is the accessory for you!"
1,Beware...,"I bought one of these yesterday. It is the new version that has a 4:3 selection. That works just fine. BUT the bigger issue is that this box will not play ANY 16:9 standard Apple formatted file properly. You cannot download an iTunes wide screen video (wide screen TV, for example) and fill the screen. The unit really wants a 4:3 anamorphic file which is not an Apple standard. So whether you hack a movie with Handbrake or download one from iTUnes, if it is widescreen it will not play properly. Every widescreen movie will be smashed with black bars above and below.This is to be expected for movies with a 2.35 aspect ratio. But for movies with a 1.85 aspect ratio, they should fill this screen. They will not. I am returning my unit since Sonic is apparently not going to warrant this engineering flaw under their 1 year warranty."
1,BEWARE if you have iPod Classic (160gb),"The V55 seems to be a slick device. I just got mine. I like it, with one major exception: I have an iPod Classic 160gb. Guess what! Apple blocks ""TV Out"" unless you have an ""auth chip"" from Apple and the V55 does not. I knew I risked that problem when I ordered it, I was just hoping it would work. The curse of Apple has been biting me for a while now with my iPod.Still, v55 looks very nice (shows fingerprints badly) and sounds really good playing music. Wish I could play videos on it. Not Sonic Impact's fault though."
5,WOW!!!,"all i can say is this is the best,,,bought the black ipod video the same day i bought this,,,,everyone sayas it's the sickest ipod system!!! even better than touch lol...."
3,Needs more than one earphone jack and volume that goes higher!,Decent unit - works great with my 60GB ipod. I bought this so my kids could watch ipod movies on the plane. Problem is that there is only one headphone jack and the volume doesn't go loud enough.
4,Awsome Sound Quality,"While the screen is super nice too, what I was amazed by is the sound quality of the small speakers! You can turn it all the way up with no distortion, close the top and use it as an ipod boom box. Really nice."
1,Not Very Informative -- Much Better Books Out There,"I bought this book after reading many of the great editorial reviews, quotes, and customer reviews. It sounded like a complete guide that would step up my public relations tactics. However, after reading the book I realize it was just good PR. If you've been in the PR business for even a short while, this text won't teach you much. It covers the basics, which is nice if you don't know them, but it's more suitable for an introductory course on public relations than anything else.If you really want to learn a lot about public relations, I would recommend Complete Publicity Plans by Sandra Beckwith. It's nearly 1/3 the cost of this book, yet worth much more."
2,The Missing Element,"An excellent and important story that needs to be told over and over again. But for those of us who use non-fiction books such as this for research as well, this book lacks a crucial element--an index. I could not recommend this book to someone researching information on the Holocaust because there is no way for someone to retrieve important information without laboriously searching page by page through the book. When will publishers learn what researchers and librarians know, a non-fiction book without an index is not complete?"
3,Mary,"I got this book yesterday! I am no longer in high school, but I can relate to must quizzes like if your in collage. I got it to have some fun, it cost me only $1.00 with shipping it was like $2 more. I like it so far it's ok! Better for teens but still fun. The conditions were good! Not new, it did have little marks on the cover do to bending the page. But it was still good. For a $1.00 its o,k!"
1,Not What I expected...,"...or ""You can't judge a book by its cover!""When I ordered this book, I thought it would be a selection of questions for academic competitions -- a quiz bowl book for high school. Wrong. Seriously wrong. It's a touchy-feely book for girls who will grow up and take the multiple choice self-tests in women's magazines that ask ""Am I Good at Getting Him to Notice Me?"" or ""Am I a Fashion Addict?""It's time to take the pledge: I will NEVER order a book online again unless there is a description of the book."
3,Dry and Sappy,"If you think that this book will help you find your true self, you're wrong. It's filled with quizzes that aren't original and will leave you wondering why you bought this book in the first place."
5,My favorite Oregon ecm recording,"Other , better writers , have pretty much said it all as pertains to this exceptional record from the AWESOME chamber jazz/world music group Oregon . Just wanted to pile on and encourage you to get this particular date . If you like these guys and love Ralph's BLUE SUN solo recording , you should find a way to get here ."
3,"Christopher Isherwood, boys and all","Christopher Isherwood goes to Berlin in 1931. Not for the culture or the history, he says, but for the boys. He meets plenty of boys, watches the rise of the Nazis, encounters a number of people he will later write about (to their dismay) and eventually returns to Britain. The movie is interesting enough but never too involving. Isherwood was an observer all his life, and that distance-keeping reserve shows in the movie. Still, he knew his own skin and was happy in it. He was a fine writer. And to my way of thinking, a more inviting person than his pal, the gloomy Auden. Matt Smith, who plays Isherwood, does a good job but you must ignore his perfect resemblance to Dr. Who."
2,Odd and did not like.,"The movie is set during WWII, which is my favorite era. The movie is slow, you always are thinking things are going to get better but Christopher is worthless. Not a very good movie. I have over a thousand movies and this is one of the few I wish I did not buy."
5,Christopher and his kind,"I thought it was an excellent portrayal of Christopher Isherwood and the times. All of the actors were brilliant especially Matt Smith. The scenery was also very good, I had no idea it was shot in Ireland, until the credits. All round excellent in every way."
4,"Steamy, Sad, and Nostalgic","I've seen a lot of movies and series about World War Two, or Germany, once it's been occupied by Hitler. This was an interesting look at Berlin, before and during Hitler's initial rise to power. It had a very personal feeling to it, through the eyes of one person, who had a detached attitude to things around him, but couldn't help getting emotionally involved. There was a good balance of humor and romance with the tragedy of the Nazis rise to power and the intolerance that rose with it, as well as a beautiful depiction of the homoerotic wonderland Christopher found and lost."
3,Kind of Satisfied,"The ""quality"" of the book I was receiving was marked ""Good"" with little comments as to any problems. However, when I received the book, the first couple pages immediately fell out as I opened the book. There are highlighter marks, which I didn't mind but it'd be nice to know they were there prior to purchasing the book."
1,697 pages instead of 784 and wrong photo cover,"I have to complain with the seller: I paid $ 143,81 to get the book in Italy and now I received a book of 697 pages instead 784 pages as indicated by the publisher. Moreover, the photo cover is printed upside down.How can I get explanation of that?"
4,Interior Design and Decoration Review,This book is a required textbook for my interior design classes. I believe it will be a useful resource for years to come.
1,no description?,How do you expect people to buy a $90 book without knowingwhat the book is about? Is it just pretty pictures or is itan instructional book? Please let us know
3,French story,"A ""ghost-writer"" Raphael fulfils his dream to publish a book under his own name by collecting enough data from his famous clients he had been writing biographies for while fooling around with their partners and fathering own boy.From context, it is a very poor DVD itself - no extras."
3,just finished reading the book,"I thought the book was going to be very boring but once i got started on it, it became more interesting. The book is about a navajo boy, 12 years old named Brandon who finds out that his grandfather is leaving the reservation because he is sick. Soon the two are living in the same room. My favorite part is when Brandon and his grandfather take the busride back to the reservation. If u are interested in indians, I suggest that you read this book."
3,Don't Read this if You Don't Want to.,I think this book is pretty decent. I enjoyed it but some of my classmates didn't. An appropiate audience is 5th-6th grade. I think you will enjoy this book if you are sensative and live with relatives like a grandpa or grandma. I hope you enjoy this book and I hope u like my review.
1,Not a good book,"12 year-old Brandon Rogers' grandpa has to move in with him. At first, what he does is annoying to Brandon but then he starts liking it. Brandon didn't know much about his culture until his grandpa came but then he learned how to race the sun.I didn't like this book because there wasn't any action until the end and there wasn't any suspense.I wouldnt' recommend this book because it was one of the worst books I have ever read."

5,ENCOURAGING,"THIS SEMON IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NAME SAY'S PRAISE IN THE MIDST OF PAIN WHEN YOU ARE HURTING SATAN TRIES TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH FROM PRAISING GOD BECAUSE PRAISE WILL RELEASE THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND ULTIMATELY SET YOU FREE AND BRING YOU CLOSER TO GOD, I RECOMMEND THIS MESSAGE FOR HURTING PEOPLE IN NEED OF RELEASE."
1,"Oh dear, you mean one 8oz bottle","Don't be shy about it, I do not actually want that 10 more oz. I just think that you should consider give your product another title."
1,"Warning: missing parts, no customer service","On arrival, packaging was a mess. The box was obviously opened and taped back together piece meal. The net, chains and hooks were missing. Finally, when I called the customer service number to report missing parts, it went straight to ""movie phone"" for theater listings. Looks like this company is no longer in business..."
3,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!,"This is a very nice hammock chair for ADULTS ONLY. PLEASE do not let your little ones use this chair. Children do not have enough weight to hold the chair forward and centered. My six-year old son was sitting in it twice when it fell over. The first time we thought he was swinging it. The 2nd time we saw it, and it just toppled over for no reason. He hit his head on out cement patio and sustained a significant head injury. DO NOT LET KIDS USE THIS CHAIR!!! IT IS MUCH TOO DANGEROUS!!!!!"
2,Not a hit More of a topple,Just not sturdy enough. Thought it would be the hit for Father's Day for my husband. It was not. It topples far too easily but once you are in it - it's comfy.
5,X-Chair Awesome,"This is the best chair ever. So easy to assemble and so easy to relax in. I was in this chiar 10 minutes after I put it together. And wow putting it together! No tools needed. It was so easy. I am going to be ordering another soon. Right now I have mine outside next to my pond so while reading a book I can sit,recline, or lay in comfort. Come winter I will have it in my living room. Great product and fast service. Can't wait to do more buisness with Green Eggs and Hammocks!"
1,Not Happy,"I was so excited to get this chair and stand. My husband put it together for me this morning and I tried it immediately. I have several complaints. First, even at it's highest, the chair is too low to the ground. Second, the chair is too ""clingy,"" it wraps around me, rather than supporting me. Third, IT FELL OVER with me in it. I am lucky I did not get hurt. A waste of $200."
3,green eggs and hammocks- funny!,"Like most people, I've never had much luck with hammocks. The second I'd attempt to lay in one, the thing would flip over and down to the ground I'd go (usually face-first!)I can't believe in this day and age hammocks continue to receive attention. Seems like the kind of thing that would've went out of style, but that turned out not to be the case. This hammock is basically no different from the other ones (except for the slight increase in sturdiness, which is nice). If you hate hammocks, you won't like this one either."
5,Awesome,"I have on older model that needed screws, but this is still an awesome idea. Especially in an apartment where I can't just drill holes in the ceiling.... =0"
3,"Good looking, but doesn't worth the price","Pros:My family and friends love the style of this X-Chair. It is very compact, and I can set it almost anywhere in my house. It is comfortable and functional. I end up using it more than my $1000 couch.Cons:The price is too high. It should be under $100 based on the following problems: 1) the metal stand makes a lot of noise, 2) the cotton hammock gets thinner and sinks lower each day."
5,I love my hammock!,"I received this chair for Christmas (2006) and have enjoyed it tremendously! It is very comfortable to sit or lay in. I keep it by my bookshelf to sit and read in. This chair is well made and the ropes are soft. When you sit in this chair you feel safe and at home!2010 Update - 4 years later and I still love this hammock! I keep it indoors and love to lounge around in it, reading books and watching movies."
3,not as great as I had hoped,"I bought this for my husband. We had been thinking about getting a hammock, but we don't have any trees to hang it on, so I found this. I thought it looked cooler and nicer than the hammocks you attach to poles, plus we could put it in the corner of our patio. While my husband and I both do like this hammock chair, I wish we would have just purchased a real hammock. It's hard to get into a nice relaxed position with this. If you are tight on space I would say get this one, but if you have room for a regular hammock, get that."
5,Uncomparable dramatic power,"Well, maybe comparable to Edith Piaf, perhaps, but not to any US artist that i know of. Find a Polish friend to translate the lyrics for you, they are as beautiful and mind-blowing as the singing. These songs are about 40 years old, if i am not mistaken--and they will last!"
1,Not Opera,Someone forgot to tell Mario he wasn't singing opera here.The song slection is great but most of these tunes are not suited to his style of singing.Some songs which should be sung more smoothly are instead awkwardly belted out by the tenor ruining the song and making Lanza look foolish.
1,What a piece of junk,"The Rubbermaid 'Premium' Trimline Edger is a total piece of junk. The long and short of it is that it simply doesn't work. The box says 'patent pending'.....what a waste of Rubbermaids money patenting this thing. Scratched wall, scratched trim, smeared paint........whoever designed this thing needs his brain examined and who ever approved it for marketing should be searched for a possible brain, obviously he didn't try the product before approving it.Wow.......Rubbermaid you can surely do better."
1,Metal guide scrapes the corners,"I too had the same problem. I used the Rubbermaid Premium Trimline Edger Kit only to find that the metal blade that is the edge guide scrapes my corners. As a result, the edger creates black lines on my walls. The black plastic edge also scrapes my walls around corners. I had to go over the corners again with a paint brush to cover the black lines. What a disappointment and a waste of money. The ceiling and trim edger is cheaper and more effective."
1,Where are the BLUEBERRIES?,"These are fine, if they weren't supposed to have blueberries. There are essentially none. Most pouches of the 24 don't even contain a piece of blueberry, when you do find one it's a very nice taste with the peanut, but sadly, that's very rare.Avoid this variety."
1,Typical radio,"This is a very very typical radio-CD, as I use to call it. The songs on the CD are the same that are played over and over again on radios in Sweden. There's no need to buy the CD; all you have to do is turn on the radio and there you go. And to me, the music isn't special at all.This is of course very objectiv, but I suppose reviews shall be objectiv. If you are one of those who listens a lot to radio, and likes the music, you should buy this CD."
2,There are better books on this very interesting subject,"This books has some interesting material but lacks clarity, depth and focus. Basic explanations about a given subjects come often in the wrong order. Whenever the books attempt to explain anything, very little can actually be understood, as the author tries to keep the level of explanations too low, and therefore ultimately hopelessly useless. Written with the businessman mind, and not with a scientific one.Much better book are from Watson and Berry or from Ridley."
4,Took some getting used to...,"This was a bit different from my last sleep mask, but after the initial adjustment I love it. It's still a little tricky to sleep on my side with this on."
2,Pretty color,Pretty color - just don't like how they fit too well and that when I wake in the morning my eye hurts.
3,too bulky,"I didn't actually try sleeping in these because I'm returning it. The material is soft and it blocks out light. However I find these way too bulky. And given how uncomfortable the velcro strap is on the other style of bucky eyeshades I tried, I think these would have the same problem. I also don't like the pocket in the front - it looks dorky. It's dorky looking enough to have to wear eyeshades while sleeping; I'd rather not have a pocket on the front as well."
1,Ugh...just Ugh,"This design sucks. There's a huge stuffed roll at the bottom of the mask that is supposed to keep the mask itself off your eyes. What actually happens in the roll ends up on your eyes. The strap is fat and it's stiff, making it completely uncomfortable. From someone who sleeps in a mask every night, this is NOT the one to pick."
4,Hatley M,"I was a total Bucky fan until I found Dreamessentails.com. Having had my Buckys wear out after a few years in elastic, and not liking the feel of the elastic band on the back of my head, I went to dreamessentials.com, which is better than Buckys. Hard to believe because I was a Buckys convert, but dreamessentials has the same design layout, provides the ear plugs, and has a wonderful flat strip in the back and sides of your head with just two small velcro attachments for fit that you cannot feel. I sleep with all the comfort of Buckys, but none of the strap draw backs, plus my dream essentials have lasted me for at least 8 or 9 years now for about $23.00.Looking back, dreamessentials has even more options, such as interchangeable aromatherapy packs such as lavender, etc. to help sleep as well. I will always love my Buckys, however, dreamessentials has taken their place in my drawer, and I have created many additional fans as well.Check out [...]"
4,Great Mask,"Very comfortable and like the earplug pouch in front. The Luxury Mask is more comfortable on the back strap, but this is the third pair of Bucky Eyeshades we've had and my they travel well and wash up nicely."
5,Best Travel Mask,"I'm a frequent flier and have tried numerous travel masks. This one is super comfortable and superior to all others. It blocks 100% of the light. Well worth paying a little extra! Just add Bose headphones and turn them on, but leave them unplugged, to shield the noise!"
3,hmmm,You would think the velcro on the straps is a good idea but I did not like it because you could feel it when you layed your head on the pillow.
5,eye shades-room darkening,Bucky has very good products. These room darkening shades are excellent. I've been using these for years to block out the light coming through the windows at night.
3,Disappointed,This product does cut out all light - if you can keep in place. Evidently I move around too much to keep it where it should be and wake up with it moved too far upward. I gave two of these to friends who travel a lot and am hoping it works for them.
4,Good sleep mask choice,This is my second favorite sleep mask. Good coverage and comfortable. If you don't mind the mask actually contacting your eyes then this is a viable choice.
5,The best eye mask for airplane flights ever!,"For years I relied on free eye masks handed out by airlines, then I bought various fancy ones from spas and health food stores. None of them worked as well as this Bucky. I resisted the price ($25) at first, but now find that it is worth every penny. Buy the Bucky that has a tiny pocket for earplugs - it comes with earplugs that are strung together so you won't lose them. As a frequent flyer who takes red eye flights, this is utterly indispensable."
5,I can't sleep without them....,"A friend (who knew I liked a good eyeshade for sleeping) bought me some of these from the States. They are THE most comfortable, blackout shades I have ever used. What more can I say? I am a Bucky eyeshade junkie - about to buy a backup set (cause I can't sleep right without them). Did I mention they were comfortable?"
1,Hurts My Eyes,"The sleep mask has a thick ridge on the inside bottom designed to help block the light. The only problem is that the mask tends to adjust itself upward on my face so that the ridge is either right underneath my eyes or actually on my eyes, creating very uncomfortable pressure. I sleep better with light than with these."
3,didn't fit,"Didn't fit my head but it did fit my husband's okay. Did slide around a little but when I made it tighter, it bothered me. Blocks out light better than other ones I've tried but not a perfect fit for me."
2,HUGE size,I ordered these as a Christmas present for my husband who travels but ended up returning them due to their enormous size. They probably work really well to block out any and all light (they are so big and thick I can't imagine them not) but I would hardly call them travel size. If you're looking for something small and low profile these are definitely not it.
4,Non-traditional Travel Ideas,"There are so many places I want to explore that I never thought of arranging my travel around quirky games. Maybe this book is for those who travel constantly and want a fresh way to explore a destination.The book gives ideas like exploring a city by song lyrics or chess moves. Then it reports on actual travelers who have tried it. Maybe this book would suit my friend who wears Groucho glasses/nose to meet visitors at the airport.I give the book four stars since Lonely Planet breaks ground with its travel books. Deducted one star, because I think the audience is pretty limited for travel this specialized."
3,"Some good ideas, but extremely pretentious","Almost everyone begins to tire of the city they live in after a few years. ""There's just nothing to do here"" and ""God, this place is boring"" start to become regular utterances to friends and family. What to do?Well, Lonely Planet has put out this book. It consists of a collection of travel 'experiments', which are actually just games, to make your travels at home and away a bit more enjoyable. I'm not going to lie. Some of these games seem boring and stupid, but there are enough good ideas here to warrant reading the book.The only quibble I have is the excessive pretension on the part of the authors. Instead of just presenting these games as they are, theyt insist on cloaking their actions in metaphysical double-speak and an excessive amount of self-importance. I really could have done without that.On the whole though, this is a decent book, and I'm glad to see Lonely Planet is branching out."
1,CRAP!,"Can't imagine what drugs Bill was on when he compiled this Album. One star is too many! ""Tone"" & ""Music I Heard"" are without a doubt the worst part, but the whole thing stinks! The title tune is bearable. What was he thinking?"
5,An inexpensive way to purchase GOOD colored pencils for classroom use,These pencils are encased in a sturdy box with dividers between each color. The pencils are the same high quality pencils that the smaller packs have. A bonus is the pencil sharpeners that come with this pack. I would highly recommend this pack for any educator or even a group of parents who want to divide these and dramatically reduce the cost of their school supplies while still providing high quality materials to their children.
5,Geography Class,"I bought this large box of Crayola Colored Pencils for my elementary kids intro to geography. These pencils were great for mapping and coloring flags. The colors were vibrant and the pencils very durable. I went a little overboard and put the map pencils in a plastic check pouch with other supplies such as white Pearl erasers, writing pencils, pencil sharpener, sticker passport, play compass, global stickers, pretend money... The kids very much liked having all their supplies ready to go for each class and were super excited to take everything home for more fun in the summer."
5,Kindle's the Best,I received a Kindle for Christmas and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the ability to shop for books from home and receive them instantly. My first purchase was James Rollins' Altar of Eden and was very pleased with how quickly it was shipped to my Kindle and how customer service promptly worked to eliminate the typos. I look forward to many years of enjoyment with my Kindle.
4,"Perfect, but no images and illustrations in subscriptions","The Kindle is a very good product, but my only regret is the text-only subscriptions (magazines and newspapers)."
5,I'm in love with an inanimate object!,"I received my kindle 2 for my bithday about 2 weeks ago. I love it! I use it daily and love having it with me in my purse. I really agonized over the kindle vs the nook, but after reading many pc magazines comparing the two, I went with kindle. One of the reasons was that the pages ""turn"" very quickly something I read the nook takes 2 or 3 seconds to do. If you're a fast reader that would be annoying.I was also pleasantly surprised to find the basic web browser is very adequate to check my personal e mail or look up a movie or phone number. I wasn't expecting that capability. The dictionary is also a big help. The only complaint I would have is that I'd like a little more contrast on the sceen. The page could be just a tad lighter.I've downloaded some bestsellers and some free classics, bought a beautiful Monet ""skin"" and a bright orange zippered case. If you love to read and always like having something with you, buy it! It's the best!"
5,I LOVE this product!,"I purchased the 2nd Generation Kindle about 6 weeks ago and I love it! I am currently reading my 3rd novel and it is so easy to search for a book, download it and read it at my convenience. My 6 year old even asked me to download a book for him and he had his book read in one evening! I would highly recommend this product."
5,I'm in Love with my Kindle,"Received this as a gift from my very generous sister. She had one and loved it, I was skeptical. After about an hour, I was hooked. I read more, am amazed at how easy it is to download, no matter where I am. I am the envy of all my friends and would highly recommend getting one, if you're sitting on the fence.Had an opportunity to use my sister's older version while we were on vacation together, mine is far superior. The improvements to this version are significant and make the entire experience more pleasureable.Only downside, you can't share books after you have read them. Don't feel that is fare, but still wouldn't be enough to change my mind on how in love I am with my newest gaget!"
4,Kindle 2 Review,I have been very pleased with my Kindle 2. I am a frequent business traveler. Having the Kindle has allowed me to carry virtually any set of books I want. The Digital Ink and Paper technology is great. I am not subscribing to the newspaapers yet as I feel publications like Wall Street Journal are still over priced.
4,Rural & suburban users beware: NO Wireless coverage!,"We liked the device overall but there is a huge flaw: this device is called ""Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device"", but when you try to connect wirelessly to it, unless you live in city or a densely populated area, it won't work!Rural and sub-urban folks beware: this device won't work as advertised, and will revert you to use it as you would use an ipod or other e-readers, connect through USB, launch your web browser, log in to amazon, go to your kindle account, download the book, transfer it to your kindle, and hope there are no glitches in the process!!!From a 1 step ""wireless e-reader"" download, rural folks and sub-urban dwellers are stuck with a 1990's e-book reader that needs a computer, an internet connection and some tech know-how to download books...Amazon must be more forthcoming about this fact!Other than that, the reader works as you'll expect it."
3,Kindle needs a version with easier-to-view controls,"My brothers and I just purchased a Kindle 2 for our mother, whose eyesight is no longer very good. While the Kindle 2's large type feature and read-aloud feature will be great for her, I was very disappointed with the controls. The letters on the keyboard are TINY, and the controls along the sides are very hard to see too.I can understand why Kindle wants to look ""cool""; but, considering the segment of their audience that needs large print, why don't they come out with a version of the exterior that is friendly to those with poor eyesight? My mother may end up needing help on her Kindle every time she wants to do any navigating, searching, volume control etc. That's a shame! -- with such great features, they should be more accessible to their eyesight-impaired audience."
1,Buyer beware!,"The device itself is fine. I purchased it for my then computer-illiterate wife who was reluctant to use such a device, registering it on my Amazon account. After much use, she became to like the device and has become an avid user. Instead of continuing to use my Amazon account to order books, she wanted to be able to do so on her Amazon account. I sent an email to Amazon asking to how to transfer the kindle account to her, and instructions were received to deregister it from my account and register it on hers. We did so, and then found out that none of the many books we purchased were accessible! After then calling Amazon, we found out that you cannot transfer purchased content from on account to another! This was not at all indicated in the email that Amazon sent, and is a major dissapointment."
5,Great Product,"I love it...Have read 3 books so far. Words are clear and buttons easy to use. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys reading. Takes up alot less space that all those paperback books I used to buy. Downloading from the Kindle store is quick, easy and resonably priced."
4,Love My Kindle,"Finally, made the decision to buy a Kindle...worried that I would not like reading from it as I enjoy the comforts of a good book. Not to worry...found myself so lost in my 'book' that I was reaching up to turn the page, unaware that it was not a paper book. Easy to read, light, and compact.I didn't give it 5 stars because I live in an area where there is no cell signal and thus, no 'whispernet'. I have to go to an area where I can receive a signal to use all the Kindle features, but that's a minor inconvenience."
4,"No light, really?","I love everything about the Kindle, except for one thing. There is no light to read it in dark areas. I realize a regular book does not have a light either, but I expected it on the Kindle. I still have to attach a reading light to a product that has it's own power source. That was a disappointment."
3,What's new?,"I received my Kindle as a gift and was pretty excited about it considering all the buzz I had heard. Technologically it didn't live up to the buzz.Don't get me wrong, it works. I also think its a great way to keep up with magazines and newspapers. It keeps them available in a tiny, easily transported and accessible location. As a reader, though, its stodgy.Its slow to react. The 5 way button first lags, then jumps beyond your target point. Why no touch screen? This is 2009, not 1999. Its thin profile aside, the technology is disappointingly dated. If you have been around tech a while and own an iPhone (even an iPod) you are going to find the operation clunky and reminiscent of the 90's.I believe the era of the e-reader is finally here and that, plus the very well conceived and executed Amazon shopping and delivery system, are the real reasons behind the Kindle's success. Sorry Amazon, the hardware platform is asynchronous by a decade."
3,Kindle in Australai,"Kindle is goodWhat's not good, after paying $30 USD for delivery, it took 15 days to get hereWhat's also not good is that I can't buy cuurent releases"
4,Love My Kindle,"I did a lot of research before I chose the Kindle 2 for my first wireless reader. I love it!! I took it on vacation last week and it exceeded my expectations. I sat on the beach and watched other readers try to keep the wind from blowing their pages and having to stop to turn pages with 2 hands and just smiled because I wasn't having any of those problems. No glare, no fuss with pages or marking where I stopped reading. The only thing I would like more would be a built in light."
5,Great Device,"iPad? Sure why not, but don't discount the Kindle with it's easy on-the-eyes display, dictionary and light weight design it reads in the sunlight as easy as it reads indoors without the bulk of an iPad.So, if you want an iPad that's great it's a wonderful device, but it's no substitute for the avid reader's indulgence like the Kindle; the two can coexist quite nicely."
4,I Love it!,I just got a Kindle for Christmas and I love it. I have ordered the New York Times subscription because I find the Kindle has organized the paper quite logically and made it easy to navigate the articles. Reading a book is quite comfortable on the Kindle. I only miss color graphics and color photographs but knowing Amazon that probably is in the pipeline. Thanks for a wonderful reading tool. It has enhanced my reading experience.
3,delicate product,"I had a Kindle which I really liked, but it died whenI dropped it on our lawn.A portable device shouldn't be that delicate."
5,Best Gift Ever!,"I have wanted a Kindle since they first came out. For Christmas, my dad received the Kindle 1 and after we explained to him what it was, it has been by his side ever since. He let me borrow it for a week and I was in love. A week later my husband suprised me with the best gift ever! My own Kindle 2!! I really love the ease of use and I find that I read books a bit faster with this just because I enjoy the experience so much! I love the selection of books as well as all of the books you can get for free! This is a great gadget for the avid reader!"
5,Kindle 2,"I am extremely pleased with my KIndle. It is very easy to navigate and the download is even faster than predicted. Also, with the Whispernet off, mine has kept the charge for three weeks! I am happy with the book choices and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a reader! Now if I need a new book to read I can have one in a jiffy."
3,Cheaper on paper,"I was going to buy this for my Mother since she reads all the time, she pointed out to me that it would cost her hundreds to be able to read the amount of books she is use to. I would have to agree, to buy just one book a week only costs her about $5 a month (She buys used) to buy the same amount of book's with kindle could cost as much as $100 a month. Don't get me wrong I think this is a great product and once they drop the price of older books down to about $1.00 each I guess my Mother will just keep reading paperbacks."
5,Great Customer Service and Warranty with Kindle!,"I have had my Kindle for about 3 or 4 months. One day I switched the power key and some of the screen saver froze and never went away. I was worried since I didnt have the box or reciepts, I would have to pay for another. Thankfully, that was not the case! I called and they are sending me another one in 2 days with it activated and my books already loaded on it! There's not more I could ask for out of them! I recommend the Kindle, not only because its awesome, but because of the ease of mind you can have with it! You don't have to worry about arguing with customer service to get you a replacement. They were more than happy to send me another with no charge! Thanks Amazon!"
4,Almost perfect!,"I like all of my ereaders, but I almost love my Kindle. I resisted buying one for a long time, until I found books in the Kindle store that I couldn't find anyplace else. I bought the books and read them on my PC, and I was enchanted by the Kindle software. It was so easy to use the dictionary, and so much easier than any other reader. I finally decided to buy a Kindle.Absolutely the greatest feature is to be able to sync between my phone, PC, and Kindle. I'm hooked! If you would support epub files and had a touch screen, I would pay anything you asked. I don't need color. A bigger Kindle, more like a tablet, would be a definite plus."
2,Good idea but bad business model,"I had a chance to use a kindle 2 for several days and I have to say that it was a convenient way to carry a lot of content. As some one who travels a lot it would be a good option although I don't see myself giving up the experience of reading a book entirely. Unfortunately the coercive avaricious, Steve Jobs style, ram it down your throat business model makes it a non starter. My hope is that some of the electronics manufacturers will work with the publishers to adopt a universal E read format Ala Blueray or MP3 so that we can get these devices at a more competitive price point and keep the content market separate. I want to be able to by a book in electronic form, move it from device to device and give it away when I no longer want it. Just as I do know with a traditional book. Sorry Kindle, the short and long term price is just to high."
2,holding out for the nook,"this looked appealing until i saw the barnes and noble nook being released at the end of the month. built on android, it's an unlocked and open technology meaning that you can put your own pdfs and content on it...it's also got a touch screen display. amazon - the kindle is great but you really need to step up your game to complete with this and the forthcoming apple tablet."
1,Shame on Amazon for Shafting Loyal Customers!,"I am a frequent and until-now happy customer of Amazon's, since Amazon began it's business. So I'm *very* disappointed in Amazon's roll out of the new 9.5"" screen Kindle DX. Only four week's ago I bought the highly touted Kindle for my father's 83rd birthday. His mind is strong but his reading vision getting week. The Kindle was just the ticket. Had I known of the DX Kindle, 2.5 times bigger yet only about $135 more than the regular Kindle, that is exactly what I'd given my father. Solution: Amazon needs to let people like me return the little Kindle, pay the extra $135 or so, and receive the DX early this summer. Apple learned quick how fast rabid supporters would turn when it dramatically dropped the iPhone's price, leaving thousands of customers feeling like rubes and chumps. ARE YOU LISTENING, AMAZON? You can take the high road and solidify customer loyalty. Or ........"
1,Not a good device for consumers.,"The Kindle 2 originally shipped with the ability to turn your purchased books into a listenable form via text-to-speech. This is akin to having a family member or friend reading aloud to you.The Authors Guild felt that this threatened the sales of audiobooks and pressured Amazon into removing the feature. Amazon capitulated and crippled the Kindle by allowing authors to disable text-to-speech.The willingness of Amazon to appease the Authors Guild at the detriment of their customers makes this a risky purchase.I advise that until this product is no longer defective by Amazon's own design, you do not purchase it."
1,kindle sale hoax,I wasted my time for the sale to begin and hit the buy button as soon as it came on.No kindle for me.Tried to get on waiting list. not possible.Called customer service and was told item was sold out.Must have only been one kindle on sale.Customer service operator said she had tried to make same purchase too to no avail.Disgusted and fed up with Amazon.Don't waste any time with these shysters
2,Needs Zoom function ASAP!,"Amazon Kindle developers, this review is for you!For reading and carrying print, the Kindle can't be beat; everyone knows that.However, lack of a zoom function is holding back an *enormous* and profitable segment of the potential Kindle-buying public--the manga/graphic novel fans.Everywhere I go, I read laments about the unreadability of print in the tiny graphic images, even on the DX or Kindle for PC. It mirrors my own experience.The moment a zoom function is available, watch the word shoot out at the speed of light, and a whole new market open up! Really, I'd rather buy and store my manga digitally, but for now I'm holding off. I'm far from alone. And I'm a middle aged woman with lots of disposable income that I would love to spend on this medium.The ball's in your court, Amazon!"
2,Kindle thoughts,"I love reading and am only somewhat disappointed by the Kindle. It's very difficult to go back in a story to look for some info at the beginning or check out something in the middle. And I'm just talking about novels....must be tough with research. Have not been able to return to my farthest point read. I don't like not knowing how many pages I have to go. I suppose this is relatively minor but annoying nonetheless. Would appreciate back lighting to read in bed without bothering anyone. If prices go up on e books, I'll go back to normal books."
2,Cant read pdf well,"Its very good to read ebooks, but just impossible read pdf format because text are very small and i cant make zoom or read any daily articles. Also it could have a pen to bookmark or touch screen. I think sold it and acquire one ebook reader were i could reaad my medical articles and reviews. Also pictures in newpapers are rare. When i purchase this kindle 6"" the DX was not available to Europe. I think that in 2010 new ebook readers with more performances arrived. However i must say that screen, e ink and global wireless from amazon is very good and fast."
3,"Good device, limited material","I find the new Kindle very easy to use and basically an excellent system. However, two of the first four books that I have tried to download turn out not to be available on Kindle. All were new books published in 2009. Three of the books I sought were non-fiction, highly rated in recent media, and two of those are unavailable on Kindle. One of the two I did get was a boiler plate popular mystery. Fine, but if only current popular fiction is going to be reliably available, I am not sure that I made a good investment."
3,Subscriptions when traveling abroad,"When traveling abroad, Amazon sends a reduced content version of subscriptions (Economist) via whispernet charging $1.99 per download or $4.99/week forall subscriptions. This version excludes the cover, pictures and graphs.It is inadmissible that they pretend to charge more for less. If my subscription is in the US, why should I get the international version (as they like to call it)? It is really the rip-off version. I would accept to receive the reduced version if it were free to download anywhere.The file size they send is 260 Kb instead of the usual 3.4Mb file, so they are saving on the cost of data sent but pretend for us to pay an extra $1.99 per download or the extra weekly rate.Even if you download via USB when abroad you get this reduced version.The worst is that Amazon is so obscure with this issue and Customer Service is useless and pretend we are retarded or don't understand what they are doing. I have contacted them 4 times with no logical response."
5,Kindle 2.0,"I recieved my Kindle 2 last month, Im going to keep it short and sweet. I love it!!! If you love to read books, Get one. I also like that the screen is easy on the eyes, I use reading glasses to read my books i already have. With my books on kindle i dont need them, Coolest thing i have ever owned."
1,Beware clipping limits!!!,"If you want to use this for business books and want to clip and transfer portions, know there is a limit. Also, Kindle support is really awful. When I mentioned that there was no mention of a clipping limit I was told that they didn't say there wasn't either. Great customer service - NOT."
4,Text to Speech,How can you advertise text to speech and then take it away. That is the reason I finally decided to buy the Kindle. I can download to IPOD and read just as well. I am really disappointed.
1,Flawed Device,I used the Kindle2 for a couple weeks before finding the device impossible to use. The user experience of the device is difficult to manage. The documentation sparse. Digital content management difficult. I'll wait (maybe forever) for a similar device from Apple.
1,No Big Brother Deletes for Me,"I was considering purchasing a Kindle when I learned that Amazon can delete books from the Kindle without warning anytime it wants to. No thanks, Amazon, your Big Brother business model does not work for me."
4,Kindle,"Love the concept, and for reading books its great..... Claims to be able to store and play music, but I can't figure this out as the instructions for adding it are simple, but the links don't work of the Kindle... I really liked the idea of emailing myself documents and spreadsheetto read, but didn't realize I was being charged to download them.... Bottom line, Love the Reading portion, hate the stuff that doesn't work properly and they charge for...."
5,Kindlec2,"I like the size, shape ands feel on my Kindle. It weighs just 0.2oz over a pound and is easier to hold and read than the average book I read. The book I'm reading now in print is much larger and weighs 2+ pounds. The eInk is easy to read with good adjustability options. I do hope there will eventually be a firmware upgrade to allow the user to move around to find tables, illustrations, index and index items. It's a fun if fairly expensive way to read. It will take some time for the relatively inexpensive book purchases to pay for the investment. Not all books I've looked for are in the Kindle format but when you search Amazon.com there is an automatic link to the publisher to allow you to express your desire tho buy the book in Kindle. A good gift for someone special who likes to read."
4,Not bad,"Product was great, but lack of PDF support made me switch to another brand. The scheme of emailing PDF files to Amazon, have them converted and returned has some problems. 1)You can only email files as large as your email client will let you send (~25 MB) which exempted many of my files. Also, my technical documents have many equations, none of which survived conversion. I went with a product that did have native PDF support."
5,Amazing little device!,I've been interested in the Kindle even since I first saw it on Oprah. When I discovered my local newspaper is now available I decided to buy a Kindle. I'm so glad I did! I've only had it for 6 days and I love it! I now get my newspaper every morning at 6 a.m. to enjoy with my coffee. I'm also trying a couple of magazines and found Suduko and will try the crossword puzzles. No books yet but I'll try some soon. The problem is I don't have enough time to read.
5,great purchase!,"I absolutely love my kindle, I have had it for over a month now and I couldn't be happier! If you like to read and you like to take your book with you this is perfect. It is slim and fits right in my purse. I purchased the kindle case with it and I am happy with all of it! One thing that really impressed me is that is not as delicate as I originally thought. I was worried that with two kids I would have to take extra care with it, but with the case it does not feel as delicate and it seems more protected! I would definitely recommend getting the kindle case! It keeps it safe in my purse that goes everywhere with me!"
4,Kindle 2,I spent alot of time reading reviews before deciding to get a Kindle. I really love being able to toss it in my bag and take it with me. Having my books on it to read again if I want to is great. It is great not having to give them away because I have run out of shelves to put them on. I too wish their was some sort of folder system to use on the Kindle. I love being able to make notes. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my wireless really sucks. I called Amazon and the tech talked me through changing to AT&T but it still doesn't work well. I don't understand why because I have an AT&T phone which works great. I am hoping they are going to improve on that. I was hoping to shop and download my books directly from the Kindle but have to use my computer. If I had known how bad the wireless was going to be I am not sure I would have ordered it.
4,Kindle,"I absolutely love my Kindle. I carry it with me everywhere. It's like my cell phone as far as I have to have it with me. I find it easier to read than a regular book. Before I bought it, I was afraid I would not feel like I was reading a book. But, it's so much easier. I would recommend anyone that is a book lover to buy this. It is amazing how easy it is to find books and load them. I can't imagine not having my Kindle."
1,Kindle Books too expensive,"I was always interested in Kindle. When it became available in Europe, I bought the Kindle with hopes of abundant and good priced books. However, the reality hit me only after I ordered.1- You can only order this from Amazon.com. Not from Amazon.de, not from Amazon.co.uk. So you have to pay heaps of money for ""import tax"". Why can't a company like Amazon solve this? It is almost a hidden cost.2- Books are generally more expensive than their paperback versions. Unless you like reading books written gazillion years ago. Why oh why? Isn't wireless delivery cheaper than printing the book?3- The titles in Europe are restricted ""due to copyright reasons"". So if you want to read new bestsellers, even if you are willing to pay more than the paperback, no luck.I hope the introduction of another decent competitor like Apple will shake things up.I do not recommend you to buy this product. Especially of you are living in Europe."
3,"The good, bad, and the ugly","Pros:Convenient to buy books at a whim.Convenient to review books.Convenient to store and read multiple books.Cons:Expensive (you can buy a lot of books for the price of the unit).Not able to share books with friends.Not able to sell/donate books when finished.Proprietary format of books.Limited magazine and newspaper selection (all of at a cost).If you like traditional books, this is not for you."
5,My Favorite Purchase in Years,"I have wanted a Kindle since ebook readers came out. I researched them and waited until I could talk to someone who owned one. I looked at more than the Kindle and decided it was the best for me as I travel a fair bit.I had it for about 4 days without a cover and I felt that it was quite fragile (even if it wasn't, I kept thinking it was), so I would recommend you buy a cover when you by the reader. I bought an M-edge Latitude (if you like to read in the tub, I'd get the M-edge Gardian). The cover makes it so much better for reading while moving about.I don't leave the house without my Kindle. I am still learning how to move about the home screen and how to organize. I would have preferred a written manual vs an online electronic guide but that's me.It is a fantastic tool and I just love it."
5,A new love affair,"I love my Kindle and it goes with me everywhere I go. Mine is the smaller version and it is perfect. Just the right size to tuck in my purse and take it anywhere. I love the fact that you are constantly adding to the listings available and the number is posted on the Kindle. There are many applications to this product, most of which I have not yet begun to tap into. The book that I am currently reading has a lot of big words in it, and I really appreciated the dictionary available at one click, without losing my place. It is really fun to show this wonderful device to friends and watch them get excited. Thank you, Amazon, for a wonderful product."
5,Love the kindle,Great condition was a bit worried when I found out its used but looks brand new an love it. Glad I got it well worth the money!!!!
4,Bought in 2009 - Still Ticking,"This 2nd generation kindle is still working fabulously for my wife. It has endured a lot of use. Although it is cracked where it connects to its cover, it has been a reliable reading tool that my continues to enjoy."
1,buyer beware,"Our new Kindle 2 had a software problem.For instance, if you turn off your Kindle 2 with a full battery or partly filled battery, next time you try to use your Kindle 2 the battery will be dead. We often put our Kindle 2 on the dining room table where it is untouched by anyone. after a few hours or less it will turn itself on and run the battery down.WE ARE NOW ON OUR 4TH KINDLE 2now here is where we get cheated. We paid full price for a new Kindle 2. We just learned that our replacement Kindle 2 units are used or refurbished units. One would think that you would get a replacement of equal value.THIS WILL BE OUR LAST KINDLE"
3,"Works ok, but with frustrating limitations","I purchased this for my wife for mother's day. She's been wanting one for some time. She was delighted when she opened the box, but was disappointed that she was not able to get some new titles she was really looking forward to due to whatever legal bickering is going on between Amazon and publishers. Also, the inability to use library downloads on the device just plain sucks.I don't know that much about these issues, and don't care to, but on the face of it Amazon seems to me to be kind of Ipod-esque in its selfish exclusivity and refusal to work with other devices, formats and materials."
5,Quite Enjoyable ...,I have had it about two months now. I really like it. I have nothing else to compare it to since I've never owned an e-book reader before. I have mine decorated with a skin I bought offline and a leather case that I ordered from Amazon. It's so unique and portable. No trouble fitting it in my bag along with my netbook. I have trouble lifting heavy things and this is just as light as can be. I really am enjoying it. Along with downloading the free Kindle books from this site. Ha.
5,Best Product,This is the best product I have ever bought. No more books on shelves. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,A word of warning for spanish readers,"If I was an english-only reader I would gladly rate the Kindle 2 with 5 stars. But being an spanish reader my first experience with the catalogue of books in spanish offered by Amazon was extremely disappointing. Only a few ones and many of them are ""about"" spanish but not ""in"" spanish.This said, I also admit that the vast catalogue of classic books written in spanish that are available for free can be converted to PDF and easily uploaded to the Kindle. I have reading material for many years to come!Now, if your interest in spanish literature are most towards modern writers (or books translated from other languages into spanish) you should consider other readers that accept the ePub standard.Being an Amazon loyal customer my wish is that Amazon could improve their spanish books catalogue (or open the Kindle to support the ePub, if this is possible at all...)Manuel"
1,Kindle Huge disapppointment,"It is with much sorrow that I have to submit a poor review for the Kindle. I purchased the product with high hopes and was at all times trying to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" however the product failed on a number of fundamental levels.In more detail let me say that when the product is working it is great. I enjoyed the ability to download anywhere and the ""read-a-bility"" was great. However the first Kindle I got froze up. I was told this was unusal and Amazon agreed to replace it at not cost to me. The second one also froze up. In the meantime my father in law also was in discussions with Amazon about his Kindle freezing up. By the time I received my thir Kindle I had lost all interest,. Why download something when the item usually takes around 3 days to stop working!"
3,Global Edition Kindle Now Requires Subscription Fee to Receive Wirelessly Abroad,"Last couple of weeks, I received a notice that Amazon is now assessing $4.99/week to receive my subscriptions (Wall Street, other subscriptions). While I'm a US citizen, I am living and working in India and bought this global edition when I already had the US Edition to receive the subscriptions wirelessly instead of having to download using the computer. Now, I will be using the computer again to receive the subscriptions.In addition, if that wasn't enough, now $1.99 will be added on to the costs to receive books or single issue peridocals. Again, these will be downloaded via computer as well now and to have a global edition vs. US edition is hardly worth the additional purchase. I can't wait for competition to enter this space."
2,Man this thing is delicate!,"I absolutely love my Kindle 2 and love being able to read anytime on the go. I do have to throw out there, however, that this thing is FRAGILE! I just got my FOURTH device. Any flex at all and the screen goes kaput. I love the device, but I think maybe I need to get some sort of hard case for it as I have broken three of them in 6 months."
3,My eyes are not what they used to be,"Yes, you can change the size of the text so that you can see it, but the screen size is too small to allow more than a couple of lines of text with the larger text sizes. The screen shows text as black on off-white, and I believe that the text would be easier to discern if the off-white were lighter and closer to white.Also, one week ago I received an e-mail from amazon saying that they had a software update they wanted to put in place right now, and I haven't seen it yet. This tends to make it so that I loose trust in what they are saying."
5,"A great 'take it with you"" library!",Great product! It allows me to build a library that I can carry in my pocket. Love it!
2,CAUTION before buying a kindle,"I purchased the Kindle as a Christmas gift for my wife. She has enjoyed it the past few months; however, due to disagreements between Amazon and several publishers, THERE ARE MUTILPLE BOOKS FROM POPULAR AUTHORS THAT WILL NOT BE AVAILBLE ON THE KINDLE. She has already missed out on four titles in the past month. They are all available on the nook and iPad for $12.99 each. I understand that Amazon is trying to take a stand with the publishers, but unfortunately Kindle owners are the ones suffering. I am now tempted to purchase a different eBook device for my wife and close my Amazon account."
2,Went through 3 in 3 months,"Love the product, it makes reading much more comfortable...but jeez is it delicate!!!I got my first kindle for christmas and I dropped it on the carpet while it was in my bag and the screen cracked and went black.I called customer service and they sent me a replacement free of charge.So i bought a nice case and kept it on my bookshelfand a month later i open it and its cracked, it didn't even get dropped!so now that my latest one cracked of its own accord once again, i am getting a refund!i might buy another one if they were less fragile."
3,Fantasy fiction? Not on the Kindle!!!!!,"If you love science or fantasy fiction, don't even think about getting the Kindle. Apparently, even though they don't show it anywhere on the site, Amazon has dropped e-books from Tor. I researched which e-book reader I wanted to get for Christmas, and I loved my kindle, but if anyone had told me that within a month after getting it, I would no longer be able to read the type of books I want to read on it, I would have gone with a different e-reader that was not associated with Amazon. They SAY they have all the books you want to read, but apparently that only holds true for people who aren't interested in the fantasy genre! Again, I warn you - if Jordan or Sanderson or any Tor authors are your favorites, DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Kindle Redefines What It Means To Own A Book,"Typically, when you purchase a book, loaning it is a no-brainer. There are five people in my family, so if one of us were to buy a book, and wanted to share it with the others, unless we shared the same account, we'd have to either buy five copies or not use our kindle when someone else is reading our book. This makes loaning books to friends extremely unlikely. So while it looks as if you're getting a bargain when you buy a new book, in terms of the cost per reader, it is quite expensive.It would make sense to permit books to be transferred to others without any cost, provided that the book could only be opened by one kindle at one time.I am a voracious reader, but until that happens, I'm not buying one."
1,More books are needed urgently.,"Like many, I was unaware that the International version of the Kindle doesn't have the same book availability as the US version.The lack of books, especially the latest ones, makes this pretty useless at this time in Australia.Amazon seriously need to rectify this in a hurry. For now.. don't bother with the Kindle if you're not in the US."
4,Christmas Gift,"I purchased the Kindle for my wife's Christmas gift. As such I have not personally checked it out. If there's a problem, its all the emails I'm getting that hopefully I intercept before you let the ""cat out of the bag."""
5,Kindle Review,"I have had my kindle for a short period of time, but I have died and gone to BOOK HEAVEN!!! I am an avid reader and the Kindle is now my wonderful book of all books. How fast the books arrive - I have always hated waiting on books that I ordered via mail. This certainly suits my lifestyle and I know I will never be without a kindle.When I decided to invest in an e-book reader, I did research on the Kindle and the Sony model. I am glad that I decided on the Kindle - it is everything and more than I anticipated.ThanksNancy"
4,Pro's and con's,"As a whole, I really like my Kindle.Purchasing books is very easy, though navigating through the selection of books on Amazon is a little difficult. It would be nice if they offered the listings in an additional manner...ie: according to cost, etc. With the amount of reading I do, it gets rather expensive at $9.99 each, when there are many books available at no cost to download, but they are difficult and time consuming to find.It is very nice to read in bed, as it is light-weight and getting comfortable doesn't have to include positions where it is difficult to turn pages......one click with either hand and you are on to the next page. Very convenient.My only real complaint is that there is no internal light. Obviously the technology is available and I do not understand why this isn't standard. A clip-on light works, but it makes the Kindle heavier and has to be adjusted perfectly to not glare off the screen.Would I buy it again? Yes. Could there be some improvements? Yes."
5,love that kindle,"I love this thing. I have arthritis in my thumbs and reading myself to sleep was getting harder to do. I can read all night now, if I want to because it weighs next to nothing. I also really enjoy being able to have immediate access to a purchase and that I don't need a computer to download. I think I will save money on downloads versus books but maybe not - I may buy more books!"
5,Much improved Kindle,I replaced my first-generation Kindle with this new much improved version. I'm delighted with the thinner model and with the improvements made for navigation. In the last two years I've become very dependent on the Kindle both at home and on my travels.
5,"Fantastic!! A little late for review, but great.","Yep, we bough it at the peak of pricing, but, she wanted it, we got it, and it was well worth it. Still going strong. Just got the Kindle Fire for xmas. Love it too. For someone not sure if they'll like a Kindle, or similiar, get this one now, at less than $100 I believe. They're great."
5,One of the best inventions ever,I totally love my Kindle. Especially when you're traveling and can't get to a book store. I would never be without it. Where ever I go I have a book to read.
5,$500 FREE from Kindle!!,"I purchased the Kindle for myself for X-mas and love it!! I used to purchase the New York Times everday plus Sundays.My yearly cost for the NYTimes amounted to $785,minus the special cost of $260 for the Kindle, I figured Amazon has paid me $525 to own the Kindle.Thank you Amazon, and I will use my FREE gift to purchase books,magazines, and other newspapers.R.Moran Altoona,Pa"
2,Whispernet should expand...,"I was so very disappointed in my new Kindle2. I live in a rural area and coverage is not available here or either so slow its taking forever for my book to download. I've even tried to download straight from my computer to my Kindle but no success. I can read the Oxford Dictionary that came installed on it, but thats all. Unless I go into an area that it will work, I am out of luck. I bought this because I don't go out much and purchasing books or going to the library is difficult. I like to travel but some places I go may not be able to get Whispernet service either. This is such a wonderful invention, I hate it is not working. I've only had it for 24 hours, but may be returning it for a prompt refund along with the cover I just purchased to keep it nice and protected."
4,Kindle,"Our family is a family of readers. We like the smell, the heft,the paper, the font of books; we didn't think we would like anelectronic book like Amazon Kindle. Boy, were we wrong! It's greatto carry around and to be able to choose one of the many books,magazines, newspapers that are ""in"" the Kindle.Only one drawback I've noticed. I'm reading ""The Kingdom of GodIs Within You"" by Tolstoy and I am a little put off by the ""typos""or mispellings in the translation.Nathan Simmons"
5,kindle : excellent product!,This product is brilliant yet so simple.I was worried at first that it will just be another techie gadjet but its so damn convenient.I travel to work on the train and it means i dont have to lug any books with me.plus my wife gets annoyed as have so many books around the house so this will go some way to help and also in a small way help save a few trees.
5,Kindle Lover,"I finally bought the Kindle after a year of comparing ereaders. After purchasing and using the Kindle, I know I made the right decision.The ease of operating the Kindle and the selection of ebooks available for 9.99, helps in making the Kindle a cherished part of my life."
2,Amazon' Kindle,Too pricy. This technology is evolving and encouraging but should be far less than $300 and I definitely think Sony will bring it down over the next few months. I would wait for the price to come down to between $100 - $150.
1,Malfunctions,"I purchased a Kindle I for my husband. He likes it, so I purchased a Kindle 2 for myself. After a week of using it, it lost its charge and no matter how I tried to juice it, it wouldn't charge. I called Amazon, sent it back and they replaced it, with no problem. The same thing happened! I called, got it replaced again, and now I'm holding my breath that this one works. According to Amazon, this is not a universal problem with Kindle 2, this is the first they've heard of it."
2,REALLY expensive way to read!,Very $$$ way to read! Great tool but ONLY if you normally purchase hard back books and have a year or so to realize the savings. If you read paperbacks it's cheaper to just buy them from Amazon or your local used paperback bookstore.
1,If you make too many returns your Kindle may become a brick,"Just read an article that if you get banned from Amazon for any reason, your Kindle essentially becomes useless since you can't log into your account. One guy had a few too many returns on purchased items and Amazon unilaterally banned him without warning.It kept him from being able to even access the books he already purchased. They finally resolved it after a few phone calls but reserved the right to ban him again. I am in no danger as one, I have never made any returns, and two, I do not own a Kindle. With this type of policy I may never own one."
2,Kindle,"This product is ok, not worth the price. You would think that it would have an internal light to read in low light, but no, you have to purchase a separate funky light to hang on it. I would not have purchased it if I had know this. I wanted to be able to read on a plane or on the couch without turning on a light."
2,Fun while it lasted,"I have the first version kindle from july 08. 2 months after the 1 year warranty the screen is dead. It looks like a barcode. I had the best cover for it, stored it carefully but I guess not enough. The screen is very very delicate despite its looks that it is. Treat it like you are carrying around a pane of glass. *After talking with amazon cs it seems kindle wants to go down the ipod route and have people replace kindles then for them to fix. --sad kindle owner"
1,Not Buying till DELETE CONTENT is Gone,"We don't need Amazon playing big brother and violating the user agreement by deleting digital content remotely. That feature needs to be eliminated from the software! This opens the way to digital censorship as well as a loss of privacy.Until Amazon gets it's act together, I'm not interested in ""sort of "" buying digital content! Google the web, you'll see what they did to ""1984""."
1,1984 has become true - we are being controlled,Amazon has the option to delete books from that device which you officially bought and paid for. This is open censorship and a device allowing that cannot be tolerated - one star is even too much
1,Horrendus,"The Amazon Kindle, in all revisions and versions, carries a terribly abusive and restrictive use policy, as well as highly intrusive software. According to Amazon policy, the user of the Kindle may have books or other software removed or altered without their approval or ability to intervene. Such a device is an abomination, as it removes fundamental controls from the hands of the owner. I would not consider purchasing the Kindle unless Amazon removes all DRM (digital rights management) measures from the device, as well as every form of invasive software present on the device, in addition to removing the section allowing such actions from its user agreement."
1,Frustrating,"This product has too tight a grip on your ebooks through draconian DRM. Well, forget the books are yours, they aren't, as recent events proved (Orwell books silently and remotely deleted). This is still an overpriced product for what it does, recommend looking elsewhere - Kindle is not the only eBook reader, and is not the best either, in case you wondered."
1,Horror stories,"This is a truly horrid product for a number of reasons:1) Some of the more objective reviews relate customer service disasters,2) The Kindle 2 software deleting user-owned content3) The inability of the Kindle 2 software to automatically accept K1 content without a very painful hassle on the user's part4) Lack of interoperability with the Kindle 1 and other possible devices, like the iTouch; and5) The crippling DRM, even on material that is no longer under copyrightI can only conclude that buying/using/recommending the Kindle 2 or any Amazon service is a very bad idea."
1,"Cool device, incredibly fragile","When I first got this device, I loved it. It is a truly innovative device with several amazing features, beyond the ability to take your library anywhere you go. However, it is incredibly fragile. My screen cracked after one month of routine use, carrying it in my backpack, and Amazon charges an outrageous price of $200 to get it fixed (I price I refuse to pay). This might be a good device to leave at your bedside, but then, what's the point of being able to take it with you wherever you go?"
1,Amazon can take your stuff anytime they want.,"Because of the DRM inherent in the process of purchasing an e-book from Amazon, they have total control over what you can and cannot do with that book. At any time they choose, they can delete the book from your Kindle. They can restrict the way in which you read that book. They can delete any notes you took regarding that book. Purchase an e-reader that lets you control your own property."
1,Great device---very poor corporate decision-making process,"The Kindle (I hesitate to call it mine since it obviously belongs to Amazon along with all the content on it) is a great device. However, I'm disappointed that Amazon handled the George Orwell book episode quite poorly. Had they explained the situation before taking action, perhaps everyone would have been more understanding. I do think it was a good lesson---while I knew I was only licensing books, I hadn't fully realized what that meant. As of today, I have canceled all my subscriptions, turned off the wireless, and when the Kindle battery dies or the device breaks, I'll not be buying another. I'll still use Amazon for my book and DVD purchases, but no more digital books, at least not until they work out a better solution than deleting material without some kind of notice."
5,I luv my Kindle,Very pleased to carry all of my reading material in one folio. No more stacks of books on the night stand and I can change to a new book any time I want.
5,best gift ever!,"I received the Kindle from my kids for Christmas. I absolutely love it! I have downloaded and read 3 books since Dec. 25 and have only had to charge the battery one time. The ability to download books from just about anywhere is a great feature. Wasn't sure about reading from a ""computer"" but since I bought the Kindle cover as well, now it really feels like a book."
1,Beware! Fragile -- any carelessness will cost you,"I loved my Kindle 2. But when I dropped it a few inches onto the floor, the screen stopped working in one quadrant. It looked like an Etchasketch gone bad. And, I was shocked to learn that it would cost me to replace it. The customer service person was very nice, and indicated that they are delicate devices (it was in a neoprene sheath at the time) but that I was out of luck. She said that if it had damaged itself I could get a replacement at zero cost. I can get a replacement for $200, but I wonder how long that one will last....I've only had this for 3 months! If you are considering a Kindle, think about how you will keep it safe and consider whether it is worth the cost."
1,Won't buy now,Poor poor poor: Amazon pulling e-books from people's Kindle's AFTER they have purchased them! Buy and Kindle and bring big-brother into your home. No thanks.
1,Do you even own the device? 'Cause you sure don't won the books!,"Penultimate. Quintessential. Irony.Those are the words I would use to describe what happened when Amazon decided to yank the digital copies of George Orwell's ""1984"" & ""Animal Farm"" from the Kindles of folks who bought them.If you want to just read a copy of a book, check it out from your public library (plus you can't beat the price!) If you want to *own* the book though, buy the paper book because then no one can legally take it away from you once it is in your possession.Lastly, if you insist on using the Kindle, you have the right to make a backup copy to your PC. EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS!"
4,Kindle reader purchased as gift for my wife,"Product was everything we expected it to be. My wife has been very pleased with it. There are just a few issues I have regarding the product. One, for what you get it is over priced. Bascially your buying a product so you can buy more products from the same vendor. Seems to me there should be an incentive program for avid readers.Last I would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product.Thank you"
5,AWESOME Product.... Thank you AMAZON,I received my new Kindle 2 on Thursday 6/4. This is my first Kindle that I have owned as well as my first ebook. I have already read (2) books on it. The unit is absolutly everything that AMAZON claims it to be. My only suggestion is that you purchase a cover with it. Without the cover seems to be a bit on the delicate side.I purchased the M-edge cover and it fits absolutly perfect. I am waiting for the new e-luminator to be released so that I can complete the set. I currently am using my mighty bright book light that I had purchased a few months back. My only issue would be the price. I do think that 349.00 is a bit steep for the unit but that is a choice each person needs to make on their own. either way I do believe its worth the money just wish it was a bit cheaper say in the 299.00 range or 349.00 and a gift card to download 3-4 books would be great also.
5,Awesome Kindle,Have had my Kindle for over a month now and I absolutely love it. Aside from being a space saver I love being able to adjust the size of the print.
4,Kindle review,"Easy to read text. i guess I'm a traditionalist, I prefer to read in the portrait format. However, tables are best viewed in landscape mode. Unfortunately, in landscape, the text for tables cannot be enlarged. A button for ""Fit Table to Screen"" might prove beneficial. When using the text button to change text size, words per line, text-to-speech or screen rotation, it would be more convenient to be able to choose multiple changes at one time, choose ""Done"" and press the 5-way button and have Kindle do all choices together rather than having to choose each separately, choose the 5-way and then repeat the current process to initiate another change. I haven't experimented with other features at present, but will as time and circumstances allow.Also, I believe it would be a good idea to put the Kindle's User Guide on the Amazon site. I prefer to have this ""instruction manual"" next to me as I experiment with the ""How-To's"".Stephen D'Addio"
1,Good piece of hardware / with restrictive software,"A wonderful device which should have bring us the freedom to carry our books all the time with us, but in fact the books that you think you own can disappear anytime. This is an important danger to our freedom of speech."
1,Do not leave Amazon delete the books you purchased!,"When you buy a Kindle, Amazon controls it, not you. They can enter into your Kindle and delete your books at any time.They recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (I'm not joking, Google ""Amazon 1984"").Amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the ""read aloud"" Text to Speech feature on already purchased titles."
1,Kindle DX,"I was just about to place an order for a Kindle DX when I read David Pogue's article in the NYT. If I buy this product, I want to be able to own, control and have absolute and unalienable rights to retaining all of the books that I would have purchased. Since Amazon appear to control all content that I might have purchased, I have decided that, until Amazon relinquish control of such content, I will never buy either version of the Kindle. I would suggest that everyone do the same."
1,Am I renting or buying?,Books by a certain famous author had mysteriously disappeared from e-book readers. These were books that were bought and paid for.....Welcome to 1984.
4,Amazon Kindle,Love the Kindle-- great for those of us who love to read but don't have space for all the books or no time to go to the library. The Kindle is user-friendly and the books are very reasonably priced. My only complaint is that the Kindle library doesn't have a larger selection.
5,No Worries KINDLE...The IPAD doesn't come close!!!!!,"Okay I just finished watching the dissapointment that is the IPAD!!!! An oversized bully edition of the IPOD; which is fine if you are into all things APPLE... but true book readers will find little or no use for the IPAD. I am a book reader, true book readers will tell you that the worse thing for your eyes, is trying to read a book on a device that has a back-lit screen... And to pay AT&T $29.99 a month for wireless????...I THINK NOT!!! I will rock-on with KINDLE!!!"
3,"Review of the product, and the book store as well","First, for the product hardware itself, I'm very very satisfied, the feeling of like reading a real paperback, the lightweight, the incredible long battery life, wow, what can I say, 5 of 5But just like iPod can not be without iTunes store, Kindle can not be without a good kindle book store. So far, i'm not very satisfied with the content, yes, the new book is very cheap, but on the other hand, I can find so many times that a book I want is not available for Kindle, and they are not out of print books or books 100 years ago, Harry Potter, Scifi by Arthur Clarke and Robert Heinlein, etc, though Asimov's are there, Twilight series is there.I'm not saying it is Amazon's fault, but I'm really disappointed at not being able to get some of my fav on KindleCome on Amazon, bring these books to Kindle, I know it's hard for negotiation, but Kindle definitely can not be the iPod of books if you can not get these things done in the near future."
5,The greatest idea ever!!!,"I absolutely love this device. If you are a reader then you have to buy this. Forget the cost, it is well worth it! It is easy on the eyes, fun to use and the best part of all is being able to buy new books and have it on your kindle in literally a couple of minutes. Treat yourself and buy the cover and the light as well. If you read in bed like I do, then you know that you can get tired of sitting up while reading. With the cover you can fold it open and it will stay upright so you can be on your side & read and not even have to hold the book. I have recommended this to all of my reading friends."
4,I Love It!,"I've been using my Kindle 2 for a day now and I really enjoy it. The display is crisp and easy on the eyes. I can see myself reading a 1000+ page novel on this thing without a problem. The ability to download new content wirelessly is simply amazing.I'd like to see more screen space ala Apple's style. They obviously copied Apple already with the slim profile and brushed metal back. I can't help but wonder why the screen is relatively small compared to the surface area of the unit. Additionally, the keyboard seems to take up precious real estate as well.That being said, the Kindle 2 simply excels where it matters most: reading.I love it!"
5,Great Device,"I got the Sony Reader a soon as it came out and loved it, I could not go back to reading books via paper again(really) as soon as the Kindle became available outside the US, I snapped one up and its far far better than the Sony Reader by miles and I mean miles. The text is 100 times clearer and easier on the eye to read, the buttons are far more comfy to use, I am reading more content with the Kindle than I was with the Sony Reader.The try before you buy is great and has changed the way I buy ebooks now, I dont know how many books I bought for the Reader and they turned out rubbish, with the Kindle I can download a sample and try it out. I can be at work, home anywhere and buy a book and get right there and then great.I got the update that lets me put PDF onto the Kindle so I am happy with that, so now I can put all my books on now, plus you can get free conversion programs that support Kindle format so you have it all now.I love my Kindle and I cant praise it enough..."
5,Kindle,"Everything it's advertised to be. Occasionally have a little trouble with the ""joystick"" button.... hitting it not quite square and getting the wrong operation selected."
4,Kindle 2,"My husband loves this product. He is downloading books like crazy! We had to ship the original Kindle back to Amazon because it had a screen problem - we rec'd the new one in 2 days. We have had to call tech service once with the new one - when he finished reading a book for the day, the Kindle would go back to the first page when he started rereading it. I think this was resolved over the phone. We will probably buy one for me to use. It won't replace actual books, but it is nice to travel with - so much lighter weight to carry around airports, etc. He takes it to work with him in his backpack so that he can easily read during lunch."
4,"Awesome device, but...","I purchased a Kindle for my wife. After a day of her using it, I want one for myself. It is extraordinary at how easy you can access reading material.The one thing blocking that 5 star rating is the screen saver. It cycles through portraits of literary greats (Edger Allen Poe, Jane Austin, etc), and gives no option to change or personalize it. Does anyone else find this presumptuous and pretentious on Amazon's part? I would really like the option to personalize the screen saver on my $400 investment. For example, offer downloadable sets of images or a setting to display the cover the book you're reading. Unfortunately until Amazon offers this, I'll just have to live vicariously through my wife's Kindle adventures."
1,not if you want to own what you buy,"I'm in the market of buying an e-reader. One of the devices I looked at is the amazon kindle. I was shocked to read that amazon built in the capability to delete any content. Not only do they have this capability; they have already used it at least twice to remove books (look for 1984) that customers bought in good faith.Mr Bezos, you apologized to your customers about the way amazon handled one of these removals. You promised to make better decisions going forward. I hope these decisions will include stripping yourself of the ability to delete any content of any kindle. Until that time, I'm not interested in this device."
1,Defective by Design,Amazon's DRM policies are really shady. Deleting content people have already paid for can only be considered theft. Buy real paper books until Amazon frees the books you buy for your Kindle device from any sort of DRM restrictions.
1,Better Hope,"you better hope your Kindle never breaks or it will cost an extra two hundred dollars to fix and you will still be left unsatisfied about the experience. My kindle was featured on the NYTimes, in the paper and the website. It was also on the Huffington Post, and I've convinced at least 6 other people to buy the Kindle because I loved it so much. But, trying to get it fixed has become such a nightmare that I'm almost a kindle hater at this moment."
1,Terrible- READ!,"My wife has a Kindle 1 and liked it so I made the purchase. After waiting 4 months I received the Kindle 2 which has several features that make it inferior. No cover (must be purchased separately), a tiny joystick that is difficult to use, and a design that makes it easy to accidentally push keyboard buttons. After 1 week of use it locked up and was unresponsive. Technical support suggestions to reset it did not work. I will return it for a full refund."
1,very expensive library books,"You don't ""own"" the books you ""buy"" for the Kindle. Amazon can steal them from you at any time, as they just proved when they deleted the copies of George Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984 from the people who had ""bought"" them--Google ""Amazon 1984"" for more information. If you only want to rent books that can be taken from you at any time then buy a Kindle, but if you want to actually own your books stay away from this product."
3,uh Ohh,I was going to buy one until I found the BIG short coming of this device. DRM - an unfortunate and highly invasive entrance to my private rights. I cannot loan or sell any ebooks I buy. All the regular books I have can be loaned to a friend or sold to another as I see fit. This device cancels that right forever! I can only lease a title - period. Until Kindle grants me these rights I see no reason to own one.- Jerome in Huntsville
1,Forget It,"I thought I had found the perfect thing - a way to get books and magazines in Russia where I live and work.On my annual trip to the USA I bought a Kindle, downloaded a couple of books, went to the airport and settled in to do some more reading shopping before flight - and it won't turn on! It lasted all of two days.My flight was canceled, so now I at least have a chance to return this junk since I had an unexpected additional overnight here.Originally I had bought a Sony Reader in London Duty Fee, a great quality unit. I got home to Moscow and discovered there's no reading material available for it. 100 classics - thanks, I did that in College.Bought the Kindle - great reading selection but the unit is poor quality.Looks like an opening here for Panasonic. You guys should stick to retailing and let the experts invent and build electronics.Back to reading the old fashioned way - buying books in airports and hauling books all over the place."
5,Kindle 2,"I am so enjoying my Kindle 2. Receiving books in 60 seconds is wonderful. The voice segment is a little annoying, but I'd only use it when driving, anyway. (Some words are pronounced as nouns when they should be pronounced as verbs, i.e.: present/present). Also, I'll need to consider speeding up the reading, which is possible, and changing the sex of the voice, also possible. The one that comes with the Kindle 2 sounds like the little person in ""Twin Peaks."" It's robotic and spooky. I like being able to archive books I've read to open space for more, and I like being able to do a version of marginal notes in the ""My Clippings"" section. The array of famous authors as ""wallpaper"" is pleasant. My only regret: a few weeks after purchasing the Kindle 2, Amazon began promoting a newer, larger, better kindle. Wonder if they take trade-ins :-)?"
5,Showing off my new Kindle to friends,I love my new Kindle! I take it everywhere with me and show it to all my friends and order more books while they are looking at it to show them how easy it is. I'm also a person who reads in bed and Kindle is perfect for that activity since it is so lightweight and easy to hold. The only down side might be how easy and fast it is to download books and I might get carried away!
4,Love Kindle 2,"Kindle 2 is my first digital reader and I love this product sinceI purchased it. There are some features such as Native pdf and excel arenot supported but Amazon can improve this with software upgrade. Also, if display would be color it would be wonderful. Things to be upgradein kindle 2 would be zoom display and email capabilities. Amazon is coming up with Kindle DX with pdf native format and rotating display could have been better for me."
4,a new book,"This is just like a new book to me. I enjoy the feel of it with the leather cover and the weight with the cover is just right. Without the cover, the unit seems a little to light. The text is easy to read and I like the fact that there are many books on the unit at the same time. I was a little dissapointed that all the books didn't have complete indexing, so navigation was a problem, but that is a seperate issue. I bought mine a few days before the release of the larger unit and wish I had waited. Overall, this is a fine machine and if I can talk my wife into taking this one, well, I will buy the bigger one; its that great!"
5,In love again!,I just love my Kindle!The cost of books is outstanding and elimates the problen of storing printed books.One of the favorited featued of mine is that I can adjust the font sizw. I;m 73 years old and often when I buy a hard copy book on line I never know in advance that I will have difficulty reading it because of the font size.
5,ECSTATIC,"After doing research on electronic readers, I decided the KINDLE was the best on the market. So I started leaving subtle hints to out right begging for a KINDLE for any and every occasion (birthday, Christmas, mothers day, sweetest day, ANY DAY). My family finally broke down and got me one for my birthday. I'm not sure whether they were trying to shut me up or if they really wanted me to have it, but in either case, it is the BEST birthday gift I've ever gotten!! It really does everything it says; best of all it's lightweight, easy to use and certainly eye-catching with the personalized skin and cover. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for an electronic reader. You won't be disappointed."
1,Won't be buying this anytime soon...,"I was planning to buy a Kindle2 this week. However, after Amazon's bone-headed decision to delete e-books that people purchased without their consent, I have decided to pass and purchase a Sony Reader or wait for the CrunchPad. I buy A LOT of books from Amazon, but am now considering switching to Barnes & Nobel....Bad form..."
2,Busted LCD screen - shelf life less than 18 months,"I purchased my Kindle in December 2009 and only use it for long travels of which I've had 4 since then.It is great for when you're travelling as you don't need to take all your books. Sadly, this year in May, I was travelling to Europe and found that my Kindle malfunctioned. Initially I thought that perhaps I hadn't charged it properly but after plugging it in all night, it was still the same the next day - the LCD screen just blew out, I have no explanation, but screen ended up with white horizontal strips across it and grey coloured vertical lines. There is nothing I can do and the whole Kindle is useless now. You can't see anything.So if you get a Kindle be prepared that it isn't going to last that long. For me, even with infrequent use, it lasted 17 months."
3,"Only lasted 1 year, 2 weeks!","I purchased my Kindle 2 a year and 2 weeks ago for my birthday. I have enjoyed it and used it almost daily and loved it until 2 days ago. Actually, I have been frustrated with it for about the last 4 months,it periodically won't go back to the furthest read page when I turn it off. It is a pain if you don't remember the page where you left off. Then, 2 nights ago, I was reading, turned the page and the entire right side of the reader was faded. I tried changing to a new book, turned it off, reset it, same thing. So, I called the 866 number, and they had me try the same things, asked me a few questions, and are sending me a replacement one. I am not pleased that it will be a used one. I Take really good care of my Kindle, have never dropped it, has never gotten wet, and I keep a cover on it, so who knows what happened? I will most likely buy the Kindle 3 because of all the good things I've heard."
1,i like the smell of real books,"Doesn't offer the benefits of a real book. In 20 years, this ""technology"" isn't going to be useful. I just can't believe I bought one thinking it could replace my analog media. I cant even loan out books with this thing. :-/"
2,dont drop it!!!,"I am devastated!kindle costs 359 and they dont even have a repair dept. i dropped my kindle from a counter and it is toast.had it just over a month.they can ""replace it"" for 200 more..."
2,Content costs too much; hardware and content should be separate,"I just read a silly adventure book and thought, Would I have saved anything other than trees if I'd bought the eBook? Turns out I'd have saved $0.18. Eighteen cents? I want to want an ebook reader, but c'mon, the profit margin is so much higher on the electronic version that it galls me to pay the same for it, especially when the increased profit will not go to the author.Now I realize that four weeks of home delivery of the New York Times in paper costs $14.50 and a month of the Kindle version is $13.99. The vast savings on paper, printing, gas, delivery personnel, warehousing, etc., is obviously not being passed onto the consumer.Providing hardware for a reader is one business. Providing content is another. The inextricable link in the Kindle is not a benefit overall for the consumer or the marketplace."
1,DRM-Controlled!!,"I've owned both kindles so far, old and the latest. I have also bought a few e-books for the Kindle...but nothing prepared me for the discovery of the fact that Amazon CAN and HAS deleted books without permission from people's kindles!!! WTF??!! I'm putting mine up for sale now...Even Apple with its myriad of cutting-edge products have not tried (although their full capabilities are yet unknown) to do such a dastard deed as Amazon!!totally disappointed with this news..."
1,BROKEN WHEN RECEIVED.,"I ORDERED MY KINDLE FROM EXPRESSMEDIA AND I LITERALLY JUST RECEIVED MY ""USED-LIKE NEW"" WHITE KINDLE IN THE MAIL, AND AS SOON AS I OPENED IT, I NOTICED IT WAS BROKEN. IT WILL NOT TURN ON, AND THERE ARE A FEW LINES, I KNOW THIS ISNT RIGHT BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT A BRAND NEW KINDLE FROM THE STORE AND I KNOW HOW IT SHOULD LOOK. I KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL KINDLES-I HAVE SEARCHED THIS UP AND FOUND ALOT OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS (IE LINES THROUGH ETC.) THEY SEND IT BACK AND IT GETS FIXED. SO IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD JUST BUY NEW AND DONT GET A USED ONE, CAUSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE. MY KINDLE ON THE OTHER HAND IS GOING RIGHT BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM. I AM AN ACTIVE USER. BE WEARY WHEN ORDERING USED PRODUCTS. I KNOW I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN."
1,No Longer a Fan,I am definitely no longer a Kindle fan! My screen tonight only after a year and a half of owning my device and having never dropped it is now partially blocked out. It is quite unfortunate that such a poorly manufactured product can be sold by Amazon. New buyers beware that once you purchase a Kindle that you may lose access to important books and material. It's sad to say that I'll probably resort back to paper books although I have several other personal electronic devices. Thanks Amazon for helping me NOT believe in technology and good luck trying to compete with the iPad...the Kindle will never match up!
3,Disappointed inTrade-in Value,I purchased my kindle almost 2 years ago...for close to $280 now that I have an Ipod touch I can have the Kindle app and no longer have need for my actual kindle...only the trade-in value at amazon is only $15.25... that is flippin ridiculous!If you are going to purchase a kindle really think about what it will be worth 2 years down the road!
1,DON'T PURCHASE!!! BAD INVESTMENT!,"I purchased a Kindle 2 for myself in 2009. It froze and was unable to be used less than a year later. I contacted Kindle support and they replaced it with a new one, which I was very pleased with. However, again, less than a year later, it froze and died. I contacted Kindle support again, however, the warranty apparently was shorter this time around so I only was left with the offers of purchasing a new one or paying 89.99 for a replacement with a very short warranty of only a few months...and a brand new one is only around $120. They were unwilling to negotiate whatsoever about me receiving 2 defective Kindles in a row.I originally purchased mine for $300. I wasn't even a heavy user of the device and they didn't even last a year, which they must know if they give out shorter warranties. I've invested in a small library of their books and am left with no Kindle. I was pleased with the Kindle before the defects destroyed the product so quickly. I'm very disappointed."
3,Kindle 2,"I love my Kindle, I'm just a little disappointed that they now charge so much to send documents to your Kindle. For the price they should've kept it the same. I have a very hard time trying to send it to my kindle after downloading on my laptop. The memory I feel isn't what it originally claim to be also. I keep getting memory errors and don't have that many books or a large amt of document memory on it. I have also found that some things don't download on daily basis like they should when you have a daily subscription and I lost some of the items,so I canceled my daily items.They should keep it in memory to download automatically since some people can't always turn it on everyday."
3,Ambivalent,"There is a lot to like about the Kindle 2, but it takes some getting used to. It's fine if you're reading right along, but if you want to flip back and check something, or if you want to flip forward and find out how long the chapter is so you know whether to go to bed now, it is a pain in the neck.I like its weight and appearance, and the way it turns pages quickly. I can't figure out what the keyboard is for. If I want to write notes, I don't want to do so with those tiny little keys.But I'll keep trying. Buying books in 60 seconds is kind of neat.Dave Howell"
3,An improvement,"It's better than the first one, but ""Whispernet"" is spotty, sometimes unavailable for days, even in large urban environments with excellent Sprint coverage. I would actually prefer simply plugging a USB cable into a computer and downloading the book to the Kindle; that would be more reliable, lately. The refresh rate on page turns is a little slow, but it's exactly the same as the Sony product which I suspect may even be using the same screen."
4,Suggestion,"The Kindle is a great little reader. But I would recommend a stylus writing capability on it. It would be nice to read a book or a PDF and easily make hand written notes right on the kindle page that can be transfered to my desktop. It would be really nice if it could link to Micorsoft OneNote as well, then taking notes can be fully integrated into my work."
5,Amazing!,I just got mine! It's great the end! Oh but don't get it for anything but pleasure reading!
5,Kindle,Love the ability to download in seconds and have several books available at one time. So convenient not having to stop at a bookstore or order online. Only negative is the darker gray background. I am used to it but need light to see well.
4,Great Product with Mush utility,I love the product and would have given it 5 stars had it been cheaper. I really enjoy the size of the device and readability of the text.
2,Wait for Kindle 3,"I am a K1 owner. I was tempted to switch to k2 until I read the description. I and others will consider a switch seriously when you add back SD cards and owner battery change. Changing the battery myself is a major thing, rather than sending the whole thing back. I have more than 1500 books in my kindle library, and have a 4GB SD card to hold my library. Other than these, it seems nice. Add these 2 things back, and you will have MANY more customers for a new Kindle. I love my Kindle, and Would buy a new one if these things were added back."
2,Too early for Canadians to buy Kindle,"I have purchased Kindle. As a Canadian who reads many Canadian authors, it has been very disappointing with every choice I have made not available in the Kindle store. It would have been better for Amazon to make sure that Canadian publishers were on board before selling Kindle to Canadians."
2,Save your $$,"Save your money and buy an I Pad. I only use it occasionally when I put in my purse and read when I get a moment. The things I think should be added is a back light, art work and more magazine and book offerings. I like to to read in bed and if my husband is asleep I don't want to keep the light on, there is no back lite. This should have been done when it first came out. Disappointed that it does not have this feature. The Magazine selections are REALLY bad and have not used them. Most books I look for are not available either. The new I Pad has much better magazines, book selections and includes art work. Buy that and not a kindle. The I Pad also has a back lite so you can easily read in bed."
4,Love my Kindle,I love the ease and portability of my Kindle. No More bulky hardcover books.The only thing missing is a lighted screen.
5,LOVE IT!,"I simply love my new Kindle. It's so easy to carry in my purse. I can download books instantly and the best feature is the ""read to me"" feature. I can listen to my books while I drive my car. And, it is so user friendly. FANTASTIC!"
5,Love it !!!!!,"I love my Kindle 2. First time I owner of any e-reader device. I love the customer service and quality of products I buy through AMAZON and I have not been disappointed with the Kindle. I have owed it about 30-days and used it daily. I spend about 2 hours a day going to and from work on public transportation. I found my trek to and from work relaxing and productive. I'm exploring the Kindle features on downloading my own documents to it to read work related and school material in my commute. My only complaint is that graphs are a little difficult to read on the screen since I'm unable to enlarge them (at least I haven't figured out how to enlarge those). Overall, I have no regrets in my purchase and would highly recommend it with question."
2,Kindle is too delicate,"I loved my Kindle and took it on a trip with 4 books on it. It got bumped. The screen was ruined. My investment and joy in my Kindle is spoiled, and I won't get another one since it is much too delicate."
1,poor product,"I am very disappointed in the ability to keep a charge. I gave it a full charge Thursday night, read about an hour on Friday and by Saturday it was dead. Has anyone else had this experience?"
5,I'm Sorry and Thank You,"Dear Amazon, I am sorry I broke my Kindle and tried to replace it with an inferior product (i.e., the N**K). It took me less than an hour to learn that the N**K could never replace the Kindle. I immediately returned it and ordered a new Kindle. Thanks for the great product and again, I am sorry I cheated on Amazon/Kindle. The Kindle is THE BEST bookreader. Improvements made between my old Kindle and latest generation are perfect."
4,GOOD - In so many ways . . .,"Have had my Kindle for a month and enjoy it immensely. It's svelte design and easy functionality make it perfect for my needs. Amazon's commitment to improving the software then delivering it invisibly via its wireless connectivity only increase the appreciation for this device. Instead of lugging around many pounds of weight when traveling, I can now take my entire library with me in a few ounces."
1,You don't own content,Amazon can delete your content and you don't own what you buy. Big mistake amazon. I hope your reader fails miserably due to your bad policies!
1,"Great idea, very bad implementation","The Kindle has all what it takes do be a great product but it also has all what it takes do be a product that you don't want to buy. This little device could have been your own portable library, it could have allowed you to carry hundreds of pounds worth of books with you all the time. However, Amazon decided to load the Kindle with digital restriction management (DRM). You never own the books that you put on the Kindle and Amazon can delete them anytime they want, remotely, and without requiring your consent. Not only they can, they already did; they deleted everyone's copy of 1984 by George Orwell. Until Amazon provides a Kindle without DRM, I advise anyone to stay away from the Kindle."
1,KINDLE,"Absolutely amazing piece of equipment. We have failing eyesight and the largest font size works very well. The wireless delivery system for new books etc is astounding. I would suggest that in a future edition, you add one extra larger font size and if necessary, program the screen to run horizontally rather that vertically. You should be able to appeal to a large audience of people with limited vision and make that a part of you advertising. The voice accompanying the printed page is surprisingly good--no noticeable mechanical monotone sound. Great job"
5,Best purchase I've made recently,"My purchase of the Kindle was just so right for me. I love to read and find that paperback books are very hard on my eyes. Using the Kindle allows me to read much longer and has not caused tired eyes. I have read more books in less time than prior to purchasing my Kindle. The wireless connection makes it so easy to buy my next book from anyplace. because when I'm nearly finished with the present book, I have to have the next one ready to start, otherwise I'm not happy."
4,Great/Wait....less than a year and it's not working,"7/29/2010. I love my kindle. It's so convenient.Everyone who enjoys reading should have one.9/20/2010. Review originally placed after I bought myself a Kindle.I had purchased my daughter one 12/14/2009.On 9/21/2010 hers ""froze"". Now, she is a readaholic,and her kindleis well read, but still, I am shocked that she has had this problem with hers.She says the world has ended. :/Hopefully we will be able to return this kindle and receive a replacement.I've read that other people have had problems and that Amazon was good abouttaking care of it. Fingers are crossed. Hope my Kindle holds out for years.Angie"
1,No Thanks,"Books are one of the few remaining media that haven't been abused by their publishing industry to prevent traditional use. I like being able to read a book and sell it, donate it, lend it to a friend, or give it to a friend. Why on earth would I want to have my book essentially crippled by keeping it in a single gadget that I own. Why would I would I want to give Amazon to decide at some future point to take my book away from me? Why would I want to bother to make back up copies that will only work on the particular Kindle that I own at the time? Can't move them to a new Kindle if, god forbid, it breaks or you want to upgrade.No, we don't need DRM on literature, thanks very much. I'm not buying or drinking the Kool Aid.This is a win-win for publishers and Amazon and a big LOSE for consumers and readers."
1,Not with my money....,"Wow! With all the hype regarding this product...and with at least two solid recommendations from family, the Kindle was high on my gadget shopping list. No more....if Amazon can delete MY purchases without my giving permission, then they will not get one dollar from me for their kindle.Refunds do NOT make up for the poor professionalism of Amazon on this issue!"
1,"Nope, changed our minds, we're taking the book back!","I've got a friend with one, it seems ok, but does nothing for me. More to the point, how can you trust Amazon after the whole fiasco of taking back purchased books? Whatever the eventual explanation offered, the way this was handled was awful."
5,I love my Kindle,"I love my Kindle. It's easy to read (easier than a book! No page-turning!), light, and portable. It's an absolute must for traveling, but I use it all the time."
5,The Kindle is My Constant Companion,"Whether on vacation or for everyday reading, the Kindle has become my constant companion. I especially love the Whispernet. I'm always disappointed now when a book is only available in paper or hardcover. I take forever to get around to buying and ordering p-books. Watching for their delivery is a hassle. I love the instant gratification of the Whispernet system where I can have any book that I want almost immediately. And I can change from book to book according to my mood."
5,Great!,I got Kindle for my wife's anniversary and she just loves it. Went on vacation recently and she was reading it all the time! It was all she could do to tke her eyes off it long enough to take in the Rocky Mountains.Gerald Hibbs
5,Bob in LA,"After I heard about the Kindle2 on Charlie Rose, I went on line to see more, was impressed, and had my wife buy it for my birthday.I have only had it for a short time, but like it very much. Easy to hold and ""turn pages"", easy to read, and I can listen when I wish as when driving. Controls are easy and quick.I have downloaded one Audible book and it went well and sounds fine.A way to move about a book more quickly when I have not recorder the number location..such as 10 pages..would be nice."
1,Kindle Without Book Recall,"I will not buy a Kindle until:# When I buy an electronic version of a book that it's purchase is as irrevocable as a paper version of a book. That is, I permanently own a copy.# There is no feature or method for any one other than me, the Kindle owner, to remove a book from my ""Kindle Library"". That is, only I can remove a book from my Kindle Library the same as only me (or a thief) can remove a book from my paper library in my home.nuff said,Reed M B"
2,kindle great amazon price not !,The day after my purchase the price changed from $249 to $189 I am not happy !
1,Don't buy,"I hate to tell this because I love my Kindle, but if you happen to get one with the cord that begins to fall apart, you will be so sorry. I have tried to get Amazon to replace the cord. They sent me the wrong one. I tried by sending the defective one. They sent it back to me with a note telling me to contact Amazon Returns. That is the phone and email people who told me where to send the defective cord in order to get the correct one. I am so frustated. The warning is that if you get a defective cord, forget being able to use the Kindle. The battery goes dead and so are you! This is my first bad experience with Amazon.!"
5,AMAZED,I just got my Kindle a week ago and have already read 2 books. I am an avid reader and have toyed with the idea of this purchase for about a year. I am glad I waited because the price has really dropped but the convenience is well worth the money. The buttons are easy to use and I love the sleek design. Highly recommend to anyone who loves to read. Sunlight is no problem at all.
3,get the DX,"I debated getting this size Kindle versus the DX with the larger screen. I borrowed my brother's DX for awhile and loved it. I didn't want to pay the higher price so ordered this Kindle instead. I am not thrilled with the smaller screen, but like that I can carry it in purse so easily, due to its size. I am hoping to revise this review to sound more positive in the future. I have only had this Kindle for a month."
1,DRM and NSLs,"Kindle is a great device, but its implementation in terms of respect for the end user is deeply flawed.Not only does Amazon reserve the right to rescind your purchases, but they can clearly manage and track the contents of your device.One has to wonder what the threshold is on sharing information about customers and Kindles with authorities. You must demand your right to privacy, however narrowly ascribed in the U.S. Constitution.DRM, or digital rights management, means that you do not control your digital content. If you don't control it, then you don't own it.I am a Kindle owner from the earliest iteration."
2,Missing some things,"I thought that the new one had some good stuff, but they took out one of the most important parts and a bunch of small ones that made the difference to me. The Kindle 2 does not have a slot for an SD card and only has 2 GB of memory. I listen to books as well as read them with my Kindle. I want to be able to carry all of my audio books and not have to swap them out. That was the big deal breaker for me. The small things that may be silly but make a difference are that the back on the new one is smooth metal instead of rubber. It slides all over the place. It takes way to long to turn it off (I don't care what they say, that is not 4 seconds.) The first one is way more comfortable in the hand. I returned my Kindle 2 and went back to the Kindle 1."
3,Downloads & Hardware Upgrades,"Where do you find out how many times you can downloads each book? There are restrictions on the # of downloads possible, which can cause problems if you read books on your Kindle and iPhone - especially if you upgrade your hardware.Some books can only be downloaded once while others can be downloaded multiple times. Where can I find this information for each book?"
1,engineering crap with no customer support,"Avoid the Kindle. Amazon doesn't properly support it [...]. The result is a machine that barely boots up and it is permanently stuck on one page. The FAQs are useless for this. Basically, it is a lesson about buying hardware from a internet company. Don't!"
3,Kindle 2,"The ink on the Kindle 2Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)makes you feel like you're reading a paperback book. The technology is awesome! I can download a book in minutes with WhisperNet, which makes the Kindle better than other e-books brands. The only problem I have is the fragility of the product. I would hesitate to buy it for children. I've had my Kindle 2 for less than a month and already there's a scratch on the screen. Given the cost, I would not have purchased the Kindle if I had known how easily the screen is scratched. There's currently no repair support for the device. I was told it would cost me $200 to replace the screen. I know the technology is new and therefore expensive, but going forward, the device should be sturdier. Ease of use, and mobility are the Kindle's strengths. Fragility and lack of customer support are its weaknesses."
4,Great Product,"I purchased my Kiindle last month just before the price drop. I really liked it, but was even happier once customer customer service credited me the $70 dollar difference from the price drop!The Kindle is good product which does what it is designed to do. I like the built in dictionary and the quick and easy book downloads. The battery life is great. I'm on my second book so far and have only recharged the battery once. It is a pleasure to read, and so far problem free. The basic web functionality is a little tedious, but it's free. I have not yet downloaded any newspapers or magazines but I am happy to have the option available. I have been recommending this product to my friends and family."
5,wonderful product,"I enjoyed mine so much i bought one for my sis as a gift. One reason I bought her one, is the font can be made larger on the Kindle. She is loosing her sight so this is great. It also is set up so the kindle can read to her.. I love that feature too."
4,20th century subway reading,"Being a ""real"" book sensation lover (that is, enjoying texture and smell of books) I was very skeptical about being able to have a positive experience with the Kindle. It took me no time to adjust to the comfort, the portability and the ease of use, not to mention the instantaneous access to thousands of titles and other pubs. I still miss the smell and texture of book pages, but I love being able to read using one hand on a crowded subway holding 3 bags... Battery life is excellent as long as one keeps the wireless off when not needed. One opportunity for improvement would be to add a screen lighting mechanism so that one could read in darker areas...All in all, a great investment."
4,Great gadget......... but,"Bought this for my wife and mum as they share books on my account.Its a great gadget but.... they are struggling to find the authors they like in the Kindle shop in the UK, hopefully things will improve as people take the plunge,so go ahead and order it today!"
5,Kindle,"The kindle is very easy to use even for a non technical person like me.I particularly like that I can travel with many books and take up such small space in my carryon luggage.Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" Display, White, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation"
5,Satisfied New Kindle User!,"Although I am a new user to the Kindle family,(just a month) I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy reading books this new way. No longer having to cart pounds of books with me on vacation or even one book in my handbag is one big avantage. I visited my library regularly every week or two but now find downloading books from the Kindle selection is just great.....no getting into the car.....no longer checking due dates etc. I simply go to my computer and download books. So far I ordered only the Kindle Free books. I was so surprised to see so many of the bestsellers on the Free books list. I'm sure in the future I'll order from their discounted cost list, but now I am enjoying the variety and number of free books.The Kindle is easy to use, and only after using it for a short time, I found myself very comfortable moving from each area, menu to home etc. I hightly recommend this product. Also, Amazon's website is certainly very user friendly."
3,My Kindle 2,"It has been about a month now since I have purchased my Kindle. I most say that I was very impressed with the fast delivery. I ordered it about 6 pm on a Thursday and it was delivered the next day. I love to read and when I am on the road for my job,having the Kindle means I don't have to pack an additional carryon for my books. My only complaints about this product are: 1. It does not came with a color display which would great for the times when shopping for new products at the Kindle Store. 2. I wish this product came with a touchscreen.Overall, I do like my Kindle. I would and do recommed it to anyone loves to read and want to save themselves the back ache of lugging around a backpack full of books when going on vacation. Enjoy ;-)!!!"
2,Make sure you can get AT&T wirelesss before you buy,"I had planned and anticipated FINALLY getting my Kindle. I was disappointed beyond words when I could never get any connection on it. The answer was that AT&T wireless does not work in the area where I live. The customer service rep wasn't thinking clearly when she suggested I not send it back, but rather connect it to my computer with the USB cable...I have a beautiful 17"" flatscreen moniter and have Kindle installed on my computer. Whatever reason would I choose to use an expensive 6"" device other than the free larger display when I would be anchored to my computer anyway? The end is that Verison is right about limited AT&T coverage. I'm sure this is a wonderful product, but don't make my mistake--check to make certain you can get service before you buy."
5,"I love it, but I am angry","I like everything about my Kindle DX, but I am mad that I cannot figure out how to get use the feature that plots my location on a map. I have googled all over the internet for a step-by-step on how to do this, but I still cannot make it happen. I am currently getting 3g service, I try to use the keyboard shortcuts (ALT+1), but they do not seem to work for kindle DX. Somebody help please."
5,love it,"I really love the Kindle 2. It's lightweight and easy to take anywhere. And when you do take it anywhere, it's easy to get almost any book you need instantly.I really love that I can email Word documents to myself. This is easier than reading them on my computer. PDFs have worked pretty well for me also.Screen is good and the battery life works well, since it is based on the number of pages you display rather than time. You can go on vacation and, unless you read a ton, probably do it on a single charge.Worth the money to me. Makes it easy to read and, as I mentioned, much better than using the computer."
1,BEWARE...DO NOT BUY A KINDLE!!!,"I just got the Kindle. I'ts basically a simple computer with a black and white screen and bad keyboard. But aside from the crappy feel of the thing, here is the important stuff you need to know:Soon there will be COMMERCIALS and ADVERTISING between the pages of your books if you buy a Kindle. If you are ok with that, buy a Kindle. But soon there will be POP-UP ADS just like the internet. SO i ask you this, do you think you have the patience to read a book on the internet or on your laptop? Probably not. Do Not buy a Kindle. Buyer Beware."
1,This device is perfect if you have low expectations,The Kindle will only allow you to purchase books from Amazon.Tired of horrible customer service? Did you find a lower price for the same ebook elsewhere? Would you just like to shop somewhere else for an ebook for a change?Too bad! You are stuck with Amazon for all your portable ebook needs. At least until the thing breaks when your warranty has run out.
1,Good Luck! Mine sucks~!,Tried to give this to my husband for his birthday and he/we have had no help -just trouble trying to set it up-ie) change the account/ownership to him; change credit card so he can buy his reading materials BUT NO--nada works and customer service/on-line did not help- so now his disposition is bad and he wants it returned!! so I guess that kind of bad experience says it all!!!
2,You cann't get them all,Before you buy be sure you can down load your books. I have fond some than I cann't.
2,Customer purchase protection,"I purchased the Kindle 1 in December. Amazon should have made me aware of the Kindle 2. It dosen't seem right they would sell me an obsolete product for the same price, knowing the new would be delivered shortly after. There sould be some kind of price protection for long time customers."
4,I like it but....,"I really like my kindle but there are quite a few of the books that I'm looking to purchase that are NOT available in Kindle format. I am currently doing a lot of research into African-American hair care and can't find much of that in the Kindle format. So far only 1 book I was considering was available. And I think I only considered it because it was available. I guess I thought any book could be available in this format. But other than that, I've had no complaints about my new Kindle; it's great!"
4,"Best e-reader, but..",i love1. Long battery life2. Easy to read with its E Ink3. Size and easy to carry4. Text to speech !!would love more if1. Faster processor2. Color ..3. Surf net ??
3,Really great gadget but...,"Bought this for my wife as a gift. She LOVES it. Very compact, easy to use and read. Downloading books is a snap. My only problem ( and this is really more of a problem with digital books in general ) is that when I finish a book, I can't lend it to a friend. Since my wife and I read at the same times we cant even trade off books. I would have to have my own Kindle and buy the same books."
3,Great bit of kit watch out for wireless premium if not in US,"As I have said, great bit of kit, good use of the technology. However,as non US residents we pay $2.50 more for each book than US citizens. This is a premium for the wireless download. Amazon should be upfront about this. I am not sure if Hawaii or Alaska pay a premium for being so far from the Continental US but if they do not then we are subsidizing US kindle users or paying over the odds for books. Amazon may just be seeing away to make a fast buck, but whatever, it leaves a bad taste which is why I am only giving the kindle a 3 stars. The loss of the 2 stars is for Amazons underhand profitering.Go on Amazon print this!!"
3,Kind of disappointed...,"The 5-way controller is way to small, I can't believe that they are selling them this way. That said, once I manage to get to where I want to be (usually involving some four letter words) this device is extremely convenient. Just having the ability to instantly download a book and be able to start reading in an instant was worth the money, not sure about the aggrevation...."
5,AWESOME KINDLE,"I am absolutely thrilled with my Kindle. It's easy to download from Amazon. There are a couple of features I've not used yet, but it's only because I've not made the time to try. Battery life between charges is more than adequate and when charging is needed, it's very easy. I received the leather cover and reading lamp for Christmas and I find them invaluable to keeping the Kindle safe, the screen in particular and make for reading at any time of day or night incredibly easy. This was a great find."
5,Christmas gift from my husband,"I can't even begin to say how much I appreciated this gift as lately I have had to sit in a doctors office for such a long time, and now with my new Kindle it makes the waiting so much easier. I just got started using it, but know I will enjoy many happy hours with this sweet gift."
2,Much over hyped,"It is just another ereader. I have four because of the DRM imposed by most sellers.The lack of external storage is a minus. Amazon has a large selection of books for sale, but if you are looking for more than best sellers and popular fiction, it is likely that you will not find it in kindle format.Other ereaders, like Sony or Jetbook, have much more open format options."
1,Books over priced,Amazon stop squeezing us . E-books are cheaper that hardcover allow us to get a small piece of the savings. I would not buy this unit again. You had me when you first launched the device with a few cheaper books . Now all i can save is on a book is a dollar or two.I will wait for another device. Anyone want to buy a used Kindle?
1,Why would I buy this?,"Why would I buy this when I can buy the Ipad for a couple hundred more dollars and have books among other things included in its features. Also, you can only download books from amazon with this device. Other book reading machines let you download books from anywhere else on the internet. Don't buy the kindle."
3,Stuck with Gross Screensavers !,My wife would like the Kindle 2 a lot more if there was a way to get rid of the freaky gross screensavers of all the old dead authors. Cmon Amazon - upgrade the software. How tough is that? Yes there is an unauthorized patch if you want to download potential virusware into your Kindle but why ?
2,It's not there yet,"Why on earth doesn't it have a standard mini-usb port? Is it seriously to make us buy extra leads??Why on earth doesn't it have wi-fi??The GUI simply isn't there yet, but perhaps we've been spoilt because Amazon doesn't have a visionary fanatic like Steve Jobs at it's helm.The ability to see the wish list would be nice and not-so-difficult for Amazon to achieve.The way newspapers are currently laid out, I really don't think newspaper-reading is going to take-off yet.I'm a UK buyer and I'm also upset that I can't use the browser!Overall disappointed at Amazon's 2nd effort, I'm glad competittors are arriving because hopefully that will spur Amazon to produce a better product."
3,Fantastic Hardware: A Disappointment for Reference Books,"After just a few hours I am contemplating sending this back. Imagine, carrying many reference books with you at all times. A dream.PROS:It is a wonderful device and I am sure it is excellent for serial reading (novels, etc.)The screen contrast is amazing. It really does look like paper. It is small and light.CONS:My big need was for quickly getting around reference documents and it is horrible for that.I suppose this is a review of content more than the device, with little to no linking.There is a search function but not very impressive.It takes so long to find something I am not sure it is worthwhile."
5,Dissappointed,"I am VERY VERY upset that I bought this Kindle for 239.00 and it is now 99.00 less than 3 months after I bought it!!!!! and a better version is available for 100.00 less, just ticked off!"
1,Screen Died,The screen died after 15 months. One year warranty--so pretty convenient for Amazon. Amazon will not fix but requires me to either buy a new Kindle or a refurbished one that only comes with a 90-day warranty. This appears to be a common problem and I have little confidence that it won't happen with the next device.Spend your money on books not a product that dies and leaves you with nothing.
2,"Overall, Sony eReader is a better product","I recently wanted to replace my old Sony eReader so read all kinds of specs and reviews on both the Kindle and the newest eReader. I decided to go with the newest eReader and have not been at all disappointed. While the eReader does not offer wireless download of books as of yet, it does offer other features that I value more. One is the addition of the embedded reading light. I LOVE this feature! No more monkeying around trying to attach a regular book light to my reader. I also really like the touch screen. It comes with a stylus or you may simply use your fingers. I also like that I can download from Google books (I don't believe this is an option with the Kindle).Do your homework and decide which attributes you value most before you make a purchase. Many features are the same on both devices- a crisp clear screen with changeable fonts, etc.I would highly recommend the Sony eReader, especially the newer version."
1,inadequate library,"I have yet to find a book that is available on kinkdle. Very dissapointed. The concept is great, but what is the point if I cannot download any books???"
1,Never received my product,"I cannot give you a review of this product because i ahve never received my item. When I go look up the tracking service that AMAZON provides, it tells my that it is still in transit......"
1,I believe there may have been one kindle available if that,I got the add to cart button and added the kindle instatly to my cart with my high speed wifi connection. Instead of going in my cart I got a wait while processing message that lasted for like 3 minutes. When the time was up it showed a gray waitlist button and no kindle ever went in my cart. Where there really kindles available or was this a scam like the Dell computer from last year?
1,Poor review,Enjoyed using my Kindle while it lasted. Paid $349 for it in March 2009. In May 2010 the screen went blank and could not be saved. Customer Service apologized and offered me a refurbished Kindle for $89. Evidently they have a stock of broken Kindles they re-sell to people. The price has gone down substantially but spending another $189 for a new book or $89 for a refurbished book makes no sense. Farewell Kindle!! Back to the library and loaners from friends for me. Not repeating this experience.
3,Check out book prices - What gives?,"I was ready to order the Kindle 2, when I thought I would check some book prices. Here is one example: Glenn Beck's new book ""The Overton Window"" for the Kindle is $12.99. However, the Hardcover edition sells for $9.95 (on Amazon). Hard to understand. I will do more price-checking before I commit to the Kindle. Any comments will be appreciated, as I really want the Kindle, but now I am dubious."
5,Kindle,"It's been great....amazing how fast it downloads books. The cost per book is a bonus too.Thanks,,,,"
5,Kindle compatible,"Hands free, almost! I wanted a stand for my beloved Kindle. Went to Aaron Brothers Art Mart and the 8"" folding wooden stand was perfect. (6"" was too wobbly.) Other stands didn't fold, so were difficult to carry in my new, Kindle-friendly purse. As a girly-girl, I covered it with stickers to coordinate with Amazon's hot pink cover. I be stylin'. Amazon could offer something similar and it would fly off the shelves--I mean, through cyberspace. (No, I'm not 14 years old. I'm a senior with joi de vivre.)"
4,Kindle 2,I am still a newbie with the Kindle 2. I can say though that I love it!!It does everything I wanted a reader to do. There is tons more to it that I have to figure out. I am totally satisfied with my purchase. I gave 4 stars because I think for the price a nice case should be included to protect it.
4,Excellent Replacement for the delivery boy,"I've used the Kindle 2 for a little over a month and it has been a welcome daily companion. I use it mostly for the paper, but have found the text to speech great help in listening to the paper while at work. On top of which I have yet to really buy a book, since most of the classics I've wanted to read were free downloads. My only complaint is not really a complaint as recognizing this device as a second generation device. I can see the next version being that much better (less lag time, faster response to user input) and can't wait to see this technology mature. Any chance you would be able to share books with other kindle users in the future? maybe just those on a local network? Just a thought."
5,Love My Kindle!,"With my Kindle I have renewed my love for reading. Over the years I have purchased many hardback books, but never seemed to find the time to read them. I got my Kindle for my birthday in August, and have already read two books. Downloading new books is easy and quick. I take it everywhere. I read while waiting for a meal, on the road, on airplanes, etc. My friends say it was invented for me."
5,best thing ever,"I have read so much more with the Kindle than I ever thought possible, the format makes it easy to switch books for what you are interested in at the time, and makes it so easy to come back to the book. Truly a marvel in the technological revolution"
2,"Screen died 2 months after warranty expired, otherwise revolutionary","It was great while it lasted. If you can afford to replace it every 12-18 months, it is a great gadget. Although if you have a tablet that runs e-book reader applications, you may be able to prevent lock-in to Amazon by using that instead of a Kindle."
3,"I wanted to love it, but I don't","I love to read, and have been doing so on mobile devices for 12 years. I have been reading on an iPhone the last couple of years, and have found it great - slick interface, easy controls, touchscreen etc., but small.I decided to bite the bullet and move to the Kindle 2 to get a better reading experience - more screen, e-ink and so on. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The screen felt much smaller than 6"", and I didnt think it was a huge jump up from my iPhone. My biggest beef was that without any backlighting, reading in all but well lit areas requires a booklight. I was also very disappointed with the interface - the controls are very clunky. I guess I'm just spoiled with how slick the iPhone is, and so after less than 24 hours I am returning the Kindle, and considering an iPad.Eoghan Odinsson, Award Winning Author of ""Northern Lore: A Field Guide To The Northern Mind, Body & Spirit"""
1,Waste of money!!!,"I bought the kindle and returned it. I was very unhappy with it. It is hard to maneueve the pages around. It needs a lot of improvements on it. It could be in color, touch screen. It uses the most basic technogoly. Its confusing and hard to get around from one page to another. Too big and bulky. Too fragile because it's so thin, I feel like im going to break it. If it was cheaper I might reconsider but it is way too much money for what it is."
1,"If you want to read, get a book","I had been waiting for years for an e-book so I could get rid of my burdensome library. Amazon's hype made me think the time had come. The one unambiguously positive thing I have to say about the Kindle is the 90-second download. The theoretical benefit of having a paperless library has not materialized for me because I can't read anything on the Kindle. The reading experience is drab and the text-to-voice option is ghastly. The text from the Canterbury Tales I recently purchased comes as one long uninterupted flow : there are no page breaks between the Middle English pages and the Modern English ones and the text therefore toggles without warning between the two every few stanzas. Similarly unpleasant experience reading Shakespeare. Big fan of and spender on Amazon, but can't provide a positive review : I have yet to finish one single book on the Kindle & would gladly sell it. If you like to read, get a book."
5,Awesome,"I love my kindle! I have the iPhone app, which made me want the Kindle itself. Best present I ever got myself!"
1,Warranty (and Kindle) Worthless,"Wow - I went from being a big fan to very unhappy in the space of a morning. My kindle (with cover) was bumped off my nightstand and fell onto the carpet - and the screen shifted. Amazon's answer is that this is a common problem, but that I need to pay a $200 service charge to get a new one as this is not a manufacturing defect.If the Kindle is so brittle that it breaks from a very minor incident like this, it is not worth the money. Nice technology, but I feel really ripped off.Ex-Fan"
5,Love my Kindle!,"I bought a Kindle in preparation for a trip in March from NY to Russia and all I can say is WOW I am hooked! Once I turned Wireless off, my Kindle lasted for 5 days (about 20 hours of reading) before I needed to recharge it. My downloaded books arrived quickly and easily. I like the Kindle much better than Sony's product or the B & N Nook - both of which have more ""flashy"" gadgetry but not much else to offer. Kindle has a better book selection in my opinion and lots of free downloads. Other pluses - the battery life with wireless disabled is fantastic and Kindle provides an actual keyboard, which, for me is better than the ""touch screen"" options out there. Overall, if you are looking for a good, reliable e-reader for travel this is the one to get!"
1,Kindle Killer,"I was a Kindle Lover, recommended it to all my family & friends. I believed in Amazon and their customer first policy until today they announced that they will be raising the ebook prices up to $14.99!! One of the biggest selling points of the Kindle was the affordability of the device and the content. Amazon has given into Apple pressure and has sold out their loyal kindle Fanbase. LET AMAZON KNOW YOU WON""T TAKE IT! KINDLE users, start bombarding Amazon with bad reviews about this policy! Let them know we are not happy!"
1,Was going to get a Kindle but not now....,"I was going to get a Kindle but now that the prices are going over $10 for an electronic book, forget it. I'll just keep going to my half price book store and pay less for a real book."
2,Sent it back!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father. When we tried to register under his name, the screen froze and we were unable to complete. After 45 minutes with Amazon/Kindle people they asked me to pack it up and they sent another one; next day. Seems to be working but boy was this a hassle!"
1,Won't Be Buying This,"Hopefully this new version lasts longer than the original. I spent over three hundred and fifty dollars for the first version. It died three months after the one year warranty was up. Called the Kindle service department and their only suggestion was to push the reset button. Then they suggested I purchase a new one. Sorry, I don't think so. Then I called customer service. They said they were sorry I was unsatisfied but there was nothing they could do. It was painfully obvious they were not the least concerned that a long time customer was unhappy with their expensive product."
1,Disappointment,"I wanted a Kindle badly, but for me, I need to be able to be read in dim light or in the dark. There is no backlight, so this is an utterly useless device to me. If the light is too bright, you can't read the screen either. Amazon needs to work on this to make it user friendly in all types of lighting."
3,KINDLE BATTERY LIFE,"Disappointed by battery life. Reading a longish book (130,000 words) cannot be done without a recharge. I expected more."
3,Kindle Review,I recently bought a Kindle and generally very happy with it. Though I expected it to light up for easier reading. I would not have bought the Kindle because of this missing feature because I read mostly at night.
5,Love My Kindle!!!,"I have had my Kindle for about three months.I love it. It is so light weight, and small enough to throw in my purse, so I always have it with me.I love that I can read it outside in the bright sunlight.If I want to read in bed at night and not disturb my hubby, I just use a little book light. Works great.The battery lasts a long time without recharging, just turn wireless on when you want to use it, don't leave it on at all times.I do not have a single complaint about the Kindle or Amazon."
4,My Kindle,"I live in Canada and could not wait until Amazon started shipping Kindle to Canada. On December 25, 2010 I received my Kindle and was so excited. Immediately I started downloading books I have been adding to my wishlist weeeks before. For someone who loves to read, or rather is addicted to reading the Kindle is really convenient.I didn't give it a 5 because Amazon could have done more with this e-book.These are the issues I have with the Kindle 2:1. It does not display images ( hence no point in subscribing to Magazines)2. In Canada I am unable to upload my PDF files - can't understand why since books are sent to my Kindle in Canada3. Navigation on some books is really hard to do, especially books with a large table of ContentI still love my Kindle"
1,Way too fragile,"I have owned 7 kindles, only one was an upgrade, the rest were replacements (some purchased, some provided by Amaszon). I use a cover and am not particularly hard on them. They are just too fragile. After the last incidents (the screen froze on mine and my son broke his screen by putting very little pressure on it while it was in its case) I will not be using the Kindle again. I have been a loyal user since August 2008 and appreciate all of the features and the ease of reading, but will not continue to negotiate with Amazon on whether the latest problem warrents a replacement or whether I have to buy a new one. I have spent over $1,000 on Kindles and currently don't have one."
4,improvements needed,"I really like the Kindle. I am a voracious reader. I've been using the library and they keep up with new books. Since I read so much, it is getting kind of expensive to use the Kindle. I think I may have to use it only for travel. Also, I would love a longer battery. I am seldom near electricle outlets when I read and the Kindle battery is not lasting as long as I need. I purchased the Kindle at online Amazon."
5,It's alive.,"A fantastic implementation! I get it now. The Kindle is stereo, paper is mono.The screen is clear and a vast improvement over a good LCD PC screen, about like a newspaper.Downloading content was fast and easy (almost too easy).The Kindle is a synergetic mix of technology and features - a living book, something new."
1,Imagine if my Kindle actually worked,"Got my first try at a Kindle yesterday. Opened it up, followed the instructions, in about 3 seconds the entire process froze and hasn't moved. I went to the reader boards and discovered 88 other messages from people whose Kindles had frozen and decided if I've got to spend a couple of days back and forth on the phone getting the thing to work, then I'll wait out Amazon figuring out how to sell something that actually works and try again then. I don't seem to have this problem with Apple or Dell. It's back in the return box tomorrow."
1,Be Careful What You Purchase,"My only real issue is that once you purchase something you can NEVER get rid of it. I called Amazon support today to have two books removed that were purchased by my roommate on my Kindle and they told me I could not have them removed. I did not want my money back, I did not want credit... the only thing I asked is that they be removed from my account and I was told ""we can not do that"". If I purchase something, I should be able to throw it away."
1,The Kindle---an object lesson in DRM (Digital Restrictions Management),"Unfortunately, books you ``buy'' for the Kindle are not yours. They can be taken away from you at any time. Witness Amazon's ``disappearing'' of (ahem!) _1984_ and _Animal Farm_ last week. (Just Google for ``amazon 1984''.)It turns out those books were removed because they are still copyrighted in the U.S. (Though not in Canada, among other countries.)This changes the situation not in the least. It matters not _why_ the books were removed. All that counts is that they _were_ removed. Amazon can do this with any book, at any time, for any reason. Ask Amazon for a refund. (For an example of a true horror story, look at the first one-star review.)Don't kid yourself---you don't buy books for Kindle, you rent them for an indeterminate length of time. Buying a Kindle means you're putting yourself at the mercy of Amazon---not my idea of a good thing."
5,very enjoyable,Since recieving my kindle 2 I have done a lot more reading. I find it to be very comfortable while holding it and it's a pleasure not to have to hold pages open. The adjustable font size is great too. It makes it easier to read with larger text than reading a paperback. I was a little scepticle when I ordered it but I'm very glad I did. It has alot to offer and the downloading is very fast. I would recommendthis product to anyone who is interested. keep up the good work. Excellant product.
5,The NEW way to Read!,"I received my kindle exactly when the shipping date said. I have purchased a few books since then and I am truly enjoying my kindle. I have updated the software version, with the assistance of the Kindle support representatives, otherwise I use it several times a week and I look forward to using it for educational purposes in the future."
5,kindle,"Love my Kindle. It is slim, slick and fits very well in my purse. It is the perfect size to travel with and cuddle in a good chair. I can read anytime, anywhere. Even better, I can get new books within seconds! I don't have to go to the store or order online and wait 2-10 days for my books.Super cool!"
4,Kindle 2,"Me ha gustado el kindle 2. Eso si. Echo en falta una ranura de memoria, mejor visionado de los pdf, y no me ha gustado nada que no me hubieran avisado que saldría proximamente una actualización.Por lo demás, contento."
3,Finally international... BUT,"I was really exited that finally, we can get the Kindle over here in Germany.When it came today, I found it pretty much as described by everybody else, with the tiny little exception that- Web Browser is not supported- Wireless transfer is charged at 0,99/MB(""Service fees for transferring personal documents via Whispernet are currently $.99 per megabyte"")which takes awy most of the fun of the entire idea!Admittedly, both appears on the ""information for your country"" subpage (and while I tend to say that was NOT there when I placed the order, that's of course nothing I can prove).Anyway, I think I'll play around with it a little longer, but there's a good chance I'll return the thing.Too bad :-/"
4,Kindle 2 Review,"It looks very good and is pretty easy to use. I wish there were more books for it though, but I'm sure that more will show up in time. It's very light and thin, which makes it really easy to take it anywhere. The battery lasts forever. I would've given this product a 5-star rating if it had more books."
4,Kindle 2.0 is great,"I bought my first Kindle about 2 months ago. Love it! The built-in dictionary is really handy - I'm sorry to admit I'm too lazy to get up and walk over to a dictionary, but if it's in my hands, I'll use it. I love the ability to buy a book w/ one-click. (I bet Amazon does too.) I wishthat it could handle .PDF files natively - if it did that, I'd give it 5 stars."
4,Kindle2,"It has been a great gift....for the voracious reader in my house, my husband. Reading every article I could find on the device and then having the opportunity to use one, a generous traveler let me try his during a flight, I knew it would be a perfect gift. My two concerns were the loss of ""turning pages"" and its size for reading newspapers (given their format). The absence of the physical book has turned out to be a non-event; the sizing for newspapers turned out to be the manufacturer's concern as well, a larger version was launched after my purchase. I gave the device 4 stars due to the sizing concerns. My husband isn't very high tech and I worried about making this purchase. He asked that I print out the User Guide and he got himself up and running with his Kindle2. We also purchased a protective sleeve and a car charger."
5,Kindle Lover,"For someone who reads every chance they get, this is the perfect device. I carry it with me everywhere. Great when waiting for service, husbands, or anyone."
4,Mostly love the new Kindle,"It is so convenient being able to download a book when you want it. And I've saved a ton of money as my wife can wait till after she reads chapter one to buy the book. No more unread books on the shelf.It would be great if there was a built in backlight at times.Also would be better if there was no click sound when turning pages - for quiet offices, etc.A setting to auto-shutoff wireless after so many minutes of non-use would be nice too.I love being able to change the font size, and also be able to receive a document that I can read full-size via email if needed."
5,Comparison shopping,"I decided to purchase my Kindle after several months of reading reviews by as many web sites that I could find. I compared everything between the Nook and Kindle. Most people recommended Kindle. So, I finally bought it in April and I couldn't be more pleased. I love it. My only issue is that where I live, getting service to download books can take a while, but it is doable."
2,Broken WIthin a Couple of Weeks,"I didn't realize when I bought mine how fragile Kindles are. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it since my idea of pleasurable reading does not include clinging tightly to a device worrying about the possibility of dropping it. I put the Kindle on a chair in a doctor's office, and it slid out of its case and onto the floor. That fall rendered it unusable (or at least I would not want to have to miss the top few lines of every page when reading a book). Finding out that repair costs are huge, I decided to recycle it. I sent e-mail to Amazon's Customer Service to get the information about where to send it for recycling (why that information isn't on the web page I don't know) but never got a reply. I then found that a friend in Texas wanted to take it and play with it, so I mailed it to him. I enjoyed using the Kindle the very short time I was able to."
4,Excellent Device,I have owned my Kindle for about a month now and I think the device is great. There are a few things on my wish list for the Kindle (By the way I have the 6 inch). I happen to live in an area where connecting to the wireless Wispernet has been challenging and I wish the selection of reading materials were more extensive.I travel quite a bit and the Kindle has made my travel experiences so much better. I usually carry 5 - 10 books with me on trip this has now been reduced to this thin little device. I enjoy reading and this device makes it much easier to enjoy one of my favorite escapes.
1,Orwellian distopia,"Don't throw your money away ""buying"" books that Amazon may or may not decide to take back later. Amazon's loyalties are (judging by their actions) with the publishing companies rather than with the consumers that pay for their (overpriced) products. DRM = defective by design. As backwards as it sounds, the paying customer is the enemy."
3,disappointed,"I love my original kindle and debated about upgrading to the newer version but went for it. I am finding though that the battery life is horrible. There is no definite on/ off button like the original just a slide to put it to sleep. What I am finding is if I dont use my kindle for a few days and then pick it up I have no battery power even though I shut it off the only way possible. I am frustrated with this situation...why no real shut off and why such poor battery life? Thought the second version would be an improvement , the original now seems like the better of the two. Still enjoy the convienience but a frustrated with this scenario."
2,Kindle - Ireland,"I recently obtained my Kindle Global Wireless Reader. Delivery was received promptly. It is well made and is pleasing to the eye. While I understood from the begining that pictures would not be available outside the US on newspapers to which I subscribed, I failed to appreciate how much the absence of a few images takes from the newspaper reading experience. I must also say that the number of current / desirable books available in the kindle store is less than impressive. It is also a disappointment not to be able to use the web browsing feature. All in all - my Kindle may well end up on an ebay site before christmas."
3,convenient,The convenience of having my reading materials where I go is the big plus. I do not find the navigating around easy enough. I have not figured out how to find a book that I want to read that is not suggested on the screen...is it that the books are limited to these or is it that i am not searching correctly. That is the down side for my use of the otherwise convenient reader.
4,refund,This product seems to be alwright. I bought it for a gift but the recipiant wasn't happy with it and I returned it for a refund and am still waiting for that refund.
2,Wait for iPAD... Kindle will be a History !! I think it is already ..,Wait till you read / hear more about iPad. Hold on to your purchase.
4,My new booklovers tool - the Kindle.,"I am just getting familiar with my Kindle - but I think it is going to be a very positive relationship. It will take a little time for me to really navigate it efficiently - but you know ""you can teach old dogs new tricks."" I am excited to learn a little more about it each week.Marilyn Frederick"
5,Kindle 2,The Kindle 2 is lightweight and easy to read. With the leather cover that comes seperately the device feels very much like an ordinary book.The only drawback that I see is that it does not have an adjustment for more light on the reading surface if needed.
1,THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED MORE TRASH!!!!!!!,"Far less than one star!! I'm offended that there is another electronic item on the market that is made by underpaid workers out of materials that do not break down easily that will soon be thrown away!!!! I really wish that the inventors, manufacturers and consumers of this product and others would think and care about their world in as deeper way. This invention makes me deeply sick!!!"
1,Nice looking but an Expensive one trick pony,"The new Kindle 2 is a nice looking device compared with the original. But it is still a one trick pony---basically a very expensive e-book reader. It has several negatives:Expensive to buy.Basically an e-book reader, other uses like wireless browsing either cost extra (wireless fees--see wireless agreement) or aren't offered.No back-lite for dark low light settings.DRM on purchased e-books.Relatively expensive costs for e-book content ($9.99 & up)For my money, buy an iPhone, Blackberry, etc & get the whole nine yards of connectivity, then download Stanza or other free e-book readers. This will allow you to get tons of free classics from Gutenberg project & you can add recent audio books to your computer & sync them with your device. Recent Audio books on CD can be gotten cheaply from flea markets/yard sales & free from the Public library."
2,"Times are tough, lower the price already","Seems like the price of everything electronic drops over time but not this baby.$[...] is pretty steep for a glorified IPOD. If the content was free or [...] cents a book I could maybe see it, but your paying $[...] or more per download.If this thing was $[...] bucks they would be flying out of the warehouse, don't understand the marketing strategy here at all."
1,Huh,"I don't have a Kindle and don't ever plan on buying one, because, well, books (REAL ONES) are my thing.I thought I might get one for my hubs one day, but now that I've seen all these one star reviews, I don't think I will."
4,Kindle is the cats meow,"The small Kindle 2nd gen isan indispensable companion. In those interminable waiting situations endemic to modern life it makes the irritation melt away. However i have one peeve. That is the size of the wake up switch. It is way too small, requires a finger nail for a positive action.I, almost every cycle, miss it and have to go back and recycle it because my finger slips off before it completes its cycle. I think it would be an easy redesign and I think you should consider it:O)"
2,Fragile Screen???,"First, everything about the Kindle is quite true. Its readability and convenience is outstanding. I have read several books if the last few weeks because of its features. I was an avid reader but increasing age has made printed books more of a challenge, but the Kindle with its varying font size and very light weight has made reading fun again.However I am currently on a road trip. The Kindle was in a leather case and inside a padded pocket of my Apple laptop case. On the third evening the Kindle was totally non responsive, just strange lines on the screen. Amazon support says the symptoms indicate screen impact damage which is not covered by warranty. The case was not dropped nor was anything stacked on it.The dramatic video of the Kindle being dropped 30 inches is now somewhat suspicious.Amazon will replace for $200 and return of the failed unit, but I am now very concerned about its apparent fragility and Amazon's failure of responsibility for an expensive device."
5,Fantastic device,"I was apprehensive about getting the Kindle. Luckily, my wife got me one for my birthday. So far it has been fantastic.The e-ink technology is much easier on the eyes as opposed to paperback with small print, since my vision is not what it used to be. It is also nice to have the ability to make the font size bigger.I've also been reading a lot more, especially with the Kindle for PC software. I can eat lunch at my desk and continue to read my book without having my Kindle with me.The only bad things I can think of is, the screen could be a little bigger. The plastic frame around the display takes up a whole lot of room. The other would be a fully functional web browser with color, but I know that this device was not intended to be a computer/ipad, but it would have been nice."
5,A very satisfied customer,"I am an avid reader both for pleasure and for business... but as I get older I have problems reading books unless they are written with enlarged text.A trusted friend of mine who also loves to read and is experiencing the same eye problems told me about this product. Since purchasing my Kindle in April I've read over 10 books without any sight difficulty and I've saved a significant amount of money on the purchase price of the books.I can shop for books,have immediate delivery via wireless download and pay discounted prices,all from the comfort of my home. Kindle rocks!"
2,No folder support! Unacceptable!,"I just received my Kindle 2 and while I think there is much to like about it, the fact that it does not allow the user to create folders and manage their own content is a HUGE, HUGE drawback in my opinion. You can't separate your fiction from your non-fiction. You can't separate your history from your philosophy. What good is having 1500 MB of space when you can't organize your content the way you want to? Leaving out such an obvious feature is so STUPID it is mind-boggling. Get a bunch of books and you just end up with clutter, since you can't organize except according to Author, Title, or Recently Read. Who wants to thumb through page after page to find the book they want?The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability."
5,Love it!,"I enjoy being able to travel with my Kindle, have all my favorite books to enjoy and not having to worry about losing valuable space. The kindle is a perfect e-reader for people on the go. I enjoy knowing that I only have to charge the battery every 10 days or so."
3,It's cheaper to go to the library.,"I'm all for being ecologically friendly and practical regarding space, but I find the kindle incompatible with my lifestyle--considering the price of books and magazines is in the 2.99-9.99 range. No thank you, I'd rather check a book out from the library."
1,Books are too expensive,"I do not own a kindle. I have no TV and I read 200+ books every year. I love gadgets. Why don't I own a kindle? Because the books are too expensive. These books do not need print production, printing presses, binderies or (most expensively) distribution. Why do they cost more than most paperbacks? Take a lesson from iTunes and make the books less expensive."
1,"SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON","Let me be clear - the device itself is very well designed, as evidenced by many of the reviews. I must, however, register my caveat somehow - be sure to notice that they dropped the price of this item $100 since February. Heckuva way to reward early adopters."
1,Disappointed in the price,"I have been waiting with some eagerness for the release of the Kindle 2 but am sorely disappointed in the price point, which has not been reduced since the original version was unveiled. This must be a first for any tech product, and it is very annoying. Given the state of the economy and the fact that this product is far from being a necessity, I will happily keep my dollars in my pocket until Amazon comes down to reality."
1,about the kindle,i want to ask you something i want to buy the kindle but i only want it to read books that's it . i don't do newspapers and blogs .i just want to read my books so before i buy it please i need to heard from somebody.W/B/STHANKS:annie
2,Packaging,"I was very surprised by the packaging that the new Kindle comes in. It's made of egg carton material and once it's opened, there's no reusing it. I'm giving it as a gift and wanted to charge it beforehand and found that now that it's open, it keeps slipping out of the package. I'm worried about transporting it in the Birth day bag just to get it to it's final destination.This product is way too expensive for the cheap material and impractical packaging design."
5,My new Amazon Kindle,"I'm not sure how I ever managed without my Kindle. I used to buy two of every hardcover book because I didn't want to lug them from house to house when we went to our vacation home in the desert.Now I just slip my Kindle into my briefcase and have everything I want to read at my fingertips. When they get a color version I'll be happier, but for now, I wouldn't be without it.I've almost paid for it in the cost of books and only had it for a month or so."
4,grrrrrrreat,I have used it not stop since I bought it. I am waiting for more of my favorite authors books to be digitized. It is easy to use and the length of battery life is up to you depending on if you are just reading or surfing. I was on vacation for 17 days and I charged it 3 times. It's not perfect but it's close. We plan on getting a second one for my husband so he can read the great books I have bought.
3,Learning to love my Kindle,"I have gradually gotten to love my Kindle in spite of the fact that I thought it was overpriced. I love the fact that I can order a book and it is there, immediately, on this device that fits in my purse. If I am reading a couple of different things at once I can skip from one to the other and Kindle keeps my page. This is a wonderful thing for an impatient person because I am never bored when I have to wait somewhere. I like the fact that you click to turn a page, rather than having to scroll. I love being able to adjust the font size easily. My complaints are: I would like a backlight that could be switched on and off rather than having to clip on a book light. I can't follow links in the blogs I like the way I can from my laptop. Photos and graphs don't come through well - but I think the new Kindle DX solves this problem, although it is a larger, less portable size. I would love to have a Kindle in color!"
4,read to me - poor,"I love my Kindle with the exception of the quality of the read to me feature. It is basic computer speak, nothing to the level of the audiobooks. I was looking forward to this feature and was disappointed in the quality.Also a lighted screen would be a great addition, it gets bulky if you have to add a light."
2,Mitigé,Lire un PDF sur ce Kindle à l'extérieur lorsqu'il fait grand soleil n'est absolument pas un problème (on a vraiment l'impression de lire un livre papier!!). La longévité de la batterie est également excellente (peut facilement tenir 20 à 30 jours sans recharge).Par contre... quatre points sont détestables selon moi:1. La navigation d'un PDF à une autre ou d'une page à une autre2. Le gestion catastrophique de signets3. Le fait que les commentaires ne sont pas intégrés directement dans les PDF et en plus perdus à l'export4. Les images de l'écran de veille qui sont imposés et peuvent vous faire passer pour un imbécileEspérons que la 4ème ou 5ème génération corrigera ces défauts.
5,I <3 my kindle,Best Present in the world. I love being able to read books instantly and every where. The kindle is so easy to use and so mobile. If you are a serious reader this is for you. The Amazon/ Kindle customer service is amazing as well. I have had a few issue and had to exchange my Kindle a few times; first the charger stopped working and the second time there was a weird gray line on the screen (which may have been my fault) but each time when I called to see about getting it replaced the person was always so nice. The best customer service reps I have ever talked to. The replaced my Kindle right away each time and the process was so easy. Amazon really did a great job on this one.
2,Power Switch,"I bought a kindle for my wife in june 2010 and since she has had it she has a problem with the on/off switch, it is hard to turn off and it wont stay off, she has talked to 3 different people at amazon and basically has received 3 different answer to the basic question..This is pretty poor customer service coming from amazon"
5,Great gift!,"My 74 year old mother asked for a Kindle for her birthday this year. She absolutely loves it. Now, I want one!!!"
5,great but a bit heavy,"love the kindle, but while reading at night a bit heavy in the hand. fantastic to be able to buy wirelessly - and very smart you guys, the amount I spend on books is rising as we speak. would love it if books were published in hard back and kindle form at the same time. at least i would like to be able to pre-order the kindle version of a book, so that i do not have to keep checking for it to come out."
5,I LOVE my KINDLE,I don't think there's anything greater than a Kindle right now. I've had mine since Feb. and I take it everywhere with me... trips and everywhere else. The only problem i have with the Kindle is trying to get it away from my husband so i can read it too. Di
1,Not much use as not a good library selection,"I purchased the Kindle with great excitement as i love a good read. Great machine but it fails dismally on it's library selection. yes i should have searched more before buying it but really thought they would have Lee Child, Baldacci, Vince Flynn, Sue Grafton etc. Some they have but only the odd book and some no trace at all. As result i returned the Kindle suffering a financial loss of 40 postage costs to & from USA. When i selected a sample Patricia Cornwell to download i ended up woth a historical novel excerpt so that failed too."
1,just get an ipod touch,"for almost the same price you can purchase an i-touch and load the kindle app for free. just set up a 1-click account in amazon with your credit card and you will get your books via wireless. It's one less bulky thing to carry.. not to mention the accessories and the chargers.No Kindle Required - The Complete ""Kindle for iPhone"" User's Guide/Unlock the ""Lightning Web Navigator for iPhone & iPod Touch"" (DRM-Free with Text-to-Speech Enabled, User-Friendly)"
3,"My wife likes it, clumsy navigation, lost all the books","We skipped Kindle 1 -- too primitive. My wife loves Kindle 2 for sequentially reading a book. The manual is rather cryptic, so we don't use the bells and whistles. I find it annoying that pages are small and we can't scroll down.Last night I downloaded several FreeKindle books (nothing bootleg, an Amazon company), adding to the group added previously. This morning I looked for something and accidentally wiped out everything, both free and purchased. I have no idea how, but over 200 books are suddenly gone! This is absurd! It is safer to read the books on a laptop computer, where you can scroll and probably won't lose more than one or two at a time, and Amazon can't suddenly decide to delete a book either."
1,customer service problems.,"I ordered my first Kindle this morning. About an hour later, I received order confirmations for TWO Kindles. I called their customer care center immediately to cancel one of them and was told that it was too late, that I only had a half hour window to do this and that the products were being prepared for shipping. They had not been shipped at that point. When I asked what I could do they told me ""Nothing."", that when the two Kindles arrived I could refuse shipment on one of them and after it was sent back they would issue a credit for my credit card. Not too good. I am considering sending both of them back and disputing payment on my credit card. If the ordering experience is this bad, I don't have high hopes for the Kindle itself."
1,How many times do you want to repurchase the SAME kindle book?,""" there's no way to find out in advance how many times a book is able to be downloaded. You can buy a book and it can only be downloaded numerous times or you can buy a book and only then discover that it can be downloaded only once. (The rep even put it this way!) There is no way to know.""[...]"
3,"Not Bad, But....","1.The function of Mp3 can be played orderly, cannot be played randomly.2.The CPU does not work fast enough.3.The capacity of the storage is too small.4.If you had more than 1000 documents in Kindle, then you would have to spend much time to find a document you want if you do not know the file name. That means you have to find it out page by page.5.As a user of different language, it is auwful that the OS supports English only.6.It is really good that the Kindle2 can read to me!7.Is it true that the Amazon is going to produce the next generation of Kindle with a larger display?"
3,Sorry to be a European,"The Kindle is all I expected it to be and it will help me to avoid avalanches of books I cannot stow anymore and I don't have the heart to get rid of.However I regret that the build-in browser does not work in Europe and that quite a few e-books are only available in America. Also the books that are available cost more in Europe than in America.I do understand the reason for this, but it would be nice to have been made aware of it before buying. Since Amazon does not mention it anywhere, I do feel a wee bit cheated.Peter Teigeler, Spain"
5,LOVE IT!,"I've had my Kindle 2 for about a month now and I love it! It's great for reading in the car or on the couch. The navigation buttons are easy to use. I like how it makes use of Whispernet so I can go online at anytime, other Readers didn't have this option or cost more than I was willing to spend. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It fits perfectly in my purse or computer bag and doesn't take up much space or weight."
5,Kindle2,"I enjoy my new reading ""technology"", and look forward to more selections being available for the Kindle2. Reading the newspaper on the Kindle2 is a little difficult, as it is hard to ""scan"" through the available headlines. I was disappointed that the comics are not available, but the local news coverage was a plus. I LOVE being able to see a book on TV, and within minutes I can purchase it and have it downloaded to the Kindle2. I also love the discounted price for a Kindle2 book, and the environmental savings also."
5,Very Pleased,I jsut recently was given a Kindle for my birthday and I haven't stopped telling people about it. I use mine basically just for pleasure reading so far. I have found that I actually read more books with this device becasue they are right at my finger tips. The kindle makes it so easy to research the books they have to offer. The ease of downloading the books is amazing. It is really cool to download a book while sitting by the pool or in traffic. If you are a bit worried about reading on an electronic device and not paper don't be. I have to say I was a bit worried about that too. I am looking at a computer all day at work and didn't know if I woudl like reading on the Kindle but it is nothing like a computer screen. The whole device just goes away and you are just focusing on the words. I jsut can't say how happy i am with this product. It is very easy to use and jsut a great companion. I would reccomend getting some sort of case for it though jsut for protection.
5,A little hard to master,"I hate to read directions on how to operate any new device. So, I just started using the Kindle by trial and error. After about a half hour, I was able to download and begin to read a novel.There is much more to a Kindle than that. I finally talked to a lady who had owned one of the first Kindles. She showed me how to do various things and now I am beginning to feel more confident in its operation.Anyway, I have enjoyed the Kindle a great deal and would recommend it to anyone.The screen on the I Phone is to small to comfortably read a whole novel. It is fine for messages, but won't do for long time use.Richard Whittle"
4,in the beginning was the word,"I purchased the Kindle for my wife.She reads in bed until sparrow fart whist I slumber. Age does that.She loves it. The thing looks good and works well, the screen is clear and the operating protocols are simple and effective.So much so that I have taken to er 'borrowing' the thing.Being a designer addicted to pen and paper and working in the murky fringes of the publishing world I felt a traitor to Caxton, let alone the whole industry that has provided such good lunches, but no more.Books will always be with us, but on a train, a plane, a corner of life - the Kindle will flourish.My only regret is that the published works are somewhat limited and slewed towards an American readership.I know from my own experience that some authors are very wary of the whole electronic publishing scene. This will change I'm sure.I would recommend this bit of kit. It is well worth the money."
3,Works as advertised.,"Size, battery life, download speed and quality are all great. The display is okay. I read a lot of finance books which have charts and graphs that don't show up well on the screen. Also the page transition is annoying and not conducive to quick and smooth reading. I actually prefer reading on my Blackberry because of the touch screen scrolling. Never been an Apple fan but think the iPad and the Kindle app will make me a convert soon..."
2,Strains the eyes,"Brief review, as most others have gone in length before me: Love having a Kindle, absolutely hate the dim, low-contrast screen. My eyesight isn't horrible, but this grey screen is giving me a lot of problems. I can't read for any length of time without my eyes hurting. I downloaded a bold font hack that makes it a little better, and I'm going order a dark skin to see if that helps. Also a negative: the screen DOES reflects sunlight and lamplight; need to get an antiglare screen. From what I've read, the screen isn't an uncommon problem.So lots of pros to having a Kindle. But the actual utility of my Kindle is hard for me because of the screen."
1,Kindle 2 can not be used to read PDF files.,"Kindle 2 is a good device for reading books you buy fro Amazon in Kindle format.If your goal in buying a Kindle 2 is to store PDF formatted documents to read while on the road you better plan on bringing a dissecting microscope with you. The font size of the PDF files that you down load into Kindle 2 is about 2. You need 20x magnification to read them.The statement that Kindle 2 can read PDF file reminds me of the ad where a little girl is sitting on a bicycle inside a small marked area. When she complains that you can't ride a bike in this little area, the man who offered her the ride tells her you can't ride well in this area. A factually true statement, but rather a dishonest one.I think Amazon's statement is very misleading."
4,book lover,"As an avid book reader, I was eagerly anticipating my new Kindle, especially for travel. So far, I have only used it for traveling, but I do like it a lot. The features I especially like are the ability to increase the print size, the readily available dictionary, the portability and the light weight of the product, and the easy accessibility to hundreds of books, in an instant. I expect that I will over time use my new Kindle for much more of my reading including newspapers, magazines and new book releases. Thanks, Amazon, for a good product!"
3,Failed within a month,The unit failed within a month. Call Customer service and received a replacement the next day at no cost.The ordered books were installed on the the replacement. Very impressive.
5,Game-changing,"I love my Kindle! In business school I learned the phrase ""poison pills"" -- products that solve pre-existing problems. The bigger the problem, the more necessary the ""pill."" I travel and read alot. Before the Kindle I would lug at least 2 magazines and a couple of books every time I left home. It was inconvenient, heavy and expensive. The Kindle solves that problem. It is remarkably easy to read; it's easy to download books and magazines (and feels like good value even if the cost of the Kindle is steep); and you will read more. I can't recommend this ""pill"" enough."
5,Regret not buying sooner,"Why did I waste time waiting to read the reviews on the Barnes and Noble's Nook? The Kindle has met all my requirements, most important is the instant downloading of a book. No need for a computer or WiFi area. I am totally pleased with its size, weight, and handling. Amazing is the no glare when reading in bright sunlight. This is a hands down winner! I did buy a cover that bends back; for those who like the feeling of holding a book this is a plus."
1,NOT HAPPY with Amazon customer service,I bought this as a gift for a friend on her marriage after hearing good reviews from people who own it. At first she was delighted with it since she is an avid reader and a frequent traveler. But that was only till she tried switching it on. It turned out that the device was defective (screen display issues). My friend got it replaced and the replacement kindle was AGAIN DEFECTIVE with the exact same issue. Each time she had to spend many hours talking to Amazon representative's to nail down the problem. My gift ended up wasting her time instead of pleasing her. She finally decided that she had enough and did not want the kindle. But by this time the device was out of the 30 day return period. Amazon only refunded 80% of the original value for a device that was never delivered in working condition. I'm a customer very UNHAPPY with how Amazon handled this whole issue.
5,best birthday present ever,"My husband brought me a Kendle 2 as a birthday present and I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!. I love to read books of all kinds and had them every where. I had them packed in boxes in my closet and under the bed, in book cases and even stacked on my bakers rack in the kitchen. I love to read and couldn't stand the ideal of parting with a book even if I had read it 20 times. Then a co-worker of my husband saw an ad for the Kenle 2 and told him about it. I was so thrilled when I got it. I took it out of the box and started shopping for books. That first day I had bought 3 books and had started reading. I also love the fact that you can download a sample of a book to read just to see if you would like it. I find most of the books are reasonably priced. My huaband is happy that now there are no new books to store in the closet or under the bed. I take my Kendle 2 with me everywhere. This was the best birthday present anyone had ever given me."
4,Gran producto,"A pesar de la mas que discutible escasa calidad de los materiales de fabricación, el producto merece la pena, una pantalla genial y muy rapido en los refrescos de pantalla. Totalmente satisfecho con la compra."
4,LOVE MY KINDLE 'BUT',"I do love my Kindle DX (Global). I know it is early days BUT, now that Kindle has gone international, I trust Amazon is going hell for leather to bring many other international authors on board. I live in Australia and we have countless worthy authors to include such as Tim Winton, Bryce Courtney, Thomas Kenneally, Di Morrissey, Robert Hughes, Peter Cary, David Malouf, Tara Moss to name just a few.Re the Kindle itself; it has re-invigorated my interest in reading as I find it extremely convenient, easy on the eyes, good battery life and an ideal travelling companion. Now that other companies such a Apple, Sony etc. have jumped on the E-book bandwagon, I can only hope that Amazon can keep Kindle to the forefront of E-readers with its subscribers and the publishing industry and not be swept aside by the big brand names."
4,Kindle great product,"Product is great for reading, however, if one could silence the clicking sound when changing the page this would help not to annoy others when reading in bed at night. A built in night lite would also be helpful. I would like to see it have more internet features so one could just carry the Kindle. I expected that the kindle would have had more features that are in tune with most book readers. (hello) We read at night and we like quiet time."
4,Easy reading,"I am in a radio semi-dead spot so getting new titles can be a bind, but after repositioning Kindle OK. Not for use by technophobes, driving it might be easier! On my fourth book no problems other than one that was soon fixed by the support team over the phone(finger trouble).IKI"
4,I gave this product lots of thought,"before buying it. In fact, I was reluctant to part with the $260+; however, after a month, I think that it will turn out to be a good purchase for me. My husband and I travel, so I plan to use my Kindle instead of carrying boxes of books when we go away. I am impressed with the size and its ability to change font sizes to help with these aging eyes. I bought the less expensive version and simply wanted it as a reader. So far I am pleased and love the size since it fits nicely in my purse. I did resent having to buy a cover and would love to see it included. I have downloaded a couple of the ""free"" books and think that is a great feature. We'll see how it works when I go to Florida this winter."
5,Excellent invention,"Honestly talking, I could not imagine that there was a chance to produce such device. Imagine a reading device with a book's size, uses a real ink, able to download any book you wish, easy to carry, beautiful looking, & you may highlight or check the spilling of any single word in any book while using it. Besides marking the page that you have reached & believe it or not; it reads you the book & plays music while you are laying on the beach or having sex ;) of course it should be Kamasutra in this case, lolOverall, it is a damn-fantastic Device and I strongly recommend buying it.Disadvantages:1- Wire-less is only working on US GPS.2- It does not support colored books, even though the black-ink that is used looks like a real book or magazine which is extremely convenient."
4,Kindle 2: A Step Up From the Original,"The Kindle 2 is a definite improvement over the original version. The gray scale and page refresh make it more enjoyable to read and the thinner size is noticeable. I also like the ability to keep books on the Amazon archive and only download what you want (I keep the unread books on the Kindle and the books I have read go back onto the server). One thing I did notice was that the battery life still isn't as long as advertised and I actually have to recharge about 1.25 times a week. Other than that, I am totally pleased with the Kindle 2."
5,I love my Kindle.,I love my Kindle. I have had it for five months now and I can't tell you how many times I have told people I love my Kindle. The best gift I have ever gotten. It was worth every penny. Love it. Love it. Love it.
3,Comments from a pdf user,I am a Kindle user from abroad.For many months I'd been waiting the day Kindle could be bought by users from other countries. One of the reasons I was interested on was the possibility of reading pdf documents.When I received my Kindle the first thing I did was to test how readable could be the pdf files transformed by Amazon via e-mail.The result was clearly disappointing. I need to work with Tables and Charts and Amazon is not ready for it. Amazon announces that complex PDF files may not format correctly on your Kindle. It should say that until a new software is developed you can not read Tables.This problem should be solved in the near term. Thousands of professionals use pdf papers everyday. Amazon should improve the system to give them an answer and finding thousands of clients.
5,i love my kindle2,"before buying my Kindle2 i did a little research between it and the Sony eReader and after gathering as many facts as i deemed necessary, i made my decision. One of the most convincing features for me was the Kindle2 being wireless, it gives me the portability and freedom i need, plus the fact it works exactly as described. I have always been an avid reader, and to be able to get books in 60 seconds or less is absolutely great. I will reccomend this product to my family and friends. Keep up the good work Amazon."
4,kindle in germany,"the product was chosen as a gift. i liked the design and features, but unfortunately the choice of german products is very limited. therefore a kindle in germany can oly be of satisfying use for readers with excellent english language abilities."
3,Could be improved,The hardware is really good and simple to use.It would be better if your books and magazinesalso included danish products and also if youdidnt seperate between usa customers end the rest.
3,Quite good - could be better,"The kindle does what it says on the tin although buyers beware of where you intend to use it. You should be OK if you live in most of the UK; however, it appears that Jersey isn't covered for wireless downloads which us also the case for parts of Europe. It is worth considering that fact if you wish to bring you reading device on holiday and expect to download your daily newspaper or a book. Worth checking first!Other than that, it could do with touch screen like the Sony - maybe thats just me as I am used to using my iPhone and expect everything to be touchscreen now ;)Great weight saver for holidays now that the airlines are being so anal on charging for luggage and enforcing restrictions."
4,Macular Degeneration User,I'm an elderly lady with macular degeneration. I have not been able to read newspaper print for the past three years. Now I can read The New York Times on my Kindle2 with ease... and I'm reading a novel too. I've had my Kindle for one whole week and I think it's the best thing since dark chocolate!
1,Don't buy a Kindle,"This product will take away all your freedom. You wont ""own"" any of the books you ""buy"" from them. They can remove any books they want from your kindle at any time."
1,Amazon = pirates?,You are not the owner of the book you purchase via your Kindle. You just receive a licence which Amazon can revoke without any advance notice. Even worse Amazon can enter your Kindle at any time and delete any book you purchase at Amazon. With the deletion of the book Amazon will also earse all notes you have added to the book.
1,Your Books Aren't Your Own,"This review is for the reprehensible action of Amazon removing from users' Kindles copies of the book 1984 by George Orwell after they had paid for the item. The reason? The publisher changed its mind about offering an electronic version. Does the doctrine of first sale apply here? Apparently not, according to Amazon. It seems that rather than buying a copy of the book, this megacorp interprets the sale as one of license, which they can remove at any time, willy-nilly."
1,Not as promoted!!!!!!,"On March 20th I received my Kindle 2. On Saturday evening, March 21st, I dropped it from the wash basin in the bathroom to the ceramic tile floor. That destroyed it!! It will not work and Amazon will do nothing to replace it. In their promotion on their web page, they demonstrate a 30"" fall and it supposedly still works. Mine fell about the same height and it doesn't.I can have it replaced for an additional $200.00 resulting in an inflated final cost of $559.00. I guess I will just use it for a conversation piece...a very expensive paperweight. Apparently Amazon is not the user friendly organization they would like us to believe."
1,Watch out Non-US Customers,"I ordered a Kindle from Germany, worked well in principle. The Kindle is very slow from the reaction time to key presses, typing on the keyboard is almost impossible.But what is teh worst thing I have had with Amazon was the return process of the device: I had to send it back, because the battery didn't charge properly after 3 days of operation. Usually a normal process: you send it back, get a new one - period. I went to the website, printed a return label, thought I would order a replacement - but that didn't work out! 5 (!) differnt people were telling me, that I didn't order a replacement Kindle, since this is impossible, I should call them (welcome to the 21st century!). I insisted, that I a) printed a return label and sent it back (btw: it's 15 EUR from Europe!) b) ordered a replacement, which they denied.So, we agreed upon a full refund, which I hope is going to take place.So Non-US Customers beware: in case you have a warranty issue, you will be lost."
4,Nice but somewhat slow,Product works well. Wireless is quite slow. They should have put a wireless nic in it and given you the option of another connection type. My wife's biggest complaint is that it is not backlit for reading at night. Needs that badly. Other than that it's a nice product.
5,Kindle and neoprene cover purchase,"Happy it arrived so quickly, looking forward to next travel adventure and using it at that time."
2,Too many options missing,"I was a diasapointed first ti see that no wifi connection for the internet was working in europe, and that no french books were available for kindle on amazon. Then of course the black and white screen with no touch option appears a bit old fashined today."
3,why buy this,Why buy this when you can get a apple Ipad for about the same price and it does so much more than just get books online.
5,Love it,"My friend told me about the kindle I wasn't sold at first because of the price. But once I began to research and learned about its many uses I then thought of it as an investment. The kindle is great, and believe me you will read more. The downloading process is a snap, and to have music playing from from device is an excellent way to enjoy your reading anywhere. I love it."
5,The Amazon Kindle,"I love this product. I have been waiting for something like this for years because I love to read but it's not always convenient to lug a book around. I downloaded a newpaper last week while traveling and didn't disturb anyone around me with all the ruffling of an actual paper. After reading the paper, I went back to a book that I had downloaded. The text to speech option can be odd because the voice will say a title of a chapter and continue into the first line without stopping for a moment like a person would. It tends to stop and start, well, like a computer...which takes a little getting use to. However, I absolutly believe that the ""Amazing"" Kindle, as I call it, it worth every penny."
4,Loved it Until it Broke,"Lasted a year and 3 months (3 months past the one year warranty). It's fragile so treat it carefully and buy a protective holder. The controls suddenly stopped working and then the screen malfunctioned. Instead of buying another one or an iPad, I installed the reader for my PC laptop.During the time it worked it was amazing and wonderful. The screen was sharp and the unit was lightweight. It was an absolute pleasure using it. It was easy to purchase new books and they downloaded quickly. It was easy to use and helped keep my house clutter free (over 100 printed books not piled on the bookcases)Maybe one day they will make a version with a durable frame and screen and I'll get another one. But right now with the economy, I can't afford to spend $350 on a Kindle and replace it 15 months later with another $250 one so I can read a book.PS: The free Kindle PC Reader is not so bad, but the laptop screen doesn't compare to the screen quality of the Kindle."
5,My Kindle,"As part of an effort to clean up my life and to reduce the amount of items I have to travel with, the Kindle is a dream. I truly love it"
5,Kindle lover,"The kindle is great, the only problem there are too many books I want, and Amazon makes it very easy to buy them."
5,Gift for a friend,"I bought this Kindle as a gift for a good friend. I think I have a friend for life! I wish I had bought one for myself... Easy on the eyes, easy to hold and easy to navigate. Great product."
5,Kindle,Love my Kindle! I was a little disappointed to find out that the newer/cheaper version is coming out right after I bought this one but I have no other complaints. I love that you can get a free book sample before you purchase the book. I use it daily and have no problems thus far with downloading and viewing items or battery life.
5,Why did I wait so long?,Why did I wait so long to buy this?I love it!I can carry my whole library with me. It is easy on the eyes and nice to hold.Love it!
4,"Excellent Device, Recommended for Book Lovers, Not Perfect","First, I love the Kindle 2. Absolutely Love it! I just read 3 books over my week-long vacation, something I would have never have done with paper books. The convenience of being able to pull down a new book wherever you are makes it amazing. Additionally, the fact that most books for the Kindle are priced at 1/2 of what you'd pay for the paperback / hardback, means that after reading about 35 books, you'll have it paid off.The only thing that keeps it from being a 5-Star, Perfect Product, is that the interface is still a little sluggish, but most importantly, the contrast ratio just isn't up to snuff. I'm not sure why they can't get black text on a white background, because then it'd be a whole lot easier to read. These are two minor nits."
2,Kindle vs. kindle ap,Waste of money now that my HTC EVO Kindle app (free) can read Kindle Books . Now I just use my app and am selling my Kindle of Ebay. Great concept but already outdated.
1,Terrible customer support,"Mostly I like using Kindle though definitely it has a way for improvement and many flaws. But today for the first time I had to contact their customer support due to some minor sorting issue. The attitude and incompetency of the person addressing my problem was outstanding. He insisted that my device is not even supposed to sort books in any meaningful way, even though is shows such an option and definitely did that before. I wasted 30 minutes listening to such nonsense, until finally found the solution by googling it and fixing it myself. Kindle definitely needs better customer support that will have some idea about the device and its common bugs."
3,My wish for Kindle,Two features I really wish Amazon offered with their Kindle device: ability to share books with family & friends (like the Nook); ability to check out electronic books from my public library (like the Sony eReader and the Nook).
2,"Good Product, poor customer service","I received my kindle for Christmas and was enjoying it until I realized that a book I was reading did not include the last 8%. It has been 2.5 weeks and there is still noresolution to my issue. I am about ready to buy another copy from my local book store. I hope this doesn't happen again.There are a lot of books I won't buy in Kindle form, because the Kindle does not display photos - important with many types of books. Back lighting would be nice, too."
2,Not much good when the wireless is it and miss,"I have been a huge supporter if Kindle since I got my K1. But since I ""upgraded"" to K2 I have had nothing but problems. Cracking of the case - now no whispernet. When I followed onscreen instructions and restarted the K2 I succeeded only in LOSING ALL MY ARCHIVED ITEMS. Progress. I don't think so. iPad I await you."
4,Only One Irritant,"For some reason, and no one can explain to me why, my Kindle locks up and it won't turn on. This has happened twice. I called the ""help desk"" both times and their response was quick and most helpful which fixed the problem, but it is/was still a hassle and frustrating when it happens."
3,Kindle Living Overseas,"Not totally happy for several reasons. Although I use mine I bought it because I can't find my Sony eReader. I thought the instant wireless feature would be great but as an American government employee working and living overseas, not traveling to pay the $1.99 for wireless service is insane. Most of us are here for a minimum of three years. Yes, I can download to the computer for free and I tried that but was charged anyway.Also, I'm disappointed that there is no card slot so I can store my books on an SD Card instead of the Kindle directly. Sometimes I have difficulty when searching for a book and receive a list of what is available, it stops after several pages and I have to start over.The last thing I find frustrating is the lack of magazine choices."
3,Looking to add feedback,"I love my kindle, but I am a little frustrated trying to find the books I love at the price I want to pay. I like fiction-romance and mysteries, but I can purchase the same books on the kindle list for $4.99 in BJ's or Costco. Since I am retired, I read a lot. I don't see the benefit to me to pay $9.99 for something I can get for half that in a discount store. I hope that kindle will consider this and lower their prices. Otherwise, I will have to be very selective in what I purchase and how I use my kindle."
2,No service from north of Brasil,"This is my second Kindle, purchased because the first one did not have overseas capability -- once in north Brasil, I tested and it did not work at all, no downloading capability."
3,Kindle 2 Battery Power,"I purchased this item based on the advertised battery life of around 4 days ( if you don't use the wireless facility). After its initial charge the Kindle lasted for 1 day . I have since charged it again & it seems to be OK.I was a little disappointed to find the wireless only works with ""whispernet"" & not with my own domestic wifi. But this is a minor point..It is very easy to use & the text is clear. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot & cannot afford tthe weight of a lot of books in their baggage..Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, U.S. Wireless)"
4,"Great product, needs a few more features","I love this product. I have read more in the month with the Kindle 2 than I have traditionally in the past year. Books are hard to carry, remember, not the Kindle 2, it fits easily into my purse and goes with me everywhere. Waiting for the check out line, I'm reading....waiting for the pharmacy, I'm reading......waiting for my husband, I'm reading. I love it. Wireless - a main feature for me. Finish your book, get another then and there. The size is perfect for me, I'd perfer the 6"" over the larger version. Archiving is a little quarking and it should definately have a screen backlight for night time reading. Still - I love it."
5,Great product,My kindle arrived quickly. It's very useful and the wireless connection works very well in Brazil
3,"Amazon, promising birth, slow to evolve","The Kindle itself is a reasonably good product; however the fact that Amazon have failed to negotiate agreements through which it can sell any of its products to people in Australia, at all or on the same basis as other areas of the world, is a continuing disappointment.Numerous times I have entered a purchase through Amazon, only to be told at a very late stage of the process, that Amazon is unable or unwilling to sell that product to someone in Australia!The Kindle also is sold by Amazon under disadvantageous circumstances to people in Australia, compared with other parts of the world.For a company that made its name through innovative marketing and sales, this is very disappointing performance."
5,"can't live without it,",I love my Kindle. It goes everywhere with me.I wish however that it was backlighted. Attachinga light takes away from the beauty of it's lines
3,I should have waited!,"April -- Just got it - opened the box and there were the books I had ordered yesterday. WOW! The kids are fighting over it and screaming for their own. I'll update later, but my initial, out of the box response is -- WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG? Also got the M-Edge Leather case for it - feels and smells like a Dooney & Bourke!Bought one on June 4th for Father's DAy -- boy, I should have waited. About 2 weeks after I bought it, the price went down by $70.00. Pretty upset that not even an offer of partial refund or anything. Let the buyer beware!"
1,Poor service,"Reading on the Kindle is a good experience. The problem is in the quality of the Kindle itself. I have had 3. Two of them had defects. My first one had screen issues within a year. It was replaced with one that had connection issues. I thought it was just a bad connection at my house. I could download from the PC but not directly to the Kindle. When I went on vacation I discovered it would not connect anywhere. I called customer service. For over a week, they tried various fixes. When it could not be resolved, they offered to replace it for a $99 service fee. I also lost one when I put it on the top of the car and carelessly drove off. Despite the fact that the device must be registered and they know when it is in use, they said there was nothing they could do unless I could find even a small piece of it. In that case they would send me a new one half price. I have had a Nook since February. So far, so good.Susan Pitts"
1,Just say no!,My favorite author who publishes 2+ books a year is no longer available on kindle because Amazon and Penguin will not sign a contract. I got this as a Christmas gift and now wish I had gone with a different e reader. I really do like my kindle but if I can't get the books I really love to read it is worthless!
3,Wish is wasn't so expensive,I have looked at them online for a long time. They are still way to expensive. I'll just continue to read paperbacks because hardbacks are too heavy.
3,Availability of Books,"I just received my Kindle Reader in the mail today. I thought I had done my research on this device as thoroughly as possible. I obviously missed something. I was under the impression that when purchasing this electronic reader, it was already loaded with some books, except newer releases. After familiarizing myself with the user instructions, I realized that I had to purchase any book, newspaper, etc. in order to read it. In order to make certain of this I called the toll free customer Kindle assistance number and was reassured any material I planned on reading needed to be purchased first. Although many of the materials are at nominal cost, it would have been helpful to have Amazon make this more transparent that a purchase for any book, etc. is required."
3,Uncovered,"I loved my Kindle since the first day I opened it. Newspapers, books, magazines all in one easy place and convenient to store. Then I did the unthinkable. I traveled with my Kindle. Outside the US, forget it. Southeast Alaska out of luck. Too many dead spots. Bezos really needs to make coverage universal in the US and needs to make international connection possible. I've been in Alaska 10 days and have been analog (real books). Major disappointment."
5,A book lover must!,"Book Readers must get a Kindle. You won't believe you ever lived without one. I received this as a gift from my husband, who never knows what to buy. I fell in love at first download! Now this baby goes everywhere with me. It's sleek, light, easy to operate, tough (I've dropped it twice!) and it thrills my instant gratification need for new reading material within a minute!!! Get it, try it, fall in love with it."
4,Kindle II,I receive my kindle last month as a Mother's Day and Birthday Present. I just purchased books for it last week. I love it but now I have a l-inch fade out and can not read the first two lines on each page. Can not get to customer services.
1,Trading Books,"You've gotta have a way to trade books with your friends or your book club. Charge us more for the book, but let us at least share them. Reading a book once and then storing it forever is expensive and wasteful."
2,Warranty issues with Kindle 1,"I received a Kindle 1 as a Christmas present in 2008. In May 2009 (approximately 6 months after reciept) the Kindle developed a screen problem and was replaced by Amazon under warranty. I received the replacement Kindle on June 2nd. On July 27th the replacement Kindle began to lock up. The only way I could get it to function was to remove the battery and reinstall and then the Kindle would ""reboot"". It would lock up again after about 10 -15 minutes of use and I would repeat the whole process. I again called Amazon and they are again sending me a replacement Kindle. Hopefully this one will be more reliable and I won't have to replace in another 45 - 90 days. I enjoy the Kindle and am appreciative to Amazon for thier fairness and promptness in replaced the defective Kindles, however I just simply want a device that works and does not require frequent replacing."
1,No Warranty Support,"I purchased this item for a friend and she loves it. However, the screen cracked and Amazon has no repair options on this unit. I was told that for another $200., they would send me another unit. I DON'T THINK SO! Amazon will loose my business because of this issue."
3,Amazon increases prices,"In the month since I received my Kindle I have noticed the price of new releases has increased from 9.99 to about 14.50 (an increase over 50%). Here's a suggestion--Amazon users boycott anything priced over 9.99.New releases will lack the sales that would elevate their best seller status, and Amazon will get no revenue from its up-pricing strategy."
4,Kindle 2,"Easily one of the most addictive devices I've ever purchased. Reading is easy under any of the conditions I've tried so far - full sun, desk lamp, general room lighting.Finding books is easier on a computer. The recommended list is too short and oddly off target. Maybe version 3 fixes this."
5,Kindle 2nd generation,"I purchased the Kindle for a family vacation. I usually take 4 or 5 books with me. With the Kindle I had 9 books at my fingertips, it was so lightweight that after a 12 hour drive my arms were not tired. I really love how easy it is to buy books and how fast I receive them. My husband even mentioned how happy I seem we my Kindle. I'm very happy with it."
4,"Awesome reader, wish I'd waited a few weeks","Bought this device because (a) the price finally dropped to below $200 and (b) I was about to go off on 2 weeks vacation. Enjoyed the reader during the vacation (camping on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia) both as a reader and as a wireless web browser (""experimental"") -- this was first vacation in years on which I did not bring a laptop. Location was remote and outside the coverage area on the map, but I was still able to (just barely) access Gmail and Red Sox scores. Also tried subscribing to New York Times and Boston Globe, which worked OK (though not my cup of tea for normal times.)Main complaint I have is: my home in Vermont is outside Kindle (ATT) wireless coverage area -- total dead zone -- and transferring content to the device via PC/USB is a moderate hassle. On my return from vacation, I found that the latest Kindle model -- at the same price -- has *WiFi* in addition to WhisperNet access, which would be ideal for home use. ::sigh::"
5,Best gadget ever!,"Fabulous! I love it! I bought this so that I could lighten my load of academic reading, but have found that I really enjoy reading for personal enjoyment with the Kindle too!"
5,wow,"I have always enjoyed reading, but hated the hassel of droping the book, etc., and having to find the page again. This is the best thing I have purchased in a long time, well worth the money, and easy to us. Just Love it , Love it, Love it!!!!"
4,Light weight reading,"I love the Kindle 2. When I travel I usually take a canvas bag of books with me. Now I only have to pack the Kindle in my purse and it's oh so light! The one downside is that it is not back lit for night time reading. However, that problem is easily solved for about $12.00. A little reading light that clips on nicely to the device. And I love that it is wireless and you can order books, newspapers, magazines right from the device with a less than 60 seconds delivery time. COOL!!!"
5,Love my Kindle,"It's just great to shop for books online and not have to wait for delivery, or drive down to the bookstore. We are also saving money on the newest titles! I'm reading more now, and playing games online less. I even converted my husband, and my 17 year old daughter asked to borrow my Kindle. That's amazing!"
3,Screen Self Destructed!,"My husband got this for me, and three days after he got it, the Kindle self destructed. I could not read the screen anymore, and it looked like the ink had ran on the inside of the screen. This is definitely not what I had expected and was quite disppointed. Amazon did say they will replace it, so that is good. But, we have to go through the hassle of mailing the old broken one back, received the new one, and uploading all the old information onto the new one, etc. Amazon really needs to do some research into this (because I know this is an occurring problem with Kindles). Btw, we got the NEW Kindle, and that is the one that self destructed."
4,Wonderful Device...but with price issues and not enough books/magazines,"The way I look at it...you can have a pricey device and the choice to pay way less for downloadable books OR you can have a less expensive device and have less of a discount on books. It's sort of like buying a hybrid vehicle...you're going to pay up front for the gas you save over the long haul. There's no big difference in overall cost. Amazon is a business and they are in it to make money.What I'd really love to find is a service that let's me pay a reasonable monthly fee to rent or ""check out"" books instead of purchasing them. I don't re-read most books and those I do are reference manuals.The Kindle 2 is an awesome device but an awesome device is nothing without a wide range of material to view on it. Amazon has the device down. Now, they need to work on more literature...maybe work with Google in their license to make every book available in digital format."
2,Clever but costly,"I like the device. It's nothing fancy but functions well. It is much easier than breaking out a laptop. But you would expect a great product for close to $400.BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE. The Kindle subscriptions are going to drain you dry. I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Amazon is collecting almost $26.00 per month ($312 annually) for those two newspapers.I am a huge Amazon fan but I cannot recommend this product and would return mine given the chance. In fact, I will like post it for sale on eBay soon."
1,Way too expensive,My opinion is that Kindle is way way way too expensive. Guess I'll stick to reading glasses and books with large print.
2,Get the price down!,"I love the idea of this device,but in today's economy??You NEED to find a way to drive the price DOWN!Keep working, Amazon :)"
3,Books leverage,"A nice addition to the service I have not seen in the offer would be to allow past purchasers of paper books on Amazon to be able to download the kindle version of the same books for free.Please feel free to send me any present you would like to (including a shining Kindle appliance :-) ), should you appreciate the suggestion..."
2,Only U.S. Coverage,It's incredibly stupid that they chose a CDMA radio so that it will only work in the U.S. IT would have been incredibly useful to have access to my morning paper while travelling in any country.
1,Beware of it's Exclusiveness,"What a mistake. I thought I would have access to download through my computer as we are not in the proprietory wireless whispernet area. Not so. Even though amazon says you can, in reality you can't, because as soon as you try to purchase a book to just download at a later date on mymanagekindle site, the purchase won't go through because you are not in Amazaon's recognized geographic area. This unit is useless in Canada and I am sending it back."
3,good if you live in a city!,"I was very eager to buy this- I loved the look and the idea of the convenience of it all. The only problem is downloading the books. i live in Central Maine, and despite the map showing adequate coverage, I can't connect with the store. I tried it all over the state, and only was able to connect in Portland. Makes the usefulness of the device limited! That being said, I recently took it on vacation and downloaded and enjoyed books there. I would really love to subscribe to a newspaper, but I guess I'll have to wait until I move to a different state."
3,"Great idea, good hardware, so-so (or no) proof-reading","Kindle proved itself when I went through minor but time-consuming skin surgery. I finished one book in the waiting room, then ordered another. Presto: one minute and had my reading fix for the next few hours. But -- On books that require a software reading of printed pages (older titles where Amazon can't get hold of the original discs, I guess), the typos are frequent and disconcerting. ""The Path Between the Seas"" had literally hundreds. In ""Democracy in America"" the software's reading of ""Trust"" turned up as ""Lust."" Maybe fewer titles, more proofreading would be good?"
3,Kindle 2.0 has multiple bugs.,"I recently bought Kindle 2 and while I am generally happy with the device, it has multiple bugs, which I would consider to be show stoppers for a release of a product like Kindle. One example - I bough a kindle book ""Future of Management"" by Gary Hamel. While I love the book, multiple words appear joined or dashed for no reason. This makes reading somewhat annoying - something that you would absolutely not expect from a printed version. Also, when I finish reading and go to home screen, if I was to put my device to sleep and then wake it, returning to the book places me on the last page that I left, however using ""prev page"" functionality takes me to several pages back, not to the immediate previous page. I like the device, but wish it did not have these bugs. What's the deal?"
5,I love technology!!,"You know, I have been a life-long reader and always enjoyed the heft and weight of a good book. I thought I would miss that and the page turning...NOT!! Slipping a 300 page book into my pocket-book is not an option and if I am close to the end of a book, I would need to take two along...never again! Waiting rooms are my friend. I can now read in bed without keeping my husband awake with the page turning and cover-rattling. Love it!!"
1,switching to apple ipad,"I have purchased two kindle for my wife in six months. The first one locked up after 3 months, at that time there were no fixes. So when the second Kindle locked up I was glad to see that I could purchase a battery and fix both units. The parts arived but I am unable to ""unlock"" either of the units. My wife will not allow me to spend any more money with amazon for the electronic books that keep locking up."
3,why kindle when you can ipad?,"why would anyone buy this with the apple ipad on the way out? it can do everything the kindle can do and about 135,000 other things that the kindle can't even touch! plus it will have it's own bookstore that will have all the same titles as amazon does. this thing is dead. i'd say they have about six months lifespan left in them once the pad hits and then it's all over. unless amazon can pull a tremendous price reduction and still afford to make them, then they might hang on as second tier or third behind google."
3,No Color? FAIL!,"Wont buy a Kindle until they have color. A paperback has full color and printed pictures. Black, Grey, White is not the same thing!Kindle FTL!"
1,Death to kenny,I hate this this thing no mp3s and I always seem to click on it on zons home page die kendwl die
3,Where are the books?,"I like the Kindle. It's easy to use, compact for travel, and good for the environment (Just think of all those trees we're saving). But it's very limited in content. I couldn't find the last three books I wanted to read on it. Just yesterday, I tried to download the novel, Slumdog Millionaire, which was published only a few years ago. No luck. Instead, some book by a different author popped up. I've heard Bezos say that his goal is to have available every book ever published. Sounds great, but the Kindle has a long way to go."
2,a question,"This is not a review but a question for amazon and the Kindle community: if you live abroad (ie NOT in the US) can you download books to your Kindle? If not, why not? How in this day and age could a product like this be designed to work ONLY in the United States?Thanks for any infoBillAsia2000"
2,"Kindle2, big name for little promise","The available technical books are so expensive, the physical copy is even cheaper.the user interface is not very nice, I accedentally purchased books like three times.the five way button is hard to operate specially when the transparent film is over it.google and wikipedia browsing is not as flexible.it is not colored.the dictionary is very nice"
1,Poor product,Still can't see why someone would want a service to where they don't own what they legally purchase. Due to the recent fiasco with Amazon deleting the two George Orwell books I have no desire to ever purchase one of these. Poor product in my opinion.
1,problematic platform design.,"The kindle has the potential to be a great platform, but is unfortunately defective by design, and uses DRM. It also abuses the rights of users by never allowing the user to actually own the books they pay for.The hardware seems pretty good, it's just too bad that the business model is from the last century rather than this one."
1,Mostly Junk,"The hardware is great. I love the screen. The problem is with the software. It allows Amazon to change the contents of your Kindle at any time and on any whim of desire. When you ""buy"" a book, you are really paying Amazon to let you rent it until they don't want you to have it anymore.Want to pass that book to a family member or friend, tough! It's stuck on that device until it dies, then you have NOTHING!"
1,Amazon deletes your books,"When i could stop laughing I decided to write this review:Amazon deleted some ""unauthorized"" copies of my two favorites books last week: 1984 and Animal farm. Talk about Big brother...There is nothing more irritating than to get home and find that a burglar has taken all your book from your library, but at lest he does that for free, not like amazon.com, that bills you to rob you! Fantastic, I say.And remembe, in Amazon Kindle, BOOK reads you!"
4,Kindle book reader,Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend.He loves it. Although he wishes there was a backlight for readingat night
5,Great Invention!,Love to read. This invention saves time & money. Highlighting and note writing is a great plus.
5,My Kindle Review,This was a gift for my wife for her birthday. She does a lot of reading and it is easier for her to take the Kindle with her when she goes somewhere than it is a book. The downloads are very easy to use and there are lots and lots of books that are free. When you need to buy one the prices are very reasonable. Best of all you do not have to go anywhere to get a book and if the book is from a library it has to be returned. My wife is very happy with her Kindle.
4,Joe's Kindle,"I was using my phone as an e-reader before I got the Kindle. Now I don't know why I was attempting to read books that way, turning the page every few lines was tedious to say the least. Having to download the book to my computer and then installing it on my phone was also a pain. I enjoy my Kindle, I can search for books, download a few chapters directly to the Kindle, see if the book interests me and then if I like it just purchase it directly from the Kindle. Very cool."
5,Everything I wanted!,"I absolutely love the Kindle. It is easy to use, easy to read and easy to download new books.The pages turn quickly and I have so enjoyed the ease of having an instant book. No waiting forbook delivery or driving to the book store. If you are an avid reader, Kindle is for you!"
5,My Kindle,"I've had my Kindle for several weeks now and I really enjoy it. I know it's not going to be perfect, but it's only frozen one time. It was when I was pushing a button too quickly over and over. Overall it's great! I love the freedom of being able to carry it about with me in my purse and read a book anytime.It downloads books quickly and there are many free books to try out. So far I have enjoyed it immensely!"
5,I love my Kindle!,"I received my Kindle2 on Wednesday this week and I can't say enough about how much I love it! I have taken it and shown it to several of my friends and I'll bet that I've made 4 sales in just 3 days.The print is incredibly easy to read and no trying to get the pages to remain flat like you do in a regular book.We visit our home in Mexico about four times a year, and I always, in the past, have had a carry-on bag that contained nothing but books; (reading is what I like to do there between snorkeling and swimming). I'm a voracious reader when I have the time, and it's not unusual for me to take 10 - 12 books with me. No more of that! I'll just slip my Kindle in my bag and be done with it.I find the voice reader to be incredible life-like. I really expected it to sound like a computer and it doesn't.I find nothing to dislike and everything to love! Five stars!"
2,Kindle in Italy,"This is my second Kindle 2, first a ""non"" International one, came in spring from US with a friend.More than happy with the first, probably expected too much from the second.Speed in getting books over the connection is not worth the money, I do understand it is the provider that is not up to standards, but probably it needs to be changed.Want me happy?Family needs books in Italian, at least those for the kid, she is 4.Want me more than happy?I do not want to buy a Kindle DX ""not"" International, and too many downloads are in that format.Ciaom"
2,needs some work still,Got this thing 4 days ago as it wasn't available in the UK before that. The idea and the usability are good. Downloading books from Amazon is easy and the user interface is alright. Readability is great but:The device is a bit too big to fit into any pocket so will have to carry a bag if I take it anywhere. Given the small size of the screen it should really be a bit smaller. The keyboard is very erratic and has quite a bit of unpredictable delay before doing anything.The content is much more expensive when bought from the UK with titles that sell for 99 cents to Americans going for more than 3 Dollars.If you want to subscribe to newspapers they don't deliver any of the pictures to the UK which really defeats the purpose.As long as Amazon thinks it can use Europeans as second class cash cows I will have to wait for someone else to get it right before buying more contents. Luckily there is a lot of free contents around with special mention to manybooks...
2,Have not found a way to enlarge tables or drawings with Kindle,I have not found a way to enlarge tables or drawings. This is a hugedraw back when trying to read manuals. Sometimes it adds a space or removesspaces in text which usually isn't a big deal. Over all the quality is good.I would like to see Kindle come up with a new format for delivering readabletable content. b
2,unable to connect to wireless networks,"The Kindle is a good device for reading, but at least in France, it is unable to connect to any wireless provider?You have to download the books first to your computer, and then by USB to the Kindle."
5,"Great product, Great customer support","I have owned a Kindle 2 for over a year now. I am an avid reader and use it constantly. It was very easy and fairly intuitive to learn how to use. I loved it so much, that I got another one for my best friend. I had an issue with my original Kindle 2. It's display cracked because of a design flaw. I called Amazon Kindle support and they had a new one to me THE VERY NEXT DAY! I read a variety of genres and have not had any issue finding the books I like/want in Kindle format. This is the best device I have purchased in a decade."
4,Easy transition,"As a book lover I was hesitant to jump on the e-reader bandwagon, but honestly I love the convenience and style of the Kindle 2. I am reading more since it's easy to carry. It even made the wait at the post office on April 15th go by fast!"
1,Problems galore.,"I bought this product for my birthday on January 5, 2010. Since that date I've had to exchange the Kindle no less than four times! One wouldnt let me hear audiobooks, two had battery problems, one fell from my bed and shattered (my bed being like a foot tall, so not a big distance). I am not pleased."
4,Living with my Kindle,"My Kindle shows a battery low signal every hour of so of use, I usually ""X"" out the message and go on using it. Also I am not in a coverage area and have to travel 20 to 30 miles away from home to connect to the network. Other than these minor problems all is well and enjoyable about the Kindle. Q: is there any way to delete the pictures of authors that show up?"
4,In Spanish (Proceso de entrega y primeras impresiones),"Hola, el proceso de compra y entrega ha sido bastante bueno. Lo solicité desde España un lunes y el jueves estaba listo para la entrega por DHL. El único pero es que no tenían bien mi documento de identidad y se retrasó por ese motivo en la aduana. Lástima el coste de 38 que cargan adicionales.Mis primeras impresiones son muy buenas, la velocidad entre páginas es buena, y el acceso por 3G para navegar por la tienda y ver la wikipedia es bueno incluso en poblaciones de poca cobertura.Me gusta leer en inglés, pero sería muy bueno el disponer de libros en español. También tengo varios libros en inglés que hubiese comprado pero que no lo he hecho por no estar disponibles para kindle. Un acierto el poder pasar ya pdfs de forma directa.Un saludo."
5,Love it!,I'm so glad I bought the Kindle. I just finished my first book. I travel a lot and the Kindle is making it easy to read on planes and airports. I can't imagine traveling without it.
3,Kindle 3G 2nd Generation,"It is comfortable and easy to handle. I love that you can read it outside in sunshine and that you can change the font size. Overall, it is ok. Froze once. I would be upset if this happened on vacation and will have to travel with a paper book as backup which defeats the purpose of owning one. The tiny joystick is a bit awkward. I don't like that I cannot download ebooks from the public library and I cannot lend books. Probably would have gone with the wirless version that just came out for $139. I kind of wish I had bought a Nook."
3,Kindle Review,I am already a big fan after limited use.But I'm spending the next fortnight in the tropics of Solomon Islands. So I will find out just how durable it is.
5,great item but it's not without problems,"i have had a kindle 2 for about 2 years now, i love this product. my job has me traveling all the time so the kindle saves me an enourmous amount of space and i can download newspapers from home everywhere i've been so far. now on to the problem, the only problem with the kindle that i have encountered is that the screen is damaged very easily. if a hard plastic cover could be made for the kindle it would make this product just about perfect. amazon has made many improvements to the kindle over the years but they do not seem to be doing anything about the problem with the easily damaged screen. Amazon PLEASE fix this problem!"
4,Kindle Purchase,The purchase was very smooth and it arrived exactly as described. I find the Kindle to be very convenient. I just wish there was an internal light you could just switch on when you needed it instead of having to attach one.
5,An amazing machine,"I prefer this to reading a normal book any day, though of course, the Kindle has a much more limited selection. However, when it comes to reading new books, the Kindle is the way to go. I'm saving money because the books are so much cheaper. Awesome. I love this thing."
1,Protest against this,"Think about the name. ""Kindle"" means to start a fire; in the context of a device intended to replace conventional, printed books, it is ominous and even fascistic. The implication is that the device renders those heavy, space-consuming, paper books useless for any purpose other than burning. It is my sincere hope that this device will go the way of quadraphonic sound and the Betamax, remembered only as another quaint gizmo from the late 2000s."
1,Too Expensive,"As stated by another reviewer, if they lowered it to around $100.00, I'm sure they would sell many more and make their profits from the downloads. Another wait and see guy................"
2,no wonder they held the price down- they give you less,just got my new kindle. since we also have the original we looked at the slim box it came in and low and behold we discovered that amazon no longer supplies a kindle holder to protect it. so now i have to go buy one of these.YOU know it doesnt cost them more to produce the newer model.so this is how they increase profits on 2 sidesmore for the unit- more for a kindle holdershame on you amazon.
1,It's not THAT hard!,"Amazon,When you make a version of the Kindle that IS back-lit, I'll buy one.... but not until. It's not THAT hard! I really wish you would....."
5,Love that kindle,"Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)I absolutely love my Kindle2. I bought it primarily for the variable text size capability. I use it for walking on my treadmill. I know that exercise is essential for life but I think it is boring after about 3 minutes. I was never able to read a regular paperback book. Now the Kindle 2 with the variable text size & easy page turning is quite literally a ""life saver"" for me."
3,Upload Kindle Software to read PDF files and use Landscape,"Recently I bought the Kindle Wireless device, 6"" display, latest generation, but i found that this device can't read directly PDF file and don't have the LANDSCAPE function as I received it from factory. So, if you have this problem you must check the software version in your Kindle (In the Menu option). In my case I had the 2.2.2 version and I had to download an update file that runs automaticaly in the Kindle once I'd drop the file to the device via the USB connection. Once you run the update, you can read PDF files and use the Landscape function.I suggest to Amazon that this feature to read PDF files comes in the FACTORY DEFAULTS of the Kindle to avoid a misundestarding."
3,Poor Illustrations but otherwise...,"I like the Kindle--I don't mind the page refresh when moving from one page to the next--I like the text sizing feature--I like the feel of the Kindle. I backpack and so was hoping that I could use this for bringing reference guides with me when a hike. But the illustrations are very poor. You cannot enlarge them and so details and labels are very hard to read--plus they are only in black and white. This does little good for plant and bird identification. So while I like what they've done so far, I am sorely disappointed about it's limitations."
5,Kindle,Love my new Kindle I received for Christmas. It was ready to go pretty much out of the box. I like reading on my Kindle as I find that my eyes don't seem to get tired as fast as they would if I was reading a paperback. If you love to read this is definitely a must have!
5,Love It!,"I had been looking at the Kindle for a year. I had looked at the Sony Reader and the Nook as well. I was a little nervous about buying a reader since I am a ""book"" person...something about turning a page. Anyway, I took the plunge and bought the Kindle on Friday 3/12/10. I had it shipped overnight so I had it on Saturday. After I charged the battery I was ready to go.(You can still read / navigate while battery is charging) I was instantly in love!The Kindle is so easy to navigate and I had two books purchased in a matter of seconds and was off and reading. And the best part: I didn't even have to leave the comfort of my recliner.A friend from work ask me to bring it on on Monday so we could compare readers since she has the Sony reader. She has made mention several times that she my return the Sony and buy a Kindle."
5,I LOVE MY NEW KINDLE!!!,"WHAT A GREAT BUYING PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH,IT WAS TOO EASY,THE NEXT DAY IT SHOWED UP ON MY DOORSTEP ,THEY KEPT ME INFORMED THRU ALL THE STEPS,I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS E-BOOK,EVEN I CAN USE IT ,MY HUSBAND TORE SOMETHING IN HIS KNEE, HAD TO BE OFF FOR A WEEK OR SO ,DOWNLOADED THE TYPE OF BOOKS HE LIKED AND HE WAS GOOD TO GO,NOW I MUST GET IT BACK .THANKS"
5,Thrilled,"I absolutely love my Kindle! It is everything I wanted. LOVE the portability, ease of use, quick downloads. Looking forward to many hours of pleasure-filled reading!!"
5,Mobile Library,"Ever since i received my kindle i never set my eyes off it. I really enjoy reading through this device. My kindle has been with me daily and i like when people asked what is it that i'm holding in my hand, and i just smiled at them and said ""My reading device, my Kindle, My everything""."
4,Yellow Butterfly Girl,I received the Kindle for Mother's Day and I love it!! All avid readers should save up their pennies and get one!
5,LOVE MY KINDLE,"I HAVE HAD MY KINDLE JUST A FEW WEEKS BUT ALREADY LOVE IT. IT IS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN MY PURSE, SO NO MATTER WHERE I AM I HAVE SOMETHING TO READ WHEN I AM WAITING FOR SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. I READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EVERY DAY AND HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED SEVERAL BOOKS. IT IS EASY TO READ AND MUCH HANDIER THAN A BOOK. IT KNOWS RIGHT WHERE I AM AT IN THE BOOK WHEN I OPEN IT AND IT IS VERY EASY TO NAVIGATE FOR PURCHASING NEW MATERIAL.IT IS DEFENITELY THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE SO FAR IN 2009."
5,Love my Kindle!!,"I am in my eighties and have Parkinson's Disease. It has been some time since I have read one of my favorite mystery novels, as books are heavy for me to hold. I also must have large print. Kindle has solved both these problems. I have already enjoyed one book and am reading the second in comfort. Thank you for making my life more pleasant."
5,Great tool for multi-tasking,My rationale for purchasing the Kindle 2 was to leverage my productivity while in-flight and while on the ground waiting to board. The Kindle 2 combined with Amazon's WhisperNet allow me to translate common digital document formats and transfer their content to my Kindle. Then this content is readily available for my review without lugging out the laptop. This important feature is in addition to the commercial content that is available.
4,"Love the kindle But, I want more new releases","I love my Kindle, however; I would like to have more new book releases.I find the options are limited."
4,Better Than I Expected!,"I am an avid reader - who travels extensively worldwide. Although I liked the concept of the device, I was not sure I would like the idea of not having an actual book in my hands where I could flip the pages. However, I welcomed the idea of being able to load numerous books, newspapers and magazines on one system without having to load my backpack down with these media. I purchased the Kindle and have to admit that I love it! This is a device that I use everyday, whether I'm at home or in a hotel. It is so convenient to take with me anywhere. I am so happy that I made the decision to purchase. I do recommend this device."
5,Kindle2,"Amazon has done it again. Shipping was two days ahead of schedule. The Kindle was packed great. Thought I would never get into it. Once I did though, it was unpack and use. All my downloads were right there. Th experimental music caused me some delay but I soon figured it out. I suspect it will get easier as time goes on. I am now reading and listening and have only had the Kindle less than an hour...Now my wife wants one too...."
5,"Love books, love the Kindle too!","Like most people, I wasn't sure how I would transition from paper books to the electronic book format. I can only confirm the 8 billion other reviews that LOVE this product. I immediately loaded a pile of books onto it and took it on vacation to the Bahamas. I sat on the beach, drank pina coladas and read all week long. It was sweet. I will never give up my weekly outings to the bookstore, nor will I ever lose my love for the beautiful hardcover books that line shelves all over my home. The Kindle merely allows me to read in a whole new way. Having hands free to do other things (exercise, iron, cook) while reading only makes my life a happier place to live. Yay Kindle."
3,.......,"I am mostly dissapointed, I recieved this Kindle as a gift. I was exstatic, when I had my Kindle I used it everyday and liked it alot. The only feature I didn't really like was the screen, I was hoping it would light up because I LOVE reading at night. This didn't happen. I was content until the screen BROKE. I was careful with it, I didn't want to test the durability, but I handed it to my friend for one second and he dropped it. I was extremly angry and upset but there wasn't anything I could do about it. I was hoping there would be some type of repair service but there is not. I am not using this review to complain. I however wish for you to really think about buying this. It is very fragile I have read MANY reports just like this. Buyer beware handle with extreme care. The only thing they could possibly do for you is for you to get a new one, or a refurbished model. It doesn't seem like a good idea at all. Very expensive and the other model might not work as well."
3,Kindle,"It worked well. Very functional if you already have a computer and you just want to be able to access and read book anywhere / anytime. It a good little e reader and if i could afford it, I'd keep it. But I need a computer. I don't have one currently so I have to sacrifice the kindle to put that money towards that.SO to sum up. If you already have a computer. And you like to read. Get a kindle. THey are so easy to take with you and easy to use.I'm really sad to see mine go back:("
5,Kind Kindle,"Portable, useful, ready to use every where, but, it came late, you say in your advertising ""1 day shipping if you buy before Dec, 24th"" and it came on Dec. 30th, and I have to go and pick it off 'cause they did not deliver it, they say that they had been at home and that was not true, I was at home all that day and they did not came."
5,Kindle,"Very nice but: 1. if the book you buy was poorly copied you will have to read it with blurred images (my example: Robert Ludlum's The Moscow Vector) and 2. If you buy a book based on its title you will end up paying for something you did not want nor will read (my example: Robert Ludlum: A Critical Companion - Gina Macdonald - I thought it was a novel but it was an analysis of Ludlum's books. If you are not in High School, you do not want it!)"
3,KINDLE WORKS WELL NEEDS BACKLIGHT,"After receiving the Kindle for Christmas I have used it faithfully every day reading for an hour or two. I really enjoy the ease of use and the ability to order N/C sample books to determine if the author/ title is something I will enjoy. Easy to use and simple to order new books makes this user friendly once you get your account set up.I am struggling to read in less than perfect lighting conditions, the device should be back lit to make night reading easier... Today I have tried to order a reading light to clip on, Amazon will not ship me the light to Canada, funny though as my money for the device was readily taken....and shipped it to my door. I have emailed Amazon today requesting a light to be shipped accross the border, we'll see how their customer service works."
2,Amazon Messes Up on Good Device,"Ordered a Kindle as a gift for a friend. Some dimwit at Amazon thought it would be nice to initialize the device with MY name prior to shipping. So the recipient opens it, turns it on and sees MY name. Looks like a second hand gift.Between this and some Amazon USPS misadventures, Amazon is rapidly dropping as a preferred vendor for my needs."
2,"Sorry, completely unimpressed ...","First, I'm a huge Amazon fan, an Amazon Prime customer for several years. So, it pains me to put this in writing.I was totally unimpressed with the Kindle 2 and returned it to Amazon with a two page letter explaining my disappointment - which I won't repeat here.Besides the fact that it didn't work (my NY Times - Daily News not only didn't update ""several times a day"" the way it was advertised to, it didn't even update once a day). Tech support (speaking Irish) was helpful - sort of.The user interface was totally unimpressive, the controls flimsy, the display only so-so.Sorry Amazon."
5,"Love my Kindle, but...","The Kindle Two is awesome. I'm a late adopter. Did not own the first one and don't own an ipod. However, for anyone who is an ecclectic reader and doesn't want to deal with papers and books in huge numbers around the house or apartment, Kindle is a blessing. I travel and there is no better way to read on a plane or train.I have a three wishes for Kindle:I wish that page numbers, as would be placed in the printed version, were shown on the Kindle page bottom. The percentage read is helpful, but it needs a page number. I realize that depending on font size selected, several screens might have the same page number.Second, I wish that the chapter were shown on each page. This is helpful in getting back to a spot or, if reading a Bible selection, knowing which book you are in.Third, I wish that Amazon would start a Kindle Library. This would be where books are available to be read once at a very low price, but not owned. I don't need to own the books that I read on Kindle."
5,Kindle2...thanks Amazon... you got it right this time,"I simply love this device. It is smart, efficient, light and amazing. I didnt like Kindle1's form factor but with Kindle2 I am a completely satisfied customer. No need to think...just act and buy it!"
5,Love my Kindle,"This is one of the best things I have ever bought. I love to read and have been having difficulties in holding on to the books (carpal tunnel issues) I also have trouble with the small print. The Kindle is so light to hold,or I can lay it down and still read. Bbeing able to change the size of the font solved my seeing issues and I never lose my page when I put it down (unlike regular books). Being able to download books while on the go is a fantastic option. Nothing I hate more than finishing one book in the series and not having the next ready to read. With the Kindle that does not happen. I just go online and download and start reading."
5,Kindledictive,I have had my Kindle now for 4 weeks. I am also addicted to it! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it but just wished it had a NON-slippery whatever stuck on the back of it so when holding it to read it didn't slip away from you. KINDLE PEOPLE DESIGNERS......another idea!I feel really bad for those who have had problems. Considering how much I use mine I could not handle those types of problems It has become my companion totally.What a great idea also for all the bed-bound patients in the hospitals. Although someone has already tried to steal my Kindle at a doctor's appointment I had last week! Don't leave site of your Kindle!!!!!
5,Great Reader!,"I've researched the Kindle for about two years before actually buying one and it more than exceeds my expectations. It's ease of use and high portability make it an ideal companion on my trips, be it to the doctor's wating room, standing in line at the DMV or on vacation.The reading experience is so natural that my first few times using it I actually tried to physically turn the page.Looking forward to a long association with the Kindle 2."
5,Kindle 2 amazing technology and support,"The Kindle 2 has proven to be temendous technology and is the best gift I have ever received. My first system developed a screen error and we had to call customer service. Customer service was extemely friendly and upon discovering that the error was not correctible, sent me a new unit, which I received the next day. I've had no problems with the second unit and Amazon paid the shipping to return the damaged system.Would recommend to anyone who loves to read."
5,advice,"I think that the Kindle product is amazing. Some may criticize it for only being able to do one thing but what it does do, it does exceptionally well. I especially love being able to receive The New York Times and being able to read it where ever I am. I do however, have one piece of advice for the creators and I was not entirely sure how to go about suggesting this. In any case, my one recommendation is that they should add books to the list available on Kindle which show up on required reading lists for colleges. I am a college student and I pay $60 on average for many books that are required for me to read in order to pass my classes. College is already very expensive and the prices of the books once you have paid tuition are very high. If these books were available on Kindle, it would suddenly appeal to a different generation than it currently targets. This would increase profits and would make college students every where very happy too."
5,Great Item - Highly Recommend,"I originally bought the Kindle for my wife, but now we find ourselves fighting over whose going to use this thing. We absolutely love how this device is so portable, the battery lasts a very long time, and it can store so many books. With the 3g connectivity, downloading additional books is a breeze and on Amazon they're pretty cheap. Most new books only cost $9.95. Since this is the only eReader I've had, I can't really compar eit to other products like Sony's eReader, but we have not been disappointed in the least by the reader or by the availability of books from Amazon."
2,I returned it unopened after I came to my senses,"Bought this product -- agonized over the cost of it for 10 days, then returned it unopened--too expensive and then I realized how expensive the books, newspapers, etc. would be costing---the concept is great but price needs to come down before I would consider purchasing this product again--and I had a $50. coupon from Oprah!! not at this time---I originally wanted the Kindle for my husband who is visually sight impaired --but no local area news papers were offered either."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoy reading in bed at night with the lights out so it doesn't affect my partner. I've been using those annoying mini-lights that don't give proper lighting for me to enjoy reading. I'm disappointed that the kindle doesn't have their screen illuminating choice for night readers. When you do I will purchase your product. Until then, sorry, no sale."
2,TOO EXPENSIVE!!,I watched as several hundred of these were given away on television. Seems if they can do that then the price can also be lower. Way too expensive only to pay again for the books. Looks like a neat product though!
2,So so,"Its under preforming for a 300$ device in comparison a Netbook is much more feature rich and is not limited in text to speech options.Its not a bad device but you are paying 170$ for a brand name alone.A warning to blind or sight disabled persons this device is setup to allow text to speech only on Ebooks that allow it, the suits don't want to lose Ebook sells from this device...."
2,"NO Light, No Pictures","I love everything about the Kindle, EXCEPT..NO LIGHT and No PICTURES. I read alot of true crime and it is hard to get to know the characters and the crime seen without pictures. In fact, no pictures is the worse. I would not have bought it if I had known no pictures are downloaded."
5,Best Gift Ever,This was bought as a gift for my daughter who loves to read. She had it for only 5 minutes and bought her first book and hasn't put it down since! She says she reads more books because she can read faster on the Kindle. Plus she found all kinds of free books through Amazon which she has taken advantage of. This was the best investment!
1,Good concept...Bad EULA,"After the '1984' incident, I will surely not recommend this item. Should policies change in the future, then maybe. Until then, stay away!"
2,Love/Hate Relationship,"Great changes to the original but I'm still extremely concerned about the many battery problems encounted by pwners. With the new non-user re[laceable battery will early battery failures be covered under warranty (weren't for the original)? What kind of turn-around will be provided (the wait for replacements for the original frequently has exceeded 4 months)? Will Kindle 1 owners be ""orphaned""?"
1,Too Expensive,"As a person who values both the ""feel"" of a book and the ""green"" of a Kindle concept I am hard pressed to justify the expense of $359 for a want vs a need. A book has a certain comfort that is sadly missing with a sterile black and white only convenience toy. I would like to clearly understand from anyone the real value of a convenience device vs the comfort of a book in hand that is recyclable multiple times.(Please, not a weak save the trees argument). Thanks"
3,Waiting,"I've never owned a Kindle but would love to! I refuse to purchase one, however until1) The price comes down (if they're going to come up with a new model every year, you'd think they'd make it at least affordable enough to purchase a new one every year!) It also makes me nervous that if I buy one now, it will break down or be utterly useless in 5 years!2) As a world traveller, I absolutely refuse to buy a Kindle until I can download books anywhere in the world!!"
2,Nice try still no cigar,This appears to be a big improvement and believe me I have been waiting for this to come out and it is ALMOST there:Still need to improve priceWhat is with this 10 cents a down load. The phone company stopped charging by the call long ago. This looks like a trap.Need to improve the compatability to work with all systemsReduce the border increase the screenColor - I still have my green screen monitor but I haven't turned it on in a while.
5,amazon kindle,"I hesitated to buy a Kindle until now, being a paper-lover. But I really love the product. The downloads are almost instantaneous and there are so many free classics to choose from. The reading is easy and comfortable and it fits perfectly into a purse for travel."
1,I want books to be mine,"I like the idea of having a library at your fingertips. The display of Kindle is great. The usage with better scrolling and searching is getting better with the 2nd generation.Reasons to buy, right?But beware, Amazon can use the kill-switch anytime and did so already. So you are in the hands of the publishing companies and Amazon.What is worth a library if the books in it can be stolen anytime?"
3,2.5 Stars - Keeping K1 & returning K2,"Too few things better; too many things worse. The final ""deal-breakers"" for me were the ""ghosting"" of the previous image, the ridiculously difficult way of turning it off (slide and hold for a few seconds vs. just switch it off), ill-placed and ill-sized page-turn buttons, visually ""cluttered"" page-turns (you see both pages for a split second instead of just a momentarily blank screen) and, finally - the real killer - a seemingly much dimmer and less contrasted screen (very hard to read vs. K1).Add the items above to the fact that some of the changes seem to be just for the sake of change vs. any real logic behind them and I'll save my $ for K3!!"
1,I Hate It,"Wow, why buy this when your library is just 10 minutes away. Does this have all books for free? No. Does the library?Yes. You have to pay for all the books. And the very few ones that are free? They are horrible. If the books were free, I would but it. No, they are not free, and the device itself is more than $100. Why buy this dumb thing?"
3,No page numbers,"I have wanted a Kindle for as long as they have been on the market. When the price dropped a month or so ago I ordered one right away. I already had a Sony ereader and was pretty pleased with it but the remote ordering capability led me to buy the Kindle. It is a really nice device but the location numbers at the bottom of the screen just about drives me insane. I have no desire to read the book because I don't know where I'm at in it. The percentage number is alright but I'm old fashioned and I like my page numbers. The Sony's screen is also clearer and it has the page numbers at the bottom of the screen. If I could return it I would that is how disappointed in the device not having page numbers. But, I guess I will have to get used to it. My dream turned into an ALMOST nightmare."
2,I was disappointed,"I was very excited when I bought the Kindle, it was an e-reader I wanted to buy for a long time.But ... when I received the Kindle and thought I could buy a lot of cheap e-books I was very very disappointed. Why? Because as a non-US citizen I have to pay a much higher price for e-books than Americans!!! Why didn't Amazon warn me beforehand about this???? I could have bought a European e-reader and would still have to buy higher priced e-books. For that I don't need the Kindle.Shame on you Amazon. So non-US citizens, don't make the same mistake I made."
2,kindle review,"Likes: readabiliyfast downloadsdislikes:-no customer service to call or email if there are questions or problems. There is asubstanitial amount of service to take your order, but no one seems to care whathappens after you have bought it.- your extended warranty was presented without saying upfront what it would cost.- battery life not substantial..after two days of reading it needs to be recharged-would like a back lite so you could read in an area that is not well lighted-waiting 5 sec to turn off system is too long...have on off switch"
3,Technical Ninny reviews:,"As a non-technically adept person, I have found this device pleasant enough to use in a simple fashion. I don't know how to use its more sophisticated features and I'm not particularly interested in learning them."
4,B-day Kindle,"I got the Kindle for my husband's bday. He really likes it, but after charging the battery, we start having a few problems trying to register the e-reader.He hasn't download any ebook yet (Kindle doesn't allow him) so we'll have to call the cs for more instructions.The manual book including in the Kindle, just tell you how to buy an ebook from Amazon, not how to use the Kindle, etc."
5,Best thing EVER,"I have always liked to read, so when Amazon came out with the Kindle I was drooling. I don't buy the first version of anything so I waited patiently for the 2nd one to come out and it was worth the wait. Compared to my cousin's first edition, mine is sleek and a bit easier to use. It's perfect for standing on the bus because I only need one hand. For this convenience and for the reason that I want something super slim for my already overstuffed purse, I purposely avoided Kindle covers that make it seem like you are using a traditional book and opted instead for the cheaper Octovo cover, which I highly recommend. All in all, I read even more now that I have it."
5,good book - difficult adapter,I love the Kindle - it's just perfect while I am travelling and very ok at home.The adapter for the electric power supply is a pain if you live in Switzerland. Our plugs are very different from the us-type. I tried the iPod adapter - same out-put (5V - 1 Amp) but it does not work. Any bright ideas???
5,El Kindle me tiene frustrado,"Soy cliente de amazon desde hace algun tiempo y siempre han cumplido cos sus ofertas publicitarias, pase navidades en Wodinville cerca de Redmon donde estan las oficinas de Microsoft con mi hija su esposo y los nietos, recibi el Kindle de 6 pulgadas como un regalo por las festividades de la navidad. El entusiamo me duro poco, pues no funciona el sistema inalambrico ni el que esta ligado al 3G, es decir la conectividad base del equipo no existe, prové en mi pueblo Portoviejo, ECUADOR y despues en una ciudad grande como Guayaquil, pero el resultado fue el mismo. Esto me tiene frustrado pues las mejores caracteristicas del libro digital no funcionan como lo dice la propoganda de Amazon. Angel Loor Giler"
1,On this day and age?,"We can watch full collor movies on smaller hand held devices for a lower price. It is a shame that there is not color on this 2 generation Kindle. Perhaps they rushed too much on getting it to the market, but I think that the lack of color especially at that price is a ""WAIT TILL NEXT GENERATION ARRIVES"" kind of deal."
1,Poor customer service,"I have been an Amazon.com customer for years and they have always had outstanding customer service. But to my surprise with the kindle they really messed it up.I am frequent international traveler, not living in the US but visiting the country almost every month on business trips. I was very anxious to get a Kindle and be able to travel with many books in one. I got my kindle yesterday and to my surprise I am not allowed to buy books for the kindle using my credit card because the billing address is not in the US. But they did accept the same billing address to pay for the Kindle!!!"
2,Waiting for Kindle 3 - I hope,"The Deal Breaker for me with Kindle 2 is that on the one hand, Amazon removed the SD card from Kindle 2. And, on the other hand, they did not create a Kindle system that permits organizing all your Kindle titles into folders.I use the SD cards to store titles I've read and want to keep as a way of keeping my Kindle 1 (which I do still love) clear of clutter. Once read, I move the title from the Kindle memory to the SD card. Then I take the SD card out. Hey, presto! A cleaned-up Home page is mine!So, no SD card + no folders = no sale to me.Folders. That's what the reading world is waiting for, Kindle developers. Folders."
3,LOVE My Kindle - Hate that the Screen Broke!!!,"So, I received my kindle about two years ago as a gift. At first I wasn't sure I would like it (I'm one of those bibliophiles who LOVES books, the cover art work or just the binding, the feel of them, the transportability and reliability). I was surprised to find that I quickly grew accustomed to the Kindle and grew to LOVE it, because of the immediate access to literature and all the other fun things you can do on it. Alas, our love affair did not last long... because the flashly Kindle was just not reliable. Out of the blue (I did not drop it, or mistreat) the screen became filled with horizontal lines and would not activate. I had used it the night before with no problem... the next day it was dead. And, of course it was out of warranty. So, now I miss my Kindle and have reverted to my trusty paper editions. I'm on the fence about replacing the Kindle. I don't want to purchase another one without any reassurance that the screens are more durable."
5,Simple,"I'm a hi-tech geek kind of guy, so this thing didn't exactly phase me from the get-go, but I wanted it for reading books, and that's what it was made for! Battery life lasts for eons (probably a month or more), and 3G capability is nice! Bought one for my mom, and only problem she's run into is checking out books from the digital library because it doesn't have wi-fi capabilities. Disappointing! You can't blame the technology for advancing into new things and leaving older products in the dust, though. Overall, a great product!"
3,Generation 2 E-Reader,When i try to type in a passage of the bible to go to it freeze an won't move. I also find it annoying to try and find certain things I am a bible reader an trying to get to books of the bible an passages you have to go through too many steps. It should be a easier way to get from point A to B. Also I did not receive a booklet that would be more helpful when I'm trying to figure out how to do different things. I would have loved to received a hard copy of directions and insturctions with my E-Reader when I received it.
4,3rd Kindle,"This is my 3rd Kindle in a year and a half. The 1st 2 (1st generation Kindle) were accidently dropped and broke instantly. Since I do like the Kindle alot (can't do without it) I bought this one. It is thinner and some of the new features are great. No more accidently turned pages! But I do not like the on/off switch. Always have a problem turning it off, takes several tries. The battery does last longer...but no memory card. It's a great tool, and thank Goodness for the insurance!!!!"
4,Kinday Wireless Reading Device,"easy and quick downloads...at the time I purchased it, the global was more so I elected not to buy it...would suggest the global for those that travel for work or vacation. Otherwise, it works!"
4,Enjoying my Kindle 2,"I purchased my Kindle 2 about a month ago, and enjoy it very much. Did a lot of research on book readers before purchasing. When I first received it I was worried about dropping it. (Wish it came with some kind of cover) I have purchased a leather cover since then that I also enjoy. No more paperback or hardcover books laying around my house now."
5,love it!!!,"Love my Kindle! easy to read, travels easily. Only suggestion would be touch screen to move around more easily."
5,My Kindle,"I just love my Kindle. It is very easy reading and using the many features. I like the ease of shopping at the Kindle store right from the Kindle and the reasonable cost of the books. I enjoy the feature of the Kindle reading to me while I am working around the house, etc."
4,Happy but not ecstatic.,"Difficult to find where one was formerly reading.Would like to be able to read two or more books at the same time {alternately}Minor, but would be nice if battery lasted longer."
1,kindle,"I was very happy to receive my Kindle bought on the french site of AMAZON, when I discovered that only english language books could be loaded ! this frustrated me enormously. I consider as unacceptable that a product could be promoted on a french AMAZON site, when it is only usable for english speaking customers.I returned the Kindle, I am still waiting for the refund, but it costed me all shipping and return fees, about 70 euros in total which are not refunded.As you can imagine, I am not happy at all after this experience."
1,KIndle Wireless for Australia,"So I went online to buy the product prior to Xmas, I purchased it (I thought), Amazon gave me delivery details, I tracked it for a while, always hoping to get it before Xmas. Then inexplicably the order was cancelled, the Kindle was refunded to my account, no explanation why it was cancelled or if they were reordering, nothing. ANd then I get a barage of emails about electronic books I can buy for the Kindle I can't seem to buy!!!!! I bought an adapter which is sitting on my desk as I write for the Kindle I don't own!!!! Just love the product, would like another one in fact! If Amazon ever get their act together maybe one day I'll actually own one and then I will happily review it!Oh and by the way, I did send emails to the customer service dept where I got equally ridiculous replies from, oh and was the customer service up to scratch reviews...."
2,kindle- download a book from home- NOT,"before purchasing a kindle please,please,please check the area coverage map and then please dont beleive it. i do not live in a cave nor do i live deep in the woods nor do i live in a valley i CAN NOT down load a book in my home the customer service agents i have called told me to go to town to down load a book. the next level of support the whispernet experts have taken much information but still NO COVERAGE TO MY HOME. so check the competition first. not a happy customer...yvonne"
2,Prices of books up 50%??!!,"I am very concerned after reading that major publishers are pulling the plug on electronic book versions at amazon, and will no longer honor the $9.99 price for bestsellers. Apparently, the prices will increase to somewhere around $15.99 from what I have read. Thus, purchasing a book at that price dramatically reduces the savings (or may even result in paying more than you can purchase a current title at Costco and elsewhere) from hardcover prices. It would take a great many purchases at $15.99 to realize the payback on the inital cost of buying a new kindle (I have a secondhand one). Too, bad if you purchased without knowing of the book price increases."
2,KINDLE,"IT WAS OK BUT NOT EASY TO READ IN SUN LIGHT AND IT DOE,S NOT GIVE ALL THE NEWS PAPER IT IS NOT LIKE READING A PAPER IN YOUR HANDS"
1,defective by design,"When you buy something, but the original creator can take it away from you whenever he/she so pleases, then do you ever own anything?In George Orwell's book ""1984"" (which was removed from Kindles worldwide by Amazon itself), the government was constantly re-writing history, and even basic math (2+2=5). It would re-write the textbooks and destroy the old ones with the forbidden information. Now it's that much easier. Amazon can remove the books you buy, without explanation.Imagine how easy it would have been for Hitler had he been able to simply press ""delete"" and whole sections of literature had disappeared? Kindle is basically a very efficient book-burner."
1,The Great Kindle Swindle,"The Kindle, otherwise known as the Trojan Horse of ebooks. If you buy this, just be aware that you are paying for content you will never own, cannot control, and which Amazon can take back from you at ANY time without asking your permission. With this device and DRM they do not have to burn books anymore - why waste matches and paper when they can just erase it in a flash? Better still, change the content so that you only get to read what they want you to read. Like the idea? Then you will make a good Little Brother or Sister to Big Brother."
4,Kindles are great for traveling!,"I bought my kindle because I'm kind of tough on books. I was also going on vacation and I wanted something that I could use to get books even if I wasn't near a book store. This is the perfect item! Not only can you download anywhere (well in areas where there is coverage, which is most places) but you save 60 to 75% on most books. I'm very pleased with this purchased and I look forward to the ever increasing choises that I'm given."
5,Great invention for busy moms!,Love the kindle. Easily fits into a handbag so you have it handy when sitting in dentist/doctor office witing for appointments. Love that you can get a book in 60 seconds or less!
5,GH Kindle review,"Kindle DX Wireless Reading Device (9.7"" Display, U.S. Wireless, Latest Generation)An excellent device for book reading only spoiled by the difficulty in obtaining books outside of the USA.Not very clear in any of the descriptions that books are actually specially abridged for the Kindle.Does not seem correct to pay full book price for a half length book especially when the cost of downloading in our immediate area is at no cost to Amazon.It actually took me half an hour on the phone to an Amazon advisor to eventually download one single book. Surely there must be an easier way to do it in areas not covered by the ""whispernet""Overall, very pleased with the Kindle itself.Very disapointed in the complexity getting a book from Amazon to the Kindle, whick should have been a very simple process.George H.GrantCyprus"
2,Kindle Impressions,"The Kindle's technology is fine, although a larger screen and higher contrast would be nice. But the book offer - in Europe - is really disappointing.The large majority of the books that interest me are available in the US only. I understand it's a copyright issue, but if Amazon can sell me a printed copy from the US, why not a digital one?I cannot even use it as a web reader, as all sites except Wikipedia are blocked.Unless these issues are solved, the Kindle remains a nice gadget, not really value for money."
2,Plain text and lack of choice,"I bought the Kindle for use in Ireland. I have been very disappointed with the selection of books, magazines and newspapers. Most content is not available in Europe or at least in Ireland. Any book I wanted to purchase has not been available for the Kindle. I tried the PDF conversion service and that appears to dump all the images and deliver a plain text file, not much use for magazines."
2,Using Kindle overseas,"The Kindle website says, ""If you are out of wireless coverage, such as traveling overseas, you can download books to your PC or Mac and transfer via USB to your Kindle."" There are no instructions for this, however, neither on the website nor in the Kindle User's Guide.I emailed Customer Service, only to get a reply saying that I must phone them--from abroad, at my own expense. DON'T BUY A KINDLE if you do a lot of foreign travel!Richard Hornby"
3,"Works ok, but no backlight","I purchased this Kindle for my husband because he loves to read, it looks great, sleek, and easy to use. The only issue I have is that there is no back light,we love to read in bed but don't like to have the light on in the room. Would be nice to have that feature. The downloads are fast and easy, but the prices of the books are too high. It's less expensive to buy at barnes and noble."
4,Bummed out,"I love my Kindle. It's so nice to read a book without my hands cramping up holding it. The reason I'm bummed out is because the day after I ordered my Kindle online for $259, they went on sale for $189. I feel like a total schmuck. I actually had ordered one for my husband and one for me so I feel totally rooked.Other than that, the Kindle is great and I really like it. The only thing that's kind of glitchy is when you're trying to find an author or a specific book, the connection takes you to some really strange places and not to the actual author or book."
3,Customs difficulties!,"I live in Taiwan and was excited to finally be able to get a Kindle International. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten it yet. It arrived in the country in 2 days, but UPS says it will take well over a week to clear this new technology through customs, and I had to submit all kinds of paperwork to them, including power of attorney papers if you can believe it, just to get the proces rolling. Be aware there may be significant hurdles to importing your Kindle!"
2,Kindle Edition Costs Undermine The Value,"I was excited when I first got a Kindle for a present, but, except for taking up less space, especially while traveling, and saving trees, I cannot imagine why anyone would buy a Kindle edition for just a few dollars less than the real book new from Amazon or for more than the cost of a used book from Amazon. When you are finished with a hardback book, you can pass it on to a friend. Not so with the Kindle editions. The line of distribution has so many economies with the Kindle (no printing a big inventory, no paper to stock, no gluing, no levels of distribution) but the price savings is too small to justify especially since you give up the right to resell or to give the book away. Someone is being too greedy. Why should we cooperate?"
2,Dissatisfied,"Funny that I receive this automated request for a review the day after our Kindle acts up. Have had for less than a month and yesterday the screen is not functioning. The LCD is all jumbled and recharging did not help with the problem. So, I guess I will be contacting Amazon about warranty information this evening. Very happy with the product while it was working. Should not be having warranty issues less than a month into the purchase."
1,Will Never Buy From Amazon Again,"I am glad that I now know that Amazon can steal books right off your Kindle, I was thinking seriously of buying one.Now that I am aware of amazon's ability, I will never buy a Kindle from amazon, nor will I ever buy anything from amazon ever again. B&N;, along with Borders will be getting my business from now on.Amazon is in over their heads with the Kindle.They have lost a long-time customer with this screw up."
1,Won't be buying a Kindle,"Now that I know that Amazon can and is willing to break into customers' Kindles and change the content without prior consent, I absolutely will not buy this product!"
5,I love my Kindle!,"I'm from Germany and I like to read books in English. With the help of my Kindle I can have them immediately. I also can download a sample and test read a little before I buy, even though some samples are too short and taken up mainly by some preface.Downloading books in Berlin works very well and every book is available within seconds.I run out of space for new books anyway, now I have one book that can encompass a whole library without taking up a lot of space and which I can also take with me everywhere.When I read in my kindle, sometimes I even forget that it is an e-book and I try to turn the pages.I only hope that eventually German books will be available as well."
4,I love my Kindle!,"I love my Kindle! I think the e-ink screen is great. It's much better than carrying a stack of books, and I also like that you can read it outside in the wind without the pages blowing everywhere! I would definitely recommend it to people who like to read on the go.The only real problem I have found is that there is no way to browse books by anything other than title, author, or recently opened. I would love to be able to organise by fiction or non-fiction, by genre or subject, and by publication date. I would give it 5 stars if Amazon released a software update for this."
5,very pleased,"I was one of the reticent readers who claimed that I liked to hold the actual book in my hand and couldn't imagine doing otherwise. I was so wrong. The Kindle is a wonder. When reading, it is like reading an actual physical book, but without the weight, without even having to hold a book open. I am thrilled with how it works. I tried it outdoors yesterday in brilliant sunshine and was amazed at how bright and clear it was. I have a lot to learn about all of its functions, but for the month that I have owned it, I have loved it and take it with me almost everywhere. It is cool to be able to download a book in one minute..and from wherever you happen to be.I did buy a case for it-the M-edge one with the zipper and feel it keeps the kindle very secure. Now am debating about a light and if so, which one is best For now, I am just enjoying it...and highly recommend it to all readers."
5,Great product,I really enjoy my kindle. I like large to read with large fonts so I have found the Kindle really useful and comfortable to read. Besides it is easier to carry than a bunch of books especially for long distance travel.
1,Parents beware of the kindle,My 12 year old got a kindle for Christmas. I thought it would be great until I realized it has a internet search engine which means access to the web 24/7 and there is no way to password protect this. None! This is so bad because when I found out I could not even return the device as it had been bought through a store and needed to be brought back Christmas day. I am extremely disappointed with Amazon over this issue. I have tried to sort this out many times and so for I have got NOWHERE. This expensive gift is sitting collecting dust because of lack of foresight by the designers. If it had internet protection it would be used and enjoyed.
5,A Brilliant Product,"The Kindle is a brilliant way to have a book to hand at all times. No excuse owing to weight, as so light able to have in handbag or briefcase at all times. To be able to enlarge the font size is marvelous, linked to speech enabling it makes it an ideal gift for sight impaired or older people. The amazing thing i believe is that aged parents who are not computer literate are also able to download reading material as the Kindle is the complete package. The fact that it works when it first comes out of the packaging is a major plus no downloading software etc.As you can tell I am absolutely hooked on my Kindle and am recommending to everyone.Pamela S"
4,love my kindle,I am very please with my Kindle for now. I have only one thing that I am not happy with. Tell me when will we be able to share or borrow books from other Kindle users like the Barnes and Noble 'Nook'?
5,Surprises from Kindle,"Before purchase, I found it difficult to believe that Amazon's U.K. Kindle could fulfil all that it promised. Wireless delivery of large books in seconds? Easy to read & use? Light, portable yet reliable?I'm pleased to say that all that it promises is delivered. Books etc are downloaded seamlessly & in seconds. So far, it's proven easy to use [the adjustable font size is a boon as is its ability to pick up on the page where I stopped obviating the need for endless scrolling], battery life is good, it's easy and intuitive to use, and easy to pack in bags, cars etc so is genuinely portable.Impressive. I doubt I'll buy a book again."
3,shopping for a book consumes more time than you think,"Amazon does not categorize Kindle books as fiction or nonfiction. I waste a lot of time trying to determine which the book is. I have complained about this to customer service with no relief. Customer reviews are often misleading and inaccurately refer to nonfiction as a ""novel""."
3,"Kindle is nice, but won't replace real newspapers / magizines","just got my Kindle in Oct 09 (I've wanted one,the price just dropped to $259 )...I mostly read coffee table-large books ( I like the pictures that go with an educational text)....so I am using my Kindle for papers/magizines..love the fast delivery to the device,good subscription prices,very long battery life...no way to scan the headlines to stories-you have to go thru them one at a time, pictures/ graphs in the stories do not get well represented on the kindle...Kindles metel backplate is always cold to the touch-maybe that should be made of plastic or rubber coated"
3,Kindle 2,"Was disappointed that a few weeks after my purchase, the US Version was discontinued and the international version replaced it at the same price. I feel I was purchasing inventory clearance at the list price."
4,"mine works great on sprint network, AT&T sucks","I love my Kindle. I have vision problems and haven't been able to read comfortably for many years. Plus I don't have to carry heavy books around or find a place to store them and I can have my new reading material instantly. However, I ordered my husband one for Christmas. His came in on AT&T network. Absolutely NO coverage in the town we live in. Boxed it up and sent it back. Very unhappy about that. Still loving mine but wish he could have one too."
5,Kindle Wireless Reading Device,"I absolutely love this product. I set it up in less than 15 minutes. I spend most of my day in my car and I just click the audio book and it reads the book for me and I can listen while I drive. I love this. I also love the built in dictionary because I always look up words I am not familar with while I'm reading. My husband doesn't like to fly, so we drive everywhere to go on vacation, so he drives and I read and now I don't have to lug around alot of books, I just take my Kindle. Its been a life saver for me. Don't know how I ever lived without it."
4,Disappointed,"I am enjoying my 2nd Generation Kindle which I received in the mail about three weeks ago. My only concerns are that the contrast is not as good as I expected it to be and there is more glare than I anticipated.I was very unhappy to open an email from Amazon this evening and find out there is already a newer version out and I only purchased my Kindle a few weeks ago. The new version promises to be lighter, faster, 50% better contrast and holds more than twice as many books as my version. Besides that, it is selling for $50 less than the older version.I don't understand why I had to pay more for a product that is obviously inferior to the newer version. Now, I am very disappointed in Amazon and Kindle."
3,Cheated,"The product is good. But I felt cheated by Amazon. The new version is out only one month after I purchased my Kindle at the same cost. If I knew the new and better is out soon, I would definitely wait for the new version.Although what you have done is totally legal but I felt disappointed by the way Amazon selling me obsoleted product.Definitely will choose other vendor instead of Amazon next time when I consider buying a new ebook reader."
2,Items was broken,"The seller claim that the items was in good condition but never mention the most important part was broken, the scrolling knob was split in half. talk about false advertisement!"
4,e-Ink is great for reading. Kindle QA is lacking,"The Kindle made a great first impression. Clean lines, nice design, easy to read. A few weeks after owning it, dead lines started appearing in the mid part of the screen. No amount of refreshing cleared it up. Looks like an electrical failure in the controller that draws the screen. I wish the design were more robust."
3,"Kindle 6"" is a bit too small but otherwise--Fantastic","I actually loved the Kindle but as I said above, the space provided for reading was too small for me and I felt as if I were missing text even though I was not. I plan to get the larger Kindle (the 9 1/2"" ) soon . I do very much like the idea and the convenience of the Kindle. Beside the fact that is is an ecological treat inasmuch as it saves paper and therefore, trees.Thank you for giving me the opportunity to write this review. I would like folks to know that it is a good idea and an excellent product.I think the fact that I feel the way I do about the smaller Kindle is that I am elderly, and need the font to be quite large this making thereading space seem less. However, I do recommend the Kindle overall.Thank you Amazon for presenting it."
4,Love it!,"The only improvement would be to include the book's illustrations. I love the Amazon link and the rapid downloads. The free service to convert my docs, etc, worked almost instantly and flawlessly. Marvelous product!"
1,No wireless access from here!,"This kindle is a huge disappointment! I had no idea that I lived outside the wireless area. All books have to be downloaded via my computer and the process is too complex for me. Also...with help..I got one book downloaded and in the middle of reading it it ended up archived. I have tried several times to retrieve it with no success. Kindle help had me on hold for over 30 minutes. For $300. I could buy a lot of real books, have them to share with others, and easily buy them on line. I feel that amazon should have informed me that I was not in a wireless area before they made it so easy to purchase the kindle."
1,I want information,"I have been writting since you published the Kindle International. I live in Mexico City and for ever I have wanted something so practical.I wrote asking where the Kindle was made, it is very important for importation purposes, because if it is made in China we pay a lot of taxes...and I mean around twice the cost of the Kindle or more.Then I asked, why can`t you also make available the Kindle DX?That would really be having a choice.I hope I can get an answer this time. Thank you very much. Maria"
2,"only the books, please","while the kindle looks like a decent product, i don't want it. i want a different e-book reader. BUT, i want to buy my books from amazon. but amazon won't let anyone buy the books without owning a kindle or iphone. that's pure crap. amazon, sell the books in a format that everyone can use. i don't want to be tied to your device! give me only the books, please!"
3,check it out first,"I got my Kindle2 last week. Physicaly it is represented accurately, and it was easy and fun to use. BUT I ordered the first book without caring about the price ($14.xx) and I got a subscription to IBD (2 weeks free yea). Then I wanted to get some more books to have on hand for some diversity. Now I wanted to keep an eye on price. It is very hard to find any books I want to read that aren't more than the price of the book in a store. ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" is an old '70's book I had an interest in because of ""BladeRunner"" the movie being based on it. It was fourteen bucks to download! Get REAL Amazon this feels like bait and switch to me now, and my kindle2 has lost it's lustre in just one week. What an expensive lesson."
1,WARNING the K2 no longer has text to voice feature!!!!,"I got my tax refund all ready to buy and notice, by reviews only, that the text to voice feature has been removed?!!! Last I heard about this, Amazon was holding ground that any infrindgment was groundless since the Kindle does not actually store the audio formats of the books, it only verbalizes the text during the reading mode...? Amazon! you should've held your ground. This was THE selling point feature for me...I was willing to put up with monochrome reading for the voice feature... Now you lose, and I expect unless you change the K2 description with a huge ""warning... K2 is now no longer equipt with the feature you are buying it for"" you will be getting many returns and alot more unhappy campers...I have always felt trusting of Amazon to give us the best... shame on me."
1,Beware of Big Brother,"In the past couple of days, Amazon has demonstrated that they not only have but are willing to use their ability to reach into your Kindle and delete things that you have already purchased and downloaded. While their reason this time is because of copyright violations, imagine what a terrible precedent this sets for the future, when corporations can selectively choose what you can or cannot read, even after you purchase the book. Send a message to Amazon that this practice cannot be tolerated by not purchasing the Kindle until these intrusive DRM problems are fixed."
1,no repair service post 1 year,"Yes, I liked my Kindle and purchased many books. But mysteriously, my Kindle 2 screen developed a shaded area at the top of the display screen. Of course this happened at 14 months after purchase. But it didn't seem like a huge issue and I just assumed I'b be able to send it in and get it repaired. When I called Amazon Kindle Customer Service I found out that not only was their no repair service. I inquired about some possible ways to trouble shoot the screen issue and was told there was NO WAY to fix it. And finally there was no credit for replacing my Kindle or even an offer for a discount on a new one. Just toss it in the trash. I am rethinking my enthusiasm for this product and for it's promoter Amazon..."
4,Kindle rocks but needs a tweak,I love my new Kindle. I enjoy reading more and love saving the space. Joining blogs and magazines is great. Only 2 downsides. 1) I cant really share a book with someone like I currently might with a paperbook. 2) this needs a backlight. I know it would use more battery and that you can buy a cheap one but this is crucial to read in the dark when needed. Color wouldn't hurt for magazines. Kindle need respond quick as the war is coming with the other readers.
3,Kindle too fragile,"I bought a Kindle a couple of months ago and I like using it but I have had two of them break down while traveling. Both times, Amazon replaced it with out an issue but I am worried that I will need to treat this so carefully. Both times, the Kindle was in a padded pouch and after a few days of travel, the screen looked like an ink splatter and nothing worked. All I can guess is that some thing pressed against the screen but can't see how since my lap top sits in an adjacent padded pouch and I have never had an issue. I now regret getting such a flimsy device that I can't travel with, with out worrying when and how it will break next."
3,It has quality problems,"I am giving a three-star rating to Amazon for its excellent return policy. As for the Kindle device itself, it stopped refreshing the full page after a few minutes of use. Now only the lower half of the page can be refreshed and the top half of the page remains static (showing the screen saver).The next comment concerns the web browser. More development work needs to be done by Amazon on this ""Experimental"" utility. Most of the time the links would lead to an error message. It is very frustrating. Since I own also the Kindle DX, my comment is not restricted to just the Kindle 2, although the problem is worse because the right half of some webpages are beyond the the small screen and cannot be accessed through the joy-stick. Using the larger DX screen I can see the full page by rotating it to landscape mode. But many of the links still do not work."
5,Scan your Kindle 2!!,"Got it yesterday and I'm loving it for a lot of reasons stated in other reviews. But here is one I didn't find.The screen technology is slick and creates electronic ""ink on paper"". It can be photocopied. Then I thot... hmm...I put the Kindle 2 on smallest type face and then scanned it with text recognition software. It misspelled only one word!! I do a lot of quoting and this scans better than a book (with the spine bend.)Not in itself a reason to buy, just an added one."
4,I feel like I was Dup!!!!,"I feel Like I was ripped off...First let me say I do enjoy my Kindle..My son wanted to buy me one for my birthday, he saved his money since he is a student.. I have had this kindle for about a month...Thought it was a good deal now I see that they have a newer model for $139.00, & it has more storage ...I'm sure that you guys was aware that a newer version was coming along...Now I see that the options for the newer version is in Graphite color,more storage & the buttons look great for less dollars..Wow what a joke!!! Amazon is starting to be like everybody else there should be some way that you could upgrade...I'm just a little disappointed in Amazon...I guess you guys have capitalize just like the other guys!!!"
4,The kindle is great with one exception,"I have very much enjoyed the kindle, I find that I am reading a wider variety of books. It is easy to read, portable and convenient. The one drawback I find is the use of the text to speech. The male voice is fine, with a few mispronunciations. The female voice has many mispronunciations and the reading is stilted and odd. The breathing points in a sentence are broken at odd moments, the intonation is strange."
3,kindle review,"Hello everyone who may read this. First of all I must say that the Kindle works very well, is easy to read from and performs as advertised. Here are my beefs and I hope for Amazon's sake they change things. ITS TOO PROPRIETORY. THE BOOKS COST ABOUT 2 DOLLARS MORE ON AMAZON THAN ALOT OF OTHER SITES. YOU HAVE ALOT MORE CHOICES IF YOU CAN DOWNLOAD E PUB. IT DOESN'T HAVE AN SD CARD SLOT. If being able to download without a computer is a priority then get the Kindle. If not then I suggest something that accepts more formats. In the end this it what it's all about......CHOICE & COST. In the end as more of these readers come out and more sites offer E Pub as the format of choice I can see the KIndle going the way of the BETA tape player. I would hope Amazon has more foresight than they are displaying right now. I also have a Sony e reader and can download books from many sites and public libraries. Can you do this on a Kindle?...NO WAY! BIG MISTAKE."
4,How much do I love my Kindle?,"The Kindle is just about the best thing I own. I am definitely reading more and as I travel frequently it is just so convenient.My only comment is that living in Australia, the only way I seem to be able to charge it is through my computer which is not very convenient when you are travelling! A friend has a similar experience - we find it just does not want to charge through the power point!"
4,Super Gift,I received this as a birthday gift from my husband. LOVE IT! It is so easy to navigate around the menu and being able to change the font allows me to read without my glasses (added bonus). So exciting to know I have thousands of books at my fingertips.
5,Everything and more,I've followed this product for 3 years before buying one and its everything I had hoped for. Easy to use...easy to read and more enjoyable reading since I can bump-up the font size.
5,I can't belive how I lived without it!!!,"I purchased the Kindle 2 about a month ago. I had been thinking about it for awhile and finally just broke down and bought it. It was money well invested. The books download VERY quick. The screen is very easy to read, with many different font sizes. There is also the option to space the words close or further away from each other making this a great gift for anyone. There are next page buttons on each side making this very easy to use with one hand....right or left. I have noticed my mom eyeing mine so guess what she's getting for Christmas??? I have nothing but good things to say about the Kindle 2."
5,What did I do before the Knidle 2?,"I will be honest, I had no idea as to what a Kindle was 6 months ago. My husband was in an accident and in the hospital when on of our friends said ""Wow you have a lot of books in your bag for the stay why don't you just get a Kindle?"" So I told her I had no idea what she was talking about and she proceeded to explain how her friend and father had one and they could not live without it. So as soon as my husband was out of the hospital I researched it and could not believe I had never heard of a Kindle. I ordered one 2 weeks later after a slight internal debate and now it is my best friend. It is easy to use, way easier to carry than all the books I used to carry and extremely addictive. I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!! I think that it is such a great investment that I am considering getting my 13 year old one for christmas because he reads so much. Buy one you will not regret it but be prepared to fall in love!!!!!!!!!!!Shelley"
5,I fear my Kindle,"I am afraid of my Kindle. The reason? I am afraid I will go broke from buying books. I have had my Kindle for roughly a month now, and I have already spent almost as much again on books. It's just way too easy and pleasurable to read; to sample a book; to take the plunge and buy it devouring it until the last line.All in all I have read as much during the last month as during the entire previous year. And that is to me the single best proof of the genius of the Kindle."
4,Kindle Internation - (Brazilian user),I am using my kindle for three weeks now. I liked it very much and the wireless network was a good surprise since it was possible to use it in remote areas and smaller cities.The lack of open internet access in Brazil realy sucks. Maybe Amazon could ofer a paid soluction to this.We need more magazines and newspapers with brazilian content availble.Alexandre Pires
5,Best Book I've Ever Read!!,"Love my new 6"" display Kindle Book. It's so lightweight that I take it everywhere. I pull it out of my purse to read while I'm waiting in a public venue. I love the diversity of reading material selections which I can read anytime and anywhere in the world. The screen is unlike a harsh computer screen; so, I can read for hours without blinking an eye! I don't ever have to clutter up my house or destroy trees with pleasure reading books. Happy Reading to ALL 'KINDLERS'!"
4,I Like the Kindle....but,"So much to give thanks for but it's not perfect.Great ereader for the eyes because of the screen technology. Pat on the back for the ease of downloading new books. Backup of purchases and personal notes is wonderful. There's so much too applaud with this product.... butI hate the method of cursor movement. It's so clunky that it deserves the antiquated technology of the year award. Slow to move, at times it's not real time since the cursor takes time to move and is very frustrating.Bottom line.... I buy it again but I can dream can't I."
4,VERY COMFORTABLE AND USEFUL,INTERNATIONAL VERSION- VERY EASY FOR MANUAL- GET THE GOOD INFORMATION- ANYTIME CAN READ
1,DMR Abuse - 'nuff said,"Silly silly Amazon. Recent abuse of indefensible DRM could only ever result in the backlash Amazon are currently experiencing.Semantic arguments about the legal entitlement of purchasers pale into insignificance in the face of such a key issue - the arbritary capability of this global company to delete purchased content from within peoples homes....and to consider such action reasonable. It's morally indefensible unless Amazon's capability and general intent to do so on near-whimsical grounds was painted in glowing neon letters on page 1 of any purchaser agreement.When you sell something Amazon...SELL IT. Or refer to it honestly as, say, an extended rental.It's this Orwellian capability, (an irony no one has overlooked), open to MANY forms of abuse, which is a primary cause for concern. Color me ashamed of Amazon -my selection of e-book reader will not shackled by such biased DRM. My transactions go elsewhere in future."
1,Holy Shades of 1984!,"I was seriously thinking about getting one of these seemingly wonderful devices. My mom had the kindle 1 and loved it. But today I heard the news about Amazon removing Orwell's books from owners who had purchased it.It isn't so much that these books were removed, as much as the realization that Amazon can remove books that I would have thought were in my possession. This is just unacceptable. Promises that such happenings would be rare is not enough to convince me that it is safe to own this machine.If Amazon wants me to buy it they will have to demonstrate their good faith by making it possible to back up my content elsewhere. I don't trust them to remove this capability from the machine."
1,1984 indeed,"So let me get this straight. Amazon wants me to drop $489 on a device that they can remove content off of at THEIR whim! Not no but hell no. Was going to buy a Kindle DX but I'll wait until another product comes out that is lower cost and I actually OWN the content. So long Kindle, not nice knowing ya."
2,restricted options,"This would be a great product if Amazon treated its customers fairly. I used airline miles to purchase a gift card with the idea that I would use it for my subscriptions. Amazon refuses to let money on deposit with Amazon be used for subscriptions. Their gift card paage says nothing about not working on subscriptions. They are just sitting on the money.A few months ago, Amazon decided it could delete books from your Kindle.Be careful in trusting Amazon to perform as it says."
1,"Save time, money, frustration and tech addiction: buy a book","For $299 you can buy 300 to 1200 books at your local thrift store; or read them free at your local library. Save yourself from technology frustration, addiction and dependence: buy books. They don't break, freeze, or become obsolete. I'm a bookstore manager and literature major; bought a Kindle, and all it did was prove that some forms of technology really are worse than the real thing."
1,Beware of stolen Kindles!,"I got my Kindle 1 for my birthday last year and loved it. However, I accidentally left it on a plane and foolishly had no contact info stamped on the outside of it. The worst part is that Amazon has absolutely NO support for stolen Kindles. They will deregister it for you, however that just gives the thief an open door to re-register - free Kindle for them! I entered a dummy credit card number for 1-click immediately and have since gotten emails that the credit card for the books ""I'm"" trying to buy has been denied. So I know that a thief has it. I have emailed my info to the Kindle so hopefully the thief will read it and return it. It's unconscionable that Amazon has no system in place for assisting with stolen Kindles. They clearly just want you to shell out another $359. It's a great device, but make sure to put your contact info all over it. I'd like to think that there are honest people in the world who would return it should you ever lose it."
2,"Kindle 1 battery died in 10 months, your Kindle 2 will too. AND YOU CAN'T REPLACE IT.","My Kindle 1 battery died in 10 months, your Kindle 2 will too, just you wait. AND YOU CAN'T REPLACE IT. It will be replaceable under warranty for free for one year, but you have to send it in to Amazon to have them fix it. And after warranty? YOU HAVE TO PAY $60.00!Would you like to know what it's like to have your Kindle suddenly die from a dead battery? This is what it's like: the screen is wiped. It responds to nothing, switching it on and off Whispernet off or on, plugged in or not. NOTHING. A BRICK.HAVE FUN.The Kindle is the biggest rip off in recent history."
1,Kindle 2 had problem...returned for refund,"I was really looking forward to receiving the Kindle 2.When I received it, one of the Amazon.com pages stayed in the background on the screen and bled through whatever I tried to read. Also, the print of what I was trying to read was not very distinct...almost grayed out.I called customer service and got someone outside of the U.S. that I had great difficulty understanding. This person could not suggest a solution and wanted to send me another Kindle.By this time I had lost patience and just returned the Kindle (plus the cover I bought to go with it) for full refund.Not a happy sequence!"
2,cost of books,"I purchased a Kindle several months ago. I use it daily. I am very pleased with the the Kindle and its features. Here is what I don't like.1. my biggest complaint is the cost of books. Many of the books I buy offer a meager 10% discount off Amazon's normal price. I think that is unexceptable for an electrotic book especially when I have already paid for PRIME and $259.00 for the Kindle reader.2. Availability of non-fiction books can be rather limited.3. Some Kindle books allow you to view the footnotes as you read the book, many do not. I perfer easy access to footnotes as I read.4. Graphics are poor at best. If you reading a book that has ""side bars"" which are necessary for a full understanding of the book, you to will be disappointed.5. The experimental text to speech feature is nearly worthless for non-fiction books.6. a few books contain many transcription errors."
1,worthless,"CAUTION!!!!!BE SURE TO CHECK THE COVERAGE MAP. IF YOU DO NOT LIVE IN A MAJOR METRO LOCATION YOU CAN FORGET DOWNLOADING A BOOK. 30 MIN TO DOWNLOAD A SAMPLE CHAPTER, THE BOOK I BOUGHT HAS BEEN TRYING FOR TWO HR AND STILL HAS NOT FINISHED,(KEEPS LOSING CONNECTION AND STARTING OVER). BOUGHT 2 OF THESE WORTHLESS PILES OF C##P. WILL BE SENDING THEM BACK POST HASTE.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
3,Kindle for Canada,The Kindle is fine-every good quality that many have mentioned-I wish that I had kown that certain books would be unavailable in Canada.
4,Good technology but still too xpensive,A little too big and the plastic seems a little cheap but still a great product easy to store books and convenient for travel. Still not sure why these things are so expensive but with other similar products on the market hopefully the price will come down. If you like the nostalgia of a book this may not be for you but for convenience and an easy read good technology.
5,"I love it, looking to buy another. The greatest device ever!!!","The best in e-readers, if you dont have one, get one. If you dont like to read, and dreamed of always wanting too. You will"
5,Kindle,"I received my Kindle as a Christmas present. I was really torn between the Kindle and the Kindle DX. After receiving it and using it, I LOVE IT and am not sorry I decided on the Kindle. It stores in my purse, is easily used. I don't get as tired reading from it and battery life is excellent. One thing I would suggest for future versions - a password protection feature. It's a little too easy to order books and although I try to keep it attended at all times, I wouldn't want a young family member to pick it up and start reading it."
3,Kindle and Audible Horrible,"Absolutely love my Kindle but since I listen to audible books a good portion of the time just a caveat to those that are thinking of signing up to Audible to listen on your Kindle, Don't do it! Very disappointing almost unusable. Audio books transfer over only in sections no chapters which means you have no idea where you are in relation to the chapters of the book, transferring between sections in Kindle puts you in the middle of a chapter somewhere in the book."
3,Interesting idea - but ....,"I am really interested in this product - and even if nobody can tell me, when it will be possible to purchase german book titles via kindle, I wanted to buy this ebook reader.Amazon will deliver this product with an american power supply - o.k. not optimal for european/german customers but not a major problem ...I started to order a Kindle with leather cover for roundabout 280 dollars - and than all of the sudden in EURO (with an additional fee nobody understands ) it should be ca. 270 EURO. Considering EURO : Dollar 1,5 : 1 this is an ridicolous price.So I stopped ordering and I am waiting for an european/german solution ....Ralf Oppenkowski"
5,Great Cover,"This is a great cover for the kindle, It gives the kindle a book like feel and a nice place to place the light for reading at night. It so nice my wife wants one for her kindle."
5,fantastic and alot of fun,"we bought two of the kindles so there would be no fighting as to who got to use it. best buy we ever made. we've enjoyed the ease of reading,ordering books and the over-all product. lives up to the hype for a change. we sit outdoors quite a bit and there is no glare problem. just over-joyed with our kindles."
5,Love it!!,"I'm so glad I finally purchased a Kindle. The price was right and I'm sure it will pay for itself in time. I love the lightness of it, the convenience, being able to read anytime, anywhere. 5 stars!"
1,"Kindle lets you ""borrow"" books from Amazon","until they decide to take 'em back, even after you've paid for 'em.I would not even consider buying one of these things until they guarantee they won't unilaterally go in and muck with the contents!"
1,content that dissappears does not a valid platform make,Kindle is now officially a dead format. If you buy a book it will never bee yours. You are just renting it only Amazon decides when you get to return it. Earlier today Amazon wiped all the downloaded copies of 1984 and another book from every kindle connected online. This was to appease the publisher of the pressing that the kindle had been selling. Amazon issued refunds but the fact remains Kindle is no viable platform for owning books. They have no reason to support a consumer. 1984 was 99 cents before it was removed. what's to stop the publisher from re-releasing it for 1.99? No Amazon I don't think I'll ever have a need for your device.
3,My 2nd Kindle,"Why the 2nd kindle. Hmmm sharing books around the house is faster and takes up a lot less space. Now the Kindle 2// faster page turning. Slightly better screen resolution, Significantly thinner, good battery life, Great for the traveler except for international web access; overall for me a great purchase; HOWEVERWhat more do I want: a clear return policy for ebooks - if I hate a book I bring it back to the store on ebooks what do you do; International access for the web; Color screen if for nothing else the covers- there is value in the cover art; a flag for the books I have read / not read and when I read them - sort of a properties folder for the books; better menu control; easier sharing with-in the same family on different accounts; Smarter on line book searching (really amazon not kindle); and it the kindle needs to accept more ebook formats."
4,"I love my Kindle 2, but...","I love my Kindle 2 and use it all the time. The only problem, which is not, in my opinion, Kindles problem is that many of the newspaper downloads arrive way to late (usually in the yearly or late afternoon) so I have canceled all of them). OK, one other small problem...I also learned on more thing about the Kindle. With the ""DX"" model coming out so soon after the ""2"" I will not be buying a Kindle upgrade for a very, very long time. I know now that a new model will always be just around the corner. I would have waited the two months for the DX if any hint was given about it ""coming soon"". Not a big deal, but I do like to keep up with the latest in these kinds of things and in the case of Kindle I will simply stay with my ""old"" 2 model until it breaks down."
3,Love the Kindle hate the price of books,"While I love the Kindle, Amazon has changed their pricing so that many books are not only no cheaper than the paperback version, they are actually more expensive! When buying the Kindle I was figuring in that I would save a little bit of money on each book, which is certainly not true. While it's nice not to have the books cluttering up the house, the pricing is deceptive at best. You'll see them list a ""digital price"" to make it appear as if you're getting a price break. When you follow the link to the paperback, you'll see that the cost is no better than a paperback. Let the buyer beware!"
3,A bit disappointed in the Kindle 2,"I own the original Kindle and also the Kindle 2. I considered returning the Kindle 2 because the two buttons for turning to the next page make a loud clicking sound. My original Kindle did not have this problem. Welcomed improvements in the (new) Kindle 2 are screen contrast and faster ""page turning."""
3,MY WIFE IS A LUDDITE,"Kindle 2: My wife is 83. She really wanted one. I bought it for her. Unfortunately she is a luddite ... afraid of anything that is computer-like or cellphone-like. When she decides on a book she wants I will set her up. Once she is ""into it"" I am sure she will be delighted. We bought it becsue of your boss's interview on Charley Rose."
5,I'm using it less and less as time goes by...,"I purchased a Kindle 2 for myself for X-Mas--and as time has gone by I have used it less and less. The problem isn't that I don't like it (I love it). The problem is my husband. He has somehow taken over ownership of the Kindle. Each night he & I have a discussion about who gets to use it before bed. Since I usually have a pile of magazines to go thru, guess who gets it?Last night, I purchased another Kindle 2 (for my husband)."
3,Kindle International Disappointment,"I am disappointed that when ordering the Kindle, there was little or no warning that far fewer titles are available to Australian users than in the US. Many of my favourite authors are not represented at all, or if they are then only with few of their works.Similarly no Australian and very few Italian newspapers are offered.Over time I expect that the range will be extended but had I known the limitations I may have delayed the purchase, which was intended as a gift, but now I'm not sure it will be well received."
4,"Page numbers, please","I bought the Kindle as an alternative to lugging at least 50 pounds of textbooks to class every day. I was even able to find several of the books I needed already in Kindle format. I just had one major problem, which I didn't realize would be such a big deal. There are no page numbers. That's fine for reading assignments, but as soon as my professors started referencing page numbers in class, I was lost. The same problem exists if I want to reference a particular section of the text, especially for citations.I really liked the Kindle, and I think it would be perfect for recreational reading, but I had to return it. Amazon was very helpful and even refunded my shipping costs. If the issue with page numbers can be worked out, I really think this could be a valuable tool for college students, especially with the high prices of textbooks."
4,"Love it, but","I love my new Kindle 2. Love it. It does actually disappear when reading and I can read lying down, sprawled on the sofa, on the beach holding my Kindle in one hand, turning pages easily with my thumb. Way big improvement over print books for many reasons listed in countless other reviews.But:I wish the contrast was better. Sometimes even with large print it is hard to read.I wish the next page button didn't make such a loud clicking noise.I wish more of the books and magazines I want to read were available on it. Of four books I'm reading currently only one was available on Kindle. Please more poetry, more literary magazines, more fiction in translation.I wish I could create folders for the titles on my Kindle and click to show or disappear contents."
4,Kindle,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the Kindle. It is great for traveling, easy to read and much more manageable than heavy books."
5,Kindle 2,"The best investment I have made for many years. It's a joy to read on it and I read faster than when reading a paper book.I read more now than I usually did when reading paper books because it's easier to handle than a paper book.I love the fact that I can download a book, magazine or a newspaper in under a minute."
4,Exchange rates!,"I am an Amazon fan from the U.K. and have used Amazon over the years for many things, but mainly books. The Kindle I recently bought is a wonderful invention for those of us who like to read voraciously; particularly when wanting to go on holiday! There is one big snag for those of us who live on the other side of the pond and that is that we have to buy our Kindle and downloads for it in dollars rather than in pounds sterling. At moments when the currency values are fluctuating wildly it is not very satisfactory. When, I should like to know, will Amazon.co.UK be able to supply books for Kindle in the local currency?The cover that I purchased with my Kindle is also of good quality and I am perfectly happy with it."
5,The Best,"The Kindle 2 is the best one yet. Light weight, easy to use, can ajust the size of the font so you can read easier. I would recomend this to anyone who would like to stop having to fight with holding a book, trying to keep the pages mark or fighting with them to keep the book open."
2,Battery Life?,"I have the wireless permanently turned off. 2 weeks Battery life? This is a serious issue with this device. I am lucky if the fully recharged battery lasts 2 days, never mind 2 weeks. My Kindle is not a month old. What is going on here? deceptive marketing?"
2,Overpriced technology,I purchased a Kindle because the how-to book I needed was only available in that format.This type of technology seems quite pricey and inconvenient compared to a print book. About $200 . . . and you have to charge it after short periods of reading. What the point?!
5,Better than the Nook,"I purchased the Kindle 2 for a friend as a Christmas gift; I already have the Kindle 1 and love it. At the time, the Nook came out (same price) so I compared the 2 and found the Kindle to be superior. Another friend has the Nook and we both found the touch screen technology to be difficult and uses up your screen space. the keypad is touch screen also. He complained that the first books he wanted to purchase were not available for the Nook; his selections were from the Best Seller's list or newly published. My Kindle 2 friend can't put her's down; she's extremely pleased with it."
5,Review of the Kindle,The Kindle is an awesome product. It has hundreds of functions and is very user friendly. The global wireless function is fantastic and downloaded books are available within 2 minutes of less. The screen is easy to read and there's no glare or eye strain. Absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone.
1,Disappointment,"This is my second Kindle. I purchased one in September('09) which my wife uses and it is terrific. However, two months later I purchased another for myself in November and it's the newest version, Global generation.The wireless does not work in my area and I have to go to any place that will generate signal-strength bars and connect to Amazon. The reason for this is that it uses a different network. My wifes' unit uses AT&T and is GREAT! The global version uses SPRINT and is very disappointing. If only they continued to produce the U.S. version, I would swap my global in a nano-second!"
1,so disappointing,"Ordered the kindle as soon as it was available for my partner's Birthday. Initial impression was great with the packaging and ""apple like"" design - but then we tried to use it. We've sent it back and received a full refund as frankly it's just not ready and the Sony E book is superior at just about every level. Battery life, cataloging your books, ease of use all were inferior and the suposed added functions such as the internet access just didn't work. The final nail in the coffin was the very limited availability outside the US of books and magazines. One star for trying but frankly outside the US - don't believe the hype"
2,Good start but way more to go.,"The Kindle is streamlined for buying content from Amazon. If you already have a collection of items in PDF/Word etc you want to read on this device - forget about it.Also, I would like to have a little folding stand at the back of the unit so I can put it on the table and not hold it all the time.For a $299 device - couldn't amazon include a bag?And if you want your content sent to your kindle - .12 cents a megabyte...Its a good start but I think with some competition this device will get to the right cost and right specs."
2,Kindle a bummer,"Nice enough e-reader but the inability to access library books is a bummer. Why ""buy"" a book and not be able to share it. I can loan a hard copy of a purchased book to anybody. This product is way to restrictive. I returned it! Amazon e-books are very expensive. I don't get it....no printing or distribution cost."
4,Excellent but room for improvement.,Overall I love this product. My biggest complaint is more with the ebooks than the kindle. Many books have no Table of contents. When Reading Technical manuals and I would like to skip around in these books and use then for reference.
4,Lovin the K2 So Far!,"I left work early to be home when my K2 arrived, cannot tell you the excitement watching the days go by until it's arrival. 2 hours in my hands now and although I had to refrain from trying to read everything and try all the features until it is charged, I have to admit that thus far I am not disappointed. Loved the original Kindle and do have to admit that I thought I would sell the first version to justify getting the K2 within a year of the first purchase, however I believe I will keep both. Sounds crazy I am sure, but the SD card was a downer for me as I have all my books backed up to the card in case my computer crashes or something. I believe the K2 will be exclusively for travel because of the size and the improved buttons. Curious to see though if my original Kindle will also know the pages of a book that I have already read on my K2 throughout the day...time will tell."
1,Buyer Beware - Amazon can and will delete books remotely,"I was thinking about getting a kindle for the convenience of being able to carry multiple books and newspapers with me at once, but there is NO WAY I would even think about buying one now that Amazon has decided it is entitled to remotely delete purchased content from Kindles. Once I buy a book, electronic or hard copy, I expect to own it."
3,Kindle,"It is certsainly convenient to have books at ones fingertips;literally.It is a bit disconcerting tht it is very difficult to connect to web when ordering new books or searching the bookstore,etc."
1,BE CAREFUL if you live in Canada,"I'm probably just one of several Canadians who got ""sandbagged"" by Amazon's deceptive advertising that the Kindle is now available to ship to Canada.Bought into the story and ordered it. When it arrived discovered a lot features disabled because I'm in Canada (30 miles from the border) and when I called customer support, they guided me through the on-line ""caveat emptor"" statements Amazon has buried on-line.If you go through two screens after their HUGE advertisment and scroll to the bottom of the latter, you find out that not all the content and capability available on the U.S. version is available here on the Canadian version."
3,If only the screen had a backlight option!,"When my Kindle arrived, I was so excited to start using it. I had planned to take it with me when I travelled on business without having to lug around a heavy hardback book. I was so disappointed to find that the screen did not have a backlight option - I just assumed it would. I returned the Kindle, but if they ever add this option I'd buy it! While the screen is said to be very book-like as is, I would rather have the functionality and convenience of reading anytime/anywhere without the need for an external light source."
3,Average,The item was shipped immediately and arrived earlier than expected. The item was accurately described and portrayed in the ad. It is expensive for what it is.
5,Kindle Love,"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. Bar none. I spend so much on books but with the Kindle not only are the books cheaper, but they're much easier to carry! My only concern? I wish there were more titles available for download. I read some obscure stuff, though, so finding my books in a regular book store is just as difficult. I love the fact that many classics are available for free. From Dracula and Frankenstien to Pride and Predjudice and Sensibility, its all there! It's wonderful!!"
2,Disappointed in Kindle,"I waited a long time before I bought my Kindle and I was really disappointed in it when it came. It was easy enough to use, easy to purchase books but just didn't like reading on it. I found the delay in turning pages to be distracting at first and then just plain annoying. I purchased a cover for it when I first bought the Kindle and tried using it both ways. I found it very uncomfortable to hold for any length of time without the cover on. The charge on the battery ended up not being as long as I had hoped for. Also, a lit screen would have been much better to read with.Overall, if the Kindle had been less expensive, I might have held on to it but there were just too many negatives to justify the $359 price tag. I really wanted to like the Kindle but it just didn't work out for me.Kathy"
1,Ill consideration for the consumer,Product has very poorly written instructions I have not been able to get it to work. There are limited resorces available listed.
4,great but it needs some tweaking,"I really like my kindle A LOT! it has revolutionized the way that I read. I can actually see/read now. But.I thought that I was going to be able to read PDFs on the Kindle. But it's really impossible. The type is too small and the ability to increase the type size doesn't work with PDFs.When I read a sample and then order the book, I am unable to find the place where the end of the sample left off.I wish that the Kindle maintained pagination. That would certainly help with the above listed problem.Images and photos don't really translate too well.I read the New York Times daily and I really like this feature. However, I keep thinking that I'm not getting all of the articles. (I could be wrong on that.)Oh, and couldn't they add a clock? And how about making it easier to organize books and periodicals?The above items are a few things that I would like to see improved. But, I still love my Kindle."
3,No page numbers,"No page numbers. Really annoying. Problematic if you're using it to read assigned texts for graduate school. I wish Kindle had a solution for this problem because right now, I'm regretting that I didn't just wait and get an I-pad."
4,Traveling Bookworm's Dream!!,"Just got my K2, and (sorry naysayers) I LOVE it!!I travel and hate lugging around multiple books. I am running out of space at home for book storage. I like getting new books FAST! K2 addresses all of these issues nicely!!Read the other bad reviews, and maybe I got lucky, cuz I've had no problems, so far. And for all the 'backlight' fans.....Backlighting on a reading device causes HEADACHES!! I hate reading on my laptop for this very reason.3 minor issues, which inspired the 4 star instead of 5 star rating...1. Should have come with a cover. Even a cheapo cover would have been nice, while I'm waiting on my backorderd K2 cover.2. Background on screen IS too dark/gray, as compared with a book. If it could be lightened up, it would boost the contrast, and be a blessing to those of us who read voraciously.3. Only in WHITE? C'mon Amazon!! Nothing shows dirt faster than WHITE!!!"
3,Kindle incomplete,"From the international version of kindle people would expect to get it with a plug that fits to local market or at least with an adapter for the local country.This is something Amazon should improve fast and for earlier customers it is advised to provide the adapter f.o.c. as soon as it becomes available.Another very bad point is the fact that virtually no german laguage e-books are available from Amazon. Therefore it is complicated to get german language books which run on the Kindle International, fotunately there is a software like Calibre available.."
5,CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT,"Just love my kindle, don't know what i did without it, do alot of travelling and it is alot easier to bring along my thin, light weight kindle instead of 10 books on a holiday, everyone who likes to read should own one, you won't be disappointed-"
2,Can't get textbooks yet...,"I've been looking to get an amazon kindle because as a student, being able to consolidate all those heavy textbooks into one 10.2 oz device seemed like it was too good to be true. Then I found out that it was! You cannot get your college textbooks on kindle....at least yet. They say they're going to expand to every book in all languages, but why haven't they tapped the vast market of tech savvy college students yet? Until textbooks are available on kindle, you won't see me spending my hard-earned $300 on this device."
1,Had it in cart pulled out of purchase,"I'll be honest I was only getting this for the Wireless Wikipedia access as my main E-Book reader is a 9"" other brand and would not of even been affected by the pulling of the Orwell books from other Kindle consumers device. But, I can get by without wireless access so long as Amazon maintains the mandatory usage of DRM and control over your 'license to read' material. If I buy a book, esp fiction I should be able to sell it. <--- note the period. Buying books on Amazon instead of my local used bookstore would cost me 100's of dollars more a year and I could never recoup the extra costs because once you buy a book you are stuck with it till you or Amazon dies."
1,"Amazon owns the content you buy, NOT YOU","I certainly would NOT buy Kindle. Under their 'Terms of Service', they can revoke your access to the Service or your Digital content, without notice to you and without refund. That doesn't sit well with me at all. Nope, not for me."
1,Don't buy a new KINDLE if you don't know the wireless coverage in your area,I am extremely disappointed with the fact that KINDLE changed some type of software so that if an area does not have ATT coverage you can not use the KINDLE. My father received a KINDLE for his birthday and loved it. We then bought one 3 months later for my mother for Christmas and it won't work. After many hours on the phone my father was told that the software had changed and the only way they could get books was to download them on the computer and then transfer them which defeats the whole purpose. AMAZON should write a new disclaimer since they changed the product as this was the fourth KINDLE we had purchased as a gift and now we are concerned about buying any more
1,"The Orwell fiasco: Bye bye, Amazon","I would never consider buying a Kindle now that Amazon has acted to delete users' e-books. I suppose it's good that Amazon values its publisher relationships so highly, because its reputation couldn't get much worse with this customer. Maybe the publishers will buy all that product."
2,Big storage problem,"I just got my Kindle for Christmas and the whole concept of electronic books is just awsome. The device is nice, and neat but there is just on big thing missing: the possiblility of having folders to sort the books.I started sharing the device with my wife and after having dowloaded a few books and many samples there is just no way of separating my books, her books, my read samples (to be aquired later) my samples to be read and her own samples. It's become quite messy in just a few weeks. I don't want to imagine the book/sample surfing in a few month it's just totally impractical.Just picture an iPod with no playlist and having to scan for your music everytime beetween hundred and thousands of songs ..... that would be the kindle !Too bad, the product is great, the concept is awsome but the navigation is just a big bummer."
4,Help anyone.,"I love my Kindle, however, I have not yet conquered how to turn it off so that it comes back to the last page read. I have tried, per Kindle instructions, to turn it off by using the home key. No joy there. I have allowed it to turn itself off. No joy there. Most of the time it return to the correct place, but when it doesn't it is extremely difficulty to remember where you were. No page numbers, bad, bad. I understand this might be difficult as changing font size would mess with that. However, what am I dong wrong. Any help would be appreciated. I talked to Kindle help desk and did not get much help in this retard.Gillian"
4,My Kindles,I ordered 3 Kindles. Two were fine. I gave one to my partner and she is very pleased with it. I am also pleased with mine. But the 3rd one would not work. I phoned Amazon but we could not sort it out. I returned it and asked for a refund which has been given to me. Although Amazon were very sympathetic and cooperative it was quite a hassle. I feel that that kindle could not have been properly tested and you should check on your quality control proceedures. You have a great product otherwise.
3,Great To Read...But Lacks Too Many Titles,"The Kindle 2 is a wonderful reader, though I have no means to compare it to the new iPad and its capabilities. I love the portability. I am extremely disappointed in the number of books I wanted to buy but which aren't available, and with the extremely clumsy navigation system used to get around. For having lots of books handy and easy to read, though, the Kindle is just fine!"
4,Kindle Review,I am enjoying my new Kindle. So far it's been easy to use and the battery lasts at least a week. I haven't missed turning pages - - and ordering books is super easy.
3,It's not a real book,"If you like the way the book feels, smells, or looks on paper. Then I wouldn't suggest getting an reader let alone a kindle. Just not the same caliber of what you would expect."
1,No response to email - Beware before you buy,"i bought this for my sister but her husband bought her an IPAD so she did not want to keep it. I decided to return this and when I submitted to return the item, it said i had till august 19th. amazon claims august 13th. i say lies. i am not happy that they penalized me by charging me a restocking fee over 20%. not cool at all. i was going to buy another one since the price is $139.00 now but $189.00 when i bought it for my sister. wrote to them about it and i have not heard from them. no response. no customer service. because of this incident, they can keep their kindle, i'm buying an IPAD!!!!!!"
2,"Kindle lacks ePUB support, get a Nook instead!","I bought a Kindle for myself without realizing how limited it is. It doesn't even support ePUB format! That's like an MP3 player not supporting MP3s! So save yourself a huge headache and get a Nook instead - I've bought a Nook for everyone in my family and they love it! Plus it supports ePUB which just about every book is published in, so ditch the Kindle and get a Nook!"
5,very good screen even in direct sunlight,"I was amazed at the readability of the screen. There is no glare/fading or squinting of the eyes to see the text - even in direct sunlight. There is no getting headaches even after hours of reading.It is easy to use and lightweight (a book would be heavyier). Downloading is quick, easy and the same for bying new books (thats almost too easy = I tend to by too much). The built-in dictionary is very handy and comprehensive.The delivery was swift and problemfree."
4,The world with Kindle,It is a great product. I love the fact that it doesn't hurt your eyes. Reading made easy. I love the word puzzles that they offer too.
1,"Times Square, New York City.","If you're in Times Square New York City, there's a store selling this at a cheaper price than Amazon. Like 40-50% cheaper. I did not inquire but they looked exactly the same and the accessories was much cheaper. Just a heads up to all of you in case you travel to the Big Apple."
2,are authors and publishers boycotting Kindle?,"I like my Kindle2 a lot, BUT I'm astonished how many books I'd like to buy are not available on it."
1,The screen went dark and it is not fixable,The screen went completely dark and Amazon's policy is to charge me $180 for a replacement (used) original Kindle. I feel completely ripped off.
5,Traveling with Kindle,"An avid reader, I recently purchased one for an extended trip to Sweden. I purchased it with the intent of replacing the several books I usually lug around on trips. For that purpose, it worked great. Long battery life, and the size made it worry free and easy to use and carry on trains and planes. New book purchases were also easy to download from my PC when I was in the hotel (PC interface was intuitive). Also a news junky, I was disappointed when I could not get wireless delivery of daily newspapers while there. I look forward to the day when Amazon gets the agreements with the wireless providers in Europe so that I can use the Kindle seamlessly overseas for both new book purchases and newspapers. In the meantime, it was a great way to carry a small library while traveling (and a fun conversation piece to share with my Swedish friends)."
5,Awesome bit of Kit,"My wife and I bought each other a [International] Kindle for Christmas, which we subsequently took on a cruise to Hawaii. Normally we would take about 10 books with us, that we would read and donate to the ships library to avoid having to carry them home.This time we each took about 110 books, total cost about $100, in our Kindle's, left none behind when we read them and were never without a darn good read within arms reach.We love our Kindle's and found them really easy to use, very convenient, and as an added bonus they attract other people to talk with you - other Kindle users - people who are intrigued by your use of the Kindle, etc.Do we recommnd them ? What do you think !"
1,Bye bye Amazon,"Amazon has taken the trust I had in them and shattered it by the Orwellian fiasco and the huge drop in price. I was an early adopter of Kindle 1 an was enamored of it until it broke. I had to save up to buy a K2 because I'm retired and disabled. I was devastated when I saw the $70 price drop just a few days after my chance to return it had passed. I have used Amazon over the years because they are convenient for a disabled person. Never again. My days as a loyal Amazon shopper are over. I know that my few items don't add up to a lot to Amazon, but it does to me. Never again."
4,"Love my Kindle, but...","I have my Kindle since April of this year and I really love, love reading on it. I decided for the 6"" display as it is a nice and handy size and I can carry it all the time with me in my purse. I love being able to buy new eBooks from whereever I go. I even did so during my recent cruise in the Caribean, how cool is that?The battery life is outstanding; if you turn wireless off during such times you don't need it, it lasts for weeks. So far, I'm very happy with the ease of handling and quality of my Kindle. I would not like going back to paperbooks.My only critique is the eBook selection, i.e. new releases that are not available to customers from Canada. I have looked the other day for new eBooks in the Amazon/Kindle book store and out of 10 books that I was interested in, 8 books were not available to Canadian customers, kind of frustratin, but I hope that will be changing."
4,A little disappointed...,I love the ease of use and convenience in being able to carry more than one book with me for I read very fast as a rule... I was a little disappointed in the size of the screen but have gotten used to it.
4,New Kindle user,"I've wanted a Kindle for a long time and finally broke down and bought one. I'm really glad I did! It takes a little while to get used to reading something other than a paper book, but after one novel I found it very comfortable and I can quickly ""get lost"" in what I'm reading. The included dictionary is very sweet and easy to use. The best thing for me is I don't have to have a stack of paper books waiting to be read (I was always worried about running out of things to read). Now when I finish a book I can go to my ""Save For Later"" list and in less than a minute I've downloaded a new book and am reading again. I'm going on a trip next week and won't have to take 3 or 4 books with me either! I keep the wireless turned off and I've only had to charge it every couple weeks."
5,sure beats lugging paperbacks around!,"On a recent overseas holiday i read nine large paperback novels. All books i enjoyed and would like to have kept. However with strict weight restrictions i had to leave them behind as i finished them, such a waste as i often enjoiy re-reading a good book. My husband who is much more electronic savvy than i suggested i look into an e-book. once home i did a bit of research and found the Kindle. Life will never be the same! So many books so little time. My Kindle and i a seldom apart and i am enjoying a wide range of books that i can keep forever without needing to buy a new bookcase. The size is perfect, the weight is perfect and the speed of download just amazing. Cannot reccomend it highly enough."
1,"I want to love the Kindle, too.",I was excited about getting a Kindle because my daughter (Denise Hope) enjoys hers so. Butwhen it came it took overnight to load on the bible I wanted. I called her and she said itonly takes seconds to load - maybe because she is in Chicago area and I am in Alabama. ????So I am waiting for her to come in Oct. to see if she can load something. I am quite computerliterate - but ...
3,"I like it, but... no books in spanish","Don't know if it's an Amazon problem or Spanish editorial problem. But the kindle, as nice as it is, it's pretty worthless if you don't speak english.We need more books in spanish, please.I can read english (more or less), but I would like to give it to my parents as a present. I wont until they can easily buy books in their mother language from the amazon store."
3,kindle wireless reading,"I enjoy using the kindle reading device HOWEVER, I was disappointed with the following :1. Unable to purchase books from other sources2. Unable to email documents to my kindle3. Not being advised when the free newspaper or magazine subscription was over.Regarding the 1st 2 items, I was advised it was because these services were not available in Canada. This was NOT MADE CLEAR on reviewing the details of the device before purchase.Also, I am surprised at the cost of some of the books. I understand that other reading devices, when purchased come with a large number of free CURRENT books. I think you should review your policy on selling kindles."
5,Is the best thing ever!!!,"I only have to say 2 things...1- It was money more than well spend!! 2-Being allergic have dragged my library from tons of books to almost non at all from a few years back when I discovered I was allergic to dust, mood, etc. So having the pleasure of my Kindle an 3 books at a time in one place is far more than what I could ask!!!!I never had to put it way for battery it last all the time in the world -when not connected to wireless- I do put it to charge from time to time...And buying a Kindle book and start reading it in minutes is awesome!!!!"
1,You duped me!,I am not of the WalMart pricing mentality as one author - who will not be named - categorized consumers like me.I work in a library and researched this form of media consumption before purchasing.Your price increases are a disappointment. You made a promise surrounding your product and now backed down.The consumer and our environment are the big losers here.So disappointed in Amazon and this product!
1,Amazon's Pricing Structure is Not Customer Friendly.,"The device is well built and the selection of books is quite abundant. You need to buy all of your publications from the same vendor Amazon, or you have to use third party software like Calibre to convert the formats. Don't try and deal with CS at amazon when the pricing drops the day after your order. They'll politely tell you to go get bent.Buy a Sony e reader or ipad and have a more flexible device platform."
1,Kindle not worth the price.,"The Kindle concept is awesome. I originally purchased it for an overseas trip. It was great at first, but it wasn't long before the screen fritzed out on me. Now I have an expensive piece of junk. That, combined with the fact that you have to pay to convert any free content you download from a non-Amazon site to the acceptable Kindle readable format, makes this product a very bad investment in my opinion. If you really want an e-reader, I suggest checking out Barnes & Noble's Nook. That's what I'll be getting as soon as I can afford to purchase another e-reader!"
3,NOT TO haapy RIGHT now!,"I purchase this thing and I like it but I paid 400.00 and now you are selling them for 259.00. Give me a break or give me a discount. I am not happy, I feel screwed over."
1,Waitng for the Mac version eBook,"Having read the negative reviews about Amazon's Kindle 1 and 2, I choose to wait to see what the folks at Apple will roll out on this front. Surely they can make a better product than the ones currently on the market, and when they do, I will be in line to make a purchase, just as I have done with their computers. Until then, paper and ink works fine for me."
2,WAY OVERPRICED,"This is WAY OVERPRICED at $359. I wouldn't bat an eye at paying $159 for it but they'll never sell me one for $359. Great product that they're trying to gouge the consumer for. Amazon will sell many hundreds, or thousands, of dollars on the content downloaded to it. That is where the money is and you can't get that money if you price them out of getting the hardware itself. This is the convenience stores loss leader setting outside where you got your gas. The books you'll buy are the pure profit coffee you bought inside when you stopped there to save a penny a gallon on the gas. Wake up and smell that pure profit coffee Amazon."
4,Kindle review,I really enjoy using the kindle. I have only one issue with it. Occasionally I like to look back to reread a section. This is very difficult with the kindle. You can't just flip pages.
1,Defective by design,"The aim of the printing industry used to be the enlightenment of the public. This is not achieved by a product intended to rob the public of the right to read what the public want, not what the Big Brother wants"
1,DRM is a threat to freedom,"I came to this review through Free Software Foundation. However, I truly agree that restrictions on this equipment infringe fundamental rights. As this device is intended to be a book, or several books, or publications the right of the owner, as a consumer, is violated, along with other, more fundamental rights, relating to personal rights to information. I loaned and borrowed books repeatedly during my life, without any infringement of the law. Now, what's changed?"
5,kindle reader,"this was a great purchase, i bought it for myself for christmas and was my best gift, i've read more in 2 months than all last year. highly recommended"
5,Love our Kindle,We use the Kindle every day- newspapers and books. Love it! A track ball would be an improvement for navigation.
5,Great product,What a great product. Compact and light to carry and hold while reading. Great screen to read in bed at night. Fits into bag for easy access in those times stuck in waiting que.Price of books very reasonable and lots of variety available. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Best gadget I ever received,"I have read more since I got my Kindle than I have in years. It is so much more convenient than paper books. Especially since I read a lot at night and all too often finish a book and would like to start another. With paper books you have to be prepared for that scenario, with my Kindle I can quickly get another book any time of the day. No running to the store, no waiting for the library to open.It is also nice to be able to carry so many books on the Kindle for when I am out running errands, Dr appts. etc. I always have something to read now and I don't have to decide until I wake the Kindle up."
4,Amazon will honor Kindle price reduction if bought after May 21,"Just got the kindle for father's day and i love it. now i just need to find time to read! my wife bought the kindle on june 9th, so Amazon is crediting us the difference ($70). i think if it was purchased after May 21, they will honor the price reduction and simply credit back your credit card. just call them, it only takes a minute. happy reading."
1,sounds like a scam,"I do not own one myself but as I got interested and dug for information about Kindle, I learned that Amazon takes the liberty of discarding books from devices behind customers' back (as well as private notes one may have added about the book).From the product overview: ""Buy a book and it is auto-delivered wirelessly in less than one minute."" It should be ""Rent a book...""Sounds crooked to me."
1,not until they have enough books and at reasonable prices,"It sounds wonderful, but after searching for Kindle versions of books that I own, and would like to carry with me digitally, and for others that I'd like to read, there're just not anywhere near enough books available at this time and the ones that are available are too high-priced for a digital version that would have to be viewed on such an expensive piece of equipment. If there was a bigger/better selection and the books were not so expensive, this sounds as if it would be a dream come true. I think that I'll wait a decade or so until Kindle catches up and can provide me with books that I would enjoy at a reasonable price."
3,"I like it but it's not perfect and for $359, I'm returning it.","The Kindle ist really cool. I love it. The problem is that it has a couple of design flaws that make it too flawed for my needs. Most importantly, the lack of back-lighting. I understand that this might not work with the e-ink technology but can't there be a place to hook on a light to the Kindle? Do I really have to buy a cover to attach the book light (and I have to buy the book light, too!). Books don't have back lights but they have pages and covers to attach a book light to.For $359, plus the cost of the books, the light problem is too big of a challenge for me. I'm returning it."
1,Dissapointed,"I received one kindle and it broke as I placed it on the table.It turned various shades of grey and had horizontal white lines all over the screen.They where kind of enough to ship me a replacement Kindle the next day.However the replacement one doesn't work either now (same issue).Perhaps they should design a better protective bumper around its side borders and perhaps protect the bottom a bit better, so this doesn't happen - again.Michael A."
1,Unfortunate,This device basically proves that control of electronic media by a central service that can adjust terms of service at will is not in the consumer's best interest. Do a search on Kindle and Orwell.
1,Kindle 2 Freeze,"This is the second kindle I have ordered for replacement and still it is freezing up after a couple of days of use. I have decide to wait till they get the bugs out of them before trying for the third. The other thing I noticed with this unit is that the battery on this one didn't last anywhere near the first one shipped. I had to leave plugged in, to use in the evening it just didn't have enough power to go for a few hours."
2,Content is overpriced,"Amazon markets Kindle showing popular content priced at $9.99. However, more and more of the new books are $4 to $5 more than that. At that price, I can purchase from Barnes and Noble and have the familiar ""pleasure"" of owning a book, without pagination issues and mispaced words. Moreover, books in paperback are actually cheaper than most of the Kindle versions and are readily available. The content is quite simply overpriced and the Kindle will shortly go the way of the dodo and the 8 track. I am sorry I made the purchase."
3,tj's kindle,"i received my purchase of a kindle second generation and far, far to much amozon junk mail. the kinle book is reasonably finctional, and the on/off switch is hard to use (too small). the page changers should have been just a little bit higher on the device. i have been unable to devote a lot of time reading my book as of yet as i have five hard back books in the que. once i have finished those, i will likely spend a lot more time reading. i particvularily like to read at bed time and so far the book seems up to for the reading!"
4,2nd generation gives way to the 3rd,"The 2nd generation Kindle was unable to receive books via 3G due to the location of our home. 4 days after receiving the 2nd generation Kindle, Amazon introduced the 3rd generation Kindle which can receive books via WiFi. This will allow me to download books directly without utilizing my PC. I returned the 2nd generation Kindle without a problem and now I am awaiting the 3rd generation Kindle."
5,Kindle Wireless Reading Device,I just love my kindle. I can keep it in my pocketbook and it is always ready when I have some down time to catch up on my reading. Looking forward to taking it to Europe and having access to many books to read while I am away.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"The lack of organizing titles is a huge disappointment. with a lot of content, this will become cumbersome.A math book with a lot of equations had some of the equations jumbled making the expensive book almost useless. I don't know the cause or if this will happen in other books. It makes me cautious about purchasing another of this type of book, which is one of the reasons I wanted the thing.For casual reading, it is vey nice but overall, a disappointment."
3,Italian readers....,are a bit disappointed that the choice of books in italian is so small.hope yon can do something to enlarge the choice otherwise is still better the old stinking paper book.
3,"fair prices for digital media, sharing and glare","Lately,I have discovered that digital books that I was interested in purchasing on my Kindle costs as much or more than as the same hard backed books that could be purchased in used (excellent) condition from Amazon third party sellers. Digital books by definition do not involve the same production costs and prices should reflect that difference.Previously to my purchase of Kindle, I have shared hardback books with friends. Unfortunately, I can not share digital books. It would be fair if the digital books were allowed a reasonable amount of duplication that would permit sharing of books. Arguably, when I purchase a book, the copy is mine to share with whom I like and Kindle infringes on that right of ownership.On the Kindle itself. I read at night using a book light so as to not disturb my sleeping wife. I have found that the surface of the Kindle screen produces glare and reflection which interferes with the reading experience."
3,"Good and inovative product,but limited in use in Poland.","Good and innovative product,but limited in use in Poland.I am quite satisfied with reading,but I can't use the Internet in Poland.I think that is unfair for people from outside The USA that they have to pay more for books on Amazon just because they are not American.It would be good if Amazon give certain number of books free of charge for people who have bought Kindle device."
2,Kindle died after One year and 4 months.,I picked the K2 over the Sony units on the strength of one feature:The auto dictionary.Being able to look up obscure or big words without leaving the page I am reading really enriches my experience and vocabulary.Update 7/20/2010My Kindle died tonight. The screen is filled with faint horizontal bars. The reset procuderes did not work. My reader is now a very expensive paperweight. My PSP and DS see far more use but are still going strong.What a disapointment. I'm getting an iTouch so I can continue reading my books but I am done with Amazon. Nook?
4,Nice applications. Fragile device.,"I bought this so that I could read books or literature anywhere w/o having to lug around books and manage pages. I thoroughly enjoy the applications in being able to download different materials I can access at different times during the day for my intended purposes (am Bible study, idle time/waiting for something reading, afternoon or evening reading for leisure, etc. It has been a wonderful addition in these regards. The screen, however, is very fragile and showed a black spot at the top, apparently from pressure that was put on the device while it was safely tucked inside the padded cover I had purchased separately. The spot never faded, and I just got a replacement unit only one month after purchase. The customer service on the exchange has been hassle free."
4,I Like the Kindle But Have One Issue...Any suggestions?,"I got the Kindle Global about two weeks ago and I like it alot...its everything the reviewers said it is but I have a problem with the CLICKING sound when I turn the pages. To me the click is too loud. My wife is a very light sleeper and she hears the loud click when I press the button to turn the pages....and can't sleep....since I am aware of it now it seems loud to me. I tried the Kindles of 2 of my friends and they made the same noise so I know its not just mine. I called customer service and the gentleman said he had gotten this complaint in the past and he said the click might diminish in a week or so...it hasn't. I really like the Kindle but am considering returning it for The Nook which has a silent swoosh page turning option. I'm hoping someone might have a suggestion before I am forced to take this option. Thanks, Tom p.s. don't suggest ear plugs or a new wife."
4,Love it and would like longer Battery life,"I love this product all the way! I travel all the time and now I can pack all my books with me on one device!! Brilliant. The screen is clear and reading is easy. I am reading faster and more books. I just wish that battery life would last longer than 2-3 days. Waiting for my upgrade, and otherwise, this is the perfect item for any reader!! I carry it with me in my purse everywhere I go!!! :-)"
4,Hello-a library at my finger tips!,"What I love most-easy to read, Amazon's inexpensive and extensive selection of books available every moment of every day, hence no more nothing-to-read-at-midnight blues. Best yet, no more books purchased by quickly read paragraphs or book flaps that turn out to be crap. Now I can sample a chapter before buying. If it doesn't grab me in the first chapter it never will. THANK YOU KINDLE!Why not 5 stars? I hate not being able to share the gems I'm reading. Please find a way for us to lend books to other kindle owners--one or two weeks and then returned to our library."
2,My favourite authors not available,"I bought a kindle after reading and hearing positive reviews. I was sold on the idea that there were over 300,000 book titles available for instant download.Imagine my disappointment to discover when I searched some of my favourite authors, some, whom by the way are very popular, were not available for the Kindle.""John Grisham, Michael Crichton"" catelogue of titles not available! You have got to be kidding. I also went to Borders to peruse books to buy on the Kindle, only to discover that 8 out 10 titles I desired were also not available.I wonder what books those 300,000 plus consist of. Not many that I have heard of.Had I known that most of the authors I like are not yet available on the Kindle, I would have waited.Before considering buying a Kindle, go the Amazon site, search for books that you would consider downloading and check that the book is available on the Kindle format. You may be very suprised"
5,My wife loves it,"My wife absolutely loves the device and reads it every night. She has an iPhone....reading books at the gym, on the airplane, or at home before she goes to bed is all on the Kindle and not the iPhone. And that's a fact!"
4,Like my Kindle,I enjoy that I can finish one book and start another book right away. I have authors that I really enjoy and I can scan previous books by the same author and down load any books that I have missed by that author.
4,Kindle,"I cannot give a review of how it works since this was a gift for friend in England. But since both my friend and I love reading and traveling, I thought that with the Kindle you have as many books with you when you want them."
4,Kindle,This is the most awesome invention ever. I love to read and usually only have time during school vacation time but now I can take this anywhere and read anytime I want. I received it just last month and am already on my 3rd book!!
1,poor search possibilities when difficulties remembering an exact author's name,"poor search possibilities when difficulties remembering an exact author's and very often a poor representation of the total work of a given author.400.000 titles may impress as a figure, but there is relatively few recent work by modern important authors.I am not all impressed by the quality of the bestsellers' list.in my opinion there is a lot to be done by amazon"
1,Disapointed,"The Kindle reader looked great and seemed to be just the thing for me. Unfortunately, my e-mail address was incorrectly recorded by Amazon as ending with "".com"" rather than "".ca"" so I spent many frustrating hours trying in vain to make it work. My son in law, who is a product demonstrator for Apple Computers was also unable to down load books. I sent it back and the error was discovered by an Amazon customer support staffer when I called for assistance in downloading the return shipping label. The whole experience has put me off e-readers in general, and Amazon in particular.Carolyn Fenn"
3,e book pricing a lie and rippoff,"I pretty much love everything about my new kindle 2, EXCEPT the misleading pricing of books.In all the advertising and Amazon information,it seems that books are $9.99.This is not true!!!!!!!!!!Most of the books I'm interested in,history and biographies are much more than the 9.99.I feel this is misleading by Amazon and ALL books should be one price."
3,Not a Family device,"We are a two Kindle family. Sounds great, or so we thought. But to trade Kindles to have access to my husband's books, is as easy as moving a bookcase. He is in the middle of two books, easily bookmarked as to his place, and is eager to have me read the book he just finished, BUT .... I HAVE NO ACCESS to this bookshelf.We were able to share the same Audible library with ease, just as if they were books on our shelf. This ""secret"" stash of books doesn't promote the interesting conversations about new ideas, interesting plots, and disturbing endings.I think we don't want to buy any more Kindle books, no matter how easy it is to download, until we can share them within our technical family.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
1,My Kendl was DOA,"I waited 2 years to buy this product. It arrived DEAD. I spent one hour with India technician listed in manual.Charged it all night. DEAD next morning. Spoke to tech support in Costa Rica. Determined Kendl was defective,said would overnight another one for Saturday delivery.Didn't happen.I am disappointed, angry and wondering if the next one will work?I live in an area where it cannot be downloaded to device so will have to be downloadedto computer then device. Hope this doesn't disappoint me as much as the inoperable one.Wish me luck. Has anyone else had this experience?"
5,Kindle,"I love my Kindle. Who would have thought that a ""more mature"" person could adjust to reading in this fashion so quickly?"
3,Kindle in Brazil,"I liked the product, but would like more Kindle books in the language of Brazil. This is unfortunate!"
2,Kindle.....,"Kindle impressed me in the first sight. However, when I received it, I can't read PDF file. Thanks to my friend who had one before, he told me to update the firmware, now my kindle can read PDF file. I was quite disappointed that why Amazon didn't inform user to update their firmware if it was available.I also find some software which enables my Kindle to read Chinese. Why Amazon I & R team didn't do it for Chinese user.Quite disappointed at all.."
5,Ebook Pricing,"I was deciding between a Nook from Barnes and Noble vs the Kindle. Here is the deal breaker, EBOOK PRICING!! I was reading the reviews and forums for both products and the decision maker was the pricing for the ebooks. Barnes and Noble charges 5x the amount of Amazon for thier ebooks. They charge the same for thier ebook as the hardcover! It's ridiculous and everyone on the Barnes and Noble site is complaining. It totally defeats the purpose of getting an elecronic reader, you are paying for an electronic file afterall. I give the Kindle 5 stars on ebook pricing alone. Amazon definitely has the market cornered on the pricing and book availability. Barnes and Noble not only charges 5x as much for the same book but they dont have as many books available for download. So if you are buying an electronic reader the Kindle is the way to go!"
2,"Okay, but not Great","Pros:1. You can download books wirelessly anywhere -- this is a smart feature.Cons:1. Very limited book selection2. No light - It is hard to read in any place but direct soon, so forget reading in bed without waking people (book lights do not help much because they do not clip on the kindle).3. Breaks easily. I am delicate person and the screen is broken and the case has a crack after just a few months.4. Contrast is low. The background is too gray and is not white like paper.5. No way to organize books -- if you have more than a few books you have to scroll through them all."
2,"Great Idea in theory, but too expensive!!","I had a kindle for about a minute and then realized that books are so much more economical. Amazon is really trying to charge people $369.00 and then at least $10 for each book? Give me a break!I agree that this is a great concept and it's very ideal for people with certain disabilities but overall, the only people that can afford this would generally not be likely people to buy it as they have no time to read anyway.I suggest Amazon bring down the price quite a bit and they'll see more sales."
1,The NEW new Kindle... your kidding right?,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Amazon.com is developing a new version of its Kindle e-book reader with a larger screen, according to a report on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal on Friday. The new device may come out in time for the 2009 holiday shopping season,This is NUTS... I just ordered a Kindle a week ago and now I find out all the glitches are getting fixed and the screne enlarged by Christmas."
1,kindle swindle,"I have owned my original Kindle for one year and one month and suddenly it has stopped working and I cannot access the books in my library. When I contacted amazon to ask them how they could fix this probablem for me they told me that they would be able to give me $180 toward a new Kindle 1 which is a great offer EXCEPT I paid full price for this gadget just a little over a year ago and now it's useless. So getting a huge discount on another one which might last a year seems like I would be throwing good money after bad. And it's a shame because I love the idea behind it, but I am now disillusioned with the whole package and I don't know that I would recommend it to others simply because the kindle is not inexpensive and if the technology isn't improved in succeeding generations then I would suspect that they will continue to be a fifty-fifty proposition."
3,"Faster, yes, but number of shortcomings","I purchased a Kindle 2 after breaking my original Kindle. I have been very disappointed in the changes made to the Kindle, namely the lack of exchangeable battery, the lack of a memory card slot, and the lack of a content manager, which made moving and removing multiple items a possibility. The new Kindle has none of those features, ones I sorely miss. Disappointing."
1,"Cover, where's the cover?","When I ordered a second Kindle 1, I was informed that I would be ""upgraded"" to a Kindle 2 without additional charges. Upon receipt of the Kindle 2 I noted that it was missing the leather cover that was included with the Kindle 1 when purchased. I contacted Amazon/Kindle, spoke with supervisor ""Tyler"" and was informed that the cover was not included in the purchase of the Kindle 2. I would have to spend additional money to get what was before part of the original purchase price. I would think that they would include the basic cover or a coupon to apply to the purchase of a cover of choice. I was only offered the option to return the Kindle 2 as the Kindle 1 is no longer in production. I was also informed I could buy a used Kindle 1 from various sources (rediculous suggestion). I am very displeased and until now held Amazon in high regard. This is clearly misrepresentation on their part and as a consumer I am very dissatified."
1,Thumbs down Amazon...not worth advertising.,I rarely buy anything without comparing with Amazon's price. There's no telling how much money I've spent at Amazon. Today is the first day that I have questioned this company. The Kindle sale wasn't worth advertising because it was a mirage for 99% of us out there. I want my time back. That was absurd. Don't toy with your customer loyalty next time Amazon.
3,OK hardware; software needs work!,"The claim that this thing can hold 1500 books is misleading. Yes, it has the digital storage space to do so... but it's the equivalent of tossing 1500 books into a big pile on the living room floor. Good luck finding what you need. Come on, Amazon, I'm sure your code monkeys can come up with some sort of rudimentary catalog/file/folder system."
4,"Love it, but it could use a couple enhancements","I love the convienence of my new Kindle. I travel a lot so it's been great not having to take big bulky books. There are a couple things I'd love to see Kindle incorporate. First, color but I know that means a new edition and I'm not going to spend another $250. The thing that Kindle could do immediately would be to add folder(s) feature. This way I could organize my books by authors or by series. I haven't read 20 books yet, but I can see how trying to keep them organized could become an issue, especially since Kindle claims it can hold up to 1500 books."
4,Kindle,Great product. Fun to have and was able to download a text for a class for less than half of the price that the book would have cost.
2,"Great concept, Big flaws",Good only for novels and books with very little visuals which you intend to read from begining to end in sequential manner.It is very easy to read text on Kindle. It is easy on eyes.Big flaws:1) Unable to jump to any page or chapter.2) Images and diagrams in books are hardly visible3) Poor controls
4,Kindel in Spain,"I was thinking of buying a Kindle 2 but I have just read in one of the reviews that to change th battery I would have to send it back to the U:S where they ( Amazon) would change the whole reader and I would loose all my contents. NO WAY. I also read that the feature that allows it to read to you is no longer available.NO WAY.I am afraid i will have to postpone buying one until something is done to facilitate our "" non american "" lives"
4,White weit wide board,I do not think that it is successfull to ask for the email address of the kindles female voice. Most of the SAPI voices I did not like. Please put the voice feature in an extra menu. And improve the search of kindle items. Perhaps it is possible to shrink the borders.Finally I have to say a kind device.A lot of kindliness ROLAND.
1,Books are not portable,I refuse to pay $9.99 to $15.00 for an electronic book that I will read one time and cannot pass on to any of my relatives or friends. A paper back book sells for a much lower price.
4,Kindle 2 better than 1,"I have found the Kindle 2 a upgrade from 1. I bought the Kindle 2 for thespeech reconition. I thought that was going to save me eye strain,I like to read before I go to bed. As it turns out I can only read for so long.I think speech has a ways to improve before I can recommend it. Kindle 2has improved, so I still think it is a good unit, I still have to see ifit is a great. I have had my Kindle 2 for about a month. Oh! I have neverread a whole book, until I got my Kindle 1 and now 2, today I have read 3books and am now reading books 4 and 5 over 50% read on both."
4,"Like it so far,","I only have this for about a month, read a few books on it. So far so good. It's great to travel with. Some of my friends thought the kindle is a bit pricey. But think of all the trees we are saving."
5,ADDICTED!!!,"I recently got the new Amazon Kindle 2 for my birthday and I LOVE it! I was an avid reader before, but now I read constantly! It is so wonderful that it fits right in my purse and that I can take it and read it practically anywhere! I just finished my second book in two weeks, which is a new record for me! The wonderful selection of books guarentees that I will never be without something good to read and the very ease of getting the latest releases is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone! By far one of the best birthday presents I have ever gotten!"
5,Beautiful piece of technology!,"The Kindle 2 is amazing! I had been eying the Kindle 1, and when the Kindle 2 came out, I immediately snatched it up. I LOVE IT! Everything is just as advertised! I find myself reading easier on the Kindle 2 than I do with a regular book. Simply astounding. The only draw back is that the internet browser is a little iffy, but it really doesn't hamper all of the other wonderful attributes of the device. Two thumbs up and recommended to anyone and everyone!"
4,Slick Tool,"I really like my Kindle. I am not a book reader, I purchased it to read newspapers while I travel or waiting for an appointment. The pricing for USA Today and WSJ are very appealing compared to the print edition. However, I am not sure if every story from the print edition make it the Kindle edition. This is why I canceled my subscription to the Seattle Times via Kindle.I hope they improve the browser. I realize it is just a test version, but its pretty slow to be useful.My one problem is that it is too easy to drop. It's too 'slick' hence the title of my review. If the edges were designed so it was easier to hold on to when carrying it, it would be perfect."
5,Kindle,"Love it! Only thing I would like to see is a better way to advance to a specific chapter, or section in the book, especially when the ""book"" may be a compilation of novellas and you may not want to read them all in the actual print order."
2,Disappointed in the Kindle,"My Kindle is only a month old and it won't power on - completely frozen. Perfect weekend enjoying my book and poof! Gone. Have to return tomorrow, but the time to enjoy is gone."
4,Kindle 2,"I am in love with this thing, I always loved reading, but I'm actually reading more now. I take it everywhere with me, it's excellent for when I'm waiting in line at the store, or waiting for an appointment. I can't get enough of it. I think it would make a great gift for kids who don't like reading, I believe that because kids love technology, this would motivate them to read more."
4,Kindle good for the road,"As a person who travels extensively in China, I usually carry eight to ten books on paper. This weighs less than even one, and I am assured that I will never run out of reading material no matter how long I am there. A wonderful device."
2,Selection,I understand I am going to be flamed for not owning the book and reviewing it BUT1. I like the machine and it's capability.2. I like the Idea that I can have all my book's available wherever I go.3. no problems with broken spines or musty smells.The problem is that I looked up my favorite author's and they are not there. Hmm unknown authors wouldn't be on you say? David Weber has 40-50 or so titles(search amazon 3299 results) but only has 2 books on Kindle. John Ringo is a no show.I would love to have the unit but until the selection improves there is no reason for me to purchase this.
1,Five reasons why Kindle is a Swindle,"Five reasons why Kindle is a Swindle:1. You don't control Kindle. Amazon controls it.2. You don't own your Kindle titles. You enter into a Kindle license for each title.3. Amazon can enter your Kindle and delete books at will. Google ""Amazon 1984"" for a recent example.4. Amazon changes the rules at will. Amazon sold thousands of Kindle titles with a ""read aloud"" feature they later disabled.5. Amazon refuses to explain the Digital Rights Management (DRM) system built into Kindle and what it does.What's next for Kindle? Amazon can do anything they want, whenever they want, with your Kindle. Your knowledge and permission aren't required. Demand your freedom to own and control the things you pay for, especially your books! Don't buy a Kindle!"
1,The Next Big Thing? NOT A CHANCE!,"The Kindle is the biggest waste of $300! WARNING: DO NOT BUY! If your considering it as a nice holiday gift...DON'T. It has lag and freezes more often than it works. Flip the page=2 hour wait. I would not recommend ever spending a cent on this cheap piece of junk. I feel very strong about not recommending any form of Amazon's Kindle. Sure, the idea is brilliant but Amazon has not perfected it yet. Give it a couple years... technology does improve. In fact, I'm looking forward to hearing more from another companies version of this product, which may or may not be on the market soon. But for now save $300 buy yourself something more efficent. Oh, and hears an idea buy yourself a book and flip the page the old fashioned way...at least then you won't have to worry about ""virus malfunction"" and changing the batteries. Just do yourself a favor, save yourself a bundle, and DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Kindle 2,"I received my Kindle 2 this week and was really excited to see what it offered. I AM REALLY DISSAPOINTED in the text to speach. It doesn't sound right . For exaple ""ahhh"" was pronounced A A A HHHHHH . It was odd"
2,"NO FREE BOOKS, HAVE TO BUY EXCLUSIVELY FROM K","WITH SOME OF THE OTHER EREADERS, THERE ARE TONS OF FREE BOOKS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE DEVISE SELLER. WITH KINDLE, NO FREE BOOKS, NO LIBRARY ACCESS AND I WOULD HAVE TO BUY ONLY FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY. WITH NOOK(B&N), I HAVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED THEIR EREADER TO MY COMPUTER AND AM READING FREE EBOOKS AND OTHERS FROM MY COMPUTER WITHOUT AN EREADER. IF MY LIBRARY PARTICIPATED IN EPUB, I COULD CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM MY COMPUTER WITH THE FREE SONY PC DOWNLOAD. UNFORTUNATELY EPUB IS NOT IN EVERY LIBRARY YET."
5,Kindle,My Kindle has added so much to my reading. I just love that I can order immediately and have a book to read so quickly!
2,Kindle for Canadians,"I need to hear from Canadians who use the new kindle 3.Can you download books from any country?I understand we have a very limited list of books and we like bestsellers - will be be disappointed?We spend part of the year in the US and part of it in S. America and Europe and would have to be able to download from anywhere, the books.When investigating the Nook, we were told we could not download books unless we were physically in the USA which means we can't download say, in England.Anyone who can help me - it would be appreciated."
5,amazing!,I love this thing I didnt like buying book before because when I was donr with them I had no where to put them with this there is no problem because they are stored in the kindle. So glad my boyfriend bought this for me. I use it everyday!
4,Love my kindle!,"I LOVE this thing! I travel a lot and hated to always tote books on plane with me. Now I just download and slip this in my purse/bag and what convenience. The only bad thing is that after I purchase this for $249, the price went down to about $150 and new version came out. Bummer. May have to hand it down to my husband and buy me the newer version. Specific things I like: Text sizes help my aging eyes to read without glasses. Convenience is basic. Specific things I don't like so much: Can't get my arms around the bookmarks. It seems I set a bookmark and then can't figure out how to get back to that place. Also tried some kids books on it, but not good for those. Pictures are not clear. In fact graphics and diagrams are not the best viewed on Kindle. Hey, maybe they should come up with a kindle version in color for kids! Anyway, even with drawbacks I still love it!"
5,Jo Black,I love to read and I read alot. I totally LOVE my Kindle. I love the fact that I can instantly recieve a book. One thing that I also love is that I can put my pdfs on it. I converted all my recipes to pdfs and now my Kindle is also my Persoanl COOKBOOK -- how awesome is that??
5,Love My Kindle!,I've had my kindle for over 6 months now and I just love it! It's so easy to read and I don't miss regular books at all. I use it everyday and the battery life lasts a good two weeks without having to charge again. I am so glad I purchased and I will continue to recommend this to my friends.
1,Excellent 10 year old piece of technology,"If you have never seen a computer or a cell phone this is a great. If you have actually noticed something called a laptop for sale somewhere this is quite underwhelming. Small screen with no resolution, no ability to change contrast or luminosity, no backlight, so you can't use it in low light. Great improvement with the 1.5 gig worth of memory, except that my phone as 8 gig of memory in a 10th of the space and at half of the price. I don't see why this should cost more than 100$, given that has limited use (can be used only for text, figures are OK if it is a book on how to hetch a sketch)"
3,Strange,This thing only has one page so how can you read a whole book on it? Most grownups like to read things that are longer than one page... I guess this product must be for kids and those with short attention spans.
1,Too expensive,"Hi, if you give us 200 free books to download over one year, we'll buy your product! It's very special, and so seductive to readers who crave technology. But...the price tag is high as the book download market and legal situation hasn't stablized. I also think there is new technological features to be mined and included in a product to read with. So, for the time being, I will use the old technology and the laptop to satisfy. You know I'll be watching you tho!!!"
1,Millennium Fahrenheit,"Wow! Yet another geekoid device to further distance ones self from social interaction. No need to go to the book store, library or news stand. Huddle in yet another cubicle of self induced isolation, paranoia and human disconnection. In addition, any individual who often uses the ubiquitous noun ""love"" to quantify their use of an inanimate electronic device is in need of therapy. BTW, Sony now has two new readers that out-spec the newest-g kindle. However, the socio-opine applies to any such device."
2,Kindle _Not an e-reader,"Well, it is now time to sell this Kindle I paid $300 for, and get an E-Reader to download books from the library. Unless Kindal comes up with something very soon, no one should purchase one of these. Get an e-reader, and downlaod the books for free from a library.Thanks"
5,Glad I Bought It!,"I love to learn and read. However, I cannot tell you the many books I have bought on amazon with the intent to read and enjoy and never did for various reasons.I have had the Kindle for less than a week and I have done more reading in this time then in the past 6 months. It truly has Re-Kindled my enjoyment of reading and learning. I keep it near and whenever a few momments present themselves I can escape in my ready.I highly recommend the Kindle for the one who wants to Re-Kindle the passion of reading , but life gets in the way."
2,Watch out - this is very fragile!,"Be careful if you want to buy this. If you drop you are done -- it will not work. It's 10X more fragile than your cell phone or BlackBerry, so don't think you can afford to treat it in any way except like your most precious, heirloom crystal! I would not buy it again."
1,Way too delicate,Dropped Kindle (in a protective case) from 12 inches and screen broke. Way too delicate for a portable device. Amazon charges two hundred dollars for a screen repair to ship you a refurbished kindle (which is pathetic considering they just dropped prices of brand new devices). The poor durability and outlandish repair cost drop this to a 1 star.
1,A waste of money,"Amazon can take back the books you buy. As wonderful as it is to have access to books like this the fact that at any moment you can loose a book you're in the middle of enjoying is horrible. Yes you get your money back, but I wouldn't want people from Amazon breaking into my house in the middle of the night taking products I paid for and leaving a check on my coffee table. It's the same thing."
1,Disappointment,"I've recently bought my wife a Kindle. I thought I was buying her a better e-reader than her sister's Nook. Within a few days I regretted my choice. The Nook has email application, not the Kindle. Some popular books, such as the recently published ""Dead in the Family"", is available to Nook's readers but not to Kindle's. In reponse to my complaint to Amazon, I have received the following response:""I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused....we don't have information as to when is email going to be made available on Kindle...I've checked the Kindle store and see that ""Dead in the Family"" is not available for Kindle. However, your direct feedback to the publisher is helpful"".Think before you buy Kindle. Perhaps Nook is a preferable e-reader for you.iazar@rcn.com"
3,Excited but a bit confused by Kindle 2,"I have just received my Kindle 2 - my first experience of an electronic book reader - after recommendation from a friend. The design is great, lightweight and I really don't notice I am holding it when I am reading (i.e. it doesn't feel any different from a book). One thing that did take some getting used to was the screen flash when you turn a page - but again as a ""newbie"" I imagine most people don't even notice this. The one thing that is really frustrating though is the fact that words are hyphenated when they don't need to be and paragraphs are indented or some lines stop half way along and then carry on on the next line. Not sure if this is specific to my Kindle or just an unavoidable part of the e-reading experience."
3,Kindle Review,"I actually purchased as a gift for someone else. The individual seems to really like it, but they are still trying to get the hang of using it. (Now 2 months). The owner of the Kindle doesn't own a computer, which makes it hard without the ""hard copy"" of a very ""thick"" manual. Too bad it didn't come with a hard copy. Actually Kindle should have given the owner the opportunity (postcard or telephone number enclosed) to request for a ""hard copy"" if they don't own a computer."
5,"love,love,love my new kindle","Hiya,out there just got my new kindle 2ed gen.. and I love it. now i'm not a techi person ,but as soon as it arrived I plugged it in , and away I went ordering 15 books with one click. I read a lot so the prices on the books are better then with my barns & noble discount card. I will take this unit with me everywhere, I love,love, love it. So worth the $299.00 investment.... So if your a reader like me, you will love your kindle, I also got the leather book cover on sale so fab and rich feeling..To all me fellow readers out there this kindle is going to make it a great winter, full of reading..happy days..lorrie"
4,Just a practical thing,"The great point about the Kindle is that it offers just what you expect. Great readability, (relative) usability, good capacity, good battery life... isn't that a good e-book?On the not-so-clear side, I think it should be easier to charge with books not bought in Amazon. But it is not."
5,Kindle: a real EBOOK not a computer that try to simulate it,"I own a Kindle 6"" display since 2 monthes now, here is my little review:It took only minutes to understand how it works: it is EASYThe paper look helps to consider it as A BOOK NOT A COMPUTERThe battery is never empty, I fill it only once a week. (remember to switch off the wireless)All my friends are amazed by the ""paper look"" of my Kindle.Now I like to have my kindle handy to continue my favorite reading.I use the Kindle opportunity to reopen a bunch of old French books... they fill all in it!Some improvements needed for the next version:- a light that can be switched on sometimes- The screen should be 2 centimers wider to have the same surface as a pocket book.If you are elder than 50 years you will understand.- ...because the PDF files cannot be zoomed in. Turn the page 90 helps but...- I would love to have a small clock near the page number. When I am reading I forget easily everything!- French Wikipedia support? SD card?"
5,Read when you move,"Howdy,This Kindle is amazing. With a few other safeguards it's even better! Now to find a few more dollars to get the DX...."
4,price drop smarts,"$159 price drop on the 6"" Kindle. That smarts. I wouldn't complain about a drop of up to $50, but this really is a blow. You could at least GIVE us purchasers a discount on SOME books, to make up for the drastic price drop. That would only be fair. I still enjoy using my Kindle, and from the reviews I've read, I am better off with the 6"" model [generation 2] than the 3rd generation, larger Kindle. I hope someone reads this and gives us some sort of break."
2,Delivery Coverage,"The only negative issue I have with my Kindle is its delivery system--a service not available in my home area. The internet must be used to download and transfer a book (and I don't even want to think about getting blogs, newspapers, or magazines this way). Although this process for books is simple, it defeats the purpose of ownership.The Kindle could be is a great device to own--if you live in a coverage area. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading my first book on it. It is easy to read and much less cumbersome than printed books. Should coverage expand, offering service in my area, my rating would be much higher.If you live in a coverage area, you will love the Kindle. Without it, it's a bust."
4,Very nice but...,Very nice but small issues like 1) connection to charger can be easily bent... we already have some damages 2) keyboard button is too small to push...
4,Great gadget for old lady,"I'm not much for new gadgets. But this one is just great even for an old lady like me. I love reading. And, I love that I can just put this in a reasonably sized purse and take it with me. I can have it with me when I'm waiting in the doctor's office, standing on a long line at the grocery store, being a passenger in a car for a long trip, and all sorts of other places where it would be difficult to carry books. My husband loves that he can read the NY Times and other periodicals while he waits for me somewhere. I'm still learning how to use it quickly, but it is very intuitive and more easily learned than many other gadgets I've been exposed to (by my kids). I'll wait until the voice and sound are really a more functional part of it, but even without that, I'm very happy about the purchase."
4,Pretty easy to use the Kindle,"The Kindle was pretty easy to use the 1st time, though finding and getting to the ""free"" titles on Amazon took a little searching and a little time. However, I did find many free titles of excellent literature besides all the $10 more current titles. I do thank Amazon for refunding the difference between my approx $250 purchase price and the new $189 price. I received an email ad trumpeting the new reduced Kindle price about a week after I bought it; needless to say that didn't make me happy. However, after an email to Kindle support, Amazon immediately (and cheerfully, if that's possible by email) agreed to refund the difference, which they did that same day. I expect this device will get lots of family use."
4,Love It!,I love my Kindle. It is so easy to read and very easy to order books. The only thing I do not like is the cost of some of the books is a little expensive. Older books are $10 but the newer books are $13 which is pretty close to what you can buy them for at Sam's Club.
5,Love my Kindle,We now have two Kindles in our family and we both love the Kindle. Instead of hearing pages turn as we read we hear clicking sounds as we read. Love the ability to select your own print size and not having to hold a large book while you read. This is one advancement in technology we are really enjoying. Coould recommend it more highly.
5,wonderful,"easy to learn, to use, to download books. Great for traveling, no more hauling a suitcase full of heavy books. love the dictionary feature."
4,Great Device,"I love my kindle. Love the fact that I can take it anywhere and buy books whenever I want. And the price of them only makes it better. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is very disappointing that Amazon did not offer recent Kindle 2 (US) buyers the option to get international access somehow. I bought my Kindle a couple of months ago and now, not only did they lower the price, but also included international access.Apart from that little thing, the Kindle 2 is an amazing product."
5,My Kindle,"I absolutely love my Kindle!!! I am a senior citizen and have alwasys been an avid reader. This allows me to purchase books and not have them take up space (a major complaint of my husband). I know that there will be times when I will purchase or receive a regular book, but the Kindle give me the ease of storage unknown of before. I can carry it anywhere in my purse and it doesn't run the risk of being left behind because I simply store it. Thanks, Amazon for this item."
5,Love my Kindle,The only thing I would change or update is the read/voice text option. If this becomes a regulated and prominent feature for all texts and comes acrss more smoothly then it will be perfect.I have used it everday since I bought it and I couldn't be happier.
3,Really mad,It was just a matter of a few weeks after I paid $289 for my Kindle that you started selling even better ones for half the price. I feel this was bad business on your behalf.
2,"18 months later, it breaks and now no warranty!!!","After purchasing this or my wies birthday in May 2009, the kindle finaly tonight just gets a these lines on the screen and breaks. We called tech support and they wanted $89 to ix this Kindle, which I paid $359 for in May of 2009. Now it sells for $189-$139 new.They really shoud have had a 2 year warranty at least. Very unfair on multiple levels- price dropped plus the Kindle is now broken and it costs money to ship and fix it when it should not just go on you like that.BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Kindle Short comings,"Kindle is OK but if you read allot it does get expensive.Seems like the books I want are always the $12 not the $10.Battery does not last over 2-3 days.You cannot read at night or in low light unless you get a book light, which is a pain.The only display option is black & white.The display is perfect in full sun.They need to have a color display option and a built in book light."
5,Absolutely fantastic!!!!,"The Kindle WRD is an exceptional piece of technique! If you love to read this is the perfect gift to yourself. I've been nothing but satisfied with this product and really enjoy the immediate shopping options for more reading material. The wireless connection works nonstop, the handling is super easy. Two thumbs up!!!!"
4,A great transition to wireless reading,"I thought the best app for the Kindle2 would be books, but I was dissappointed that most Kindle books are priced equivalent to the hard copy editions. The same problem with magazines, only they are more expensive than the subscription price!What I did discover is a savings in ordering newspapers, especially international editions. So, this is what I am using my Kindle for.I would like a bigger screen, like the DX, however, my research indicates there is no left hand controls and the print is in one column, which can get very hard on the eyes. For the price difference of $189, I decided the Kindle was the better of the two.I do wish they would do something about the search mechanisms. When you are paging through headlines and select a story and then return to the menu, you have to start from the first story again, rather than resume where you left off.Overall, I am enjoying my Kindle2."
1,Amazon should not have the right to delete purchased books,"I was toying with the idea of buying a Kindle 2 while waiting to see what BeBook II would look like. But now that Amazon has shown that it has the right to delete books from your library, I will not choose a Kindle. (The fact that Amazon refunds the purchase price has no bearing on my right as a reader to own books.)"
4,Really makes my drive to work more pleasant...,"I drive about an hour to and from work every day, and Ive always been so bored. You can only listen to talk radio so long. I got this last month as an early Xmas gift, and I've already ready 3 books! And I only read while I'm driving to and from work!I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a lengthy commute..."
4,Best product ever invented!,"Love LOVE LOVE IT!!! The dictionary functionality is great for learning new vocabularies. The eInk technology won't hurt your eyes. It's so compact that I can hurry around in my bag everywhere. The battery with the wireless on lasts about a week if you read few hours a day. With the wireless off, it's about three weeks if you read few hours a day. The only thing I don't like about it is the 5-way joystick...it's a real pain to use it. I would say that is the only thing Amazon would need to improve on for going forward. It also doesn't support any other characters besides the alphabet (something else they need to improve on). The MP3 player plays music at random and you can't see the list of songs you imported. You can kind of surf the web but you will only see the text the web has to display. Definitely get the case with it or else the surface of your Kindle will be scratched!"
4,Gift For An Avid Reader,"I bought this for my wife who is an avid reader. I had bought her a Sony e-reader 3 years ago, she used that almost every day, this replaces that product. The 100 fold increased access to content is the main reason for the switch, no more computer downloads then transfer to e-reader.Though it may not be perfect, it is brilliant, we love it, bought a nice red leather cover (a bit heavy she says, she removes it sometimes).Amazon refunded my $50 when the price dropped a week after I bought it.It was lost by USPS in shipping so Amazon over-nighted a replacement. Thats great customer service!Though you can review this device endlessly, the only point I will make is that going from page 1 to page 162 or jumping forward many pages, is a bit of a slow process.It is well worth $299 to an avid book reader, she uses it ever day, the amount of available content and ease of purchasing it is awesome!"
5,great!,I got the Kindle 2 in July for my birthday. I absolutely love it! The battery lasts a long time. The use of the Kindle Store is very easy. The use of the Kindle is very easy. I love the experimental settings with the internet and the mp3's. And I also love the text-to-speech setting. As I can use this when traveling since I get car sick reading in a car. I can be in the middle of no where and get service with it. I also like that i can access internet and send off a quick email. I love that I can change the size of the text. Basically I love this device. One of the best investments I have evemade! I would recomend this to anyone!
3,Kindle 2 -experiences,"Have got acquainted with my sweet Kindle for a while now and have some comments to point out.- Excellent for a person who travels a lot! Thousands of books in one cover, what could be more brilliant than that?- Excellent for a student, same reason as above, with a frosting of dictionaries available etc.- Excellent screen for reading even in a bright sun shine!- Superexcellent for Americans but I in Finland can not order e.g. magazines WITH photos, due to copyrights, that sucks.- I as an European (or just Finnish?) user don't have access to the web, only to Amazon.com.- The apparatus should have a built-in light in it.All in all I'm all for it, HAPPY KINDLING!!! <3"
3,Reading device use frustrating but satisfying,"The Kindle Wireless Reading Device provides excellent reading material with adequate contrast and readable type. Size of printed material is easily adjusted. Ordering and installing books, papers, is easy.The search for specific books does not seem to be comprehensive with many searches drawing blanks. This may be due to inexperience with the system.The Device is not robust. I had to return two devices before I got one that worked. Fortunately procedures for the return and replacement of the device are easy, clearly explained, and rapid with two day service."
3,Kindle review,Kindle purchased for a gift. Recipient happy with the Kindle. Not so easy to get accessories shipped to Melbourne Australia. Would be good to also have colour kindle. Price point is not too bad but other companies coming out with more intuitive devices with more features for less money.Happy with the books available on the Kindle.
3,The battery indicator,My wife loves her birthday present. But the battery indiccator appears not to be workingcorretly. Will keep it another wee nd see how itisdoingmaybesenditbackforothre.
1,"One hand gives, one hand takes away.","What are you buying when you buy this product? Apparently only the right to purchase temporary files at a price Amazon sets, and to use them only in ""approved"" ways. This is not a good use of my time or my money. If I have to drop a few hundred dollars to look good, I'd rather have a full-day hair, massage, and makeover session at a really fancy salon. And I'll take a BOOK."
1,Danger!!,"My wife got her Kindle 2 last week. Neither of us are exactly computer experts. While trying to adjust the font size and change the registered owner, because it was a gift, she accidentally ordered a book! She called and they gladly removed it. The other day, my son, who is 16 and very technically inclined, accidentally ordered a book also! Here on Amazon, it is very difficult to purchase anything by accident. When I asked the phone rep about removing the credit card info so that it would have to be entered every time, they said that it wasnt possible. When I asked about having it ask for a password, like here on Amazon, I was told that was also not possible. When I asked about password protecting the Kindle, like our laptop, again, not possible. Does anyone else see this as a problem? She hasnt really tried to actually read a book on it yet, so we cant comment on how it works. I can say that for $359, it should have included a case and a light. All in all, so far, not great."
1,a kindle: to burn books with...,"wow.. it couldn't be more convinced that this is evil... but to call it kindle? that just adds insult to injury...I heard a college in san franscisco say he'll never read another book again except for on kindle. In fact if a book isn't available on kindle and especially if it's not available on kindle, he would never read it until it...This is sustainable, how?"
3,Kindle2,"I think it is a great device, probably the wave of the future, and I'd buy one, but they are way over priced, and the price to download books to expensive, also you have to buy all new accessories because of the change in size. I will buy one someday, when the price becomes more reasonable, and they work out all the bugs!!!! Good luck guys....."
5,Kindle,Kindle is easy to use. Easy to download books. Nice to have so many books at ones fingertips.
5,Kindle 2,I'm totally in love with my Kindle 2. It's the greatest thing ever and all my friends are very envious.
5,Kindle #2,"This is our second Kindle. I enjoy mine so much that I purchased one for my wife. It is easy to use, convenient, and innovational. We can easily share books,even reading them at the same time! The vast number of titles and periodicals availabe is amazing. I recommend Kindle to any one who enjoys reading. It's addictive!"
3,Kindle,"The Kindle works as advertised for reading books & magazines, although the magazine offerings are skimpy.The Kindle DOES connect to the Web, but the functionaity is limited due to the screen format."
4,Love my kindle,"Kindle is great, the only thing that would elevate to five stars is a USB memory card slot..."
4,Kindle Book Reader,"This is amazing! I thought it was very expensive but in a world where you are wanting to downsize - imagine a 1500-book library in this one little device. Wow!I carry it with me everywhere and read every chance I get. I really like the ability to save particular sentences and also take notes. I purchased the Bible and can study, look up scripture, and take notes all on the same device.The only change I would recommend is it being backlit. That would really be helpful at night. Thanks for a great product!!"
5,Great Product,I've had it a whole month and can't find anything bad about it. It was my birthday present to myself. The screen is very clear and easy to see. I have the Kindle app on my iPod but this is so much nicer to read books on. I really really love it.
4,Love it!,"I love my Kindle. My only complaint is that, for me, it would be better to have the page turner buttons higher up on the device. I tend to hold it with my hands toward the top of the kindle & it would be more convenient if the page turners were closer to where I hold it. Perhaps, having one of the page turners closer to the top, & leaving the other one where it is, would be an improvement?"
4,Kindle Lover!!!,"I absolutely adore my kindle.Myself, I am an avid book reader, and was spending upwards of $100.00 a month on books... Since getting my kindle that has reduced by more than half. I've not only gotten novels that I love, but I've gotten my school text books, and a lot more cheaply than I would've at the college book store.The kindle is easy to use, and has no complicated features that require you to study-up on.The only gripe I have with the kindle at all is the experimental features. I would LOVE to have a full functioning web browser on my kindle, and I HOPE that when it is made a permanent feature I'll be able to download it to my kindle or something.Overall this product is amazing. I feel that it will truly transform how people read."
5,Kudos for the Kindle,"My husband and I each bought a Kindle. We are avid readers and travelers, packing many books for our trips. With the Kindle we only pack that 1 item.... and have a whole library at our disposal. How great is that?My husband was hospitalized recently & we packed both Kindles since I was staying with him. A friend visited bringing a heavy bag filled with books. We took the bag, of course, thanking her for her trouble. After she left we laughed at how heavy the book bag was and how light the Kindles are!"
3,Not Perfect...Yet,"Great idea, but I have a few of suggestions:A larger screen would be nice and a feature to allow a person to jump to different pages without the boring task of turning each page seperately would be great (try that with War and Peace). The product is still somewhat cumbersome in this respect. You dont have the freedom to skip about at your pleasure as with a real book.The newspaper feature I found even more troublesome. Only a few selected news features are available with no comics, no weather reports, no front page set-up. It dosent feel or appearance of a newspaper. I used it one day and forever deleted that service."
4,Very Pleased,Overall great product and great. It does lack some of the latest tech options but a basic clean ez to use item. the battery life is great as well. I got the smaller screen which is ez to carry and take a long.
4,Kindle Next Generation,It would be nice that it have an internal light. It's a wonderful lightweight product that fits anywhere. It offers many free downloadable books and others at a decent price.
4,"Review of Kindle 6""","I love everything about it. However, I inadvertently buy books if my finger slips on the BUY button. There should be another confirmation button before executing."
4,Kindle 2,"I've now read 3 books plus a few short guides on the K2. I wasn't quite sure how I'd adapt to the format, but I've found I like it quite well. The viewing angle is amazing--there is no angle of reading that makes the text get fuzzy. There is a learning curve especially finding the different menu choices. I believe in most cases it is superior to a printed book especially given the built in dictionary and light weight. You can download ""War and Peace"" and the K2 gains no weight! Two major improvements would be greater contrast, true black on white as opposed to black on pale green. The second would be the addition of folders so books could be organized by category. While great for books, the K2 doesn't work well with magazines or pubs with a lot of photo or graphic content."
1,Won't Buy One Until DRM Removed,"I spend a lot of money at Amazon. But I won't be spending money on a Kindle until Amazon removes DRM or any type of intrusive control over content from the device. Their capability and demonstrated behavior is EXACTLY the same as if Barnes & Noble sold you a book, then broke into your house and took it back, albeit leaving you a check on the bookshelf. You bought the book, it's yours. It's no one's right to take it back from you without asking you first, and then they should have no right to even install the capability of taking it back if you refuse. It's just one step from that to the government banning a book, then forcing Amazon to delete it from all Kindles. In our current political progression towards socialism in the U.S., this is a highly likely scenario.This behavior needs to stop entirely, and many organizations are working very hard to do just that. That's where my money for the Kindle is going."
1,Terribly disappointed,I bought a Kindle for my son's birthday and as a father's day present. I am terribly disappointed and upset that I was not told that it doesn't work in Canada where he lives. I believe it borders on misrepresentation.
2,Mac / iPhone Users - Take Note,"OK, I was ready to be blown away by this. Wanted it for my travels, and for my folks. 10 minutes into starting it up and turning it on - I had decided to return it. I was so impressed by the sell job and all the great reviews, but as a long time Mac and iPhone user, this device simply feels clunky and slow, and frankly, somewhat awkward. Getting around the settings was slow and a pain in the tushy, the screen flashes too much when you change pages - very distracting. True, it is better once you have a book or newspaper you can read through, but this is so far off of where it could be if they just made a much larger iPod Touch-type of reader. Really, what a huge disappointment."
3,Kindle nice but not yet great.,"I received my Kindle 1 in August of last year. I found it a bit on the klunky side but found great enjoyment out of downloading my favorite authors to my Kindle and being able to read immediately. Another big plus was the discount of Kindle books compared to hard copy books. This is not true any more. The cost of Kindle wireless books are increasing in price where they are now costing the same as hard copy books. This is really unacceptable. I have no plans to upgrade to the Kindle 2 due to the cost involved, and they have not yet upgraded the device enough to make it worth while to spend that kind of money. No color choices, not back lit so you can read without a book light, no additional memory can be added to just name a few. Cell phones offer more in some ways than the Kindle and is less expensive. On the plus side it is still nice to be able to have hundreds of book at the touch of my fingertips in one device."
2,disappointment,i am disappointed with this product.it does not allow me to do all the things that can be done in the usa.on second thoughts i would probably look at the sonny e reader before buying a kindle. i think that you are probably guilty of false advertising.
1,Would love to own two of them...,"I would buy two today for my wife and myself, but won't be taken in by the horrid ""Rights Management"" and the fact that I will not: be able to read it on other devices; be able to hear audio in certain books and that books can be pulled off my reader. Amazon can't learn from the DRM free Itunes? Is this so hard? For now I'll wait to hope to hear better from the Barnes and Nobles crowd, and if I don't, next step will be Sony. Thanks for nothing Amazon."
1,The price of a Kindle?,"While ebook readers are a very attractive concept, the Kindle in itself is deeply flawed by the facts that you can only purchase the books from the Amazon bookstore, that the books you are purchasing there are not your property but considered parts of a service, and that the service agreement is - you guessed it - totally biased to Amazon and alienating your liberties as a customers.When purchasing a Kindle book, you cannot read it on another device, nor can you share it with friends, donate it or sell it. If Amazon stops the Kindle service for any reason, the Kindle device and all purchased books will become totally useless and Amazon will have no liability whatsoever as clearly stated in the Kindle terms of service. And finally, Amazon reserves the right to remotely delete without your consent any books you have legally purchased on the device - and did so in the past on more than one occasion.Is freedom the price you want to pay for a Kindle?"
5,Lightning fast up and running,I purchased the Kindle for a nephew heading to Afganistan with the Army. I was downloading books within 60 seconds of turning Kindle on. It's as easy as using Itunes. Great product. SA
5,Didn't know what I was missing,"I just love this ereader. I didn't realize how incredible it was to be able to carry my books around to be able to read at my convenience. I travel a lot and the weight of books in my luggage kept me running in the direction of overweight charges. This has eased all of that stress, yet allowed me to have my favorite pass time when I have free moments. Thanks so much for this innovative product."
5,Very nice product!,"I bought the Kindle for my wife's birthday and she really loves it.Since the Kindle is hers, I have only played around with it but it seems to be very well built and I like the features.Yes, I will be buying one for myself in the very near future!"
4,The New Age Book,"As a person who has many thousands of books displayed in all the rooms of my house except the bathroom and the kitchen I was running out of room to display the books I have read and collected since my childhood. I'm now 62 and read up to 100 novels a year. I purchased this Kindle and at first I felt weird reading on a hand held device but as time went on I started to love it. I even took it to the beach and found that the bright sun posed no problem whatsoever. In the first two weeks that I've had the Kindle I've ordered three books (wirelessly, which is a marvel to me) and I will continue to due so. The e-books are inexpensive and the Kindle will pay for itself in no time. I've been reading for over two weeks and have not had to recharge the battery as of yet. All in all it's a great product and I love it. This old book reader loves it and I recommend that everyone try reading books this way. You'll love it.Bryan De Vouge"
3,Buttons too small-text to speech too fast,"I purchased the kindle 2 for my mother after she suffered a stroke. I was hoping she could continue to ""read"" by listening to audio books or the text to speech feature. What I found was the buttons are too small for her or my father to operate easily. The slide on power button is especially disappointing. Very difficult to see and turn on. It would be better if it was more like a toggle switch. The 5-way cursor button is also difficult to use. I thought the kindle would be easier to use than an mp3 player and it is but I think she may have been better off with books on CD.The text to speech is too fast for her to follow. At the end of each paragraph the computer says ""point"" but does not pause like you would expect at the end of a paragraph--in fact there is a longer pause for a comma than for a paragraph.I think it is very cool and easy to use however it doesn't meet my expectations for my mom."
1,Faulty Kindle 2 power cable,"Like the 200+ purchasers who previously left feedback on the power cable for the Kindle two, all of the insulation is falling off my Kindle power cable. Is there any recourse for me other than purchasing a new power cable which will probably do the same thing? This was obviously a defective product."
2,poor parental security options,"All those times that I thought my 12 year old daughter was in her room reading on her Kindle, I was so excited that she was finally happy to read. I thought this Kindle thing was like magic for a kid who was never really interested in reading. However, I just realized that she was able to connect to social networking sites, and carrying on conversations via the internet. When I called customer service to ask about parental controls to prevent these activities, I was told I was out of luck. Very dissapointing, Kindle."
5,wonderful product,"The new kindle is a wonderful book reader. My husband and I travel and love to read, so it is very convenient to have a kindle to take with us. This one was a present for my hubby since he wanted to borrow mine."
5,Best purchase!,"Anyone who loves to read needs to have a kindle. It saves money, trips to the store and trying to find places for all your books. There is nothing to NOT like about a Kindle. I would have to say my favorite feature is the Dictionary =).I would however, recommend the smaller version, it's much easier to carry around and hold. Much more like a real book than the larger one."
3,great idea,"It's too flimsy. I know they want it to be light, but I think they went too far. Other than that, it's outstanding."
1,No back light which was why I ordered it in the first place!,"I thought this would be a great thing to have because I read a lot of ebooks on my palm pilot and thought this would be better with all the features. Well, the ONE feature that it doesn't have is a back light! I couldn't believe it. I like to read in bed but have to find reading glasses and a reading light hence my palm pilot. Have a hard time reading books for this reason...hey, I'm 62, what can I say? Anyway, there is NO backlight on the kindle. What a disappointment! When they get one, I will consider buying one and keeping it."
3,dudded - by 2 weeks!,"I purchased my Kindle white 2nd gen 2 weeks before the new version came out - if I knew this was coming I would have waited as the new one, which is much better, costs the same as my 2nd gen white one!"
1,Amazon Kindle is a BIG disappointment!,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED! I bought the Kindle in April and it stopped working properly in August!!! I will NOT recommend this to anyone.
3,unavailable,"I HAVE FOUND THERE ARE A LOT OF BOOKS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE THE PRICE IS NOT VERY GOOD ON A LOT OF BOOKS. ALSO WIRELESS IS NOT AS QUICK AS YOU SAY, READING FROM THE KINDLE IS GREAT. I HAVE THE 2ND GENERATION KINDLE WUOLD LOVE HAVE 3G BUT i'M NOT AWARE IF I DO. JUST BOUGHT MY KINDLE FEW MOUTHS BACK I'M THINKING BUYING THE BARNES AND NOBLE READER IT HAS A FEW MORE PERKS THAT THE KINDLE DOESN'T THANK YOU"
5,What's not to love?,"I purchased the Kindle 2 after much thought, research, and gut-checking over the price. I have been an avid reader most of my life, and have always adored books and bookstores. I suffered much trepidation over purchasing a non-book to read books on. I have to say now that I've had my Kindle 2 for a week and a half that I've done everything with it that I do with a book and have found that there is nothing I don't like about it, and a few things I even love about the Kindle 2 more than a book. As someone who loves sitting outside with a book, I often found myself blinded in direct sunlight, but with the Kindle there's no problem. I have only had to deal with glare a few times, and that was with fluorescent lighting at work. Navigation, shopping, searching, and reading are very easy and fluid. I have noticed no lag, and connection is fast. Books in under a minute without driving to a store? Books without outdoor readers' blindness? What's not to love?"
5,Kindle,"Since the day I received my Kindle there hasn't been a day that I haven't picked it up to use it.It's light and comfortable in the hands and so easy to read, ordering is just a push of a button, what could be more easy than that and I don't have to find the time to go to the shops to get a new book. I love my kindle, it's one of the best purchases I have ever made."
3,It will get better.,"The good --The kindle is convenient and easy to use. It loads quickly. I like the size. The not so good -- The contrast between page and words is not bright enough for my reading comfort and I wish I could adjust it. The small book suggestions at the bottom of the page are too small to see. My daughter accidentally bought a book that I didn't want and I couldn't return it. I have found several typos in the book I'm reading, what is that about? Another book has type that is not sharp and clean, therefore, difficult to read -- like a bad scan of the page. The voice reader is creepy. I am certain that later versions will be better."
3,Not enough children/young adult books,"Kindle idea = great,Kindle book availability for avid child reader = poor.Daughter, age 11, has been searching for (fairly popular) authors and found that most books (not just the newly released) are not on Kindle: ""Surviving the Applewhites"" by Stephanie S. Tolan, any ""Artemis Fowl"" by Eoin Colfer, any ""Gilda Joyce by Jennifer Allison, any ""The Sisters Grimm"" by Michael Buckley...Unfortunately, this list goes on and on and on.We bought it for her because it is a tremendous space saver for the library she reads (we're lovers of books), and because Kindle allows her to adjust the font larger - (she needs glasses). MOST unfortunately, we did not conduct enough research to find out if Kindle had the library we needed.Hopefully Kindle will quickly begin to expand this section of their readers this year. Crossing our fingers..."
5,Can't put it down!!!,I love my Kindle. I can't stop reading as you can tell on my Shop Kindle list.The only thing I can't figure out is how to delete books I have read. Can anyone help me with this?
4,Love it !!!,"I love my new Kindle, which I received as a christmas present. BUT I am a little unsure how long I will have to wait for the most up-to-date copies of my favourite authors new books. I am a huge fan of Lee Childs and Harlan Coben, but their most recent releases are not available on Kindle yet. Another favourite is J A (Jack) Kerley and again he is not available - will I still have to buy these on PAPER to get my fix of my favourites ? Or will Kindle catch up with my reading needs ? Apart from that little moan, I love the ease of which I can choose and download a book in minutes, and my husband loves not having to follow me around book stores."
4,Getting A Bone Out of My Craw,"I bought a Kindle 2 & cover at the end of June as an anniversary present.My mate was pleased but protested that while it was the best of its class at that time, it was over-priced and he felt a bit uncomfortable that I had spent that much of my limited resources.Now, I am interested to note, you, too, feel it was over-priced. Somehow, looking at the figure $299 goes down hard when I look at my c.c. bill and see $387 (including the cover).If book downloads for Kindle were to be similarly discounted in the near future, it would take the sting out somewhat. I think that unlikely. Marilyn"
4,Simply amazing,"The new kindle is amazing. As soon as I got my hand on the Kindle, I bought a book and within 3 minutes I had the book on my Kindle. The ink on the book is like real ink. I can read it at all angles. The reading function works well and the pages are synchronized. This is still a beta model and I am looking forward to the next generation of Kindle with more multimedia functions!"
5,Perfect for those with vision problems and very user friendly.,"I purchased the Kindle2 for my mom for christmas. I gave it to her at Thanksgiving instead so she wouldn't have to wait. What a treat this is!!! She's in her 80s and has glaucoma so you can imagine how difficult things have been. She's able to read the Bible every day which is something that is very important. She didn't think she'd like it because she thought it was a ""computer"" but no... this is a very well made and designed product. The buttons are designed so that they can't be accidently pressed unlike the touch screen devices. The gray scale makes for less eye strain too.Another plus is the fact that there's no need to fumble with a heavy book. I purchased a cover when I ordered the Kindle2 and an extra power cable. You will want to protect your device and the cover in a bright color makes it easier to locate.Worth every penny for the enjoyment it's given."
5,Absolutely amazing!!,"I absolutely love my kindle. There are always going to be certain books that I might buy, but this is definetely great. I took it while traveling during thanskgiving. The battery life was awesome. I did buy a cover because my first kindle was damaged when i dropped it."
1,Bait & Switch,"I had assumed that when a product was advertised as being able to convert PDF files.......that it would, including formating and graphs of a normal PDF. This is untrue, and considering that 95% of all PDF's that I read have formating and graphs, I find this product useless for PDF's.I find that Kindle books are on the short side. Numerous books that I'm interested in are not available.From a newspaper sources, maneuvering from article to article is more time consuming then just reading RRS on the iPhone. And the little 5 way button will drive you crazy in the process.But if you wait another 3 months Jeff will come out with something that will make the device that you just purchase useless.So, just keep waiting."
1,Kindle 2 broke down,"My Kindle 2 has seemed to break down...(with books you don't have this horror)...Went to turn it on tonight and is showing a blank screen...Amazon has not given anyone to turn to when this happens and it really is horrible...lost my faith in this machine...should've bought the Sony compatible one...I am very frustrated, it cost my husband close to 400 hundred dollars and I didn't get it till March...Now, I am stuck investing in books I can no longer read from a manufacture that does not even an alternative or phone number for this type of disaster...very annoyed thinking of getting a lawyer...and yes the batteries are fully charged :( UPDATE: MY HUSBAND PHONE AMAZON AND THEY ARE FIXING THE PROBLEM..> WILL LET EVERYONE KNOW THE FINAL OUTCOME...."
2,Sorry not good for computer books,I love my Kindle. It provides easy access to newspapers and books. Kindle puts the code in Computer books as an image rather than as text which leaves the code text very tiny and unreadable. This is very disappointing. Sorry.
3,Cost is the issue,"I don't own a Kindle, but I have used both versions. The new one is much better in the ways that several owners have suggested. For me, though, the issue is cost. Until the price comes below $100, I just can't see buying it. When I can buy a full netbook computer for less, this price just seems unreasonable. Yes, it's a great way to carry around my library, but most of those are in print, not digital form at this point. Yes, it's very light and small, but then I have to carry my computer all the time anyway, so it just doesn't simplify my life, it adds one more thing that I would need to carry around."
2,Not a great gift,"I bought this for my blind mother. She didn't want it as she is already in blind program that sends her books by the tons to listen to, even providing the taper recorder to listen to them on. Ask before you buy. I had to return although it is a great item. Just not needed in my family."
4,New Software Version (Kindle 2),"After the recent software upgrade Kindle 2 has the ability to process native pdf files. That is great for someone like me who has lots of pdfs. The device is now able to function in both portrait and landscape orientations (like the Sony e-reader). As before, I can transfer the pdfs from a computer to my Kindle 2 using the USB cable (I have confidential documents that I would not feel comfortable sending to Amazon.com for conversion).The only thing the Kindle pdf reader is missing is a zoom function - that's why I gave it 4 stars only. Great upgrade, very well timed to compete with the Barnes & Noble Nook."
4,Kindle great - shame about titles available in Australia,"As a device, this is an excellent book reader. No eye strain and very portable. It is a shame though that you cannot download any of the new titles available due to copyright restrictions (I am in Australia). I can buy and ship in traditional form - but not electronically. Except for this I would love the device."
4,MoreTitles Please,"I absolutely love the functionality of the device. It fully lives up to the hype.My grouse is with the available titles in my book genre of choice - fantasy.It's very disappointing! While I accept that building the library is a work in progress, I would have hoped that many obvious fantasy titles currently not available would long since have been included. It's something the Kindle librarians need to address urgently, if the service is going to meet customer needs in this important market."
3,Not Happy with the Downloads Available,"I received a Kindle DX for XMas and am not entirely happy with the content available for downloading. The last 4 books I tried to purchase were not available in Kindle format. What is going on with Kindle? Really, really disappointing!"
4,its a e-book!,"Positive: light, good storage capacity, optimum glare-free screen, 3G free, long battery life.Negative: bad scroll key, Internet access very slow, even in basic mode.Meets very well the role of e-book!You can not require that it have the performance as a net or note book.It was not made for that...!"
2,So Disappointed in Kindle Battery,"I have had my Kindle for a year and the battery will no longer hold a charge even when not used. The wireless is NOT on. I am trying to find a replacement battery but Amazon is not clear as to which one will work with this model. I tried ""2nd Generation Kindle Replacement Battery"" and nothing comes up. They didn't tell me I would have to invest $20+ per year in purchasing new batteries!! :( I wish I would have purchased an alternate product (not Kindle)."
2,not worth the money,"I was very excited to receive my kindle, but after just 6 months, lines appeared on my screen. I returned it, and got a new one, but the exact same thing happened a 2nd time after about a year and a half. because my warranty had expired, I am not able to get a replacement. I am not pleased with this kindle at all. I would recommend the nook instead."
5,Love it!,I am in love with my Kindle. I can't believe how cheaps the books are and how quickly they come.
4,Good product with price drop sting,Product is adequate but Amazon dropped price $50 2 days after I purchased - lousy timing.
4,Love it.,"I haven't really used my new kindle too much yet. I am busy finishing up an actual book book, but I have done some browsing. I love everything about it except that sometimes the internet connection is a little slow."
4,Kindle abroad / Gift.,"HI, the Kindle is really Great. The pre set-up already installed worked 100% with Downloading and the user information was really simple and well done. I can only recommend this reader. What is only missing is that if you give this item away as gift - how the user makes set up for own account and enevtually the pre-set up should be changed til the recievers name. Michael Gervig, Denmark.Kindle DX Wireless Reading Device (9.7"" Display, U.S. Wireless, Latest Generation)"
2,kindle,"several points:1- not enough academic books2- not enough reduction prices on academic ebooks. Paperbook3- pdf. files are not easy to read for a long period. U must change that when you create your kindle app store.4- provide more opportunity to read different types of format5- ABOVE ALL, THE CLICKS AND LIGHTS WHEN YOU CHANGE PAGE PROVOKE HEADACHE IF I READ FOR MORE THAN 1H30 MN.Apart from that, it is practical.I would appreciate to have some feedbackrgds"
3,Book Selection,"This is a great concept. Easy to use and to read. I have no problems with the design or the performance. My problem is with the selection of books available. Don't expect much beyond currently published books. No Saul Bellow, no Catcher in the Rye, no Thornton Wilder, no Naked and the Dead, etc."
4,We should own the books we buy,"Why is it that this is the only way I can ""buy"" books but not own them. In every other format, I can lend books to friends. Why not with this one?"
3,There is a big problem with mathematical equations,"Actually I like my Kindle and reading books on this device is quite nice, I do not need to carry lots of books and this is a big news. E-ink technology is cool and I hate reading books on computer screens.My main purpose of buying Kindle was reading statistical books however mathematical equations fonts are not still well developed in Kindle books I have many problems with the wrong displaying of mathematical equations on Kindle I've written to the Kindle support team about this problem one month ago and they replied me they will fix it soon ( they did not do anything so far). I need some new books but I am not going to buy them until my current books are fixed."
3,Need a backlight,"I just got this for Christmas for my wife. She loves reading with this. I've already downloaded several books onto it already. The only problem that I've found thus far is that it does not come with a backlight. I love to read all times of the day and hate the fact that after spending $259 for this thing, I have to spend another $20 plus on a light. It would be beneficial to add it to the kindle instead of having it as an accessory.I'm going to try this out for a month or so and add to this review. Maybe at that time, I will be able to bump it up to a 5 star. I'm just disappointed in the additional money for a light. With the additional light, you have to add a carrying case or something to be able to use it but in the bed at night, I wouldn't want to have to hold a case."
2,"Nice device, not all content available internationally","Received my Kindle today, and was pleasantly surprised with the device. It feels nice in your hand, its easy to read on, all as advertised.My only complain with the hardware would be the navigation buttons (next page) could be a little softer to click.My BIGGEST complaint is that NOT ALL Kindle content is available internationally. I currently live in Mexico and cannot get most of the newer books . i.e. Dan Brown's ""The Lost Symbol"". This is certainly a big issue if you are planning on buying the device.There is a drop down menu on the international Kindle page that states how many books are available for your country. Amazon's does say it is adding international content everyday."
5,OMG!!! I'm blown away!!!,"I did my research and thought about it for a long while before ordering the Kindle2. I have always been a voracious reader, and, until recently, had a library in my home. I can't tell you how many horrible moves those boxes and boxes and boxes of heavy books went through. Anyway, when we did away with the library I decided to save some trees and go electronic. While I was resigned to doing it, I thought it would take some serious getting-used-to. Boy! Was I wrong! I've loved this thing from the minute I liberated it from the box, and I've never looked back! The unit itself is a marvel, and the convenience of WhisperNet is just decadent!!! I have absolutely NO regrets about spending the big bucks. I am glad I procrastinated until 2 came out."
4,Very cool,I love the feel and weight of this. The ability to purchase books right on the device is smooth and quick. I LOVE the feature of being able to change the font size. My only complaint is that any illustrations or pictures in the books loaded display in a very poor quality.
5,Wonderful Product,"I love the Kindle. I always have several books ""going"" at one time. This enables me to carry them all with me and easily switch between books. I'm not a huge nonfiction reader, but with Kindle, I am reading more nonfiction. I am able to switch between both genres quickly and keep engaged in both."
3,Look for books BEFORE you buy.,"I travel weekly and enjoy having my local paper every morning no matter where I am. However, I am disappointed with the selection of books.I've looked for Ray Bradbuy, Patrick O'Brian, James A. Mitchener and several other authors only to find kindle doesn't carry their books. It seems as though most of the books I look for are not available. My understanding is that Amazon cannot come to agreement with a few publishing houses and that limits what is available for the Kindle. My recommendation would be to look for the books you think you would enjoy BEFORE purchasing an ebook reader.Good for newspapers if you travel, so-so for book collections.Good luck."
2,Kindle,"It is ok. A bit limited in what it can do. I have not yet embraced the whole wireless book concept, but I am hoping to start using my Kindle more in the near future."
2,not enough specialty books available,"There are not enough books available for this device (at least for me). I don't really mind reading occasional fiction on kindle, but there's little to none specialty books such as theology, history of religion kind of book. And this is frustrating. I don't even mind paying full amount price of a hard copy for a kindle version of a book, but it isn't available. Mostly, popular stuff. And one more thing-formatting sometimes is very unfriendly. In general, I somewhat disappointed in Kindle, I still have to buy plenty of paper books because those aren't available for Kindle"
5,Love my new Kindle...,A friend passed on her Gen 1 Kindle to me and I read one book on it and was hooked! Now I just bought this new Kindle and am so happy! And I'm following my friend's lead and sharing the Kindle love. I've passed the Gen 1 model on to another friend. :)
4,Love it!!!,"The day I ordered Kindle 2, the Kindle DX came out. I almost changed my order. However, this size is perfect for my needs. Light, fits in my bag, coupled with the light when in bed, I don't disturb others. When traveling, all my reading materials at hand. Have read in full sunshine, no problem. Purchased the case that doubles as a stand. I couldn't be more delighted."
4,Impressions of a new user,"I have only today started using my Kindle, which was given to me as an Anniversary gift by my wife.I find it extremely easy to use and the clarity of the print is superb. The system is very cleverly designed, is intuitive and virtually idiot proof. I was very impressed to find that my Kindle was already partly charged when I opened the box - this meant that I could start reading and downloading straight away instead of waiting for several hours until it was charged up. The size of the unit is perfect and everything is exactly where my hand reaches for it. I love the context-sensitive menus and the ease of downloading new books.If I have any major criticisms at this early stage, they would be that (a)unlike the US model there is no mains adaptor for charging and (b) There appears to be a slight image ""burn in"" left on the screen after using the machine. I hope it isn't permanent."
4,A Readers Delight,"The Kindle is the best investment I made in reading. If schools had the Kindle more children would be reading. You can take a Kindle anywhere. It makes it easier for them to understand words, since the dictionary is conveniently included. They can't say they forgot the book, since it can be downloaded at anytime."
3,Price drop,"While my husband likes the Kindle, I am really disappointed that they've dropped the price dramatically and are not offering anything to the people that just bought them at the higher price."
2,overpriced item,It does what it says and yet somehow I would rather read a regular book and it is way overpriced at 269 dollars JUST to read a book!!! that is ridiculous!
5,Love the Kindle 2,"I received my Kindle 2 yesterday and really love it. The screen is extremely easy to read and the feel of it in your hands is great. I do wish it had shipped with a case, but a great product it is."
